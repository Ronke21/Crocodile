<text>Laurel Hill is a city in Okaloosa County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Crestview–Fort Walton Beach–Destin, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 584 at the 2020 US Census, up from 537 at the 2010 census. 

==History==
The area which is now Laurel Hill was one of the first post-American annexation, English-speaking settlements in Florida. There had been settlements by English-speaking loyalists in Florida during the American Revolution. Settlers were documented establishing a community, originally known as &quot;Almirante&quot;, soon after Florida&#x27;s acquisition by the United States in 1821.

In the 1880s, railroad access to north-west Florida opened up a booming lumber industry, with the Yellow River Railroad reaching the Almirante (Laurel Hill) area by 1892. In 1895, Almirante, then just a small logging and farming community, was platted and renamed Laurel Hill, the name purportedly inspired by a large laurel tree which grew in the center of the community. Growing rapidly, the community was officially incorporated as the &quot;City of Laurel Hill&quot; by the Florida Legislature in 1905.

Although in 1915, Laurel Hill was the largest community in newly created Okaloosa County, the town lost out becoming Okaloosa&#x27;s county seat to the more centrally located town of Crestview. Laurel Hill&#x27;s economic fortunes went into a decline after World War I, a waning intensified by the Florida land speculation collapse of the 1920s, which resulted in the closing of Laurel Hill&#x27;s only bank. In order to install infrastructure improvements and to re-stimulate the community, Laurel Hill was officially reincorporated as a municipality on June 2, 1953.

Once served by the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad, which purchased the Yellow River Railroad in 1906, the line was abandoned and lifted in the 1980s.

First held in 1992, the Laurel Hill Hobo Festival is an annual event scheduled for the first Saturday in October.

== Libraries ==
The idea of a public library was first proposed on February 4, 1974, to the then Mayor Tom Pryor. The library was first named the Mary Esther Community Library. It was run by volunteers and not tax supported. The original building was only 585 square feet, with annual fees ranging from $1.00 per person to $5.00 for a family. The building was later able to get an expansion to 810 square feet. The Mary Esther Community Library was then renamed in October 1976 to the current name of the Mary Esther Public Library. In 1988 when the space for the library was deemed too small, the Friends of the Library group created a petition for the citizens calling on the City Council to build a newer, bigger library. On February 6, 1989, the City Council approved the new site and size of the library. While the new library was being built the state of Florida also elected to give $175,000 in matching funds to help with construction. Ground was broken on February 28, 1991, and the new Mary Esther Public Library opened to the public on March 9, 1992. Throughout the history of the Mary Esther Public Library there was talk of an Okaloosa County Library System, but it was repeatedly denied. The Okaloosa County Public Library Cooperative eventually formed in 1997 with Mary Esther as one of the member libraries. The library received its most recent renovation in 2004 after receiving a $350,000 grant, adding an additional 2,000 square feet.

<text>Shalimar is a town in Okaloosa County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Crestview–Fort Walton Beach–Destin, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 737 at the 2020 census, up from 717 at the 2010 census.

==History==
During the First World War Germany stopped shipping dye to the United States. Silas Gibson was contracted to build a dye plant at Black Pointe. W. N. Hartgrove taught at a school at the dye plant. Dances and a &quot;Hallowe&#x27;en social&quot; would be hosted at the dye plant. The plant would close sometime in the early 1920s. In the 1950s a myth would spread that 130 Germans operated the dye plant and it was &quot;actually an explosives factory and probably a submarine base as well.&quot;

&quot;In February 1927, the Choctawhatchee and Northern Railroad was chartered &#x27;To construct, acquire, maintain, lease, or operate a line of railroad or railroads from a point between Galliver and Crestview on the Louisville and Nashville Railroad in Okaloosa County, to a point in said county on Choctawhatchee Bay, a distance of approximately twenty-eight miles.&#x27; On Garnier&#x27;s Bayou near the present Eglin (Air Force Base) housing development of Shalimar, a $29,000,000 Port Dixie Harbor and Terminal Company was chartered to build wharves for liners, a rail line north, and a city of one square mile, with streets 100 feet wide.&quot; These ambitious plans would not see fruition.

Originally an area called &quot;Port Dixie&quot;, the town &quot;sprang up out of the woods&quot; in 1943–1944 as a community of 160 houses to be used as housing for military officers by developer Clifford H. Meigs.

Badly needed new homes were constructed beginning in 1942 by Clifford Meigs and his associates to provide adequate facilities for commissioned officers assigned at the rapidly expanding Eglin Field, immediately north of what was initially referred to as &quot;Shalimar Park&quot;. This land was acquired from James E. Plew. The first 50 homes were almost complete by May, with another 25 underway, with the entire project costing approximately $350,000. The Plew Heights housing project near Valparaiso, Florida had been erected in 1941 to take care of civil service employees and enlisted personnel, but the government made no provision for commissioned officers.

A new post office opened in Shalimar on July 1, 1943, with Clifford H. Meigs serving as the first postmaster. Previously, mail for the new community was handled through Valparaiso, Florida.

The &quot;Town of Shalimar&quot; was officially incorporated as a municipality in June 1947, and Clifford Meigs served as its first mayor. The incorporation was directly related to state law that prohibited clubs in unincorporated areas from staying open from midnight Saturday until Monday morning, which would negatively impact the gambling operations at the casino of the Shalimar Club, the opening of which &quot;was the social event of 1947.&quot; The Fort Walton Beach [sic - Fort Walton did not become Fort Walton Beach until June 1953] places were doing a booming business on the weekends while there were rumors that the sheriff might enforce the law in Shalimar and close the place there,&quot; Meigs told the &quot;Playground News&quot; in 1959. &quot;The owner came to me and suggested incorporation, and while I didn&#x27;t think I had much to gain then, I agreed. With only about three other freeholders in the area, it was a simple matter to get incorporated.&quot; The reprieve on gambling would be temporary, however. &quot;The collapse of Okaloosa gambling was brought about by the glare of outside publicity, reform zeal from within and the direct intervention of Gov. Fuller Warren. The first wind of adversity was blown by the &quot;Tampa Tribune&quot;&#x27;s exposé of gambling in Fort Walton.&quot; The 1949 article led to the governor suspending Okaloosa County Sheriff Isle Enzor and two constables in 1950 for failure to enforce the state gambling laws. The popular Enzor was reelected in 1952 but gambling was on the way out. &quot;Back on the job and converted to the cause, Sheriff Enzor began cracking down, and soon even the Shalimar Club was turning to more &#x27;legitimate&#x27; forms of entertainment. But without gambling, it was just another nightspot. The Shalimar closed for good in 1956.&quot;

In 1948, the town features included the Shalimar Store, the Shalimar Service Station, and lumberman and Shalimar resident Roger Clary&#x27;s Shalimar Club. The 160 residences were rented through Shalimar Homes and Meigs Homes corporations.

In 1950, the 280-car capacity Florida Drive-In Theatre, erected at a cost of ~$40,000, at the junction of Ferry Road and State Road 85, later Eglin Parkway, the main road between the air force base and Fort Walton, Florida, opened on Thursday, June 15, with an Esther Williams picture, &quot;On an Island with You&quot;. Operated by the James K. Tringas family, that also built the Tringas Theatre in Fort Walton in 1940 (which is, ironically, still in business and being refurbished to its former glory in 2019), the drive-in would close in the fall of 1973. This property is now occupied by the Shalimar United Methodist Church family life center and a furniture store, which property is also owned by the church.

The Louis Woodham Concrete Company, which would provide construction materials for the growing Shalimar area, was established at Dixie Point at the end of Ferry Road by 1956, and would survive into the late 1970s before being replaced by condominiums. It was regularly supplied by towboats with barges of raw materials which transited across the Choctawhatchee Bay from the Intracoastal Waterway on the south edge of the bay. A Coast Guard tripod navigation marker in the bay just offshore of Meig&#x27;s Beach, Port Dixie, was removed after merchant commerce ceased to Ferry Point. The end of water deliveries to Ferry Point marked the last gasp of &quot;Port Dixie&quot; as once envisioned.

Clifford Meigs served as mayor until his death in 1960, and was succeeded by his brother Clyde Meigs in November, who had served as a councilman. The first elected mayor was James P. Tras, in 1965, followed by Sarah Tras for a two to three-year term. She had been married to Clifford Meigs at the time of his death, and is the wife of Jim Tras, . Residential Meigs Drive, paralleling the Choctawhatchee Bay, Clifford Drive and Sara Drive are all named for the town&#x27;s founding family. Carl Brandt Drive and Gardner Drive are named for former Eglin AFB commanders.

During World War II, Eglin water range 60 was located in the bay immediately south of Port Dixie, with a battleship-size target float anchored off of Black’s Point.

The Lake Lorraine area at Black&#x27;s Point to the east of the incorporated Shalimar community was developed in the 1970s, but carries a Shalimar postal address.

The Poquito Bayou area north of the incorporated Shalimar also carries a Shalimar postal address.

The mostly residential area of Okaloosa County between Shalimar and Lake Lorraine continues to be referred to as Port Dixie.

A mix of office parks (many occupied by military contractors), restaurants, convenience stores with fuel islands, a furniture store, a Fairfield Inn by Marriott hotel, and other assorted small firms comprise the short business corridor. For a time in the 1960s–1970s, the Central Intelligence Agency had &quot;front&quot; offices in Shalimar. This office may have been involved as a test project office for the Lockheed U-2, with which Fort Walton Beach resident, World War II exile Polish pilot, and CIA officer, Ksawery Wyrożemski was involved, but which was a cover for CIA flight operations out of Duke Field. Okaloosa County Sheriff&#x27;s offices are located in Shalimar. An Okaloosa County courthouse annex, erected in 1975 on land made available by the Meigs family, was razed in the last week of June 2014, after standing vacant for several years. Ground was broken on 29 September 2014 for a new $12 million 64,000 square foot 3-story Okaloosa County Administration Building on the former courthouse annex site. The new facility, under construction by Lord and Son, will house a variety of services, including a large space for County Commission meetings, Supervisor of Elections events, a gross management department, information systems, as well as facilities for the tax collector and supervisor of elections.

==Education==
Some of the land that Clifford Meigs owned was donated to Okaloosa County for the establishment of a school. When it was finished it was named Choctawhatchee (Choctaw for short) High School, opening September 22, 1952. In 1969 the area needed a middle school, so Okaloosa School District built a new high school in Fort Walton Beach. The previous school was renamed to Clifford Meigs Junior High School, later Clifford Meigs Middle School (Meigs Middle School for short). The football field is known as Meigs Stadium (which is now named in honor of a passed coach). Meigs Middle School, Shalimar Elementary School and Longwood Elementary School are currently (2009) A Schools according to the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test. Clifford Meigs Middle School is now an A+ school (2013) In fact, most schools in the Okaloosa County School District are A schools in 2009.

==Library==
The Shalimar Library was established in 1996 when resident Janet Casanova gathered residents interested in opening a non-profit library for the town. Founding member Velma Bruner rented out a small log cabin behind the Aegean restaurant off Eglin Parkway, which the volunteers turned into a library-thrift shop. In 2017, the library was moved to a larger facility at 115 Richbourg Avenue, where it still stands in 2021.

The building was designed by retired architect Allen Hemmer, who took on the task as a volunteer. The new location is thought to be the final resting place of a founder of the Fort Walton Beach community, Augustus &quot;Gus&quot; Tart. A former slave, Tart became a known hunting and fishing expert in the community, and the library has created a memorial for Tart with a fenced off area and new headstone.

As per their official website, the volunteers and members of the library &quot;are concerned citizens who share the belief that a strong library is a valuable intellectual, cultural, educational, and recreational resource in the community.&quot; The library is run entirely by volunteers which number over 50 as of 2020. It is supported by membership fines and earnings from the thrift store hosted within the building. The thrift store runs off of donations from the Shalimar community, including clothing, shoes, toys, excess books, and more.

Library membership may be acquired with a $15 fine renewable yearly, and is available to any resident of Okaloosa County. The membership includes access to a growing collection of books, CDs and magazines, eligibility to participate in the adult book discussion and children&#x27;s programs, as well as Internet Access.

<text>Valparaiso is a city in Okaloosa County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Crestview–Fort Walton Beach–Destin, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 4,752, down from 5,036 at the 2010 census.

==History==

Valparaiso was named after Valparaiso, Indiana (which in turn, was named after Valparaiso, Chile) and is a twin city also with its neighboring city, Niceville. The name of the city is Spanish, and translates to &quot;paradise vale&quot; or &quot;paradise valley&quot;.

Chicago businessman James E. Plew, who relocated to the Florida Panhandle of Northwest Florida in 1922, became &quot;one of Northwest Florida&#x27;s pioneer developers,&quot; and settled on Valparaiso &quot;as the most likely spot for development.

In 1924, he founded the Bank of Valparaiso, constructed the Valparaiso Inn, organized the Chicago Country Club which constructed the Valparaiso Country Club golf course, and was instrumental in many other development activities in the community.&quot;

&quot;Other interests of Mr. Plew included the founding of the Shalimar Winery, which was established to use the surplus grape crop of the county. He also founded the Valparaiso Novelty Company, helped to establish a knitting mill in the community and was interested in a number of other enterprises to which he made investments to help their development.&quot;

Plew thought that a military payroll would boost the depression-stricken economy of the region. He leased from the city of Valparaiso the Valparaiso Airport, an arrowhead-shaped parcel of cleared in 1933 as an airdrome.

In 1934, Plew offered the U.S. government contiguous land for a bombing and gunnery base. This leasehold became the headquarters for the Valparaiso Bombing and Gunnery Base activated on June 14, 1935, under the command of Captain Arnold H. Rich. This was the founding of Eglin Air Force Base. The field was assigned the ICAO airport code VPS for Valparaiso, which Destin-Fort Walton Beach Airport retains to this day. In Niceville, there is an elementary school named in his honor.

In the 1930s, Okeechobee was the commercial center for the surrounding area, shipping hundreds of train cars of winter vegetables annually. It had poultry farms, a catfish shipping plant, and a bullfrog breeding industry.

The Florida guide described bullfrog breeding in the Okeechobee region:

<text>Apopka is a city in Orange County, Florida. The city&#x27;s population was 54,873 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area. &quot;Apopka&quot; comes from Seminole word &quot;Ahapopka&quot; for &quot;potato-eating place&quot;.

Apopka is referred to as the &quot;Indoor Foliage Capital of the World&quot; due to the many greenhouse nurseries there.

==History==
The earliest known inhabitants of the Apopka area were the Acuera people, members of the Timucua confederation. They had disappeared by 1730, probably decimated by diseases transmitted through Florida by Spanish colonists.

The Acuera were succeeded by refugees from Alabama and Georgia, who formed the new Seminole Indian tribe. They called the area &quot;Ahapopka&quot;. Aha, meaning &quot;Potato,&quot; and papka, meaning &quot;eating place&quot;. By the 1830s, this settlement numbered about 200, and was the birthplace of the chief Coacoochee (known in English as &quot;Wild Cat&quot;).

At the conclusion of the Second Seminole War, the U.S. Congress passed the Armed Occupation Act of 1842, forcing surviving natives at Ahapopka to abandon their village and seek refuge deeper in the wilderness of the Florida peninsula.

The early American settlers built a major trading center on the foundations of the earlier Indian settlement. Their population was large enough by 1857 to support the establishment of a Masonic lodge. In 1859 the lodge erected a permanent meeting place at what is now the intersection of Main Street (U.S. Highway 441) and Alabama Avenue. 

===The Lodge===
The settlers in the vicinity of &quot;The Lodge&quot; were largely isolated during the Civil War, but the area rebounded once peace was re-established, and a population boom followed the construction of railroad lines through the region.

In 1869, the Apopka Post Office opened.

===Town of Apopka City===
In 1882, the one mile in each direction of &quot;The Lodge&quot; or &quot;Fudge Hall&quot; was officially incorporated under the name &quot;Town of Apopka City&quot;. In the 1890s, the town was contracted in size more than once due to difficult times.

In 1905, the Apopka City Council authorized incorporation of the Apopka Water, Light, and Ice Company. Councilman A.M. Starbird was appointed its manager, but it was not until voters approved a $9,000 bond in 1914 that he was able to contract with International Harvester Corporation to construct a power plant; as such, electricity was not available in the city until February 10, 1915. This independent utility company was one of many that were acquired by the Florida Public Service Corporation in the 1920s. They continued to manage the city&#x27;s utility needs until the 1940s, when they sold off its ice plants to the Atlantic Company, its electric service to Florida Power Corporation, and its water services to Florida Utilities.

Between 1937 and 1968, a town ordinance forbade Black residents from living north of the railroad tracks.

===Historic buildings===
Five buildings in Apopka have been placed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places through the Apopka Historical Society housed in the Museum of the Apopkans.

==Present-day Apopka==

Apopka is known for having one of the longest-serving mayors in the United States. John H. Land, first elected in 1949, served for over 61 years (with a short three-year gap), making him the longest-serving mayor in Florida and longest-serving full-time mayor in the United States through 2014. Apopka is served by the Apopka Police Department within city limits and the Orange County Sheriff&#x27;s Department for unincorporated Apopka.

On April 8, 2014, Apopka City Commissioner Joe Kilsheimer won the election to succeed John H. Land as mayor. Kilsheimer was sworn in on April 22, 2014. The 2018 primary for mayor resulted in a landslide win for Bryan Nelson with 63.40% (4,103) of the vote to Kilsheimer&#x27;s 36.6% (2,369). No runoff was required.

===Mayors of the City of Apopka===
* An asterisk indicates discontiguous terms of service.

* 1882 to 1923 elections were held annually. Then every three years. Then four years as the city election codes were changed.

===Development===
Apopka is a fast-growing city and is expanding in all directions. Most notable are the new stores to the north of the city on US 441 in the location of the previous Dunn Citrus grove (the stretch of 441 which runs through the city is named after Fred N. Dunn). Due to the fast-paced growth of the city, a new hospital, AdventHealth Apopka, was opened in 2017.

The John Land Apopka Expressway (Toll 414) opened on May 15, 2009, relieving some of US 441&#x27;s traffic, taking the route from what is now the US 441 junction with SR 429, and then passing south of the city to rejoin US 441 at its junction with Maitland Boulevard South of the city.

Expansion of the expressway, including an extension of Toll 414, known as Wekiva Parkway, created a junction at US 441 and Plymouth Sorrento Road. Master plans take the Wekiva Parkway extension further north and then east connecting to Interstate 4 at Sanford. The expansion is scheduled to be completed by 2023. It will then be the shortest route from I-4 to the Disney attractions.

<text>Bay Lake is a city in Orange County, Florida, United States. The population was 29 at the 2020 census. It is named after a lake that lies east of the Magic Kingdom. All four of the Walt Disney World Resort theme parks, and one of Walt Disney World&#x27;s two water parks, are in Bay Lake, though all Disney parks in the region have mailing addresses in nearby Lake Buena Vista.

Bay Lake is one of two Florida municipalities inside the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District (formerly the Reedy Creek Improvement District) which also includes Walt Disney World, the other being Lake Buena Vista. The Bay Lake is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Chapter 67-1104 of the Laws of Florida, incorporating the City of Bay Lake, was signed into law by Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. on May 12, 1967, the same day he also signed chapters 67-764 (creating the Reedy Creek Improvement District, or RCID), also known as the Reedy Creek Improvement Act, and 67-1965 (incorporating the City of Reedy Creek). It was and still is located fully inside the RCID, and all its duties have been taken care of by the RCID. As fully described in Reedy Creek Improvement District, the city has always been controlled by the Walt Disney Company and has allowed them powers that other area attractions have not had.

Chapter 69-836 of the Laws of Florida, which became a law on July 3, 1969, without the governor&#x27;s approval, redefined the city boundaries to exclude the easternmost part of Bay Lake. Chapter 69–1527, which became a law the same day, completely moved the city of Reedy Creek, with the land given up by Bay Lake included in the new city. Since then, Bay Lake has expanded to fill the original RCID west of Bonnet Creek, but the Reedy Creek Improvement District has expanded to include new land not in the city.

The RCID had all the powers of the city and more, raising the question of why cities were incorporated inside of it. Walt Disney&#x27;s original plans for the site included at least one futuristic living area, a planned &quot;community of the future&quot;. This was never built, but some of the ideas were incorporated into the EPCOT theme park. The later Celebration, Florida was deannexed from the city and the RCID in 1994 so the Walt Disney Company would not lose control of the district. The city is exclusively inhabited by Disney employees and their immediate families, residing in a community on the north shore of Bay Lake (on Bay Court). The only landowners are wholly owned subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company, rights-of-way for state and county roads, and five five-acre (2.0 ha) parcels owned by senior Disney employees to grant them voting power in the Reedy Creek Improvement District.

==Geography==
The approximate coordinates for the City of Bay Lake is located at (28.391502, –81.566659).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (5.86%) is water.

The principal border that divides the cities of Lake Buena Vista to the east and Bay Lake to the west is the canal called Bonnet Creek, adjacent to Bonnet Creek Parkway. Most of the attractions associated with the Walt Disney World Resort are actually located within the City of Bay Lake, including all four theme parks.

The only long-term residents in Bay Lake live in a mobile home park on Bay Court, a street which, in 1987, was a dirt road. As of that year many employees wished to live in Bay Lake or Lake Buena Vista due to their proximity to their jobs.

=== Climate ===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild winters. According to the Köppen climate classification, the City of Bay Lake has a humid subtropical climate zone (&quot;Cfa&quot;).

==Demographics==
===2010 and 2020 census===
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 29 people, 20 households, and 4 families residing in the city.

As of the 2010 United States census, there were 47 people, 6 households, and 4 families residing in the city.

===2000 census===

As of the census of 2000, there were 23 people, 9 households, and 6 families residing in the city. The population density was 1.2 inhabitants per square mile (0.4/km). There were 9 housing units at an average density of 0.5 per square mile (0.2/km). The racial makeup of the city was twenty-two whites (95.7%) and one African American (4.3%). None of the people in Bay Lake were Asian, Native American, Pacific Islanders, other races, multiracial people, or Hispanics or Latinos.

In 2000, there were nine households in Bay Lake, out of which three had children under the age of 18 living with them, five had married couples living together, one had a female householder with no husband present, and three of the households were non-families. Three households were made up of individuals, and one consisted of someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.56 and the average family size was 3.00.

In 2000, the median income for a household in the city was $86,288, and the median income for a family was $86,288. Males had a median income of $76,284 versus $21,667 for females. The per capita income for the city was $26,731. None of the population and none of the families were below the poverty line.

Because of Bay Lake statistics, legislators have to be careful not to use the words &quot;maximum&quot; and &quot;average&quot; in the computations used for the State of Florida&#x27;s 2007 property tax reform debate. For example, in 2006, the &quot;per capita levy&quot; of property tax in Bay Lake was $176,230. Since the statewide average that year was $475, legislators have had to be careful to distinguish the phrase &quot;average savings&quot; from the phrase &quot;savings by the average taxpayer.&quot;

<doc id="109526" wikidata="Q2429053" url="?curid=109526" title="Bithlo, Florida">
<text>Bithlo is a census-designated place and an unincorporated community in Orange County, Florida, United States. The population was 8,268 at the 2010 census, up from 4,626 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The Bithlo Post Office opened in 1922. For 20 years in the early 20th century, Bithlo was an incorporated town, but in 1929 ceased to function as a town due to economic hardship. By 1941, the town council meetings had ended and in 1944 the Okeechobee Railroad Branch was abandoned. After the end of World War II, the town became known as a waste dump and pollution site. It was in 1970 when the residents of Bithlo petitioned the state legislature to revoke the town&#x27;s charter.

<text>Eatonville is a town in Orange County, Florida, United States, six miles north of Orlando. It is part of Greater Orlando. Incorporated on August 15, 1887, it was one of the first self-governing all-black municipalities in the United States. (Brooklyn, Illinois, incorporated July 8, 1873, is the oldest incorporated Black town in the U.S.) The &quot;Eatonville Historic District&quot; and Moseley House Museum are in Eatonville. Author Zora Neale Hurston grew up in Eatonville and the area features in many of her stories. 
The Robert Hungerford Normal and Industrial School was founded in 1897 to provide education for black students in grades 6-12 and taught children for over 100 years.

In 1990, the town founded the Zora Neale Hurston Museum of Fine Arts. Every winter the town stages the Zora Neale Hurston Festival of the Arts and Humanities. A library named for her opened in January 2004.

The population was 2,349 at the 2020 census. The vast majority are Black or African American. Eatonville has no gas station, supermarket or pharmacy; only a Family Dollar. With a median household income of $27,000, the town is struggling to survive.

Artist Jules Andre Smith has done a series of paintings depicting life in Eatonville during the 1930s and 1940s. Twelve of these works are at the Maitland Art Center in the adjacent town of Maitland.

Eatonville is home to WESH and WKCF, two television stations serving the Orlando television market.

==History==
Ten years after the Emancipation Proclamation, formerly enslaved people migrated to rural Central Florida, finding work in the citrus groves. J.E. Clark and several friends attempted to purchase a block of land to establish a &quot;colony for colored people, but so great was the prejudice then existing against the Negro that no one would sell them land for such a purpose&quot;, according to Clark. Lewis Lawrence, originally from Utica, New York, agreed to help them in 1881. Lawrence convinced Captain Josiah Eaton, a neighbor and friend, to sell him 22 acres, which Lawrence subdivided. Upon each lot he had a small house constructed and instructed an agent to sell them. An article in the Tallahassee &quot;Weekly Floridian&quot; newspaper titled, &quot;A Negro Colony in Florida&quot; stated,

A Negro settlement has been established at Maitland...which is divided into forty-eight lots, 50x50 feet, to be sold to Negroes at from $19 to $30 per lot. Mr. Lawrence has erected on this land a framed church 30x20 feet, a bell for which has been presented by the Congregational Sabbath School of Chelsea, Connecticut. No liquor is ever to be sold or given away on the ground; no gambling or disreputable house of any kind will ever be allowed, under a forfeiture of the purchase.

In 1884, the &quot;Orange County Reporter&quot; wrote about the “colored village at Maitland, sometimes known as Lawrence, the name of its worthy founder”. Mr. Lawrence requested that the settlement use the name Eatonville. The following year, Maitland incorporated using votes from Black people, and at least one Black man was elected as a town officer. A year after incorporation, there were &quot;discussions of separation as a peaceful, progressive-minded, mutually beneficial solution to the so-called &#x27;race problem&#x27;.” While sources seem to disagree on the exact date and year of the town&#x27;s incorporation, the town&#x27;s official site provides a detailed account of the process and the dates.

The Town of Eatonville was officially incorporated as a municipality on August 15, 1887.

Jim Crow laws enforced segregation, violence and racial discrimination in the Southern United States in the late 19th century. The &quot;Eatonville Speaker&quot; newspaper printed an invitation in 1889:

“Colored People of the United States! Solve the Great Race Problem by Securing a Home in Eatonville, Florida, a Negro City Governed by Negroes.” The article describes Eatonville as a &quot;thriving community of 200-300 people — all colored, and NOT A WHITE FAMILY in the whole city.” The newspaper also recounts a near-lynching in Sanford, nineteen miles away.
Rev. Columbus H. Boger Sr. (1857-1918) was Eatonville&#x27;s first mayor, serving from 1887-1888. He edited the &quot;Florida Watchman&quot; newspaper. A Post Office opened at Eatonville in 1889, and closed in 1918.

Hurston&#x27;s novel &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; is set in the town and nearby communities, many of which have disappeared with the expansion of Greater Orlando.

Before the days of racial integration, Club Eaton was a popular stop on the Chitlin&#x27; Circuit, hosting performers ranging from B.B. King to Aretha Franklin,Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, The Platters, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday and James Brown.

Interstate 4 passes through the city limits, but there is no exit. The closest exits are Florida State Road 423 (to the south) and Florida State Road 414 (to the north).

== Education ==

The Robert Hungerford Normal and Industrial School was founded in 1897 for vocational education for Black students by Professor and Mrs. Russell C. Calhoun, a graduate of Tuskegee Institute. At that time, segregation in the South provided few opportunities for non-whites. The land was donated by E.C. Hungerford of Chester, Connecticut in memory of his physician son, Robert, who died of yellow fever. Cash donations came from across the country, including $400 from Booker T. Washington. The school was successful and more than 100 students were boarding in 1927, as well as local children attending and adult classes offered at night. Ten years later, Orange County provided bus transportation for black children from nearby Winter Park to attend the school. The school provided both vocational and college preparation, teaching English, Latin, history, general science, biology, algebra, geometry, industrial arts and home economics. Students could also learn bookkeeping and typing, physical education and agriculture. Programs for drafting and radio were added during the 1940s. The campus included girls &amp; boys dormitories, a dining hall, library, chapel, laundry, industrial training shops, home economics laboratory, equipment barn and farmland. To keep expenses down, students were assigned various duties around the campus including jobs at the school&#x27;s dairy, chicken coops, gardens and janitorial/maintenance of the institution&#x27;s classrooms and buildings. The school had been privately funded until the Orange County Public Schools (OCPS) took control in 1950. The Hungerford School was closed in 2010.

===Land===
The Hungerford campus had grown to in 1950, and was held in trust for the school. That land was almost 40% of the town of Eatonville. However, OCPS purchased the land from the trust in 1951 for about $16,000 with the stipulation that it be used &quot;for the education of Black children&quot;. Since the original purchase, OCPS has petitioned the courts multiple times to reduce the number of acres required to be used for the education of black children from 300 to 100 with OCPS receiving almost $8 million. The remaining parcel was appraised in 2019 for $20 million, but the OCPS announced their intention to sell the land to a developer for $14 million on March 31, 2023. The plans include a &quot;new community&quot; of 350 homes, apartments, retail businesses and restaurants. Existing residents claim the new development would wipe out the historic community and violate the land agreement, so locals are in a fight with the school board.

After buying 1000 acres, the majority of acreage still designated as United States Territory, he laid out a town and named it after his birthplace of Gotha, Germany. He then mailed promotional pamphlets to northern cities and to Europe advertising the warm climate and mild winters.

<doc id="109539" wikidata="Q2154539" url="?curid=109539" title="Lake Buena Vista, Florida">
<text>Lake Buena Vista ( or ) is a city in Orange County, Florida, United States. It is mostly known for being the mailing address for Walt Disney World, although almost all of the resort facilities, including all four theme parks, are physically located in the adjacent city of Bay Lake. It is one of two Florida municipalities inside the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, which also contains Walt Disney World, the other being Bay Lake. The permanent residential population of Lake Buena Vista was 24 at the 2020 census.

The city is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area, more commonly known as Greater Orlando or the Orlando metropolitan area.

==History==
Chapter 67-1965 of the Laws of Florida, incorporating the City of Reedy Creek, was signed into law by Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. on May 12, 1967, the same day he also signed chapters 67-764 (creating the Reedy Creek Improvement District), also known as the Reedy Creek Improvement Act, and 67-1104 (incorporating the city of Bay Lake). It was located fully inside the Reedy Creek Improvement District. The city was controlled by The Walt Disney Company and allowed it powers that other area attractions had not had.
Chapter 69-1527, which became law on July 3, 1969, without the governor&#x27;s approval, redefined the city boundaries. The city was completely moved, taking over some land that had been part of the City of Bay Lake (and was given up by Chapter 69-836, which became a law the same day) and including some other land that had formerly been unincorporated. Soon after, the City of Reedy Creek was renamed to the City of Lake Buena Vista to better reflect its new location, through which Reedy Creek did not flow. &quot;Buena Vista&quot; comes from the name of the street in Burbank, California, where The Walt Disney Company is headquartered.

The Reedy Creek Improvement District had all the powers of the city and more, raising the question of why cities needed to be incorporated inside it. Walt Disney&#x27;s original plans for the site were to construct a futuristic, fully-functional city; a planned &quot;community of the future&quot;. This was never built, but some of the ideas were incorporated into the EPCOT theme park and later Celebration, Florida. The only residents of the city are Disney employees and their immediate family members who live in a small community on Royal Oak Court, north of Disney Springs. From 1971 to 2022, the only landowners are fully owned subsidiaries of Disney, and rights-of-way for state and county roads.

On February 27, 2023, the Florida Legislature passed House Bill 9B to supersede the Reedy Creek Improvement Act, replacing the Reedy Creek Improvement District with the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District.

===The lake===
Lake Buena Vista is a small body of water located east of the Buena Vista Golf Course, west of the crossing of State Road 535 and Interstate 4. The lake, which was called &quot;Blake Lake&quot; before its acquisition by Disney, was named for Buena Vista Street in Burbank, California, where Disney&#x27;s corporate headquarters are located. Several Walt Disney Company business entities had names containing &quot;Buena Vista&quot;, a Spanish phrase that means &quot;good view&quot;.

In 2015, guide maps for the Disney Springs shopping, dining, and entertainment district started promoting Village Lake, which the district and Disney&#x27;s Saratoga Springs Resort &amp; Spa borders, as &quot;Lake Buena Vista&quot;. The actual lake and the promoted lake are connected via a stream, which is crossed by a bridge linking Disney Springs&#x27; Marketplace area with Saratoga Springs Resort.

<text>Maitland is a suburban city in Orange County, Florida, United States, part of the Greater Orlando area. The population was 19,543 at the 2020 census.

Waterhouse House Museum (all museums and the Maitland Art Center are now managed by Art &amp; History Museums of Maitland). A SunRail station is located in Maitland on Highway 17–92. The city is named for Fort Maitland.

==History==

Maitland is one of the oldest incorporated suburban municipalities in central Florida. The area was previously inhabited by Timucuan Native Americans. The town was originally named for a nearby Lake, which honored Captain William Seton Maitland, who fought in the Second Seminole Indian War, and was slain in the battle of Wahoo Swamp. A small military outpost was built in 1838 on the western shore of Lake Fumecheliga (later Lake Maitland) during the Second Seminole War. After the Civil War, new residents arrived in the area. Christopher Columbus Beasley, perhaps the first permanent settler, arrived at Lake Maitland in 1871. A post office opened on January 2 of the next year and operated in his home. Around this post office, a small town grew. In the closing decades of the nineteenth century the area was put into extensive citrus production.
Lake Maitland was incorporated as a town in 1885, the third such town in Orange County to do so. In its infancy, Lake Maitland was often characterized as a rural village, with streets lined with large oak trees planted by early town aldermen. However, the old town began to rapidly modernize as Orlando&#x27;s suburban sprawl reached the town in the mid-1920s.

During this period the town grew rapidly as new houses and roads were built. In 1959, Maitland was incorporated as a city.

Maitland is a suburb of Orlando. The town&#x27;s &quot;historical corridor&quot; encompasses old residences still standing and occupied in the Lake Lily-Lake Catherine area and extending through the central portion of the city. Examples of these century-old structures include the &quot;Church of the Good Shepherd&quot; (1883); the &quot;William H. Waterhouse House&quot; (1884); the Maitland Public Library (1907); and the &quot;Maitland Art Center&quot; (1937). The area has always been a vacation spot because of its climate, location to theme parks and people. Maitland has many picturesque parks along lakes, which attract many boaters.

It appeared that the village would become a town, incorporating in 1887. However, a fire in the business district and a subsequent period of freezes in rapid succession throughout the 1890s, along with the growth of nearby Winter Garden, seemed to ensure that Oakland would remain as little more than a sleepy village. In 1940, Oakland surpassed nearby Maitland in population, ranking at #6 in the county. In 1950, however, Oakland fell back to #7, with a population of 545, the majority of whom were Black.

<text>Ocoee () is a city in Orange County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. According to the 2020 US Census, the city had a population of 47,295.

==History==

===Founding and early history===
In the mid-1850s, Dr. J.D. Starke, stricken with malaria, took a group of slaves, similarly stricken, to the north side of an open pine wooded lake that provided clear and clean water to avoid further malaria outbreaks. The camp built by the group provided a base of operations from which to commute during the day to work the fields near Lake Apopka and rest at night. As the camp grew into a village, it took the name Starke Lake, a name the lake upon which the group settled bears to this day. The city&#x27;s population increased further after the American Civil War as Confederate soldiers and their families settled into the area, including Captain Bluford Sims and General William Temple Withers who wintered at the location. Captain Sims received a land grant for a 74-acre parcel to the west of Starke Lake in what is now the downtown portion of Ocoee on October 5, 1883. In 1886, Captain Sims, along with a group of original settlers, led an effort to have the town platted and changed the name to Ocoee, after a river he grew up near in Tennessee. &quot;Ocoee&quot; is a Cherokee Indian word anglicized from &quot;uwagahi&quot;, meaning &quot;apricot vine place&quot; and this inspired the choice of the city&#x27;s flower.

Bluford Sims began groundbreaking work in budding wild orange trees while in Ocoee. His commercial citrus nursery was the first in the United States in Ocoee, supplying many other groves in Florida with their first trees as well as shipping young citrus trees to California. The construction of the Florida Midland Railroad in the 1880s spurred growth in the area and many more settlers moved in.

===Ocoee massacre===

On November 2, 1920, after July Perry and Mose Norman, two Black men, attempted to vote and encouraged other Black people to vote, the entire Black population of the town was attacked by a mob organized by the Ku Klux Klan. On the night of the massacre, white World War I veterans from throughout Orange County murdered dozens of African-American residents. At least 24 Black homes were burned, the institutions constituting the Black community were destroyed, and Perry was lynched. Before the massacre, Ocoee&#x27;s Black population numbered approximately five hundred; after the massacre, however, the Black population was nearly eliminated. For more than 40 years, Ocoee remained an all-white sundown town. In 2018, the city commission issued a proclamation formally acknowledging the massacre and declaring that Ocoee is no longer a sundown town.

===Incorporation and modern history===
Ocoee was incorporated in 1922 (or 1923) and became a city in 1925.

Highway construction was the impetus for Ocoee&#x27;s growth in the 20th century. State Road 50 (SR 50) was constructed south of downtown Ocoee in 1959 and provided a direct east-west connection between the City and a growing Orlando. The development of what would become Florida State Road 50 made the town more accessible to housing developers. Florida&#x27;s Turnpike was opened just south of downtown Ocoee in 1964. In late 1990, Ocoee was connected to Orlando by a western extension of Florida State Road 408 (the East-West Expressway) which then joined the Florida&#x27;s Turnpike south of SR 50. In 2000, the completion of Florida State Road 429 (the Western Expressway) linked Ocoee with Walt Disney World to the south.

==History==
Initially settled in 1870, the town&#x27;s development has been shaped by that of Orlando, approximately to the north. From just before 1882 the South Florida Railroad mainline, which became part of the Plant System in 1893 and the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1902, provided regular rapid passenger and freight service. The town officially incorporated in 1925, but later reverted to unincorporated development. The population was 10,805 at the 2010 census. Passenger trains operated by successor Seaboard Coast Line A Line from 1967 then Amtrak after 1971 bypassed the local depot, with nearest stops in Orlando and Kissimmee. Passenger rail service returned with the opening of SunRail&#x27;s Sand Lake Road station in 2014.

==Industry==
The name &quot;Pine Castle&quot; has been associated with several industrial projects. In 1925, boat manufacturer Correct Craft founded its original factory in Pine Castle, before constructing a larger facility in 2006. In the mid-1940s, Bell Aircraft Corporation tested its X-1 supersonic rocket plane at Pinecastle Army Airfield, because of the area&#x27;s then-remote location and runway. The airfield, located southeast of Pine Castle, has since become Orlando International Airport.

==Education==
The Pine Castle Christian Academy won state championships in three high school sports.

<doc id="109553" wikidata="Q3294011" url="?curid=109553" title="Pine Hills, Florida">
<text>Pine Hills is a census-designated place (CDP) and unincorporated subdivision in Orange County, Florida, United States, west of Orlando. Per the 2020 U.S. Census, the population was 66,111. It is a part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area (home to 2,134,311 people in 2010).

Pine Hills is home to several parks, five elementary schools, two middle schools, and one high school. 

As a part of the Florida Coast To Coast Bicycle Trail, the Pine Hills Trail is also being developed running from Barnett Park through the middle of the community to Clarcona-Ocoee Road. 

As a result of residential demographic shifts, the area has been described as one of Central Florida&#x27;s most prominent minority-majority communities, showcasing a highly diverse cultural tapestry, featuring significant Haitian, Jamaican, Spanish, and Asian population centers. 

==History==

The area that would become Pine Hills began in 1953 with the first subdivisions – Robinswood and Pine Ridge Estates – constructed along the newly completed Pine Hills Road north of Colonial Drive (SR 50). It was one of the first suburbs of Orlando and grew as a bedroom community for the workers of Martin Marietta (now Lockheed Martin). At the time, it was an upper-middle class suburb with a country club named &quot;Silver Pines&quot;.

During the 1960s and into the 1970s, Pine Hills grew north from the original subdivisions around Pine Hills Rd and Colonial Drive to include new neighborhoods off of Silver Star Rd in the north around Powers Dr and to the east around Pine Hills and Indian Hill Roads. The community built its own fire department, a post office branch, and several schools. 

In the 1970s, the Orange County government seized Pine Hills&#x27; fire engine in an effort to consolidate county-wide fire services. Nevertheless, Pine Hills continued to grow and community leaders began an initiative to incorporate Pine Hills into a city. However, this initiative was eventually abandoned.

Several Orange County Commissioners and Florida State House of Representatives and Senators have lived and worked in Pine Hills. During the 1980s, the City of Orlando began annexing sections of Pine Hills. Some areas annexed during this time include North Lane east of Pine Hills Road, Clarion Drive south of Clarcona-Ocoee Road, and areas of the Signal Hill subdivision. Residents rejected further annexation, fearing larger taxes and little representation from Orlando. Eventually, as Orlando&#x27;s growth surrounded Pine Hills, many of the original families moved into newer neighborhoods in nearby Ocoee, Winter Garden and MetroWest.

Into the late 1980s and during the 1990s, Pine Hills fell into a state of decline. Silver Pines Country Club was closed, and apartment complexes were built on the property in the mid-1990s. The &quot;Pine Hills Shopping Center&quot; lost its long-time tenants and was eventually converted in the late 1990s into &quot;Pine Hills Marketplace&quot;, a strip mall with discount stores. 
As newer neighborhoods developed offering more housing options, rental rates dropped and housing became more affordable for residents. Paired with the long-term effects of post-desegregation white flight, neglect from the Orange County government, particularly from the Orange County Board of Commissioners, has resulted in higher crime, and the perpetuation of the &quot;&#x27;Crime Hills&#x27; narrative&#x27;&quot; that the area is a less safe, or desirable place to live. As of 2013, Pine Hills&#x27; perception as a high-crime area has begun to shift in a positive direction, by virtue of community-wide initiatives and efforts led by residents. Many schools and churches offer after-school programs and to some extent, free daycare. The Orlando Police Department has collaborated with the Orange County Sheriff&#x27;s Office to prevent crime by increasing patrols through the neighborhoods. The government of Orange County is also increasing code enforcement and issuing citations to property owners who neglect to maintain their home&#x27;s appearance.

Recent developments in Pine Hills included the reconstruction of Evans High School main campus on Silver Star Road; completed in 2012. 

Reconstruction with the latest technology was also completed at Meadowbrook Middle, Robinswood Middle, Pine Hills, Rolling Hills, and Mollie E. Ray Elementary Schools. Additional development includes Orlando&#x27;s newest &quot;Chinatown&quot;, located along west Colonial Drive across from the Pine Hills Marketplace. West Colonial Drive, one of the main highways in Pine Hills, was redesigned and construction completed in 2011, bringing better traffic management and improved landscaping to Pine Hills. Other traffic improvement initiatives in Pine Hills included repaving and redesigning the intersection of Pine Hills and Silver Star Roads. Future initiatives include the expansion of Pine Hills Road south to LB Mcleod Road. Lynx, the local transportation agency, is constructing a SuperStop transit connection for multiple bus routes to provide easy access for workers.

==Neighborhood revitalization==

The most recent effort to revitalize Pine Hills began with the creation of the &quot;Pine Hills Safe Neighborhood Partnership&quot;. It is a group of neighborhood residents who collaborate with the Orange County Government and local law enforcement agencies in an effort to keep the area safe. The group is a 501c3 non-profit organization and has received grant funding from private and public resources. The grants fund a variety of projects designed to deter crime and enhance resident safety. Some initiatives include hiring off-duty law enforcement officers to make extra patrols, offering summer youth programs to keep youth engaged, and helping neighborhoods make infrastructure improvements to traffic patterns, community lighting, and more. Regular community meetings are held at the Pine Hills Community Center.

In 2004, the Pine Hills Community Council, Inc. commissioned the &quot;Pine Hills Land Analysis and Strategic Plan&quot;, which outlined a vision for revitalization and economic growth supported by residents. Since this study was released, the neighborhood has continued to focus on revitalization initiatives by holding community forums, establishing partnerships with private developers and public agencies. It also engages property owners and renters in protecting the area&#x27;s quality of life. As a result of the community partnerships and focus on crime prevention, the sheriff&#x27;s office has reported downward crime trends in this area. 

Additionally, in October 2009, Mayor Richard Crotty established the Pine Hills Business Redevelopment Task Force. This 13-member advisory committee was created to assist with the economic revitalization of the area.

==Diversity==

Pine Hills is one of the most ethnically diverse regions of the Greater Orlando metropolitan area and is a minority majority community. The populations of African-Americans and Hispanics are reported to be significantly above the state of Florida&#x27;s average. The foreign-born population is also above the state average. There are large Caribbean populations of Haitians, Jamaicans, and Puerto Ricans. There is also a large Asian population of Vietnamese, Koreans, and Cambodians. This diversity is evident along Pine Hills Road where many immigration offices, Caribbean and Asian restaurants, and West Indian grocery stores abound.

Several flourishing neighborhoods exist where the median family income exceeds the area average. Subdivisions close to Pine Hills with expensive single-family homes are found in the nearby Rosemont neighborhood, which was the first planned development created within the City of Orlando. Expensive homes are also located off Balboa Drive near Good Homes Road in the Rose Hill subdivision and along north Powers Drive. A near-replica of Elvis Presley&#x27;s Graceland Mansion, constructed in 1981, is located off North Hiawassee Road in the Hyland Oaks subdivision.

In 2010, Evans High School became the first UCF-Certified Community Partnership School in the state of Florida, established through a collaboration between the Children&#x27;s Home Society of Florida, Orange County Public Schools, and the University of Central Florida. Since Evans became a Community Partnership School, student test scores and other metrics have significantly increased, Ellis says. Especially notable: Evans’ graduation rate has improved from 64 percent in the 2010–2011 school year (when CPS efforts began) to 87 percent in the 2016–2017 school year. Prior to becoming a Community Partnership School, Evans was labeled a “dropout factory” by Johns Hopkins University.

==&quot;Crime Hills Narrative&quot;==
Into the late 1990s and early 2000s, Pine Hills&#x27; worsening economic decline resulted in the increasingly negative public perception of the area in local media, and public discourse.

In recent years, this pattern of unfavorable media coverage of Pine Hills has resulted in passionate discourse regarding the true causes and nature of the current state of the area, exacerbated by the generational divide of residents that lived in Pine Hills during its most economically prosperous time, and more recent generations of residents. 

Negative psychological impacts of this online discourse, manifest tangibly in a significant decrease in homeownership, and the increase of non-residential property ownership in Pine Hills, Florida. 

In most cases, former residents, and their descendants, react to unfavorable coverage with backlash, echoing negative stereotypes and discrediting successes of community-led efforts to address poverty-related crimes, and general insecurity. This phenomenon has since been coined, &quot;The Crime Hills narrative&quot; by Pine Hills Partnership Inc., a local 501(c)3 organization dedicated to the area.

In October 2020, local news reports indicated the area suffered a six-month gang war that had killed five people, including a three-year-old child. Although, the same period in question saw a significant spike in violent crimes, and notable shootings, across Orange County, and Greater Orlando.

By 2013, he had donated about $10 million to the community. Speaking in 2015, the sheriff of Orange County described Tangelo Park as &quot;a changed neighborhood&quot;, with a significant reduction in violent crime. Rosen recalled his first visit to an elementary school class in Tangelo Park at the start of the project, where only two or three children expressed a desire to go on to college, to which Rosen said &quot;That has to change.&quot; When he returned and asked the same question a year later, &quot;every hand went up&quot;.

== History ==
=== Timeline ===

==== Mid 1870s ====
Dudley W. Adams arrives at what is known as the &quot;Olaville&quot; settlement in Northwest Orange County, Florida.

==== 1879 ====
During a neighborhood meeting at the home of Miss Bessie Heustis, sister-in-law of Mr. Adams, the name of Olaville is changed to Tangerine, the group being inspired by the fruit of the tree that grew by her doorstep.

==== 1886-1887 ====
The Congregational Church is founded as the Union Church of Christ in Tangerine. Shortly thereafter, the name is changed to the Congregational Church of Christ and a church building is constructed. In the 1940s, the church is named Tangerine Community Church.

==== April 3, 1909 ====
The Tangerine Improvement Society (TIS) is founded by local Tangerine women. Men are later admitted in 1920.

==== 1911 ====
Mr. and Mrs. William H. and Addie G. Earl donate land to TIS for a community building – “Tangerine Community Hall.”

==== April 5, 1912 ====
The Tangerine Community Hall opens its doors to community use.

==== 1920s ====
Mrs. Sadie Trimble gifts Trimble Park, situated between Lakes Beauclaire and Carlton, to Orange County.

==== 1937 ====
Land later to become Tangerine Park is conveyed to the Tangerine Improvement Society.

==== May 28, 1972 ====
The Tangerine Community Hall catches fire. The nearby Zellwood, Florida fire department responds within seven minutes, but the building is destroyed.

==== April 18, 1977 ====
A new TIS building at 7101 Wright Ave. is dedicated as Johnston Hall in honor of Cecil “CeCe” Johnston for his dedication and service to Tangerine. When the original TIS building burned in 1972, Mr. Johnston led the drive for funds to erect the new building.

== Notable residents ==
Tangerine was the adopted home of novelist, journalist and government consultant Harry Hart Frank (born Chicago, Illinois, 1908; died Jacksonville, Florida, 1964). Under the pen name Pat Frank, his classic 1959 post-apocalyptic novel &quot;Alas, Babylon&quot; is set in the fictional Central Florida small town (stated pop. 3,500) of &quot;Fort Repose&quot;. Fort Repose, although fictional, is a clearly drawn composite, representative of many small isolated native-settler Florida communities of the period. The actual town of Mount Dora, north of Tangerine, has been stated as a specific inspiration for Fort Repose, with Frank&#x27;s fictional shantytown &quot;Pistolville&quot; said to have been named for Mt. Dora&#x27;s area of the same name.

== In popular culture ==
The setting for the popular young adult novel &quot;Tangerine&quot; by Edward Bloor is a fictional town based in Tangerine, Florida, located in the Orlando area and having no relation to the actual Tangerine, Florida.

Tangerine is indicated as the hiding place of former bank robber Doug MacRay in &quot;The Town&quot;.

This was met with extensive debate from town residents and an objection from Orange County, which stood to lose millions of dollars of property tax revenue.

Police services are provided by the Windermere Police Department. In January 2014, the department&#x27;s former chief, Daniel Saylor, was sentenced to eight years in prison for perjury. He had lied to the court in order to protect a friend who was found guilty of raping children and sentenced to life in prison. Saylor had pleaded guilty to other charges in 2011, earning him a year in jail.

Fire rescue and emergency medical services are provided by the Ocoee Fire Department. Postal services are provided by the Windermere Post Office. The Floridan Aquifer is Windermere and Orange County&#x27;s source of drinking and fire hydrant water, which is filtered naturally through hundreds of feet of sand and rock, and then treated by the Orange County Water Division.

==Education==
The community is within Orange County Public Schools (OCPS). Residents of the city itself are served by Windermere Elementary School, Gotha Middle School, and Olympia High School.

Windermere Preparatory School, a private, coeducational PK–12 college preparatory school, is in nearby Lake Butler.

The town of Windermere is not within the attendance boundaries of Windermere High School, a Lake Butler high school which opened in 2017. The Windermere town council opposed the naming on the grounds that area residents may mistakenly confuse the school with Windermere Preparatory. Some OCPS board members also argued the school should not be named for a community it will not be located in; they stated that not very many students from the town of Windermere will go to Windermere High.

==Transportation==

Windermere is located on an isthmus between several lakes in the Lake Butler chain. As such, it is on the shortest road route between the east and west sides of the chain. In fact, the next crossing to the south is distant at Lake Buena Vista, where County Road 535 (CR 535) and Apopka-Vineland Road meet. The next crossing to the north is at Gotha, the north end of the chain of lakes, away. 2003 Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT), much of which is commuters passing through, is 17,197 vehicles per day for Sixth Avenue (the east entrance), 18,362 on Main Street north of Sixth Avenue, and 9,484 on Main Street south of Sixth Avenue.

Windermere regulates traffic and encourages traffic to use alternate routes. In 2004, two roundabouts were installed downtown with the largest public works project in the town&#x27;s history. This has greatly improved traffic flow and relieved cut through traffic. A third roundabout was completed in August 2010 at the intersection of Park Avenue and Maguire Road. This is at the Windermere Elementary School intersection. All roads in the downtown area (laid out in a grid) are dirt roads except for a few through roads:
*Main Street from the northern boundary (as Maguire Road, which heads north to Ocoee) south to 12th Street; the pavement turns west at 12th Street onto Chase Road, which connects to CR 535
*Sixth Avenue east from Main Street to the town line, where it becomes Conroy-Windermere Road
*Second Avenue west from Main Street (serves a peninsula)
*&quot;Dirt Main Street&quot;, just west of Main Street (opposite where the railroad used to run), from Third Avenue to Seventh Avenue
*Several other paved roads exist in the outskirts, in areas that have been annexed since the original town was formed.

Until the 1980s, Main Street north of Sixth Avenue and Sixth Avenue east of Main Street were maintained by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) as part of State Road 439. This was given to Orange County as County Road 439 (CR 439), and Orange County eventually removed all signs and gave the part inside Windermere to the town. Signs put up by FDOT still mark the north end of CR 439 at SR 50, but no other signs exist, in part because Orange County has a general policy of not signing county roads.

The Florida Midland Railroad, part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, used to run just west of Main Street; there is now a large grassy area between Main Street and the dirt road (often called &quot;Dirt Main Street&quot;) that ran just west of the railroad. Windermere had a station on the railroad.

<text>Winter Garden is a city in western Orange County, Florida, United States. Located west of Downtown Orlando, it is part of the Orlando metropolitan area. The population was 46,964 as of the 2020 census.

==History==
The pre-European history of the modern Winter Garden area is ambiguous. Due to a lack of evidence, historians hesitate to conclude if the natives that once occupied the area were of the Timucua, Jororo, or Mayaca tribes. Regardless of their tribal identity, these natives were either wiped out or subsumed into larger cultures by the end of the eighteenth century.

Following the eradication of the original Floridian cultures, natives from farther north migrated into Florida. These natives had various cultures that over time coalesced into the Seminole Tribe. By the early 19th century, some Seminole lived on the south shore of Lake Apopka. The settlement possibly produced the significant Seminole leader Wild Cat. In 1835, the Second Seminole War began, threatening the Seminole presence. On January 23, 1837, a small battle was fought near the village. Thomas S. Jesup, at that time in command of all American forces in Florida, sent a detachment to Lake Apopka to seek a Seminole chief known as Osuchee or &quot;Copper&quot;. During the attack, the army successfully killed Osuchee and three other Seminoles, while taking 17 prisoners. The Second and Third Seminole wars both pushed the Seminole tribe south, likely eliminating their presence in the boundaries of modern Winter Garden.

The first American settlers came to what is now Winter Garden in the 1850s. The Roper, Reams, Dunaway, Speer, and Starke families were among the first to settle the area. As with most American pioneers, they engaged in agriculture as a primary economic activity. These farms mainly grew sugar cane and vegetables, and early on a small number utilized slave labor. During The Civil War steamboat traffic stopped along the St. Johns River, forcing Winter Garden families to subsist off their own crops.
The arrival of the Orange Belt Railroad and the growing production of citrus, turpentine, and lumber drove the town&#x27;s growth over the remaining decades of the 19th century and into the 20th. Stores and businesses cropped up along Plant Street, originating Downtown Winter Garden. A settler from Mississippi named A. B. Newton contributed to the town&#x27;s early economy. He opened one of the first stores, served as the first postmaster, founded the first newspaper, and functioned as the first mayor. These endeavors earned him the title &quot;The Godfather of Winter Garden&quot;.

Between the 1920s and 1960s, the fishing prospects of Lake Apopka drew many fishermen to Winter Garden. The still-operating Edgewater Hotel in Downtown Winter Garden opened to service fishermen during the fishing boom. However, by the end of the 1960s, heavy pollution of Lake Apopka resulted in the collapse of the industry.

Citrus agriculture saw rapid growth in the state of Florida in the last few decades of the 19th century, including in Winter Garden. As with the rest of the state, the Great Freeze of 1894–1895 severely damaged the citrus industry in Winter Garden. Many settlers left following this disaster, leaving a smaller population to recover the area&#x27;s farms. Despite this setback, the industry recovered and saw many decades of growth. Through the middle stretch of the 20th century citrus defined Winter Garden&#x27;s economy and culture.

In the 1980s, back-to-back freezes reduced the profitability of citrus farming in the county. Citrus production in Winter Garden and Orange County never recovered. Since then, the center of citrus production in Florida has shifted south from Orange County. The increasing development of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford Metropolitan Area made it more profitable to sell grove lands to developers rather than attempt to restart them. Today, little citrus activity occurs in the city limits of Winter Garden. Yet, the town is proud of its citrus history; oranges and grapefruits continue to be symbols of the town.

Since 2000, Winter Garden has seen growth despite the decline of citrus and the economic stagnation in the 1980s and 1990s. Developers, entrepreneurs, and city government made efforts to rejuvenate the downtown district, attracting locals and tourists with a mix of small-town atmosphere and trendy businesses. This population and development growth endured through the Great Recession and continues today.

To the south, Winter Garden Village provides an array of chain retail and dining establishments. The open-air shopping center, located along Daniels Road just north of SR 429, is anchored by a Super Target, a Best Buy, and a Lowe&#x27;s.

Downtown Winter Garden hosts a farmer&#x27;s market every weekend. Many vendors sell fresh produce, plants, and flowers, herbs, baked goods, artisan crafts, and local food and beverages. Live music is also a feature of the market.

==Transportation==

State Road 50 (W. Colonial Dr) bisects the city into northern and southern sections. The portion south of State Road 50, formerly occupied by orange groves and farmland, has recently been the site of the development of numerous large-scale communities, including Johns Lake Pointe, Stoneybrook West, Stonecrest, Westfield, and Wintermere Pointe.

The toll road Western Beltway (SR 429) was completed in late 2006 and links I-4 near mile marker 58 in Osceola County with Florida&#x27;s Turnpike at Winter Garden. Other major roads through Winter Garden include County Road 535 and County Road 545. CR 535 (also called Winter Garden – Vineland Road) begins at SR 50 and bisects the southern half of the city, proceeding south to Windermere, Lake Buena Vista and Walt Disney World Resort, where it becomes State Road 535. CR 545 (also called Avalon Road) begins at SR 50 and proceeds south along the western edge of Winter Garden and along the border between Orange and Lake counties. This area remains mostly rural but is quickly developing because of the nearby toll road. CR 545 currently ends at US 192 in Kissimmee at the border to Osceola County.

<text>Winter Park is a city in Orange County, Florida, United States. The population was 29,795 according to the 2020 census. It is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Winter Park was founded as a resort community by northern business magnates in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Its main street, called Park Avenue, is located in the middle of town. It includes civic buildings, retail, art galleries, a private liberal arts college (Rollins College), museums, a park, a train station, a golf course country club, a historic cemetery, and a beach and boat launch.

==History==

The Winter Park area&#x27;s first human residents were migrant Muscogee people who had earlier intermingled with the Choctaw and other indigenous people. In a process of ethnogenesis, the Native Americans formed a new culture which they called &quot;Seminole&quot;, a derivative of the Mvskoke&#x27; (a Creek language) word simano-li, an adaptation of the Spanish cimarrón which means &quot;wild&quot; (in their case, &quot;wild men&quot;), or &quot;runaway&quot; [men]. The site was first inhabited by Europeans in 1858, when David Mizell Jr. bought an 8-acre (32,000 m2) homestead between Lakes Virginia, Mizell, and Berry. A settlement, called &quot;Lake View&quot; by the inhabitants, grew up around Mizell&#x27;s plot. It got a post office and a new name—&quot;Osceola&quot;—in 1870.

The area did not develop rapidly until 1880, when a South Florida Railroad track connecting Orlando and Sanford was laid a few miles west of Osceola. Shortly afterwards, Loring Chase came to Orange County from Chicago to recuperate from a lung disease. In his travels, he discovered the pretty group of lakes just east of the railbed. He enlisted a wealthy New Englander, Oliver E. Chapman, and they assembled a very large tract of land for $13,000 on July 4, 1881. They planned the town of Winter Park on this piece of land. Over the next four years they plotted the town, opened streets, built a town hall and a store, planted orange trees, and required all buildings to meet stylistic and architectural standards. Winter Park was a heavily planned city, something that is still evident in its streets’ grid-like organization. The town was then promoted heavily, especially to snow birds in the north looking for a place to hibernate in the winter. During this founding time, the Winter Park Post Office opened, and the railroad constructed a depot, connected to Osceola by a dirt road.
In 1885, a group of businessmen started the Winter Park Company and incorporated it with the Florida Legislature; Chase and Chapman sold the town to the new company. In a land bubble characteristic of Florida history, land prices soared from less than $2 per acre to over $200, with at least one sale recorded at $300 per acre. This land bubble concept would never go away, with towns and counties directly surrounding the area with exponentially cheaper land prices.

In 1885, the Congregational Assembly of Florida started Rollins College, the state&#x27;s first four-year college. Rollins College today remains one of the hallmarks of Winter Park, an integral part of Winter Park&#x27;s history and culture. It is the second most expensive college in the state, as of the 2023-2024 academic year the tuition at Rollins is $58,300 per year. Rollins is a relatively good liberal arts school, with a smaller student population, counted as roughly just over 2,000 students. The school also features an MBA program, at the Crummer Graduate School of Business. Back in 1886, the Seminole Hotel on Lake Osceola opened. This was a resort complete with the luxuries of the day: gas lights, steam heating, a string orchestra, a formal dining room, a bowling alley, and long covered porches. This street is now a cul de sac called Kiwi Circle that is part of one of the nicest neighborhoods in the town. On October 21, 1887, it was officially incorporated as the &quot;Town of Winter Park&quot;, and in 1925, reincorporated as the &quot;City of Winter Park&quot;.

===Presidential visits===
The first president to visit was Chester A. Arthur, who reported that Winter Park was &quot;the prettiest place I have seen in Florida&quot;. President Grover Cleveland visited the area and was given a huge reception at the Seminole Hotel on February 23, 1888. He enjoyed the Bounding Horse Cart ride and stated that it was the most pleasant diversion of his Florida trip. The New York Times reported on his visit that &quot;The Philadelphian and Bostonian founders had done a good job with the town.&quot;

The following four years both hotel and the town became a fashionable winter resort for northern visitors. The next president to visit the area was Franklin D. Roosevelt in March 1936. He was conferred an honorary degree in literature at Rollins College.

President Barack Obama visited Rollins College on August 2, 2012, to give a speech that was part of his re-election campaign. An interesting note on recent Presidential elections is that Orange County, the county Winter Park is in, was one of the bluest counties in Florida. Although Winter Park is a large mix of both conservative and liberal constituents. However, this mix is evident in US Congressional District 7&#x27;s last two representatives. Former Republican Congressman John Mica lost reelection in 2016 to newcomer and Democrat Stephanie Murphy. Both have had a lot of support from both sides of the aisle and Murphy is credited with being one of the most centrist representatives in Congress today.

===Winter Park Public Library===
The Winter Park Public Library was historically located at 460 E. New England Avenue in the heart of Winter Park. Its origins date back to 1885, when nine women organized to create a lending library for their small community, which was still in its infancy at the time. The Winter Park Public Library underwent major changes and moved to a new site. It opened in late 2021 on a new world-class campus designed by world-renowned architect Sir David Adjaye.

===Peacocks===
In 1904, Charles Hosmer Morse became the biggest landowner in Winter Park. His patronage continued in the 1920s, when he purchased a 200-acre parcel between lakes Virginia, Berry, and Mizell. In 1945, Morse&#x27;s granddaughter Jeannette and her husband Hugh McKean moved to the land, and soon after they added peacocks. Now, the land is a nature preserve that houses an orange grove and over 30 peacocks. Winter Park locals consider the peacock to be a pet to the entire community. The peacock is on the official Winter Park seal, is featured in a number of official city documents, and is protected by the community. Peacocks often roam around in neighborhoods, especially throughout the community of Windsong, where residents are often seen taking care of them.

===The Winter Park Sinkhole ===

In 1972, Henry Swanson, an agricultural agent and &quot;resident layman expert on Central Florida water,&quot; wrote a letter to the editor warning Orange County mayors of the sinkhole danger that could be posed by overdevelopment and excessive groundwater use. Swanson predicted that the west Winter Park area would be especially at risk. In May 1981, during a period of record-low water levels in Florida&#x27;s limestone aquifer, a massive sinkhole opened near the corner of Denning Drive and Fairbanks Avenue.

The sinkhole first appeared on the evening of May 8, 1981, near the house of Winter Park resident Mae Rose Williams. Within a few hours, a 40-year-old sycamore tree near her house had fallen into the sinkhole. The next morning, the hole expanded to nearly wide. In a story in the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;, she said that as the sun rose, she heard a noise &quot;like giant beavers chewing&quot; as the hole began to devour more of her land. The hole was collapsing rapidly. By noon, as she realized that her home was slipping into the expanding hole, she and the family evacuated and removed their belongings. That afternoon her house fell into the sinkhole, and within a few hours the house was irrevocably on its way into the sinkhole&#x27;s center, headed to unknown depths.

The hole eventually widened to and to a depth of . The following fell into the sinkhole: five Porsches at a repair shop, a pickup truck with camper top, the Winter Park municipal pool, and large portions of Denning Drive. By May 9, nearly of earth had fallen into the sinkhole. Damage was estimated at $2 million to $4 million. On May 9, 1981, the sinkhole grew to a record size, gulping down 250,000 cubic yards of soil and taking with it the deep end of an Olympic-size swimming pool, chunks of two streets and Williams&#x27; three-bedroom home and yard. Florida engineers have described the event as &quot;the largest sinkhole event witnessed by man as a result of natural geological reasons or conditions.&quot; They based their statements on his study of 2,000 sinkholes over more than 40 years. That opinion was echoed by Ardaman &amp; Associates, a local engineering consulting firm.

The sinkhole drew national attention and became a popular tourist attraction during the summer of 1981. A carnival-like atmosphere arose around the area, with vendors selling food, balloons, and T-shirts to visitors. The city of Winter Park sold sinkhole photographs for promotional and educational purposes. On July 9, 1981, Winter Park began selling sinkhole photographs to educate the community about sinkholes and to promote tourism. The sinkhole began to fill with water that summer, but on July 19, the water level suddenly dropped by a reported .

As the novelty wore off, the city worked to repair the damage. Workers were able to recover four of the six vehicles that fell into the sinkhole, including the travel trailer, whose owner drove it away, and three of the five Porsches. The other two remain at the bottom of the lake with Mae Rose Owens&#x27; home. Engineers filled in the bottom with dirt and concrete. Diver reports from 2009 suggest that the lake has since been used to dispose of unwanted vehicles. Besides a 1987 incident in which the bottom of the lake suddenly dropped , causing erosion on the southern rim, the stabilized sinkhole has been generally quiet.

===The Langford Resort Hotel===
The Langford Hotel served as a gateway to &quot;Old Florida&quot; attractions in Central Florida and a community social hub for decades.

Famous guests included Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, Larry King, Hugh Hefner, John Denver, Langford winter resident Lady Bird Johnson, and President Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy Reagan, who celebrated their 24th wedding anniversary there. Reagan gave a campaign speech at Rollins College and stayed at the Langford in 1976.

The Langford was celebrated in a party in late 1999, closed, and was demolished. A portion of the former Langford property (as of mid-2009) has been developed into luxury mid-rise condominiums. The remaining parcel was redeveloped and in 2014, a boutique hotel named the Alfond Inn, owned and operated by Rollins College opened at the site of the original Langford Hotel. The Alfond Inn was built with a $12.5 million grant from the Harold Alfond Foundation. Net operating income from the Inn is directed to The Alfond Scholars program fund, the College&#x27;s premier scholarship fund.

===The Temple Grove===
An orange grove, known as the Temple Grove, stood on the south side of Palmer Avenue just east of Temple Drive. The temple orange was grown on the old Wyeth grove on Palmer Avenue (later Temple Grove) owned at the time by Louis A. Hakes, whose son was the first to notify Temple of the different quality of the new orange. The orange was introduced and cataloged by Buckeye Nursery in 1917, the year W. C. Temple died. Myron E. Gillett and his son D. Collins Gillett later went on to plant the largest orange grove in the world in the 1920s () in Temple Terrace, Florida.

===The Winter Park Sidewalk Art Festival===
The Winter Park Sidewalk Art Festival is one of the nation&#x27;s oldest, largest juried outdoor art festivals, rated among the top shows by &quot;Sunshine Artist&quot; and &quot;American Style&quot; magazines. In 2012, about 1,200 artists from around the world applied for entry, and an independent panel of judges selected 225 national and international artists to attend the show. The National Endowment for the Arts, the White House, Congress, and many others have lauded the Festival for promoting art and art education in Central Florida. An all-volunteer board of directors runs the annual festival.

The city is traversed by the old East Florida and Atlantic Railroad (&quot;Dinky Line&quot;) railroad bed, which until the 1960s had a stop at Lake Virginia/Rollins College at the city park now known as Dinky Dock. Much of this right of way has been converted to a rail-trail pedestrian/biking path in the form of the Cady Way Trail, which leads from Cady Way Park toward the Baldwin Park neighborhood and downtown Orlando, and in the opposite direction to Oviedo and beyond (via the Florida Trail), due to a new pedestrian bridge spanning Semoran Boulevard (SR 436) in Orange County.

SunRail operates a rail line through Winter Park on the former Atlantic Coast Line, with an Amtrak and SunRail commuter rail station in downtown&#x27;s historic Central Park.

<doc id="109569" wikidata="Q583894" url="?curid=109569" title="Kissimmee, Florida">
<text>Kissimmee ( ) is the largest city and county seat of Osceola County, Florida, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 79,226. It is a Principal City of the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, Florida, Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had a 2020 population of 2,673,376. The Census Bureau defines an urban area with Kissimmee as the principal city, which is separated from the Orlando urban area. The Kissimmee–St. Cloud, FL urban area had a 2020 population of 418,404, making it the 100th largest in the United States.

== History ==
The area was originally named Allendale, after Confederate Major J. H. Allen, who operated the first cargo steamboat along the Kissimmee River—the &quot;Mary Belle&quot;. It was renamed Kissimmee when incorporated as a city in 1883. The modern town, the county seat of Osceola County, was founded before the Civil War by the Bass, Johnson and Overstreet families. The etymology of the name Kissimmee is debated, apart from general agreement that it is Native American in origin. Its growth can be credited to Hamilton Disston of Philadelphia, who based his four-million acre (8,000 km2) drainage operation out of the town. Disston had contracted with the financially wobbly state of Florida to drain its southern lands, for which he would own half of all he successfully drained. This deal made Disston the largest single landowner in the United States.

Disston&#x27;s dredging and land speculation required a small steamboat industry to transport people and goods along the new waterway. The Kissimmee shipyard was responsible for building most of these large steamships, which were just one jump ahead of civilization—with Kissimmee as the jumping off point. Concurrently, the South Florida Railroad was growing and extended the end of its line from Sanford down to Kissimmee, making the town on Lake Tohopekaliga a transportation hub for Central Florida. On February 12, 1885, the Florida Legislature incorporated the Kissimmee City Street Railway.

But Kissimmee&#x27;s heyday was short-lived. Expanding railroads began to challenge the steamships for carrying freight and passengers. By 1884, the South Florida Railroad, now part of the Plant System, had extended its tracks to Tampa. The Panic of 1893 was the worst depression the U.S. had experienced up to that time, crushing land speculation and unsound debt. Disston closed his Kissimmee land operation. Consecutive freezes in 1894 and 1895 wiped out the citrus industry. The freezes, combined with South Florida&#x27;s growth and the relocation of steamship operations to Lake Okeechobee, left Kissimmee dependent on open range cattle ranching.

Kissimmee had a population of 4,310 in 1950. At that point, there was some citrus packing as well as ranching.

Ranching remained an important part of the local economy until Walt Disney World opened nearby in 1971. After that, tourism and development supplanted cattle ranching to a large measure. But even though the Disney facility took over much of the open range cattle lands, cattle ranches still operate nearby, particularly in southern Osceola County.

The 1998 Kissimmee tornado outbreak killed dozens of people in the area. On August 13, 2004, Hurricane Charley passed through Kissimmee with winds in excess of , damaging homes and buildings, toppling trees and cutting electrical power to the entire city. Kissimmee Utility Authority restored power to 54 percent of the residents in the first 72 hours and to 85 percent within one week. Service was restored to all customers on August 28. Three weeks after Hurricane Charley, the area was struck by Hurricane Frances, then Hurricane Jeanne three weeks later.

<text>St. Cloud or Saint Cloud is a city in northern Osceola County, Florida, United States. It is on the southern shore of East Lake Tohopekaliga in Central Florida, about southeast of Orlando. The population was 35,183 in the 2010 census, and 58,964 in the 2020 census. The city is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford metropolitan area.

St. Cloud was founded as a retirement community for Civil War union veterans, and gained the nickname &quot;The Friendly Soldier City&quot;.

==History==
During the 1870s, Hamilton Disston of Philadelphia took an interest in developing the region while on fishing trips with Henry Shelton Sanford, founder of the city of Sanford. Disston contracted with the Florida Internal Improvement Fund, then in receivership, to pay $1 million to offset its Civil War and Reconstruction debt. In exchange, Disston was awarded half the land he drained from the state&#x27;s swamps. He dug canals and, in 1886–1887, established St. Cloud sugarcane plantation, named after St. Cloud, Minnesota, although many longtime locals claim the town was named after Saint-Cloud, France.

Disston opened the Sugar Belt Railway to the South Florida Railroad in 1888 to carry his product to market. But the Panic of 1893 dropped land values, and the Great Freeze of 1894–1895 ruined the plantation. Disston returned to Philadelphia, where he died in 1896. The Sugar Belt Railway merged into the South Florida Railroad. An attempt to cultivate rice in the area failed, and for several years the land remained fallow. Then in 1909, the Seminole Land &amp; Investment Company acquired as the site for a Grand Army of the Republic veterans&#x27; colony. St. Cloud was selected because of its &quot;health, climate and productiveness of soil.&quot; It was first permanently settled in 1909 by William G. King, a real estate manager from Alachua County who had been given the responsibility &quot;to plan, locate and develop a town.&quot;

On April 16, 1909, the &quot;Kissimmee Valley Gazette&quot; announced the &quot;New Town of St. Cloud&quot;, a &quot;Soldiers Colony&quot; near Kissimmee. The newspaper called the Seminole Land and Investment Company&#x27;s purchase &quot;one of the most important real estate deals ever made in the State of Florida.&quot; It was reported that the company had searched all over Florida for the perfect site for a veterans&#x27; colony, particularly one suited for &quot;health, climate, and productiveness of the soil&quot;. It is believed that many of the streets were named for states from which the Civil War veterans had served, but the street names were already assigned to the platted land before settlement occurred.

Early St. Cloud is believed to have history as a Sundown Town with a plot of land outside the city reserved for black residents officially dubbed “Colored Quarter.” This name is still active on official land records as the title of this section of land. Early newspaper records support the history of being a “Sundown Town” with firsthand accounts of local residents making attempts “to keep the colored folks in their own quarters outside the town.”

On June 1, 1915, the Florida Legislature incorporated St. Cloud as a city. Its downtown features landmark buildings by the Orlando architectural firm Ryan &amp; Roberts, a partnership consisting of two women. The buildings by Ryan and Roberts and others downtown are predominantly Spanish Revival.

St. Cloud has tried to separate itself from neighboring cities, and particularly the theme parks, by promoting an image of small-town life, and by attempting to make itself economically less dependent on Kissimmee. On March 6, 2006, St. Cloud introduced the CyberSpot program, becoming the first city in the United States to give residents free high-speed wireless Internet access, but the program ended in 2009.

===Water tower cross controversy===
In the late 1960s, the city of St. Cloud was gifted a Latin cross during the Christmas season. The twelve-foot tall cross, which was illuminated at night, stood atop the city’s water tower off U.S. Route 192 for nearly twenty years without issue.

By November 1986, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed its first lawsuit against the city of St. Cloud to have the cross removed. Four months later, in March 1987, private citizen Ronald Mendelson filed a similar lawsuit that the cross violated the U.S. Constitution’s mandate of separation of church and state. Mendelson, a Jewish resident who lived east of St. Cloud, decided to sue because of the city’s implicit endorsement of Christianity atop the water tower and the inconvenience Mendelson felt due to the “shadow of the cross.” In defense of its presence, residents cited the cross as a local landmark and directional marker for boaters, drivers, and pilots commuting within St. Cloud.

On August 16, 1989, a U.S. District judge ruled in favor of Mendelson to have the Latin cross removed off the water tower. The judge, however, suggested in his ruling that the city replace the Latin cross with a Greek cross, distinguished for representing a plus-sign, to identify St. Cloud as a crossroad city. The ACLU quickly filed an additional lawsuit, claiming that the new Greek cross still violated the U.S. Constitution in an attempt to evade the judge’s original ruling.

Eventually, the city of St. Cloud agreed to remove the cross in 1990, primarily due to the mounting legal costs incurred by the ACLU. Local support through the city council to reinstate the Latin cross on private property within St. Cloud was proposed. Ultimately, those discussions fell through due to the 35-foot height restriction that the cross would have exceeded on a structure within city limits.

The original Latin cross has since been moved atop a 60-foot tower on private property in nearby Intercession City, where it has remained since 1995.

==Public library==
The Veteran&#x27;s Memorial St. Cloud Library is home to the city of St. Cloud. The branch library is in a remodeled SunTrust Bank, five blocks away from historic downtown St. Cloud. Its hours are Monday-Saturday from 9am to 6pm. The branch offers many programs, such as LIVE storytimes, virtual bookclubs and over 50,000 volumes.

===History of Veterans Memorial Library===
The first form of a library in St. Cloud was in 1910, when the new woman&#x27;s club set up a traveling library and a table at the train station with reading materials for locals. By 1911, there was a reading room that was purchased on Pennsylvania Avenue that the ladies of the town worked to make comfortable and stocked with things to read. Within the next couple of years the collection had outgrown the reading room and moved to the People&#x27;s Bank and then City Hall. In 1915, the town began fundraising to build a proper building. These efforts were put on hold temporarily while war efforts were made a priority. When 1922 rolled around, it was decided that there was enough money to pay an architect to begin planning and building. The contract price was for $4,506.20. The building was extremely well-built and designed with many updated features, including electricity. On February 17, 1923, the new library was dedicated and named &quot;Veteran&#x27;s Memorial Library&quot; which remains today.

From 1923 to 1968, Veteran&#x27;s Memorial Library was operated and taken care of by the Woman&#x27;s Club of St. Cloud. It was in 1968 that it officially became part of the Osceola County Library System. From 1972 to 1974, the location of the library collection moved into a former bank on the corner of New York Avenue and 10th Street. At this point, the original building became a thrift store to benefit the Red Cross and other groups. In 2001, the building was purchased by The City of St. Cloud, and with the help of other organizations was planned to become a museum. The grand opening of The St. Cloud Heritage Museum (pictured below) was held on February 17, 2005.

While the St. Cloud Heritage Museum still proudly boasts the name &quot;Veteran&#x27;s Memorial Library&quot;, the branch location was moved to a former SunTrust bank building on 13th Street and Indiana Avenue in 1995, where it still operates today as part of the Osceola County Library System.

<text>Yeehaw Junction is a census-designated place (CDP) in Osceola County, Florida, United States. As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 240. The area was confused with Buenaventura Lakes CDP in the 2000 census, and the correct data for the area was not recorded.

Yeehaw Junction is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee Metropolitan Statistical Area. The Destiny development was planned nearby.

== Geography ==
Yeehaw Junction is located at the intersection of US 441/SR 15, SR 60 and Florida&#x27;s Turnpike (SR 91), approximately west of Vero Beach and 30 miles north of Lake Okeechobee. The location was named after the Yeehaw station on the Florida East Coast Railway&#x27;s Kissimmee Valley Line, which passed through Yeehaw Junction from 1915 to 1947.

==History==

Some say the community&#x27;s name comes from the fact locals would yell &quot;Yeehaw!&quot;, while others believe the name is derived from the Creek language word meaning &quot;wolf&quot;. According to town historians and several original newspaper articles that are displayed at the Desert Inn and Restaurant, the town was originally named &quot;Jackass Junction&quot; or &quot;Jackass Crossing&quot;. This name was given to the four-corner site back in the early 1930s, when local ranchers rode on burros to visit the Desert Inn (then the local brothel). As the 1950s approached, the Florida legislature felt that a name change was due in light of the construction of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike through the center of the community in 1957, resulting in renaming the town to its present-day name.

===Biological warfare experiment===
In late 1968 the Deseret Test Center conducted a biological warfare experiment at Yeehaw Junction. The experiment was part of Project 112 and was labelled DTC Test 69–75. Stem rust, referred to as &quot;Agent TX&quot;, was tested to determine its effectiveness against a wheat crop in time of war. The tests were conducted over a period of one month from October 31 to December 1, 1968. Live agent was sprayed by a U.S. Air Force McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom fighter jet on seven occasions and dead agent, consisting of spores that were killed by a gaseous mixture of ethylene oxide, was sprayed on four occasions.
The stated objective of Deseret Test Center (DTC) Test 69-75 was to investigate the effectiveness of the F-4/A/B and 45Y-2/TX weapon systems to reduce Soviet wheat crop yields in selected geographic areas. The objective was subdivided into other tasks: determine the downwind travel of Agent TX released from the A/B 45Y-2 spray tank, estimate the yield reduction and loss of wheat crops attacked by the weapon system, study the effectiveness of killed TX as a for Agent TX, and evaluate the adequacy to predict downwind dosages of Agent TX.
The tests were unknown to local residents and officials until October 2002 when U.S. senator Bill Nelson demanded details of the tests from the U.S. Department of Defense after knowledge of the test was eventually revealed during a larger congressional inquiry of potential effects on participating veterans of chemical and biological testing. Eglin Air Force Base, Avon Park Air Force Range, Panama City, Belle Glade, and Fort Pierce, were additional sites in Florida of biological agent production and testing.

==Demographics==

In 2010 Yeehaw Junction had a population of 240. The racial and ethnic composition of the population was 89.2% non-Hispanic white, 1.3% Native American, 0.4% Asian (one person), 2.9% reporting two or more races and 6.3% Hispanic or Latino.

==Present day==

The Yeehaw Junction exit on Florida&#x27;s Turnpike is still active. It was once known as a major stopping point for tourists to purchase conditional discount tickets for various tourist attractions in the Orlando area, but Yeehaw Junction&#x27;s ticket booth has since closed down. The Turnpike exit links with State Road 60, an important traffic route going from Vero Beach on the Atlantic to Tampa and Clearwater Beach on the Gulf Coast. The Turnpike exit at Yeehaw Junction is notable for being the only exit on a nearly 90-mile stretch of the Turnpike. It is located at the southern end of the longest stretch of limited-access highway without an exit in the United States (the next interchange to the north being 48.9 miles away at Kissimmee/St. Cloud) and the northern end of the second-longest such stretch (the next exit to the south being 40.5 miles away at Fort Pierce).

Since the population is not large enough to support its own schools, children in the community can choose to attend Osceola County School District, which may be over an hour&#x27;s bus ride for students (the nearest public school is located in St. Cloud), or be bused to closer schools in Indian River County or Okeechobee County.

The Desert Inn closed temporarily in June 2018. There are plans to reopen it as a museum, restaurant and motel after restorations. 
The Desert Inn was largely destroyed on December 22, 2019, when an 18-wheeler lost control on a nearby road and crashed into the building at highway speeds. The Osceola County Historical Society was court-ordered to sell the property on April 19, 2024 to V6 Holdings LLC, who demolished the property on September 5, 2024.

<doc id="109574" wikidata="Q815854" url="?curid=109574" title="Belle Glade, Florida">
<text>Belle Glade is a city in south-central Florida and it is the far western part of Palm Beach County, Florida, United States, on the southeastern shore of Lake Okeechobee. It is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. According to the 2020 U.S. Census, the city had a population of 16,698, down from 17,467 in the 2010 census.

Belle Glade (and the surrounding area) is sometimes referred to as &quot;Muck City&quot; due to the large quantity of muck, in which sugarcane grows, found in the area. Despite being located in the South Florida region of the state, Belle Glade is culturally more associated with the Florida Heartland.

For a time during the early to mid 1980s, the city had the highest rate of AIDS infection per capita (37 cases in a population of roughly 19,000) in the United States. According to the FBI, in 2003, the city had the second highest violent crime rate in the country at 298 per 10,000 residents. In 2010, the Palm Beach County sheriff&#x27;s office estimated that half of the young men in Belle Glade between the ages of 18 and 25 had felony convictions.

==History==
=== Pre-historic ===
The Belle Glade or Okeechobee culture was an archaeological culture that extended around Lake Okeechobee and included the lower Kissimmee River valley. It existed from as early as 1000 BCE until about 1700 CE. The culture is named for the Belle Glade site, which was excavated in the mid-1930s as part of a Civil Works Administration project. The Belle Glade site included a midden and a burial mound.

=== Settlement ===
The town of Belle Glade was founded during the Florida land boom of the 1920s. During that period, there were a series of efforts made to put in place drainage systems to reclaim dry land from the Everglades, including land around Lake Okeechobee. It was hoped that the reclaimed acreage could be put to better use, including agriculture. In 1921 the Florida legislature established an agricultural research station at Belle Glade to study methods of growing crops on reclaimed Everglades land. At that time, there were already 16 settlements on and around Lake Okeechobee, inhabited by around 2,000 people.

A settlement, originally named Hillsboro, was built at what is now Belle Glade in 1925. In 1926 the Florida East Coast Railway extended its system to Belle Glade, which helped the town&#x27;s development.

=== 1928 hurricane ===
A powerful hurricane struck the area on September 16, 1928. The storm winds caused Lake Okeechobee to overflow its banks, inundating towns around the lake and causing widespread damage in Belle Glade. According to figures compiled by the Florida Department of Health, the storm killed 611 people in Belle Glade alone, and a total of over 1,800 statewide. Contemporary accounts stated that most of the dead were Black migrant farmworkers, a &quot;large percentage&quot; of whom were believed to be from the Bahamas. Belle Glade was rebuilt, and a large dike was erected to protect towns around the lake from storm-driven overflows.

=== World War II ===
German prisoners of war were confined in camps located at Belle Glade and nearby Clewiston during World War II.

=== HIV/AIDS ===
In the early 1980s, researchers began to notice a large number of people with AIDS in Belle Glade. The disease had first been identified by doctors in New York and California in 1981, and it was largely associated with communities of gay men in and around large cities. In Belle Glade, however, people with AIDS mainly identified as heterosexual, and around half were women. Some researchers, and notably Dr. Mark Whiteside and Dr. Carolyn MacLeod of the Institute of Tropical Medicine, in Miami, hypothesized that AIDS in Belle Glade might be connected to poverty and poor living conditions in the city&#x27;s &quot;colored town,&quot; where many people diagnosed with the disease also lived. Their theory, along with the very high per capita AIDS rate in Belle Glade, brought notoriety to the town as the &quot;AIDS capital of the world.&quot; Whiteside and MacLeod&#x27;s theory turned out to be incorrect, but subsequent research conducted in Belle Glade shaped scientific knowledge about the transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, through heterosexual sex.

=== In recent years ===
Today, the area around Lake Okeechobee is fertile and farming is an important industry. Sugar cane and vegetables are grown.

Migrant farmworkers are an important part of the labor force. Belle Glade received national attention when a 1960 CBS television documentary, &quot;Harvest of Shame&quot;, graphically depicted the local migrant farmerworkers&#x27; daily existence and working conditions.

Men and women still gather around 5 a.m. in the same lot you see at the beginning of &quot;Harvest of Shame&quot;, waiting for buses to take them to the fields.

Behring was sold to Cerro Corporation in 1972 and Leadership Housing, Incorporated was formed, a joint-venture between Cerro and the real estate development arm of another conglomerate Texaco Industries, who had previously developed Anaheim Hills. Leadership Housing would develop other upscale communities in the area, and construction progressed significantly in the 1980s.

<text>Boynton Beach is a city in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States. It is situated about north of Miami. The 2020 census recorded a population of 80,380. Boynton Beach is located in the Miami metropolitan area, which was home to 6,138,333 people at the 2020 census. The city is named after Nathan Boynton, a Civil War major and Michigan politician who became one of the first settlers in the area in 1895. Boynton Beach is located north of Delray Beach, south of Hypoluxo and Lantana, and east of Golf, while the municipalities of Briny Breezes, Gulf Stream, Manalapan, and Ocean Ridge are situated to the east across the Intracoastal Waterway.

Native Americans inhabited modern-day Boynton Beach thousands of years ago, with a burial mound west of the city including artifacts dating as far back as roughly 150 BCE. The first non-indigenous settlers, Dexter Hubel and his family, arrived in 1877. Major Boynton moved to present-day Boynton Beach in 1895, building the Boynton Hotel and bringing contingents from Michigan, many of whom practiced farming or established businesses in the vicinity of Ocean Avenue. Byrd and Fred Dewey filed the original plat for the &quot;Town of Boynton&quot; in 1898, although official incorporation did not occur until 1920. The oceanfront section of Boynton Beach split off in 1931 and became Ocean Ridge in 1939. Boynton Beach&#x27;s population grew rapidly in the first few decades following World War II, with more than a three-fold increase in the 1950s, while development of the city expanded westward, particularly in the 1980s.

Today, Boynton Beach is the third-most populous municipality in Palm Beach County, behind only West Palm Beach and Boca Raton. The area along Congress Avenue south of Gateway Boulevard includes a large concentration of restaurants and retail stores at the Boynton Beach Mall, the Boynton Town Center, and Renaissance Commons. Boynton Beach also has several arts and culture facilities, such as the Boynton Woman&#x27;s Club and Schoolhouse Children&#x27;s Museum &amp; Learning Center.

==History==

Archaeological evidence indicates Native American inhabitation of the region dating back thousands of years, with Ais, Calusas, Jaegas, Mayaimis, and Tequesta settling in or near modern-day Palm Beach County. A complex of mounds west of present-day Boynton Beach and near the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge includes shards of pottery possibly from 150 BCE. An excavation of the site also yielded beads and glass from as recently as the 16th century, which are believed to have been influenced by the Spanish.

Captain James A. Armour, head keeper of the Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse, filed the first land claim in modern-day Boynton Beach in 1875, although it is unlikely he lived there. Two years later, Dexter Hubel of Michigan and his family settled in the area, but they had to live at the Orange Grove House of Refuge in present-day Delray Beach until their house was built.

In 1894, two years before Henry Flagler built his railroad, a former American Civil War major named Nathan Boynton first set eyes on the area that now bears his name. Boynton hailed from Port Huron, Michigan. He was so impressed by the natural beauty of the year-round sunshine and pristine beaches, he built the famous Boynton Hotel, where he also spent winters with his family. The hotel, which opened in 1897, included accommodations for 100 guests and 5 guest cottages. Major Boynton died on May 27, 1911, in Port Huron, but the hotel lasted until 1925. Several commercial and residential buildings also sprang up along Ocean Avenue in the late 1890s, including the first post office in 1896.

The first settlers, whom Boynton had brought along from Michigan, soon realized that many fruits and vegetables thrived in the fertile climate. Pineapples, tomatoes, mangoes, and citrus fruit were packed in crates and shipped across the country on the newly built Florida East Coast Railroad. Alonzo King and Samuel Cade, both African American farmers, taught these early settlers methods for cultivating muck soil and dealing with the presence of mosquitos and rattlesnakes.

Boynton Beach was founded on September 26, 1898, when Byrd Spilman Dewey and her husband Fred S. Dewey filed the original plat in the Dade County courthouse for the &quot;Town of Boynton&quot;. Fred S. Dewey, one of Flager&#x27;s secretaries, bought a large area of land west of the Intracoastal Waterway earlier that year. He subdivided the land into 2.5 acre (1.0 ha) tracts for agricultural uses, which he sold to settlers and hotel workers. Buyers of these tracts also received a plot within the residential sections of the townsite.

A wood-frame schoolhouse opened in 1900 at Ocean Avenue and Seacrest Boulevard, replacing a smaller, temporary building. By then, the town had a population of 83. Just four years later, a second, two-room school building opened as the community continued to grow quickly. Overcrowding at the school at Ocean Avenue and Seacrest Boulevard also led to the construction of another school in 1913, a two-story concrete building with six classrooms. This building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was converted into the Schoolhouse Children&#x27;s Museum &amp; Learning Center in 2001.

The first bridge crossing the Intracoastal Waterway opened in 1911 at Ocean Avenue. During the same year, the Boynton Woman&#x27;s Club and the Florida Federal of Women&#x27;s Clubs established the first library in Boynton, then staffed by volunteers. The 1910s also saw the creation of the town&#x27;s first bank in 1915 and first ocean road (State Road A1A) in 1916.

The town of Boynton was officially incorporated in 1920 upon the approval of 48 out of the 50 qualified voters who met at the Boynton Lumber Club on April 14. G. E. Coon became the first mayor, Fred Benson became the first town marshall, and A. A. Atwater, J. P. Bowen, C. M. Jensen, A. C. Shepherd, and W. S. Shepherd became the first aldermen. Shortly before the incorporation of Boynton, the 1920 census recorded a population of 671 people in Palm Beach County&#x27;s fourth precinct, which also included Hypoluxo and the area that now comprises Ocean Ridge. The name &quot;Boynton Beach&quot; was first used by a community that broke off from the Town of Boynton in 1931. In 1939, that community changed its name to &quot;Ocean Ridge&quot; while The Town of Boynton took the name &quot;Boynton Beach&quot; in 1941.

Utility services also began in Boynton in the early 1920s. John Meredith brought electricity to the town in 1921, the same year as the installation of a sewage system. Additionally, in 1923, a municipal water system began operating. Telephone service arrived in Boynton near the end of the 1920s.

Boynton Beach Oceanfront Park is located just north of the original Boynton Hotel site. In 1921, the Town of Boynton acquired the beach site from Lewis S. Howe by eminent domain for park and recreation purposes. The beach casino was built in 1928 and featured a large dining hall, locker rooms and showers and residents used the casino for parties and social gatherings. The casino was demolished in 1967 and the property remained part of the beach park. From the 1920s to today, Boynton Beach Oceanfront Park has been popular with residents and visitors alike. In the mid-1990s, the park underwent a major renovation during which the boardwalk was rebuilt out of recycled plastic. Boynton Beach&#x27;s Oceanfront Park was voted the best family beach in Palm Beach County by &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot; in 2001. In 2011 the boardwalk was renovated again, replacing the plastic with ipe (pronounced ee-pay) wood (commonly known as Brazilian walnut). In 2012 improvements were made to the buildings along the boardwalk, including total refurbishment of the restrooms.

In 1926, the Seaboard Air Line Railway entered what was then simply Boynton, spurring land development a mile inland near the Seaboard station, including the town&#x27;s first planned subdivision, Lake Boynton Estates. As land became more valuable, areas along the Intracoastal Waterway and the Federal Highway in Boynton also saw housing developments. To the west, many dairies were founded so that the Boynton area became the main milk supplier for Palm Beach County. By the 1970s, the dairies were no longer profitable and these lands too were converted to housing developments.

Three hurricanes affected Boynton between 1926 and 1928. The 1928 Okeechobee hurricane in particular caused significant impacts, destroying 46 homes and 18 buildings, including a church, a hotel, and the town hall. Additionally, the storm damaged 255 homes and 34 buildings, including the high school, where 15 people suffered injuries after auditorium roof collapsed. The hurricane rendered 56 families homeless and caused approximately $1 million in damage. The Boynton town government faced financial struggles in the aftermath of the 1928 hurricane and during the Great Depression, but received some assistance from the Florida Legislature and negotiated with bondholders for additional debt relief. Funds from the state also resulted in the resurfacing of Dixie Highway, while federal funds were used to construct a new bridge across the Intracoastal Waterwater in 1935.

Boynton Beach grew very rapidly in the 1950s, with its population expanding from 2,542 people in 1950 to 10,467 people in 1960, a 311.8% increase. Significant construction projects during the decade included a new city hall at Boynton Beach Boulevard and Seacrest Boulevard in 1958 and Bethesda Memorial Hospital in 1959. The expansion of beachfront recreation facilities also occurred as the city purchased more coastal properties.

During the 1960s, the city constructed a civic center in 1960, a public library in 1961, and a new water treatment plant in 1962. A second bridge across the Intracoastal Waterway opened in 1967 along 15th Avenue (Woolbright Road). The decade also marked beginning of the construction of Interstate 95 through the city (completed in 1977), the westward expansion of Boynton Beach Boulevard in 1962, the southward extension of Congress Avenue in 1966. Additionally, residential projects such as the large Hampshire Gardens, Leisureville, and Sterling Village sprang up, causing further growth and economic development. A few civil rights movement protests also occurred in Boynton Beach during the 1960s, including a sit-in at the Royal Castle Restaurant and the arrival of approximately 30 African Americans at a whites-only section of the beach in 1962.

Several developments also brought a substantial economic boost to Boynton Beach in the 1980s. First, Motorola opened a new paging plant in the city in 1983, although the complex closed in 2004, about 10 years after its peak, when the facility employed approximately 3,500 people. Next, the Boynton Beach Mall and Quantum Corporate Park opened in 1985 and 1988, respectively. Additionally, Tri-Rail began operating in 1989, opening its station in Boynton Beach in December of that year. Each of these factors attracted more businesses to the area and generated rapid population increases in the city&#x27;s western suburbs.

Hurricane Wilma struck Boynton Beach on October 24, 2005, causing widespread damage to homes and businesses. In 2006, the city government authorized the demolition of the historic Seaboard rail station, which had survived intact in private hands since passenger service to the station halted in 1971.

On March 8, 2022, Ty Penserga was elected mayor of Boynton Beach in Florida, making him the first openly gay mayor of the city as well as the first out LGBTQ Asian American mayor elected in Florida state history. A high school biology and chemistry teacher, Penserga was sworn into office by State Attorney Dave Aronberg.

== Crime ==

The year 2006 saw an increase in gang-related violent crime. This mirrored a similar increase across Palm Beach County. A gang-related shooting that resulted in a death at the city&#x27;s popular Boynton Beach Mall on Christmas Eve of 2006 caught the national attention on many news networks, such as CBS. There were ten known operating gangs in the city as of 2007, according to police, including the notorious South Florida Haitian Zoe Pound gang. As of 2009, countywide gang violence had fallen three percent.

On January 27, 2012, Mayor Jose Rodriguez was suspended from office by the state governor for trying to influence a police investigation into his personal affairs.

The crime rate started decreasing in 2017 and attained its lowest number in 20 years in 2020. According to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement&#x27;s 2020 Annual Crime Report, the total crime rate decreased by 28 percent in the city compared to 2019 and 64 percent compared to 2001. Violent crime, which includes murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault, decreased 8.5 percent. Property crime, which includes burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft, dropped by 32.2 percent. Florida&#x27;s total crime volume dropped 14.1 percent compared to 2019.

Boynton Beach Police Chief Michael G. Gregory attributed the decrease to focused efforts, an all-hands-on-deck approach and &quot;using a multitude of tactics and crime fighting strategies that are constantly evolving based on crime patterns&quot;.

==Historic preservation==
The Boynton Beach Historical Society formed in 1968. According to its website, the historical society&#x27;s mission is &quot;to act as a living repository for Boynton Beach&#x27;s traditions and history, to interpret items of historical and antiquarian significance, and to promote a better understanding of the history of Boynton Beach, Palm Beach County and the State of Florida.&quot; The organization does not have a physical location. As such, the Boynton Beach Public Library houses its archives and records. In addition to Boynton Beach, the historical society also maintains materials relevant to the histories of Briny Breezes, Gulf Stream, Hypoluxo, Lake Worth Beach, Lantana, Manalapan, and Ocean Ridge, as well as areas from the city&#x27;s western boundaries to U.S. Route 441.

The city&#x27;s Historic Resources and Preservation Board lists 170 historic sites, including commercial and residential buildings, bridges, cemeteries, churches, social clubs, and other architectural features. Additionally, the board maintains two heritage trails, one for the 30 sites listed in downtown and another for the 3 historic cemeteries. Federally, Boynton Beach has two structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places – the Boynton Woman&#x27;s Club and the Boynton School, now known as the Schoolhouse Children&#x27;s Museum &amp; Learning Center.

==Controversy==
Boynton Beach commissioned a mural showing three of its firefighters, unveiled in 2020, for a window covering at a new fire station. The mural depicted former fire chief Glenn Joseph, and former deputy fire chief Latosha Clemons, both of whom are Black. Clemons was the city&#x27;s first Black female fire fighter. The mural depicted both of them as White, and Clemons sued the city for defamation, libel and negligence. The city has since removed the mural and settled the lawsuit.

<text>Briny Breezes is a town in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States. The town is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. Briny Breezes (or &quot;Briny&quot; as it is known locally) is a small coastal community of approximately 488 mobile homes along State Road A1A. Briny is a private community consisting mostly of &quot;snowbirds&quot; from the Northeastern, the Midwest, and Canada. It and Ocean Breeze are the only two mobile home parks in Florida that are incorporated towns. The population was 502 at the 2020 US census.

==History==
In 1919, the land housed a dairy farm owned by Michigan lumberman Ward Miller. Around the time of the Great Depression, he allowed tourists, who brought their trailers down from the North, to camp on his land. He began advertising the land by placing flyers in Northern newspapers, such as the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, that touted Briny&#x27;s &quot;$3 a week rent.&quot; In 1958, Miller wanted to retire and made an offer to the campers to buy the land: $2,000 per lot and $2,500 for those near the water. The campers brought their assets together and the town was incorporated on March 19, 1963, complete with its own mayor and post office.

The town&#x27;s first mayor was Hugh David. He held office until his death in 1997, and was never opposed in an election. His successor, Robert Conkey, also died in office only months into his second term in 2000. Conkey&#x27;s second term was notable as he won the election by only five votes.

In its beginnings, the town was mainly made up of families that came to live during the winter. Now, the residents are senior citizens that live there either year round or just in the winter.

Briny Breezes was used as the setting for the 2005 film &quot;In Her Shoes&quot;, and many of its residents served as extras in the movie. Parts of the 1992 comedy-drama movie &quot;Folks!&quot;, starring Tom Selleck and Don Ameche, were also filmed in Briny Breezes.

===Development===
In October 2005, developer Jean Francois Roy, of Ocean Land Investments, made an offer to buy the entire town for $500 million. This would equate to an average of slightly more than $1 million per residential lot. In December 2005, it was announced that 73 percent of the 488 lot owners had voted to hire a lawyer to pursue the sale. Later, Roy raised his offer to $510 million.

Had the sale gone through, it would have meant a huge windfall for each lot owner. Many people paid between $30,000 and $40,000 when they purchased their homes. In comparison, the 2000 census reported $129,000 was the median value of a home in Briny.

A vote to ratify the deal was set for January 10, 2007, and 80 percent of residents approved of the sale, with 97 percent of owners voting. The residents would not receive any compensation until 2009 and the plan was yet to be approved by state and local officials, due to zoning concerns.

However, on July 30, 2007, when the &quot;earnest money&quot; was due to the town, the deal was cancelled by the land developer over a dispute with the town board of directors over how long a period was to be allowed for due diligence.

<doc id="109580" wikidata="Q2346519" url="?curid=109580" title="Canal Point, Florida">
<text>Canal Point is a census-designated place (CDP) and unincorporated community in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida despite its local culture and location being way more similar to the Florida Heartland. Canal Point has a population of 344 people counted in the 2020 US census. 

The land was originally inhabited by the Calusa tribe until 1650 CE. White settlers began occupying the area in 1909, establishing an agrarian community that currently still relies heavily on agriculture, especially sugar from sugarcane crops. The completion of the West Palm Beach Canal in 1917 allowed crops to be shipped by boat to West Palm Beach and then to other areas of the country, while construction of Conners Highway in 1924 resulted in crops being transported by motor vehicle. The CDP is very small with very little infrastructure. 

==Geography==
Canal Point is located at (26.862060, -80.630543).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

Canal Point is located along the eastern shore of Lake Okeechobee, to the northeast of Pahokee and to the northwest of Bryant.

===Climate===
==History==
Archaeological evidence from Big Mound City, located roughly of Canal Point, suggests that the Calusa tribe inhabited the area between about 500 BCE and 1650 CE. In 1909, Canal Point became the first White settlement on the eastern shore of Lake Okeechobee. The Southern States Land and Timber Company began planting sugarcane in the area in 1917. Around that time, the West Palm Beach Canal was completed. The canal connected Lake Okeechobee at Canal Point to West Palm Beach, allowing farms to sell crops to West Palm Beach or elsewhere in the United States via the Florida East Coast Railway. Transportation of crops by motor vehicle from the area to other destinations began in 1924 with the completion of Conners Highway, which mostly followed the path of the West Palm Beach Canal.

Unlike other communities along the southeastern and eastern shores of Lake Okeechobee, Canal Point was relatively unscathed by the 1928 hurricane.

<doc id="109587" wikidata="Q1992826" url="?curid=109587" title="Glen Ridge, Florida">
<text>Glen Ridge is a town and registered bird sanctuary in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. The population was 217 in the 2020 US census.

==History==
In 1932, the Trout family constructed and moved into the first house built in the area that became Glen Ridge. Twin brothers Kenyon and Karl Riddle purchased land west of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, south of Southern Boulevard, and northeast of the West Palm Beach Canal in 1935. For reasons not entirely certain, the housing development split, with part of it becoming the neighboring town of Cloud Lake, in 1951. Glen Ridge, a municipality, was incorporated on December 11, 1947, and received its name by resident Helen Mosler&#x27;s suggestion, stating that the wooded canal bank resembled the ridge of a glen.

Upon incorporation, residents elected John D. Watts as mayor; Ernest T. Delburn, Allison T. French, Max Mosler, Richard W. Owen, and John B. Tschirgi as aldermen; Josephyne H. French as town clerk; and John P. Stine as town manager. Three years later, the 1950 census recorded a population of 126 in Glen Ridge. Council elections were held in the mayor&#x27;s garage and meetings occurred in the members&#x27; houses through the mid-1990s, when the town began renting a storefront along Southern Boulevard. Glen Ridge opened a permanent town hall and community center in September 2002, after expending approximately $110,000 to repurpose a former residence. A 2014 &quot;Palm Beach Post&quot; profile on Glen Ridge reported that the town contained about 100 homes and levied no property taxes. Glen Ridge was also described as a bird sanctuary because the &quot;dense green foliage forms a canopy over the street as you drive in.&quot;

<doc id="109590" wikidata="Q990948" url="?curid=109590" title="Greenacres, Florida">
<text>Greenacres is a city in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Miami metropolitan area in South Florida. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 43,990 residents.

Frederick E. Bryant, Harold J. Bryant, and William Greenwood of the Palm Beach Farms Company began buying and selling thousands of acres of land in the area by 1909. However, difficulties with farming in wetland conditions left the land mostly unused until the 1920s land boom. Lawrence Carter &quot;L. C.&quot; Swain then platted the original section of Greenacres beginning in 1923. The community was incorporated as &quot;Greenacres City&quot; on May 24, 1926, with the name being drawn out of a hat. The city was dis-incorporated under controversial circumstances in 1945, before being officially re-incorporated in 1947. The city&#x27;s population remained small until rapid growth began in the 1970s. Residents voted to rename the community &quot;Greenacres&quot; in 1990.

Today, Greenacres is a diverse and relatively large community in terms of population. John I. Leonard High School, the largest high school in Palm Beach County and one of the largest in Florida, has been located in Greenacres since the city annexed the property in 1994.

==History==
In 1909, Frederick E. Bryant—a British agriculturalist—Harold J. Bryant, and William Greenwood of the Palm Beach Farms Company in Colorado, bought thousands of acres of land in the Everglades and later along the coast of Lake Worth in 1910. The men sold the land to buyers throughout the United States and Canada, offering plots for $250, with a $10 down payment and a $10 per month charge, which also included a parcel on the shore of Lake Worth. However, difficulties involved with farming in the Everglades forced 308 buyers to settle at their properties along Lake Worth, an area that would later become the city of Lake Worth Beach. Until the land boom of the 1920s, these lots were effectively abandoned. Around that time, Lawrence Carter &quot;L. C.&quot; Swain of Massachusetts acquired of land, with the intention of creating a community for the working class. He initially platted approximately half of the land in 1923, with a plat just west of Military Trail becoming the original section of the city. By 1925, Swain began selling lots for $225.

The town was originally incorporated as Greenacres City on May 24, 1926. The name Greenacres was the winning entry in a local naming contest. Upon incorporating, the town had an estimated 1,250 residents. Swain also became honorary mayor, before the first officials were elected, which included J. H. Southard as mayor, G. W. Simpson as clerk, A. P. Lane as marshal, and S. R. Allen, A. E. Fernell, Robert Hansen, C. Martin, I. E. Shivers, and F. L. Woods as aldermen. Additionally, G. W. Fleenor of Lake Worth became acting attorney. In September of that year, a hurricane destroyed the civic building and community hall, but did not cause much other significant damage. Two years later, Greenacres City was devastated by the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane, which damaged &quot;practically every building&quot; substantially, according to &quot;The Lake Worth Herald&quot;.

Swain died in 1944; Swain Boulevard and L. C. Swain Middle School are named in his honor. In 1945, about 125 residents petitioned for the Florida Legislature to abolish Greenacres City as a municipality. The legislature passed a bill to dis-incorporate Greenacres City in April of that year, which became a law on April 24, 1945, without the signature of Governor Millard Caldwell. Then-Mayor Charles A. Grabowski actively fought the new law, as no referendum to forfeit the town&#x27;s charter had been held. Additionally, Grabowski accused a resident of starting the dissolution movement out of spite after being denied a homestead exemption and claimed that many of the signatories did not actually own property in Greenacres City. Grabowski also asserted that the pleas of city officials and a large number of residents in favor of remaining a town were ignored. On December 4, 1945, a meeting was held to reincorporate Greenacres City. A total of 86 out of 120 registered voters turned out, more than the two-thirds of voters quorum required. The 86 voters unanimously decided to reincorporate. The area&#x27;s rights as a city were restored, while Greenacres City was officially reincorporated in 1947. Over the subsequent decades, Greenacres City eventually expanded to through annexation.

In the 1960s, a city hall complex was constructed at the intersection of Perry Avenue and Fourth Street, while a community center was built nearby. The city hall complex originally included a public library and all other city departments, except for the fire and public works departments. By the 1970s, full-time police and fire departments were established. In response to concerns about future growth, residents approved a bond referendum in 1984 to fund construction of a new city hall, a public safety complex, and recreational facilities. On November 6, 1990, about 60% of voters chose to drop the word &quot;city&quot; from the official name, thus renaming the municipality &quot;Greenacres&quot;. After the 1990 census indicated a population of 18,638, city council authorized a special census in 1993, which added more than 3,000 additional residents to the official population count, making Greenacres eligible for funds from the state government of Florida. To commemorate the city&#x27;s 80th anniversary, the Greenacres Historical Society was formed in 2006, with a museum established two years later. In July 2007, construction was completed on a new city hall and public works facility on Melaleuca Lane.

<text>Hypoluxo is a town in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States. The town was incorporated in 1955 and is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. It is home to the Hypoluxo Scrub Natural Area, which is a protected landscape. The population was 2,687 at the 2020 US Census.

== Etymology ==

The origin of the name &quot;Hypoluxo&quot; is disputed. One theory analyzed the name as composed of the Greek root &quot;hypo-&quot; (under, below average) and the Latin &quot;lux&quot; (light). Hannibel Pierce settled on Hypoluxo Island with his family in 1873. His son, Charlie W. Pierce reported that a Seminole woman told his mother that the Seminole name for Lake Worth was &quot;Hypoluxo&quot;, which he thought meant &#x27;island&#x27;, or as he put it using his marginal command of the English language: &quot;water all around, no get out&quot;. The name that the Pierces wrote as &quot;Hypoluxo&quot; was given as &quot;Opoloccha&quot; in a history posted by the Town of Hypoluxo. J. Clarence Simpson, citing William A. Read, states that the name is from the Creek-Seminole &quot;Hapo&quot;, meaning &quot;mound&quot; and &quot;Plotski&quot;, meaning &quot;round&quot;, thus &quot;round mound&quot;. The name &quot;Hypoluxo&quot; appears on an 1841 War Department map.

==History==

The area that is now the Town of Hypoluxo was first settled in 1884 by Andrew Walton Garnett, James Edward Hamilton and James William Porter. Gannett and Hamilton carried the mail between the Lake Worth area and Miami as barefoot mailmen. In 1955, it was officially incorporated as a town.

==Controversies==

The city government of Hypoluxo claims that certain streets, particularly in Hypoluxo Park, have a &quot;public designation&quot; but are not maintained by the city. As a result, some areas are maintained neither by the city nor any neighborhood association. For example, a seawall on the Intracoastal Waterway in Hypoluxo Park failed in 2019, leading to a dispute over whether the city would pay for repairs.

==History==

As a sister settlement to the town of Jupiter to the north, the development was named, at some point in the 19th century, after Jupiter&#x27;s wife, the ancient Roman goddess Juno. The designation in 1944 of a namesake D-Day landing beach in Normandy, named for Juno Dawnay, a Canadian officer&#x27;s wife, was purely coincidental.

A pier was built in 1950 and the town was platted in 1948. It was officially incorporated as a town in 1953. The original pier was destroyed during a November storm in 1984 and a new 993-foot Juno Beach Pier built in 1999.

=== During the Second World War ===

During World War II, German U-boats patrolled this coastline. Tankers were a favorite target as they transported oil via the swift, northbound gulf stream which runs close to the south Florida coast.  

A submarine attacked this tanker south of Juno Beach, off Singer Island.
With these submarines offshore, people feared that our sparsely inhabited coastline would be ideal for landing parties of German spies or saboteurs.  To watch for them: &quot;A beach patrol was formed, and men on horseback rode along the beach to warn of enemy activity. . . Wounded American sailors, whose ships had been sunk by the submarines, occasionally were found on the beach and rushed to the hospital . . . by the townspeople.&quot; - Nora Fitzgerald, a local resident.

The U.S. Coast Guard leased the Surf Cottages motel during the war. Horseback beach patrols, which included civilian volunteers, used the motel car sheds across the street as stables.

Juno Beach is located at (26.873404, –80.054063).

<text>Jupiter is the northernmost town in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States. According to the 2020 US Census, the town had a population of 61,047. It is 84 miles north of Miami and 15 miles north of West Palm Beach. Along with the adjacent Village of Tequesta, Jupiter is considered the northernmost municipality in the Miami metropolitan area. It was named the 9th Best Southern Beach Town to live in by &quot;Stacker Newsletter&quot; for 2022, was rated as the 12th Best Beach Town in the United States by &quot;WalletHub&quot; in 2018, and as the 9th Happiest Seaside Town in the United States by &quot;Coastal Living&quot; in 2012.

==History==
The area where the town now sits was originally named for the Hobe Indian tribe which lived at the mouth of the Loxahatchee River and whose name is also preserved in the name of nearby Hobe Sound. A mapmaker misunderstood the Spanish spelling &quot;Jobe&quot; of the native people name &quot;Hobe&quot; and recorded it as &quot;Jove&quot;. Subsequent mapmakers further misunderstood this to be the name of the Roman god Jupiter, because the declension of the word Jupiter in Latin includes the root in all cases but the nominative case and vocative case. They, therefore, adopted the more familiar name of &quot;Jupiter&quot;. The god Jupiter (or Zeus in the Greek mythology) is the chief Roman god, and the god of light, of the sky and weather, and of the state and its welfare and laws. Jupiter&#x27;s consort was Juno, inspiring a neighboring town to name itself Juno Beach.

The Battles of the Loxahatchee took place near the site of Jupiter during the Seminole Wars in 1838. The most notable landmark is the Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse, completed in 1860. Made of brick, it was painted red in 1910 to cover discoloration caused by humidity. Hurricane Jeanne in 2004 sandblasted the paint from the upper portion of the tower, and the tower was repainted using a potassium silicate mineral coating. The lighthouse often is used as the symbol for Jupiter.

=== United States flag incident ===
In 1999, Jupiter resident George Andres wanted to display a United States flag in his front yard; however, the homeowners association had a bylaw that prohibits the display of a flagpole in the front lawn. Andres still displayed the flag, while the homeowners association continued litigation until George Andres foreclosed his home to cover legal fees after being in court at least twenty-eight times. Even after governor Jeb Bush visited his home along with members of the local and national media, the homeowners association, as well as George, refused to budge.

George Andres later won the case and was allowed to display his flag in his front lawn with the use of a flagpole.

On July 24, 2006, President George W. Bush signed into law the Freedom to Display the American Flag Act of 2005, allowing residents to display the flag on their residential property despite any homeowners association rules.

<text>Lake Clarke Shores is a town in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States. The town is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. The 2020 census recorded a population of 3,564.

The town was named after John Newton Clarke, who first filed a homestead claim in the area in 1897. Clarke intended to capitalize on the business of growing pineapples, but his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. Very few people lived in the area until local attorney Walter Travers created a plan to develop a community around Lake Clarke and purchased of land for $10,000 in the late 1940s. The completion of a bridge across the West Palm Beach Canal in 1953 spurred a further growth in population. With rumors spreading that West Palm Beach intended to annex the community, residents voted by a wide margin to support the incorporation of Lake Clarke Shores as a town on April 10, 1956, which the Florida Legislature officially approved in July 1, 1957.

Today, Lake Clarke Shores maintains a small population. The town is primarily a bedroom community, with most of its businesses and other commercial buildings located along Forest Hill Boulevard (State Road 882).

==History==

The town of Lake Clarke Shores was named after John Newton Clarke, a general store grocer, postmaster in Lake Worth (now known as Lake Worth Beach), and Royal Poinciana Hotel employee who filed a homestead claim in 1897 for a 139 acre (56 hectare) area of land on the eastern shore of a lake situated just west of West Palm Beach. Clarke would later name the lake after himself. He also purchased of land in West Palm Beach near where Hillcrest Cemetery and Parker Avenue stand today. Attempting to capitalize on the promising pineapple growing business, Clarke used the property for growing pineapples and operating a packinghouse. However, the thriving pineapple business in South Florida suffered extensive losses in 1910, and the completion Henry Flagler&#x27;s railway to Key West in 1912 allowed pineapples from Cuba to be shipped to the northern United States more cost-effectively than from Florida. Clarke and many others in South Florida abandoned the pineapple industry by 1915. Thereafter, Clarke used the land as a fishing retreat. However, Lake Clarke, which had stretched from Southern Boulevard (State Road 84) to the city of Lake Worth, was reduced to a marsh and fell about in height in 1917 upon completion of the West Palm Beach Canal.

In the early 1930s, Zeb Vance Hooker and his family became the first settlers in modern-day Lake Clarke Shores by squatting in a wooden shack on land by the southeast side of Lake Clarke. In 1946, Patsy Renolds built a house where Antigua Road stands today and is the oldest home in Lake Clarke Shores. By the late 1940s, local attorney Walter Travers visited the area and bought the lakeshore properties from their respective owners. Travers then attempted to buy land which had been drained during the construction of the West Palm Beach Canal in the 1910s. The state of Florida initially denied his request. However, after meeting with the Trustees of the Internal Improvement Fund in Tallahassee, the board offered Travers the land for $300 per acre. Travers partially agreed but attempted to negotiate a lesser cost for land at lower elevations. The state then decided to auction the land. Travers was the only bidder and obtained of land on the northwest periphery of the lake for $10,000, which a friend loaned to him. After obtaining $5,000 for an unrelated lawsuit settlement, Travers invested that money into his project to transform the area into a waterfront community and brought in dredging equipment in 1949. The fledgling community initially grew very slowly, with just three homes built by 1952. One reason for the slow growth was the lack of a bridge across the West Palm Beach Canal. Palm Beach County Commissioner Lake Lytal convinced the county commission to approve the building of a bridge, knowing that Travers intended to contribute $10,000 to its construction. The bridge, completed in 1953, connected Selby Road and Forest Hill Boulevard (State Road 882) – with the entirety of the road becoming Forest Hill Boulevard – and resulted in a quicker increase in development and population.

Rumors spread that West Palm Beach planned to annex the area, prompting 60 people to form the Lake Clarke Property Owners’ Association in 1955. The association first met at a private residence, before meeting regularly at Meadow Park Elementary School. After reaching consensus on the name &quot;Lake Clarke Shores&quot;, residents met there on April 10, 1956, to decide on incorporation. Because the Florida Legislature did not meet in 1956, incorporation would have to be supported by two-thirds of voters. A total of 117 votes were cast, with 113 in favor and 4 in opposition to incorporating. Thus, the motion succeeded. William H. McLaughlin was unanimously selected to be the first mayor of Lake Clarke Shores, while Horace J. Cunningham, William M. Diemer, Robert G. Hillbert, Charles G. Platt, and Frank M. Seay served as the town&#x27;s first aldermen. Other elected officials included Betty Diemer as town clerk, William H. Blythe as town marshal, and John Farrell as town attorney. The Florida Legislature approved the citizens vote to incorporate on July 1, 1957, when the town was granted the State Charter.

Development continued rapidly after Forest Hill Community High School opened just across the West Palm Beach Canal from Lake Clark Shores in 1958. The first census of the town occurred in 1960, which recorded a population of 1,297. In its early years, Lake Clarke Shores was almost entirely residential in nature. A 1962 description of the town in &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot; noted that Forest Hill Baptist Church (now New Life Alliance Church) was the only non-residential building. However, the town council began passing ordinances later in the 1960s to allow commercial properties along Forest Hill Boulevard. The first commercial building, a gas station, opened at the corner of Forest Hill Boulevard and Florida Mango Road in June 1967. The town council, having long recognized the need for a town hall, finally authorized the construction of a town hall on Barbados Road in the 1970s, which opened in August 1974. The town hall would be dedicated on February 20, 1977. About 10 years later, in May 1987, a building headquartering the Lake Clarke Shores Police Department was completed.

== Religion ==
Mt. Olive Missionary Baptist Church of Lake Harbor is a testament to resilience and determination in the face of adversity. The church was founded in 1924 by Pastor Riley on the west side of the Miami canal, along Miami Canal Road. It quickly became a pillar of the community, providing spiritual guidance and support to its African America members of Lake Harbor community and surround sugar and agriculture farms.

However, the young church faced a devastating setback in 1928 when the Okeechobee hurricane, also known as the San Felipe Segundo hurricane, struck the region. The hurricane&#x27;s destructive force was overwhelming, and Mt. Olive Missionary Baptist Church was not spared. The church building was destroyed, leaving the congregation in a state of disarray and uncertainty.

In a remarkable act of generosity, Mutt Thomas, the owner and operator of C.A. Thomas Farms, donated both land and a new building for the church. The new location was on the east side of the Miami canal, along Mutt Thomas Road. With this gift, the church was able to rebuild and continue its mission.

Over the years, the church had several pastors, but one of the most prominent figures was Pastor Aaron Drayton. Under his leadership, the church experienced growth and expansion. Pastor Drayton also played a significant role in nurturing young ministers within the congregation. Among them were Pastor Willie C. Thornton, Pastor Freddie Lee Thornton, and Pastor John Holman, who were licensed under his guidance.

When Pastor Aaron Drayton retired, Pastor John Holman assumed the role of pastor and continued the church&#x27;s growth trajectory. The congregation flourished under his leadership, fostering a strong sense of community and faith.

However, in October 2005, Hurricane Wilma struck the area, once again wreaking havoc on the church. The building was destroyed, and the congregation faced the challenge of rebuilding yet again. Undeterred, Pastor John Holman and the devoted members of Mt. Olive Missionary Baptist Church found alternative locations to continue their worship and community activities.

In September 2011, Pastor John Holman led the congregation in a significant milestone when they purchased a church building in Belle Glade, Florida. This new location provided a more permanent home for Mt. Olive Missionary Baptist Church, allowing them to rebuild and strengthen their presence in the community.

General aviation has a much closer link to Lake Harbor, as Belle Glade State Municipal Airport is located less than ten miles away from the town.

<doc id="109607" wikidata="Q984358" url="?curid=109607" title="Lake Worth Beach, Florida">
<text>Lake Worth Beach, previously named Lake Worth, is a city in east-central Palm Beach County, Florida, United States, located about north of Miami. The city&#x27;s name is derived from the body of water along its eastern border known as the Lake Worth Lagoon, which was named for General William J. Worth, who led United States Army forces during the last part of the Second Seminole War. Lake Worth Beach is situated south of West Palm Beach, southeast of Lake Clarke Shores, east of Palm Springs, and north of Lantana, while a small section of the city also partitions the town of Palm Beach. The 2010 census recorded a population of 34,910, which increased to 42,219 in the 2020 census. Lake Worth Beach is within the Miami metropolitan area, which was home to an estimated 6,138,333 people in 2020.

While archaeological evidence indicates that the Jaega inhabited nearby areas thousands of years ago, Samuel and Fannie James, an African American couple, became the first known settlers in modern-day Lake Worth Beach in 1885, filing a homestead claim on . Fannie James operated the Jewell Post Office from 1889 to 1903 to serve the few residents who lived between Lantana and West Palm Beach. A land development scheme by Bryant &amp; Greenwood in the 1910s allowed buyers to receive a parcel of land if they purchased a lot in present-day Greenacres. Consequently, the population increased from 38 in July 1912 to 308 only five months later. The town of &quot;Lake Worth&quot; was incorporated in June 1913. Its first elected mayor was James Love, a carpenter and member of the Socialist Party of America. Thereafter, Lake Worth grew rapidly during the 1920s land boom and in the decades following World War II. Residents voted to change the official name to Lake Worth Beach in 2019.

Today, Lake Worth Beach is a city featuring several historic neighborhoods, such as the National Register of Historic Places-listed College Park and Old Lucerne, while the downtown area also has dozens of buildings that are part of the Historic Old Town Commercial District. Lake Worth Beach is one of the most ethnically and racially diverse municipalities in Palm Beach County, with a large working class population compared to other coastal cities in Palm Beach County. Several cultural events are hosted annually in the city, including a street painting festival, several ethnic festivals, and Palm Beach Pride, one of the largest LGBTQIA+ pride festivals in Florida.

==History==

===Prior to incorporation===

Native Americans migrated into Florida beginning about 12,000 years ago. While evidence near the town of Jupiter indicates local inhabitation dating back to the Paleo-Indian period, the Jaega were the first known tribe to have resided along the Florida Atlantic coast in the areas of Martin and Palm Beach counties. The remains of shell mounds sites, mostly dating back to approximately 750–1500 CE, attest to pre-Columbian Jaega inhabitation near Lake Worth Beach, including in Boynton Beach, Palm Beach, and South Palm Beach.

Among the city&#x27;s first non-indigenous settlers were Samuel and Fannie James. The Jameses were an African American couple reported to be ex-slaves, known as the Black Diamonds, who settled on the shores of the Lake Worth Lagoon near the current 5th Avenue South in 1885. A stone monument dedicated to Samuel and Fannie James at the northwest corner of Lucerne Avenue (State Road 802) and J Street inaccurately uses the date 1883, due to a transcription error. The couple made a claim for their land under the Homestead Act in 1885. Their holdings, originally , increased over time to more than , including of homestead land south of Lake Avenue (State Road 802) between M and F Streets; in modern-day College Park, acquired from the estate of William Stephan, where Fannie ran a pineapple farm; and to the south between the current Dixie and Federal highways (Route 1 and State Road 5), acquired from Swedish immigrants Olai and Sarah Gudmundsen.

The initial name of the area&#x27;s first post office was Jewel (sometimes spelled Jewell), which served the few residences between Lantana and West Palm Beach. Between 1889 and 1903, Fannie James served as postmaster of the post office, located in a small dry goods shop, which the couple operated to serve the lake traffic that connected the small pioneer homesteads located along the banks of the Lake Worth Lagoon. Area pioneers also reported that Jewell was included as a stop on the route of the barefoot mailman via the Celestial Railroad by July 1889.

Beginning in the 1890s, the Jameses sold off most of their acreage in a number of parcels ranging in size from to new residents and investors. After Samuel&#x27;s death in 1909, Fannie sold her remaining to the developer, Palm Beach Farms Company, keeping only a 1.25 acre (0.51 ha) farmette, which lay outside the new city limits as required by the segregation provisions of the 1913 town of Lake Worth charter.

After Henry Flagler extended the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) south from West Palm Beach to Miami in 1896, a land development scheme was created to plant a townsite between the railroad and the lake. Purchasers of agricultural lots, most of which were located in modern-day Greenacres, would also receive a small lot within the city of Lake Worth. The developer, Bryant &amp; Greenwood, promoted the area to markets across the United States and Canada. They proposed to name the town Lucerne, but the United States Postal Service refused to accept the name because there already was a Lucerne post office, now a neighborhood in Miami Gardens. Therefore, the city founders changed the new town&#x27;s name to Lake Worth.

In April 1911, &quot;A solitary Indian mound surrounded by wild woods marked the spot where flourishing Lake Worth is now growing beyond the most vivid imagination&quot;, according to a promotional article published in the &quot;Lake Worth Herald&quot;. The population of the nascent city stood at 38 in July 1912.

During that year, the library, schoolhouse, newspaper, Women&#x27;s Club, Chamber of Commerce, first church, and first railroad station (operated by the FEC at Lake Avenue) were established. The town&#x27;s first census in December 1912 indicated that there were &quot;308 residents, 125 houses, 10 wagons, seven automobiles, 36 bicycles and 876 fowls.&quot; Additionally, from 1911 to 1912, the Palm Beach Farms Company platted approximately 7,000 residential lots and constructed some of roads, including Lake Avenue, a major thoroughfare.

===Incorporation to the Great Depression===
Lake Worth Beach was incorporated as the &quot;town of Lake Worth&quot; on June 14, 1913. Its first elected Mayor was James Love, a carpenter and member of the Socialist Party of America. The town grew rapidly enough that a new addition was platted in that inaugural year. The area along the Intracoastal Waterway from 5th Avenue South to 15th Avenue South still bears the name &quot;Addition 1.&quot; An advertisement in the &quot;Lake Worth Herald&quot; in 1913 noted: &quot;In the new addition, the Lake front has been divided into large lots covered with palm and tropical growth, where we expect to see charming villas and winter homes spring up as by enchantment. It will be the fashionable part of town, where the wealthy of the earth can display their artistic taste and make ideal homes. These lots are selling so fast that but very few are left.&quot; Another section of the town was plotted in 1917, the Osborne Colored Addition, a small African American neighborhood along the south end of Lake Worth and west of the FEC. Some of the first African American families arrived in the addition in the early 1920s, when the Ku Klux Klan forced them out of western Lantana.

Two years after the addition was platted, a wooden automobile traffic bridge over Lake Worth was completed in 1919, the same year the Brelsford family of Palm Beach deeded a parcel of land on the barrier island to the town. 

The town benefited with the rest of South Florida during the Florida land boom of the 1920s, with Lake Worth&#x27;s population more than quintupling from 1,106 in 1920 to nearly 6,000 in 1930. Following the approval of a $100,000 bond issue in 1920, the Mediterranean Revival-style Lake Worth Casino and Baths was constructed. Opening two years later, the casino drew many tourists to the area.

Moreover, the 1920s saw the completion of the Gulf Stream Hotel, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), as well as the construction of Lake Worth Community High School in 1922 and many commercial and industrial buildings and neighborhoods, including College Park and Lake Worth Heights in 1924. Lake Worth reincorporated as a city in 1925, while boundaries of the municipality expanded several times throughout the land boom. One year later, the Seaboard Air Line Railway constructed a freight and passenger depot in Lake Worth on 4th Avenue North.

William A. Boutwell arrived in the area in the 1920s. He established Boutwell Dairy in 1927 and managed the company until retiring in 1956. Boutwell is credited with inventing half &amp; half creamer; the dairy later merged with Alfar Creamery and then T.G. Lee, who distributed the product more widely until it became an American diner staple. Boutwell also owned a grocery store and masonry supply store. Furthermore, he served as a Lake Worth city commissioner from 1924 to 1927 and briefly as vice mayor. During his tenure, the city constructed approximately of roads and two elementary schools, including the still active South Grade Elementary School.

The 1928 Okeechobee hurricane devastated Lake Worth. A survey indicated that the storm demolished about 600 homes and damaged 1,500 others, leaving about 700 people homeless. Fewer than 10% of homes escaped damage. Approximately 50 businesses were wrecked and 200 others received damage – roughly 75% of buildings in the business district. The storm demolished or severely damaged many buildings, including First Presbyterian Church, St. Andrew&#x27;s Episcopal Church, the Oakley Theater, the Gulf Stream Hotel, the Scottish Rites Cathedral, the Masonic Temple, the Florida Hotel, a car dealership, a sporting goods store, an investment company, the Old Lake Worth City Hall, and an auditorium at Lake Worth Community High School. Additionally, the bridge across the Intracoastal Waterway was virtually destroyed. The hurricane caused approximately $4 million worth of damages in Lake Worth, as well as three deaths.

In the immediate aftermath of the storm, the Gulf Stream Hotel was converted to a makeshift hospital. The devastation left Lake Worth without a functional center for city government, although records were mostly unscathed. Consequently, a temporary city hall was established at the Lauriston building. The storm, combined with the Great Depression led to a severe economic decline within the community. Construction projects primarily shifted to repairing damaged buildings. However, there were a few conservation, construction, and New Deal projects during the 1930s. This included when President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Works Progress Administration built the striking, Moorish-styled &quot;city gymnasium&quot; on the corner of Lake Avenue and Dixie Highway. The building today serves as the Lake Worth Beach City Hall.

===World War II to present===
Although no military installations were located in Lake Worth, the presence of military bases and repair facilities in nearby towns led to a significant increase in the city&#x27;s population during World War II, from 7,406 in 1940 to 10,615 about five years later. Development started again after World War II, especially due to the approval of the G.I. Bill, allowing new homes to become affordable. Many veterans who trained in South Florida also returned to the area, leading to a population boom. The city also saw a wave of immigrants, especially from Finland. These Finnish immigrants established three churches in Lake Worth to preserve their heritage while also benefiting the local economy, which returned to a state of stability in the post-war years.

Two hurricanes impacted Lake Worth later in the 1940s, one in 1947 and the other in 1949. Although the former damaged nearly all businesses and about half of homes, few structures suffered serious damage. However, among the structures experiencing substantial impact was the Lake Worth Casino, which was repaired and reopened in the 1950s with a shoebox style architectural design. Although the 1949 hurricane made landfall in Lake Worth, the cyclone caused less impact than the 1947 storm. Around 300–400 homes were damaged, with one destroyed, while the storm deroofed many homes in the Osborne Colored Addition. Winds also destroyed a filling station and shattered many windows at downtown businesses.

In 1954, a concrete wall was erected at the Osborne Colored Addition to separate it from the white Whispering Palms neighborhood. Although the city officially integrated in 1969, the neighborhood retained the name Osborne Colored Addition until 1994. Today, the remnants of the wall is referred to as the Unity Wall and is instead used for murals. Despite the &quot;Brown vs. Board of Education&quot; decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1954, Palm Beach County schools only slowly integrated. John Green and Theresa Jakes Kanu became among the first black students to attend a formerly whites-only high school in Palm Beach County when they arrived at Lake Worth High Community High School in 1961. Little further progress on the racial integration of schools in the county occurred until a court order in 1970.

The 1960s and 1970s also brought the construction of many apartments, condominiums, and larger commercial buildings, which often resulted in the demolition of older structures. During a period of neglect and decline between the 1970s and 1990s, Lake Worth, in the words of then-city commissioner Dennis Dorsey, &quot;had become known as the skin-flick capital of the country&quot;. The venue now known as the Lake Worth Playhouse was the Playtoy, and was well known in Palm Beach County as the theater that showed X-rated movies; &quot;Deep Throat&quot; was shown there, motivating a police raid in the 1970s. The decade also saw the construction of the current bridge across the Intracoastal Waterway. Opening in 1973, the Robert A. Harris Bridge is two lanes wider and higher than the previous bridge, built in 1938. Also during 1973, the Lake Worth City Hall moved from 414 Lake Avenue to 7 North Dixie Highway, its current location. The building at the former address has been listed in the NRHP since 1989 and is also often referred to as City Hall Annex.

Foreign political turmoil and the South Florida construction boom have brought another wave of immigrants from Central America and the Caribbean, especially since the 1980s. Included in the immigration wave of that decade were many Guatemalan-Mayans, who consider themselves indigenous people rather than &quot;Hispanic&quot; or &quot;Latino&quot;, and some may not speak Spanish. Many Guatemalan-Maya people migrated to Lake Worth Beach to seek refuge from the Guatemalan genocide being committed against the indigenous Maya people in Guatemala, often referred to as the Silent Holocaust. The Maya mostly converse in Mam, Q&#x27;anjob&#x27;al, or any one of 22 existing Mayan languages spoken in Guatemala. Adding to the racial and linguistic mix of the city is a large Haitian population, many of whom speak Creole. Most immigrants from Haiti have also arrived in the United States since the early 1980s.

The downtown area underwent restoration efforts in the late 1990s. The Florida Department of Transportation spent $3.9 million to improve sidewalks and streets, while the city of Lake Worth contributed over $670,000 for benches, landscaping, planters, trash cans, and new lights and sidewalk pavers. As a result, downtown property values increased in 1997 for the first time since the late 1980s. The area then saw a huge resurgence in interest and now sports an array of art galleries, sidewalk cafés, and night clubs. The city&#x27;s main street, Lake Avenue, contains some of the oldest commercial structures in South Florida. Lake Avenue, along with the parallel street of Lucerne Avenue, include most of the structures constituting the Historic Old Town Commercial District, which has been listed in the NRHP since 2001.

Later in the 2000s decade, the city was hit especially hard by hurricanes Frances and Jeanne in 2004 and Wilma in 2005. Wilma alone destroyed 27 homes and 7 businesses and damaged 2,491 homes and 93 businesses to some degree. Damage to businesses, government properties, and residences combined from Wilma totaled approximately $28.3 million. The William O. Lockhart Municipal Pier, constructed in 1954, suffered significant damage from the hurricanes, especially due to Frances and Jeanne, requiring $3.4 million to be repaired. The pier is home to a tide gauge with a sporadic history, showing an above average rate of sea level rise.

In 2015, the city was accused of asking for business licenses from surrounding churches. Then-City Manager Michael Bornstein described the controversy as a &quot;dust-up&quot; that became politicized, while the accuser, Pastor Mike Olive of Common Ground Church, later stated that the &quot;problems are behind us now.&quot;

A ballot initiative to change the name of the city to Lake Worth Beach in 2019, passed by a narrow margin. The city stated that the name change &quot;will be implemented slowly&quot;. One of the main reasons cited for the proposal was to distinguish the city from its suburbs to the west, which have a reputation for higher crime rates. Another factor motivating support for the name change was that tourism could increase as the city would have an opportunity to rebrand itself as a beach town.

The city government became embroiled in another controversy that garnered national headlines in March 2020. Then-Mayor Pam Triolo and then-Lake Worth Beach Commissioner Omari Hardy became involved in a heated discussion over the potential for shutting off electrical services due to non-payment in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. In response, the city government allowed electrical service to residents to remain uninterrupted for the next few months, with or without payment, before city commissioners unanimously voted to resume power shutoffs in July 2020.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (13.51%) is water.

Several geographical features in Palm Beach County somewhat confusingly share the name &quot;Lake Worth.&quot; The city of Lake Worth Beach is named after a lagoon which is officially known as the Lake Worth Lagoon. This lagoon opens to the Atlantic Ocean at the Port of Palm Beach via the Lake Worth Inlet. The next closest inlet exists farther south in Boynton Beach. The port and two inlets are all distant from the actual city of Lake Worth Beach. The lake is a long channel that spans much of east-central and northeastern Palm Beach County; indeed, the Intracoastal Waterway traverses the length of the lagoon. The manmade inlets to the ocean have replaced the natural freshwater with saltwater, such that the lagoon is actually now an estuary, instead of a true lagoon.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mapped most of Lake Worth Beach in the Southern Florida Flatwoods land resource area. Deep, poorly drained acidic sandy soils are typical for the area; they have gray topsoil, white subsoil, and a dark hardpan. Much of Lake Worth Beach is built on a rapidly drained white or gray sand which is too dry and infertile to support vigorous plant growth. The western outskirts of Lake Worth Beach are in the Southern Florida Lowlands area. Topsoils there are sandy, but the subsoils have a much higher content of clay and the soils are relatively fertile. As in the flatwoods, these soils are poorly drained for many purposes unless drainage systems are installed.

Although the incorporated city of Lake Worth Beach is small geographically, as is common in Palm Beach County, a large unincorporated urbanized area with a Lake Worth postal address lies to the west of the city. Only two zip codes are within the city&#x27;s boundaries, 33460 and the eastern edge of 33641, while 33449, the remainder of 33461, 33462, 33463, and 33467 zip codes are located outside the city limits but may use a Lake Worth mailing address. Thus, &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot; noted in 2019 that there are more mailing addresses for Lake Worth (unincorporated area) than Lake Worth Beach (the proper, incorporated area).

===Climate===

Lake Worth Beach has a tropical climate, similar to the climate found in much of the Caribbean. It is part of the only region in the 48 contiguous states that falls under that category. More specifically, it generally has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification, &quot;Am&quot;).

===Cityscape and neighborhoods===

The Lake Worth Beach Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) maintains the Neighborhood Association President&#x27;s Council (NAPC). The three purposes of the NAPC, according to the Lake Worth Beach CRA, is to improve representation of diversity in the city&#x27;s neighborhoods, to maintain open communications between city government and neighborhood associations, and to promote volunteering to assist needy areas.

A total of 17 neighborhood associations are recognized by the Lake Worth Beach CRA, including:
*Bryant Park, bounded by the Intracoastal Waterway to the east, Lucerne Avenue to the north, South Federal Highway to the west, and 5th Avenue South to the south; also includes the Lake Worth Municipal Beach
*College Park, bounded by the Intracoastal Waterway to the east, West Palm Beach to its north, Dixie Highway to the west, and Wellesley Drive to the south 
*Downtown Jewel (Downtown Lake Worth Beach), bounded by South Federal Highway to the east, Lucerne Avenue to the north, South Dixie Highway to the west, and 6th Avenue South to the south, and has Old Town within its border
*Eden Place, bounded by the Intracoastal Waterway to the east, Wellesley Drive to the north, Dixie Highway to the west, and 13th Avenue North to the south

*Vernon Heights, located near the northwest corner of Lake Worth Beach
*Whispering Palms, bounded by South Dixie Highway to the east, 12th Avenue South to the north, Interstate 95 to the west, and Lantana to the south
The College Park and Old Lucerne (Parrot Cove) neighborhoods are notable for being historic districts listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The former is a neighborhood in which most of the homes were constructed 1925 and 1949. Of the 123 residences in College Park, 90 residences are classified as contributing and the remaining 33 others classified as non-contributing, with a majority of those constructed after 1949. The Old Lucerne Historic Residential District is the section of Lake Worth Beach where Samuel and Fannie James lived. A total of 346 structures are located in the district, with 218 classified as contributing and 128 are classified as non-contributing. The contributing structures were constructed from as early as about 1913 to 1951.

====Downtown====

The Historic Old Town Commercial District, listed in the NRHP in 2001, encompasses much of downtown Lake Worth Beach. A total of 59 buildings are part of the roughly 16-acre (6.5 ha) area, which stretches westward to the Florida East Coast Railroad (adjacent to G Street), eastward to M Street, northward to Lucerne Avenue, and southward to 1st Avenue South. It is distinguished by its two main streets, the east-to-west Lake Avenue and Lucerne Avenue, while Dixie Highway is a major north-south thoroughfare through the district. Of the 59 structures listed as part of the historic commercial district, 46 are classified as contributing and the other 13 are considered non-contributing. The contributing buildings, constructed between 1912 and 1949, are generally of Masonry Vernacular-style architecture, although Art Deco, Mediterranean Revival, and Moorish Revival styles are also present.

Lake Worth Beach&#x27;s downtown area has a distinct character and is a popular destination for both tourists and residents of South Florida. Several of the city&#x27;s notable buildings are located in this section, including the current City Hall, former City Hall (NRHP-listed in 1989 and includes the Lake Worth Historical Museum), Lake Worth Beach Post Office, Lake Worth Playhouse, Lake Worth Beach Public Library, and Park Theater, although not all of these structures are listed as part of the Historic Old Town Commercial District.

==Demographics==

In terms of population, Lake Worth Beach ranked as the ninth largest city in Palm Beach County, with 42,219 residents according to the 2020 census. Lake Worth Beach is considered one of the most ethnically and racially diverse cities in Palm Beach County. Less than a majority of residents identify as non-Hispanic white, while Hispanic whites represented a plurality of the population in 2019. Additionally, as of 2021, approximately 38.7% of residents were born outside of the United States, many of whom immigrated from the Caribbean or Latin America, and just 44.9% of people in Lake Worth Beach only spoke English.

Since 2001, the CRA area has included the entirety of Dixie Highway and areas in the vicinity of 6th Avenue South and 10th Avenue North. The downtown area also saw a resurgence in the late 1990s, with many art galleries, sidewalk cafés, and night clubs lining its streets. LULA Lake Worth Arts lists many of these downtown businesses on its Dynamic Walker&#x27;s Map.

The Gulf Stream Hotel, which has been closed to the public since 2005, has been proposed for renovation in order to reopen it, which voters strongly approved by a margin of 81.82% – 18.18% in March 2020.

Restoration St. Louis agreed to spend at least $100 million on both projects, while the city agreed to fund infrastructure improvements around the hotel, with expenditures ranging from $1 million to possibly up to $3.6 million.

==Government==
The city uses the commission–manager form of government. Lake Worth Beach has a five-member city commission. These members are elected to staggered, three-year terms, running on nonpartisan candidacies in different districts. The city commission acts in a legislative manner, approving motions, ordinances, and resolutions. The mayor, who presides over the city commission, also serves in three-year terms, but is elected by voters citywide. As outlined by the city charter, these elections are to be held on the second Tuesday in March, while runoffs are to be held two weeks later if a candidate fails to achieve a majority of the votes. Betty Resch has served as mayor since March 16, 2021. The Lake Worth Beach city clerk is tasked with maintaining official city records. This office is currently held by Melissa Ann Coyne. Another key Lake Worth Beach official is the city manager, who is responsible for the administrative functions of city government. Carmen Davis, who previously served as county administrator of Hinds County, Mississippi, from 2010 to 2019 and a city planner for Detroit from 1993 to 2009, is the current city manager of Lake Worth Beach.

Lake Worth Beach is part of Florida&#x27;s 21st congressional district, which has been represented by Lois Frankel (D) since 2017. Four different Florida House of Representatives districts cover portions of Lake Worth Beach – the 87th, 88th, 89th, and 90th districts, which are represented by David Silvers (D), Jervonte Edmonds (D), Mike Caruso (R), and Joseph Casello (D), respectively. The entire city is located within the Florida Senate&#x27;s 24th district, which includes parts of east-central Palm Beach County and is currently represented by Bobby Powell (D). Much of Lake Worth Beach is within the 3rd district for the Palm Beach County Board of County Commissioners, while the municipal beach section and areas south of 6th Avenue South and east of Interstate 95 are within the 7th district. The former is represented by Dave Kerner and the latter is represented by Mack Bernard.

Overall, the city has a liberal partisan lean. Of the 17,738 registered voters as of December 2021, 8,552 were members of the Democratic Party, 5,290 had no party affiliation, 3,471 were members of the Republican Party, and 425 were members of a minor party. Decades earlier, the city and Palm Beach County were both reliably right-leaning, with the latter voting for the Republican Party nominee for president of the United States in each election from 1948 to 1988. In 2020, Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump in all of the city&#x27;s precincts and in most by a margin of at least 20%, while the county supported Biden by a margin of just under 12.8%. &quot;Lake Worth Herald&quot; president Mark Easton, a lifelong resident of the city, noted that he had observed the partisan lean of Lake Worth Beach shift rapidly from highly conservative to highly liberal. Easton remarked that due to diversity, &quot;You would think that it would meld Lake Worth into a more middle-of-the-road atmosphere: Never happens. It always stays polarized&quot;.

==LGBT sanctuary city==

In September 2023, the city formally by declaration unanimously became an &quot;LGBT sanctuary city&quot; to protect and defend LGBT rights.

==Culture==

===Arts===

The Cultural Council for Palm Beach County, founded by Alexander W. Dreyfoos Jr. as the Palm Beach County Council of the Arts in West Palm Beach in 1978, evolved into the official county government agency to support and promote local arts and culture. In 2012, the organization relocated from West Palm Beach to the Robert M. Montgomery Jr. Building in Lake Worth Beach and renovated the building with the assistance of the Lake Worth Beach CRA. This building was formerly the 1,000 seat Lake Theatre, which opened at 601 Lake Avenue in 1940, constructed at a cost of $75,000. The Cultural Council for Palm Beach County hosts many cultural events at its headquarters and elsewhere in Palm Beach County.

Several art galleries are located in downtown Lake Worth Beach. These include the Art Link International, Artisans on the Ave, Benzaiten, Bruce Konder Galleries, Flamingo Gallery, HATCH 1121, No So So, and Palm Beach Gallery. The Cultural Council for Palm Beach County also lists art organizations and facilities such as the Armory Arts Center, Bamboo Room, Book Cellar, Downtown Dance, Lake Worth Art League, Lake Worth Playhouse, Lake Worth Public Library, Social House, and Urban Arts Lofts. The Lake Worth Playhouse was founded in 1953. The building it is housed in originally opened in 1929 as the Oakley Theatre, which had previously been virtually demolished by the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane. However, the Oakley Theatre quickly went into bankruptcy due to the Great Depression. Today, the Lake Worth Playhouse hosts a number of year-round events, including ballets, dramas, foreign and independent films, musicals, and operas.
===Festivals===

Lake Worth Beach features several annual festivals. The Lake Worth Beach Street Painting Festival attracts about 100,000 people to the downtown area, where more than 600 artists create works on the asphalt along Lake Avenue and Lucerne Avenue. Similarly, FOCUS Lake Worth features displays of multidisciplinary art at different mural locations in downtown in the month of November. Midnight Sun Festival, originally called Finlandia Days, is an event celebrating Lake Worth Beach&#x27;s Finnish population and has been held annually at Bryant Park since 1983. When combined with neighboring Lantana&#x27;s Finnish community, it becomes one of the largest Finnish communities in the United States. One of the largest Oktoberfest events in South Florida is held every October just outside the city at the American German Club of the Palm Beaches on Lantana Road, while Mathews Brewing Company in Lake Worth Beach also observes Oktoberfest. In late October, a Día de los Muertos event is also held in the downtown area.

The annual Palm Beach Pride parade is held in Lake Worth Beach. According to Discover The Palm Beaches, over 30,000 people attend the event, which is one of the largest pride parades in Florida and the oldest active in the state. Lake Worth Beach also has the county&#x27;s only LGBT community center, Compass, and the gay bar Mad Hatter Lounge. The City Tree Board organizes an annual &quot;Lake Worth Festival of Trees&quot;, while a monthly celebration called &quot;Lake Ave Block Party&quot; takes place in the Cultural Plaza, next to the City Hall Annex. The city hosts bonfires at the Lake Worth Beach Casino and Beach Complex on the second and fourth Fridays from November to February. Additionally, the city government, in conjunction with several local businesses and organizations, holds ceremonies and parades for other commonly recognized holidays.

===Cinematography===

A substantial portion of the 1981 movie, &quot;Body Heat&quot;, starring William Hurt and Kathleen Turner, was filmed in downtown Lake Worth Beach. The city became the fictitious town of Miranda Beach. In the movie, the building at 813 Lucerne Avenue became Stella&#x27;s Coffee Shop, Lake Worth City Hall became Miranda Beach City Hall, and the building at 811 Lake Avenue became Ned&#x27;s office, while the film also showed the French restaurant L&#x27;Anjou (now Los Panchos Tacos &amp; Tequila Bar). Former Congressman Mark Foley appeared as an extra in the film. Three years later, the 1984 movie &quot;Harry &amp; Son&quot; was also filmed in Lake Worth Beach.
===Historical preservation===

The Lake Worth Historical Museum is located on the second floor of the old Lake Worth City Hall, which functioned as the city&#x27;s administrative center from the 1920s to 1973. Additionally, the Historical Society of Lake Worth is located at the public library. Substantial efforts by the city to preserve historic structures and districts dates back to an ordinance approved by the city commission in 1996. In 2017, the Lake Worth Beach Department of Community Sustainability and Division of Planning, Zoning and Historic Preservation; the Historic Resources Preservation Board; and the Historical Society of Lake Worth designated seven homes constructed in 1912 as historical properties, identified as the oldest residences in the city without major alterations. Additionally, between 1913 and 1949, many cottages were constructed. According to the 2016 book &quot;Cottages of Lake Worth Beach - Living Large in Small Spaces&quot;, approximately 1,000 cottages remain, constituting the largest concentration of this type of dwelling in Florida.

The Lake Worth Beach government considers six areas to be historic districts: College Park, Northeast Lucerne, Old Lucerne, Old Town, Southeast Lucerne, and South Palm Park. Moreover, the federal NRHP lists three historic districts and three historic structures in Lake Worth Beach. The historic districts listed are College Park, Old Lucerne, and Old Town, while the structures listed are the Gulf Stream Hotel, Old Lake Worth City Hall, and Osborne School. Additionally, the Osborne School is also listed in Florida&#x27;s Historic Black Public Schools Multiple Property Submission.

==Education==

Public schools in Lake Worth Beach are part of the School District of Palm Beach County. Elementary school students are served by four public schools, all located within the boundaries of Lake Worth Beach – Barton Elementary, Highland Elementary, North Grade Elementary, and South Grade Elementary. Middle school students north of 12th Avenue South attend Lake Worth Middle School, while those living south of 12th Avenue South attend Lantana Community Middle School in Lantana. All public high school students in the city are assigned to Lake Worth Community High School. Established in 1922, it is the oldest continuously operating high school in Palm Beach County.

Sacred Heart Catholic Church operates a separate private school (pre-K–8) in Lake Worth Beach. There is also a charter school in the city, the Academy for Positive Learning.

Additionally, within the city&#x27;s boundaries is the former Osborne School, also known as Osborne Elementary School. Constructed in 1948, the school served black elementary students in the formerly segregated Osborne neighborhood until 1971. Subsequently, busing policies implemented in the early 1970s left the Osborne School vacant. Since 2003, the school building has been listed in both the NRHP and Florida&#x27;s Historic Black Public Schools Multiple Property Submission.

The main campus of Palm Beach State College is located in unincorporated Lake Worth. It is the oldest community college in Florida, founded in 1933 as Palm Beach Junior College. It was at one time located on the campus of Palm Beach High School, at the present day Dreyfoos School of the Arts in downtown West Palm Beach. The school moved to its present location in 1956. The name was changed to Palm Beach Community College in 1988 and later renamed Palm Beach State College in 2010 to reflect that the school was offering four-year degrees.

===Public libraries===
The Lake Worth Beach Public Library, located in the historic downtown area at 15 North M Street, is a Mediterranean-style architectural building, completed in 1941 at a cost of $66,000, an amount raised by the Lake Worth Library Association. A dedicatory service was held on August 12, 1941. It is a part of the Library Cooperative of the Palm Beaches. Annually, the library circulates approximately 65,000 items, including 57,468 books.

Efforts to organize a library date back to 1912, one year prior to the city&#x27;s incorporation. Residents saw the need for a library and requested book donations via an advertisement in the &quot;Lucerne Herald&quot; newspaper in May 1912. R.D. Strong and John L. McKissock then established the Lake Worth Library Association on November 30. For several years, the library was housed inside a reading room located in City Hall. Although residents voted to officially establish the Lake Worth Public Library and allot $6,000 for the construction of a building in 1926, the funds remained insufficient.

Congress approved a bill allotting $60,000 to construct a building bearing the name Major General William Jenkins Worth Memorial Library in 1939, nearly 100 years after the body of water was named in his honor. However, after President Franklin D. Roosevelt vetoed the bill, the residents of the community continued raising funds until the building was finally completed in 1941. James and William Strait also contributed $10,000 for an art museum wing, which is now the children&#x27;s section. The library also houses noted artist R. Sherman Winton&#x27;s only known collection, which features historical Florida themes of the Spanish period, as well as wood carvings by Sam J. Schlappich, a local artist who was featured in the Century of Progress Fair in 1933 and the World&#x27;s Fair in 1939.

In addition to the Lake Worth Beach Public Library, the city has more than 100 Little Free Library book exchanges as of late 2020. The construction and maintenance of the Little Free Libraries began due to the efforts of resident Mary Lindsey and over 120 voluneeters. By December 2020, the Little Free Library system in Lake Worth Beach had distributed approximately 500,000 books.

==Recreation==
The city&#x27;s municipal beach is one of Southeast Florida&#x27;s few remaining large areas of open, public space along the ocean. In 2013, the Lake Worth Casino complex reopened following a two-year, $6 million renovation. The neoclassical building approximates the original 1920s casino building, which served as a gambling establishment until the 1930s and had stood overlooking the ocean until it was replaced by a more modern, boxy building after the 1947 hurricane. Near the casino is the William O. Lockhart Municipal Pier, a popular landmark in Lake Worth Beach. Following Hurricane Frances in 2004, the pier was repaired and raised . The structure of the pier and wave action result in the creation of sandbars, which, according to the Lake Worth CRA, causes the pier to &quot;provide the most consistent surf in South Florida&quot;.

The Snook Islands Natural Area, located on the west shore of the Intracoastal Waterway just north of the bridge, is a 118-acre (48 hectarce) wetland restoration area that includes a boardwalk, floating dock, and kayak launch. The nearby municipal golf course includes 18-holes with a view across the Intracoastal Waterway. Bryant Park, located in downtown Lake Worth Beach, has an Addison Mizner-designed 1930s bandshell, which is used for festivals and other events. Overall, Lake Worth Beach has more than 20 recreational facilities and municipal parks. On the west side of the city, the county-owned John Prince Memorial Park follows the winding shores of Lake Osborne and offers several miles of bike and walking trails as well as hundreds of acres for picnicking, volleyball, and overnight camping.

==Media==

The &quot;Lake Worth Herald and Coastal/Greenacres Observer&quot; is a weekly newspaper based in the city. In addition to publishing news about Lake Worth Beach, the paper also reports on local stories in Greenacres, Hypoluxo, Lake Clarke Shores, Lantana, Manalapan, Palm Springs, and South Palm Beach.
 The &quot;Lake Worth Herald&quot; began publication in 1912 as the &quot;Lucerne Herald&quot; and is considered the city&#x27;s oldest business, while the &quot;Coastal/Greenacres Observer&quot; is a sister publication founded in 1969. Lake Worth Beach, as well as Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast, are also served daily by &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot;, founded in 1909 as the weekly &quot;Palm Beach County&quot;, which had the fifth largest circulation for a newspaper in Florida as of November 2017.

Lake Worth Beach is part of the West Palm Beach–Fort Pierce television market, ranked as the 38th largest in the United States by Nielsen Media Research. The market is served by stations affiliated with major American networks including WPTV-TV/5 (NBC), WPEC/12 (CBS), WPBF/25 (ABC), WFLX/29 (FOX), WTVX/34 (CW), WXEL-TV/42 (PBS), WTCN-CD/43 (MYTV), WWHB-CD/48 (Azteca), WHDT/59 (Court TV), WFGC/61 (CTN), WPXP-TV/67 (ION), as well as local channel WBWP-LD/57 (Ind.).

Many radio stations are located within range of the city. Radio station WWRF, an AM Regional Mexican station, is based in Lake Worth Beach.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
Interstate 95 runs north-to-south along the west side of the city, with two ramps in Lake Worth Beach, one at 10th Avenue North and the other at 6th Avenue South. Several highways traverse the city. U.S. Route 1 (Dixie Highway) and state roads 5 (North Federal Highway) and A1A run north-to-south in Lake Worth Beach, while State Road 802 (Lake Worth Road, Lake Avenue, and Lucerne Avenue) runs east-to-west. The Robert A. Harris Bridge, constructed in 1973, links Lake Worth Beach to its municipal beach section, crossing the Intracoastal Waterway (Lake Worth Lagoon) at State Road 802. Palm Beach International Airport is the nearest commercial airport, located in neighboring West Palm Beach, while the public-use Palm Beach County Park Airport is situated just southwest of the city.

The Tri-Rail commuter rail system serves the city at the Lake Worth Beach station, which opened in 1989. Tri-Rail connects Lake Worth Beach to other cities in eastern Palm Beach County and to Broward and Miami-Dade counties. It is also served by PalmTran buses. This includes Route 1, which runs northward and southward along Dixie Highway; Route 61, which runs along 10th Avenue North to Dixie Highway to Lucerne Avenue and reaches Palm Beach State College before reversing its course (going eastward along Lake Avenue); Route 62, which runs eastward along Lake Worth Road and Lake Avenue to the municipal beach and then reverses course along Lucerne Avenue; and Route 64, which runs eastward along 6th Avenue South to Dixie Highway, then southward to 12th Avenue South, and finally southward along Barton Road and Andrew Redding Road before reversing course at the Lantana Lake Worth Health Center in Lantana.

===Emergency services===

Lake Worth Beach previously operated its own fire department from 1913 until 2009, when firefighters voted to merge with Palm Beach County Fire Rescue (PBCFR). Among the supporting factors in the merger were cost-saving measures for the city and better career advancement opportunities for firefighters. PBCFR has two stations within the city&#x27;s boundaries, Station 91 at 1020 Lucerne Avenue (Battalion 3 headquarters) and Station 93 at 1229 Detroit Street. In order to prepare for, mitigate, and recover from emergencies and disasters, Lake Worth Beach&#x27;s Emergency Management Program has established the Emergency Management team. Parts of the city are located within Evacuation Zone C, which is ordered to evacuate when a Category 3 hurricane (or stronger) threatens the area. The nearest hospital is the JFK Medical Center in Atlantis.

Lake Worth Beach has a local reputation for high crime and has been counted as among the highest crime cities in the state. Partially due to this, city commissioners narrowly voted to disband the Lake Worth Police Department in 2008, with law enforcement duties being taken over by the Palm Beach County Sheriff&#x27;s Office (PBSO). At the time, the municipal police department employed 91 sworn officers. Crime initially fell in the years following the merger, with murders down 73%, robberies down 47%, and burglaries down 23% from the period of 2007 to 2014. Violent crime rates then dropped by double-digit percentages for three consecutive years, 2016–2018. However, in 2019, the violent crime rate increased by 5.2% from the previous year. Much of the rise was attributable to an increase in aggravated assaults, although the city reported a decrease in burglaries and rapes. Today, PBSO maintains a police substation at 120 North G Street as part of their 14th district, which encompasses the municipal boundaries of Lake Worth Beach and has 82 deputies and 12 civilian employees.

In addition to high crime rates, the city was part of the worsening opioid epidemic in the United States. From 2015 to 2016, the number of suspected drug overdose deaths rose by 56%. As of 2016, the estimated rate of overdose deaths was 20 out of every 10,000 people, higher than in neighboring towns. Overdose rates began decreasing in the late 2010s. PBSO reported 301 overdoses in Lake Worth Beach between May 2019 and April 2020, down from 354 between May 2018 and April 2019.

===Utilities===

In contrast with many other localities in eastern Florida, who are usually served by Florida Power &amp; Light, Lake Worth Beach operates its own electrical utility. Founded in 1914 as the &quot;Lake Worth Water, Light, and Ice Company&quot; to serve about 600 residents, Lake Worth Beach Electric Utility has approximately 27,000 customers as of 2019. This also includes about 7,200 customers in Palm Springs and some adjacent unincorporated areas of Palm Beach County. In an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the city purchased and began operating a solar farm in 2017, becoming the first municipality in Florida to do so. By May 2021, more than 38% of power generated by Lake Worth Beach Electric Utility originated from solar energy. Citizen Owned Energy forecasts that greenhouse gas emissions generated by the Lake Worth Beach Electric Utility will decrease to less than half of its 2005 levels by 2024.

The Lake Worth Beach Water Utilities Department is responsible for providing residents with drinking water and the collection of wastewater and stormwater. Drinking water originates at a water treatment plant and is distributed via about of pipelines across the city. Lake Worth Beach owns and operates 33 pump stations, along with roughly of gravity and pressure pipes. Additionally, the city owns and maintains a master pump station, which also collects wastewater from Atlantis, Lake Clarke Shores, Manalapan, Palm Beach State College, South Palm Beach, and Palm Spring. This wastewater is then sent to the East Central Regional Water Reclamation Facility for treatment. Stormwater is collected via 46 outfalls, which drain into the Lake Worth Lagoon.

<text>Lantana is a town in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States. It is north from Fort Lauderdale and north of Miami. This town is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. The population was 11,504 at the 2020 United States Census.

==History==

The first settlers came to the area after Congress passed the &quot;Armed Occupation Act of 1842&quot; at the end of the Seminole Wars during the Administration of President John Tyler. The M.B. Lyman family is credited with founding the town. Lyman arrived with his family in 1888 and within a year started several enterprises including a general store, Indian Trading Post and a post office. As postmaster, Lyman named the post office – &quot;Lantana Point&quot; – for the wild Lantana plants that grew in abundance in the area. The word &quot;Point&quot; was later dropped.

One of the other Lyman businesses was the Lantana Fish Company. In the early 1900s the gathering and marketing of oysters became the town&#x27;s leading industry. The Town of Lantana was incorporated on July 20, 1921, with 22 residents voting in the first election. At the time of incorporation, the area of Lantana was one square mile with a population of 100 residents.

After World War II, Lantana, like the rest of South Florida experienced a tremendous building boom which continues to this day. Interstate 95, which was completed through Lantana in the mid-1970s, brought a surge of commercial development to the town.

Since 1950, the town was the home of the A. G. Holley Hospital the last of the old state-run sanitariums for patients with tuberculosis. The facility treated about fifty patients at a time, those with the most obdurate forms of the disease. The facility was demolished in November 2014.

From 1974 until 1988, Lantana was home to the tradition of hosting the largest decorated Christmas tree in the world. Every year, a huge tree would be shipped from the Pacific Northwest to Lantana by rail to the grounds of the National Enquirer, adjacent to the Florida East Coast Railway tracks. The event would attract many visitors every night, and grew to be one of the most spectacular and celebrated holiday events in South Florida. This annual festivity ended in 1989 due to the sale of the National Enquirer following the death of its founder Generoso Pope Jr. at age of 61 in October 1988.

==Geography==

Lantana is located at (26.582797, –80.057587).

Lantana has a tropical climate, more specifically a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Af&quot;), as its driest month (February) averages 64.8mm of precipitation, meeting the minimum standard of 60mm in the driest month needed to qualify for that designation. Much of the year is warm to hot in Lantana, and frost is extremely rare. As is typical in the Miami metropolitan area, there are two basic seasons in Lantana, a mild and dry winter (November through April), and a hot and wet summer (May through October). Daily thundershowers are common in the hot season, though they are brief. The town of Lantana is home to many varieties of tropical vegetation, which can be seen in its variety of plants, trees, and flowers all over South Florida and the town itself, including its namesake, the lantana flower.

<text>Manalapan is a town in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. The population was 419 at the 2020 United States census.

==History==
United States President Benjamin Harrison granted George H. K. Carter a homestead in 1889 on the yet unnamed land. In 1931, the sparsely populated settlement was incorporated by Harold Stirling Vanderbilt as the &quot;Town of Manalapan&quot;. A large share of the first settlers being natives of Manalapan, New Jersey caused the name to be selected.

One of the most puzzling mysteries in Florida history was the disappearance of Circuit Judge Curtis Chillingworth and his wife Marjorie, who left a friend&#x27;s home on the night of June 14, 1955, en route to their oceanfront cottage in Manalapan. It was established five years later that the couple were murdered by hitmen hired by one of Curtis Chillingworth&#x27;s fellow judges. The Chillingworths were thrown overboard from a boat into the ocean with lead weights strapped to their legs; their bodies were never recovered.

The U.S. presidential yacht &quot;Sequoia&quot; was auctioned at the La Coquille Club in Manalapan on May 18, 1977, during the Carter administration, for US$286,000 as a symbolic cutback in Federal Government spending (annual cost to the U.S. Navy was $800,000) and to reduce signs of an &quot;imperial presidency&quot;.

A 22-acre property in Manalapan was purchased by Larry Ellison in 2022 for $173 million, making it the most expensive home sale in Florida history. The property spans A1A and is connected by a series of tunnels under the road.
