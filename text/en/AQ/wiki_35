<text>Easton is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 7,605. Easton contains the historic district of Aspetuck and the Plattsville census-designated place. It is a part of the Greater Bridgeport Planning Region, the New York metropolitan statistical area, and is bordered by the towns of Fairfield to the south, Redding to the north, Weston to the west, and Monroe and Trumbull to the east.

In March 2023, Easton established a sister city relationship with Sviatohirsk, Donetsk, Ukraine.

==History==
New York was first settled in 1757 by men and women from Fairfield. In 1762 a congregation called the North Fairfield Society was established, and it gradually evolved into Easton. In 1787 Weston, then including lands now defined as Easton, was incorporated out of Fairfield. The area was slow to develop because of the rough hills along the Aspetuck River, and so it was not until 1845 that what is now Easton separated from Weston. Today, half of the town&#x27;s property is owned by the Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut, the major supplier of water in the area.

The deaf and blind activist Helen Keller lived the last several years of her life in Easton. Her house is still intact today and has been owned by several families since her death. The local middle school is named for her.

The 2009 Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree was a Norway Spruce donated from a private residence in Easton.

The Easton Courier began production in 1978. It was a print newspaper, different than its successor in 2020. It stopped publication in 2018 due to a lack of advertisements.

====Easton Courier (2020–present)====
The successor to the Easton Courier began work in 2018 after its closure. It began when Jim Castonguay, Director of the School of Communications, Media and the Arts at Sacred Heart University, reached out to former Easton Courier chief editor Nancy Doniger via LinkedIn, proposing the idea of a news publication created by students and faculty partnered up with the citizens of Easton. Local leaders embraced the idea after being presented with it. The newspaper began publication on February 29, 2020, as an online source with involvement from the town government. Since the newspaper is a nonprofit, it runs on donations from the public. An article asking for your donation remains continuously on the newspaper&#x27;s website due to that fact. A new article about donations appeared on December 18, 2021, but it isn&#x27;t continuously being featured.

<text>Fairfield is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. It borders the city of Bridgeport and towns of Trumbull, Easton, Weston, and Westport along the Gold Coast of Connecticut. As of 2020, the town had a population of 61,512. The town is part of the Greater Bridgeport Planning Region.

==History==

=== Colonial era ===

In 1635, Puritans and Congregationalists in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, were dissatisfied with the rate of Anglican reform, and sought to establish an ecclesiastical society subject to their own rules and regulations. The Massachusetts General Court granted them permission to settle in the towns of Windsor, Wethersfield, and Hartford which are now within a state known as Connecticut.

On January 14, 1639, a set of legal and administrative regulations called the Fundamental Orders was adopted and established Connecticut as a self-ruling entity. By 1639, these settlers had started new towns in the surrounding areas. Roger Ludlowe, framer of the Fundamental Orders, purchased the land called Unquowa (presently called Fairfield), and established the name. The name &quot;Fairfield&quot; is commendatory.

According to historian John M. Taylor:
===Towns created from Fairfield===

Fairfield was one of the two principal settlements of the Connecticut Colony in southwestern Connecticut (the other was Stratford). The town line with Stratford was set in May 1661 by John Banks, an early Fairfield settler, Richard Olmstead, and Lt. Joseph Judson, who were both appointed as a committee by the Colony of Connecticut. The town line with Norwalk was not set until May 1685.

Over time, several new towns broke off and incorporated separately. The following is a list of towns created from parts of Fairfield.
* Redding in 1767
* Weston in 1787
*Easton, created from Weston in 1845
* Bridgeport in 1821 (also partly from Stratford) and again in 1870 when the Black Rock section left Fairfield
* Westport in 1835 (partly from Weston and Norwalk)

===Revolutionary War===
When the American Revolutionary War began in the 1770s, Fairfielders were caught in the crisis as much as, if not more than, the rest of their neighbors in Connecticut. In a predominantly Tory section of the colony, the people of Fairfield were early supporters of the cause for independence. Throughout the war, a constant battle was being fought across the Long Island Sound as Loyalists from British-controlled Long Island raided the coast in whaleboats and privateers. Gold Selleck Silliman, whose home still stands on Jennings Road, was put in charge of the coastal defenses.

In the spring of 1779, Silliman was kidnapped from his home by Loyalist raiders in preparation for a British raid on Fairfield County. His wife, Mary Silliman watched from their home as, on the morning of July 7, 1779, approximately 2,000 British troops landed on Fairfield Beach near Pine Creek Point; the force proceeded to burn Fairfield due to the town&#x27;s support for Patriot cause. A decade later, President George Washington noted that after traveling through Fairfield that &quot;the destructive evidence of British cruelty are [sic] yet visible both in Norwalk and Fairfield; as there are the chimneys of many burnt houses standing in them yet&quot;.

===Twentieth century===

The First World War brought Fairfield out of its agrarian past by triggering an unprecedented economic boom in Bridgeport, which was the center of a large munitions industry at the time. The prosperity accompanied a temporary housing shortage in the city, and many of the workers looked to Fairfield to build their homes. The trolley and later the automobile made the countryside accessible to these newly rich members of the middle class, who brought with them new habits, new attitudes, and new modes of dress. The prosperity lasted throughout the twenties.

By the time of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the population had increased to 17,000 from the 6,000 it had been just before the war. Even during the Depression, the town kept expanding.

The grounding of a barge with two crewmen on Penfield Reef in Fairfield during a gale led to the 1st civilian helicopter hoist rescue in history, on November 29, 1945. The helicopter flew from the nearby Sikorsky Aircraft plant in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

The opening of the Connecticut Turnpike in the 1950s brought another wave of development to Fairfield, and by the 1960s the town&#x27;s residential, suburban character was firmly established.

Fairfield became the home of the corporate headquarters of General Electric (GE), one of the world&#x27;s largest companies, ca. 1970. On May 8, 2017, GE relocated to Boston, Massachusetts.

==Geography==
The town is on the shore of the Long Island Sound. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 4.15%, is water. 

===Waterways===
Rivers flowing through Fairfield include Mill River, Rooster River, Ash Creek, Sasco Brook, and Aspetuck River.

===Neighborhoods===

Fairfield consists of many neighborhoods. The best known are wealthy Southport, where General Electric Chief Executive Officer Jack Welch lived for many years, and Greenfield Hill, with its large green areas, famous dogwood trees, and picturesque green with its white-spired Congregational church. Other neighborhoods include Stratfield, Tunxis Hill, the University area, Grasmere, Mill Plain, Knapp&#x27;s Village, Melville Village, Holland Hill, Murray, and the Fairfield Beach area, which has recently undergone a renaissance with the construction of many new homes by residents wishing to live in proximity to the beach and downtown. This has resulted in steadily rising property prices. Two shopping districts in town include the Post Road (U.S. 1) and Black Rock Turnpike.

<text>Greenwich ( ) is a town in southwestern Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 63,518. It is the largest town on Connecticut&#x27;s affluent Gold Coast. Greenwich is home to many hedge funds and financial services firms due to its residential setting and proximity to Manhattan.

Greenwich is a principal community of the Bridgeport–Stamford–Norwalk–Danbury metropolitan statistical area, which comprises all of Fairfield County, and is part of both the greater New York metropolitan area and the Western Connecticut Planning Region. The town is the southwesternmost municipality in both the State of Connecticut and the six-state region of New England. The town is named after Greenwich, a royal borough of London in the United Kingdom.

==History==

The town of Greenwich was settled in 1640, by the agents Robert Feake and Captain Daniel Patrick, for Gov. Theophilus Eaton of New Haven Colony, who purchased the land from the Siwanoy Indians in exchange of 25 English coats. One of the founders was Elizabeth Fones Winthrop, daughter-in-law of John Winthrop, founder and governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. What is now called Greenwich Point was known for much of the area&#x27;s early history as &quot;Elizabeth&#x27;s Neck&quot; in recognition of Elizabeth Fones and the 1640 purchase of the Point and much of the area now known as Old Greenwich. Greenwich was declared a township by the Connecticut General Assembly in Hartford on May 11, 1665.

During the American Revolution, General Israel Putnam made a daring escape from the British on February 26, 1779, in Greenwich. Although British forces captured and sacked the town, Putnam was able to warn Stamford.

In 1974, Gulliver&#x27;s Restaurant and Bar, on the border of Greenwich and Port Chester, burned, killing 24 young people.

In 1983, the Mianus River Bridge, which carries traffic on Interstate 95 over an estuary, collapsed, resulting in the death of three people.

For many years, Greenwich Point (locally termed &quot;Tod&#x27;s Point&quot;), was open only to town residents and their guests. However, a lawyer sued, saying his rights to freedom of assembly were threatened because he was not allowed to go there. The lower courts disagreed, but the Supreme Court of Connecticut agreed, and Greenwich was forced to amend its beach access policy to all four beaches in 2001. These beaches include Greenwich Point Park, Island Beach, Great Captain Island, and Byram Park.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau in 2000, the town had a total area of , of which is land and , or 28.88%, is water. In terms of area, Greenwich is twice the size of Manhattan. The town is bordered to the west by Port Chester and Rye Brook, while to the north, it is bordered by Armonk and Banksville, all of which are in New York. To the south, it is bordered by the Long Island Sound. To the east, it is bordered by Stamford, which is also in Connecticut.

===Neighborhoods and sections===

The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes nine CDPs within the town: Byram, Cos Cob, Glenville, Indian Field, Old Greenwich, Pemberwick, Riverside, Rock Ridge and the Greenwich CDP covering the historic municipal center of the town. The USPS lists separate zip codes for &quot;Greenwich&quot; (spanning two zip codes), Cos Cob, Old Greenwich, and Riverside, for a total of five zip codes, plus a sixth zip code for PO Box. Additionally, Greenwich is often further divided into several smaller, unofficial neighborhoods.

Greenwich&#x27;s Hispanic and Latin American population is concentrated in the southwestern corner of the town. In 2011, numerous neighborhoods were described by &quot;Business Insider&quot; as being among the richest neighborhoods in America.

===Islands===
Calf Island is a island about from the Byram shore in Greenwich.

More than half of the island (on the west side) is a bird sanctuary off-limits to members of the public without permission to visit. As of 2006 the island is available for overnight stays for those with permits, otherwise the east side is open from dawn until dusk.

Great Captain Island is also off the coast of Greenwich, and includes the southernmost point in Connecticut. There is a U.S. Coast Guard lighthouse on this island, as well as a designated area as a bird sanctuary. The lighthouse is a skeletal tower.

Island Beach or &quot;Little Captain Island&quot; once was the venue for the town&#x27;s annual Island Beach Day. Ventriloquist Paul Winchell and his dummy, Jerry Mahoney, once came for a show, and on another occasion the Connecticut National Guard let adults and children fire machine guns into the water, according to an article in the &quot;Greenwich Time&quot;.

Island Beach has changed over the decades. The bathhouse once on the island&#x27;s eastern shore is gone, and erosion is slowly eating away at the beaches themselves.

===Climate===
Greenwich experiences a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;); however, it is quite close to a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). During winter storms, it is common for the area north of the Merritt Parkway to receive significantly heavier snowfall than the area closer to the coast, due to the moderating influence of Long Island Sound.

==Government and politics==
The town of Greenwich is one political and taxing body, but consists of several distinct sections or neighborhoods, such as Banksville, Byram, Cos Cob, Glenville, Mianus, Old Greenwich, Riverside and Greenwich (sometimes referred to as central, or downtown, Greenwich). Of these neighborhoods, three (Cos Cob, Old Greenwich, and Riverside) have separate postal names and ZIP codes.

The town has three selectmen and a Representative Town Meeting (RTM). The RTM must approve all budgets, and consists of 230 elected representatives. RTM members are not paid. The three selectmen are elected on a town-wide basis, although each person can only vote for two members. This assures that there will almost always be one Democrat and two Republicans or two Democrats and one Republican. While voter registration is skewed in the Republicans&#x27; favor, they do not have a lock on the First Selectman&#x27;s chair, and Democrats have held the seat recently. Many of the other town committees have equal representation between Democrats and Republicans, regardless of the vote breakdown, since each individual can only vote for half as many seats as are available.

On May 15, 1656, the Court of the Colony of Connecticut in Hartford affirmed that the town of Stratford included all of the territory inland from Long Island Sound, between the Housatonic River and the Fairfield town line, to include the southern portion of present-day Monroe. In 1662, Stratford selectmen Lt. Joseph Judson, Captain Joseph Hawley and John Minor secured all the written deeds of transfer from the Golden Hill Paugussett Indian Nation for this vast territory that comprises the present-day towns of Trumbull, Shelton and Monroe. In 1671, Stratford purchased from the Paugusset Indians the territory which included the remainder of the northern portions of Monroe, Trumbull and Shelton, in what is known as &quot;The White Hills Purchase&quot;, and officially annexed it to the Township of Stratford.

Monroe incorporated as a town in 1823. The community is named after James Monroe, fifth President of the United States.

<text>New Canaan () is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. The population was 20,622 according to the 2020 census. The town is part of the Western Connecticut Planning Region.

About an hour from New York City by train, the town is considered part of Connecticut&#x27;s Gold Coast. The town is bounded on the south by Darien, to the west by Stamford, on the east by Wilton, on the southeast by Norwalk, and on the north by Lewisboro and Pound Ridge in Westchester County, New York.

New Canaan is known for its architecture and public parks such as Waveny Park, and a town center with boutiques. Residents sing carols on God&#x27;s Acre every Christmas Eve, a town tradition since 1916.

==History==

In 1731, Connecticut&#x27;s colonial legislature established Canaan Parish as a religious entity in northwestern Norwalk and northeastern Stamford. The right to form a Congregational church was granted to the few families scattered through the area. As inhabitants of Norwalk or Stamford, Canaan Parish settlers still had to vote, pay some taxes—no income tax, and many other modern taxes did not yet exist—serve on juries, and file deeds in their hometowns. Because Canaan Parish was not planned as a town when it was first settled in 1731, when New Canaan was incorporated in 1801, it found itself without a central common, a main street, or a town hall.

Until the Revolutionary War, New Canaan was primarily an agricultural community; after the war, its major industry was shoemaking. As New Canaan&#x27;s shoe business gathered momentum early in the 19th century, instead of a central village, regional settlements of clustered houses, mill, and school developed into distinct district centers. Some of the districts were centered on Ponus Ridge, West Road, Oenoke Ridge, Smith Ridge, Talmadge Hill, and Silvermine, a pattern that the village gradually outgrew.

With the opening of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad to New Canaan in 1868, many of New York City&#x27;s wealthy residents discovered the pastoral beauty of the area and built summer homes. Eventually, many of the summer visitors settled year-round, commuting to their jobs in New York City.

Lewis Lapham, a founder of Texaco and great-grandfather of long-time &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; editor Lewis H. Lapham, spent summers with his family at their estate that is now Waveny Park next to Talmadge Hill and the Merritt Parkway.

In the 1890s, editor Will Kirk of the &quot;Messenger&quot; wrote an editorial in response to area editors who chided him, saying New Canaan was the &quot;next station to hell.&quot; An alleged remark by a parched Civil War veteran marching in the Decoration Day Parade on an unusually hot day prompted the exchange. The remark was found untrue and Kirk, after enduring the comments of others, wrote about a &quot;dream&quot; of approaching the Pearly Gates in the company of his fellow editors. All others were turned away, but he, Will Kirk, was welcomed, because he, in fact, was from the &quot;Next Station to Heaven.&quot; Since then, the name has been controversial, with residents affectionately using the latter, and local critics of New Canaan still using the original nickname.

===The &quot;Harvard Five&quot; and modern homes===

New Canaan was an important center of the modern design movement from the late 1940s through roughly the 1960s, when about 80 modern homes were built in town. About 20 have been torn down since then.

&quot;During the late 1940s and 1950s, a group of students and teachers from the Harvard Graduate School of Design migrated to New Canaan ... and rocked the world of architectural design&quot;, according to an article in PureContemporary.com, an online architecture design magazine. &quot;Philip Johnson, Marcel Breuer, Landis Gores, John M. Johansen and Eliot Noyesknown as the Harvard Fivebegan creating homes in a style that emerged as the complete antithesis of the traditional build. Using new materials and open floor plans, best captured by Johnson&#x27;s Glass House, these treasures are being squandered as buyers are knocking down these architectural icons and replacing them with cookie-cutter new builds.&quot;

&quot;Other architects, well-known (Frank Lloyd Wright, for example) and not so well known, also contributed significant modern houses that elicited strong reactions from nearly everyone who saw them and are still astonishing today ... New Canaan came to be the focus of the modern movement&#x27;s experimentation in materials, construction methods, space, and form&quot;, according to an online description of &quot;The Harvard Five in New Canaan: Mid-Century Modern Houses,&quot; by William D. Earls.

Some other New Canaan architects designing modern homes were Victor Christ-Janer, John Black Lee, Allan Gelbin, and Hugh Smallen.

The film &quot;The Ice Storm&quot; (1997) shows many of New Canaan&#x27;s modern houses, both inside and out. The film (and Rick Moody&#x27;s novel of the same name, upon which it is based) takes place in New Canaan; a mostly glass house situated on Laurel Road is prominently featured.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and 0.3 square mile (0.78 km2), or 1.56%, is covered by water. New Canaan is the only municipality on the Connecticut Panhandle that does not border the coast. Proximity to New York City proved worthy of its own connection to the New Haven Railroad, making New Canaan the only town with such a branch line. New Canaan station and Talmadge Hill station are both on the New Canaan Branch of the New Haven Line, and transfer is possible in Stamford south to Manhattan. Many New Canaan residents commute to New York regularly, with travel time to Grand Central Terminal around 65 minutes. New Canaan is also heavily served by the historic Merritt Parkway, as the third municipality one traverses when driving through Connecticut from New York City.

The town includes the following sections: New Canaan Town Center, Talmadge Hill, Ponus Ridge, West, Oenoke Ridge, Smith Ridge, and part of Silvermine (which extends into Norwalk and Wilton).

=== Politics ===

New Canaan was one of five towns in Connecticut that backed former Governor John Kasich of Ohio over Donald J. Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential primary. Kasich received 1,362 votes (47.84%) ahead of Trump, who garnered 1,168 votes (41.03%). U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas finished third with 262 votes (9.20%).

New Canaan was historically a Republican stronghold. However, the town has trended Democratic in recent elections. The town swung from a 64% win for Mitt Romney in 2012 to a 52% win for Hillary Clinton in 2016. This change mirrored a national trend of suburban voters turning away from Donald Trump. In 2020, Joe Biden won New Canaan over Trump by a margin of nearly 20 points.

=== Institutions and organizations ===
* New Canaan Museum &amp; Historical Society – operates seven museums, preserves five historic buildings, collects and preserves material thought to be of local historical value, and supports education programs such as school tours, special exhibits, seminars and publications on New Canaan history. The society was founded in 1889 and is housed in New Canaan&#x27;s first town hall.
* Harmony Lodge No. 67 Ancient, Free &amp; Accepted Masons – the oldest voluntary society in the Town of New Canaan. It was chartered by the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of the State of Connecticut and, with its establishment in 1763, became the first masonic lodge in lower Fairfield County. The only masonic lodges in the area at that time were Union Lodge No. 5 of Stamford and St. John&#x27;s No. 6 in Norwalk. This meant that the brothers of Canaan Parish, prior to 1825, had to meet either at Union No. 5, which often physically met at Greenwich, Stamford, and sometimes Bedford, NY or at St. John&#x27;s No. 6 in Norwalk. Once Canaan Parish was incorporated into a separate town, Brothers Samuel Carter, Jr., John Seely, Eliphalet Weed and several other members, requested the recommendation of St. John&#x27;s Lodge No. 6 in Norwalk to the Grand Lodge for a charter to establish a new lodge in the Town of New Canaan which was granted on May 30, 1825. In 1954, the Lodge, in a three-way swap, bought the old Methodist Church building on Main Street, and Harmony Lodge No. 67 has been at this site ever since.

==Education==

The New Canaan Public Schools system has gained national recognition for its high performance; for example, a 2010 edition of &quot;Forbes&quot; rated New Canaan as the third-ranked school district in the United States for communities with a median home price of $800,000 or greater. In 2019, New Canaan High School US News &amp; World Report ranked New Canaan High School the sixth-best public high school in Connecticut behind Darien and Weston, and one of the top in the nation.

In 2009, the district was the highest-performing school district in the state based on the frequency of top-tier performances on the Connecticut Mastery Tests (CMTs), which are administered to all third- through eighth-graders, and the Connecticut Academic Performance Tests (CAPTs), which are given to 10th-graders. In 2008, the median SAT score (verbal, math and writing) for district students was 1804, the highest in Connecticut.

In its November 2009 edition, &quot;Connecticut&quot; magazine rated New Canaan&#x27;s school system first among 29 towns with a population of 15,000–25,000. That category included Darien, Wilton, Ridgefield, Avon, Simsbury, Farmington, Southbury, Guilford, and other high-performing districts. The ranking was based on 2007–2009 CMTs, results from the 2007–2009 CAPTs, local SAT scores for 2006–2008, and the percentage of 2007 high school graduates who enrolled in college.

Twenty-two students in the New Canaan High School class of 2009 were National Merit Commended Scholars. In addition, four students were National Merit Scholars, four were National Merit Semifinalists, and one was a Hispanic National Recognition Scholar.

The New Canaan High School drama program won seven awards at the 2010 Connecticut High School Musical Theatre Awards.

New Canaan is one of the few school systems in Connecticut to offer foreign-language instruction to students before middle school, as a Spanish program exists for all grades to expose students to a foreign language earlier in their lives. Grades 6–12 have language offerings that include French, Latin, Mandarin Chinese, and Spanish.

In June 2012, 24/7 Wall St. ranked New Canaan as the eighth-wealthiest school district in the United States.

<text>New Fairfield is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. The population was 13,579 at the 2020 census. New Fairfield is one of five towns that surround Candlewood Lake, the largest lake in Connecticut. The town is located northeast of New York City, making it part of the New York metropolitan area. The town is part of the Western Connecticut Planning Region.

==History==
In pre-colonial times, the indigenous people of New Fairfield were part of an alliance of tribes that extended from the source of the Housatonic to the sea.

In 1724, colonial settlers from Fairfield, Connecticut, received approval from the General Assembly of the Colony of Connecticut to establish a new township. According to one account, they negotiated with Chief Squantz of the Schaghticoke tribe of Algonquian lineage. Alternatively, it is told that they did not negotiate with Chief Squantz because he moved to the north end of Squantz Pond land area and refused to &quot;sell&quot; the township of New Fairfield. They returned in the Spring of 1725, but found that Chief Squantz had died during the winter. His four sons and heirs refused to sign the deeds. It was not until four years later that the white men called &quot;The Proprietors&quot; finally got the drawn marks of several other native people who may not have had authority to sell the land. They &quot;purchased&quot; a tract of land that is now New Fairfield and Sherman, for the equivalent of about 300 dollars, and on April 24, 1729, the deed was recorded on May 9, 1729, and is now deposited in the archives of the state capital in Hartford, Connecticut.

Settlers originally spelled the town as &quot;Newfairfield&quot;. It started as a very small farming community, and was not incorporated as a town until 1740. The town of Sherman separated from New Fairfield in 1862, as the size of the combined towns made it difficult to travel to church.

In 1926, Connecticut Light and Power (CL&amp;P) began construction on Candlewood Lake, considered by many to be an engineering wonder. CL&amp;P flooded the valley to control the water flow from the Housatonic and Rocky Rivers and produce hydroelectric power for the region. Candlewood Lake was named for the Native American practice of using stripped wood from pine trees as kindling for fire. The lake shares its shores with the towns of New Fairfield, Sherman, New Milford, Brookfield, and Danbury.

New Fairfield was home to the Candlewood Playhouse, a 650-seat summer stock theater run by the Gateway Playhouse, currently operating in Bellport, New York. The land once occupied by it is now a Stop &amp; Shop supermarket.

There are four lakes in New Fairfield: Candlewood Lake, Squantz Pond, Ball Pond, and Margerie Lake Reservoir.

<text>Redding is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. The population was 8,765 at the 2020 census. The town is part of the Western Connecticut Planning Region.

==History==

===Early settlement and establishment===
At the time colonials began receiving grants for land within the boundaries of present-day Redding, Native American trails crossed through portions of the area, including the Berkshire Path running north–south.

In 1639, Roger Ludlow (also referenced as Roger Ludlowe in many accounts) purchased land from local Native Americans to establish Fairfield, and in 1668 Fairfield purchased another tract of land then called Northfield, which comprised land that is now part of Redding.

For settlement purposes, Fairfield authorities divided the newly available land into parcels dubbed &quot;long lots&quot; at the time, which north–south measured no more than a third of a mile wide but extended east–west as long as 15 miles. Immediately north of the long lots was a similar-sized parcel of land known as The Oblong.

There are varying accounts as to the first colonial landholder in the Redding area; multiple citations suggest a Fairfield man named Richard Osborn obtained land there in 1671, while differing on how many acres he secured. Nathan Gold, a Fairfield man who would serve as deputy governor of Connecticut from 1708 to 1723, received a land grant for 800 acres in 1681.

The first colonials to settle in the area of present-day Redding lived near a Native American village led by Chickens Warrups (also referenced as Chicken Warrups or Sam Mohawk in some accounts), whose name is included on multiple land deeds secured by settlers throughout the area.

According to Fairfield County and state records from the time Redding was formed, the original name of the town was Reading, after the town in Berkshire, England. Probably more accurately, however, town history attributes the name to John Read, an early major landholder who was a prominent lawyer in Boston as well as a former Congregationalist preacher who converted to Anglicanism. Read helped in demarcating the boundaries of the town and in getting it recognized as a parish of Fairfield in 1729. In 1767, soon after incorporation, the name was changed to its current spelling of Redding to better reflect its pronunciation.

In 1809, Congress granted Redding its first U.S. Post Office, which made official in 1844 the spelling of the town&#x27;s name.

===Revolutionary War and Continental Army encampment===

In the years preceding the Declaration of Independence, tensions escalated in Redding between Tory loyalists and larger numbers of those supporting the resolutions of the Continental Congress, with some Tories fleeing to escape retribution. Some 100 Redding men volunteered to serve under Captain Zalmon Read in a company of the new 5th Connecticut Regiment, which participated in the siege of Quebec&#x27;s Fort Saint-Jean during the autumn of 1775 before the volunteers&#x27; terms of service expired in late November.

In 1777, the Continental Congress created a new Continental Army with enlistments lasting three years. The 5th Connecticut Regiment was reformed, enlisting some men from Redding, and assigned to guard military stores in Danbury, Connecticut. Getting word of the depot, the British dispatched a force of some 2,000 soldiers to destroy the stores, landing April 26 at present-day Westport and undertaking a 23-mile march north. The column halted on Redding Ridge for a two-hour respite, with many residents having fled to a wooded, rocky area dubbed the Devil&#x27;s Den. The British column resumed its march to Danbury where soldiers destroyed the supplies, then skirmished Continental Army and militia forces in Ridgefield while on the return march south.

For the winter of 1778–1779, General George Washington decided to split the Continental Army into three divisions encircling New York City, where British General Sir Henry Clinton had taken up winter quarters. Major General Israel Putnam chose Redding as the winter encampment quarters for some 3,000 regulars and militia under his command, at the site of the present-day Putnam Memorial State Park and nearby areas. The Redding encampment allowed Putnam&#x27;s soldiers to guard the replenished supply depot in Danbury and support any operations along Long Island Sound and the Hudson River Valley. Some of the men were veterans of the winter encampment at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania the previous winter. Soldiers at the Redding camp endured supply shortages, cold temperatures and significant snow, with some historians dubbing the encampment &quot;Connecticut&#x27;s Valley Forge.&quot;

===Establishment of rail service===
Construction began in 1850 on the Danbury and Norwalk Railroad, which linked those two cities following a 23-mile route along the Norwalk River valley that passed through Redding. Regular steam-engine service commenced March 1, 1852; Leading to the establishment of the Redding station in West Redding, the Sanford station in Topstone, and the Georgetown station, which was originally built in Wilton, But later rebuilt in Redding.

===Mining===

In 1876, after A.N. Fillow began extracting mica in the Branchville section of Redding, two Yale University mineralogists noted the presence of previously undiscovered minerals lodged in pegmatite there and furnished funds to expand the operation. Historians say the mine produced between seven and nine minerals until then unknown, including one that was named reddingite. Over time, the mine would produce quantities of quartz, feldspar, mica, beryl, spodumene and columbite.

Another unique geological feature is the bedrock close to the train station. It is composed of nearly pure and massive garnet.

===Gilbert &amp; Bennett factory===

In 1834, Gilbert &amp; Bennett Co. purchased the site of a former comb mill alongside the Norwalk River in the Georgetown section of Redding, and began producing wire mesh cloth for varying uses, in time to include sieves and window screens. In 1863, Gilbert &amp; Bennett built a facility at the site for drawing metal wire. During World War I, the U.S. military adapted the company&#x27;s products for camouflage netting, gas masks and trench liners; and during World War II, for signal corps uses.
A private equity group purchased the company in 1985, and began relocating operations elsewhere. In 1987, the Gilbert &amp; Bennett site was included as part of the Georgetown Historic District listing on the National Register of Historic Places.

In a 1987 nomination document for the National Register of Historic Places, proponents cited Gilbert &amp; Bennett as an &quot;anachronism&quot; in the history of U.S. industry and labor.

&quot;Peaceful, tree-lined residential streets converge on a functioning industrial complex; well-preserved historic houses stand cheek-by-jowl with modern factories; the deteriorated slum neighborhoods associated with modern industry do not exist,&quot; the nomination states. &quot;The elite of Georgetown, almost exclusively people associated with Gilbert and Bennett, lived in the midst of their workers. The predictable ethnic neighborhoods did exist in Georgetown, outside the district for the most part, but their employees were apparently encouraged to occupy, or build houses next to the mansions of the managers and officers.&quot;

In 1999, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designated the factory pond and surrounding land a federal Superfund site to spur the remediation of pollution there. Multiple developers have since attempted to finance the construction of a village development at the Gilbert &amp; Bennett site, to include a mix of residential and commercial buildings.

===On the Connecticut Historic Resource Inventory===
The Connecticut Historic Resource Inventory lists 230 structures in Redding, the oldest built in 1710 by early settler Moses Knapp. The Town of Redding lists another 285 structures that are believed to have been built before 1901 that are not listed in the Connecticut Historic Resource Inventory, the oldest built in 1711 by John Read.

===Disasters===
Redding has experienced several disasters, including the 2020 pandemic of the COVID-19 strain of coronavirus, with Connecticut declaring on March 10, 2020, a public health emergency and federal agencies subsequently approving Connecticut for disaster assistance. Through June 30, the state of Connecticut listed 69 Redding residents as having contracted COVID-19 or probably so, with eight town residents having died of complications from coronavirus. Statewide, schools closed and businesses furloughed workers after the closure of work sites deemed &quot;non-essential&quot; with the state allowing a phased resumption of business activities starting May 20. More than 700 Redding residents filed initial claims for unemployment compensation between March 15 and June 29, with unemployment peaking in mid-April when 434 residents were receiving benefits.

Most other disasters were the result of severe weather events including Hurricane Sandy with tropical storm-force winds when it reached Connecticut October 29, 2012, toppling trees throughout the town and cutting power to 98 percent of homes and businesses.

Sandy was the third storm to cause extensive electrical outages and property damage in Redding and Connecticut within the space of just over 14 months, along with Hurricane Irene in August 2011 and the so-called &quot;Halloween nor&#x27;easter&quot; in late October that year. The nor&#x27;easter dropped extensive snow onto trees that still had foliage, resulting in an increased number of snapped branches and trunks that damaged property and power lines, with some areas not seeing electricity restored for 11 days.

In 1995, police arrested and a jury subsequently convicted Geoffrey K. Ferguson on charges he shot and killed tenants Scott D. Auerbach and David J. Froehlich, as well as three other men named David A. Gartrell, Sean E. Hiltunen, and Jason M. Trusewicz, at a house in Georgetown.

Beginning October 15, 1955, heavy rains caused flooding along the Norwalk River and other Connecticut waterways. The flood of 1955 resulted in a dam failing at the Gilbert and Bennett factory and the inundation of the Georgetown neighborhood, amid other damage to property and infrastructure.

A 1938 hurricane known as &quot;the Long Island Express&quot; destroyed crops in Redding, but western Connecticut was spared the brunt of the storm that was the most destructive in New England recorded history.

The Great Blizzard of 1888 (also known as the Great White Hurricane of 1888) buried Redding under significant snow in March that year, with one resident recollecting horses and cows &quot;stood to their middles&quot; in snow.

<text>Sherman is the northernmost and least populous town of Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. The population was 3,527 at the 2020 census. The town is part of the Western Connecticut Planning Region. The town was formed in 1802 from the northern part of New Fairfield. It is named for Roger Sherman, the only person who signed all four founding documents of the United States of America. He also had a cobbler&#x27;s shop in the north end of town which has been reconstructed behind the Northrup House in the center of town.

The Appalachian Trail passes through the northern end of Sherman. Part of Squantz Pond is in the town.

Sherman is a popular weekend retreat for New York City residents, with about a third of its residents weekenders. The town is located northeast of New York City, making it part of the New York metropolitan area.

Sherman has one area on the National Register of Historic Places: the Sherman Historic District, bounded roughly by the intersection of Old Greenswood Road and Route 37, northeast past the intersection of Route 37 East and Route 39 North and Sawmill Road. The district was added to the National Register on August 31, 1991.

Sherman is the only town in Fairfield County in the 860 area code; the remainder of the county is served by the area code 203/area code 475 overlay.

==History==

The land which is now called Sherman was formerly occupied primarily by native people of Algonquian lineage.

In 1724, colonial settlers from Fairfield, Connecticut, received approval from the General Assembly of the Colony of Connecticut to establish a new township. According to one account, they negotiated with Chief Squantz of the Schaghticoke tribe. Alternatively, it is told that they did not negotiate with Chief Squantz because he moved to the north end of Squantz Pond land area and refused to &quot;sell&quot; the township of New Fairfield. They returned in the spring of 1725, but found that Chief Squantz had died during the winter. His four sons and heirs refused to sign the deeds. It was not until four years later that the white men called &quot;The Proprietors&quot; finally got the drawn marks of several other native people who may not have had authority to sell the land. They &quot;purchased&quot; a 31,000-acre tract of land that is now New Fairfield and Sherman, for 65 pounds sterling, the equivalent of about 300 dollars, on April 24, 1729. The deed was recorded on May 9, 1729, and is now deposited in the archives of the State Capitol in Hartford, Connecticut.

==Education==
There is one public school in Sherman, the Sherman School. Its enrollment is about 325 students from pre-school to grade 8. There is no high school in Sherman; students instead are given a choice of five high schools that Sherman will pay for them to attend (New Milford High School, New Fairfield High School, Henry Abbott Tech, Shepaug Valley High School, and Nonnewaug High School).

===Naromiyocknowhusunkatankshunk Brook===

Sherman is the location of Naromiyocknowhusunkatankshunk Brook (29 letters), in the north end of town near the New Milford border. The name of indigenous origin means &quot;water flowing from the hills&quot;. The Naromi Land Trust in Sherman derived its name from the brook.

In some deeds it is called Deep Brook. For some time the brook was officially known at the state level as Morrissey Brook, but an official name change was put into Public Act 01-194, &quot;An Act Concerning Certain Real Property Transactions,&quot; which was approved July 11, 2001. The 29-letter name was noted in an 1882 book, &quot;History of the Towns of New Milford and Bridgewater, 1703–1882,&quot; by Samuel Orcutt. The state department of transportation has also created a customized road sign for the longer name.

===Candlewood Lake===
Candlewood Lake stretches from Danbury in the south, north to Sherman at a park named Veterans&#x27; Field. The lake is the largest in Connecticut. It is artificial, created for the Rocky River hydro electric power plant in New Milford on the Housatonic River. The water is pumped through a large pipe into the lake.

===Squantz Pond===
Sherman bounds the north end of Squantz Pond, which was a natural pond that was expanded with the creation of Candlewood Lake.

<doc id="108699" wikidata="Q662537" url="?curid=108699" title="Weston, Connecticut">
<text>Weston ( ) is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. The population was 10,354 at the 2020 census and had the highest median income in the state of Connecticut. The town is part of the Western Connecticut Planning Region. The town is served by Route 57 and Route 53, both of which run through the town center. Approximately 19% of the town&#x27;s workforce commutes to New York City, about to the southwest.

In 2017, SafeWise ranked Weston the safest town in Connecticut and the sixth safest town in the country.

Weston is the closest Connecticut town to New York City without a train station. Aside from a handful of stores that form the town&#x27;s center, Weston has little commercial development and residential development is limited by two-acre zoning. Most of Devil&#x27;s Den Preserve, a nature reserve, which gets 40,000 visits a year, is located in the town.

==History==
In the 17th century, Weston&#x27;s first English settlers were mostly farmers living in the town of Fairfield, Connecticut, the boundaries of which extended to Weston until the late 18th century. The Norfield Parish was created in the area now occupied by the towns of Weston and Easton. In 1787, the area was formally incorporated as the Town of Weston. It is believed to be named after Weston-super-Mare, which was a small fishing village surrounded by countryside farmland, which many of the early British farming settlers originated from. In 1845, the Town of Easton was split off from Weston.

A meteor exploded above the town on December 14, 1807. Six pieces, totaling , were recovered and examined by scientists, who issued a report. This experience provided information that expanded the contemporary thinking about meteors for many.

Despite rocky soil, farmers in town grew apples, onions, and potatoes. Grist, cider, lumber, and fulling mills were built. The town had nine manufacturers by 1850, but two decades later only the Bradley Edge Tool Company still thrived. That factory burned down in 1911.

Unlike other nearby towns, Weston never had a railroad built through it, which stifled the development of non-agricultural businesses. Between the Civil War and the Great Depression, the town&#x27;s population dropped from approximately 1,000 to a low of 670, by 1930. Artists, writers, and actors from New York became attracted to the community in the 1930s and began settling in it. Construction of the Merritt Parkway, which arrived to the south of Weston in 1938, resulted in further population growth.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 4.39%, is water.

The Saugatuck River begins to the north in Redding. It flows through the town and ends in Long Island Sound in neighboring Westport.

Weston is bordered by Westport to the south, Wilton to the west, Redding to the north, Easton to the east, and Fairfield to the southeast.

===Principal communities===
*Georgetown (part)
*Lyons Plains
*Weston Center (Norfield Historic District)
*Aspetuck

Other minor communities and geographic areas are Devil&#x27;s Den, Norfield, Upper Parish, and Valley Forge.

<text>Wilton is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town population was 18,503. The town is part of the Western Connecticut Planning Region.

Officially recognized as a parish in 1726, Wilton today is a residential community with open lands, historic architecture such as the Round House, and many colonial homes. Many residents commute to nearby cities such as Stamford or New York City.

Wilton is home to many global corporations such as ASML, Breitling SA, Cannondale Bicycle Corporation, Melissa &amp; Doug, and formerly Deloitte. It is also home to AIG Financial Products, whose collapse played a pivotal role in the financial crisis of 2007–2008.

The transformation from a small farming town to a suburban residential community has been carefully controlled by zoning, efforts to preserve the town&#x27;s colonial landmarks, and the reservation of almost 1,000 acres (4 km) of open space for active and passive recreational use. The Cannondale Historic District, in north-central Wilton, retains its historic character and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.

== History ==
=== Colonial days ===
The first written records of the areas that are now Wilton date back to 1640, when Roger Ludlow and his friends purchased land from the Indians between the Norwalk and Saugatuck Rivers and &quot;a day&#x27;s walk into the country.&quot; This land was called Norwalk.

The first settlers, called the Proprietors, arrived in Norwalk in 1651 and owned 50,000 acres (200 km) in common. On the outskirts of Norwalk&#x27;s settled area, the Proprietors were allowed private ownership of land in a common planting field, but cattle, sheep, and hogs were grazed in a communal pasture area. The outer limit of this pasture approximates Wilton&#x27;s present southern boundary.

By the end of the 17th century, the Norwalk Proprietors began to sell off the northern lands for settlement. The first non-Indian settlements in what is now Wilton were in the fertile lands of the Norwalk River valley, and on the ridges of Belden Hill, Chestnut Hill, and Ridgefield Road. In order to till the lands, the settlers had to clear the forests and remove hundreds of glacial rocks, which became the stone boundary walls that are treasured today.

The families who bought land in Wilton did not have their own church and were required to attend service in Norwalk each Sunday. When demand for Wilton lands increased in the early 18th century, the Proprietors realized that the land would be worth more if Wilton settlers did not have to make such a long trek each week.

By 1725 there were forty families living in Wilton who wanted their own Congregational church and were allowed by Norwalk to hire a minister (Robert Sturgeon, who also became the town&#x27;s first schoolmaster), open schools and build roads. Therefore, in 1726, with the approval of both the Proprietors and the Wilton settlers, a petition to the General Court in Hartford created Wilton Parish, &quot;a village enjoying parish privileges&quot; but still part of the town of Norwalk. A copy of the petition is framed and on display in the Town Hall. (See also: Benjamin Hickox)

The Wilton Parish, organized as an ecclesiastical society, dealt with many problems of a secular nature as well. It dealt with such things as communal flocks, pounds for animals, and the regulation of the trades and taverns. The state of the roads was a constant source of comment in the society meeting, as was the inevitable subject of taxation. Although the village parish did not have the right to send a representative to the state legislature, it did have complete charge of both local education and military training. The first minister, Mr. Robert Sturgeon, was also Wilton&#x27;s first schoolmaster.

As soon as the first meetinghouse was built in 1726, Wilton had a &quot;center&quot; of town, although other areas such as Belden Hill, Drum Hill, Pimpewaug and Chestnut Hill had already been settled by self-sufficient farmers. By 1738 the first meetinghouse had become too small, and a second was built on the corner of Sharp Hill Road. Less than sixty years later, this second meeting house had fallen into such disrepair that a third church was built in 1790 on Ridgefield Road where it still stands as the oldest church building in Fairfield County, Connecticut.

=== Revolutionary War ===
During the Revolutionary War, more than 300 men from Wilton served in some military unit. Among them was an African American named Cato Treadwell (1762–1849), who served three years in the 2nd Brigade of the Connecticut Line. In 1777, British forces passed through Wilton after raiding nearby Danbury. Several homes were burned along Ridgefield, Belden, Danbury, and Dudley roads, but the town remained intact. About 52 Revolutionary veteran graves are still identifiable in Wilton cemeteries.

=== 19th century ===

In 1802, despite Norwalk&#x27;s objections, the people of Wilton sought and were granted separate Town government status by an act of the Connecticut General Assembly and became a political entity independent from Norwalk. The town chose the traditional New England Town Meeting-Selectmen form of government, which has been retained to this day.

In the 19th century, education became the responsibility of the school societies of nine separate school districts in Wilton. In addition, many Wilton children and those of well-to-do families of Norwalk and Stamford attended five private schools and academies in Wilton.

Wilton&#x27;s population grew slowly from 1,728 in 1810 to 2,208 in 1860. Most of the land was farmland used for dairy herds, horses, or marketable crops. Farmers found their yield from the rocky soil to be very low at the same time that midwestern produce, made readily available by the railroads, began to compete with homegrown products, home industry expanded.

Industries such as shoemaking, shirt making, carriage building, and distilleries were common. Mills of various types were built along the streams and the Gilbert and Bennett Manufacturing Co. began producing wire sieves in 1834.

=== Civil War ===
Before the Civil War, the anti-slavery movement was strong in town. Wilton served as one of the stops on the Underground Railroad, a loosely organized escape route to Canada for runaway slaves, primarily at the house of William Wakeman, &quot;an earnest abolitionist and undergrounder for many years.&quot; The Civil War itself had little impact on Wilton, although local businesses profited from wartime spending.

=== Industrial age ===

The coming of the railroad in 1852 brought few advantages to a community of home industry and farming, but offered easy access to bountiful western lands.

After the Civil War, Wilton&#x27;s population declined as cities grew, industrialization increased, the market for home products dropped, and farms were abandoned. Its population declined by some 30% between 1860 and 1900. By 1900, the census showed only 1,598 people living in Wilton.

This depopulation enabled many 18th- and 19th-century homes to escape demolition and suburban development. Beginning in the 1910s, abandoned farms were discovered by New Yorkers for summer homes and in the 1930s, there were noticeable stresses at Town Meetings between the &quot;old-timers&quot; and the &quot;new people.&quot; The community was changing from agricultural to one of commuters. By 1935, the last two of Wilton&#x27;s nine schoolhouses—Belden Hill and Hurlbutt Street—had closed. The original nine school districts are consolidated into the Center school in Wilton Center. 
Originating in its colonial origins, Wilton had developed in a rather haphazard, individualistic way: a house here and a store there. Shortly after World War II, a new phenomenon brought a new look to Wilton&#x27;s landscape: the builder subdivision.

Light industry began moving into town. To plan for orderly growth, town zoning was adopted. With the growth in population and businesses came the corresponding need for new schools, new roads, executive offices, and more support services. The period of greatest growth was from 1950 to 1970, when the population grew from 4,558 to 13,572.

===Dry to damp===
Wilton was classified as a &quot;dry&quot; town until 1993, when the local ordinance was altered to permit the sale of alcoholic beverages in restaurants. The town was then referred to as &quot;damp.&quot; On November 5, 2009, a referendum proposal was passed to allow liquor stores.

===Wilton deaths on September 11, 2001===
On September 11, 2001, four town residents died in the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center: Edward T. Fergus Jr., 40; Peter Christian Fry, 36; John Iskyan, 41; and Edward P. York, 45. Wilton High School graduate John Henwood, 35, also died in the attack.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.50%, is water, including the South Norwalk Reservoir. Wilton is bordered by Ridgefield to the northwest, Norwalk to the south, New Canaan to the southwest, Westport to the southeast, and Weston and Redding to the northeast. It is also bordered on the west by the hamlet of Vista in Lewisboro, Westchester County, New York.

=== Housing and land use ===
Wilton has about 500 surviving 18th- and 19th-century homes. In 2005, Marilyn Gould, the director of the Wilton Historical Society said:
People aren&#x27;t taking down historic houses but the more modest homes that were built in the &#x27;50s and &#x27;60s... What that&#x27;s doing is changing the affordability of the town and the demographic of the town. Wilton used to have a wide demographic of people who worked with their hands—artisans, builders, mechanics. Now it&#x27;s management and upper management.

Between 1999 and 2005, the town&#x27;s voters endorsed spending $23 million through municipal bonds to preserve land.

South Norwalk Electric and Water (SNEW) has a reservoir on the western side of town with about of land, along with another adjacent in New Canaan. In the fall, hunters with bows and arrows—no more than 10 at a time—are allowed to hunt deer on the Wilton property, in order to keep down the number of deer in the area.

Wilton town center contains several local restaurants, boutiques, retail stores .These stores were added around 2000 next to the old Wilton Center, which consists of the Wilton Library, the Wilton Post Office, the Old Post Office Square, and the Village Market. In the southern part of town, US 7 contains a business district.

Recent nature access developments in town include the expansion of the Norwalk River Valley Trail, a multi-use trail designed to run between Norwalk and Danbury.

Georgetown, which is primarily within the town but also extends into Redding and partly into Weston, is in the northeastern corner of town. Other neighborhoods in town are South Wilton, Wilton Center, Gilbert Corners, Cannondale, and North Wilton.

<text>Avon ( ) is a town in the Farmington Valley region of the Capitol Planning Region, Connecticut, United States. As of 2020, the town had a population of 19,795.

==History==
At the end of the last Ice Age, 12,400 years BP of the Younger Dryas, nomadic peoples built a campsite adjacent to the river that would become known as the Farmington River. They were apparently the first people to populate the region that would become known as southern New England, including the region that would become Avon. Over the Paleoindian period the site was revisted multiple times by other nomadic peoples until it gradually became buried by sediment from the river&#x27;s occasional flooding. In the winter of 2019, the campsite remains were excavated in Avon, along with stone tools and artifacts constructed from materials in neighboring regions.

Avon was settled by Europeans in 1645 and was originally a part of neighboring Farmington. In 1750, the parish of Northington was established in the northern part of Farmington, to support a Congregational church more accessible to the local population. Its first pastor was Ebenezer Booge, a graduate of Yale Divinity School who arrived in 1751. The Farmington Canal&#x27;s opening in 1828 brought new business to the village, which sat where the canal intersected the Talcott Mountain Turnpike linking Hartford to Albany, New York. Hopes of industrial and commercial growth spurred Avon to incorporate. In 1830, the Connecticut General Assembly incorporated Northington as the town of Avon, after County Avon in England. Such expansion never came and, in the 1900s, the rural town became a suburban enclave.

In the 1960s Avon rejected the proposal for Interstate 291 coming through the southern edge of the town and successfully denied the expressway going through the town.

U.S. Route 44 passes through a section of Talcott Mountain known as Avon Mountain, between Avon and West Hartford. Several vehicle crashes prompted the state to modify Route 44 for safety.

==Geography==

The East side of Avon is flanked by Talcott Mountain, part of the Metacomet Ridge, a mountainous trap rock ridgeline that stretches from Long Island Sound to near the Vermont border. Talcott Mountain is a popular outdoor recreation resource notable for its towering western cliff faces. The Metacomet Trail traverses the Talcott Mountain ridge.
The Western side of Avon is borders by the Farmington River with Huckleberry and Woodford Hills nearby, both hills are coved in suburban households, with Huckleberry hill having the Huckleberry Hill Recreation Area. Also on Woodford hill there is the Buckingham neighborhood. The center of town lies flatter that both the east and western parts of town, with both the middle and high school&#x27;s being in this area that West Avon is located in. More to the east is where the Farmington River also cuts through the town, right near the Avon Congregational Church and a large shopping area and Strip Mall&#x27;s following Route 44 and U.S. Route 202

<text>Berlin ( ) is a town in the Capitol Planning Region, Connecticut, United States. The population was 20,175 at the 2020 census. It was incorporated in 1785. The geographic center of Connecticut is located in the town. Berlin is residential and industrial, and is served by the Amtrak station of the same name. Berlin also has two hamlets: Kensington and East Berlin.

==Town seal==
The greatest boom to Berlin industry resulted from the decision of the Patterson brothers to start their business on West Street (now called Lower Lane). For twenty years until 1760, they kept their work in the family selling their wares from a basket. When demand increased they took apprentices into the shop and engaged peddlers to travel throughout the colonies selling the shiny, useful articles (the seal of the Town of Berlin shows such a &quot;Yankee peddler&quot; in eighteenth-century dress with a basket under his arm, a pack on his back full of tinware). As others learned the trade, they soon set up shop and hired apprentices. There were so many that the noise of the whitesmiths and their hammering could be heard in every part of town.

==History==

The town took parts away from Wethersfield (Now Rocky Hill and Newington), Middletown (Now Cromwell), Wallingford (Now Meriden) and Farmington (Now Southington and New Britain). Berlin was one of the birthplaces of interchangeable parts manufacturing and of the Industrial Revolution in the United States, in the workshop of Simeon North. The town was formerly known as Kensington.

In 1659, Sergeant Richard Beckley purchased 300 acres from Chief Tarramuggus, built a home for his family and became the first settler in what was to become Berlin. Other families slowly followed, and in 1686, Captain Richard Seymour led a group of families from Farmington to begin the first settlement on Christian Lane.

By 1705, the first ecclesiastical society was recognized and the area renamed the Great Swamp Society. The first meetinghouse and cemetery were established a few years later, and the first school house built in 1717.

1722 brought reorganization to the Society. Parts of the towns of Farmington, Wethersfield and Middletown were added to increase the land area, and the name changed to Kensington. In 1772, the Society was divided into an eastern half, called Worthington, and the western section, which retained the name of Kensington. 1785 brought incorporation of the town, which was then called Berlin. New Britain remained a part of Berlin until 1850.

Around 1740, Edward and William Pattison, two brothers from Ireland, emigrated to Berlin and set up the first tinware business in the colonies. Wares in baskets were pedaled from house to house, then, as surplus accumulated, by mule and wagon, traveling all over America and to Canada. This was the birth of &quot;The Yankee Peddler&quot;.

During the years from 1700 to 1750, farms, mills, and blacksmiths sprang up through the Great Swamp. Most residents of this area were skilled in one or more of these trades, which were recognized and allowed by the British government. A blacksmith was crucial for daily living needs such as nails, tools, hinges, latches, hooks, cranes, cooking utensils, and parts for wagons, wheels and sleds. Small ironworks sprang up near local waterpower.

In addition to tinware, ammunition was made from the local lead mines during the Revolutionary War. East Berlin Milling Co. produced cotton and woolen yarn which was spun into clothing and blankets. Simeon North, manufacturer of pistols, became the first official pistol maker for the United States Government when he developed a system of interchangeable parts for pistols. In the 1800s, business of all sorts thrived in Berlin. Makers of wagons, tableware, hats, clocks, books, combs, woolen clothes and blankets, cabinet and coffin makers, sleighs, muffs, and suits, were all local industries. Berlin was on the direct route from New Haven to Hartford, with taverns and inns, which were regular stagecoach stops for fresh horses, meals and sleeping accommodations.

Two meetinghouses had been built, one in Kensington Parish, still in use today as the Kensington Congregational Church. The Worthington Meetinghouse was in continuous use as a church, town hall, school and town offices until 1974.

Berlin was proud to have one of the 75 official post offices designated by Benjamin Franklin, first Postmaster General. A historic marker showing that the next post office was in Hartford, 11 miles away, is still located on Worthington Ridge.

By the late 1700s, a village library had been started, and the town boasted of five school districts. In the mid 1800s, the Worthington Academy was built, which ultimately housed 125 students from neighboring states. The Berlin Railroad Depot opened as a way station on the New York, New Haven and Hartford line. Today, this train station is one of the last places in the U.S. that sells tickets to anywhere in the U.S. or Canada.

The mid 1800s brought competition from mass-produced products, forcing the peddlers out of business. It also brought the establishment of the brick making industry locally, which eventually produced 90,000 bricks daily until the 1960s.

<text>Bloomfield is a suburb of Hartford in the Capitol Planning Region, Connecticut, United States. The town&#x27;s population was 21,535 at the 2020 census, Bloomfield&#x27;s highest decennial census count ever. Bloomfield is best known as the headquarters of healthcare services company Cigna.

== History ==
Originally land of the Poquonock Native Americans, the area was first settled in 1660 as part of Windsor, organized as the Parish of Wintonbury in 1736. Wintonbury comes from three names from neighboring towns Windsor, Farmington, and Simsbury. It was finally incorporated as the town of Bloomfield by the Connecticut General Assembly on May 28, 1835. Initially, the town&#x27;s local economy was agriculturally based, mostly in shade tobacco, remaining as such until it developed as a postwar suburb of Hartford starting in the 1950s. Today, Bloomfield&#x27;s local character varies. While the town&#x27;s southern and eastern fringes are more densely populated and developed, the northern and western sections maintain a more rural feel with meadows, woods, and some remaining farmland.

== Geography ==

Bloomfield is bordered by Windsor to the northeast, East Granby to the north, Simsbury and Avon to the west, and West Hartford and Hartford to the south.

The northern border of Bloomfield is formed by the Farmington River. The west side of the town is flanked by Talcott Mountain, part of the Metacomet Ridge, a mountainous trap rock ridgeline that stretches from Long Island Sound to nearly the Vermont border. Notable features of the Metacomet Ridge in Bloomfield include Penwood State Park and the Tariffville Gorge of the Farmington River, on the borders of East Granby, Simsbury, and Bloomfield. The Metacomet Trail traverses the ridge.

==Transportation==

Bloomfield also has two major north–south highways: Blue Hills Avenue (Route 187) and Bloomfield/Tunxis Avenues (Route 189). These highways merge when approaching the Windsor line but before returning to Bloomfield.

<doc id="108707" wikidata="Q1033861" url="?curid=108707" title="Canton, Connecticut">
<text>Canton is a town, incorporated in 1806, located in the Farmington Valley of Connecticut in the United States. It is part of Connecticut&#x27;s Capitol Planning Region and the population was 10,124 as of the 2020 census. It is bordered by Granby on the north, Simsbury on the east, Avon and Burlington on the south, New Hartford on the west, and Barkhamsted on the northwest. Running through it is the Farmington River. The town includes the villages of North Canton, Canton Center, Canton (Canton Valley), and Collinsville. In September 2007, Collinsville was ranked in &quot;Budget Travel&quot; magazine as one of the &quot;Ten Coolest Small Towns In America&quot;.

==History==
The name of Canton was officially designated on its incorporation in 1806. While assisting with the town&#x27;s organization, its name was given by Ephraim Mills, ancestor of Lewis S. Mills. There are two competing theories for Mills&#x27; source of the name, however.

According to William Edgar Simonds, husband of Ephraim Mills&#x27; great-granddaughter, and Sylvester Barbour in his book &quot;Reminisces&quot;, Canton&#x27;s name derives from canton, a Swiss administrative division. Simonds wrote that Canton &quot;... is derived from a supposed likeness to a Swiss canton, the meaning of the word being to divide or set off, and the partition from Simsbury made the name appropriate.&quot; Barbour instead noted that &quot;it came from Mr. Mills&#x27; interest in the Swiss people and their ardent patriotism, and was suggested to his mind by their territorial divisions into cantons. The name appealed to him, partly because of its pleasant sound, and its being so easy to read and write.&quot;

In an article within a 1903 issue of &quot;The Connecticut Magazine&quot;, Joel N. Eno claimed without a source that Canton&#x27;s name derived from Canton, an archaic name for Guangzhou, China. This claim has since been repeated by others, such as &quot;The Register Citizen&quot;, a Connecticut newspaper.

Other towns such as Canton, Massachusetts and Canton, Ohio have used the name for the town.

It separated from Simsbury in 1806. At the Collins ax factory in Collinsville, Elisha Root invented the important industrial technique of die casting.

<text>Collinsville is a village and census-designated place (CDP) in the town of Canton, Hartford County, Connecticut, United States. The population was 3,746 at the 2010 census. The central portion of the village is a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

It was built around the Collins Company Axe Factory, a manufacturer of edge tools, such as axes, machetes, picks and knives. Collins machetes were the brand of choice in South America. Collins tools were used almost exclusively for the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway, and axes and picks made their way across the country to be used in the California Gold Rush. Admiral Peary carried Collins tools to the North Pole.

Typical of New England mills, the Collins Company axe factory was sited on a river (the Farmington), and their production was powered by utilizing the water&#x27;s strength to turn turbines and power machines. The numerous old buildings ramble along the riverbanks intertwined by an intricate maze of sluices that run throughout the site. The company closed its doors in 1966, but the factory buildings stayed standing and are now rented out to local businesses. The ambiance of Main Street reflects period architecture with ornate details from the start of the 20th century.

==History==

According to historian Diana Muir, writing in &quot;Reflections in Bullough&#x27;s Pond&quot;, it was in Collinsville that Elisha Root invented the important industrial technique of die casting. Root was employed by Samuel W. Collins, whose Collins and Company was the largest manufacturer of axes in the nineteenth century. Other famous historical residents of Collinsville included George Washington Flint and William E. Simonds.

Collinsville hosts an annual Halloween Parade through the historic town. The parade is held on the last Saturday of October at 7 p.m. Children&#x27;s activities begin at 6 p.m.

Collinsville was voted one of the &quot;Top 10 Coolest Small Towns in America&quot; in the September 2007 issue of Arthur Frommer&#x27;s &quot;Budget Travel&quot; magazine.

==Sites==

Collinsville is located directly on the Farmington River, and is a common place for people to walk and bike to, due to its convenient location along the Rails to Trails path. There are many cultural attractions in this town center, including LaSalle Market and Deli. It was once known as Keney Market, operated as a small traditional grocery setting, serving breakfast and deli sandwiches, donuts, and candy and providing a variety of local newspapers. The name changed when a family member from LaSalle Market of LaSalle Road in West Hartford purchased the business and changed the name to LaSalle Market. Frequently on Sundays and other occasions, there are live music demonstrations in the parking lot outside.

The Canton Historical Museum is located in a former Collins Company factory building built in 1865. Originally constructed to finish and assemble agricultural plows, the building was converted in 1924 to a recreational facility for its employees. Fred Widen, a pattern maker for the company, used a portion of the building for his large collection of Collins memorabilia. Today, the Canton Historical Society owns the 14,000+ sq. ft. building and has a large assortment of Collins Tools, as well as many Victorian items, a general store, farm/agricultural equipment, children&#x27;s toys, looms, and a Bridal Parlor featuring wedding dresses worn by Canton residents from the late 1800s. Also of interest, are several Regina music boxes, a large pump fire engine, used by the Collins Company, an Edison phonograph and Edison fans. Upstairs, the Farmington Valley Railroad Society operates a railroad diorama of the village of Collinsville around the start of the 20th century.

A research and genealogical library containing thousands of documents and photographs related to Canton and Collinsville history is also located upstairs, including black and white photos of the 1955 flood. Information about local cemeteries in Canton and Collinsville are available in the library. The museum covers three floors with limited handicap accessibility, but plans are underway to make the building more accessible in the future.

In the 19th century, a Collinsville butcher feuded with his neighbor. To spite his neighbor, the butcher built between their adjoining houses a narrow, two-story structure with windows covered by Venetian blinds. The wooden building located between 23 and 25 River Street was the width of a standard stairway and allowed the butcher to block the sun to the neighbor&#x27;s home and block the neighbor&#x27;s view of the butcher&#x27;s property at will. The butcher&#x27;s son got along with the family next door and eventually tore down the Collinsville Spite House.

<text>East Granby is a town in the Capitol Planning Region, Connecticut, United States. The population was 5,214 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Original inhabitants of the current East Granby area were Native American peoples, including the Algonquin/Poquonock, the Massaco, and the Agawam.

The East Granby area was first settled by Europeans in 1664, which was one of the four Congregational parishes in Simsbury. The Turkey Hills Ecclesiastical Society in 1786 became a section of Granby, and in 1858 was incorporated as the Town of East Granby.

The first incorporated copper mine in America resided in what is now East Granby. The mine later became Old Newgate Prison, a Revolutionary War jail and the first state prison in the United States (1790).

Farming was the mainstay of the town for much of its history. The early twentieth century saw local farmers specializing in dairy product and tobacco.

East Granby experienced a housing boom that started in 1951 and resulted in a rise in population.

The town celebrated its 150th anniversary with a three-day festival June 7–9, 2008.

<text>East Windsor is a town in Hartford County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Capitol Planning Region. The population was 11,190 at the 2020 census. The town has five villages: Broad Brook, Melrose, Scantic, Warehouse Point and Windsorville.

==History==

In 1633, Settlers laid claim to the area now known as Windsor, which included East Windsor. No English settlers lived on the east side of the river. The first English settler in what is today known as East Windsor, was William Pynchon, the founder of Springfield, Massachusetts. In 1636, he erected a warehouse for his settlement&#x27;s transshipment of goods at what is now known as &quot;Warehouse Point&quot;. Warehouse Point served as the southern border of Springfield, Massachusetts, for 132 years—until 1768—when Warehouse Point, Connecticut, was annexed by the Connecticut Colony. Pynchon selected the site of Warehouse Point because of its location near the Enfield Falls—the first major falls in the Connecticut River, the head of navigation where seagoing vessels were forced to terminate their voyages and transship to smaller shallops. By constructing a warehouse at Warehouse Point, Pynchon essentially forced all northern Connecticut River business to run through him and his settlement at Springfield.

Meanwhile, most of today&#x27;s East Windsor was part of the prominent Windsor settlement on the east side of the river. Settlers avoided the East Side of the river due to the Podunk tribe who inhabited the area, particularly following King Philip&#x27;s War in 1675. Simon Wolcott was the first settler in today&#x27;s East Windsor. East Windsor also included today&#x27;s Ellington and South Windsor. Eventually on May 10, 1768, The East Windsor parish was partitioned from Windsor. The center of town became what is now East Windsor Hill in today&#x27;s South Windsor. The North Part of town center was Scantic.

In 1818, resident Solomon Ellsworth Jr, was blasting a hole for a well alongside his house in town. While in the process, he found some odd bones. These bones would later be sent to Yale University and eventually be identified as Dinosaur fossils, specifically one of an Anchisaurus. Though not the first fossils to be found, their discovery led to the dinosaur discovery craze later in the century as these were the first bones to be known as a dinosaur, four years before William Buckland determined it. The bones are still at Yale and the Ellsworth Homestead still stands on Rye Street near the South Windsor line.

In 1832, the Broad Brook Mill was created at the waterfall of the Mill Pond.

The town has five sections of town, Warehouse Point, Broad Brook, Scantic, Melrose, and Windsorville. The oldest section of town is Warehouse Point, which, as mentioned, was first used by William Pynchon in the 1630s, and later settled as part of Springfield in the 1680s. The Scantic section of town was the center of town until the mills were built. The Windsorville section of town was once its own community, featuring a church, post office, mini-mart, and a park. Mulnite Farms is a tobacco farm on Graham Road, established in 1905. In 1897, the town&#x27;s voluntary fire department was created in the mill. The Broad Brook Elementary school was established in 1951. In 1961, the town hall burned down. The new town hall is on Rye Street, across from the elementary school. The new volunteer fire department building and senior center was built on the same site of the old town hall. On Memorial Day Weekend 1986, the Broad Brook Mill caught on fire during renovations, with the mill and the tire shop (on the site of the mill) burned down and the smoke being seen as far as Bradley International Airport and Hartford. A new mini strip mall was built on the site of the mill.

==Geography==

East Windsor is bordered by the town of Enfield to the north, South Windsor to the south, Ellington to the east, and Windsor Locks and Windsor to the west, across the Connecticut River.

By virtue of its location on the Connecticut River, Windsor functioned as a vital port. Merchants on both sides of the river shipped timber products, brick, livestock, wheat, tobacco and other produce to supply plantations in the West Indies, importing sugar, molasses, salt, and British manufactured textiles, ceramics, hardware and glass on return trips. Windsor&#x27;s Hooker and Chaffee mercantile firm maintained a store and packing houses right off Windsor&#x27;s Palisado Green. Small scale shipbuilding took place at the mouth of the Scantic River in what is now South Windsor, Warehouse Point in what is now East Windsor, and along the Farmington from as far upriver as today&#x27;s village of Poquonock.

<text>Enfield is a town in Hartford County, Connecticut, United States, first settled by John and Robert Pease of Salem, Massachusetts Bay Colony. The town is part of the Capitol Planning Region. The population was 42,141 at the 2020 census. It is bordered by Longmeadow, Massachusetts, and East Longmeadow, Massachusetts, to the north, Somers to the east, East Windsor and Ellington to the south, and the Connecticut River (towns of Suffield and Windsor Locks) to the west.

==History==
Enfield was originally inhabited by the Podunk people, and contained their two villages of Scitico and Nameroke. Though land grants were first granted in 1674, no one attempted to settle what is known as Enfield until 1679 when the Pease Brothers of Robert and John II, settlers from Salem, Massachusetts came in to settle the fertile lands. They dug a shelter into a hill and camped there for the winter until their families came to help them build houses. In 1675, a sawmill owned by William Pynchon II was burned in the wake of King Phillip&#x27;s War. The first town meeting was held on August 14, 1679, and a committee of five were appointed by men from Springfield as it was the parent town at the time. Enfield was incorporated in Massachusetts on May 16, 1683, as the Freshwater Plantation, the same day as the town of Stow, Massachusetts, making them the 52nd/53rd towns in the Colony. The namesake is the Freshwater Brook (Also known as the Asnuntuck Brook) that traverses the town. Five years later, on March 16, 1688, the townspeople purchased Enfield from a Podunk named Notatuck for 25 pounds Sterling. It is unclear what claim Notatuck actually had to the land, or whether he was selling the land or the rights to use it. Shortly around 1700, the town changed its name to Enfield after Enfield in Middlesex, and to go with the other &quot;fields&quot; in the area such as Springfield, Westfield, and Suffield.

In 1734, the eastern part of town separated into the town of Somers. In 1749, following the settlement of a lawsuit in which it was determined that a surveyor&#x27;s error placed a section of present-day Hartford County (including Enfield) within the boundaries of Massachusetts, the town seceded and became part of Connecticut.

Jonathan Edwards preached his famous sermon, &quot;Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God&quot;, in Enfield. It was part of the Great Awakening revival that struck New England in the mid-18th century and spread throughout Western North American civilization.

The modern town of Enfield was formed through the merging of Enfield, Thompsonville, and Hazardville, named for Colonel Augustus George Hazard (1802–1868), whose company manufactured gunpowder in the Powder Hollow area of the town from the 1830s to the 1910s. In the 1989 film &quot;Glory&quot;, boxes of gunpowder can be seen with the words &quot;Enfield, CT&quot; printed on the sides. In an episode in the 1970s police drama &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, Jack Lord&#x27;s character Steve McGarrett traces explosives back to &quot;The Hazard Gunpowder Company- Enfield, CT&quot;. The capacity of the mill at the time of the Civil War was per day. Over 60 people died in explosions in Powder Hollow during the years when gunpowder was manufactured there. The mill blew up several times, but was set up so that if one building blew up, the rest would not follow in a chain reaction. The ruins of these buildings and the dams are open to the public. Powder Hollow is now home to baseball fields and hiking trails.

King&#x27;s Island in the Connecticut River, previously known as Terry Island (or Terry&#x27;s Island, or Great Island), was the location of pivotal meetings of Adventist Christians in 1872 and 1873.

In 1972, Asnuntuck Community College was established in Enfield as the twelfth institution in the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system (CSCU). Classes began in 1972 with an initial enrollment of 251, and 12 Associate in Science degrees and 20 Associate of Art degrees were awarded to the first graduating class in 1974.

There are five sections of the town of Enfield: Enfield Village, Thompsonville, Hazardville, Scitico, and Sherwood Village.

===Enfield Shaker village===
In 1793, a historic Shaker village, Enfield Shaker village, one of nineteen scattered from Maine to Kentucky, was established in the town. The Utopian religious sect practiced celibate, communal living, and is today renowned for its simple architecture and furniture. Membership eventually dwindled, however, and the village disbanded. The property has since been redeveloped by the Enfield Correctional Institution, still located on Shaker Road.

The gunpowder industry was founded by Colonel Augustus Hazard. Hazard was instrumental in implementing water power and other technologies to allow his business to prosper. Hazard&#x27;s company was among the biggest gunpowder suppliers for the American Civil War.

Enfield was the headquarters of Pilch Meat Breeders, which was once the second-largest broiler breeder in the world. The company was founded by Chester Pilch in 1936, and sold in 1969 to DeKalb Agricultural Research Corp. At its peak, Pilch owned 230 acres in Enfield, had farms in four countries, and produced about 24 million chickens a year. DeKalb moved the operation to North Carolina, taking 365 jobs from Enfield.

Enfield is currently the headquarters of Precision Camera and Video Repair as well as Control Module Industries.

The town contains several shopping centers, including the Enfield Square Mall.

<text>Farmington is a town in Hartford County in the Farmington Valley area of central Connecticut in the United States. The town is part of the Capitol Planning Region. The population was 26,712 at the 2020 census. It sits 10 miles west of Hartford at the hub of major I-84 interchanges, 20 miles south of Bradley International Airport and two hours by car from New York City and Boston. It has been home to the world headquarters of several large corporations including Otis Elevator Company, United Technologies, and Carvel. The northwestern section of Farmington is a suburban neighborhood called Unionville.

==History==
===Eighteenth and nineteenth centuries===
Farmington was originally inhabited by the Tunxis Indian tribe. In 1640, a community of English immigrants was established by residents of Hartford, making Farmington the oldest inland settlement west of the Connecticut River and the twelfth oldest community in the state. Settlers found the area ideal because of its rich soil, location along the floodplain of the Farmington River, and valley geography.

The town and river were given their present names in 1645, which is considered the incorporation year of the town. The town&#x27;s boundaries were later enlarged several times, making it the largest in the Connecticut Colony. The town was named &quot;Farmington&quot; on account of its location within a farming district.

Farmington has been called the &quot;mother of towns&quot; because its vast area was divided to produce nine other central Connecticut communities. The borough of Unionville, in Farmington&#x27;s northwestern corner, was once home to many factories harnessing the water power of the Farmington River.

Farmington is steeped in New England history. Main Street, in the historic village section, is lined with colonial estates, some of which date back to the 17th century. On May 19, 1774, in response to the adoption of the Boston Port Act, the people of Farmington assembled, held a mock trial for the bill, found the bill guilty of &quot;being instigated by the devil,&quot; and subsequently had a copy of the bill hung and then set on fire. During the Revolutionary War, George Washington passed through Farmington on several occasions and referred to the town as &quot;the village of pretty houses.&quot; In addition, French troops under General Rochambeau encamped in Farmington en route to Westchester County to offer crucial support to General Washington&#x27;s army.

===Nineteenth century===

The majority of Farmington residents were abolitionists and were active in aiding escaped slaves. Several homes in the town were &quot;safe houses&quot; on the Underground Railroad. The town became known as &quot;Grand Central Station&quot; among escaped slaves and their &quot;guides&quot;.

Farmington played an important role in the famous &quot;Amistad&quot; trial. In 1841, 38 Mende Africans and Cinqué, the leader of the revolt on the &quot;Amistad&quot; slave ship, were housed and educated in Farmington after the U.S. government refused to provide for their return to Africa following the trial. The Mende were educated in English and Christianity while funds were raised by residents for their return to Africa.

The Farmington Canal, connecting New Haven with Northampton, Massachusetts, passed through the Farmington River on its eastern bank and was in operation between 1828 and 1848. The canal&#x27;s right of way and towpath were eventually used for a railroad, portions of which were active up to the 1990s. Part of the canal and railroad line has now been converted to multi-use paved trails, called the Farmington Canal Heritage Trail and the Farmington River Trail, respectively.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.65%, is water.

After its founding, Farmington gave up territory to form Southington (1779), Bristol (1785), Avon (1830), Plainville (1869), and parts of Berlin (1785) and Bloomfield (1835). Farmington presently borders the towns of Avon, Burlington, Newington, West Hartford, and Plainville, and the cities of New Britain and Bristol.

Farmington is mostly wooded, but there are also meadows and hills in the east and southeast. There are also numerous ponds and lakes. The Farmington River runs through the town from the northwest from Burlington, enters Unionville, then takes a sharp turn near Farmington Center and flows north towards Avon. The Metacomet Ridge, a range of low traprock mountain ridges, occupies the east side of Farmington as Pinnacle Rock, Rattlesnake Mountain, Farmington Mountain, and Talcott Mountain.

The Jackson Laboratory of Bar Harbor, Maine, is building a new facility on the grounds of the University of Connecticut Health Center, which specializes in the research and development of genomic medicine. The project is part of BioScience Connecticut, an initiative designed to launch Connecticut into the forefront of biomedical research. A growing collection of doctor&#x27;s offices and medical practices is concentrated in the vicinity of the University of Connecticut Health Center.

Farmington is unique in that more people work within the town lines than actually live there, a characteristic atypical of a traditional suburb.

<text>Glastonbury ( ) is a town in the Capitol Planning Region, Connecticut, United States, formally founded in 1693 and first settled in 1636. It was named after Glastonbury in Somerset, England. Glastonbury is on the banks of the Connecticut River, southeast of Hartford. The town center is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as a census-designated place (CDP). The population was 35,159 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1636, 30 families settled in Pyaug, a tract of land belonging to Wethersfield on the eastern bank of the Connecticut River, bought from the Native American chief Sowheag for of trading cloth. In 1672, the General Court granted Wethersfield and Hartford permission to extend Pyaug&#x27;s boundary line to the east. By 1690, Wethersfield had permitted Pyaug residents to form a separate town and, the town of Glassenbury was created in 1693.

The ties have not been completely broken: the oldest continuously operating ferry in the United States still runs between South Glastonbury and Rocky Hill, also then part of Wethersfield, as it did as far back as 1655. One result of being split off from Wethersfield was that the town was built along a main road, rather than around the large green that anchors most New England towns. After part of New London Turnpike was realigned to eliminate the rotary in the middle of town during the mid-20th century, a small green was established there.

During the American Revolutionary War, several homes were used to hold classes from Yale University. Noah Webster was a student in these classes; later he taught at one of the town&#x27;s one-room schoolhouses.

Glassenbury freed its slaves in the 1780s, 60 years before Connecticut formally abolished slavery. The town organized its first library in 1803. It organized the first hospital shortly after the Revolution to combat and treat smallpox. By the end of the Revolution, there were ten schools, formed one by one during the 18th century.

During the American Revolution, George Stocking&#x27;s gunpowder factory operated in the town. In 1785, the town residents renamed Glassenbury to Glastenbury. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, Glastenbury was a shipbuilding town. Located on the Connecticut River, it had reliable waterpower and nearby hardwood forests of oak. Sawmills, charcoal kilns, and foundries developed around the shipyards to process timber and other goods for their needs.

As shipbuilding was ending, the early industrial beginning continued. The J.B. Williams Soap Factory started in 1840 in James B. Williams&#x27;s drugstore in Manchester, where he experimented with chemical formulas for shaving soap. When he had produced a formula that satisfied him, he moved his business to Glastenbury. Two years later, he was joined by his brother, William Stuart Williams. They formed what is believed to be the world&#x27;s first commercial soap manufacturing business. Although shaving soap was their first product, they also made ink and shoe blacking. The J.B. Williams Company&#x27;s products included Williams &#x27;Lectric Shave and Aqua Velva. Over time, J.B. Williams expanded to Montreal (around 1922), England, and Argentina. When the business was sold in 1957, ten former employees organized Glastonbury Toiletries and continued operation into the 1970s. J. B. Williams Park, on Neipsic Road, is named for James B. Williams.

Remaining parts of the industrial complex have been adapted for use as the Soap Factory Condominiums. Another portion was occupied by the Glastonbury Board of Education office and is now occupied by a translation company.

In 1870, the town&#x27;s name was changed from Glastenbury to Glastonbury, to match Glastonbury, England. During the World Wars, Glastonbury factories supplied leather and woolen goods to the military of Belgium, France, Great Britain, Italy, and the United States. In addition, Glastonbury has been a center for feldspar mills, cotton mills, paper mills, and silver plate factories. It also had an airplane building industry.

J.H. Hale Orchards began operations in 1866 in Glastonbury. John Howard Hale became known as the Peach King for developing a peach that could withstand New England winters and was disease-resistant, as well as for his operations&#x27; large, national scale. He also had land in Georgia and was the first Glastonbury industry to establish a branch outside the state. A marketing pioneer, Hale shipped peaches to markets all over the country. The orchard that started with in 1866 grew to more than by 1900.

Hale never went beyond grade school, but he initiated the founding of Storrs Agricultural College, now the University of Connecticut. He helped to organize the Glastonbury Grange and the State Grange. His home, at the intersection of Main Street and Route 17, has been adapted in the 20th century for use first as a restaurant and, more recently, for business offices.

Henry Saglio began a pioneering effort to breed a white chicken, because black pinfeathers were difficult to pluck from a bird headed for the dinner table. In 1948, the Saglio Brothers formed Arbor Acres and produced a broiler chicken that A&amp;P Food Stores awarded the title &quot;Chicken of Tomorrow&quot;. By 1958, Arbor Acres was selling globally. Today the brand is owned by Aviagen. In 1977, Henry Saglio was inducted into the Poultry Hall of Fame.

Glastonbury was also a major grower of broad-leaf tobacco. This agricultural tradition is carried on by the orchards and berry farms on its hills.

In 1993, Billy Joel filmed part of the video for his song &quot;The River of Dreams&quot; in a barn in South Glastonbury. The video also has a scene with the Rocky Hill-Glastonbury Ferry.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has an area of , of which is land and , or 1.76%, is water. The Glastonbury Center CDP has an area of , of which 3.30% is water.

The town begins on the banks of the Connecticut River and extends up into foothills, many of which provide a view of Hartford&#x27;s skyline. Some major developments in the town are built entirely on relatively steep hills, such as Minnechaug Mountain, the major residential area developed from the 1970s until late 1990s.

Part of Glastonbury resides in an area called Kongscut Mountain, locally called Rattlesnake Mountain, because it has a small population of timber rattlesnakes. Since that area is sparsely developed and mostly in a state forest, the snakes pose little threat.

The town has a small private lake, Diamond Lake, surrounded by growing subdivisions of large homes. Access to the lake is limited to members of the Diamond Lake Property Owners Association.

Glastonbury has one of the largest state forests, Meshomasic State Forest, a popular area for hiking, fishing, and hunting.

Glastonbury borders the town and cities of East Hartford, Wethersfield, Rocky Hill, Cromwell, Portland, East Hampton, Marlborough, Hebron, Bolton, and Manchester.

===Climate===

The town center experiences a humid continental climate (Dfa). However, the rural parts of the town, at an elevation of 800 feet near Bolton and Hebron, experience a colder climate which straddles the (Dfa) and (Dfb) lines.

<text>Granby is a town in northern Hartford County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Capitol Planning Region. The population was 10,903 at the 2020 census. The town center is defined as a census-designated place known as Salmon Brook. Other areas in town include North Granby and West Granby. Granby is a rural town, located in the foothills of the Litchfield Hills of the Berkshires; besides the suburban natured center, the outskirts of town are filled with dense woods and rolling hills and mountains. From the 1890s to the 1920s, many immigrants from Sweden came to reside in the town.

==History==

Granby was founded by people who lived in Simsbury and settled as early as 1723. Granby was part of Simsbury until 1786, when it became independent. The name is from Granby, Massachusetts in return, where it was named in honor of John Manners, Marquess of Granby.

Part of Southwick, Massachusetts, known as &quot;the Notch&quot; seceded from Massachusetts in 1774, just before the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. This territory became part of Granby when it seceded from Simsbury, but was returned to Southwick as part of an 1803–1804 border dispute compromise. (&quot;See History of Massachusetts.&quot;)

In 1707, Daniel Hayes (born – died 1756), then aged twenty-two, was captured and kidnapped by a hostile indigenous tribe and carried off to Canada. The capture was witnessed, and a rescue party raised, but the group did not catch up with the captors. He was tied up each night, and bound to saplings. It took thirty days to reach Canada, at which point Hayes was forced to run the gauntlet. Near the end of the gauntlet, he hid in a wigwam to avoid an attempted blow by a club. The woman in the wigwam declared that the house was sacred, and having lost a husband and son to a war, adopted Hayes as her son. He remained for several years, attending to the woman. Eventually, he was sold to a Frenchman, who learned that Hayes had skill as a weaver, so put him to work in that business. Hayes managed to earn enough to buy his freedom after two years. He then returned to Simsbury, settled down on a farm and married. He became prominent, both in civil affairs as well as the church at Salmon Brook (now Granby).

The first unauthorized coins minted in the American colonies, and the first in Connecticut, were struck by Dr. Samuel Higley in 1737 from copper mined from his own mine. The coins, including the Trader&#x27;s Currency Token of the Colony of Connecticut were minted in North Simsbury, now called Granby. These coins were made of pure copper, which is very soft. Consequently, there are very few in existence today. The first coins were inscribed with a value of three pence. Later versions carried the phrase &quot;Value me as you please.&quot;

In 1858, the eastern part of the town broke off and formed to become East Granby, the town is one of the newly established town in the state.

In 2009 &quot;Connecticut Magazine&quot; ranked Granby the #3 overall Connecticut small town (population 10,000–15,000) to live in, and #1 small town in Hartford County.

The town seal depicts the Dewey-Granby Oak, a large white oak estimated to be 450–500 years old, thought to be one of the oldest trees in New England.

Granby is warm and often humid in summer, with occasional thunderstorms, while winter can have heavy snow and cold temperatures. Snow and cold temperatures are not uncommon in early spring and late fall due to the town&#x27;s location in the Berkshires.

<doc id="108718" wikidata="Q2572348" url="?curid=108718" title="Hartland, Connecticut">
<text>Hartland is a town in Hartford County, Connecticut, United States. The population was 1,901 at the 2020 census. The rural town is part of the Northwest Hills Planning Region and forms the northwestern border of Hartford County. Currently, the town consists of two unincorporated areas, East and West Hartland, entirely separated by the northern portion of the Barkhamsted Reservoir. A third area, Hartland Hollow (also referred to as Hartland Center), was flooded when the reservoir was completed in 1940.

==History==
Originally referenced as the &quot;Western Lands,&quot; the unsettled area was the subject of a 37-year controversy over competing claims by the Connecticut Colony and the towns of Hartford and Windsor. After the Colony&#x27;s General Court was petitioned in 1724 to settle the dispute, it divided the lands among the three parties, which was followed by a confirming patent issued by Governor Joseph Talcott in 1729.

After another division agreement, Hartford&#x27;s proprietors were granted a patent in 1732 for four parcels encompassing the lands now known as Hartland, Winchester, and New Hartford. Land in Hartland was proportionally granted on the basis of Hartford&#x27;s 1720 Grand List. In 1733, the 67 landowners organized the Proprietors of Hartland association, and received a decree from the General Court for &quot;Hartford land,&quot; then shortened to Hartland.

In 1754, Captain/Deacon Thomas Giddings Jr II (1723 -1790) and his wife Mary Coult became the town&#x27;s first permanent settlers. In 1761, the 44 families of Hartland petitioned the General Court, and Hartland was incorporated as an independent town that same year.

==Geography==
The town is bisected by the Farmington River&#x27;s east branch which became the northern section of Barkhamsted Reservoir after construction of the Saville Dam in 1940. The reservoir and surrounding land, owned by the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) water authority, fills the hollow between East and West mountains.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 4.39%, is water. Bounded on the north by the Massachusetts border, Hartland is drained by the Farmington River, a tributary of the Connecticut River. The 42nd parallel north and the 73rd meridian west meet in the central western part of town.

Hartland is home to parts of three Connecticut State forests, Peoples State Forest, Tunxis State Forest, and American Legion State Forest The Barkhamsted Reservoir, which cuts through the middle of Hartland, is 11 miles long and holds approximately 30 billion gallon reservoir, and serves the primary source of drinking water for most of Hartford County. The construction of the reservoir and the Saville Dam required the relocation of over 1,000 people, four cemeteries, and numerous family farms in Hartland and Barkhamsted. In total, over 70% of Hartland&#x27;s land, or over 15,500 acres, is permanently designated as open space, encompassing state forests and parks, watersheds, and public land conservation trusts.

==Demographics==

As of the U.S. Census Bureau&#x27;s 2023 American Community Survey, there were 1,971 people and 818 households residing in the town. The population density was 60 people per square mile (23.2/km). There were 923 housing units, of which 840 (91%) were owner-occupied. The racial makeup of the town was 89% White, less than 1% African American, less than 1% Asian, 10% from other races and two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were less than 1% of the population.

The population distribution in 2023 was 18.82% (397) age 19 and under, 8.22% (162) ages 20 to 29, 9.79% (193) ages 30 to 39, 9.49% (187) ages 40 to 49, 19.13% (377) ages 50 to 59, 22.83% (450) ages 60 to 69, 6.50% (137) ages 70 to 79, and 3.45% (68) who were 80 years of age or older.

High school students can attend any of the CREC magnet schools, State of Connecticut vocational schools, State of Connecticut vocational-agricultural schools, the town-designated public high school (Granby High School as of 2019), or receive a voucher to attend another town public high school. Because of the wide variety in high school choice, four-year cohort graduation rates were not available. From 2013 to 2017, 73.1% of students attended public school, while 26.9% attended private school. By highest education level achieved as of 2017, 32% of the town earned a high school diploma, 12% an associate degree, and 32% bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher.

The remaining boards and committees, including Planning &amp; Zoning, Wetlands, and Recreation, are appointed by the Board of Selectman. Total Revenues for 2017 was $7,217,096, with total expenditures of $6,988,601 including $115,495 (1.7% of expenditures) for debt (bond) service. Hartland is rated A1 by Moody&#x27;s and conveys a mill rate of 25.50 on a net Grand List of $198,192,769. Of the net Grand List, 1.3% is commercial/industrial.

==Politics==
Hartland has published results for all presidential elections since 1856. From 1856 to 1876, Hartland supported Democratic candidates for president except for Abraham Lincoln received in the four-way race in 1860. Since 1880, Hartland voters have supported the Republican presidential candidate for 36 consecutive elections.

<text>Manchester is a town in Hartford County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Capitol Planning Region. As of the 2020 census, the town had a total population of 59,713. The urban center of the town is the Manchester census-designated place, with a population of 36,379 at the 2020 census. The town is named after Manchester, in England.

==History==

The area known as Manchester began its recorded history as the camping grounds of a small band of peaceful Native Americans known as the Podunk tribe. The area was settled by colonists around 1673, some 40 years after Thomas Hooker led a group of Puritans from Massachusetts Bay Colony to found Hartford.

At the time, the community was known as Orford Parish, a name that can still be found on the memorial to local Revolutionary War soldiers. The many rivers and brooks provided power for paper, lumber, and textile industries, and the town quickly evolved into an industrial center. The town of Hartford once included the land now occupied by the towns of Manchester, East Hartford, and West Hartford. In 1783, East Hartford became a separate town, which included Manchester in its city limits until 1823.

The Pitkin Glassworks operated from 1783 to 1830 as the first successful glassworks in Connecticut. The owner of the glassworks, Captain Richard Pitkin, was given a 25-year monopoly on glass as recompense for providing gunpowder to the Continental Army during the American Revolution. The Pitkin Glassworks Ruin has been preserved by the town&#x27;s historical society.

In 1838, the Cheney family started what became the world&#x27;s largest silk mill. Eventually, the Cheney family employed a quarter of residents and actively recruited immigrants to work in the mills. The manufacturing presence in the town made Manchester an ideal industrial community. The mills, houses of the owners, and homes of the workers are now part of the Cheney Brothers Historic District, a National Historic Landmark.

Also of note are the E.E. Hilliard Company Woolen Mills. Founded by Aaron Buckland and later sold to the Hilliard family, the Hilliard Mills are the oldest woolen mill site in the country.

===Manchester Fire department===
The Manchester Fire Department was created when Manchester Fire Rescue EMS and the Eighth Utilities District merged following a vote of the taxpayers of the Eighth Utilities District. The vote took place on February 1, 2023, with an official merger date of July 1, 2023. The Manchester Fire Department is a full-time career department that operates from seven firehouses. The department staffs four engine companies, one rescue engine company, two truck companies and a Battalion Chief with a minimum of 24 on-duty personnel consisting of 7 Lieutenants, 16 firefighters and 1 Battalion Chief. The department is an all hazards agency, providing a range of services including fire suppression, fire prevention, vehicle extrication, high and low angle rope rescue, confined space rescue, hazardous materials response, and Advanced Life Support (paramedic level) medical care.

==== Fire Department History====

=====Manchester Fire Rescue EMS=====

The Town of Manchester Fire-Rescue-EMS Department was organized in 1897 after a fire destroyed the Weldon business block. It was a full-time career department that operated from five strategically located firehouses. The department staffed three engine companies, one rescue engine company, one truck company, and a shift commander vehicle with a minimum of 17 on-duty personnel (five Lieutenants, eleven Firefighters, and one Battalion Chief). The department was an all hazards agency providing a range of services including fire suppression, fire prevention, vehicle extrication, high and low angle rope rescue, confined space rescue, hazardous materials response, and Advanced Life Support (paramedic level) medical care.

=====Manchester Fire Department-Eighth Utilities District=====

The Manchester Fire Department-Eighth Utilities District was a combination (paid and volunteer) fire department, established in 1888 as a separate fire department within the northwest corner of the town. It was not affiliated with the Town of Manchester government and was instead governed by its own board of directors. The department had four firefighters on duty 24/7, with coverage provided by full time career firefighters and part time paid firefighters. On the weekdays during the hours of 0800–1600, staffing increased with the addition of one full time career Assistant Chief and one full time career Firefighter/Mechanic. Volunteers provided additional coverage whenever available. The department provided fire suppression, fire prevention, rescue, hazardous material response, and Basic Life Support (EMT level) medical care.

===Police department===

The Manchester Police Department was established in 1896. It is staffed by approximately 120 officers. The department is led by Chief William Darby. 

The Manchester Police Department consists of 3 divisions, Field Services, Support Services, and Administrative Services.

The Field Services Division encompasses numerous aspects of the Manchester Police Department. The Patrol Lieutenants, Sergeants, and Officers, providing the Town of Manchester with public safety services all hours of that day and night, is the backbone of the agency.

Uniformed Services Section, commonly referred to as Patrol, provides 24-hour uniformed police coverage and services to the Town of Manchester, initiates preliminary investigations, investigates traffic collisions, and enforces traffic laws. In addition, the Field Services Division includes the PAR (Police Area Representative) Unit, Traffic Services Unit, SRO (School Resource Officer) Unit, K-9 Unit, CREST (Capitol Region Emergency Services Team), Animal Control Unit, and the Domestic Violence Outreach Team.

The Support Services Division comprises Communications Dispatch Center, Information Systems, Investigative Services Section, the Records Unit, Training Unit, and Property/Evidence. In addition, the Support Services Division includes recruitment, maintenance staff, equipment and safety, emergency management, buildings and grounds, fleet management, crossing guards, and quartermaster.

The Administrative Services Division is responsible for budgeting, grant management and professional standards. Also included in this division is the CALEA (Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies) Manager, Recruitment and Hiring, and the Field Training Unit.

Manchester Police Department is part of the Capital Region Emergency Services Team (Known as CREST). The Capital Region Emergency Services Team (CREST) is a multi-agency Regional Tactical Team staffed by dedicated and highly trained Officers from Manchester, Glastonbury, Vernon, South Windsor, Wethersfield, Enfield, East Windsor, Coventry, Rocky Hill, Cromwell and the University of Connecticut Police Department.

The mission of CREST is to provide a tactical response to critical incidents in member towns. The following are considered Critical Incidents handled by CREST:

Hostage Incidents, Barricaded Suspects, Sniper Situations, High Risk Arrests, High Risk Warrant Service, Special Assignments such as executive protection, event protection.
The Officers assigned to CREST have to undergo a rigorous selection process consisting of a physical fitness test, a firearms evaluation, and an oral board with current team leaders. Once selected, new team members must attend an 80 hour SWAT school to be considered operational. Once on the team, members attend supplemental training in many facets of tactical operations.

===Medical Transport===

Ambulance Service of Manchester (ASM) is a private, for-profit company that operates out of a station on New State Road in Manchester, and provides basic life support-level transport service. ASM also provides intercept and transport paramedic service to a number of towns in Hartford, Tolland, and Windham counties. ASM will provide advanced life support when fire department paramedics are unavailable.

<text>Marlborough is a town in Hartford County, Connecticut, United States. It contains the census-designated place (CDP) of Terramuggus. The town is part of the Capitol Planning Region. The town&#x27;s population was 6,133 at the 2020 census. Marlborough is a suburban and rural community. The local high school is RHAM High School. In 2013, Marlborough ranked third (of 24) in &quot;Connecticut Magazine&#x27;s&quot; biannual ranking of Connecticut small towns. Educationally, RHAM High School, which serves Marlborough, Hebron, and Andover students, is one of the top-ranked regional high schools in the state on the SAT in 2017, and 11th highest-performing school in the state on the test. The town is home to Elmer Theines-Mary Hall elementary school which serves Pre-K through 6th grade. The school scores above state average on standardized testing and student progress.

==History==

The earliest inhabitants of present-day Marlborough, prior to the arrival of the English settlers, were the Podunk people, an indigenous people who spoke an Algonquian language. The town&#x27;s origins can be traced back to 1648, when (John) Sadler&#x27;s Ordinary, a rest stop from the colonical era, was established. This establishment, the second of its kind in Connecticut Colony after Hartford, served as a crossroads during colonial times. Travelers would stop to rest at the Buell House (now the Marlborough Tavern) located at the heart of what is now Marlborough center. Although the original Sadler&#x27;s Ordinary (Inn) eventually went out of business, a new Sadler&#x27;s Ordinary was built in a new location in 1970 and continues to operate today.

In 1747, William Buell and Joel Foote petitioned the colonial General Court for permission to form an Ecclesiastical Society and establish the town of Marlborough. In 1749, they began constructing the First Congregational Church which was not completed until 1803. On October 13, 1803, Marlborough was officially incorporated, encompassing land from portions of three neighboring towns: Glastonbury, Colchester (New London County) and Hebron (Tolland County). The town took its name from Marlborough, Massachusetts, which was named after Marlborough, Wiltshire in England.

By 1907 the town had a population of fewer than 305 residents. It wasn’t until the 1960s that Marlborough was rediscovered as a bedroom community for 
white-collar professionals working in Hartford. A comprehensive history of the town titled &quot;Reflections Into Marlborough&#x27;s History&quot; was published in 2007.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.73%, is water. Marlborough is adjacent to four other Connecticut towns (Glastonbury to the north, East Hampton to the west, Colchester to the south, and Hebron to the east). East Hampton, Colchester and Hebron are each in different counties from each other and from Marlborough.

Route 2, a two-lane highway (sometimes three) in most sections, bisects the town, and there are three Marlborough exits, at South Main Street, Route 66, and West Road, although there are exits westbound only for South Main and eastbound only for West Road. It takes approximately 15– 20 minutes to get to Hartford, 40 minutes to New London, 45 minutes to New Haven, and 40 minutes to Springfield, MA. Marlborough is generally equidistant between Boston and New York. Boston is an hour and 45 minutes away, while New York City is a two-hour car ride, pending traffic conditions. Popular vacation areas are also reasonable drives from Marlborough. The Berkshire Mountains are an hour and 20 minutes away, and popular Rhode Island beaches, depending on which one you go to, are an hour (Misquamicut, Westerly) to an hour and 20 minutes away (Narragansett).

<doc id="108723" wikidata="Q2578454" url="?curid=108723" title="Office québécois de la langue française">
<text>The  (, OQLF; ) is an agency of the Quebec provincial government charged with ensuring legislative requirements with respect to the right to use French are respected.

Established on 24 March 1961 by the Liberal government of Jean Lesage, the OQLF was attached to the Ministry of Culture and Communications. Its initial mission, defined in its report of 1 April 1964, was &quot;to align with international French, promote good Canadianisms and fight Anglicisms, ... work on the normalization of the language in Quebec and support State intervention to carry out a global language policy that would consider notably the importance of socio-economic motivations in making French the priority language in Quebec&quot;.

Its mandate was enlarged by the 1977 &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot;, which established two other organizations — the Toponomy Commission and the Superior Council of the French Language — as well as by amendments since made to the Charter, most significantly, the 2022 reform.

== History ==
The creation of a Board of the French language was one of the recommendations of the Tremblay Royal Commission of Inquiry on Constitutional Problems which published its five-volume report in 1956. Such an institution was part of the list of 46 vows formulated by the Second Congress on the French Language in Canada held in Quebec City in 1937.

In 1961, the &quot;Act to Establish the Quebec Ministry of Cultural Affairs&quot; was passed, providing for the creation of the &quot;Office de la langue française&quot; (Office of the French Language) (OLF). The OLF&#x27;s mission aimed at ensuring the correct usage of French and the enrichment of the spoken and written language. In 1969, the &quot;Act to Promote the French Language&quot; was passed, which expanded the mandate of the OLF and introduced the notion of the right to work in French.

In 1974, the &quot;Official Language Act&quot; was adopted, which strengthened the status and use of French in Quebec and gave the OLF a decisive role in the implementation of its provisions. In 1977, the &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot; was passed. The first mandatory language law, it incorporates and broadens several elements of the &quot;Official Language Act&quot; and substantially enhances the status of the French language in Quebec. For its implementation, the Charter establishes, in addition to the OLF, the Toponymy Commission, the Monitoring and Inquiry Commission and the French Language Council.

The OLF was renamed (Quebec Office of the French Language) (OQLF) pursuant to the adoption of Bill 104 by the National Assembly of Quebec on 12 June 2003, which merged the OLF with the French Language Protection Commission) and part of the French Language High Council. Now entrusted to the OQLF were two new mandates: the handling of complaints and the monitoring of the linguistic situation. The OQLF has since created two committees each chaired by a member of its Board: the Linguistic Officialization Committee and the Linguistic Status Monitoring Committee.

On 1 June 2022, the OQLF gained new powers with the National Assembly&#x27;s adoption of the &quot;An Act Respecting French, the Official and Common Language of Quebec&quot;, which amended the &quot;Charter&quot;, creating additional obligations for organizations and businesses to fulfil the right to work and be served in French.

== Mission and powers ==
Sections 159 to 164 of the &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot; define the mission and powers of the OQLF:
* Section 159: to define and conduct Quebec&#x27;s policy pertaining to linguistic officialization, terminology and francization of public administration and businesses;
* Section 160: to monitor the linguistic situation in Quebec and to report thereon to the Minister at least every five years;
* Section 161: to ensure French is the normal and common language of work, communication, commerce and business in the civil administration and businesses;
* Section 162: to assist and inform the civil administration, semipublic agencies, businesses, associations and bodies corporate with regard to the correction and enrichment of spoken and written French in Québec;
* Section 163: to establish the research programmes needed for the application of the &quot;Act&quot;; and
* Section 164: to enter into agreements or take part in joint projects with any person or agency.

In 2004, the organization had a yearly budget of $17.8 million. In 2005-2006, the budget rose to $18.5 million, in 2007-2008 to $19.0 million and to $24.453 million in 2018-2019.

== Members ==

As of July 2024, the OQLF&#x27;s eight Board members, each appointed by the government for a term of up to five years, were:

* Dominique Malack, Chief Executive Officer of the OQLF;
* Alain Bélanger, Associate Professor, Urbanization, Culture and Society Centre, National Institute of Scientific Research;
* Denis Bolduc, Secretary General, Quebec Federation of Labour;
* Juliette Champagne, Deputy Minister, Quebec Ministry of the French Language;
* François Côté, Lawyer;
* Chantal Gagnon, Associate Professor, Commercial Translation, University of Montreal;
* Tania Longpré, Francization Teacher, Lecturer and Doctoral Student on language instruction, University of Quebec - Montreal; and
* Frédéric Verreault, Executive Director, Corporate Development, Chantiers Chibougamau Ltd.

== Services ==
In exercising its mandate, the OQLF offers the following services to the population of Quebec:

* General information service via a toll free line, website and brochures;
* Francization services:
** francization counselling (for businesses of 50 employees or more), and
** technical assistance relating to Francization of information technologies;
* Processing complaints of non-compliance with the law;
* Terminology and linguistics tools and services:
** the &quot;Grand dictionnaire terminologique&quot; (Comprehensive Terminological Dictionary),
** the &quot;Banque de dépannage linguistique&quot; (Language helpdesk), and
** personalized terminological and linguistic consultation;
* Publications of the OQLF:
** &quot;Le français au bureau&quot; (French at the Office), a book for the general public pertaining to administrative and commercial writing, and
** Terminology works: dictionaries, lexicons addressed principally to specialists;
* Libraries: one in Montreal and the other in Quebec City; and
* Evaluation of French competency for candidates to Quebec&#x27;s professional associations.

== Awards ==
Many distinctions are given by the OQLF to reward persons and organizations contributing to the survival of the French language in the Americas. They are given as part of the Grand Gala of French Awards which occurs each year, usually in March during the FrancoFête.

Since 1998, the OQLF has been rewarding outstanding francization efforts by persons and organizations in the form of awards in the areas of &quot;work&quot;, &quot;business&quot; and &quot;information technologies&quot;.

Since 1999, in collaboration with the Quebec Artists&#x27; Union, the Writers&#x27; Union and the Radio, Television and Film Authors&#x27; Association, the OQLF has included an awards category for &quot;culture&quot;.

Since 1999, in place of the former French language award, it awards the Camille-Laurin Prize to underline a person&#x27;s effort in promoting the usefulness and quality of French in his or her social milieu.

Since 2005, in collaboration with the Quebec-France Association and the Quebecers&#x27; National Movement, it awards the Quebec-France Marie-Claire-Blais Literary Prize to a French writer for his or her first work.

In collaboration with Quebec&#x27;s Ministry of Immigration, it presents awards in the area of &quot;newcomer francization&quot;, including for a &quot;non-francophone newcomer&quot;, a &quot;person working in the field of newcomer francization&quot;, a &quot;community of institutional partner in francization&quot; and a &quot;business&quot;.

The Chair of the OQLF presides over the Jury of the Dictée of the Americas, an international competition of French spelling created by Télé-Québec in 1994.

== Complaints ==
Residents of Quebec alleging a violation of their linguistic rights &quot;to be informed and served in French&quot; can file a complaint, for which the OQLF which is responsible for processing. As per section 168 of the &quot;Charter&quot;, the complaint must be written in French and contain the identity of the complainant. The OQLF ensures privacy of information as required under the &quot;Act Respecting Access to Documents Held by Public Bodies and the Protection of Personal Information&quot;. The OQLF does not have the power to send an agent to investigate unless it has received a complaint or there has been a vote by the members of the OQLF.

In 2022-2023, the OQLF received a record number of complaints of possible violations of the &quot;Charter&quot;. In total, 6,884 complaints were filed, which represented a 9% increase over the previous year and a 145% increase over five years. The main issues identified were language of service (34%), language of websites (11%) and language of public display (17%). 85% of the complaints were resolved without resorting to legal sanctions.

==Controversy==

The OQLF was created to enforce the everyday use of the French language in Quebec. The OQLF promoted the Quebec Charter of the French Language and, prior to 1988, was responsible for enforcing a regulation whereby French was the only language authorized on outdoor commercial signage. After multiple successful legal challenges, the role of the OQLF has since changed to ensuring French is the &quot;predominant&quot; language, meaning at least twice the size of any and all other languages.

The OQLF has been referred to in English as &quot;tongue troopers&quot; The term &quot;language police&quot; was possibly first used by the American television show 60 Minutes, which ran an investigative report on Quebec language laws. Legally, the organization has no police powers, instead relying on the threat of fines or the withholding of a company&#x27;s &quot;francisation certificate&quot; as enforcement techniques.

According to the statistics of the OQLF, 95% of all complaints judged to be valid are resolved without resorting to legal action. In an average year, the OQLF receives between 3000 and 4000 complaints from citizens. Forty to fifty percent of these complaints have to do with commercial products for which there is no available French manual or packaging, 25% have to do with signage in stores, 10% with websites and 5% with the language of service.

The OQLF once took action against Schwartz&#x27;s, Dunn&#x27;s, and other stores retailing imported kosher goods that did not meet its labelling requirements, an action perceived in the Jewish community as an unfair targeting and antisemitism. This coincided with high-profile cases brought by the OQLF against Schwartz&#x27;s and Dunn&#x27;s due to the apostrophe in the establishment&#x27;s sign, which remains. Schwartz&#x27;s, along with Dunn&#x27;s and other well-known delicatessen establishments, also fought a ruling to change the name of &quot;smoked meat&quot; to &quot;boeuf mariné&quot; in order to conform to the law. They won the ruling on appeal by proving that if they didn&#x27;t advertise &quot;smoked meat&quot; they would confuse and anger customers. For example, National Assembly Member for the Parti Québécois Gérald Godin once ordered the sandwich by its English name. Under the new ruling, enacted in 1987, &quot;smoked meat&quot; became a term in both official languages of Canada.
The majority of criticism directed at the OQLF is due to a perceived overzealous nature in the application of its mandate. Some recent examples include:
* Citing a Montreal restaurant for having a small &quot;recommended on Tripadvisor&quot; sticker in the bottom corner of a window. The complaint was that the sticker was in English and there was no French version displayed.
* Issuing a letter of complaint to the owner of a board game store for mostly selling board games with English packaging, though French versions did not exist for the majority of the games in question.
* Demanding the town of St. Lazare remove &quot;Welcome&quot; from the town&#x27;s welcome signs, leaving only the French version, &quot;Vous accueille&quot;, though one-third of the town&#x27;s residents were native English speakers. The town instead opted to remove all words from the welcome sign.
* Citing a small business in Chelsea for replying in English to English comments on the store&#x27;s Facebook page without writing a second, French version of the response.
* Citing a restaurant that specializes in grilled cheese for having &quot;Grilled cheese&quot; on their sign rather than the French version &quot;sandwich au fromage fondu&quot;.
* Forcing a hospital in the Gaspé region of Quebec to remove all bilingual directional signage, despite the presence of a large English speaking population. The health and safety information signs are allowed to be bilingual, though.
*Rejecting a complaint against OQLF because the complaint was written in English instead of French. Quebec Ombudsman later overruled OQLF&#x27;s decision, pointing out under Quebec&#x27;s French-language charter, government agencies can respond to citizens in &quot;a language other than French&quot;.

One case that gained international attention in 2013 was dubbed &quot;Pastagate&quot;, in which the OQLF cited an Italian restaurant for using the word &quot;Pasta&quot; on its menu instead of the French word &quot;pâtes&quot;. After receiving negative coverage throughout the world including the US and Europe, the OQLF eventually backed down, admitting to being &quot;overzealous&quot; and stating they will perform a review of the way these types of complaints are handled.

== Today ==
Originally, the &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot; required that all commercial signage be in French and no other language. In 1988, in &quot;Ford v. Quebec,&quot; the Supreme Court of Canada ruled this was against the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. After massive protests in support of the legislation, the Bourassa Government invoked section 33 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, the notwithstanding clause, allowing the language laws to override the charter for a period of five years, after which they would be reviewed.

In 1993, the United Nations Human Rights Committee concluded in &quot;Ballantyne, Davidson, McIntyre v. Canada&quot; that it was outside of the Quebec government&#x27;s jurisdiction to limit freedom of expression in a language of the person&#x27;s choice. (See Legal dispute over Quebec&#x27;s language policy.) Also in 1993, but not due to the UNHR ruling, Quebec reviewed the law and modified its language regulations to require that French be &quot;markedly predominant&quot; on exterior business signs, as suggested by the Supreme Court of Canada ruling in the case of &quot;Ford v. Quebec&quot;.

<text>Rocky Hill is a town in Hartford County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Capitol Planning Region. The population was 20,845 at the 2020 census. It was originally land of the Wangunks (a tribe of Native Americans). Europeans began to settle the area of Rocky Hill in 1650, as part of Wethersfield, the neighboring town to the north. In 1722, the area became known as Stepney Parish, until it was independently incorporated in 1843. Rocky Hill’s location on the Connecticut River made it a natural port for Wethersfield and an early center for shipbuilding, agriculture, and trade.

Rocky Hill is a typical bedroom community, as many residents commute to work in the larger urban centers of Hartford to the north and New Haven to the south.

Rocky Hill is the home to the Dinosaur State Park. Rocky Hill also was once the headquarters of Ames Department Stores, which ceased business operations in 2002.

<text>Simsbury is a town in Hartford County, Connecticut, United States, incorporated as Connecticut&#x27;s 21st town in May 1670. The town is part of the Capitol Planning Region. The population was 24,517 in the 2020 census.

==History==

===Early history===

At the beginning of the 17th century, the area that would become known as Simsbury as of 1670 was inhabited by indigenous peoples. The Wappinger were one of these groups, composed of eighteen bands that were organized not formally as a tribe, but more akin to an association, like the Delaware. These bands lived between the Hudson and Connecticut rivers. The Wappingers were one of the Algonquian peoples, a linguistic grouping which includes hundreds of tribes. One of the Wappinger bands, the Massaco, lived near, but mostly west of, what became known as the Farmington River, in the area that would become known as Simsbury and Canton, the latter as of 1806. 

In 1633, Windsor was the second town in Connecticut settled by Europeans and the first English settlement (the first European settlement being Huys de Goede Hoop, established by the Dutch in the Hartford area as a frontier settlement for the New Netherland Colony ten years earlier). For some time, the area of Massaco was considered &quot;an appendix to the towne of Windsor.&quot; Settlers in Windsor forested and farmed in the area, but did not settle in Massaco permanently for a number of years. In 1642, the General Court of the colony of Connecticut ordered that:

the Governor and Mr. Heynes shall have liberty to dispose of the ground uppon that parte of Tunxis River cauled Mossocowe, to such inhabitants of Wyndsor as they shall see cause.
 Despite this order, there is no record that any settlements immediately ensued. Five years later the General Court issued another order:

The Court thinks fitt that Massacoe be purchased by the Country, and that ther be a Committee chosen to dispose of yt to such inhabitants of Wyndsor as by the shalbe judged meet to make improuement therof...

but there is no record of land grants arising from this order.

In 1643, John Griffin and Michael Humphrey started a tar and turpentine business in Windsor. A few years later, a Massaco Indian named Manahanoose started a fire which destroyed tar belonging to Griffin. The Court ordered the payment of &quot;five hundred fathom of wampum&quot; as compensation. As he was unable to pay this amount, Manahanoose was instead ordered by the Court to either serve Griffin or be exchanged for Black slaves. To avoid this, he instead delivered a deed to the land at Massacoe. The deed was agreed to by Manahanoose as well as other Indians, identified as &quot;the proprietors of Massaco&quot;. In 1653, the General Court granted of meadowland to Lieutenant Aaron Cook, to John Bissell and to Thomas Ford, all in Massacoe.

Settlers did not build permanent settlements until the following decade. Aaron Cook built one of the early homes in the area established 1660 as Terry&#x27;s Plain, and John Griffin also built a home, possibly in 1664—the date associated with a deed to land in Massacoe. The settlement of Massacoe continued in the late 1660s. The General Court awarded a land grant of two hundred acres to John Griffin in 1663. A deed description from 1664 indicates he had become a permanent inhabitant. In 1669, a survey found that there were thirteen permanent residents of Massacoe. One of those residents, John Case, was appointed to the position of constable. This is the first recorded civil office held by residents of the area.

===Incorporation===
In 1670, John Case, along with Joshua Holcomb &amp; Thomas Barber, presented a petition to the General Court, requesting that Massacoe become a town of the colony of Connecticut. On May 12, 1670, the General Court granted the petition, and ordered that the plantation should be called &quot;Simmsbury&quot;. The boundaries at that time were Farmington on the south and Windsor on the east, with the extent of Simsbury running north of Farmington and west of Windsor. The northern border, subject to dispute with Massachusetts, was left to be resolved later. This area includes the township Simsbury as well as Granby and Canton, which would later separate from Simsbury in 1786 and 1806, respectively.

The precise origin of the name of the town is not known for certain. The town records covering the first ten years after incorporation were accidentally burned in 1680 and 1681. One possibility is that the name of Simsbury comes from the English town of Symondsbury. Holcomb, one of the petitioners, originally came from Symondsbury. Another possibility is that the name was derived from Simon Wolcott&#x27;s name. He was known familiarly as &quot;Sim&quot;, and he was considered one of the prominent men of the town.

===King Philip&#x27;s War===
In 1675, rumors of unrest among the indigenous peoples began to surface. The rumors proved accurate, and King Philip&#x27;s War, a war between a number of tribes and the New England settlers, began in the summer. The war extended through parts of four colonies, with Simsbury on the western edge of the conflict. At the time, it was seen as a frontier settlement. The conflict was largely over by August 1676, although it did not formally end until a treaty was signed in 1678.

The colony of Connecticut formed a Council of War. In the days leading up to the war, they ordered settlers to keep night watches and to work in the fields in armed groups of at least six. By the time of the colony&#x27;s General Court meeting of October 14, 1675, the situation was considered serious enough that the court ordered the residents of Simsbury to move to safety in Windsor. The order read:
In March 1676, the town of Simsbury was first pillaged, then burned to the ground. This destruction has been described as the most extensive of any event of any Indian War in New England. The settlers remained in Windsor until the spring of 1677, during which most moved back to Simsbury, though some never returned.

=== Daniel Hayes ===
In 1707, Daniel Hayes, then aged twenty-two, was captured by indigenous people and carried to Canada. The capture was witnessed and a rescue party was raised, but the group did not catch up with the captors. Hayes was tied up each night and bound to saplings. It took thirty days to reach Canada, where Hayes was forced to run the gauntlet. Near the end of the gauntlet, he hid in a wigwam to avoid an attempted blow by a club. The woman in the wigwam declared that the house was sacred and, having lost a husband and son to a war, adopted Hayes as her son. He remained for several years, attending to the woman. Eventually, he was sold to a Frenchman, who learned that Hayes had skill as a weaver and put him to work in that business. Hayes managed to earn enough to buy his freedom after two years. He then returned to Simsbury, settled down on a farm and married. He became a prominent figure in civil affairs, as well as the church at Salmon Brook (now Granby).

===Patent Safety Fuse factory explosion===

On Tuesday, December 20, 1859, the two-story Patent Safety Fuse factory located near the center of town exploded, killing seven women and one man. The blast also injured several other people, including the factory owner. The factory made cord fast-burning fuses used for blasting, which resulted in the explosion. Two days later, on Thursday, December 22, 1859, the &quot;New York Times&quot; ran a story about the explosion.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.09%, is water.

Simsbury lies in the northern end of the Farmington Valley. The east side of Simsbury is flanked by Talcott Mountain, which is part of the Metacomet Ridge, a mountainous trap rock ridgeline that stretches from Long Island Sound to near the Vermont border. Notable features of the Metacomet Ridge in Simsbury include Heublein Tower, Talcott Mountain State Park, Penwood State Park, and the Tariffville Gorge of the Farmington River. The Metacomet Trail traverses the ridge. At the western foot of the mountain, the Pinchot Sycamore, the largest tree in Connecticut, grows near the Farmington River. Simsbury also has some patches of old-growth forest; Belden Forest, a 40-acre site with public hiking trails near the center of town was inducted into the Old-Growth Forest Network in October 2019.

The town is often considered a bedroom community for the nearby city of Hartford, Connecticut, which is a 20 to 25 minute drive from Simsbury Center; however, many residents also commute to other towns and cities within the west-central Connecticut region.

===Principal communities===
After the complete destruction of the town in 1676 during King Philip&#x27;s War, there were three late 17th to early 18th century nucleated resettlement communities: East Weatogue (also called East Simsbury), Simsbury Center, and Terry&#x27;s Plain.

There are four census-designated places in Simsbury: Simsbury Center, Tariffville, Weatogue, and West Simsbury.

<text>South Windsor is a town in Hartford County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Capitol Planning Region. The population was 26,918 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1659, Thomas Burnham (1617–1688) purchased the tract of land now covered by the towns of South Windsor and East Hartford from Tantinomo, chief sachem of the Podunk Indians. Burnham lived on the land and later willed it to his nine children. Beginning in the middle of the 17th century, a few settlers from Windsor began using land on the east bank of the Connecticut River for grazing and farming purposes. By 1700, a number of families had made their homes in the area. In 1768, the residents of the area were allowed to incorporate as the separate town of East Windsor, though the area was informally referred to as East Windsor before this time. At the time, the town included all of what is now the present-day towns of East Windsor, South Windsor, and Ellington. Known for its agriculture and ship building, the town of East Windsor, including South Windsor, supplied more than 200 volunteers during the American Revolution. In 1786, Ellington became an independent town, and South Windsor was incorporated as a separate town in 1845. Tobacco has been a major crop grown in South Windsor since its founding.

(Old) Main Street, located near the Connecticut River and running north to south from the border of East Windsor to that of East Hartford, is the center of the town&#x27;s historic district. The Wood Memorial Library &amp; Museum and Ellsworth School are located on the street. Minister Timothy Edwards, the namesake of the town&#x27;s middle school, is buried in a cemetery located on this street. In 1698, Edwards became the first minister for the settlers on the east side of the river, and his church was built on Main Street (in present-day South Windsor). His son, theologian Jonathan Edwards, was born in South Windsor (at the time still part of Windsor). Ulysses S. Grant stayed at a home on the street.

The town has become less and less agricultural and rural since 1950. This former farming community has been transformed into a suburban town with industrial and commercial districts. The town&#x27;s population more than tripled between 1950 and 2000. In the early 1990s, residents mobilized a successful campaign against a proposed nuclear waste dump located near the East Windsor town line.

==Education==

Children attending the public school systems in South Windsor begin at the elementary school level (Kindergarten through Grade 5) at one of four elementary schools: Pleasant Valley, Orchard Hill, Philip R. Smith, and Eli Terry, with Wapping now used by the local recreation department, instead of previously running as a school. After graduating from elementary school, students then move on to Timothy Edwards Middle School, for grades 6–8. They also have the choice to go to a magnet school, Two Rivers Magnet Middle School in East Hartford. They then finish up their schooling at South Windsor High School. Over 140 students in the 2004, 2005, and 2006 classes have been admitted to the University of Connecticut in Storrs.

==Government and politics==
===Town council===

South Windsor is governed by a council-manager form of government. The town manager is appointed by the town council and the leader of the council is designated as the mayor, with a deputy mayor also chosen from amongst the council.

The town council holds its elections every two years, on odd-numbered years. Each party nominates only up to six candidates for the nine town council positions (which are all at-large), and each voter may only vote for up to six candidates from the pool of all candidates nominated by all parties. The top nine vote-getters win seats on the town council; as a result the council always has a 5–4 or 6–3 majority (assuming only two parties are participating), ensuring representation of the minority party.

<text>Southington ( ) is a town in Hartford County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Capitol Planning Region. As of the 2020 United States Census, it had a population of 43,501. Southington contains the villages of Marion, Milldale, and Plantsville.

==History==

Although Southington was formally established as a town in 1779, its roots go back to a much earlier time. Samuel Woodruff, Southington&#x27;s first white settler, moved from Farmington to the area then known as &quot;Panthorne&quot; that was settled in 1698. The land was formerly occupied by the Tunxis or Sepores Indians. The settlement grew, prospered, and came to be known as &quot;South Farmington&quot; and then later, the shortened version, Southington.

The town&#x27;s most important early visitor was General George Washington, who passed through the town in 1770 on his way to Wethersfield.

The Marion section of Southington is one of the most historic places in the town. It is the site of an encampment by the great French general, Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau, and his troops during the American Revolutionary War. In June 1781, the French troops under Rochambeau&#x27;s command left Farmington and marched to their eighth camp through Connecticut, near Asa Barnes Tavern in the Marion section of Southington, now the Marion Historic District.

They camped there for four days. Rochambeau and his officers took shelter in the tavern, and the troops set up camp on a hill on the other side of the road. The area of the encampment has since become known as French Hill, and a marker on the east side of Marion Avenue commemorates the French campsite. According to Rev. Timlow&#x27;s &quot;Sketches of Southington&quot; (1875), &quot;Landlord Barnes gave a ball at his tavern, at which a large number of the young women of the vicinity were present; and they esteemed it something of an honor to have had a &#x27;cotillion&#x27; with the polite foreigner.&quot; The celebrations-infused with spirits provided by Landlord Barnes-spanned the four nights they were in Southington. Rochambeau revisited Barnes&#x27;s Tavern on the return march on October 27, 1782. According to Timlow, coins, buttons and other things were picked up in the vicinity many years after the two encampments. The Asa Barnes Tavern is now a private residence very near the camp site at 1089 Marion Avenue.

Southington originally was a small, rural farming community. In the early 1900s, Southington developed as a manufacturing center, but still maintained a very small population of a few thousand residents. Some of the products invented there include the first cement that was able to harden under water, the first carriage bolt cutting machine, the break-neck rat trap, and a new tinware process.

With the overall decline of industry in New England, and the construction of Interstate 84 in the mid 1960s, Southington developed into a bedroom community in which the town saw explosive growth and a population that has surged to over 42,000 today. 28% of the workers in Southington are still employed in manufacturing, most of them in the production of fabricated metals and aircraft.

In May 1942, during World War II, the town was selected by the War Department to be highlighted in a defense booklet called &quot;Southington, CT—Microcosm of America.&quot; Photographers roamed the community taking photos of residents at work, at play and in their homes and churches. The final publication was intended to show friends and foes alike in Europe the typical American citizens and families, their traditions and values. Thousands of copies were dropped from military airplanes over Europe during the Nazi German Occupation. Also in 1942 the mural, &quot;Romance of Southington&quot;, was painted in the town post office by Ann Hunt Spence. Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department. The WPA was the largest and most ambitious American New Deal agency, employing individuals to carry out public works projects.

Each year, Southington is home to the Apple Harvest Festival, an effort to bring together local businesses and denizens from the area and surrounding cities. This has been a tradition of the town since 1969, generally spanning six weekdays and two weekends. Its highlights include a town parade, carnival rides and games, musical performances, and a wide selection of unique recipes and foods served by community cornerstones including the Boy Scouts of America, local churches, the Southington Fire Department and Police Department, the Southington Rotary Chapter, and the Southington Jaycees. Southington is home to several farms and apple orchards, including Rogers Orchards, the largest in the state.

On May 24, 1962, the town was heavily damaged by a high-end F3 tornado. The tornado, which was &quot;near-F4&quot; intensity at the time, damaged or destroyed numerous buildings, homes, businesses, and vehicles throughout the area before it dissipated northeast of town. Overall, the storm left one dead and 50 injured.

Two of Southington&#x27;s main state roads are ceremonially named for notable residents. Southington&#x27;s portion of Route 10 is named the Louis G. Tolles Memorial Highway for the late state Grange leader and legislator (1885–1956). The road was dedicated on August 6, 1960, and rededicated with new signs on October 6, 2007. A section of Route 364 (Oakland Road and Berlin Street) was dedicated as the Officer Timothy Foley Memorial Highway on September 11, 2009, in honor of the first Southington police officer killed in the line of duty. He died six days after being struck by a vehicle on December 30, 1937.

In January 2011, John Weichsel retired as town manager after 44 years. He was hired by the first Town Council when the council/manager form of government was established in town in 1966. His tenure as a town manager in the same community is one of the longest in the United States. Weichsel died in 2013. The municipal center at 196–200 North Main St. is named in his honor.

==Geography==

Southington is situated about southwest of Hartford, about northeast of New York City, southwest of Boston and west of Providence. It includes the areas of Plantsville, Marion and Milldale, each of which has its own post office and distinct architecture. The town rests in a valley, with two mountains on its east and west sides. The town is located along exits 28 through 32 of Interstate 84, exit 4 of Interstate 691, and bisected by Connecticut Route 10. Southington has the nickname of &quot;The Apple Valley&quot;, due to the many orchards that still dot its landscape. The Quinnipiac River flows through the town. It is home to Mount Southington ski area, which has drawn visitors since the 1960s.

Southington is located at geographical coordinates 41° 35′ 48&quot; North, 72° 52′ 40&quot; West (41.596588, −72.87767). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.99%, is water.

The Metacomet Ridge, a rugged trap rock mountain ridge that extends from Long Island Sound to the Massachusetts/Vermont border, passes through Southington. Notable peaks along the ridge form the eastern edge of town: Bradley Mountain, Ragged Mountain, Short Mountain, and part of the Hanging Hills. The ridge is traversed by the Metacomet Trail.

Southington&#x27;s west ridge is rich with many geological formations. These include North Hamlin Brook, Roaring Brook, and Soltys Pond. Soltys Pond was named after Alexander Soltys, who settled in the area in 1713. The most well-known geological formation in the area is one of several in the world known as the Great Unconformity.

Located less than one mile northwest of the Great Unconformity on Southington Mountain is Hushak Rock, which has been known informally for decades as White Rock. The overlook has expansive views of the region and can be seen from much of Route 229 and area neighborhoods. The state of Connecticut officially named Hushak Rock in 2017 for longtime Southington civic leader and World War II pilot Walter J. Hushak (b. 1923).

===Revitalization===

As industry in the area declined, many old factories and buildings were left vacant. The latest to close was Ideal Forging, which filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and vacated its building in the town center. In 2005, Meridian Development Partners of New York City purchased the land with plans to transform the former factory site into homes and retail space. Demolition of the factory began in October 2014, but the project was later abandoned because of the high cost necessary to decontaminate the soil. As of 2023, preparations have begun for a new attempt at developing the space. The soil decontamination for the most recent plan has been subsidised by the EPA, the state, and the town.

Southington has taken the initiative to spur its own revitalization. In 2002, the town completed the downtown renaissance project. This project replaced the sidewalks on Main Street and Center Street with granite curbing and brick paving stones. Lifelong resident and philanthropist Robert Petroske donated $50,000 to the revitalization effort which led to the installation of decorative iron lamp posts, benches, and garbage cans. Flowering trees were planted, and a former fountain and light fixture was restored and relocated from Recreation Park (where it had been moved in 1961) to the town center. A renaissance zone was created where private business owners in the zone could apply to the town to continue the project of granite, brick pavers, and lamp posts, of which the town would pay the difference of replacement concrete sidewalks versus the more expensive brick. The extension of brick pavers from Center Street to a section on the east side of Liberty Street was completed in July 2008 to connect with the pavers installed outside the new Liberty Square office building.

The town water department, which built a new facility on West Queen Street in 2002, demolished its former facility located between Mill and High streets in June 2008 and developed the land into a landscaped park, along with a continuation of the sidewalks, iron fences and decorative lamp posts. The old water facility abuts the linear walking trail.

==Parks and recreation==
Southington boasts a fair share of large parks and open land, each serving several outdoor activities, and as a whole, a vast array of them.

===Linear walking trail===
The linear trail opened to the public in the summer of 2003. This trail was built over the town&#x27;s old rail line which had ceased operation several years earlier. Dubbed the Farmington Canal Greenway, when completed it will stretch from New Haven, Connecticut, to Northampton, Massachusetts, following the route of the historical Farmington Canal. The second phase of construction on the trail, which officially opened in 2011, redeveloped the old train line from Plantsville center to the Cheshire town line. 

The project has brought landscaping, iron benches, and intersections of brick pavers where the trail crosses roads. This is seen as a major link for the further revitalization of downtown Southington and Plantsville. Eventually the trail will connect with the Cheshire-to-New Haven route.

==Government==

In state government, Southington is divided into the following districts for the Connecticut House of Representatives: 30, 80, 81 and 103; it is part of district 16 for the Connecticut Senate.

At the federal level, Southington is located in Connecticut&#x27;s 1st congressional district. The district&#x27;s current Representative is John B. Larson, a Democrat.

Locally, the Town of Southington has a form of government known as Council-Manager Government. It consists of a nine-member Town Council, elected every odd year through an at-large popular vote. Due to state minority representation laws, a maximum of six nominees from each party can run. The nine candidates who receive the most votes become councillors. The council appoints a nonpartisan full-time administrator, known as the Town Manager.

Voters also elect a municipal Planning and Zoning Commission (four year terms), Board of Education (two year terms), Board of Finance (two year terms), Water Commission (two year terms), Town Clerk (six year term) and Registrar of Voters (four term term).

==Education==
Southington has eight public elementary schools, two middle schools and one high school. It also has an alternative school for children in grades 8–12 called the Karen Smith Academy. Approximately 6,500 students are enrolled in Southington public schools, making it one of the larger districts in the state of Connecticut. Southington High School has a growing enrollment exceeding 2,200 students, of which 90% of graduates attend post-secondary education.

Due to Southington&#x27;s popularity as a family suburb, the town has undertaken plans to expand all schools to accommodate the growing enrollment. Three elementary schools have been completed, and a new building and second cafeteria has been added to the high school campus. In 2012, voters approved expansion and renovations to two other elementary schools (with one to be demolished and rebuilt), as well as to the two middle schools.

<text>Suffield is a town in Hartford County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Capitol Planning Region, and located in the Connecticut River Valley. As of the 2020 census, the population was 15,752. The town center is a census-designated place listed as Suffield Depot.

Bordering Massachusetts, Suffield is part of the Springfield, Massachusetts NECTA. It was once within the boundaries of Massachusetts.

==History==
Originally known as Southfield—pronounced &quot;Suffield,&quot; on May 20, 1674, the committee for the settling of the town petitioned:

The petition was granted by the Massachusetts Bay court on June 8, 1674. Suffield was incorporated as a town in March 1682.

Also, on early 17th and 18th century maps, Suffield was alternatively spelled as Suthfield.

Suffield and the surrounding area were part of the Equivalent Lands compromise with Massachusetts in 1715–1716.

Suffield&#x27;s native and adopted sons include The Rev. Ebenezer Gay, a renowned Congregational minister; U.S. Postmaster General Gideon Granger; real estate speculator Oliver Phelps, once the largest landowner in America; composer Timothy Swan; architect Henry A. Sykes; sculptor Olin Levi Warner; Seth Pease, surveyor of the Western Reserve lands in Ohio, most of which were controlled by Suffield financiers and speculators; and Thaddeus Leavitt, inventor of an early cotton gin, merchant and patentee of the Western Reserve lands. Thanks to the town&#x27;s early prominence and wealth, it boasts an astonishing collection of early New England architecture. The Kent family, for whom the town&#x27;s library is named, originated in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and boasted relations to many prominent early New England families, including the Dwight family of Northampton, Massachusetts, the Hooker family of Hartford, the Dudleys of Guilford, Connecticut, and the Leavitts of Suffield. Descendants of Robert Olds, who arrived from Sherborne, Dorset, in 1667, include automotive pioneer Ransom Eli Olds, Copperhead Ohio politician Edson Baldwin Olds, his great-grandson USAAF General Robert Olds, and his son, iconic USAF fighter pilot Robin Olds.

Slavery was common throughout the Connecticut River Valley during the 18th century, and the 1774 Census for the Colony of Connecticut listed 37 slaves in Suffield. Throughout the Connecticut Valley, wealthy merchants, tavern owners and town ministers owned slaves. When Major John Pynchon originally purchased from the Pequonnocks and Agawam tribes a six-mile tract of land, which he called Stoney Brooke Plantation, he first ordered the construction of a sawmill, and used two of his slaves, Harry and Roco, for the construction. Suffield&#x27;s third minister, Reverend Ebenezer Devotion, became minister in 1710, and &quot;sixteen years later the town voted to give him £20 to purchase a slave. Reverend Ebenezer Gay, Devotion&#x27;s successor, owned six slaves throughout his long term, 1742–1796. Reverend Ebenezer Gay Jr. manumitted his family&#x27;s three remaining slaves in 1812. They were Titus, Ginny and Dinah. &quot;Princess,&quot; a slave belonging to early Suffield settler, Lieut. Joshua Leavitt, died November 5, 1732. Some of Leavitt&#x27;s descendants became ardent abolitionists, including Joshua Leavitt and his cousin Roger Hooker Leavitt, who operated an Underground Railroad station in Charlemont, Massachusetts.

One of the earliest graduates of the Yale Medical School was one of Suffield&#x27;s earliest physicians. Dr. Asaph Leavitt Bissell, born in 1791 at Hanover, New Hampshire, to parents originally from Suffield, attended Dartmouth College, and later graduated in the second class of the Yale Medical School. Bissell moved to Suffield, where he rode horseback to make house calls on his patients. Bissell&#x27;s saddlebags are today in the collection of the Yale Medical School&#x27;s Historical Society.

Two bridges span the river to the town of Enfield: the Amtrak/Springfield Terminal Railroad Bridge and the Enfield–Suffield Veterans Bridge.

The Metacomet Ridge, a mountainous trap rock ridgeline that stretches from Long Island Sound to nearly the Vermont border, runs through the center of Suffield from south to north as West Suffield Mountain. The Metacomet Trail traverses the ridge.

<text>Tariffville is a neighborhood and census-designated place (CDP) in the town of Simsbury in Hartford County, Connecticut, United States. The population was 1,324 at the 2010 census. It is a popular location for whitewater paddlers who use the Farmington River.

Part of the original mill village area is included in the Tariffville Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The historic district excludes newer development around West Point Terrace and Hayes Road, as well as properties along White Water Turn, Wooster Road, and Main Street Extension. The historic district is architecturally significant for preserving some evidence of early nineteenth-century mill village characteristics (in retaining some old mill housing and street layout) and for also preserving later 19th-century Greek Revival and Gothic Revival structures.

==Geography==
Tariffville is in the northeastern corner of the town of Simsbury, on the inside of a sharp bend in the Farmington River. The northeastern and northwestern borders of the CDP follow the river, with the northeastern part also forming the town line with East Granby. The southeastern border of the CDP follows the crest of Talcott Mountain and is the town line with Bloomfield. The southern border of the CDP follows a line just south of West Point Terrace, from Talcott Mountain back down to the river.

Connecticut Route 189 (Hartford Avenue) runs through the eastern end of Tariffville, leading north to Granby and south to Hartford. Connecticut Route 315 passes through the center of Tariffville as Elm Street and Tariffville Road.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 7.98%, is water.

==History==
In 1825 (or 1827), the Tariff Manufacturing Company built a carpet mill along the Farmington River, giving its name to the area. The company name came from the Tariff Act of 1824 which included protective tariffs for a number of products, including wool and cotton textiles. The area did not have sufficient housing for the workers, so the company built housing, some of which survives today. The carpet business survived for a few decades, but by 1867, the primary industry in the area was sorting and packing of tobacco. The tobacco business would continue as the chief industry through the 1930s. The town was the site of a major rail accident, the Tariffville train crash, in 1878.

The first steel manufacturing plant in the country was established in Tariffville at a site on the Farmington River in 1727.

Initially its product was largely flat-woven ingrain carpeting, an inexpensive type of carpeting, but over time it added more expensive weaves, such as three-ply ingrain and loop brussels. The mill had 230 looms in operation as of 1846.
Carpeting continued to be manufactured in Thompsonville until 1971, by which time most production had shifted to the southern United States.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 12.99%, is water. Thompsonville is located on the east bank of the Connecticut River and is bounded by Interstate 91 to the east. U.S. Route 5 (Enfield Street) is the main road through the village, leading north to Longmeadow, Massachusetts, and into Springfield, and south through East and South Windsor to East Hartford. Connecticut Route 190 crosses Route 5, leading west across the Connecticut River into Suffield and east to Hazardville.

<text>Bonaire ( , ; ) is a Caribbean island in the Leeward Antilles, and is a special municipality (officially &quot;public body&quot;) of the Netherlands. Its capital is the port of Kralendijk, on the west (leeward) coast of the island. Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao form the ABC islands, 80 km (50 miles) off the coast of Venezuela. The islands have an arid climate that attracts visitors seeking warm, sunny weather all year round, and they lie outside the Main Development Region for tropical cyclones. Bonaire is a popular snorkeling and scuba diving destination because of its multiple shore diving sites, shipwrecks and easy access to the island&#x27;s fringing reefs.

As of 1 January 2024, the island&#x27;s population totaled 25,133 permanent residents, an increase of over 8.592 since 2012. The island&#x27;s total land area is ; it is long from north to south, and ranges from wide from east to west. A short west of Bonaire across the sea is the uninhabited islet of Klein Bonaire with a total land area of . Klein Bonaire has low-growing vegetation including cactus (Papiamentu: &quot;kadushi&quot;), with sparse palm trees near the water and is bordered by white sandy beaches and a fringing reef. The reefs, beaches and on-island reserves located on both Bonaire and Klein Bonaire are under the protection of the Bonaire National Marine Park, and managed by STINAPA Bonaire.

Bonaire was part of the Netherlands Antilles until the country&#x27;s dissolution in 2010, when the island became a special municipality (officially, a &quot;Caribbean public body&quot;) within the country of the Netherlands. It is one of three special municipalities in the Caribbean; the others are Sint Eustatius and Saba. 80% of Bonaire&#x27;s inhabitants are Dutch nationals, and nearly 60% of its residents were born in the former Netherlands Antilles and Aruba.

== Etymology ==

The name &#x27;Bonaire&#x27; is thought to be derived from the Caquetio word &quot;&#x27;Bonay&quot;″, meaning &#x27;low country&#x27;. The early Spanish and Dutch modified its spelling to &quot;Bojnaj&quot; and also &quot;Bonaire&quot;. French influence, while present at various times, was never strong enough to make the assumption that the name means &#x27;good air&#x27;. According to another theory, the name might be derived from the Spanish phrase &quot;buen aire&quot;, which does mean &#x27;good air&#x27;, as the Spanish were the first Europeans to colonise the island.

==History==

===Original inhabitants===
The most accurate human remains on the islands, dating from 4500 BP (2550 BC), were found in Curaçao. On different islands the most accurate are 4000 BP (2050 BC) in Aruba and 3300 BP (1350 BC) in Bonaire. These individuals are currently called by the term Archaic Indians. The Caquetío (Arawak) Indians, a clan of the Arawak language family, arrived at the islands from South America around 500 AD. Archeological remains of the Caquetio culture have been found at certain sites northeast of Kralendijk and near Lac Bay. Caquetio rock paintings and petroglyphs have been preserved in caves at Spelonk, Onima, Ceru Pungi and Ceru Crita-Cabai. The Caquetios were apparently a very tall people, for the Spanish name for the ABC islands was &quot;&#x27;las Islas de los Gigantes&quot;″ or &#x27;the islands of the giants&#x27;.

=== Spanish period ===

In 1499, Alonso de Ojeda arrived in Curaçao and a neighbouring island that was almost certainly Bonaire. Ojeda was accompanied by Amerigo Vespucci and Juan de la Cosa. De La Cosa&#x27;s Mappa Mundi of 1500 shows Bonaire and calls it &quot;Isla do Palo Brasil&quot; or &quot;Island of Brazilwood&quot;. The Spanish decided that the three ABC Islands were useless because they did not have known metal deposits, and in 1515 the Caquetío were enslaved to work in the copper mines of Santo Domingo on the island of Hispaniola; the total number may have been between 500 and 2,000.

Spain colonized Bonaire since 1499 for a period of approximately one century. Likewise, one of the oldest references to the name of the island is found in the archive of the Main Public Registry of the city of Caracas (Venezuela). A document dated December 9, 1595, specifies that Don Francisco Montesinos, Curate and Vicar of &quot;las Yslas de Curasao, Aruba y Bonaire&quot; conferred a power of attorney to Pedro Gutiérrez de Lugo, resident in Caracas, to collect from the Royal Treasury of His Catholic Majesty Don Felipe II, the salary that corresponded to him for his office as priest and vicar of the islands.
Remnants of Bonaire&#x27;s indigenous population can be seen in some of the island&#x27;s current inhabitants. In fact, the majority of the population is of mixed black and white descent, with minorities of Europeans (descendants of the Dutch) and Africans (descendants of slaves)

In 1526, Juan Martínez de Ampiés was appointed Spanish commander of the ABC Islands. He brought back some of the original Caquetio Indian inhabitants to Bonaire and Curaçao. Ampies also imported domesticated animals from Spain, including cows, donkeys, goats, horses, pigs and sheep. The Spaniards thought that Bonaire could be used as a cattle plantation worked by natives. The cattle were raised for hides rather than meat. The Spanish inhabitants lived mostly in the inland town of Rincon as its geography made it relatively safe from pirate attacks .

===Dutch period===
The Dutch West India Company was founded in 1602. Starting in 1623, ships of the West India Company called at Bonaire to obtain meat, water and wood. The Dutch also abandoned some Spanish and Portuguese prisoners there, and these people founded the town of Antriol, which is a contraction of Spanish &quot;al interior&quot; (English: &quot;inside&quot;). The Dutch and the Spanish fought from 1568 to 1648 in what is now known as the Eighty Years War. In 1633, the Dutch having lost the island of St. Maarten to the Spanish retaliated by attacking Curaçao, Bonaire and Aruba. Bonaire was conquered in March 1636. The Dutch built Fort Oranje in 1639.

While Curaçao emerged as a centre of the slave trade, Bonaire became a plantation of the Dutch West India Company. Salt became a major export product of the island; a small number of African slaves were put to work alongside Indians and convicts, cultivating dyewood and maize and harvesting solar salt around Blue Pan. Slave quarters, built entirely of stone and too short for a man to stand upright in, still stand in the area around Rincon and along the salt pans. The slave population grew in the 1710s when a famine and social unrest on Curaçao caused the Dutch to relocate a large number of slaves to Bonaire. Historically, Dutch was not widely spoken on the island outside of colonial administration; its use increased in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Students on Curaçao, Aruba and Bonaire were taught predominantly in Spanish until the late 18th century when the British took Curaçao, Aruba and Bonaire; the teaching of Spanish was restored when Dutch rule resumed in 1815.

During the Napoleonic Wars, the Netherlands lost control of Bonaire twice, once from 1800 to 1803, and again from 1807 to 1816. During these intervals, the British had control of the neighbouring island of Curaçao and of Bonaire. The ABC islands were returned to the Netherlands under the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814. During the period of British rule, a large number of white traders settled on Bonaire, and built the settlement of Playa (Kralendijk) in 1810.

==== Emancipation ====

From 1816 until 1868, Bonaire remained a government plantation. In 1825, there were about 300 government-owned slaves on the island. Gradually many of the slaves were freed and became freemen with an obligation to render some services to the government. The remaining slaves were freed on 30 September 1862 under the Emancipation Regulation. A total of 607 government slaves and 151 private slaves were freed at that time.
====World War II====
During the German occupation of the Netherlands during World War II, Bonaire was a protectorate of Britain and the United States. The American army built the Flamingo Airport as an air force base. After Germany invaded the Netherlands on May 10, 1940, authorities declared martial law, and many German and Austrian citizens, as well as Dutch thought to be German sympathizers, were interned in a camp on Bonaire. Some of these remained in this camp for the war&#x27;s duration, and others were transferred to new camps built on the mainland in the first year of the war. In 1944, Princess Juliana and Eleanor Roosevelt visited the troops on Bonaire.

Bonairean sailors made an above-average contribution during World War II. German U-boats tried to eliminate shipping around the Aruba and Curaçao refineries and thus eliminate the island&#x27;s considerable fuel production for the Allies. Bonairean-crewed ships also took part in these battles. Among the many missing after the war, were the 34 Bonaireans who died on these ships (more than on the other islands of the then Dutch West Indies). During hostilities, the site where the Divi Flamingo Beach Resort &amp; Casino now stands served as an internment camp for Germans and Austrians living in the Antilles, mainly because they were distrusted. There were fears they could have sabotaged the giant oil refineries on Aruba and Curaçao that were supplying paraffin to the Allied air fleet.

The camp was in operation from 1940 to 1947. In total, 461 people were interned during this period without trial, most of them completely innocent. Among them were Medardo de Marchena and also the photographer Fred Fischer, then still an Austrian citizen. Many German internees had just fled Nazi violence. But there were also German prisoners of war, some of whom remained after the war. In September 1943, the father of George Maduro, after whom Madurodam is named, asked Queen Wilhelmina to exchange his son for the German internees on Bonaire. The government did not grant the request. After the war, the empty barracks became Bonaire&#x27;s first hotel: Zeebad.
====Post-war====
After the war, the economy of Bonaire continued to develop. The airport was converted to civilian use and the former internment camp was converted to become the first hotel on Bonaire. The Dutchman Pierre Schunck started a clothing factory known as Schunck&#x27;s Kledingindustrie Bonaire, a partial solution for the large female surplus on the island. In 1964, Trans World Radio began broadcasting from Bonaire. Radio Netherlands Worldwide built two shortwave transmitters on Bonaire in 1969. The second major hotel (Bonaire Beach Hotel) was completed in 1962. Salt production resumed in 1966 when the salt pans were expanded and modernized by the Antilles International Salt Company, a subsidiary of the International Salt Company. Part of the facilities extend into the Caribbean Sea and form the popular dive site known as Salt Pier. The Bonaire Petroleum Corporation (BOPEC) oil terminal was opened in 1975 for trans-shipping oil.
Politically Bonaire formed part of the Netherlands Antilles from 1954 to 2010; it is now a special municipality within the Netherlands. In 2011 the island officially adopted the US dollar as its currency.

===Dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles===

On 10 October 2010, the Netherlands Antilles was dissolved. As a result, the government of the Netherlands assumed the task of public administration of the Caribbean Netherlands or BES Islands comprising Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba. The three islands acquired new status as &quot;special municipalities&quot; (&quot;bijzondere gemeenten&quot;), making them part of the Netherlands itself, a form of &quot;public body&quot; (&quot;openbaar lichaam&quot;) as outlined in article 134 of the Dutch Constitution. Special municipalities do not constitute part of a province.

As a special municipality, Bonaire is very much like ordinary Dutch municipalities in that it has a mayor, aldermen and a municipal council, and is governed according to most Dutch laws. Antillean legislation remained in force after 10 October 2010, with the exception of those cases where Antillean law was replaced by Bonaire&#x27;s municipal law. It was believed best for the island to not introduce the entire body of Dutch legislation at one time as it would cause confusion. Therefore, Dutch legislation is being introduced in stages. Bonaire retained its own unique culture while residents enjoy the same rights as Dutch citizens, including the right to vote in Dutch parliamentary elections in the Netherlands. Residents also have access to new or improved facilities and government benefits including, but not limited to, universal health care; improved health care facilities; better educational facilities with additional training for teachers, new teaching methods and new school buildings; social housing for low-income individuals and families; a centrally dispatched single police force, fire department and ambulance service. While the three islands are considered to be land of the Netherlands, they are not a part of the European Union, therefore not subject to European Union Law. They are considered to be an overseas country and territory.

Bonaire&#x27;s non-governmental organization, &quot;Nos Ke Boneiru Bèk&quot; (&quot;We Want Bonaire Back&quot;), is against the current constitutional relationship with the Netherlands. With reference to Bonaire&#x27;s 2004 referendum, the organization is of the opinion that such an arrangement was never the choice of the people. The Dutch Minister of Home Affairs and Kingdom Relations, Ronald Plasterk, replied to the organization confirming that only the &quot;Island Councils in the Caribbean Netherlands have the authority to decide on holding a constitutional referendum, not the Dutch government.&quot; In response, the organization gathered more than 3,500 signatures in 2013 favouring a new referendum. In a letter to minister Plasterk, James Finies, chairman of Nos Ke Boneiru Bèk, requested a &quot;new referendum under the right of self-determination&quot;. Plasterk responded by advising Finies that preparations for the evaluation of the public entity structure had begun for 2015, but a &quot;possible change of the constitutional relations is not part of that evaluation&quot;. The new referendum took place on 18 December 2015. 65% of the turnout voted that they were not happy with the current relationship between Bonaire and the Netherlands.

==Geography==
Bonaire lies about off the coast of Venezuela. The island has a land area of , with an additional added by Klein Bonaire, a small uninhabited island off its west coast.

The northern end of Bonaire is relatively mountainous, although its highest peak, Mount Brandaris, is only . The southern part of the island is nearly flat and barely rises above sea level. A significant portion of this southern region is covered with sea water in process of evaporation for salt production. This area also contains Lac Bay with its large mangrove forest. The shoreline of Bonaire is dotted with lagoons and inlets, the largest of which is Goto Lake in the north. These lagoons and wetlands provide an excellent habitat for a wide variety of shorebirds.

While Bonaire has some hills and variations in altitude, Klein Bonaire&#x27;s surface is quite level and just about two meters above sea level. Because Klein Bonaire is as yet undeveloped, the fringing reef system surrounding Klein Bonaire is pristine. 

=== Geology ===

Geologists believe that Bonaire and the other ABC islands were formed about 90 million years ago. As the Caribbean plate collided with the South American plate, it forced a large mass of rock to the ocean surface and created the Leeward Antilles Ridge. The islands of Bonaire, Aruba, and Curaçao were formed along this ridge. As such, Bonaire lies within the Caribbean–South America plate boundary zone. Some geologists place Bonaire&#x27;s location on the South American continental shelf; while others place the island&#x27;s location on or above the Caribbean plate.

The island is essentially coral that has been geologically pushed up and out of the sea. As the seabed rose upwards a vast coral reef grew on what is now dry land. These corals were eventually exposed to air and perished, becoming surface limestone deposits over the millennia. As a result, reef limestone covers a large part of the Bonarie today, as well as the natural fringing reef system, in which the coral formations start at the shoreline. Tidal variations are only about , so the corals start at the low tide line and continue on, following the underwater topography of the island&#x27;s base. Bonaire&#x27;s tides are more affected by a combination of wind and low/high-pressure systems than by the moon.

Due to its history, the geology of Bonaire is dominated by gently dipping carbonate rocks ranging in age from Cretaceous (≈90-100 million years ago (Ma)) to Miocene (≈5 Ma), which lie unconformably on a pre-Cretaceous igneous basement. Where the unconformity corresponds with sea-level erosion, caves are common. 

=== Climate ===
Bonaire has a warm, dry (though humid) and windy climate. The average temperature is with a seasonal variation and daily variation. The highest recorded temperature is and the lowest, . The ocean temperature around the island fluctuates between . Nearly constant winds blow from the east with an average speed of . The humidity is very constant, averaging 76% and fluctuating between 85% and 66% on a daily basis. This semi-arid climate is conducive to a variety of cacti and other desert plants.

Average annual rainfall is , most of which occurs in October through January. Bonaire lies outside the Main Development Region for Atlantic tropical cyclone activity, though the island is occasionally affected by hurricanes and tropical storms.

===Ecology===

Bonaire is fringed by a coral reef which is accessible to divers from the shore along the lee side of the island (facing west-southwest). The entire coastline of the island was designated a marine sanctuary in 1979, an effort to preserve and protect the delicate coral reef and the marine life that depends on it. There are more than 350 species of fish and sixty species of coral living in Bonaire&#x27;s reef. Boulder Star Coral (&quot;Montastraea annularis&quot;) is the most common coral, according to a 2011 survey. In 2011, biologists discovered a new species of jellyfish in Bonaire, the highly venomous Bonaire banded box jellyfish (&quot;Tamoya ohboya&quot;).

Bonaire is also famed for its flamingo populations and its donkey sanctuary. Flamingos are drawn to the brackish water of the island&#x27;s lagoons, which harbor the shrimp upon which they feed. Bonaire is home to one of only four nesting grounds for the Caribbean flamingo. Located in the Pekelmeer in the southern part of the island, no human entry is permitted in this sanctuary. In the 16th century, Europeans introduced sheep, goats, pigs, horses and donkeys on Bonaire, and the descendants of the donkeys, goats, and pigs roam the island today.

Bonaire is also home to the ecologically vulnerable yellow-shouldered amazon parrot, &quot;Amazona barbadensis&quot;.

===Environmental initiatives===
The island of Bonaire has long been a leader in nature conservation and ecological responsibility. Bonaire&#x27;s National Park Foundation (&quot;Stichting Nationale Parken&quot; or STINAPA), was founded in 1962 for the purpose of actively protecting nature on the island. In 1969 STINAPA succeeded in establishing both the flamingo nesting sanctuary and Washington National Park, the first such nature preserves in the Netherlands Antilles. In 1979, the Slagbaai plantation was added to the park, now known as Washington Slagbaai National Park (WSNP). The Bonaire National Marine Park (BNMP) was also established in 1979. The Marine Park consists of the whole coastline of Bonaire from the high-water mark down to a depth of and includes a large mangrove forest in Lac Bay. Lac Bay, Klein Bonaire, Pelkermeer, Slagbaai and Gotomeer are recognized as wetlands of international significance under the Ramsar Convention.

Due to a public-private sector partnership, programs are being developed to advance the local awareness and attitudes toward conservation and habitat preservation in order to proactively protect Bonaire&#x27;s ecosystem. A new sewage treatment plant will contribute to protecting the reefs and the seawater quality. In 2013 Selibon, the national garbage-processing plant, opened an the Plaza Medio Ambiente recycling center, where the general public can bring glass, cans, paper, scrap metal, cardboard, batteries, motor oil, cooking oil, electronics, mobile phones and textiles.

The island is environmentally aware and protective of its coral reefs, the diversity of its aquatic ecosystems, and the conservation of its many species and natural environments above and below the water. The island&#x27;s government, businesses and residents are committed to recycling waste products, and making others aware of the importance and benefits. Divers and dive shops take part in collecting debris washed ashore and preparing it for recycling.

Bonaire gets a significant amount of its electricity from an array of twelve wind generators along its northeastern coastline which began operating in 2010. This renewable source now fills 40–45% of the island&#x27;s electricity needs. Work continues in developing additional renewable sources of energy, including bio-diesel and solar, with the goal of becoming 100% reliant on renewables.

=== Washington Slagbaai National Park ===

Washington Slagbaai National Park is an ecological preserve on the northern tip of the island. The 6,000-hectare park was established in 1969 as the first nature park in the Netherlands Antilles. It is home to a wide variety of habitats, such as the bocas (inlets), dunes on the north coast, salt pans, pos (springs) and mountain areas. 

The park is rich in birds and other animals, especially lizards, including iguanas. Within the park there are two areas recognised internationally as important wetlands under the Ramsar Convention: the Slagbaai salt marsh and Lake Gotom. The park is also of great cultural-historical importance, not least because of the plantations and the history of Slagbaai. 

At the entrance to the park is the Bonaire Museum. From the entrance there are several signposted walks. The park is easily accessible by car and mountain bikers are also welcome. The highest point of Bonaire, Mount Brandaris, is tall and is located within this preserve. It has a complete view of the island.

=== Dos Pos ===

Adjacent to Washington Slagbaai National Park, Dos Pos is the former location of a planation. Dos Pos has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of several threatened or restricted-range bird species. The landscape is one of small hills and sheltered valleys with remnant fruit trees, mainly mangoes, and a small ephemeral pond. 

=== Washikemba–Fontein–Onima Important Bird Area ===

Located along the North-Eastern coast of the island, this 5,959 ha strip of land has also been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by Birdlife International because it supports populations of several threatened or restricted-range bird species. The landscape includes three freshwater reservoirs as well as scrubland and some introduced fruit trees.

=== Bonaire National Marine Park ===

The Bonaire National Marine Park (BNMP) is a legally protected underwater park surrounding the entire islands of Bonaire and Klein Bonaire. The park was established in 1979 with the support of the World Wide Fund for Nature and others, and is managed by STINAPA. There are more than 80 dive sites in the marine park.

=== Klein Bonaire ===

Klein Bonaire (Dutch for &quot;Little Bonaire&quot;) is an islet located off the western coast Bonaire, about a 0.5 mile from Kralendijk. The small island is 700 hectares (2.7 sq miles) in size. The island is accessible by boat for divers, snorkelers, and day-trippers. 

The island is completely flat and covered with bushes, cacti, and small trees. There are at least 76 species of plants and about 55 species of animals on the island. The island is an important location for bats, sea turtles, and flamingos. &quot;Leptonycteris curasoae&quot; rely on Klein Bonaire for sources of nectar. Sea turtles rely on Klein Bonaire&#x27;s beaches for nesting, especially those on the northeast side. Flamingos rely on Klein Bonaire&#x27;s salt pans, where they feed. (Bonaire has one of the largest flamingo populations in the world). 

The island is surrounded by fringing coral reefs. The reefs are home to more than 340 fish species, and almost every species of hard and soft coral found in the Caribbean. Its reefs and underwater wildlife make it a popular destination for divers, and it is surrounded by dive sites. 

In the late 20th century, with the growth of diving tourism on Bonaire, project developers wanted to build hotels on Klein Bonaire. In 1999 the island was bought and safeguarded by the Island Territory of Bonaire with the help of the Netherlands, the World Wide Fund for Nature and other conservationists. Klein Bonaire has been a legally protected nature reserve since 2001, when it was incorporated as part of the Bonaire National Marine Park. The island is also protected as a wetland of international importance by the Ramsar Convention.

=== Lac Bay ===
Lac Bay is a shallow lagoon in the southeast of Bonaire. The 700 hectare area is surrounded by mangroves. The bay is part of the protected underwater park and has been designated an aquatic area of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. The bay is unique for the presence of seagrasses and mangroves. Part of the mangroves is virtually undisturbed due to limited accessibility, making it important as a resting area for bird species. Lac Bay is an important resting and nesting area for many marine birds and invertebrates, including the queen conch or &quot;Karkó&quot;. This mollusk used to be found in large numbers here, but overfishing has largely eradicated the population. The area serves as a nursery for reef fish and is the feeding ground for the green sea turtle.

=== Pekelmeer ===
Pekel Lake and the flamingo reserve (800 hectares) are part of the large aquatic area in the south-west of the island. Salt is still extracted from this area. It is also the most important feeding and living area for the flamingo. Depending on the season, between 2,000 and 7,000 flamingos can be found in this area. The flamingo reserve is the most important breeding site in the Southern Caribbean. The total population migrating between Bonaire and South America is estimated at 20,000 individuals. The flamingo places special demands on its environment (water quality, tranquillity) and is very sensitive to disturbance. The Pekelmeer and the flamingo reserve have been designated as a water area of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. Bonaire will continue to actively protect the flamingo, the symbol of the island.

=== Salt pans ===

Bonaire also is known for its salt pans (also called salt lakes, salt flats, or &quot;saliñas&quot;),&quot;&quot; which cover 10% of the island&#x27;s land. Salt pans are salt lakes or inlets that are closed to the sea by a dead coral dyke. They have an important function because they ensure the collection and filtration of rainwater. This prevents nutrients and soil particles from reaching the reef and causing damage to the corals. This function is especially crucial during heavy rainfall. The salt pans are also an important feeding ground for many waterbirds. Slagbaai, Gotomeer, Pekelmeer and the Klein Bonaire salt pans are aquatic areas of international importance in the context of the Ramsar Convention. Economically, the salt flats provide for the production and exportation of salt.

=== Caves ===
Bonaire has many dozens of caves. There are estimated to be over 200 caves on the island, though not all are easily accessible. As a geological manifestation they give a picture of the oldest history of the island. In several there are cave drawings made by the original inhabitants of Bonaire. Some caves are home to bats or the blind shrimp &quot;Typhlatya&quot;. Bats play a useful role in the ecosystem: they trap a large number of insects (including mosquitoes) or provide pollination of flowers, including cactus flowers. The greatest threat to bats is the destruction or disturbance of their roosts.

==Government==
===Island Council===
The island council is the local, democratically elected parliament. It is the highest governing body in the public body and is responsible for local legislation. Executive power is held by the Crown-appointed governor and the island deputies appointed by the island council. The Three main political parties are the Bonaire People&#x27;s Movement led by Elvis Tjin Asjoe, the Bonaire Patriotic Union led by Esther Bernabela and the Bonaire Democratic Party led by Clark Abraham. Smaller parties include Movement 21 and Bonaire Social Party

===2010 referendum===
Prior to the 2010 referendum, the Netherlands Antilles (comprising the islands of Curaçao, Bonaire, St. Eustatius, St. Maarten and Saba) were governed as a parliamentary democracy based on the Dutch system of government with free elections held every four years. Dissension about their political future resulted in four of the five islands advocating for separation from the Netherlands Antilles. Some of the island residents wanted autonomy while others wanted more integration.

In 2005 a conference was held by the governments of the Netherlands, Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles to discuss future constitutional reform and the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles. In 2006, Sint Maarten and Curaçao chose autonomy, and Bonaire, St. Eustatius and Saba opted for a closer relationship with the Netherlands. Constitutional referendums and dismantlement of the Netherlands Antilles was scheduled to take place in 2010.

Bonaire&#x27;s announced referendum scheduled for 26 March 2010 was canceled in February 2010. The governor of the Dutch Antilles, Frits Goedgedrag, decided to cancel it because it probably contravened international law since part of the population was barred from voting. European Dutch nationals were only allowed to vote if they arrived on the island before 1 January 2007. The referendum was postponed to September and then October 2010. Eventually the referendum was held on 17 December 2010, with 84% voting in favor of becoming part of the Netherlands. However, as the 35% voter turnout rate was below the required 51%, the results of the referendum were declared invalid.

=== Judicial Institution and Prison ===
The Judicial Institution (JI) of the Dutch Caribbean (&quot;Justitiële Inrichting Caribisch Nederland&quot;), based on Bonaire, is located in Kralendijk. Since 10 October 2010, the centre has been under the responsibility of the Department of Judicial Institutions (DJI), the agency of the Dutch Ministry of Justice and Security for the execution of sentences and custodial measures. The Bonaire site is both a House of Detention and a Judicial Institution. Since 6 December 2010 there is capacity for 76 men, women and juveniles. The name in Papiamentu is Institushon Hudisial Karibe Hulandes, Boneiru site.

==Economy==

=== Tourism ===
Bonaire&#x27;s economy is mainly based on tourism, taking advantage of its warm, dry climate and natural environment. The island caters to scuba divers and snorkelers, as the surrounding coral reefs are well preserved and easily accessible from the shore. Bonaire has been widely recognized for many years in the diving community as one of the world&#x27;s best shore diving destinations.

Bonaire&#x27;s Marine Park offers a total of 86 named dive sites and is home to over 57 species of soft and stony coral and more than 350 recorded fish species. Most resorts and hotels have an on-site dive shop, and other accommodations are affiliated with a dive operation. The license plates carry the logo &quot;Diver&#x27;s Paradise&quot; (in English).

Lac Bay, in the southeastern part of the island, attracts wind surfers from around the world to Bonaire. The shallow Bay is on the windward side of the island, so trade winds are strong and constant. A barrier reef across the mouth of the bay allows windsurfers of all skill levels to select wave conditions they like. Lac Bay is one of the stops in the PWA Windsurfing Freestyle World Cup and has hosted the Prokids IFCA Championship. Five of the PWA&#x27;s ten highest ranked freestyle windsurfers are from Bonaire: Kiri Thode, Amado Vrieswijk, Bjorn Saragoza, Tonky Frans and Taty Frans. In the northern end of Lac Bay is one of the best preserved mangrove forests in the Caribbean, which is popular for kayaking and snorkelling.

Bonaire is also a port of call for more than fifteen cruise lines who make more than eighty calls per season at the island. The total passenger capacity for cruise ships in Bonaire is about 185,000.

Tourism infrastructure in Bonaire is contemporary and offers a variety of types of accommodations including hotels, full-service resorts, a few small bed and breakfasts and self-catering vacation rentals of all kinds. Other tourist activities include kite-boarding, windsurfing, mountain-biking, hiking, sailing, charter fishing, boating and bird-watching. All-in-all tourist expenditures in Bonaire are estimated at $125 million per year.

===Currency===

In 2011 the BES Islands replaced their currency, the Netherlands Antillean guilder (: ANG, symbol: ƒ), with the US dollar rather than replacing it with the euro which is used in the European Netherlands. The decision was based primarily on the needs for tourism and trade. Most countries and territories in the Caribbean use the dollar as their currency or have a currency linked to the dollar as legal tender. The guilder was pegged to the US dollar for decades with an exchange rate of ƒ1.79 = US$1.00. Adopting the dollar put an end to the dual-currency payment system and foreign exchange charges. The guilder remained in use in Curaçao and Sint Maarten.

===Taxes===

The separate tax regimes for Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba present a greater risk of double taxation or double exemption from taxes. In an effort to remove the risk, two plans were introduced. One plan prevents double taxation between the Netherlands (Europe) and the BES Islands while the other prevents double taxation between the BES Islands and third countries. The new regime will generate a total annual tax revenue estimated at $52 million which is equal to the current tax revenues on the three islands. The combined population of the three islands is about 20,000; about half of these pay income tax.

=== Salt production ===
Utilizing the naturally low-lying geography and traditional Dutch dike design, much of Bonaire&#x27;s southern half has been made into a giant system of ponds and pools which evaporate seawater to produce salt. Presently operated by Cargill, Bonaire&#x27;s solar salt works produces 400,000 tonnes of industrial grade salt per year. After collection, the salt is then washed and stored in pyramid-shaped piles roughly 15 metres in height, each containing approximately 10,000 tonnes of 99.6 percent pure salt. The salt facility operates its own pier where ships are loaded with salt destined for North American, European and Western Pacific markets. Bonaire&#x27;s salt is used primarily in industry.

The large condensing ponds which ring the crystallizer basins, called the Pekelmeer, are a natural habitat for numerous species of brine shrimp which in turn feed flocks of hundreds of pink flamingoes and other migratory birds. This is the location of Bonaire&#x27;s flamingo sanctuary.

=== Oil storage and shipment ===
The Bonaire Petroleum Corporation (BOPEC) is a fuel oil storage and transshipment terminal on Bonaire. BOPEC is wholly owned by Venezuelan oil company PDVSA, and functions primarily as a storage facility for multiple grades of refined and non-refined oils from Venezuela and refineries on Curaçao and Aruba. BOPEC also has mixing and blending capabilities for its stored fuels. BOPEC&#x27;s #1 pier can receive tankers up to 500,000DWT, which means there are only seven ships in the world that are too big for the BOPEC terminal. A fire at the BOPEC terminal in 2010 is believed to have had a significant impact on Goto Lake and at least one other nearby lagoon.

=== Plantations and plantation houses ===
In 1868 and 1870, a large part of the government land was auctioned and sold. These included five lots for forestry and livestock farming and nine lots for salt exploitation. The buyers of these large lots were mainly wealthy people from Curaçao, successful merchants, who had no intention of living on their plantations. There are no real plantations on Bonaire. The climate and soil conditions on Bonaire are not very favourable for the cultivation of fruits and vegetables of any size. Only salt extraction is economically attractive. In addition, on some &quot;plantations&quot; aloe cultivation (last exported in 1973), maize cultivation (due to drought there was not enough harvest every year), charcoal burning and cattle breeding (mainly goats, last exported in 1970) were carried out.

In the early 20th century, Bonaire&#x27;s middle class was also able to buy plantation land. On Curaçao, the land house served as the main house of a plantation, where the owner lived. In the immediate vicinity were outbuildings, barns, stables and corrals. Surrounding it were the slave dwellings. On Bonaire, the plantation houses became the owners&#x27; cottages, where they stayed during the weekends. Often during the week there was an overseer (vito) who supervised the work on the plantation.

==Transportation==

Bonaire&#x27;s first airport was located near Tra&#x27;i Montaña Subi Blanku and crossed the current path from Kralendijk to Rincon. It was built in 1936. The airport proved to be too small when American soldiers arrived on Bonaire in the second half of 1943. The commander stated that a new airport had to be built. Construction began in December 1943, with the new &quot;Flamingo Airport&quot; opening in 1945. A small terminal was built that was suitable for the number of passengers at the time. This building was used until mid-1976. The airport had received many extensions of both the runway and the terminal itself.

Today the airport is known as Flamingo International Airport and is served by a variety of both domestic and international airlines. Services from the US include Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines. Airlines providing European service include TUI Netherlands and KLM. Consistent air service from Curaçao is provided by Divi Divi Air and EZ Air.

The airport is equipped with a fire station, control tower and hangar. Plans are under way for modifications to the current airport facilities, the runway and the fire station.

==Settlements==

The two towns on the island are Kralendijk (the capital) and Rincon.
Kralendijk has many suburbs/neighbourhoods, although on an island with such a small population, the distinction is not always clearcut.

The town of Kralendijk is a result of a merger of six villages: Antriol (Entrejol), Nikiboko, Noord Saliña, Playa, Leeuwarden and Tera Kora. The town of Rincon is the only other town.

Labra, Ishiri, Kokorobi, Jan Doran, Vlijt, Rigot, Porto Spano and Kunchi were several smaller towns that had existed in the national park but were later abandoned.

== Demography ==
The population was estimated to be 24,090 in 2023, but has since risen to 25,133 by the start of 2024. 

The island&#x27;s population is diverse. Most of Bonaire&#x27;s inhabitants are of Mulatto descent (mixed European/African descent), with many of full African descent. A significant part of Bonaire&#x27;s population has origins from various countries, including the Netherlands, Dominican Republic, Colombia, Venezuela, Suriname, the United States, China, the former Netherlands Antilles etc.
=== Main population centres ===
The star on Bonaire&#x27;s flag has six points, representing the six original settlements. Due to population growth and building expansion, five of them have grown together with the capital Kralendijk (with over 22,000 inhabitants at the start of 2023, including the new districts). Only Rincon, the oldest settlement on the island, located in the northern half with some 1,900 inhabitants, remains an independent village. In addition to these nuclei, a number of new districts have been added over the years. Behind Kralendijk, against the hill, are the Republiek and Santa Barbara districts. Behind Santa Barbara, on the coast, is the luxurious new district of Sabadeco (Santa Barbara Development Corporation). Beyond the airport, in the direction of the salt flats, is the neighbourhood of Belnem, named after Harry Belafonte. The population as of 2017 is distributed in the old towns and districts as follows:

=== Religion ===

As in the rest of the former Netherlands Antilles, Christianity is the predominant religion of Bonaire. Roman Catholicism is the faith of the majority (68%) of the population, and there are also Protestant minorities. Catholicism was introduced during the period of Spanish rule. Although the island would pass under the control of the Protestant Netherlands, Catholicism remained the principal island religion. Ecclesiastically, the churches on Bonaire depend on the Catholic diocese of Willemstad on the neighboring island of Curaçao.

After the discovery of Bonaire by Alonso de Ojeda in 1499, the spiritual life of the Christians was in the hands of the monks who came from Venezuela for baptisms. These missionaries belonged to the Jesuits of the Franciscan order. The first resident priest was Jacob Bernardus Eisenbel (Dutch), who came from Aruba to settle for several years in Bonaire and after whom the Parish of St. Bernard, the main Catholic church of the capital of Bonaire, Kralendijk, is named.

Rincon, Bonaire&#x27;s second largest city, offers numerous regular festivals, including the annual Simadan (harvest) festivals and Dia di San Juan (St. John&#x27;s Day).

Bonaire also has an Islamic centre and a Jewish community.

===Education===

Bonaire&#x27;s educational system is patterned after the Dutch system. Early grades are taught solely in Papiamentu, with more and more Dutch being introduced as the grade level progresses.

Scholengemeenschap Bonaire serves as Bonaire&#x27;s secondary school, for ages 12–18.

===Languages===

As Bonaire is part of the Netherlands, Dutch is the official language, and the sole language for all administration and legal matters. However, as at 2017 it is the main language of only 15% of the population — around two thirds, or the majority of Bonaire&#x27;s population, use the creole language of Papiamentu as their main language.

In January 2024 the insular council of Bonaire passed a motion to declare Papiamento a regional language of Bonaire under the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands said that this decision would be implemented.

In the 2001 census, Dutch was the main language of only 8.8% of the population, in 2024 this tripled and is now around 25%. The most widely spoken language was Papiamentu, the primary language of 60% of the populace and is recognized by the government. Spanish was the main language of 11.8% of the people, English the primary language of 2.8%, and other languages accounted for 1.8%. Bonaire is a polyglot society, with most of Bonaire&#x27;s population able to converse in at least two of the languages of Papiamentu, Dutch, English and Spanish.

==Sports==
Bonaire residents participate in numerous sporting events, including all the popular sports that attract tourists to the island such as scuba diving, sailing, fishing, boating, windsurfing, kite surfing, biking, baseball, association football, volleyball and tennis. There are multiple dive shops on Bonaire, most of which offer scuba instruction and PADI, NAUI, SSI and CMAS certification. The island&#x27;s dive shops typically offer scuba tank and dive gear rental, boat diving excursions, snorkeling, kayaking, and naturalist classes. Some dive shops have gas blending stations, and offer tec diving instruction and excursions.

Bonaire hosted the PWA Bonaire World Cup 2014 and the 10th Prokids IFCA Championship 2014 at Lac Bay in Sorobon on the east side of the island. It is home to several professional windsurfing champions. The island is also home to the annual Bonaire Sailing Regatta, a national sailing competition and celebration that has been held every October in Playa. The event first began in 1967 when Captain Don Stewart challenged Hubert Domacasse to a race, wagering 27 cases of beer that his fishing boat &quot;Sislin&quot; was faster than Domacasse&#x27;s fishing boat &quot;Velia&quot;. The races are run between the leeward side of the island and Klein Bonaire.

The Bonaire Football Federation is a member of CONCACAF and the Bonaire Volleyball Federation is an associate member of CAZOVA (Caribbean Zonal Volleyball Association) and NORCECA. The Baseball teams play in the Caribbean region of Little league and Pony league. Bonaire was also confirmed as the 218th Table Tennis National association.

==Media==
===Radio===
Trans World Radio (TWR) first established its AM broadcasting site on the island of Bonaire in 1964 to broadcast Christian programs into Latin America and the Caribbean. The programs were broadcast in Spanish, Dutch and English. TWR-Bonaire began their operation with three transmitters, including a Brown-Boveri medium wave transmitter (500 kW over 800 kHz) and two shortwave transmitters (200 kW and 50 kW); however, their license to operate the 500 kW transmitter was revoked in 1999 thereby restricting broadcast to 100 kW. The Brown-Boveri medium wave transmitter was sold and removed from the island. It was replaced with another medium wave transmitter (PJB3-AM). In 2012, TWR-Bonaire was permitted to increase its power from 100 kW to 450 kW but in order to do so, they had to raise 38 million euros (US$43,456,610.00). In 2016 they commissioned Kintronic Labs to build a four-mast, parallel-array directional antenna system. On January 31, 2018, they acquired a 450 kW Nautel Broadcast medium wave transmitter for US$3.8 million, and the name changed from Trans World Radio to Shine 800 AM.

Radio Netherlands Worldwide operated a shortwave relay station at . Because of widespread availability of internet links providing higher audio quality and more flexibility, shortwave broadcasts by RNW-Bonaire were discontinued and at the end of October 2012, the radio station was closed and installations dismantled.

Bonaire has two island radio stations that broadcast general information: Bon FM and Radiodifucion Boneriano. The language spoken for both is Papiamentu.

===Internet and newspapers===
There are several internet news sources including &quot;BES Reporter&quot; in English, &quot;Bonaire&quot; in Papiamentu and Dutch, &quot;Bonaire Nieuws&quot; in Dutch, and &quot;Info Bonaire&quot; in English. The local newspapers, some of which are also available online, include &quot;The Bonaire Reporter&quot; in English, &quot;Extra and Boneriano&quot; in Papiamentu, &quot;Bonaire Times&quot; in English, Spanish and Dutch, and two Dutch newspapers: &quot;Amigoe&quot; and &quot;Antilliaans Dagblad&quot;.

===Television===

Flamingo Television Bonaire B.V. offers cable programming and internet access via cable connection or fiber optics. Local and regional programming is offered in different languages including Papiamentu, Spanish, Dutch and Chinese. English channels are made available through the efforts of a unified group of cable companies comprising the Caribbean Cable Cooperative Ltd.

Digital television programs and internet access are offered by Telbo N.V., a communication and media provider with an IP based infrastructure. They are the primary telephone service provider, and also offer various packages of high quality digital television programs with 130+ digital channels.

Residents of Bonaire receive some of Venezuela&#x27;s main national television channels, all primarily in Spanish.

== Symbols ==

=== Flag ===
The flag, with the six-pointed star, symbolises a compass. The people of Bonaire are skilled fishermen and sailors. It is also said that the four points of the ring indicating East, West, South and North are intended to indicate that all people in the world are equal, regardless of where they come from. The red colour refers to the blood and the survivability of the people of Bonaire. Yellow represents the sun, the beach and the flowers of the Kibrahachi and the cactus. White represents peace and internationalisation. Blue represents the sea. The flag has not existed for a long time. It was only on 11 December 1981 that the design was approved, to which the whole population was able to contribute and give its opinion.

<text>Windsor is a town in Hartford County, Connecticut, United States, and was the first English settlement in the state. It lies on the northern border of Connecticut&#x27;s capital, Hartford. The town is part of the Capitol Planning Region. The population of Windsor was 29,492 at the 2020 census.

Poquonock () is a northern area of Windsor that has its own zip code (06064) for post-office box purposes. Other unincorporated areas in Windsor include Rainbow and Hayden Station in the north, and Wilson and Deerfield in the south.

The Day Hill Road area is known as Windsor&#x27;s Corporate Area, although other centers of business include New England Tradeport, Kennedy Industry Park and Kennedy Business Park, all near Bradley International Airport and the Addison Road Industrial Park.

==History==

The coastal areas and riverways were traditional areas of settlement by various American Indian cultures, who had been in the region for thousands of years. They relied on the rivers for fishing, water and transportation. Before European contact, the historic Pequot and Mohegan tribes had been one Algonquian-speaking people. After they separated, they became competitors and traditional enemies in the Connecticut region.

During the first part of the 17th century, the Pequot and Mohegan nations had been at war. The Podunk were forced to pay tribute to the more powerful Pequot, who claimed their land. Eventually, the Podunk invited a small party of settlers from Plymouth, Massachusetts, to settle as a mediating force between the other tribes. In exchange they granted them a plot of land at the confluence of the Farmington River and the west side of the Connecticut River. After Edward Winslow came from Plymouth to inspect the land, William Holmes led a small party, arriving at the site on September 26, 1633, where they founded a trading post. The spot of the trading post is at the confluence of the Farmington and Connecticut Rivers. The Loomis Chaffee School currently owns the land as the spot is now the school&#x27;s sports fields.

Native Americans referred to the area as &quot;Matianuck&quot;. It was about up river from Long Island Sound, at the end of waters navigable by ship and above the Dutch fort at Hartford, offering an advantageous location for the English to trade with the Indians before they reached the Dutch. (The Sicaog tribe had made a similar offer to mediate to the Dutch in New Amsterdam. New Netherland had far fewer European settlers than New England, and they were not in a position to take up the opportunity.)

In 1635, a party of around 30 people, sponsored by Sir Richard Saltonstall, and led by the Stiles brothers, Francis, John and Henry, settled in the Windsor area. Governor John Winthrop of the Massachusetts Bay Company acknowledged in a letter to Saltonstall that the Stiles party was the second group to settle Connecticut.

The first group of 60 or more people were led by Roger Ludlow, primary framer of the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, having trekked overland from Dorchester, Massachusetts. They had arrived in the New World five years earlier on the ship &quot;Mary and John&quot; from Plymouth, England, and settled in Dorchester. Reverend Warham promptly renamed the Connecticut settlement &quot;Dorchester&quot;. During the next few years, more settlers arrived from Dorchester, outnumbering and soon displacing the original Plymouth contingent, who returned to Plymouth in 1638 after selling their parcel to a Matthew Allyn of Hartford.

On February 21, 1637, the colony&#x27;s General Court changed the name of the settlement from Dorchester to Windsor, named after the town of Windsor, Berkshire, on the River Thames in England. The same day, Windsor was incorporated as a town along with Hartford and Wethersfield.

Several &quot;daughter towns&quot; were formed from Windsor&#x27;s original boundaries. These include portions or all of Barkhamsted, Bloomfield, Bolton, Colebrook, Coventry, East Granby, East Windsor, Ellington, Enfield, Granby, Harwinton, Litchfield, Manchester, Morris, Simsbury, South Windsor, Suffield, Tolland, Torrington, Vernon, and Windsor Locks.

The first &quot;highway&quot; in the Connecticut Colony opened in 1638 between Windsor and Hartford. Two years later, the highway was extended north to the colony&#x27;s 1636 settlement at Springfield, with the road also connecting to Wethersfield and thus the four settlements that came to dominate the region for much of colonial history were connected.

In the summer of 1640, an event took place that would forever change the boundaries of the Connecticut River Valley. During a grain famine, the founder of Springfield, William Pynchon, was given authority by Windsor and Hartford to negotiate a price for grain for the three settlements with the natives. First, the natives refused to sell grain at the usual market price, and then refused to sell it at &quot;a reasonable price&quot;. Pynchon refused to buy it, attempting to teach the natives a peaceful lesson about integrity and reliability. Windsor&#x27;s cattle were starving, however, and the citizens of Hartford were furious. With Windsor&#x27;s consent, Hartford commissioned the famous Indian fighter John Mason to travel to Springfield with &quot;money in one hand and a sword in the other&quot; to threaten the natives, and thereby force the grain trade. The natives capitulated and ultimately sold their grain. After &quot;negotiating the trade&quot;, Mason refused to share the grain with Springfield, and, to add further insult, insisted that Springfield pay a tax when sailing ships passed Windsor. Outraged, Springfield forever sided with the Massachusetts Bay Colony, a Puritan settlement in Boston, rather than with the Connecticut Colony, which was much closer geographically and far more compatible ideologically. Windsor played a neutral role in the colonial rivalry between Hartford and Springfield; however, Windsor&#x27;s direct border with both settlements caused many discussions about whether to align with Massachusetts or Connecticut. Ultimately, Windsor sided with Connecticut.

The Hartford &amp; Springfield Street Railway, a trolley, connected with the Connecticut Company in Windsor Center until 1925. Buses replaced trolleys between Rainbow (a northern section of Windsor) and Windsor Center in 1930. Trolley cars continued to run from Windsor to Hartford until 1940.

The original Windsor settlers have many descendants around the country and beyond. Many are members of the Descendants of the Founders of Ancient Windsor (DFAW).

When the Springfield Line of the NY, New Haven &amp; Hartford RR was built, station stops included Windsor station in Windsor Center with stations also at Wilson in the south of town and Hayden in the north, named for owners who provided land for the railroad right of way. The line was double tracked until the late 1990s and redouble tracked in 2018. Sidings at Windsor station allowed cars to be spotted at the freight house and on the Loomis trestle just to its south. The trestle was removed in the late 1980s. An 1856 brownstone arch bridge carries the tracks over Pleasant St and the Farmington River. Incorporating a horizontal curve, its engineering was noteworthy when built. Following a fatal grade crossing accident, a three-track-wide plate girder bridge was installed to carry tracks over Palisado Avenue.
==Geography==

Windsor&#x27;s highest point is on Day Hill at above sea level. Windsor&#x27;s lowest point is on the Connecticut River, at above sea level.

 The Connecticut River defines Windsor&#x27;s eastern border. The city of Hartford, the capital of Connecticut, is adjacent to Windsor to the south. The town of Windsor Locks, home of Bradley International Airport, is adjacent to Windsor to the north. Prior to its incorporation in 1854, it was known as the Pine Meadow section of Windsor. The towns of East Windsor and South Windsor are on the east side of the Connecticut River. The town of Bloomfield is to the west. The town of East Granby is to the northwest.

The Farmington River joins the Connecticut River in Windsor. The Farmington River is dammed in the northwestern corner of Windsor to form the Rainbow Reservoir.

===Historical points of interest===
The Joseph Kesselring stage play and Frank Capra movie &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; was inspired by actual events that took place in a three-story brick house on Prospect Street, just off the north end of the Windsor green. Sixty men died between 1907 and 1917 while in the care of Amy Archer-Gilligan. Most were proven to be victims of arsenic poisoning.

On historic Palisado Avenue, one can find the First Church in Windsor, Congregational, and adjacent graveyard.

Across the street on the Palisado Green stands a statue of John Mason, a founder of Windsor and a colonial leader in the Pequot War. 

Further north is the home of Oliver Ellsworth, third Chief Justice of the United States.

The town center is well-planned in comparison to many others in the Greater Hartford area. It has a relative diversity of chains and local shops, as well as a restored Amtrak train station dating to the 1850s. The Vintage Radio and Communications Museum of Connecticut is located in Windsor.

From 1957 to 2006, the town was the location of the S1C Nuclear Powered Training Unit; a prototype nuclear power plant for the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program. The former site has the distinction of being the first nuclear reactor site to receive unrestricted release after demolition and decontamination efforts.

===Tobacco farming===

Tobacco farming in Connecticut has a long history. When the first settlers came to the valley in the 1630s, tobacco was already being grown by the native population. By 1700 it was being exported via the Connecticut River to European ports. The use of Connecticut tobacco as a cigar wrapper leaf began in the 1820s.

Area farmers grew tobacco for the two outside layers of cigars, the binder and the wrapper. Approximately of land in Connecticut is covered by Windsor Soil, named after the town.

The movie &quot;Parrish&quot;, starring Troy Donahue and Karl Malden, was set and filmed in the tobacco farms of Windsor. The film was released in 1961.

The Connecticut Valley Tobacco Museum, containing authentic farming implements and tools, can be found at Northwest Park in Windsor.

Within the Barkhamsted Reservoir lie the foundations of Barkhamsted Hollow, the historic center of town that was purchased by the Metropolitan District Commission of Connecticut in the early 20th century to create a reservoir to serve the Hartford area. This area was flooded following the construction of the Saville Dam on the East Branch of the Farmington River, and took eight years to fill.

Just south of the Barkhamsted Reservoir is Lake McDonough, also known as the compensating reservoir and owned by the MDC. Originally created to ensure the riparian rights of downstream mill owners, this lake now serves the recreational interests of the surrounding area with beaches, boating, and fishing.

The hamlet of Pleasant Valley contains the Pleasant Valley General Store, the Barkhamsted Elementary School, the Pleasant Valley Drive-In, the post office (ZIP Code 06063), and the town hall.

The hamlet of Riverton holds a post office (ZIP Code 06065), the Riverton General Store, the Riverton Inn, the Royal Coachman Tavern, the Riverton Congregational Church, the grange, and the fair grounds. This is also the location of the annual Riverton Fair, which takes place the second weekend of October each year, and is Connecticut&#x27;s last fair of the year.

The West Branch of the Farmington River is designated as a Wild and Scenic River. It runs through the villages of Riverton and Pleasant Valley and hosts fishermen year-round in the catch-and-release section. On the opening day of fishing season each year, a fishing tournament is held in Riverton, drawing anglers from Connecticut, New York, and Massachusetts.

<doc id="108744" wikidata="Q2443707" url="?curid=108744" title="Kedleston Hall">
<text>Kedleston Hall is a neo-classical manor house owned by the National Trust, and seat of the Curzon family, located in Kedleston, Derbyshire, approximately 4 miles (6 km) north-west of Derby. The medieval village of Kedleston was moved in 1759 by Nathaniel Curzon to make way for the manor. All that remains of the original village is the 12th century All Saints Church, Kedleston.

==Background==
The current house was commissioned in 1759 by Nathaniel Curzon and designed by Robert Adam.

The Curzon family, whose name originates in Notre-Dame-de-Courson in Normandy, have been in Kedleston since at least 1297, and have lived in a succession of manor houses near to or on the site of the present Kedleston Hall. The present house was commissioned by Sir Nathaniel Curzon (later 1st Baron Scarsdale) in 1759. The house was designed by the Palladian architects James Paine and Matthew Brettingham and was loosely based on an original plan by Andrea Palladio for the never-built Villa Mocenigo.

At the time a relatively unknown architect, Robert Adam, was designing some garden temples to enhance the landscape of the park; Curzon was so impressed with his designs that Adam was quickly put in charge of the construction of the new mansion.

On the death of Richard Curzon, 2nd Viscount Scarsdale in 1977, expenses compelled the heir, his cousin (Francis Curzon), to transfer the property to the care of the National Trust.

== Exterior ==

The design of the three-floored house is of three blocks linked by two segmentally curved corridors. The ground floor is rusticated, while the upper floors are of smooth-dressed stone. The central, corps de logis, the largest block, contains the state rooms and was intended only for formal entertaining. The East block was a self-contained country house in its own right, containing all the rooms for the family&#x27;s private use, and the identical West block contained the kitchens and all other domestic rooms and staff accommodation.

Plans for two more pavilions (as the two smaller blocks are known), of identical size and similar appearance, were never executed. These further wings were intended to contain, in the south-east a music room, and in the southwest a conservatory and chapel. Externally these latter pavilions would have differed from their northern counterparts by large glazed Serlian windows on the &quot;piano nobile&quot; of their southern facades. Here the blocks were to appear as of two floors only; a mezzanine was to have been disguised in the north of the music room block. The linking galleries here were also to contain larger windows, than on the north, and niches containing classical statuary.

The north front, approximately 117 yards [107 m] in length, is Palladian in character, dominated by a massive, six-columned Corinthian portico; however, the south front (&quot;illustrated right&quot;) is pure neoclassical Robert Adam. This garden facade is divided into three distinct sets of bays; the central section is a four-columned, blind triumphal arch (based on the Arch of Constantine in Rome) containing one large, pedimented glass door reached from the rusticated ground floor by an external, curved double staircase. Above the door, at second-floor height, are stone garlands and medallions in relief.

The four Corinthian columns are topped by classical statues. This whole centre section of the facade is crowned by a low dome visible only from a distance. Flanking the central section are two identical wings on three floors, each three windows wide, the windows of the first-floor &quot;piano nobile&quot; being the tallest. Adam&#x27;s design for this facade contains huge &quot;movement&quot; and has a delicate almost fragile quality.

== Interior ==

The neoclassical interior of the house was designed by Adam to be no less impressive than the exterior.

===Hall===

Entering the house through the great north portico on the &quot;piano nobile&quot;, one is confronted by the marble hall. Nikolaus Pevsner describes this as one of the most magnificent apartments of the 18th century in England. It measures by in plan and is high.

Twenty fluted pink Nottingham alabaster columns with Corinthian capitals support the heavily decorated, high-coved cornice. Niches in the walls contain casts of classical statuary by Matthew Brettingham the Younger and others; above the niches are grisaille panels of Homeric subjects inspired by Palladio&#x27;s illustration of the Temple of Mars. The stucco in the ceiling was created by Joseph Rose in the 1770s.

The floor is of inlaid Italian marble. Matthew Paine&#x27;s original designs for this room intended for it to be lit by conventional windows at the northern end, but Adam, warming to the Roman theme, did away with the distracting windows and lit the whole from the roof through innovative glass skylight.

The overmantels to the fireplaces are by Joseph Rose with firebaskets by Robert Adam.

At Kedleston, the hall symbolises the atrium of the Roman villa and the adjoining saloon the vestibulum.

===Saloon===

The saloon, contained behind the triumphal arch of the south front, like the marble hall rises the full height of the house, to the top of the dome, where it too is sky-lit through a glass oculus. Designed as a sculpture gallery, this circular room in width was completed in 1763.

The decorative theme is based on the temples of the Roman Forum with more modern inventions: in the four massive, apse-like recesses are stoves disguised as pedestals for classical urns. The paintings of ruins are by Gavin Hamilton and the grisaille panels have scenes of British worthies painted by John Biagio Rebecca.

The four sets of double doors giving entry to the room have heavy pediments supported by scagliola columns, and at second-floor height, grisaille panels depict classical themes.

From the saloon, the atmosphere of the 18th-century Grand Tour is continued throughout the remainder of the principal reception rooms of the &quot;piano nobile&quot;, though on a slightly more modest scale.

===State bedroom===
The &quot;principal apartment&quot;, or State bedroom suite, contains fine furniture and paintings.

The state bed was constructed by James Gravenor of Derby. The state bed posts are carved to represent palm tree trunks which soar up and break into flamboyant foliage at the top, sweeping in palm-fronds behind.

===Drawing room===

The drawing room with huge alabaster Venetian window is by by . The doorcase is also alabaster. The fireplace with a scene of virtue rewarded by honour and riches is flanked by large female figures sculpted by Michael Henry Spang. The gilt sofas by John Linnell date from around 1765. They were commissioned by the 1st Baron Scarsdale and supplied, together with a second pair of sofas to Kedleston in 1765.

===Dining room===

The dining room, with its gigantic apse, has a ceiling that Adam based on the Domus Augustana in the Farnese Gardens. The apse contains curved tables designed by Adam in 1762 and a giant wine cooler. The ceiling contains panel paintings of the continents by Antonio Zucchi, the seasons by Gavin Hamilton and the centre is by George Morland. The original wall panels are by Francesco Zuccarelli, Frans Snyders, Claude and Giovanni Francesco Romanelli.

===Music Room===
The Music Room has Ionic doorcases and delicate plaster ceiling designed by Adam. The marble chimneypiece is inlaid with Blue John. The pipe organ was second hand by John Snetzler with the case designed by Robert Adam and built by Robert Gravenor. A second manual with Hautboy was added in 1824 by Alexander Buckingham. The organ was restored in 1993 by Dominic Gwynn.

===Library===

The library contains a Roman doric doorcase leading to the Saloon. The bookcases were designed by Robert Adam and built by James Gravenor of Derby. The plaster ceiling is divided into octagonal patterns. The library desk was built in 1764 by James Gravenor.

===Other rooms===
The theme carries on through the music room, down the grand staircase (not completed until 1922) onto the ground floor and into the so-called &quot;Caesar&#x27;s hall&quot;. On the departure of guests, it must sometimes have been a relief to vacate this temple of culture and retreat to the relatively simple comforts of the family pavilion.

Below the Rotunda is the Tetrastyle Hall, which was converted into a museum in 1927 in collaboration with the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The kitchen is an oblong shape with a balustraded gallery at one end. This links the room to other household offices on each side.

Also displayed in the house are many curiosities pertaining to George, Lord Curzon of Kedleston, who succeeded to the house in 1916 and who had earlier served as Viceroy of India from 1899 to 1905. Lord Curzon had amassed a large collection of subcontinental and Far Eastern artefacts. Also shown is Lady Curzon&#x27;s Delhi Durbar Coronation dress of 1903. Designed by Worth of Paris, it was known as the peacock dress for the many precious and semi-precious stones sewn into its fabric. These have now been replaced by imitation stones; however, the effect is no less dazzling.

In addition to that described above, the house contains collections of art, furniture and statuary, hence Kedleston Hall&#x27;s alternative name, &quot;The Temple of the Arts&quot;.

== Gardens and grounds ==


The gardens and grounds, as they appear today, are largely the concept of Robert Adam. Adam was asked by Nathaniel Curzon in 1758 to &quot;take in hand the deer park and pleasure grounds&quot;. The landscape gardener William Emes had begun work at Kedleston in 1756, and he continued in Curzon&#x27;s employ until 1760; however, it was Adam who was the guiding influence. It was during this period that the former gardens designed by Charles Bridgeman were swept away in favour of a more natural-looking landscape. Bridgeman&#x27;s canals and geometric ponds were metamorphosed into serpentine lakes.
Adam designed numerous temples and follies, many of which were never built. Those that were include the North lodge (which takes the form of a triumphal arch), the entrance lodges in the village, a bridge, cascade and the Fishing Room. The Fishing Room is one of the most noticeable of the park&#x27;s buildings. In the neoclassical style it is sited on the edge of the upper lake and contains a plunge pool and boat house below. Some of Adam&#x27;s unexecuted design for follies in the park rivalled in grandeur the house itself.

A &quot;View Tower&quot; designed in 1760 – high and wide on five floors, surmounted by a saucer dome flanked by the smaller domes of flanking towers — would have been a small neoclassical palace itself. Adam planned to transform even mundane utilitarian buildings into architectural wonders. A design for a pheasant house (a platform to provide a vantage point for the game shooting) became a domed temple, the roofs of its classical porticos providing the necessary platforms; this plan too was never completed. Among the statuary in the grounds is a Medici lion sculpture carved by Joseph Wilton on a pedestal designed by Samuel Wyatt, from around 1760–1770.

In the 1770s, George Richardson designed the hexagonal summerhouse, and in 1800 the orangery. The Long Walk was laid out in 1760 and planted with flowering shrubs and ornamental trees. In 1763, it was reported that Lord Scarsdale had given his gardener a seed from rare and scarce Italian shrub, the &quot;Rodo Dendrone&quot; (&quot;sic&quot;).

The gardens and grounds today, over two hundred years later, remain mostly unaltered. Parts of the park are designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, primarily because of the &quot;rich and diverse deadwood invertebrate fauna&quot; inhabiting its ancient trees.

==Later history==

=== Second World War ===
In 1939, Kedleston Hall was offered by Richard Curzon, 2nd Viscount Scarsdale, for use by the War Office. The Hall was used in various ways during the War, including as a mustering point and army training camp.

It also formed one of the Y-stations used to gather signals intelligence by collecting radio transmissions which, if encrypted, were subsequently passed to Bletchley Park for decryption.

===Post war===
In 1957 Viscount Scarsdale launched a programme of restoration on the exterior of the building which was estimated to cost £30,000 (). Lord Scarsdale contributed £10,000 and the state provided the rest.

In 1973-74 the central block roof was re-slated and exterior stonework was cleaned by Stone and Marble Maintenance Ltd of Willington Road, Etwall. This revealed the pinkish tinge in the sandy coloured stone.

===National Trust===
By the 1970s Kedleston Hall had become too expensive for the Curzon family to maintain. When Richard Curzon, 2nd Viscount Scarsdale, died, his cousin Francis Curzon, 3rd Viscount Scarsdale, offered the house, park and gardens to the nation in lieu of death duties. A deal was agreed with the National Trust that it should take over Kedleston, along with an endowment, while still allowing the family to live rent-free in the 23-room Family Wing, which contained an adjoining garden and two rent-free flats for servants or other family members. Richard Curzon and his family currently reside there.

The National Trust engaged Edward Wood and Sons in 1987-88 for a £1,000,000 () programme of restoration. The West Pavilion was given a new roof and a new central heating system was installed. The grand staircase was strengthened with reinforcing bars to stop the cantilevered stairs from sagging.

Government House was built on the lines of Kedleston Hall. By coincidence a prominent member of the House of Curzon, George, Lord Curzon of Kedleston, became Viceroy of India in 1899 and was consequently resident of both houses.

The travel writer E. V. Lucas later commented that &quot;It is easier in Calcutta to be suddenly transported to England than in any other Indian city that I visited. There are, it is true, more statues of Lord Curzon than we are accustomed to [in England]; but many of the homes are quite English, save for the multitude of servants; Government House, serene and spacious and patrician, is a replica of Kedlestone Hall in Derbyshire.&quot;

<text>Bridgewater is a town in Litchfield County, Connecticut, United States. The population was 1,662 at the 2020 census, a decline from the figure of 1,727 tabulated in 2010. The town is part of the Western Connecticut Planning Region.

Bridgewater is well known as being a weekend getaway for wealthy New Yorkers, due to its scenic wooded areas, location on the banks of Lake Lillinonah and proximity to New York City. Bridgewater was one of the last remaining dry towns (Eastford is still a dry town) in Connecticut until voters approved the sale of alcohol in a 2014 referendum, by a 660–246 vote. The Bridgewater Country Fair is a popular annual event held every August, attracting visitors from all over New England and the Tri-state area.

===The Burnham Library===

In 1904, the Bridgewater Library Association was established, succeeding previous lending libraries operated by individuals in town. In 1909 room for library purposes was set aside in recently built town hall. A bequest from William Dixon Burnham, a native who made his fortune in shipping, allowed a Greek Revival style building to be erected from 1925 to 1926, using Mine Hill granite from nearby Roxbury. The dedication took place on August 26, 1926.

By the early 1960s, the library&#x27;s two floors were finally becoming cramped. With the death of town resident Van Wyck Brooks, a biographer and critic, a &quot;Van Wyck Brooks Memorial Fund was set up to raise money for a library wing in his name. The effort, however, flopped, despite support from such celebrities as Pearl Buck and Archibald MacLeish. Just enough money was raised for a bust of the author and a display of some of his memorabilia. His desk, books, and other items can be found on display in the library&#x27;s biography section. The fund-raising committee disbanded in 1972, but a year later, a surprising source of funding became known.

Charles E. Piggott, a hermit, misanthrope, and miser living in a Los Angeles slum, died in 1973. As a bulldozer operator razed the shack that had been Piggott&#x27;s home, the operator happened to notice something shiny. It was a bottle with Piggott&#x27;s holographic will inside.

Despite apparently having no discernible connection with Bridgewater, Piggott left the fund $300,000—money from careful investments over the years. The state of California contested the will and the library hired a lawyer, at considerable cost, to defend the bequest. Eventually, the lawyer won the case and the library got $210,000.

By 1980, the Van Wyck Brooks Memorial Wing was dedicated, doubling the size of the library.

Burton Bernstein, a longtime town resident, looked into why Piggott would leave money to the library, then wrote an article on the bequest, which appeared in the December 18, 1978, issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Piggott, as it turned out, had been a voracious reader on any number of subjects and loved public libraries (which are, after all, free). Bernstein believes that Piggott came across Van Wyck Brooks&#x27; &quot;The Flowering of New England&quot;, which describes the hermit Henry David Thoreau. Piggott may have compared himself to Thoreau, or saw wisdom in some of Thoreau&#x27;s ideas as presented by Brooks. Perhaps this quote stuck in his mind: &quot;The mass of men led lives of quiet desperation... Did they not know that the wisest had always lived, with respect to comforts and luxuries, a life more simple and meager than the poor?... Poverty had given him all this wealth.&quot;

Piggott heard of the Van Wyck Brooks Memorial Fund, recognized the name, and, Bernstein believes, decided to contribute.
