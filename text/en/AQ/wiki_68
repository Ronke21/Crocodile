<text>Plainfield is a village in Will and Kendall counties, Illinois, United States. The population was 44,762 at the 2020 census.

The village includes land in Will County&#x27;s Plainfield and Wheatland townships, as well as Na-Au-Say and Oswego townships in Kendall County. With the growth in the Chicago suburbs in the 1990s and 2000s, the village has seen a population increase, from 4,500 in 1990 to 28,000 in 2000 to nearly 45,000 in 2016. It is between the cities of Naperville and Joliet.

The village has established a community Preservation Commission and historic preservation ordinance. It is the home of the Lake Renwick Preserve, a county forest preserve used for birdwatching and other activities. Located south of Village Hall is Settlers&#x27; Park, which includes a lake, war monument, open space, and more. The park presents outdoor concerts to the public in the summer.

==History==

The area was called &quot;Walkers&#x27; Grove&quot; until it was platted as &quot;Plainfield&quot; in 1841. It was originally settled by a large community of Potawatomi people, and the land was later bequeathed to the United States as part of the Treaty of St. Louis (1816) with the Council of the Three Fires. Indian Boundary Road aligns with the western border of the tract of land originally ceded.

The earliest Europeans in the area were French fur traders. The first European-American settler in the area was James Walker, who with his father-in-law, Methodist minister Jessie Walker, traveled here in 1826 where he established a small mission for the Potawatomi people. James Walker, Jesse Walker&#x27;s son-in-law, traveled with him and became the first European-American to claim land in the area in 1828.

In 1828, James Walker, in the company of several men, erected a sawmill around which the settlement of Walkers&#x27; Grove developed.

Plainfield is identified as the oldest community in Will County because the earliest settlement of Walkers&#x27; Grove was established on the banks of the DuPage River by 1828. However, the actual village of Plainfield was platted immediately north of Walkers&#x27; Grove in 1834 by Chester Ingersoll. The separate community of East Plainfield was platted in June 1836 by James Mathers, who began selling lots in July 1836. He also constructed a gristmill and a mill race west of Water Street, which would later become Plainfield-Naperville Road. Ingersoll&#x27;s &quot;Planefield&quot; (Plainfield) which comprised lots in Section 16, along with Mather&#x27;s East Plainfield lots in Section 10 and Levi Arnold&#x27;s plat of Section 9, all became joined to create the present-day village after the death of Levi Arnolds in 1845.

Walkers&#x27; Grove flourished because of the DuPage River and established routes to Fort Dearborn in Chicago, as well as to Ottawa to the west. Reuben Flagg hauled lumber from Walker&#x27;s mill to Chicago in order to erect the first two frame structures in the city (the P.F.W. Peck House and the George Dole Forwarding House). Chicago also depended upon the settlement for mail and supplies.

The community&#x27;s early prosperity was stunted when the Illinois and Michigan Canal opened in 1848, because the village was not located along the canal. Located within the village are numerous Greek Revival, Upright and Wing cottages, a school built in 1847, and a number of early-19th-century homes. Plainfield currently has three buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Plainfield Halfway House, Flanders House, and a 1928 Standard Oil gas station.

Plainfield abolitionists offered food and shelter to runaway slaves following the Underground Railroad.

North Central College was founded in the village in 1861 as Plainfield College.

The Plainfield Public Library District was founded in the village in 1925 as the Nimmons Village of Plainfield Free Public Library.

Plainfield is the birthplace of Eddie Gardner, one of the pilots credited with establishing the transcontinental air mail routes for the United States Postal Service. The earliest architects associated with buildings in Plainfield are J.E. Minott of Aurora; G. Julian Barnes &amp; John H. Barnes of Joliet; and Herbert Cowell of Joliet and Plainfield.

Certain older parts of Plainfield once suffered from extreme traffic congestion. Before Interstate 55 was built just east of the village in the late 1950s, U.S. Route 30 (the Lincoln Highway) and U.S. Route 66 (sometimes referred to as &quot;The Mother Road&quot;) merged into one street for three blocks in the center of town on what is now Illinois Route 59. The merge was between Plainfield/Joliet Road on the south to Lockport Street on the north, but continues to be an area of heavy traffic congestion even outside heavy commuting periods. At one time, the two longest paved highways in the world (Lincoln Highway and U.S. Route 66) crossed within Plainfield. The highways only crossed each other twice and both locations are in Will County. The other location is in neighboring Joliet.

=== 1990 Tornado ===
On August 28, 1990, an F5 tornado ran its course through Plainfield. The &quot;Plainfield Tornado&quot; killed 29 people, 24 of whom were killed instantly, and 350 were injured. More than 1,100 homes were damaged and destroyed. The tornado made it across more than in only 8 minutes. It destroyed the only Plainfield high school at the time, now called Plainfield Central High School. A population boom started to take place at the end of the 20th century after the tornado, with a large number of new home subdivisions. Before this, Plainfield was primarily an agricultural town.

==Geography==
Plainfield is located in northwestern Will County. The village limits extend west into the eastern part of Kendall County. Plainfield is bordered to the north by the city of Naperville, to the northeast by the village of Bolingbrook, to the east by the village of Romeoville, and to the south by the city of Joliet. Farmland in Kendall County is to the west.

Interstate 55 runs along the eastern edge of the village, with access from two exits. I-55 leads northeast to the center of Chicago and southwest to Bloomington. U.S. Route 30 passes through the center of Plainfield, leading northwest to Montgomery and southeast to Joliet. Illinois Route 126 crosses US-30 in the center of Plainfield, leading northeast to I-55 and west to Yorkville. Illinois Route 59 runs through the center of Plainfield with US-30 but leads north to the west side of Naperville and south to Shorewood.

According to the 2010 census, Plainfield has a total area of , of which (or 95.95%) is land and (or 4.05%) is water. The DuPage River flows through the village center, running south towards the Des Plaines River in the Illinois River watershed.

Like its namesake, Plainfield&#x27;s topography is generally flat. Thousands of years ago, land in greater Plainfield used to be part of the bed of proglacial Lake Wauponsee. However, the lake did not hold up long, and eventually drained into the Illinois River valley. The lake left behind a very flat landscape. Much of downtown Plainfield has an elevation of around above sea level, with some areas in the western and northwestern portions of the village&#x27;s outskirts exceeding . This rise in elevation was created by terminal moraines that were formed during the Wisconsin Episode of the last ice age&#x27;s last glacial period that has been recorded.

== Architecture of Plainfield, IL ==

=== Downtown (Lockport St.) ===

In the mid 1800s, the business district of Plainfield consisted of wood-framed buildings of all shapes and sizes, yet between 1-2 stories high, and commonly had projecting awnings of wood and metal, along with either false fronted, horizontal wood cornices or large display windows. There were wood plank sidewalks that were elevated 2ft above the dirt roads on a limestone foundation. The last wood-framed building constructed on Lockport St. was in 1869, and the first masonry buildings constructed along Lockport St. were in 1865, and the post 1870 masonry buildings introduced a new commercial look where common design themes began to integrate the buildings together; including: identical floor and roof lines, cast iron storefronts with larger windows, operable canvas awnings, stamped metal cornices, etc..

=== Early Churches ===
The early church buildings of Plainfield were wood-framed and imposed Greek Revival and Gothic Revival edifices along the dirt roads. In the 1850&#x27;s, four different congregations built churches along Lockport street, including the Methodists, Congregationalists, the Baptists, and the Evangelicals.

In 1836 the Methodists built a wood-framed church (located on present-day Lockport street), and in 1868 they built another church much larger and of limestone (located on present-day Illinois street in downtown Plainfield). The original church built in 1836 was later converted into a business on the first floor and a social hall on the second floor.

In 1850 the Congregational Church (located at present-day Lockport and Illinois streets) was built and cost $2,200. The east wing of the church was added in 1907.

In 1836 the Baptist church erected their first church, sized at 26ft by 36ft, and cost of $2,500. This church was later turned into a blacksmith shop in 1857 following the construction of a new church that costed $4,500-$5,000, and burned down in 1914, then rebuilt on the same site again (located at present-day Division and Lockport streets).

==History==
Romeoville was one of the last areas of Will County occupied by Native Americans. The village of Romeo was first settled on September 14, 1835, on Isle a La Cache, a small island in the Des Plaines River. Around this time, the first bridge was built to allow access to the island from the west bank of the river. In 1848, the I&amp;M Canal was finished, drawing new residents to the area. On January 19, 1895, residents of Romeo voted to incorporate and changed the village&#x27;s name to Romeoville. The community, along with nearby Joliet, became known as &quot;Stone City&quot; in reference to its prosperous limestone quarries. The Illinois State Capitol in Springfield was unveiled in 1888, and is constructed entirely of Romeoville limestone. Lewis University was established on the outskirts of town in 1934.

Romeoville was one of fastest-growing communities in Illinois throughout the 1990s and 2000s. The population grew rapidly, and the village experienced an influx of over 25,000 new residents in two decades.

On September 16–17, 2023, a family of four, consisting of two adults and two children, were killed in a mass shooting at their home in Romeoville; their three dogs were also killed.

== History ==

In the early 19th century, Lusk&#x27;s Ferry Road was an important road that connected Fort Kaskaskia with Lusk&#x27;s Ferry on the Ohio River. The original survey maps of Illinois show a short segment of this road south of Creal Springs, in Johnson County. This old road most likely ran from Marion through Creal Springs before ascending to the summit of the Shawnee Hills. The modern road running toward the southeast into Creal Springs may be the old road. The road leading south out of Creal Springs toward Lake of Egypt links into the Wagon Creek Road, which leads to the segment mapped in the original survey. Modern maps also show traces of an older road that ran south out of Creal Springs along a less direct line.

The route south out of Creal Springs lead to a difficult passage over the Shawnee Summit. There was an easier, though longer, zigzag route east to New Burnside, southwest along modern U.S. Highway 45, and then back east to Reynoldsburg. Creal Springs may at one time have served as the junction of these alternative routes.

From 1884 to 1916, Creal Springs was the home of the Creal Springs Seminary, later the Creal Springs College and Conservatory of Music, which provided education at the preparatory, baccalaureate and master&#x27;s levels.

<text>Herrin is a city in Williamson County, Illinois. The population was 12,352 at the 2020 census.
The city is part of the Marion-Herrin Micropolitan Area and is a part of the Carbondale-Marion-Herrin, Illinois Combined Statistical Area with 123,272 residents, the sixth most populous Combined statistical area in Illinois.

==History==

The settlement of Herrin started out as scattered settlers on Herring&#x27;s Prairie named for the first permanent settler Isaac Herring, a Baptist preacher. Later, his son-in-law David Herrin arrived and the similarity in names led to the eventual shortening of the name to just Herrin&#x27;s Prairie. The trails from Jordan&#x27;s fort to Humphreys&#x27; ford on the Big Muddy River intersected the old trail from Lusk&#x27;s ferry at modern-day Golconda to Kaskaskia, which was first settled by French colonists.

Isaac Herring entered the first land in what became Herrin on 4 November 1816, two years before Illinois became a state. He paid $2 an acre for the . At the time he lived to the west in Jackson County, the land entry was the northeast quarter off Section 30, Township 8 South, Range 2 East of the Third Principal Meridian. Today that area runs between 17th and 27th streets, and from West Cherry Street on the north to West Stotlar Street on the south.

David Ruffin Harrison started storekeeping on the prairie in 1858. During the Civil War, he built a frame store building and secured a fourth class post office that opened on May 26, 1864. After coal was discovered and mining began in nearby Carterville, Harrison, and his cousins Ephraim Snyder Herrin and Mrs. Williams in 1892 prospected for coal beginning at the southwest corner of Williams&#x27; farm, identified in 1939 as the corner of Legion Boulevard and East Herrin Street. (Legion Boulevard no longer appears on the maps, but the reference indicates the intersection was the North and North East public roads. The 1908 county atlas shows North East Public Road two blocks east of Park Avenue which would make it North 13th Street). &quot;The men put up the cash, Mrs. Williams boarded the workers. A fine vein of coal was found at 185 feet.&quot;

In 1895, the Chicago and Carbondale Railroad organized to lay tracks between the Illinois Central Railroad at Carbondale and connect with the new Chicago, Paducah and Memphis Railroad that had opened up in 1894, going through the central part of the county. (This one later became the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad). Herrin convinced the developers to take their line between Carbondale and Johnston City through Herrin. Soon after it opened, the line was sold to the Chicago and Texas Railroad in the fall of 1895.

The following spring on May 8, 1896, the post office changed to Herrin post office. Cousins Harrison and Herrin, great-grandsons of Isaac Herring, made plans for a new town. They platted a 40-acre site divided by the line between Sections 19 and 30 of the township. They filed the plat 4 December 1896. The community incorporated as a village on March 21, 1898, and as a city two years later on April 17, 1900.

Herrin was the site of the 1922 Herrin massacre, resulting in the deaths of 23 miners and guards.

When mining made the town prosperous, Herrin had a recreational park known as White City Park. It opened on Memorial Day 1924 with 5000 in attendance. It had a salt water swimming pool, rides, and a theater. Touring big bands played here. The Dorsey Brothers and Frank Sinatra played bocce ball and performed there.

President Harry S. Truman came to Herrin in September 1948. Three future presidents came to Herrin during campaigns: Richard Nixon, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. Gerald Ford came to the Herrin-Marion airport in the 1970s.

At one time Herrin had 10 hotels, many clothing stores, grocery stores as well as department stores. Of the grocery stores Herrin has had over the years, not including national chains, Louie&#x27;s P&amp;R is the only local store to remain open.

In the beginning of the 21st century, Herrin by coincidence experienced two total eclipses of the sun in just seven years - the first on August 21st, 2017, and the second on April 8th, 2024.

<text>Johnston City is a city in Williamson County, Illinois, United States. The population was 3,348 at the 2020 census. This was a center of coal mining in the early 20th century, having a peak of population in the 1920s. The mining jobs attracted many immigrants from Europe.

==History==

Johnston City was founded in 1894 as a stop along the Chicago, Paducah and Memphis Railroad (later part of the Chicago and Eastern Illinois), and named for the contracting firm that constructed the railroad.

The eastern part of the city was originally known as Jeffersonville. It was surveyed in 1853. During the American Civil War it was a prosperous village. The post office was established in 1852 under the name Lake Creek. It was moved to Johnston City in 1903 but it was not until several years after that that Jeffersonville was fully amalgamated into Johnston City.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a number of immigrant miners from Italy, Wales and other areas arrived to work in the coal mines. There were tensions among the different ethnic groups, especially when miners went out on strike for better wages and conditions.

On June 10, 1915, the city was the site of the lynching of Joe Strando, an Italian immigrant miner from Sicily, by a mob of 300 American men. He was taken from the jail where he was held as a suspect in the murder of Edward Chapman, a wealthy local citizen, and wounding of his daughter. Sicilians were outraged and gathered reinforcements; Americans were arrayed against them. The governor sent in three companies of militia to suppress violence. Six years later, immigrant Settino de Santis confessed to the murder of Chapman, saying that the man was accidentally shot while visiting at the home of mine foreman Ben Schull. De Santis and two other men shot at Schull in retaliation for having been fired. De Santis confessed before he was executed in another capital case.

With the decline of mining, the number of jobs fell. By 1940 the city&#x27;s population was just under 4,000. For 2015 the US Census estimated the population at 3500.

In the 1960s a decline in coal miners occurred due to safety standards in the coal mines.

<text>The city of Marion is the county seat of Williamson County, Illinois, United States. The population in Marion, IL was 16,855 according to the 2020 census. 

It is part of a dispersed urban area that developed out of early 20th-century coal fields.

Today Marion serves as the largest retail trade center in Southern Illinois with its central location along Interstate 57 and Illinois Route 13.

The city is part of the Marion-Herrin Micropolitan Area and is a part of the Carbondale-Marion-Herrin, Illinois Combined Statistical Area with 123,272 residents, the sixth most populous Combined statistical area in Illinois.

== History ==

Following the creation of Williamson County out of the south half of Franklin County by the Illinois General Assembly, three commissioners appointed by the lawmakers met at Bainbridge, Illinois, on August 19, 1839, for the purpose of locating a new county seat as close to the center of the county as possible. The next day, August 20, they laid out a town of with a public square about one-quarter of a mile east of the county&#x27;s center, but a point on top of a slight hill of above sea level. The site sat in a small open grassland known as Poor Prairie. For a name, they chose Marion to honor American Revolutionary War hero Gen. Francis &quot;Swamp Fox&quot; Marion.

William and Bethany Benson had entered the quarter-quarter section of land that contained the future site of Marion just the previous year on September 8, 1838. He had lived in the county at least since 1817, and was the first settler to enter land in Poor Prairie. At the time the commissioners platted Marion, he had a small crop of corn and wheat growing over what became the public square.

The Williamson County Court organized in Marion on October 7, 1839, at the Benson log cabin. Overflow crowds had to use pumpkins for stools. The federal government established a post office at Marion on January 30, 1840, and the legislature incorporated the community as a city on February 24, 1841.

== Arts and culture ==
Downtown Marion is home to the Little Egypt Arts Gallery operated by the Little Egypt Arts Association as well as the Williamson County Historical Society museum and the Marion Carnegie Library. The major arts and culture institution though is the Marion Cultural and Civic Center.

=== Marion Cultural and Civic Center ===
In 2004, the Marion Civic Center was awarded the Frank Lloyd Wright Award - Special Recognition from the American Institute of Architects, Illinois Chapter, at the organization&#x27;s annual ceremony. The facility, designed by White and Borgognoni Architects, was completed in June 2004. After a 1997 fire destroyed the city&#x27;s former civic center, the new facility was crafted using parts of the old Orpheum Theater building.

The grand opening of the Orpheum Theatre was on January 2, 1922. Built in the southwest corner of the downtown square, she was the flagship of a chain of vaudeville and moving picture theaters constructed to tap into the wealth generated by agriculture and mining in Southern Illinois. The Orpheum Theatre sat over 900, and was ornately decorated in a mix of Renaissance and Neoclassical styles, complete with gold leaf, elaborate plasterwork, and a multicolored terra-cotta facade.

The Orpheum was quite successful until the advent of television. Decreasing profits forced the Orpheum to exclusively be a motion picture theater in the mid-1950s and to close in 1971. The City of Marion purchased the building in 1973 with the intent of constructing a parking lot. The mayor and the city council reconsidered their plan when they found that their citizenry was in favor of restoring the old theater for use by the community as a cultural and entertainment center.

During the early morning hours, of March 10, 1997, a blaze quickly raced through the Civic Center, and totally gutted the theater, leaving it a smoldering shell after the blaze was put out. The facade of the Orpheum was salvaged, but the remainder of the theater was razed, and in 2000, it was decided that a new Cultural and Civic Center would be built on the site of the old Orpheum and a couple of other demolished neighboring structures.
===Sister city===
Marion became a sister city to Kanie, Japan, on March 26, 2010.

==Tourism==
Tourism promotion and marketing in Marion is conducted at the county level with a county bed tax of five percent. Forty percent of that amount goes to the Williamson County Tourism Bureau and the remaining 60 percent to the Williamson County Events Commission for debt service on the bonds used to build the Williamson County Pavilion, a multi-use meeting and convention center immediately north of the Illinois Centre Mall in Marion. That building also houses the tourism bureau.

Camping facilities in the city include the new Marion Campground &amp; RV Park, located off of Exit 53 on the east side of the interstate.

Major attractions that draw visitors to Marion include events at Marion Stadium (Mt Dew Park), events at Southern Illinois University-Carbondale, The Southern Illinois Roller Girls bouts at The Pavilion Events, approximately two dozen wineries within a radius of the city including those on the Shawnee Hills Wine Trail and the Southern Illinois Wine Trail, Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge adjacent to the city, Lake of Egypt immediately to the south and the Shawnee National Forest and various state parks that stretch along the Shawnee Hills from river to river.

== Government ==
Marion&#x27;s city government is led by Mayor Mike Absher who assumed office on April 22, 2019, after defeating Incumbent Anthony Rinella who was appointed after longtime mayor Robert L. Butler resigned. The city operates on a city commission system of government with the mayor and four city commissioners, each elected for four-year terms.

The council calendar calls for meetings on the 2nd and 4th Mondays of the month at City Hall.

The city is also a home rule community, a status that gives the council greater flexibility to act than a typical city commission form of government.

The Marion Park District is independent of city government. It operates the parks system under a separately elected five-member board. The library board though is appointed by the mayor and city council.

<doc id="112082" wikidata="Q1255728" url="?curid=112082" title="Macintosh Plus">
<text>The Macintosh Plus computer is the third model in the Macintosh line, introduced on January 16, 1986, two years after the original Macintosh and a little more than a year after the Macintosh 512K, with a price tag of US$2,599. As an evolutionary improvement over the 512K, it shipped with 1 MB of RAM standard, expandable to 4 MB, and an external SCSI peripheral bus, among smaller improvements. Originally, the computer&#x27;s case was the same beige color as the original Macintosh, Pantone 453; however, in 1987, the case color was changed to the long-lived, warm gray &quot;Platinum&quot; color. It is the earliest Macintosh model able to run System Software 5, System 6, and System 7, up to System 7.5.5, but not System 7.5.2.

== Overview ==
Bruce Webster of &quot;BYTE&quot; reported a rumor in December 1985: &quot;Supposedly, Apple will be releasing a Big Mac by the time this column sees print: said Mac will reportedly come with 1 megabyte of RAM ... the new 128K-byte ROM ... and a double-sided (800K bytes) disk drive, all in the standard Mac box.&quot; Introduced as the Macintosh Plus, it was the first Macintosh model to include a SCSI port, which launched the popularity of external SCSI devices for Macs, including hard disks, tape drives, CD-ROM drives, printers, Zip drives, and even monitors. The SCSI implementation of the Plus was engineered shortly before the initial SCSI spec was finalized and, as such, is not 100% SCSI-compliant. SCSI ports remained standard equipment for all Macs until the introduction of the iMac in 1998.

The Macintosh Plus was the last classic Mac to have an RJ11 port on the front of the unit for the keyboard, as well as the DE-9 connector for the mouse; models released after the Macintosh Plus would use ADB ports.

The Mac Plus was the first Apple computer to utilize user-upgradable SIMM memory modules instead of single DIP DRAM chips. Four SIMM slots were provided and the computer shipped with four 256 KB SIMMs, for 1 MB total RAM. By replacing them with 1 MB SIMMs, it was possible to have 4 MB of RAM. (Although 30-pin SIMMs could support up to 16 MB total RAM, the Mac Plus motherboard had only 22 address lines connected, for a 4 MB maximum.)

It has what was then a new -inch double-sided 800 KB floppy drive, offering double the capacity of floppy disks from previous Macs, along with backward compatibility. The drive is controlled by the same IWM chip as in previous models, implementing variable speed GCR. The drive was still completely incompatible with PC drives. The 800 KB drive has two read/write heads, enabling it to simultaneously use both sides of the floppy disk and thereby double storage capacity. Like the 400 KB drive before it, a companion Macintosh 800K External Drive was an available option. However, with the increased disk storage capacity combined with 2-4x the available RAM, the external drive was less of a necessity than it had been with the 128K and 512K.

The Mac Plus has 128 KB of ROM on the motherboard, which is double the amount of ROM in previous Macs; the ROMs included software to support SCSI, the then-new 800 KB floppy drive, and the Hierarchical File System (HFS), which uses a true directory structure on disks (as opposed to the earlier MFS, Macintosh File System in which all files were stored in a single directory, with one level of pseudo-folders overlaid on them). For programmers, the fourth &quot;Inside Macintosh&quot; volume details how to use HFS and the rest of the Mac Plus&#x27;s new system software. The Plus still did not include provision for an internal hard drive and it would be over nine months before Apple would offer a SCSI drive replacement for the slow Hard Disk 20. It would be well over a year before Apple would offer the first internal hard disk drive in any Macintosh.

A compact Mac, the Plus has a 512 × 342 pixel monochrome display with a resolution of 72 PPI, identical to that of previous Macintosh models. Unlike earlier Macs, the Mac Plus&#x27;s keyboard includes a numeric keypad and directional arrow keys and, as with previous Macs, it has a one-button mouse and no fan, making it extremely quiet in operation. The lack of a cooling fan in the Mac Plus led to frequent problems with overheating and hardware malfunctions.

The applications MacPaint and MacWrite were bundled with the Mac Plus. After August 1987, HyperCard and MultiFinder were also bundled. Third-party software applications available included MacDraw, Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, as well as Aldus PageMaker. Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint (originally by Forethought) were actually developed and released first for the Macintosh, and similarly Microsoft Word 1 for Macintosh was the first time a GUI version of that software was introduced on any personal computer platform. For a time, the exclusive availability of Excel and PageMaker on the Macintosh were noticeable drivers of sales for the platform.

The case design is essentially identical to the original Macintosh. It debuted in beige and was labeled &quot;Macintosh Plus&quot; on the front, but &quot;Macintosh Plus 1 Mb&quot; on the back, to denote the 1 MB RAM configuration with which it shipped. In January 1987 it transitioned to Apple&#x27;s long-lived platinum-gray color with the rest of the Apple product line, and the keyboard&#x27;s keycaps changed from brown to gray. In January 1988, with reduced RAM prices, Apple began shipping 2- and 4- MB configurations and rebranded it simply as &quot;&quot;Macintosh Plus&quot;.&quot; Among other design changes, it included the same trademarked inlaid Apple logo and recessed port icons as the Apple IIc and IIGS before it, but it essentially retained the original design. On the inside of the case, embossed into it, are the signatures of all the people who worked on designing the Mac Plus, including Steve Jobs, Bill Atkinson, Andy Hertzfeld, Bruce Horn, Jef Raskin and the rest of the historic team.
An upgrade kit was offered for the earlier Macintosh 128K and Macintosh 512K/&quot;enhanced&quot;, which includes a new motherboard, floppy disk drive and rear case. The owner retained the front case, monitor and analog board. Because of this, there is no &quot;Macintosh Plus&quot; on the front of upgraded units, and the Apple logo is recessed and in the bottom left hand corner of the front case. However, the label on the back of the case reads &quot;Macintosh Plus 1MB&quot;. The new extended Plus keyboard could also be purchased. Unfortunately, this upgrade cost almost as much as a new machine.

The Mac Plus itself can be upgraded further with the use of third-party accelerators. When these are clipped or soldered onto the 68000 processor, a 32 MHz 68030 processor can be used, and up to 16 MB RAM.

==Long production life==

Although the Macintosh Plus would become overshadowed by two new Macintoshes, the Macintosh SE and the Macintosh II in March 1987, it remained in production as a cheaper alternative until the introduction of the Macintosh Classic on October 15, 1990. This made the Macintosh Plus the longest-produced Macintosh model, having been on sale unchanged for 1,734 days, a record not surpassed until the second-generation Mac Pro in 2018. It continued to be supported by versions of the classic Mac OS up to version 7.5.5, released in 1996. Additionally, during its period of general market relevance, it was heavily discounted like the 512K/512K&quot;e&quot; before it and offered to the educational market badged as the &quot;Macintosh Plus ED&quot;. Due to its popularity, long life and its introduction of many features that would become mainstays of the Macintosh platform for years, the Plus was a common &quot;base model&quot; for many software and hardware products.

==Problems==
The lack of fan could cause the life of a Macintosh Plus to end early for some users. As the power supply would heat up, solder joints inside it would fracture, causing many problems, such as loss of deflection in the monitor or a complete loss of power. As in most early compact Macs, the problem was common in the yoke connector, flyback transformer, and horizontal drive coupling capacitor. A fan was also often added to reduce heat when the machine was upgraded to its full RAM capacity of 4 MB.

From the debut of the Macintosh 128K through the Macintosh Plus, various third-party cooling add-ons were available to help increase airflow through the unit. Apple reorganized the compact Macintosh case to accommodate a fan with the release of the Macintosh SE, which optionally included a heat-generating internal hard disk.

===ROM revisions===
The Plus went through two ROM revisions during its general market relevance. The initial ROM was replaced after the first two months as it had a serious bug which prevented the Mac from booting if an external SCSI device was powered off. The second revision fixed a problem with some SCSI devices that could send the Mac into an endless reset at POST.

The average household size was 2.62 and the average family size was 3.10.

In the village, the population was spread out, with 25.5% under the age of 18, 14.5% from 18 to 24, 29.5% from 25 to 44, 20.0% from 45 to 64, and 10.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 30 years. For every 100 females, there were 98.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 102.5 males.

The median income for a household in the village was $33,125, and the median income for a family was $47,917. Males had a median income of $30,625 versus $21,250 for females. The per capita income for the village was $18,674. About 6.3% of families and 6.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including none of those under the age of eighteen and 20.9% of those 65 or over.

<text>Whiteash is a Census designated place in Williamson County, Illinois, United States. The population was 268 at the 2000 census, and dropped to 248 in the 2010 census. This village dissolved in 2014.

== History ==
Whiteash began as a coal mining community around the Chicago and Marion Coal Company&#x27;s mine organized by Charles A. Gent of nearby Marion, Illinois. In 1903, Gent bought the site of the village from Samuel K. Casey, publisher of the &quot;Egyptian Press&quot; newspaper also of Marion. He in turn had inherited it from his grandfather George W. Binkley who had homesteaded the land and entered it with the government in 1837. Gent platted the village on July 3, 1903, in the northwest corner of Section 31, Township 8 South, Range 3 East of the Third Principal Meridian, also known as Lake Creek Precinct. He named the town Whiteash after the trade name he used for the coal his mine produced.

A post office opened there on February 29, 1904, with Robert T. Payne as postmaster. Residents incorporated the village the following year on June 16, 1905. The mine operated until 1922 when it filled with water and was abandoned. Mail service continued for another decade or so, finally closing on November 30, 1934. The population in 1960 was 160.

<text>Cherry Valley is a village of that lies primarily in Winnebago County. Approximately ten percent of the village is within Boone County. The village is within the Rockford, Illinois Metropolitan Statistical Area, and borders the southeast side of Rockford. It is also within the Kishwaukee River valley. The population is 2,905 at the 2020 census, down from 3,162 as of the 2010 census.

==History==
Official documents from the Winnebago County Clerk&#x27;s office and the Village of Cherry Valley state Cherry Valley was settled in 1836. The first settler within Cherry Valley was Joseph Griggs who, along with his family, settled on the north bank of the Kishwaukee River in 1835. Cherry Valley was incorporated as a village on January 31, 1857. Early landmark events for Cherry Valley was the establishment of a mill on the Kishwaukee River, and the coming of the railroad in 1852.

Early on Cherry Valley was called by various names, such as &quot;Griggs Ford&quot; and &quot;Graball&quot;, and then other names, before the present name was adopted. After deciding to change the name, the people put their suggestions into a hat. A Mrs. Butler, from Cherry Valley, New York placed the name of Cherry Valley in the hat and that name was selected. The core of the village, centered on its main street businesses in small brick buildings, is surrounded by several blocks of houses built in the 19th century. This late 19th-century appearance is further accentuated by turn-of-the-20th-century-style lamp lights as well as the original brick paving along the eastern end of main street.

===Relationship with Rockford===
Although close to Rockford, Cherry Valley was far enough away to be considered, for most of its history, not a part of the Rockford community. However, with the advent of car-centric transportation in the latter 20th century, Cherry Valley became in essence a suburb of Rockford. As the city of Rockford grew and expanded its boundaries, it came in direct contact with Cherry Valley. Since that time, there have been land control-related issues between the two municipalities. For the most part, these issues have been resolved with a boundary agreement between the two communities.

===Cherry Valley today===
In the last dozen years Cherry Valley has seen a shift towards Chicago, with roughly a third of its new residents being former Chicago suburban residents who live in the village and commute to work in the Chicago suburbs. Being near to an interchange on I-90 (Jane Addams Memorial Tollway) contributed to this shift, and in 2006 the toll booths on the Cherry Valley interchange and exit were removed because of increased traffic flow and the need to remove the chronic traffic jams that had built over the years.

Most of Cherry Valley is within the Rockford School District, with a small portion in the Belvidere School District. Schools closed and demolished in 2019

==Geography==

==History==

Its township&#x27;s beginnings initiated originally in a no longer existing settlement called Elton, an area South of Durand and including parts of the Pecatonica and Rock Run townships and settled in 1835 by Nelson Salisbury, Harvey Lower, and Scott Robb. They and nine other families settled the Southwest portion of modern Durand, Pecatonica, and Rock Run area. Durand gave birth to Illinois&#x27; first tax-supported volunteer fire department. Since its settlement, Durand has been prone to devastating fires. Durand&#x27;s early flourishings were closely linked to the development of the Racine-Mississippi Railroad later absorbed into Western Union. The line reached Durand in 1857, en route to Freeport, paving the shift from the Elton community into modern Durand and deriving its name from the railroad&#x27;s first president, H.S. Durand.

== History ==

The name Machesney Park has its roots in Machesney Airport, which was located on the main street North Second where the Machesney Mall stands today, which was founded in 1927 by Fred Machesney, a Barnstorming aviator. The Machesney Elementary School across the street from where the airport was located was also named after Fred Machesney&#x27;s airport. The airfield was Rockford&#x27;s main airport until the 1950s, when the Greater Rockford Airport came on line. In 1928 a famous flight from Rockford to Sweden took off from the field. The attempt failed as the two pilots crashed in Greenland, later being safely rescued. Machesney Field was used by the Army Air Corps during World War II as a stop by fighter aircraft being ferried to the Soviet Union.

This area of unincorporated Winnebago county saw growth pick up after World War II. This led to the formation of North Park, a public water district and volunteer firefighting company, and the unofficial name for the area.

Machesney Park became a village in 1981, after being approved in a referendum.

== Education ==

The Village is home of Harlem High School, which is part of the Harlem School District 122. The Harlem District serves the communities of Loves Park, Machesney Park, and southern Roscoe.

<text>Pecatonica is a village in Winnebago County, Illinois, United States. It is part of the Rockford, Illinois Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 2,195 at the 2010 census, up from 1,997 in 2000.

== History ==

The village was named after the Pecatonica River, which forms its northern border. The word &quot;Pecatonica&quot; is an anglicization of two Algonquian language words; &quot;Bekaa&quot; (or &quot;Pekaa&quot; in certain dialects), which means &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;niba&quot;, which means &quot;water&quot;; forming the conjunction &quot;Bekaaniba&quot; or &quot;Slow Water&quot;. Civil War records from the state of Illinois include soldiers from &quot;Lysander&quot;, the area&#x27;s common name before incorporation by rail speculators.

The Galena and Chicago Union Railroad, later the Chicago &amp; North Western Railroad, came through in 1853 from Chicago and continued to Freeport, Illinois. That sparked the town to be the center of commerce for western Winnebago County. The Village of Pecatonica was incorporated in 1869, built on territory rightfully owned by Indians and previously deeded to the Reed family by US President James K. Polk. C.W. Knowlton opened his first bank here in 1882 and built a Queen Anne Victorian house on Main Street, on the hill overlooking the business district. This house still stands, after having been restored starting in the mid-1980s.

An electric interurban line known as the Rockford &amp; Interurban ran from Rockford through Winnebago, Illinois and Pecatonica to Ridott, Illinois and on to Freeport, starting in 1902, until the line&#x27;s eventual abandonment in 1930. A small depot building remains standing near the 300 block of Main Street. For the portion of the rail line between Pecatonica and Winnebago, the line often parallels the Pecatonica River.

This route has since been reclaimed as a nature trail known as the Prairie Path, called in 2021 the Pecatonica Prairie Trail, for walking and biking (non-motorized), with maps shown online. The village of Winnebago has also published a brochure of the trail which can be viewed online.

Prior to rail traffic, this region of Northern Illinois received stagecoach traffic. A limestone house on Comly Road dates to this period, and there are permanent wagon wheel scars near a utility building for the 12 Mile Grove Cemetery, which is just hundreds of feet from the current corridor used by U.S. Route 20, a major east–west route through Northern Illinois. Further west, Route 20 parallels more roads which sometime bear the phrase &quot;Stagecoach Trail&quot;.

==Geography==

Pecatonica is located at (42.309955, −89.358647).

According to the 2010 census, Pecatonica has a total area of , of which (or 98.84%) is land and (or 1.16%) is water.

==Education==
Education in Pecatonica is provided by the Pecatonica Community Unit School District #321, which operates three school buildings. The Elementary School, originally constructed in 1938, was used as a high school for many years. Two additions to that structure were built in 1962 and 1970 respectively. The Middle School, also a former high school building, was built in 1958 and also accommodated two additions to the original structure in 1967 and 1970.

The current high school building opened in 2003. This state-of-the-art facility is approximately 107,000 square feet. Along with the new high school building a football field and eight lane track were constructed. The high school complex also includes a baseball diamond and play field space for physical education classes. The building was built as a flexible multi-purpose facility that will allow for both school-based and community-based activities.

==Parks and recreation==

North of downtown Pecatonica, on West 1st Street is Sumner Park, which has three baseball diamonds, four tennis courts, two basketball courts, horseshoe pits and children&#x27;s playgrounds. The park connects with the recently acquired Pecatonica Wetlands Forest Preserve, both to the west and across the river to the north. Pecatonica Wetlands is made up of 1048 acres of flood plain forest, oxbow pond marshes and upland forest along the Pecatonica River. The site features spring flora and birdlife. Site development is still in progress but when complete will include fishing access, hiking and equestrian trails, picnic areas and wildlife areas.

The Seward Bluffs Forest Preserve is also located nearby. The combined Public Parks and the Recreation Bike and Prairie Path offer a wide variety of recreation. It is a favored fishing spot along the Pecatonica River.

==Winnebago County Fair Grounds==
The fairgrounds have over 108 acres of indoor and outdoor activities including music festivals, motor sports, auto and trade shows, conventions, antique markets, social events, and the Winnebago County Fair.

<text>Rockford is a city in Winnebago and Ogle counties, Illinois, United States. Located in far northern Illinois on the banks of the Rock River, Rockford is the seat of Winnebago County. The population was 148,655 at the 2020 census, making Rockford the fifth-most populous city in Illinois as well as the most populous outside the Chicago metropolitan area. It anchors the Rockford metropolitan area, which had 338,798 residents in 2020.

Settled in the mid-1830s as Midway due to its location roughly equidistant between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River, Rockford became strategic for industrial development. During the second half of the 19th century, it became notable for its production of heavy machinery, hardware, and tools. At the beginning of the 20th century, the city was the second leading center of furniture manufacturing in the U.S. During the second half of the 20th century, Rockford struggled alongside many Rust Belt cities to maintain its previous industrial presence. Since the late 1990s, efforts in economic diversification have led to the growth of automotive, aerospace, and healthcare industries, as well as the undertaking of various tourism and downtown revitalization efforts.

Nicknamed &quot;the Forest City&quot; for its heavily forested residential neighborhoods during the 20th century, Rockford is known for various venues of cultural or historical significance, including Anderson Japanese Gardens, Klehm Arboretum, Tinker Swiss Cottage, the BMO Harris Bank Center, the Coronado Theatre, the Laurent House, and the Burpee Museum of Natural History. Its contributions to music are noted in the Mendelssohn Club, the oldest music club in the U.S., and performers such as Cheap Trick and Phantom Regiment Drum and Bugle Corps.

==History==

===Settlement and development===

Rockford traces its roots to 1834, as the combined settlements of Midway were founded on both banks of the Rock River. On the west bank, Germanicus Kent and Thatcher Blake (with his slave Lewis Lemon) founded Kentville; the east bank was settled by Daniel Shaw Haight. With the location of the Rock River equidistant between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River, the combined settlement derived the name &quot;Midway&quot;. In 1836, Winnebago County was created (from both Jo Daviess and LaSalle counties), with Midway named as its county seat, as it was &quot;halfway between Galena and Chicago on a line of four-horse coaches.&quot;

In 1837, the village of Midway was renamed Rockford, highlighting a rocky river ford across the Rock River in the village. In the same year, Rockford established its first post office, with Daniel Shaw Haight as the first postmaster. In 1840, the first weekly newspaper began circulation. In 1847, Rockford Female Seminary – today Rockford University – was founded. On January 3, 1852, Rockford was officially chartered as a city; a year later the long-running &quot;Forest City&quot; nickname first appeared, used by the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;. Also in 1852, the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad connected Rockford to Chicago by railroad.

At the time of its founding, many of the village&#x27;s residents were transplants from the Northeastern United States and upstate New York. Descended from English Puritans, the Midway/Rockford population was similar to much of the rest of northern Illinois and nearly all of Wisconsin during the mid-19th century. After the Black Hawk War, additional immigrants moved to northern Illinois; during the 1830s and 1840s, Rockford and Winnebago County were considered a cultural extension of New England.

During the antebellum period, Rockford shared abolitionist leanings, lending considerable support to the Free Soil Party and the later Republican Party. In 1848, 42 percent of voters in Winnebago County (where Rockford dominated as the county seat) voted for Martin Van Buren. In 1852, Free Soil candidate John P. Hale became the first presidential candidate to visit Rockford, although he would only receive 28 percent of the vote. In 1860, Abraham Lincoln won 3,985 votes in Winnebago County to the 817 votes of Stephen A. Douglas.

The 1850s brought industry that would change Rockford forever. In 1853, inventor John Henry Manny moved to Rockford to produce horse-drawn mechanical reapers for farmers and transport the finished products by rail. Chicago implement manufacturer Cyrus McCormick (whose company became International Harvester) took Manny to court after he produced nearly 6,000 machines; Manny would prevail on both judgement and an appeal. Along with the production of agricultural machines, Swedish furniture cooperatives established the city as a manufacturing base. The Rockford Union Furniture Company, under John Erlander, spearheaded these cooperatives. Today, Erlander&#x27;s home is a Rockford museum that shows his efforts in elevating Rockford to second in furniture manufacturing in the United States, behind Grand Rapids.

During the Civil War, one of the first Illinois regiments to be mobilized, the Zouaves, were from Rockford. The city also served as the site for Camp Fuller, a training site for four other infantry regiments.

In 1884, Rockford established its first city-wide public school district, constructing Rockford Central High School in 1885; following the construction of the high school, the district began construction of brick multi-story multigrade school buildings across the city.

The Rockford Female Seminary became the alma mater of Jane Addams in 1881. The move accompanied the Seminary&#x27;s transition into a more complete curriculum, which was represented by its renaming to Rockford College in 1892. Culture flourished with the founding of the Mendelssohn Club in 1884, which became the oldest operating music club in the United States. It was complemented by the construction of a Carnegie library in 1902, which became the first building of Rockford&#x27;s public library system. 1903 saw the dedication of the Winnebago County Veterans Memorial Hall in the presence of sitting President Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt returned to Rockford during his campaign in 1912 and again to address the soldiers at Camp Grant, a training site for World War I soldiers.

===20th century===
The twentieth century saw demographic changes to Rockford. An influx of Italians, Poles, Lithuanians, and African Americans replaced the previously dominant Irish and Swedes. The city was also no stranger to contemporary political issues. Electorally divided between wets and drys on the subject of prohibition, Rockford featured a coalition of labor unionists and socialists that elected numerous aldermen and carried 25 to 40 percent in mayoral elections. During World War I, an antiwar protest by the Industrial Workers of the World led to 118 arrests. In 1920, the city was a target of the Palmer Raids. While its congressional district favored Republicans, Rockford continuously elected former socialists as mayor between 1921 and 1955.

One of its contemporary attractions, the Coronado Theatre, opened in 1927. Noted for its atmospheric styling, the Coronado rivaled its counterparts in Chicago and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Camp Grant was turned over to the Illinois National Guard. During World War II, it reopened as an induction center and POW detention camp. The USS &quot;Rockford&quot;, a Tacoma-class frigate named for the city, was commissioned in March 1944 and earned two service stars.

In the September 1949 issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine, postwar Rockford was described as &quot;nearly typical of the U.S. as any city can be.&quot; Due to this archetypal nature, sociologists like W. Lloyd Warner warned of the necessity to &quot;understand the realities of their system.&quot; In the late 1950s, Rockford lost over 50,000 trees to Dutch elm disease, thinning the tree canopy of the &quot;Forest City&quot; for decades.

From 1955 to 1965, several events would take place that would shape the development of Rockford into the 21st century. In 1956, construction was approved for a four-lane US 20 bypass; along with shifting truck traffic away from the downtown routing of the highway, the bypass established much of the southern border of the city (which remains to this day). In 1958, Interstate 90 was completed in Illinois, becoming the Northwest Tollway; in a decision that would change Rockford forever, the interstate highway was not routed through the city, but near the Winnebago-Boone county line, with the eastern terminus of the US 20 bypass in Cherry Valley.

In 1963, the Rockford area was selected by Chrysler Corporation to construct an assembly plant; the final site of what is now the Belvidere Assembly Plant is southwest of Belvidere, between US 20 and Interstate 90. While not located directly in the city, the Chrysler assembly plant has served as one of the largest employers of the region since its 1965 opening.

The growth of Rockford led to many changes to its educational systems. In 1955, Rockford College – now Rockford University – became co-educational for the first time. Coinciding with the expansion of the student body, the college outgrew its near-east side campus in use since the 1840s. After the acquisition of land in 1957, construction began on its present-day campus location, opening in 1964. In 1964, Rock Valley College was founded as a two-year community college, with construction on its campus commencing in 1965.

Prior to the 1960s, neighborhood and economic growth in Rockford largely mirrored itself on both sides of the Rock River. As the 20th century progressed, growth in western Rockford (and established neighborhoods in eastern areas of the city) struggled to compete with economic development that moved further east. From the late 1950s, downtown Rockford (centered around the intersection of IL 2 and US 20; Main Street and West State Street) began to decline as the primary shopping district of the city. In 1956, North Towne Mall opened on the far northwest side of the city, with Colonial Village opening on the (then) far east side in 1962, both of which were partially enclosed (some stores had exterior entrances). In 1973, Cherryvale Mall was opened as the first fully enclosed shopping mall in the city; nearly 6 miles from the city center, the mall was located at the intersection of the US-20 bypass and the Northwest Tollway, sharing a city border with Cherry Valley.

While growth at the eastern end of Rockford undersaw favorable conditions for growth, established neighborhoods began to suffer irrevocable decline. In the 1970s, efforts commenced to revitalize downtown Rockford, once the primary shopping district. In a highly criticized decision, the city reconfigured several blocks of downtown into a pedestrian mall, closing off the Main Street/West State Street intersection to traffic. In 1975, what the local press characterized as one of the most well-known and haunting crimes took place when newspaper delivery boy Joey Didier was kidnapped and murdered by Robert Lower. In the late 1970s, &quot;Symbol&quot;, a 47-foot tall Alexander Liberman abstract sculpture was placed in the center of the pedestrian mall. In 1980, then Congressman John B. Anderson, representing the 16th Congressional District in Illinois which includes Rockford, ran for President of the United States. Further attracting commercial growth, the MetroCentre 10,000-seat multi-purpose arena, was opened in 1981.

Rockford was hit hard by the early 1980s recession and became one of the highest-unemployed cities in the United States. In 1981, rail service to the city ended as Amtrak ended the Dubuque-to-Chicago Black Hawk route. After struggling to compete with more modern facilities, the Coronado Theatre showed its last movie in 1984, shifting solely to stage performances. To expand passenger service, the Greater Rockford Airport rebuilt its passenger terminal in 1987, although the access of Rockford to the Northwest Tollway (to the much larger O&#x27;Hare Airport) became a popular alternative.

In a decision that continues to affect Rockford to the present day, in 1989, Rockford Public School District 205 closed several schools across the city in a cost-cutting decision. In the aftermath of the decision, the school district was found guilty in federal court of discrimination against minority students. From 1993 to 2001, the school district was under federal oversight to desegregate its schools, costing over $250 million.

===21st century===
During the 2000s, a movement began to reverse urban blight of downtown Rockford, which had begun in the 1960s. After an 18-month multi-million dollar renovation and expansion, the Coronado Theatre was reopened in 2001. In 2008, the MetroCentre downtown arena completed a $20 million renovation (renamed the BMO Harris Bank Center in 2011). In 2009, the downtown pedestrian mall was removed as part of a street refurbishment project, restoring Main Street (Illinois Route 2) to two-lane traffic for the first time in nearly 45 years.

Prior to the onset of the Great Recession, housing in Rockford was affected by catastrophic weather events. In 2006 and 2007, Keith Creek underwent 100-year flooding events, damaging hundreds of older homes on the near east side of the city. In response, the city secured FEMA grants, demolishing over 100 homes; to reduce the severity of future flooding events, the creek is being reconstructed (through 2019) and left as greenspace. As an effect of the recession, by 2013, thirty-two percent of mortgages in the city were upside-down. While remaining the largest city in Illinois outside Chicago and its suburbs, estimated population decline from 2010 to 2017 led Rockford to be overtaken by Joliet and Naperville (the latter, slightly), effectively making it the fifth-largest city in Illinois.

From 2014 to 2018, the unemployment rate in Rockford has fallen from 12.9 percent to 4.4 percent (the lowest since 2000). While predominately a manufacturing community since World War II, Rockford has struggled to diversify its industrial base. Shifting from agricultural machinery and furniture, manufacturing in the city remains dominated by fasteners, automotive suppliers (representing FCA Belvidere Assembly), and the aerospace industry (Woodward and Collins Aerospace; the latter, tracing its roots to Sundstrand Corporation). In 2012, Woodward selected suburban Loves Park for a $200 million manufacturing campus toward its energy control and optimization systems. Boeing included Rockford in a list of five finalists to manufacture the 777X during union disputes in 2014. In 2016, AAR Corporation opened a MRO facility at the Rockford airport with a hangar large enough to fit a Boeing 747-8.

During the 2010s, all three major health care providers in Rockford underwent major expansions of their facilities. SwedishAmerican, in partnership with the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, opened a $39 million Regional Cancer Center in 2013. In 2014, MercyHealth (based in Janesville, Wisconsin) acquired Rockford Health System, the operator of Rockford Memorial Hospital. In 2019, MercyHealth opened Javon Bea Hospital-Riverside (named after the MercyHealth CEO and its Riverside Boulevard/Interstate 90 location); its second hospital in Rockford, the $505 million complex was the largest construction project in the history of the city.

In July 2024, a 200-year flooding event overwhelmed the city&#x27;s stormwater management systems, killing at least one.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Rockford has an area of , of which (or 98.6%) is land and (or 1.4%) is water. Located primarily in Winnebago County, a portion extends into neighboring Ogle County. Rockford is approximately 90 miles west-northwest of downtown Chicago, and 70 miles south-southeast of Madison.

===Waterways===
The Rock River forms the traditional center of Rockford and is its most recognizable natural feature. One of its largest tributaries, the Kishwaukee River, joins the Rock River at the southern end of the city near the Rockford airport. Since the 1946 closure of Camp Grant, much of the length of Kishwaukee has been redeveloped into parkland and forest preserves, effectively forming the southern border of the city. Other waterways that feed into the Rock River include Spring Creek (northeast region), Keith Creek (east region), and Kent Creek (west region). Of the 8 Illinois dams of the Rock River, the Fordham dam is located south of downtown.

==Arts and culture==


Compared to Katowice by writer Leopold Tyrmand, Rockford possesses a wealth of notable architecture. The Lake-Peterson House, constructed by alderman John Lake in 1873 and preserved by Swedish industrialist Pehr August Peterson, is a notable example of Gothic Revival. Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, it is used for the School of Medical Technology of the Rockford-based Swedish American Hospital.

Further Swedish influence on Rockford during the Victorian era is represented in the Erlander Home Museum, the base of the Swedish Historical Society. Swiss influence can be seen in the Tinker Swiss Cottage, which was opened as a museum under the park district in 1943 and was featured in an episode of Ghost Hunters in 2012.

Modern architectural movements, like Art Deco and Prairie School, are also integral to Rockford. Most renowned is the Coronado Theatre, a civic and entertainment center named one of 150 Great Places in Illinois by the American Institute of Architects. The theater is known for its blend of Art Deco with Spanish Baroque Revival and has hosted numerous performers over its lifetime, including the Marx Brothers, Frank Sinatra, and Bob Dylan. The 186-foot tall Faust Hotel complements the Coronado; constructed in 1929, it endures as Rockford&#x27;s tallest building, albeit as apartments for the elderly and disabled. The Laurent House, a single-story Usonian home constructed in 1952 by Frank Lloyd Wright, is the only Wright building designed for a person with disabilities. Acquired by a private foundation from its commissioners, it was renovated into a museum in 2014. The Rockford Area has two additional places named by the American Institute of Architects in the 150 Great Places, Anderson Japanese Gardens in Rockford, Illinois and Poplar Grove United Methodist Church in Poplar Grove, Illinois.

Anderson Japanese Gardens, modeled after the Portland Japanese Garden and landscaped by Hoichi Kurisu, is 10 acres in size and features a teahouse and guesthouse in the sukiya-zukuri style. Klehm Arboretum and Botanic Garden is 155 acres in size and is noted for its selection of both indigenous and foreign plant species.

The Burpee Museum of Natural History is home to the world&#x27;s most complete juvenile &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;, Jane, as well as a &quot;Triceratops&quot;, Homer. The Discovery Center Museum, a children&#x27;s museum featuring over 250 hands-on exhibits including a planetarium. The Burpee Museum and the Discovery Center Museum, along with the Rockford Art Museum and the bases for Northern Public Radio, the Rockford Dance Company, and the Rockford Symphony Orchestra make up the downtown Riverfront Museum Park complex. The last museum under the park district&#x27;s authority is Midway Village and Museum Center, a recreation of a Victorian-era village. The eastern riverwalk of Rockford is maintained by the park district, featuring the Nicholas Conservatory and Gardens. Located on the bank of the Rock River, the conservatory is the third-largest in the state of Illinois. Just north of the gardens is &quot;Symbol&quot;, an Alexander Liberman sculpture moved from downtown during the 1980s and now one of Rockford&#x27;s most recognizable features.

In 2021, artist Rafael Blanco painted &quot;Thinking of you Rockford&quot; in Rockford, Illinois. The 22-foot by 77-foot piece featured a young Black female dreaming alongside math and science illustrations.

In April 2018, Rockford became included in the LimeBike bicycle-sharing network. Using 500 commuter bicycles supplied by the company, residents rent bicycles through a mobile app, unlocking the dockless bicycles. Distinguished by their bright green color, LimeBikes are equipped with a basket, lights, and GPS (to locate them for rental); one-speed and three-speed units are in use.

In early 2019, LimeBike was discontinued in Rockford; the company shifted its business model away from bicycles to e-scooters.

===Air===

The first airport serving the Rockford area was Machesney Airport, located north of the city alongside US 51. Opened in 1927, the airport was initially a private airport; during World War II, it was utilized by the Army Air Corps. After the war, Machesney Airport was opened as a municipal airport. In 1974, the location was closed, becoming the site of the Machesney Park Mall in 1980.

After Camp Grant&#x27;s final closure in 1946, the state legislature allowed for the establishment of an airport to serve Rockford, leading to the creation of the Greater Rockford Airport Authority (GRAA). In 1948, the GRAA received a 1500-acre portion of the Camp Grant property between US 51 and the Rock River, located between the southern border of the city and New Milford.

From the 1950s to 1970s, the Greater Rockford Airport served as a regional airport, with small airlines offering both turboprop and jet service. To further expand passenger service, the current passenger terminal was constructed in 1987. Competing against easy highway access (and bus service) to O&#x27;Hare International Airport, the airport struggled for passenger service during the 1990s, leading to the loss of passenger service from 2001 to 2003. Since 2003, the airport has restored passenger service, primarily marketing its location for leisure travelers. Following the closure of several airlines, the location is served by Allegiant Air as its passenger carrier. Following a 2005 upgrade, the passenger terminal was expanded in size in 2018.

During the 2000s, the airport underwent several name changes, adopting the current Chicago Rockford International Airport moniker in 2007. Among the fastest-growing freight airports in the world, full-scale cargo operations began in 1994 as United Parcel Service (UPS) opened an air package hub at the airport next to the terminal. Second only to Worldport in the UPS Airlines operations, the Rockford UPS hub operates on a separate 50-acre ramp (parking up to 40 aircraft at a time), accommodating up to a Boeing 747-8F.

Next to the UPS facilities, another cargo ramp was built in 2008, intended to attract additional cargo airlines. In 2016, the facilities were leased by ABX, intending to transfer freight from aircraft to trucks; the operations transitioned into flights for Amazon Air, who partners with ABX, ATI, and Atlas Air. The same year, AAR Corporation opened an FBO facility on the southern end of the airport, building hangars large enough to accommodate an Airbus A380. In 2021, cargo operations were expanded further, as the airport constructed an additional cargo-handling facility and cargo ramp, introducing service by German air cargo company Senator International, contracting 747s by Air Atlanta Icelandic. In 2022, Korean Air Cargo introduced cargo service from Seoul to Rockford on 777-300 freighters, becoming the longest flight from the airport.

===Rail===
====Passenger====

For over four decades, the Rockford region has not been served by passenger rail. From 1974 to 1981, Rockford was served by Amtrak via its &quot;Black Hawk&quot; route, a daily train service from Dubuque, Iowa to Union Station in Chicago with a stop in Rockford. The &quot;Black Hawk&quot; was discontinued in September 1981 as part of funding cuts to Amtrak.

During the 2000s, interest increased in relinking the Rockford and Chicago regions by rail. In 2006, the Northern Illinois Commuter Transportation Initiative proposed extending Metra train service from the western Chicago suburbs to Rockford. During the early 2010s, there was design work on a planned 2015 revival of the &quot;Black Hawk&quot; route on Canadian National rails, with Rockford as the initial terminus. As part of the ongoing Illinois financial crisis, state funding for the &quot;Black Hawk&quot; revival was suspended in February 2015, putting the project on hold. The service was later funded in 2019 with the support of Governor J.B. Pritzker. In 2023, it was announced that Metra would provide service to Rockford as an extension of the Milwaukee District West Line, with twice-daily service in each direction beginning in 2027.

====Freight====
Rockford is served by several different freight railroad lines, the Union Pacific, the Canadian National, the Iowa, Chicago &amp; Eastern (Canadian Pacific), and the Illinois Railway. The Union Pacific line from West Chicago terminates in Rockford at a small yard.

The Canadian National line from Addison enters from the Southeast and leaves in the Northwest. They have a small yard where they interchange with the Illinois Railway. The Illinois Railway Rockford Line comes from the South, joins the Canadian National line, where they continue on trackage rights to the Canadian National yard. Canadian Pacific (Iowa, Chicago, and Eastern) runs on Illinois Railway trackage rights from Davis Junction, and leaves on their own trackage to the North. All of the railroads interchange at a yard off of Main Street.

The Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s Global III Intermodal Facility is approximately south of Rockford in Rochelle, Illinois, a community of 10,000. The complex is one of the world&#x27;s largest intermodal facilities. Construction on the state-of-the-art facility was completed in 2003 in Rochelle due to the close proximity to four interstate highways (I-39, I-88, I-80, and I-90) and rail routes.

<text>Rockton is a village in Winnebago County, Illinois. It is located in the Rock River Valley and is part of the Rockford metropolitan area. The population was 7,685 at the time of the 2010 census, up from 5,296 at the time of the 2000 census.

== History ==
Native American tribes originally inhabited the region. Stephen Mack, Jr. was the first white settler in the Rockton area. He was married to Hononegah, a respected Native American woman from one of the surrounding tribes. His original outpost (c. 1830s) eventually became Macktown. William Talcott arrived to the area later and, after a disagreement with Mack, settled on the other side of the nearby river within the present village of Rockton. Citizens who lived in Macktown would frequently travel across the river to Rockton but in 1851, the bridge from Macktown to Rockton washed away. The bridge had been built with funding from Stephen Mack and its destruction, along with Mack&#x27;s death in 1850, led citizens to permanently move to Rockton. In northern Illinois, Macktown is the only community from the 1830s that is still standing without subsequent development.
On June 14, 2021, a large explosion and subsequent fire affected the Chemtool Lubrication production plant in Rockton.

==History==
All historical knowledge is from the book, &quot;Our Golden History-South Beloit Illinois&quot;, which is a non-copyrighted work by Cathryn Hayes. She wrote the book to inform the people South Beloit of their roots.

===Natural history===

What is now South Beloit was previously full of natural resources such as copper, lead, and bog iron. Buff and blue limestones were plentiful everywhere in Winnebago County, with limestone forming the banks of the Rock River and Turtle Creek. The buff limestone gave the first settlers material for their houses and public buildings, some of which can still be seen in Rockford, Rockton, and Beloit/South Beloit. The older homes in South Beloit had basement walls of this limestone. The South Beloit area has a thick deposit of sand, and industries were built here because of its unusually fine quality. A fine quality of clay was also found in the state line area.

===Earliest residents===
Many Peoples have inhabited South Beloit over the years, including the Mound Builders, Sioux, and Illinswek (Illinois). The Turtle Indians of the area were the Winnebago Tribe, Siouan family. They had villages all along the Rock River and Turtle Creek. One large village was in modern-day South Beloit and all the way up to northeast Beloit. It was named for an important chief, Kau Rau Maw Nee (Walking Turtle). Turtle later became modern day Beloit and South Beloit.

===Beloit divided===
In 1818, Congress told the people of the Illinois Territory to draft a constitution and adopt a state government. A heated debate arose over the correct placement of the northern state line of Illinois. Most people in the lead region around Galena and the northern part of the territory did not want to be part of the proposed state because of a large debt and tax for internal improvements. The northern part was against slavery (still practiced in the southern part) and wanted a Lake Michigan shoreline. If the old line of 1787 were kept, Illinois would be much smaller than Wisconsin, placing Chicago in Wisconsin and leaving Illinois with no Lake Michigan shoreline. Getting exasperated with the debate, Nathaniel Pope, who represented Illinois, went ahead and proposed the bill to Congress cutting 8,500 square miles off of Wisconsin and adding it to Illinois. Thus the current state line was created. 

===A farming community===
Illinois had become a state in 1818, Winnebago County was organized in January 1836, and public surveys started in the fall of 1836. Government sale of lands started in 1837–39, but Rockton Township sale was held until 1843 because of claims made by Polish exiles in 1843 for land previously held by early settlers in and around Rockton and Rockford. Their claims were discounted and the land was put up for sale when the land commission declared the Polish Count had not fulfilled the terms of the agreement. He was to have the choice of three adjacent townships and live on the land, making improvements for ten years. The Polish had chosen Townships 44 and 46, Range 1, East, and not 45 and had not settled on the land. The early settlers held the land by squatters’ rights and were now able to buy their farms from the government for $1.25 an acre.

This was also the time when Winnebago County tried to secede from Illinois and attach itself to Wisconsin. The people living there disapproved of the $14,000,000 debt for internal improvements with an empty treasury and insufficient revenue. The southern part of the state was poor and unprogressive, in contrast to the industrious north. Winnebago County voted in 1842 for annexation to Wisconsin. 972 voted for it, and only 6 voted against it. However, the south had more people and out-voted the north. So Winnebago County remained in Illinois.

By 1838, the village of Turtle had grown large enough to resent the Indian name it had used for so long. They also rejected the suggestion of &#x27;New Albany&#x27;. A committee (or possibly two committees) was chosen to propose a new name. The French word for nice or pretty is &#x27;bellotte&#x27;. The committee members, remembering a happy time in Detroit, sounded the word for pretty and came up with Balloit, then Beloit. The name was approved, reported to the settlement, and accepted. South Beloit became the south part of Beloit.

===Becoming a city===
By the early 1900s, the city was thriving according to the standards if the time. With 1200 people living there, it petitioned other governments to become a city in 1914. The petition was approved, and in May 1917, a special election was held to file for incorporation. The election passed and South Beloit became a city on September 17, 1917. The initial city did not include a certain portion to the West side of the city, which joined the city on May 2, 1921.

===Police and fire departments===
The police department was established as one of the first departments by ordinance No.13, October 1917. It started off as a one-man, part-time enforcement. The first squad car was purchased from Saris Auto Company in 1923 for $431.71. In October 1928, the department bought a motorcycle from the Beloit Police for $100. In April 1957, the department became radio operated by the purchase of a Motorola Police Base Station for $587 and the hiring of Richard Miller as the first radio operator for $316 a month.

In February 1927, there was a bond issue to remodel City Hall, which included the establishment of a fire department and purchase of fire equipment. The first group of volunteers met in fall, 1927 and, with the help of Beloit firemen, learned how to use the equipment and effectively fight fires. The fire truck, a W.S. Knott, was manufactured in Minneapolis and delivered in February 1928 by Clare Hillman, who was familiar with its operation and became the first fire chief. The first uniformed department was made up of twelve members, plus Chief Hillman. These early volunteers were Edward Brady, George Graves, George Holtz, Arthur Schultz, David Bliss, James Howard, John Jensen, Thomas Flanigan, Robert Smith, Everett Clussman, Erwin Earl, and Fay Hanson.

===School history===
In 1859 a group of settlers living on the east side of the city purchased a piece of land from Dr. E.N.Clark for $125. The school house, costing $621, was built on that property. The district at the time of the purchase was District No.11, Town of Rockton, Winnebago County, and was called Clark School after Dr. Clark.

Another South Beloit school was Butler School, started at least by 1877 and probably around 1859, on the other side of the river. Mrs. Marguerite Warren, a teacher long ago in South Beloit, compiled a list of some of the students that went to the old Butler School. Ed Burger, Charles Burger, Mrs. Castner, Melvin Lynch, Elloit Warren, Magda Guetschow, Martha Guetschow, Marie Guetschow, William Guetschow, Oscar Nordt, Frances Perkins, Oscar Swanson, Elmer Swanson, Bill Stanley, Everett Chapel, and Henry Zempel were the ones she was able to remember.

Three of the early teachers at Butler were Maud Whetstone, Kitty Aspland, and William Gharrity. At Clark the first teacher was Lewis Bixby who got $26 a month for five winter months and had to pay his own board. Miss Jennie Kimball taught the following summer for $4 a week. The enrollment at Clark was from six to twenty pupils in the early years. During the Civil War, the school year was reduced. The Clarks, Stantons, Hutchisons, Herseys, Hayeses, Helms, and HaPBC Linear (Pacific Bearing)

===Cannabis legalization===
South Beloit&#x27;s economy has benefited from the legalization of cannabis in Illinois due to its location on the Illinois-Wisconsin state line, as cannabis remains illegal in Wisconsin. The city has received a significant amount of tax revenue since the opening of the town&#x27;s first recreational cannabis dispensary in 2020. The city&#x27;s economy is only expected to further benefit from this industry as a second dispensary was opened along the state line in January 2025.

==Transportation==
Local bus service in the city is provided by Beloit Transit as well as Stateline Mass Transit District. Van Galder Bus Company provides intercity bus service to Chicago, Madison and points in between.
South Beloit was served by the Milwaukee Road with lines running between Davis Junction and Janesville and Racine and Kittredge.

<text>Germantown Hills is a village in Woodford County, Illinois, approximately northeast of Peoria. Germantown Hills is the only incorporated community in Worth Township. As of the 2010 census, the village had a total population of 3,438. Largely an agricultural community until its incorporation in 1954, Germantown Hills is now a growing bedroom community in the Peoria Metropolitan Area.

==History==
Settlement of the area began as early as November 1831, when Methodist Rev. Zadock Hall began preaching in modern-day Worth Township. Soon after, an iron foundry was opened by settler Philip Klein. By 1837, a Catholic church was organized by German Catholics in the area. In 1850, William Hoshor built a tavern and hotel named the Germantown House, for which the village would be named more than 100 years later. A steam sawmill was built in 1860, and in the 1890s, the Union House was erected as a tavern, grocery store, and saloon.

The area remained almost completely agricultural until the incorporation of Oak Grove Park in 1954. The village&#x27;s founders wished to use the name &quot;Germantown&quot; to reflect Hoshor&#x27;s Germantown House and the area&#x27;s large German-American representation. Still, the name was taken by a village in southern Illinois. Upon its incorporation, the population of Oak Grove Park was 182. In 1967, the name Oak Grove Park was dropped in favor of Germantown Hills. The village&#x27;s population would rise steadily until the 1980 census, when the annexation of the Whispering Oaks subdivision brought the number to 524. Subsequent development and annexation brought the population to 1195 by 1990. Rampant development, fueled by suburbanization in the Peoria Metropolitan Area, brought the population to its most-recent count of 3,438.

<doc id="112100" wikidata="Q3252031" url="?curid=112100" title="Kappa, Illinois">
<text>Kappa is a village in Woodford County, Illinois, United States. The population was 227 at the 2010 census, up from 170 in 2000. It is part of the Peoria, Illinois Metropolitan Statistical Area.

In 1833 Thomas Dixon became the first settler in the Kappa area. Over the next few years, other settlers moved in around the area, and eventually a railroad was built through the area. On May 23, 1853, rail service began, and postal service began. The first postmaster, William Jones, appointed the name &quot;Montrose&quot;, but the Illinois Central Railroad preferred Kappa. Kappa is the tenth letter in the Greek alphabet, and was applied to the town because it was the tenth town between Dunleith (modern-day East Dubuque, Illinois) and Bloomington.

Kappa sits on the north side of the Mackinaw River. Approximately five miles to the southeast is Lake Bloomington, while five miles to the southwest is Evergreen Lake.

Since its inception, the railroad line from East Dubuque to Bloomington has been decommissioned. In the early 1900s, SBI Route 2 was founded, and then changed to U.S. Route 51. U.S. 51 now bypasses the town to the west, leaving Illinois Route 251 as the main north–south road through town.

==Name==
Metamora was founded as &quot;Hanover&quot; in 1836. It was named for Hanover, New Hampshire by a consortium of land speculators called the Hanover Company. New post office conventions required towns to have unique names, forcing the town to differentiate itself from others in Illinois named Hanover. Early post office names included &quot;Black Partridge&quot; (1836) and &quot;Partridge Point&quot; (1837). The name of the village was finally changed to &quot;Metamora&quot; in 1845 based on the character in the popular play &quot;Metamora; or, The Last of the Wampanoags&quot;. The village still has a Hanover Street and Partridge Street, reflecting these earlier names. Also, a popular location Black Partridge Park.

==History==
Metamora was settled by Yankee settlers. These were people from New England who were descended from the English Puritans who settled that region in the 1600s.

A New England man named John Page scouted the area for the company and decided that this particular tract of land would be a good place for farms. When they arrived the area was a forest, with no roads and no structures. The New Hampshire settlers cleared the forest, constructed roads and built farms as well as a small town to support the farms. Other New England settlers arrived shortly thereafter from the states of Rhode Island, Vermont and Massachusetts. Metamora was the county seat of Woodford County from 1843 until 1896.

==History==
The founding of Minonk corresponds with the construction of the Illinois Central Railroad. The Illinois Central Railroad main line was completed in 1854 and ran through Section Seven, eventually becoming the City of Minonk. The plat of the town was first recorded on November 7, 1854.

David Neal, an agent with the Illinois Central Railroad, is credited for naming the city. Local folklore provides varying accounts about the origins of the name “Minonk.” One version states that he originally named the area after a street in Boston, where he owned property. A second story suggests that he changed the name of the settlement, originally referred to as “Marquette” on old French maps, to the Ojibwe word “Minonk,” meaning “a good place.” Minonk is the only city in the world with that name.

Early settlers were attracted to Minonk by a variety of livelihoods. Many came to work on the railroad. Others settled in the area to farm on the abundant, rich farmland. However, coal mining was the leading industry in the early years of Minonk. The first coal mines were developed in the 1860s, and at one point employed over 300 men. Two mines operated in Minonk: the first mine was located on the north edge of the city, and the second was situated a half-mile north of town.

==Sports==
Minonk is home to Fieldcrest High School and their football team the Fieldcrest Knights.

== History ==

Some sources, including Stewart, pg. 362, as well as several Woodford County history books claim the name Panola was fabricated by J.B. Calhoun, land commissioner of the Illinois Central Railroad, by arbitrarily combining single consonants and vowels. However, the 1954 El Paso Story correctly records that while Panola was assigned by an official of the Illinois Central Railroad, it simply duplicates the name of Panola County, Mississippi as well as several municipalities in the southern U.S. named Panola. Panola is a Native American word for cotton.

Because of its aging population and apparent lack of enthusiasm for others to be involved in operation of the local government, in 2004 the village board of Panola attempted to unincorporate the town. Only one other town in Illinois had successfully unincorporated previously. Of the 33 residents at the time, 27 had voting rights. The measure failed 16 to 11. It needed a majority to pass.

<text>Roanoke is a village in Roanoke Township, Woodford County, Illinois, United States. The population was 1,960 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Peoria, Illinois Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
===Early settlement===
Until about 1850, much of northern Illinois was still frontier land and sparsely populated, which the exception of Chicago and towns along the rivers. This changed in 1850, when President Millard Fillmore signed a land grant for the construction of the Illinois Central Railroad, lobbied for by then-lawyers Stephen Douglas and Abraham Lincoln. With the railroad expanding into Central Illinois, new opportunities for settlement by German, Dutch, Irish, Italian, Swedish, and other European immigrants opened up in Woodford County.

Roanoke was one of these settlements. On December 17, 1872, Roanoke was mapped out and lots were offered for sale. The plat of Roanoke was composed of 15 blocks and was bounded by Main, Front, Ann and Pleasant Streets. Two years later in 1874, Roanoke officially became a &quot;Village&quot; in the State of Illinois. Building began immediately in Roanoke and by the time the railroad was complete the population had increased to three hundred. On August 15, 1874, the first election was held for the purpose of electing six trustees for the Village of Roanoke. To this day, the Village has continually filled those six positions.

===Coal mining===
The Roanoke area, like most of Illinois, is underlain by rich veins of coal. The second coal shaft in Woodford County was sunk in Roanoke in 1881. Another shaft started in a westerly direction, but this coal was &quot;flinty&quot;, or mixed with rock, and digging was discontinued. The mine at its peak employed around 300 men and hoisted 500 tons of coal a day.

As was the case in most small mining towns, life in the mines could be dangerous. In the June 29th, 1906, four men fell 400 feet down the main shaft to their deaths while performing maintenance and improvements to the main shaft. After the accident, the coal mine continued to operate until 1940, when it was permanently closed due to safety concerns and maintenance issues. In 1941, due to its state of disrepair, the tipple at the mine head collapsed into the shaft, leaving a crater. The crater was filled in, and the remaining equipment sold as scrap.

Slate, flint, and other non-coal slag from the old mine was collected into a large mound colloquially called the &quot;Jumbo,&quot; on the southern side of the village near where the mine was once located. Since before the mine closed, it is estimated that 800,000 tons of slag from the Jumbo has been used in various road and town improvement construction projects. Although smaller than its original size, the Jumbo still stands at present, topped with an electric star that is illuminated during the Christmas season.

===Railroad closure===
After the Roanoke mine stopped operation in 1940, and with the growing popularity of using Semi-trailer trucks to move crops from farm to market, the rail line running through Roanoke was eventually retired in the mid-1980s, and was promptly dismantled for scrap. The original Roanoke rail station still stands as a historic building.

===2004 tornado===

On July 13, 2004, an F4 tornado demolished several rural houses and properties, and the Parsons Manufacturing Plant approximately west of downtown Roanoke. While over 200 people were still inside the Parsons plant at the time, the event was notable because there were no serious injuries or fatalities, and also because numerous photos and videos were taken of it.

<doc id="112107" wikidata="Q1779942" url="?curid=112107" title="Berne, Indiana">
<text>Berne (English: [bɜːn]) is a city within Monroe and Wabash townships, Adams County, Indiana, United States, located south of Fort Wayne. The population was 4,173 at the 2020 Census. Berne is widely known for its Swiss heritage, architecture and culture, and for its status as the &quot;&quot;Furniture Capital of Indiana&quot;.&quot;

Berne and the surrounding area have also become known for their large Amish population (the fifth largest Amish community in the USA), who speak Bernese German (a Swiss German dialect), as opposed to Pennsylvania Dutch.

==History==
Berne was settled in 1852 by Mennonite immigrants who came directly from Switzerland (Münsterberg, in the Jura Mountains near Moutier) and named the community after their homeland&#x27;s capital. 
Berne initially formed around a rail depot placed on the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad lines. On Christmas Day 1871, the first train arrived at the local depot. A post office was established in Berne in 1872. After the population of the town exceeded 2,500, on a petition of two-thirds of the residents, the town decided to become a city in 1887. By 1895 the community was the second largest city in the county.

The General Conference of the Mennonite Church has been held in Berne four times - in 1884, 1902, 1926 and 1947. The First Mennonite Church in Berne is the largest of its kind in North America, and previously had the largest congregation. It is affiliated with the Lancaster Mennonite Conference. The official publishing company of the General Conference Mennonite Church, the &quot;Mennonite Book Concern,&quot; was located in Berne from 1884 until 1939, when it moved to North Newton, Kansas, which was the &quot;de facto&quot; seat of the Mennonite Church at the time. 

==Geography==
Berne is located in northeastern Indiana.

According to the 2010 census, Berne has a total area of , all land.

=== Teays River ===
An ancient pre-glacial river known as the Teays River (about the size of the Ohio River), with its headwaters near present-day Blowing Rock, North Carolina, used to pass through Virginia, West Virginia and Ohio and run just east of Berne before flowing southwest through the present town of Geneva into Jay County. It then continued its course across Indiana into Illinois, draining most of the east-central United States. The glaciers of the last Ice Age (the Pleistocene) bisected the Teays River Valley and buried it underneath at least 400 feet of glacial drift (the largest remaining piece is the Kanawha River of West Virginia). Although the river does not flow anymore, the underground Teays River Valley still contains significant water deposits, making Berne and Geneva very water-rich areas. Wells just to the east of Berne provide the much larger city of Decatur (c.10 miles north) with a large proportion of its water supply. The current locations of many wetland areas, such as Limberlost Swamp Nature Preserve, Loblolly Marsh Nature Preserve, Limberlost Park and Rainbow Bend Park lie over the old Teays River Valley.

== Education ==

=== Public ===
K-12 public education in Berne is provided by South Adams Schools. South Adams Jr./Sr. High School shares its building with the Elementary and Middle Schools. Their nickname is the Starfires.

Four area schools consolidated into &quot;South Adams&quot; just prior to the 1966–67 school year. They were the &quot;Berne Bears&quot;, the &quot;Geneva Cardinals&quot;, the &quot;Hartford Gorillas&quot;, and the &quot;Jefferson Warriors.&quot; Though the consolidated school was located in Berne, as a compromise the school took a new name and mascot - &quot;The South Adams Starfires&quot; - ostensibly named after the first principal/superintendent&#x27;s car (an Oldsmobile Starfire).

===Library===
The Berne Public Library, which opened its doors in 1935 and is currently located in the former city auditorium, serves the city of Berne. The library provides information services to all ages and holds over 60,000 titles, including print, digital, audio, and visual forms. The Heritage Room of the Berne Public Library contains local history and genealogical information.

== Culture ==


=== Swiss Days Celebration ===
The annual Swiss Days Celebration in Berne is held the last Friday and Saturday in July and attracts thousands of visitors every year as locals celebrate their Swiss and American culture.

===City parks===
==== Muensterberg Plaza and Clock Tower ====
The idea of building the clock tower and plaza was first raised in 2001 while the city of Berne was planning for its sesquicentennial. Wanting to celebrate the city&#x27;s Swiss heritage, it was decided to model the clock tower after the medieval Zytglogge in Bern, Switzerland, the oldest monument in that city (built c. 1220, repaired in 1405). The clock tower and plaza were given the name Muensterberg (Münsterberg) after the small Mennonite community in the Jura Mountains of Switzerland that Berne&#x27;s first immigrants came from. The clock tower was constructed in 2010. It stands 160 feet tall and 32 feet wide, weighing approximately 1,216 tons (over 2.4 million pounds). It contains carillon bells created by the Verdin Company.

The Muensterberg Plaza built around the clock tower also features The Settler&#x27;s Statue commemorating the arrival of the first settlers to the area, the only stateside Canton Tree, and a series of flowerbeds laid out to resemble common quilting patterns.

==== Lehman Park ====
Lehman Park is a wooded 11.5-acre park located at the intersection of US 27 and Park Avenue. The land for the park was donated to the city of Berne by Isaac and Caroline Lehman in 1928.

== Media ==
Berne is served by one tri-weekly newspaper, &quot;The Berne Witness&quot;. At one time both German and English editions were offered; the former was later discontinued.

Berne, along with the rest of Adams County, is served by WZBD.

<text>Decatur is a city in Root and Washington townships, Adams County, Indiana, United States. It is the county seat (and the largest community) of Adams County. Decatur is home to Adams Memorial Hospital, which was designated as one of the &quot;Top 100&quot; Critical Access Hospitals in the United States. The population of Decatur was 9,913 at the 2020 census, up from 9,405 at the 2010 census.

==History==

===Founding===
The first non-Native American settlers arrived in what is now Decatur in 1835. They arrived as a result of the end of the Black Hawk War as well as the completion of the Erie Canal. They consisted entirely of settlers from New England. These were &quot;Yankee&quot; settlers, that is to say they were descended from the English Puritans who settled New England in the colonial era. They were primarily members of the Congregational Church though due to the Second Great Awakening many of them had converted to Methodism and some had become Baptists before coming to what is now Decatur. The Congregational Church subsequently has gone through many divisions and some factions are now known as the Church of Christ and Church of God. When the New England settlers arrived in what is now Decatur there was nothing but a dense virgin forest and wild prairie.

Decatur was founded by Samuel Rugg in 1836. It was named for Stephen Decatur, Jr., one of the captains of the original six frigates of the US navy. A post office was established in Decatur in 1837.

===Post-Civil War history===
After the Civil War, Decatur was known as a sundown town, where African Americans were discriminated against and eventually run out of the town completely in 1902. In a &quot;New York Times&quot; article published on July 14, 1902, the headline read, &quot;Negro Driven Away,&quot; and it recounted the story of the violent mob attacks which drove away African Americans from Decatur during the summer of 1902. The last line from the article explicitly concluded, &quot;The anti-negroites declare that as Decatur is now cleared of Negroes they will keep it so, and the importation of any more will undoubtedly result in serious trouble.&quot; A month before the last Black person was reportedly forced out of Decatur, the &quot;Indianapolis Freeman&quot; reported that 50 men began driving the Black people out because they &quot;were determined that colored people should not live in the town.&quot; Eventually African Americans began slowly settling in town; however, due to the sundown policies that persisted throughout much of the 1900s, the current demographics still indicate a low percentage of Black residents.

<text>Geneva is a town in Wabash Township, Adams County, Indiana. The population was 1,293 at the time of the 2010 census. Geneva is the location of the Limberlost Cabin, the home of writer and naturalist Gene Stratton-Porter from 1895-1913.

==History==
Geneva had its start in 1871 when the rival towns of Alexander and Buffalo merged. It was named after Geneva, in Switzerland. The first post office in Geneva was established in 1872.

The Town of Geneva benefited greatly from the Indiana Gas Boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Oil was found near Geneva and production began in 1892. This brought many new settlers to the area and skyrocketed local land prices. At its height in November 1895, one company, the Buckeye Pipe Line Company, had 160 oil wells in the Geneva field producing 24,362 barrels a month. Production fell off after 1907. Charles D. Porter and his wife, Gene Stratton-Porter, who lived in Geneva from 1886-1913, owned roughly 30 oil wells in the area, and used the proceeds to build Limberlost Cabin in 1895.

<text>Huntertown is a town in Allen County, Indiana. The population was 9,141 at the time of the 2020 census, making it one of the fastest-growing areas in northeastern Indiana, with a population increase of 90 percent since 2010.

==History==

Huntertown was originally referred to as &quot;The Opening&quot; due to it being a natural forest clearing. Huntertown was first settled &quot;circa&quot; 1837 and was founded by William T. Hunter. The village was located along the Lima Plank Road connecting Lima (now Howe) and Fort Wayne. The Perry Centre Seminary was founded in Huntertown in 1856, only to close five years later when the entire faculty and adult students enlisted in the Union Army. The town was platted in 1869, but not incorporated until 1966.

Some of the nation&#x27;s oldest reliable weather observations are from a nineteenth-century Huntertown farm. Rapin Andrews began keeping meteorological records on July 17, 1839, and continued until his death ten years later. His family continued the observations until April 30, 1874. The diary of weather records was presented to the U.S. Weather Bureau (now the National Weather Service) in 1934. The record highest temperature was in July 1846 and the record lowest temperature was on January 29, 1873.

===Recent developments===
Since much of Huntertown&#x27;s growth has come from people moving from urbanized areas like Fort Wayne to new suburban subdivisions, the expectations for services have increased. For example, the town council expanded from three to five members to lessen the workload. The council now is working on creating a new water plant, a parks board, and a new park.

The town&#x27;s weekly newspaper, &quot;Northwest News&quot;, began operations in the summer of 1997 in the former Huntertown State Bank, site of a 1930s robbery by the John Dillinger gang.

==Geography==
Huntertown is located at (41.227798, -85.169371) at an elevation of and sits along State Road 3/Lima Road just north of Fort Wayne. Carroll Road is the southern boundary line between Huntertown and Fort Wayne.

New Haven was the westernmost point of prehistoric glacial Lake Maumee which was an extension of Lake Erie. The bed of Lake Maumee then became the Great Black Swamp, which covered an area between New Haven and present-day Toledo, Ohio. The route of the old Lincoln Highway east of New Haven follows the southern lakebank of glacial Lake Maumee, a notable geological feature.

<text>Woodburn is a city in Maumee Township, Allen County, Indiana, United States. The population was 1,520 at the 2010 census, making it the smallest in state as Cannelton had a population of 1,563 in the 2010 Census.

==History==
In 1865 Joseph Edgerton and Joseph Smith platted the town of Woodburn, or Phelps Station as it was called at that time. The two men chose this area due to the abundant timber, fertile ground, and nearby river. After
two large, accidental fires in the area Joseph Edgerton sent his son Edward Edgerton to Woodburn to sell off large tracts of land for farming.

This area was first known as Phelps Station due to the train depot. There were five families and a post office. In September 1865 the town was again platted with the name Woodburn due to the enormous wood burnings to clear the land. In 1895 a group of local men decided to incorporate the town into Shirley City in honor of Senator Robert B Shirley.

Once again in 1956 a special meeting was called where the decision was made to return the name to Woodburn and officially become the smallest 5th class city in Indiana.
The hard working pioneers who migrated to this area are to be commended for clearing the land for cultivation and implementing the drainage system. This cleared the way for commerce in the city.

The Stucky brothers started their business in Woodburn selling farm implements and repair. The grain elevator and train station were the leading businesses in the early days. Soon the small city became self-contained with everything from a bank, to grocery stores, drug store, furniture, doctors, blacksmith, restaurants, taverns, stockyard, hotel, butcher shop, brick and tile mill, automobiles, schools and churches.

Due to limited roads and abundant local business, community members did not have to travel outside of Woodburn for their basic needs.

The area surrounding Woodburn was struck by an EF-3 tornado on August 24, 2016.

<text>Edinburgh () is a town in Johnson, Bartholomew, and Shelby counties in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 4,480 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Columbus, Indiana metropolitan statistical area. Edinburgh was named in honor of Edinburgh, Scotland and for many years was pronounced the same way.

Edinburgh is the home of Camp Atterbury, a National Guard training facility. The Big Blue River and Sugar Creek join to form the Driftwood River west of Edinburgh.

==History==
Edinburgh was laid out in about 1822. A founder of the town being a native of Scotland may have caused the name Edinburgh to be selected. The Edinburgh post office has been in operation since 1823. Early in its history it was sometimes referred to as the town of Edinburg.

Edinburgh Commercial Historic District, South Walnut Street Historic District, and Toner Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===June 3, 2008, Tornado===
Severe thunderstorms formed rapidly across Central Indiana on the evening of June 3, 2008. These storms began to rotate and produced multiple tornadoes. One of these tornadoes traveled across northern sections of Brown County and southern sections of Johnson County. This tornado did considerable damage to the Camp Atterbury facility. The tornado exited Camp Atterbury and crossed US 31, entering the town of Edinburgh. Several buildings and countless trees and power lines were damaged as the tornado moved roughly parallel with Indiana 252. The tornado lifted near Interstate 65. The National Weather Service rated this damaging event as an EF-2 tornado.

===June 7, 2008, Flood===
Several bouts of severe thunderstorm activity and heavy rainfall affected the Edinburgh area in early June 2008. The Big Blue River and Sugar Creek overflowed their banks as a result of this activity. However, the worst of the weather was to come. A line of severe thunderstorms moved across Central Indiana on the evening of June 6, 2008. These storms began to move south out of Edinburgh, weakening as daylight was lost. However, strong surface winds began to interact with a leftover outflow boundary from the earlier severe activity. As a result, new thunderstorm activity began to blossom and move to the east. This interaction produced what is known as a training effect, with thunderstorm after thunderstorm moving over the same area.

The first rainfall began to fall in Edinburgh at approximately 9:00 PM on the evening of June 6. The torrential rain would last until 12:00 PM on June 7. An unofficial rainfall total of was measured in Edinburgh. Official National Weather Service rainfall totals across Central Indiana during this period ranged from to . This water had no place to go as it struck the already saturated grounds, so runoff was extremely high. The Big Blue River and Sugar Creek began to rise rapidly. Runoff quickly flooded agricultural areas and much of this water made its way into several subdivisions in Edinburgh. Many homes were flooded with several feet of water. US 31, SR 252, and Interstate 65 were all flooded at the height of the flood, essentially cutting Edinburgh off from surrounding areas.

<text>Hope is a town in Haw Creek Township, Bartholomew County, Indiana, United States, known for its historic character. The population was 2,102 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Columbus, Indiana, metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
Historically the Delaware tribe lived in what is now Bartholomew County, Indiana, including the region of Hope. After the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794 in Ohio, the Miami tribe moved west and into much of the area inhabited by the Delaware. In turn the Miami were driven out by war with the U.S., and in particular by forces led by John Tipton and Joseph Bartholomew. Tipton and Bartholomew were among the men who fought at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811, forcing the Native Americans to cede more territory to the U.S. government. Later Tipton and Bartholomew came through what is now Bartholomew County, on instructions from the government to &quot;rid the area of Indians.&quot; Many of the Miami were removed to Oklahoma, though a group of Miami remain in Indiana without federal recognition. Indiana was admitted to the union in 1816, and in October 1818, under pressure from the U.S. government, the Miami, Potawatomi, Wea, and Delaware tribes signed treaties with the U.S. exchanging millions of acres of their land in central Indiana for annuities and goods, opening this forest region to settlers looking for lands to farm.

The first settlement at Hope was made in 1830 by a colony of Moravians (people of the Protestant Moravian denomination) from Salem, North Carolina (now Winston-Salem), led by the Rev. Martin Hauser, after whom the town high school is named. Although a 1905 source claimed that the town was named for the optimistic spirit of its Moravian pioneer settlers, &quot;Hope&quot; is a common name for religious settlements, denoting hope in God&#x27;s favor and the resurrection. The town was originally named Goshen, after the Biblical Goshen, but upon the establishment of a post office in 1834 the name was changed to Hope, as Indiana already had a town named Goshen. The town was founded to be a communal settlement like that of the two prominent Moravian settlements in the United States, Salem, North Carolina and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The model for these did not work for a farming community like Hope, and early on the decision was made to end community property and allow residents to own their own land. Soon thereafter the town was also opened to non-Moravians.

In the middle of the nineteenth century a Moravian day school was opened in Hope, and soon thereafter it was decided that the school should be transformed into a boarding school for young women, under the auspices of the Moravian Church. Guidance and funds were provided from the Moravian Church in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and the Hope Moravian Seminary for Young Ladies opened in 1866. A building, a house for the principal and his family, and extensive grounds were situated on what is now Seminary Street. The school was run for thirteen years by the Rev. Francis R. Holland and his wife Augusta Holland, with a number of teachers, and offered a wide program of study, including Latin, English, French, German, music, drawing, mathematics, geography, history, and natural history. Students came from a number of midwestern states. With so many teachers, the school had trouble making ends meet, and in 1879 the Bethlehem elders sent a second principal, the Rev. Jesse Blickensdorfer, to replace the first, in the hope that he could make the school profitable. He reduced the number of teachers to two, but this effort also failed and the seminary was closed in 1881. In later years the buildings were used for a normal school, and then finally torn down. All that remains of the school are elaborate iron gates on the western side of Main Street, given by alumnae of the school in memory of the nature walks led by the Rev. Holland in the Spring Woods, entered where the gates stand, and the name &quot;Seminary Street.&quot;

Hope retains many other signs of its past, and the entire downtown district is on the National Register of Historic Places, known as the Hope Historic District. The history of the town can also be traced in the town&#x27;s Yellow Trail Museum, which contains two floors of historical artifacts donated by the townspeople. The town is also home to the Rural Letter Carriers&#x27; Museum (currently undergoing removal and restoration), in honor of the fact that Hope has the oldest continuously-running rural mail delivery in the nation, begun in 1896.

Hope&#x27;s historic past is honored in Hope Heritage Days, held every year on the last full weekend in September.

Hope was one of Indiana&#x27;s smallest communities to still have its own newspaper, established in 1912 when two competing newspapers merged to create one weekly publication—the Hope Star-Journal. Upon the death of the editor in 2014, the Star-Journal converted to an online publication, at Home - HSJ Online.

Hope is home to three buildings designed by acclaimed architects: Hope Elementary (Taft Associates), Hope Branch Library (Deborah Berke), and Hope Star-Journal (Harry Weese). The latter was built as a branch of Irwin Union Bank.
==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Hope has a total area of , all land.

==Education and athletics==
Hope is home to Hauser Junior-Senior High School (grades 7-12). It is part of the Flatrock-Hawcreek School Corporation. The school mascot is the Jets, and school colors are black and white.

The school&#x27;s athletic teams have been very successful in recent years. In 2005, the boys&#x27; basketball team, coached by Bob Nobbe, were the Class A semi-state runners-up. In 2006, the boys&#x27; basketball team defeated Tri-Central to capture the Class A state championship. In 2005, the boys&#x27; baseball team were Class A state runners-up. The coach was Gerald Schoen. In 2015 the Lady Jets Softball team captured the Class A State Championship after defeating Carroll (Flora, Indiana) for the schools&#x27; first girls state championship. They were coached by Craig Sims.

Hope has a public library, a branch of the Bartholomew County Public Library.

==Culture==

The town of Hope has a strong sense of history, as reflected in its Yellow Trail Museum, its location as the site of the Haw Creek branch of the Bartholomew County Historical Society, its annual Heritage Days and Old-Fashioned Fourth of July, and a number of other traditional celebrations. The downtown Hope Historic District encompasses many nineteenth-century brick buildings and old houses, as well as one of Hope&#x27;s original log cabins. Adjacent to the current school is the historic Simmons School, a one-room schoolhouse in use from 1879-1907, where events and reenactments are now held.

The town has an Art Guild, a non-profit foundation housed at 645 Harrison Street, which promotes local art and artists. The town has also joined in the movement to display &quot;barn quilts,&quot; paintings of quilt squares on the sides of buildings, based originally on the hex squares, a type of Pennsylvania Dutch folk art traditionally painted to bring luck.

Hope has the only remaining Moravian church in the state of Indiana, and many of the traditional Moravian practices are also preserved, such as the display of the &quot;putz,&quot; or elaborate Christmas scene in miniature, in the church at Christmastime, the tradition of hanging Moravian stars, and the making of Moravian sugar cakes, a type of sweet raised coffee cake widely sold at local festivals.

A more recent Mennonite presence in Hope has brought traditional Mennonite foods to local stores. Combined with the area&#x27;s fresh produce and the Simmons Winery, an effort is being made to promote Hope as a center of good food traditions. A farmer&#x27;s market currently runs on the town square on Friday late afternoons, from June to September. In addition a variety of fresh produce is sold from yards, farmstands, or trucks, in true rural style.

Hope is also the center of the annual Hope Ride, a bicycling event that raises funds for charity. The Hope Ride takes place each year in September, when hundreds of cyclists converge on Hope to ride short or long country loops that take in a variety of scenic features such as historic barns, churches, bridges, monuments, and a local winery.

Hope also has a dinner theater, the Actors Studio of Hope, which puts on several productions per year in the Willow Leaves venue on the town square.

Groundhog Day (February 2) is celebrated in Hope on the town square with local dignitaries in costume viewing the prediction of a local groundhog, currently Hope the Groundhog, or her brother Frank, from the local Utopia Wildlife Rehabilitators.

Hope&#x27;s supporters and organizations such as Main Street of Hope have been vigorous in attracting business to the town, despite its small size. In addition to the usual amenities, town businesses include a pizza place, a Mexican restaurant, a cafe, an antique shop with a lunchroom, which also hosts the dinner theater, a salon, a funeral home, a dental office, a chiropractor, a library, two parks, a bank, a pharmacy, a hardware store and gas stations with convenience stores.

Author Philip Gulley&#x27;s novel &quot;A Place Called Hope&quot; (Center Street/Hachette, 2014) is set in Hope, Indiana, and concerns a pastor who moves to Hope to take over a Quaker congregation. Although the town in the book is called Hope, Indiana, it does not greatly resemble the real Hope and there is no Quaker congregation in the real Hope.

==Cemeteries==

===Moravian Cemetery===
The Moravian Cemetery has a historic section with 1,070 graves that were organized by the choir system, separating the graves by gender and marital status. This tradition follows the custom in Hernnhut, Germany, where Moravians found sanctuary from religious persecution. The grave markers are often flat slabs because Moravians believe in equality after death. Some graves have a flat slab and a footer area for flowers, a mixture between a box tomb and a cradle, that is unique to this cemetery.

<text>Ambia is a town in Hickory Grove Township, Benton County, Indiana, United States. The population was 239 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Lafayette, Indiana Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Ambia was laid out by Ezekiel M. Talbot and his wife Marietta on February 22, 1875, and named for their daughter Ambia Talbot. (The couple had two years earlier planned the nearby town of Talbot.) Its first building was a house erected by James C. Pugh which was soon joined by a grain elevator, general store and blacksmith. A drug store, hardware store, hotel, physician and a variety of other establishments followed.

Ambia was a stop on the Lafayette, Muncie and Bloomington Railroad (later the Lake Erie and Western) which ran between Lafayette and Hoopeston. The Wabash Railway Company, which built a stretch of the LM&amp;B through Illinois, originally wanted to construct a railway switch at a site known as Weaver City, a small town just west of Ambia in Vermilion County, Illinois; the owner of the property, however, refused to grant land for it. In response, the railway officials sent a force of men without notice to move the station house from Weaver City half a mile east across the state border, which they did on the Sunday morning of March 10, 1873. The town&#x27;s businesses and residents followed and Weaver City faded from existence while Ambia sprang up near the station&#x27;s new site.

==Geography==
Ambia is located in the extreme southwest corner of the county, in Hickory Grove Township. The Kankakee, Beaverville and Southern Railroad and Indiana State Road 352 pass through the town, and the upper end of the North Fork of the Vermilion River flows past one mile to the north.

According to the 2010 census, Ambia has a total area of , all land.

<text>Fowler is a town in, and county seat of Center Township, Benton County, Indiana, United States. The population was 2,337 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Lafayette, Indiana Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
Fowler was platted by husband and wife Moses and Eliza Fowler on October 26, 1872, and originally consisted of 583 lots, though a re-platting on April 8, 1875, expanded it to 1,602 lots and 20 blocks. Several more additions were made to the town over subsequent years.

The town&#x27;s first home was erected in March 1871 by Scott Shipman, and its first business opened in June of that year, a small general store run by Henry D. Clark. Many more businesses followed over the next few years, including the Henry Jacobs &amp; Son grocery, grain elevators built by L. Templeton, and blacksmith John E.

<text>Otterbein is a town in Shelby Township, Tippecanoe County and Bolivar Township, Benton County, Indiana, named for William Otterbein Brown who donated land for the town. As of the 2020 census, its population was 1,144.

It is part of the Lafayette, Indiana Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Originally a site known as Pond Grove, Otterbein&#x27;s first 60 lots were laid out by John Levering and his wife on October 25, 1872, with an addition by Mary A. Clancey on April 24, 1883. The first home was built by Dr. John K. Thompson and the first business, a general store, by Henry H. Moore. William Otterbein Brown, the farmer and stock-dealer for whom the town was named, held the office of postmaster until his death on February 18, 1879. Otterbein High School ran from 1910 to 1966, when the consolidated Benton Community School Corporation came into existence. The gym and most of the building burned in a fire in 1975.

As of 2023, Otterbein has two churches, Catholic and United Methodist, 4 restaurants, 2 sporting goods stores, a thrift shop, an elementary school, and a public library.

At one time, two sets of Nickel Plate Railroad tracks ran through the town. One set of tracks has since been removed, and the other is used by Kankakee, Beaverville and Southern Railroad. Since the end of 2008, the railroad right-of-way has been used for the placement of poles that carry electric power from the wind turbines in western Benton County to the substation at Montmorenci.

Kerkhoff Truss Plant and Rowe Trucking Inc occupy the industrial park at the east edge of town, which is actually in Tippecanoe County. The Otterbein post office has been in operation since 1872.

==Geography==
Otterbein occupies mostly flat, open farm land on the eastern border of Benton County in Bolivar Township, with eastern sections of the community extending into Tippecanoe County. U.S. Route 52 passes along its north side and the Kankakee, Beaverville and Southern Railroad cuts through town to the south.

According to the 2010 census, Otterbein has a total area of , all land.

Oxford Street, old US 52, is the central east-west street and the only blinking traffic light in town is located at its junction with Main Street. Otterbein is known for its extremely wide, block-long Main Street that accommodates two rows of parallel parking in the middle of the street.

<text>Oxford is a town in Oak Grove Township, Benton County, Indiana. The population was 1,162 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Lafayette, Indiana, Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Oxford was Benton County&#x27;s first town. Commissioners appointed by the Indiana General Assembly selected the location in May 1843 to be the site of the county seat on land donated by Henry W. Ellsworth and David Atkinson. It was first called Milroy in honor of Samuel Milroy, one of the commissioners, but a town in Rush County already bore that name. In October 1843 the commissioners changed it to Hartford, after Hartford, Connecticut (the home of Ellsworth and Watkins), but they discovered this name was also already being used in Indiana, so in December Judge David J. McConnell awarded the town its present name.
Lots went up for sale at this time, with buyers allowed to pay for the lots in three installments over 18 months. The first building erected in Oxford was a two-story, wooden frame courthouse, designed and built by Francis Boynton, and the second was a hotel, built by Henry L. Ellsworth and operated by James L. Hatton. The first home was that of Aaron Wood, who also ran a small store that supplied groceries, beer and whiskey.

Other early establishments in Oxford included the Earl &amp; Carnahan dry goods store and Barnes &amp; Dailey drug store. The town&#x27;s first lawyer was Jacob Benedict and its first physician Dr. Mayo. An 1883 history also makes mention of the community&#x27;s first literary society, the Oxford Lyceum.

Many additions and expansions to the town were made over subsequent decades, adding several streets and more than 300 lots. On July 7, 1869, a vote was held to determine if Oxford should be incorporated, and passed with 41 in favor and 28 against. The town was dealt a blow, however, when in 1874 it lost its status as county seat to more centrally-located Fowler, 9 miles to the north.

Standardbred horse Dan Patch is arguably the town&#x27;s best-known native, and was foaled in an Oxford barn on April 29, 1896. The horse gained celebrity status for setting world speed records that remained unbroken until 1960. A 1949 film, &quot;The Great Dan Patch&quot;, dramatized the horse&#x27;s origins in Oxford and rise to fame. He continues to be honored at the town&#x27;s annual Dan Patch Days festival.

The David S. Heath House and Presbyterian Church Building are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Additional significant historic properties include the Messner Building and the Masonic Building.

==Geography==
Oxford is located in Oak Grove Township in the south part of the county. U.S. Route 52 passes within two miles of the town to the northeast; State Road 352 passes through the town and connects with US 52. State Road 55 also passes through downtown Oxford. The area occupied by the town is mostly open farmland that slopes gently southeast toward Big Pine Creek.

According to the 2010 census, Oxford has a total area of , all land.

<text>Dunkirk is a city in Blackford and Jay counties in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 2,164 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Dunkirk was originally called Quincy, and under the latter name was platted in 1853. When the first post office was established there, it was discovered there was already a Quincy, Indiana, and so the town was renamed Dunkirk to avoid repetition.

The Dunkirk Post Office contains a mural, &quot;Preparations for Autumn Festival, Dunkirk&quot;, painted in 1941 by Frances Foy. Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department.

Dunkirk, referred as the Glass Capitol of Indiana, was once home to 23 glass factories, some no larger than a house. With the closure of Indiana Glass Company, only one glass factory remains. It produces approximately 2,500,000 beer bottles per day for Budweiser. The factory is an ultra-computerized modern facility employing 400 employees. Dunkirk also houses an extensive Glass Museum with glass manufactured worldwide. An annual Feel The Warmth downtown city event and a Mainstreet USA Festival. It also has a large 4 July Fireworks Display and Annual Event held at the large City Park.

Dunkirk is also home to one of the largest city parks in Jay County as well as a downtown Depot Park with Summer Concerts and Weekend Farmer Markets. The large Municipal provides 2 baseball fields, 1 large enclosed shelter house and a small open shelter building, various children related playground equipment, a basketball court, a large modern community center and a community swimming pool.

<text>Hartford City is a city in the U.S. state of Indiana, and the county seat of Blackford County. Located in the northeast central portion of the state, the small farming community underwent a dramatic 15-year economic boom beginning in the late 1880s. The Indiana Gas Boom resulted from the discovery and exploitation of natural gas in the area. The rural economy was transformed to one that included manufacturing. The boom attracted workers and residents, retail establishments, and craftspeople. The increased population was a catalyst for the construction of roads, schools, and churches. After the boom came a long period of growth and stability. Agriculture (and agricultural trade) remained as the basis for the economy.

From the 1920s through the 1970s, Hartford City continued to thrive. Agricultural automation and consolidation of small farms into industrial-size farms resulted in a decline in the population; the small farmer became unable to compete and fewer laborers were needed. Some workers turned to the manufacturing and construction sectors for employment in nearby cities. However, manufacturing hubs such as Muncie and Marion suffered the collapse of their economies during industrial restructuring when large factories closed. Despite the decline, Hartford City was able to retain the paper company, 3M.

The city government has concentrated on bringing manufacturing to Hartford City and has had some success in securing state funding for businesses that use recycled or agricultural materials in the manufacturing process. Younger people leave to attend college and pursue professional careers outside the scope of those available in Hartford City. Community college, private colleges, and a university are within commuting distance; however, Hartford City lacks rental housing appropriate to college students or young adults. The town&#x27;s population was 6,086 in the 2020 United States Census, down from 6,220 in the 2010 United States Census.

==Early history==

Hartford City, Indiana began in the late 1830s as a few log cabins clustered near a creek. Folklore taught in local elementary schools suggests that Hartford City was originally known as &quot;Hart&#x27;s ford,&quot; a place to cross Lick Creek. The name evolved to Hartford, and eventually to Hartford City. (This was to avoid confusion with another Hartford in the state.)

The community was designated as the county seat of Blackford County when that county was created in 1837, and it was incorporated in 1867. During the last half of the 19th century, East Central Indiana consisted mostly of rural farming communities, including Hartford City. The town&#x27;s population did not exceed 2,000 until after 1887, when the region began to grow because of the Indiana Gas Boom.

Hartford City&#x27;s population tripled in the next decade, as manufacturers were lured to the region to take advantage of low costs for land and the natural gas. Hartford City benefited from railroad service from two railroads in addition to a natural gas supply that was thought to be unlimited. Manufacturers such as Hartford City Glass Company, Sneath Glass Company, Hartford City Paper, Utility Paper, and Willman Lumber all located or began in Hartford City during the 1890s. Although the supply of natural gas was soon exhausted, many of these businesses continued to operate into the 1950s and beyond. Hartford City leaders attracted businesses such as Overhead Door (1923) and 3M (1955) to replace the glass factories as major employers in the city.

==Geography==
Hartford City sits on top of former natural gas fields. The area also has limestone formed from silt and mud deposits of an ancient sea. The land is flat from the effect of a prehistoric glacier, and the soil is excellent for farming.

For every 100 females, there were 89.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 85.4 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $31,531, and the median income for a family was $39,654. Males had a median income of $29,257 versus $20,600 for females. The per capita income for the city was $15,596. About 7.3% of families and 10.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 15.8% of those under age 18 and 7.7% of those age 65 or over.

==Economy==

About 11 percent of Hartford City&#x27;s male workers, and 9 percent of female workers, are employed in the transportation equipment industry. This makes the transportation equipment industry the most important provider of jobs for the city, although there are no auto parts plants located in the county. The decline of the auto industry has forced Hartford City to be less of a &quot;bedroom community&quot; reliant on jobs relating to automobile parts manufacturing in nearby cities, and more focused on developing businesses within the city. Currently, there are six businesses located in Hartford City that employ between 100 and 350 people, and none with more than 350 employees. Those six companies (in descending order of employees) are 3M Company, Petoskey Plastic, BRC Rubber Group, Inc., Blackford Community Hospital, and New Indy Paper Mill. In addition, there are nearly twenty more local entities with 25 to 100 employees. Agriculture also influences the town. Although they do not live in the city limits, farm families are involved with the local schools, parks, and social activities – and are consumers of the products of local merchants.

==Culture==
The 2009 official web site of Hartford City shows three main pictures: Civil War re-enactors, a basketball player, and the courthouse, illustrating what is important to the city and its culture. Hartford City&#x27;s town square is a &quot;living museum&quot;, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Hartford City Courthouse Square Historic District. Many of the buildings were built during the gas boom in the late 19th century, and are examples of architectural styles used at that time, including Romanesque Revival, Commercial Italianate, Renaissance Revival, and Queen Anne. The Blackford County Courthouse and First Presbyterian Church are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Adding to the historical atmosphere, the courthouse lawn contains war monuments on each corner. The town has a small museum and library housed in the Blackford County Historical Society building. The city&#x27;s main public library, the Hartford City Public Library, is a Carnegie library that began with funding from Andrew Carnegie in 1903.

===Recreation===
Sports and recreation are important to the community. The city Parks Department maintains four parks and a public swimming pool. There are four golf courses within from Hartford City, and ten more are within . The city has some small lakes and reservoirs available for fishing, such as Lake Placid and the lakes of the nearby Shamrock Lakes area. A larger lake (over ) is (Salamonie Lake), with boating, fishing, and swimming, is located 29 miles (47 km) northwest of Hartford City. State Parks nearby include Ouabache, Mounds, and Summit Lake. For those willing to drive north for about 90 minutes, Pokagon State Park is located on Lake James and Snow Lake. This park features campgrounds, hiking trails, a beach, the Potawatomi Inn, and a toboggan track.

Hartford City sports leagues include baseball, softball, soccer, and football. Indiana is known for its high school basketball, and Hartford City high schools have had their share of success in the state basketball tournament. Hartford City High School won 14 sectional and 3 regional tournaments in about 60 years of action. Hartford City High was consolidated into Blackford High School in 1969, and Blackford has won 10 sectionals. The Blackford High School gym seats 4,000 for a town with a population of less than 7,000. Hartford City&#x27;s Blackford High School football team has also had some tournament success, winning the Indiana state 2A football championship in 1974-75 and 1979-80 – both teams were undefeated.

===Agriculture===
Agriculture has a strong influence on Hartford City&#x27;s culture. The main crops in the area are soybeans and corn. Some wheat and hay are also grown. The Indiana Farm Bureau office for Blackford County is located in Hartford City. 4-H, a youth organization associated with the U.S. Department of Agriculture has a strong presence. The annual county 4-H fair is held in June, and features a rodeo, horse show, dog show, livestock, and carnival. The week-long event includes a mile-long parade with a marching band.

== Government ==

The government consists of a mayor and a city council. The mayor is elected in citywide vote. The city council consists of five members with four elected from individual districts and one elected at-large. The current members of city council are:
* Tony Scaggs (R, AL)

* Michael Wolfe (R, 1st)
* Dustin George (R, 2nd)
* Ron Parrott (R, 3rd)
* Ron Dudelston (R, 4th)

==Religion==

The United Methodist Church is the city&#x27;s largest congregation; other churches include Catholic, Church of the Nazarene, Christian, Lutheran, Wesleyan, Baptist, and Presbyterian. The Methodists, and then the Presbyterians, were the first to build churches in town. The First Presbyterian Church and the Christian Church buildings were built during the Gas Boom in the 1890s.

==Media==

The local daily (except Sunday) newspaper is the News Times, and it is also available from its web site. Hartford City has a history of difficulty supporting two newspapers, and the News Times can trace its lineage back to the Hartford City News and the Hartford City Times. During the Gas Boom, the town had two weekly and two daily newspapers: Hartford City Telegram, The Hartford City Times, Hartford City Evening News, and The Daily Times.

There are at least fourteen radio stations that send moderate to very strong signals to the Hartford City area. These stations are typically located nearby, or they have an exceptional signal, such as Fort Wayne&#x27;s 50,000 watt WOWO AM station. The two local radio stations are WMXQ and WHCI, both FM stations.

Indianapolis television stations such as WTTV, WRTV, WISH-TV, WTHR, and others, reach the antennas of households in Hartford City. Stations located near Hartford City include Tipton&#x27;s WJSJ-CD, Marion&#x27;s WSOT-LD, and Muncie&#x27;s WIPB.

==Education==
The state of Indiana has many college options available, including well-known universities such as Ball State University, Indiana University, Purdue, and Notre Dame. The state also has one of the largest private boarding high schools, the Culver Academies.

===Higher education===
Hartford City has at least four universities located within of town. Ball State University is the largest and most well known, and is about away in Muncie, Indiana. (Ball State is named for the Ball brothers, who made much of their fortune with the Ball Corporation in the same Indiana Gas Boom that boosted Hartford City.) Muncie is also home to Ivy Tech State College-East Central. Private school Indiana Wesleyan University is about away, in Marion, Indiana. Another private school, Taylor University, is about away in Upland. Its location in Upland dates from 1893, attributed to the population boom in the area at the time, and is another example of the impact of the Indiana Gas Boom.

===Primary and secondary schools===
 Blackford High School is located on the north side of Hartford City, and it has served the entire county since 1969. Enrollment for the 2008-2009 school year is 702 students, and 41 teachers are listed on the school roster. Hartford City High School was the town&#x27;s high school prior to the 1969 consolidation of Montpelier High School. Hartford City Middle School is located on the town&#x27;s west side, within easy walking distance from Sigma Phi Gamma Park. Students from grades 6 through 8 attend the middle school, and 23 teachers are listed on the roster. Students for grades 3 through 5 attend Northside Elementary School, and grades K through 4 attend Southside Elementary School. Hartford City also has a private school – Saint John&#x27;s Riedman Memorial School is a private Catholic elementary school with approximately 60 students.

==Transportation==

Hartford City&#x27;s early transportation advantage came from the two railroad lines that crossed in the city, running north-south and east-west. The east-west line is now out of service as of 2008, but the north-south line is still in service. Both are operated by Norfolk Southern. Hartford City also has a good highway system. Indiana State Road 3 runs north-south through the city, known as Walnut Street. Indiana State Road 26 runs east-west through the city, known as Washington Street. Indiana State Road 22 used to run concurrently with State Road 26 through Hartford City, but that segment was decommissioned in the 1970s. Although Interstate 69 does not run through Hartford City or Blackford County, it is less than away and a convenient way to drive to Fort Wayne or Indianapolis. From Hartford City, drive west on State Road 26 to reach Interstate 69. Driving north from Indianapolis, the State Road 26 exit is number 255. The Interstate&#x27;s northbound exit 259, at Upland, is an easy route to travel to the north side of Hartford City. Some small airports are located near Hartford City, and larger airports in Fort Wayne and Indianapolis offer commercial flights.

<text>Montpelier is a city in Harrison Township, Blackford County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. This small rural community, the county&#x27;s first to be platted, was established by settlers from Vermont, and is named after Vermont&#x27;s capital city of Montpelier.

Montpelier was a central participant in the Indiana Gas Boom, as natural gas was discovered near the community in 1887. More importantly, the county&#x27;s first successful oil well was drilled on the south side of Montpelier in 1890. Its population quickly grew from 808 in 1890 to about 6,500 by 1896. The Gas Boom, mostly an oil boom for Montpelier, gradually ended during the first decade of the 20th century.

Like many boom towns, the city&#x27;s population has never matched that of the boom years. The city&#x27;s population was 1,805 at the 2010 census. However, the city&#x27;s population stabilized many decades ago, and the community has multiple industries and an active community association. Montpelier is located near the former Godfroy Indian Reservation, and a statue of an Indian is featured prominently in the downtown district.

==History==
In 1836 and 1837, several groups of settlers from Vermont moved to East Central Indiana, and settled on the high ground on the south side of the Salamonie River. Abel Baldwin, a veteran of the War of 1812, was the leader of this group of Vermont natives. They named their community Montpelier, after the capital of their original home state. Baldwin and his son-in-law, civil engineer John Cook, surveyed the area in 1836, and it was platted on September 5, 1837. The original plat had 16 blocks with a total of 154 lots.

At the time Montpelier was settled, it was part of Jay County. The western portion of Jay County was split away in 1838 to form Blackford County. Montpelier was not the first community in what would become Blackford County – a village named Matamoras existed earlier. However, Montpelier was platted first, and Matamoras was essentially a ghost town after the 1880s.

Beginning in September 1870, the Fort Wayne, Cincinnati &amp; Louisville Railroad connected Fort Wayne with Muncie, Indiana, and Montpelier was (and still is) on this line. With dramatically improved transportation for the community, Montpelier became incorporated as a town at the end of 1870. By that time, the town had grown to a population of 231.

===Gas Boom===
In 1887, natural gas was discovered in Blackford County, and the area began its participation in the Indiana Gas Boom. While natural gas was found throughout Blackford County, crude oil was found mostly in the county&#x27;s Harrison Township, which includes Montpelier. Blackford County&#x27;s first successful oil well, located just south of Montpelier, began producing during 1890. Montpelier was thought to be &quot;the very heart of the greatest natural gas and oil field in the world&quot;. By the mid-1890s, about two-thirds of Harrison Township (25 square miles) was considered part of an oil-producing region. Montpelier became a city where “money and whiskey flowed frequently”, and numerous other “recreational activities” were available. Oil production from the Trenton Gas and Oil Field surrounding Montpelier began decreasing during the first decade of the 20th century, and the Gas Boom (or Montpelier&#x27;s oil boom) gradually came to an end. Montpelier began a return to normalcy and its population (like many boom towns) has never exceeded its Gas Boom peak.

===Dillinger===
The Montpelier National Bank was robbed by three men on the afternoon of August 4, 1933. The robbery lasted about ten minutes, and no shooting was involved. The robbers quietly left town, driving east on Indiana State Road 18, without being followed. It was later determined, by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, that the robbers were John Dillinger and the Dillinger Gang.

==Geography==
Montpelier is part of East Central Indiana and Northern Indiana. Future Northern Indiana, including what became Harrison Township and Montpelier, was flattened by two glaciers millions of years ago. These glaciers are also responsible for the rich Blackford County farmland, which includes the land surrounding Montpelier.

Located in the Harrison Township portion of Blackford County, Indiana, Montpelier is adjacent to the Salamonie River. It is located south of Fort Wayne, Indiana, and northeast of Indianapolis.

According to the 2010 census, Montpelier has a total area of , all land.

The city also has some manufacturing establishments, and its major businesses provide employment for over 400 people. These businesses include Emhart-Gripco, Smith Consulting, Indiana Veneer, BRC Rubber &amp; Plastics, Indiana Box, and others. Montpelier also has a 50-acre industrial park.

==Culture==
 Montpelier has a long history of racing. During the 19th century, there were at least two race tracks for horses near Montpelier. Montpelier&#x27;s own horse track was established in 1903. This track was very popular and drew crowds of 3,000. During the 1920s, a rebuilt track became known as the fastest half mile in Indiana. During the 1950s, the track became a stock car racing track, but reverted to horses in the 1960s. The track closed in 1973, but reopened in 1985 for stock car races and horse racing. Today, Montpelier Raceway features sanctioned stock car racing.

The Public Library of Montpelier and Harrison Township was built in 1907 and 1908. The building was made possible by a donation of $10,000 from philanthropist (and former business magnate) Andrew Carnegie. Built in the Classical Revival style of architecture, this building (under the historical name of Montpelier Carnegie Library) was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. It is one of only three individual buildings in Blackford County listed in the National Register. (The county also has a Historic District.)

Montpelier&#x27;s First Baptist Church was founded by Franklin Baldwin, brother of the leader of Montpelier&#x27;s first settlers, Abel Baldwin. The congregation was organized in 1838. The present church building, located in downtown Montpelier, was constructed in 1907 and 1908. The building has been remodeled since that time.

High school basketball is very popular in Indiana, and Montpelier has been a strong participant. Despite its smaller size, Montpelier High School won five sectional basketball tournament championships. After a high school consolidation, Montpelier students began attending Blackford High School – and Blackford has won ten sectional championships. Additional sporting activities in Montpelier include Little League baseball, Tee Ball, and softball. Golfing, camping, and fishing are also available nearby.

The Montpelier Jamboree is an annual celebration that was first held in 1945. This Labor Day weekend celebration features musical acts, a Jamboree Queen contest, and other activities.

===Miami Indians===

The former Godfroy Reservation, an Indian reservation for Chief Francis Godfroy and Miami Indians from 1827 until 1836, is located on the Salamonie River near Montpelier. (Francis is the English pronunciation of Godfroy&#x27;s real name François. The Indian pronunciation of François was Palonzwa.) Godfroy&#x27;s father was French, and his mother was from the Miami tribe. A big man at six feet tall and 300 pounds, Godfroy was the last war chief of the Miami Nation. A sculpture of a Plains Indian stands in downtown Montpelier, donated by Chief Larry Godfroy. The sculpture was seen in the introductory montage on the television program &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;. The “Ice Cream Giant” at the former Point Restaurant north of Montpelier was also featured in this clip.

==Politics==

Up until recently, Montpelier was much more Democratic than Blackford County as a whole. It shifted strongly towards the Republican Party in the 2016 United States presidential election. The mayor, Brad Neff, is a Republican.

==Infrastructure==
Montpelier had its own elementary school (closing in 2022), and high school students attend the county&#x27;s Blackford High School. Five universities, including Ball State University and Taylor University, are located not more than from Montpelier.

The Norfolk Southern Railway provides freight railroad service connecting Montpelier to Fort Wayne and Indianapolis. This railroad, known as the Lake Erie and Western Railroad in the 1890s during the Gas Boom, was very important for the growth of Montpelier. Indiana Highway 18 runs through Montpelier, and Interstate 69 is west. The nearest airport with commercial flights is located north in Fort Wayne.

A master planned, mixed-use development named for U.S. Army officer and Boone County native Anson Mills was established in this area in 2005. The Great Recession adversely impacted the Anson project&#x27;s original construction schedule, but residential, retail, and commercial growth gained momentum starting in 2011 and continues to this day. The Anson development now features a large selection of retail, including superstores and several fashion and lifestyle stores.

<text>Nashville is a town in Washington Township, Brown County, Indiana, United States. The population was 1,256 at the 2020 census. The town is the county seat of Brown County and is the county&#x27;s only incorporated town. The town is best known as the center of the Brown County Art Colony and as a tourist destination.

== History ==
Settlement of land in and around Nashville began with the acquisition of land from native populations under the 1809 Treaty of Fort Wayne. This was expanded with more acquisitions under the 1818 Treaty of St. Mary&#x27;s. Founded in 1836 by county agent Banner C. Brummett, it was first named Jacksonburg. The population of the entire county was estimated to be 150 in 1830. The first Nashville courthouse was constructed in 1837 and a jail was added in the same year. By 1840, area population had grown to 2,364. The town was officially incorporated in 1872. By the turn of the century, heavy logging in the area had caused significant deforestation which resulted in dramatic erosion problems.
In the early twentieth century, a number of artists settled in the area, most notably T. C. Steele, the American Impressionist painter. These artists were the basis for the Brown County Art Colony, which continues to this day as the Brown County Art Guild.

The Brown County Courthouse Historic District and F.P. Taggart Store are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Nashville has a total area of , all land.

Nashville&#x27;s rolling hills, ridges, and valleys are a story of the north fork of Salt Creek. The surrounding hills are made of sandstone, siltstone and shale. These sedimentary rocks were laid down in an ancient river delta named the Borden delta, similar to the current Mississippi River delta.
Salt Creek (south), Greasy Creek (east), and Jackson Branch Creek (west) have cut down through the surrounding terrain to give Nashville its rolling hills. Lake Monroe, the largest lake in Indiana, was constructed by damming Salt Creek south of Bloomington.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Nashville has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Borden is a town in Wood Township, Clark County, Indiana, United States. The population was 786 at the 2020 census. The town&#x27;s official name was New Providence until December 29, 1994.

==History==
The town was founded in 1816 by Rhode Islander John Borden and was originally named New Providence, after the Rhode Island capital of Providence. William W. Borden (1823–1906), son of John Borden, was a scholar, philanthropist and distinguished citizen of New Providence and earned his wealth in the Leadville, Colorado, silver mines, becoming one of Clark County&#x27;s wealthiest citizens.

In 1884, the Borden Institute was founded by William W. Borden as a college for teacher preparation and laboratory-based scientific studies. He also established within the town a library and a museum with an extensive geological collection that later became an important and valuable collection in Chicago&#x27;s Field Museum following his death. His final crown jewel within the community was his elaborate family mansion situated on a hill overlooking the town. The town honored William W. Borden by unofficially renaming the town and post office Borden because of his generosity and influence within the community his father founded. The Borden Institute closed in 1906 and around 1910 became used as William W. Borden High School, or simply Borden High School. The Institute served this purpose until 1955 when a new elementary and Jr-Sr High School were built adjacent to the Institute. The museum still stands and houses some of the original books from the Borden Library and is currently used as a community center. The Borden Mansion also still stands and has been occupied by the Emil Stark family since the early 1970s. Following its use as a high school, the Borden Institute fell into disrepair and was razed in 1983 even after a decade long effort by citizens to preserve it.

Borden is served by the CSX (formally Monon) rail system and was once one of the main loading points for carloads of strawberries shipped by The Borden-Pekin Berry Growers Association north along the Monon Rail. The large volume of strawberries supplied by the area farmers influenced the naming of the athletic teams at Borden High School. The teams were nicknamed the Borden Berries in 1934 and the name was used until 1966 when it was changed by the student body to the Borden Braves. Strawberries continue to be farmed in the Borden area, especially in nearby Starlight, Indiana where the Starlight Strawberry Festival is held each Memorial Day weekend.

A well known establishment in Borden is Brewer&#x27;s General Store. This family owned store was opened by John Brewer in 1931 and was owned and managed by the extended Brewer family until its closing in 2012. Due to Borden&#x27;s rural setting, Brewer&#x27;s took pride in marketing itself as a provider of goods in the scenic &quot;Hillbilly&quot; Valley. Favorites of the store included a large wheel of Wisconsin Rat Trap Cheese, Amish hard candies and Hillbilly Popsickles (large dill pickles served on a wooden stick).

Another popular establishment was George McKinley &amp; Son Hardware Feed Store on Highway 60. McKinley had traded roughly 100 acres on Martinsburg Knob for the store in the 1920s. The pot-belly stove in the center of the store served as a gathering place for community checker matches. A 5&#x27; X 10&#x27; display window highlighted seasonal goods and was kept up-to-date by granddaughters Joyce (Money) and Marilyn (Riley). The store also provided the community with fuel with its Shell service station. Now there is a Dollar General Store parking lot on that site.
In the 1960s, several dams were constructed along the tributaries leading to Muddy Fork, which runs through the town. This helped keep Borden from being flooded during heavy rains. On April 3, 1974, an F5 tornado struck the west side of Borden before moving into nearby Daisy Hill, killing one person. On May 27, 2004, an F2 tornado struck the northern edge of the town, doing damage to homes and the trees on the hillside but causing no deaths. On March 2, 2012, an EF4 tornado, hit nearby Pekin and the northern Borden community of Daisy Hill before moving along to Henryville and points further northeast. This tornado did extensive damage to these areas and was responsible for deaths in Pekin, Henryville, and other Indiana towns and counties.

In the early 2000s, William W. Borden High School underwent an expansion project and a new building was built in place of the school parking lot. A new parking lot was then built at the old Borden Park. With the help of donations from the community and the generosity of the Koetter Family of Starlight, the town then built a new Borden Community Park on the East end of Borden near the former Kimball International plant, along Muddy Fork. It includes basketball and tennis courts, a soccer field, a little league baseball complex, a walking path along the fork, and a war memorial for local residents who served in the military. The Borden Valley Day Festival is held in the park annually on the second Saturday in June.

In 2013, Borden High School won its first semi-state and state championships. The Braves beat University in the Semi-State round 47–44 in front of a standing room-only crowd in nearby Seymour, Indiana. On March 23, 2013, the Borden Braves came into Bankers Life Fieldhouse and won their first state championship 55–50. After this state championship run, there was a video made about the Borden Braves titled How &#x27;Bout Them Braves which was the rallying cry of the Borden faithful during the run.

Norman M. Coats of Kirkwood, Missouri has written a book called &quot;Growing Up on Daisy Hill&quot;, which chronicles his early years being born and raised in the nearby hills and hollows of Borden during the Great Depression. Borden is also the former home of ten-time ARCA champion Frank Kimmel.

<text>Charlestown is a city located within Charlestown Township, in Clark County, Indiana, United States. The population was 7,775 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Charlestown was established in 1808, named after one of its surveyors, Charles Beggs, upon , of which was designated for a town square. It was established one mile (1.6 km) northeast of Springville, and was responsible for Springville&#x27;s demise.

Milling was important to the town, as the first mill was built in the area, on Fourteen Mile Creek, in 1804. This mill would be abandoned when John Work built a mill by use of a tunnel in 1814. Today, that mill is part of the Tunnel Mill Scout Reservation.

From 1811 to 1878 Charlestown was the county seat of Clark County, but as Jeffersonville had surpassed it economically, the county seat reverted to Jeffersonville in 1878.

In 1818, the first Grand Lodge of Free &amp; Accepted Masons in Indiana met in Charlestown, due to Jonathan Jennings&#x27; influence.

In 1940 the population of Charlestown was 900, but it swelled to 13,400 due to the building and operation of the Indiana Army Ammunition Plant (INAAP). This created a housing problem, as chicken, wood, and wash houses had to house all the new residents who flocked to the area for the jobs created by the INAAP. Additional problems caused by the rapid influx of new residents were improper sanitation at restaurants, inefficient sewers, gambling, panhandling, and diseases such as typhoid and malaria.

In 2014, the city announced they would be applying for a grant to redevelop Pleasant Ridge Subdivision, an impoverished area within the city. Some residents of the Pleasant Ridge Subdivision formed an association to fight against demolishing their homes via eminent domain. The City Council did not call for a vote on the issue and the grant issue failed. Starting in 2016, the city was accused of using excessive fines against homeowners in the subdivision in order to force them to sell to a private developer.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Charlestown has a total area of , of which (or 99.66%) is land and (or 0.34%) is water.

<text>Clarksville is a town in Clark County, Indiana, United States, along the Ohio River and is a part of the Louisville Metropolitan area. The population was 22,333 at the 2020 census. The town was founded in 1783 by early resident George Rogers Clark at the only seasonal rapids on the entire Ohio River, it is the oldest American town in the former Northwest Territory. The town is home to the Colgate clock, one of the largest clocks in the world and the Falls of the Ohio State Park, home to the world&#x27;s largest exposed Devonian period fossil bed.

==History==

The site that would become Clarksville was first used as a base of operations by George Rogers Clark during the American Revolutionary War. In 1778 he established a post on an island at the head of the Falls of the Ohio, from which he trained his 175-man regiment. After the war, Clark was granted a tract of for his services in the war. In 1783, were set aside for the development of a town, Clarksville. The same year a stockade was built and settlement began.

The explorer William Clark was a younger brother of George Rogers Clark. Historian Stephen Ambrose writes of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark in &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot;, &quot;When they shook hands [at Clarksville], the Lewis and Clark Expedition began.&quot; A two-figure statue near the falls commemorates the expedition. Several localities other than Clarksville claim precedence for the start of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, most notably St. Louis, Missouri.

Due to the many floods in the nineteenth century and the Indiana Canal Company&#x27;s failed competition to build a canal around the Ohio Falls, the town struggled. On August 24, 1805, the Indiana Territorial Legislature authorized the construction of a canal around the Falls of the Ohio at Clarksville. The first attempt failed and the investors lost their money. Historians believe it was used to finance the conspiracy of Aaron Burr. Developers tried to build a canal in 1817 and again in 1820. But the race to build the canal was lost in 1826 when the federal government made a large grant to build the Louisville and Portland Canal. The lack of a canal handicapped the growth of the town as the Falls of the Ohio made river transport from the city difficult.

Clarksville became a popular dueling spot for Kentuckians who wanted to dodge their home state&#x27;s anti-dueling laws. The most famous of these was the 1809 duel between Henry Clay and Humphrey Marshall. There was an attempt to build a second town within Clarksville&#x27;s boundaries, named Ohio Falls City, until the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that this would be illegal.
The town was managed by a ten-member Board of Trustees in the charter from Virginia. The trustees were allowed to align lots along roads and sell the lots for the proceeds to benefit the town. The trustees could elect replacements as needed and did not have to reside in the town. This remained controversial with residents until 1889 when the board stopped meeting and was replaced by a three-member board. One member was selected by the Floyd County Commissioners, one by the Clark County Commissioners, and one by residents of Clarksville. Between 1889 and 1937, the town established a five-member board entirely elected by residents. The historic records related to this governmental change were lost in the Ohio River flood of 1937.

The Great Flood of 1937 decimated the town. The entire town was submerged beneath as much as of water in some areas for over three weeks during January and February. With almost all of the old town destroyed, Clarksville was rebuilt with a new modern city plan.

The post-World War II housing boom and new jobs brought growth to the city. The population increased from 2,400 in 1940 to 22,000 in 2000. The city has expanded to the north by annexing several sizable suburbs. By 1981 the State of Indiana changed statutes to convert the managing board of trustees to a council with members rather than trustees. In 1990 voters approved expansion of members of the Town Council from five to seven following the area growth. Clarksville is now the major shopping hub of Southern Indiana, with the hub area centered on Lewis and Clark Parkway and nearby Veterans Parkway.

==Attractions==

Clarksville has the largest exposed fossil beds from the Devonian period. This area has now been incorporated in the Falls of the Ohio State Park, where the state has built an education center. The fossils include plant and marine life from a prehistoric coral reef that are 386 million years old.

Several other local parks included sports fields, such as the Lapping Park, which contains a golf course, a Disc Golf course, soft ball field, shelter house, amphitheater, and hiking trails.

The city has the &quot;7th largest clock in the world&quot;, at the former Colgate-Palmolive Plant near the Ohio River. Many locals still mistakenly claim it as the &quot;2nd largest clock in the world&quot;, but it was surpassed years ago. As the Colgate company closed the plant in early 2008, the clock&#x27;s future was in question. The town has vowed to keep the clock in its current location, which can be seen from across the river in downtown Louisville, Kentucky.

The Clarksville Little Theater is one of the oldest continuously running community theaters in the United States. Also located here is Derby Dinner Playhouse, the only dinner theater in the area.
Clarksville is home to several churches, including Southeast Christian Church, Faith Assembly Church, St. Anthony Parish, and Seven Pillars Church International.

<text>Jeffersonville is a city and the county seat of Clark County, Indiana, United States, situated along the Ohio River. Locally, the city is often referred to by the abbreviated name Jeff. It lies directly across the Ohio River to the north of Louisville, Kentucky, along I-65. The population was 49,447 at the 2020 census.

Jeffersonville began its existence as a settlement around Fort Finney after 1786 and was named after Thomas Jefferson in 1801, the year he took office.

==History==


=== 18th century ===
====Pre-founding====
The foundation for what would become Jeffersonville began in 1786 when Fort Finney was established near where the Kennedy Bridge is today. U.S. Army planners chose the location for its view of a nearby bend in the Ohio River, which offered a strategic advantage in the protection of settlers from Native Americans. Overtime, a settlement grew. In 1791 the fort was renamed to Fort Steuben in honor of Baron von Steuben. Then in 1793 the fort was abandoned.

=== 19th century ===

==== Early history ====
Precisely when the settlement became known as Jeffersonville is unclear, but it was probably around 1801, the year in which President Thomas Jefferson took office. In 1802 local residents used a grid pattern designed by Thomas Jefferson for the formation of a city. On September 13, 1803, a post office was established in the city. In 1808 Indiana&#x27;s second federal land sale office was established in Jeffersonville, which initiated a growth in settling in Indiana that was further spurred by the end of the War of 1812.

In 1802, Jeffersonville replaced Springville as the county seat of Clark County. Charlestown was named the county seat in 1812 but it returned to Jeffersonville in 1878, where it remains.

In 1813 and 1814 Jeffersonville was briefly the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the Indiana Territory, as then-governor Thomas Posey disliked then-capital Corydon and decided to live in Jeffersonville to be closer to his personal physician in Louisville. The territorial legislature remained in Corydon and communicated with Posey by messenger.

==== Shipbuilding ====

In 1819 the first shipbuilding took place in Jeffersonville, and steamboats would become key to Jeffersonville&#x27;s economy. In 1834, James Howard built his first steamboat, named the Hyperion, in Jeffersonville. He established his ship building company in Jeffersonville that year but moved his business to Madison, Indiana in 1836 and remained there until 1844. Howard returned his business to the Jeffersonville area to its final location in Port Fulton in 1849. There is an annual festival held in September called Steamboat Days that celebrates Jeffersonville&#x27;s heritage.

==== Underground Railroad ====
As a free state bordering the south, Indiana served as a crucial step along the Underground Railroad. By 1830, Jeffersonville was the first and largest route for fugitives crossing the Ohio River at Louisville. Hundreds of freedom seekers made their way north to Canada through Clark County. There were many instances where Jeffersonville citizens helped fugitives flee enslavement. In the 1850s, Mayors Oswald Wooley and Uriah Damron were arrested for &quot;running off&quot; enslaved people. In 1863, Hannah Tolliver, a black wash woman, was arrested on the Louisville, Kentucky wharf as she attempted to help another woman cross the Ohio River to freedom. Hannah was convicted and became one of seven women inmates at the Kentucky State Prison at Frankfort. Dr. Nathaniel Field moved from Middletown, Kentucky to Jeffersonville in 1829. He was the head of UGRR activity in Jeffersonville, hiding escapees in his cellar during the day and sending them on to the next &quot;station&quot; at night. Field was President of the Indiana Antislavery Society and friend of Levi Coffin, the head of the Underground Railroad at Cincinnati and at Richmond, Indiana.

The Rev. Calvin Fairbank was arrested in Jeffersonville for helping the woman, Tamar, escape. He was tried in Louisville and convicted and spent decades in the Frankfort prison.

==== Civil War ====

===== Camp Joe Holt =====

During the Civil War Jeffersonville was one of the principal gateways to the South. This was largely due to its location directly opposite Louisville. Three railroads (including the Jeffersonville Railroad and the Ohio and Mississippi Railway) served Jeffersonville from the north, as well as the waterway of the Ohio River. Operating in the South, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad furnished the connecting link between Louisville and the rest of the South. These factors made the city a good location to house supplies and troops for the Union Army.

In 1862, two area regiments established the first military camp in the city. The location was christened Camp Joe Holt, and the name was retained when the camp was converted to a hospital called Joe Holt Hospital.

===== Evacuation to Jeffersonville =====
In September and October 1862, two Confederate armies led by Generals Braxton Bragg and E. Kirby Smith closed in on Louisville, a key strategic prize. General William &quot;Bull&quot; Nelson ordered women and children to evacuate. So many fled across the river to Jeffersonville that the city&#x27;s hotels and rooming houses were filled to capacity. On September 24, General Don Carlos Buell and his men managed to reach Louisville barely ahead of the Confederates. The force of 100,000 Union soldiers successfully defended Louisville and forestalled any invasion.

===== Jefferson General Hospital =====
Between 1864 and 1866 Port Fulton (now within Jeffersonville) was home to Jefferson General Hospital, the third largest hospital in the country at that time. The institution was built to replace Joe Holt Hospital and occupied land obtained from U.S. Senator Jesse D. Bright, a Confederate sympathizer. The land stretched down to the Ohio River, facilitating patient transfer from riverboats to the hospital. The facility contained 24 wards each radiating out like spokes on a wheel and all connected by a corridor one-half mile in circumference. Each ward was 150 feet long and 22 feet wide and could accommodate 60 patients. Female nurses and matrons were quartered separately from the men. During its nearly three-year existence the institution cared for more than 16,000 patients and served more than 2,500,000 meals.

===== Construction of the Quartermaster Depot =====
The Jeffersonville Quartermaster Depot had its first beginnings in the early days of the Civil War as a storage depot for the Union Quartermaster Department. As the war came to a close all military supply depots along the Ohio Valley were shut down (except Jeffersonville&#x27;s), and their supplies were stored at the Jeffersonville location. In 1871, the U.S. Army began consolidating operations in the city into four square blocks. Throughout the rest of the 19th century, the Quartermaster Depot continued supplying troops engaged in frontier wars with Native Americans.

===20th and 21st century===

==== Construction of the Carnegie Library ====

On December 17, 1900, Jeffersonville officially opened a new Jeffersonville Township Public Library in a room above the Citizens National Bank. 1400 books formed the initial collection. Soon, the Carnegie Foundation donated $16,000 for the construction of a new library building – a beaux arts, copper-domed landmark. The building was designed by Jeffersonville architect Arthur Loomis. Masonic officials laid the building&#x27;s cornerstone on September 19, 1903, in Warder Park. When the Carnegie Library opened in 1905, it contained 3,869 volumes. Whereas in later years grants from the Carnegie Foundation were scaled back to prevent the construction of lavish libraries, the library in Warder Park was relatively ornate.

Due to the Ohio River Flood of 1937, the library suffered a near total loss of its collection. However, it reopened in November 1937 thanks to months of work and donations of money and books.

==== World War I ====

During World War I, Jeffersonville contributed to the war effort largely through its production capabilities. On the eve of war, the Quartermaster Depot began producing a wide range in items, including saddles, harnesses, stoves, and kitchen utensils. Most famously, though, the depot produced 700,000 shirts per month, earning it the nickname &quot;America&#x27;s largest shirt factory.&quot; Meanwhile, the American Car and Foundry Company&#x27;s local plant manufactured a variety of products ranging from components for over 228,000 artillery shells to 18,156 cake turners.

Shortly after the war ended in 1918, civilian employment at the Quartermaster Depot fell to 445, and military presence dropped to just ten officers and two enlisted.

==== Religious revivals in the 1920s ====
For a brief period in the mid-1920s and early 1930s, Roy E. Davis, a founding member of the 1915 Ku Klux Klan, hosted a series of religious revivals in Jeffersonville. He also moved his First Pentecostal Baptist Church there, and held revivals in neighboring states. Meanwhile, he routinely challenged the &quot;Jeffersonville Evening News&quot; for its depiction of his church, eventually starting a new publication called &quot;The Banner of Truth&quot; to publicize his services and aid recruitment. Much of his popularity stemmed from his vocal opposition of prohibition.

In 1934, a fire destroyed Davis&#x27;s First Pentecostal Baptist Church. After years of legal trouble, Davis was denied a permit to rebuild. He left Jeffersonville, and William Branham – formerly a ministering elder in Davis&#x27;s church – became pastor of the congregation. Branham moved the group to a new building, eventually naming it Branham Tabernacle, as it is known today.

==== Flood of 1937 ====

Jeffersonville was one of many communities affected by the Ohio River flood of 1937. After record rainfall in mid-January, 90% of the city was flooded, electricity was lost, all roads leading into the city were covered, and a levee failed. The Indiana National Guard deployed to the area to help those displaced, distribute much-needed emergency supplies, inoculate residents for typhoid fever, and purify drinking water. Finally by the end of the month the water began to recede. The flood left an estimated $250 million worth of damage throughout the Ohio Valley.

==== &quot;Little Las Vegas&quot; ====

In the 1930s and 1940s, gambling was instrumental in Jeffersonville&#x27;s recovery from the Great Depression and the Flood of 1937. This earned the town the nickname &quot;Little Las Vegas&quot;. During this time, Jeffersonville attracted the likes of Clark Gable, John Dillinger, Al Capone, and others. After Clarence Amster, a New Albany resident was gunned down on July 2, 1937, public sentiment turned against gambling and the mobsters it brought. In 1938, James L. Bottorff was elected judge and announced that gambling would not be tolerated. The Club Greyhound, a major dog racing track known for fixing races, was raided and closed within a year, with others soon following.

==== World War II ====
Having acquired the Howard Shipyards in 1925, the U.S. Navy awarded the Jeffersonville Boat &amp; Machine Company (later known as Jeffboat) a contract to build boats during World War II. Jeffboat built landing vessels such as the LST, and swelled in number of employees from 200 to 13,000 people. After the war ended, the Navy sold the Howard Shipyard to Jeffboat.

Also during World War II, the Quartermaster Depot, in conjunction with Fort Knox, Kentucky, housed German prisoners of war until 1945.

==== End of segregation ====
Jeffersonville ended segregation in its public schools in 1952, two years before the Supreme Court case &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; ruled that segregation was unconstitutional. Prior to this, Jeffersonville High School was reserved for white high school students. Meanwhile, black students in grades one through twelve were sent to Taylor High School. While &quot;The New York Times&quot; held up Jeffersonville as a model for all &quot;southern-minded&quot; cities, integration came at a cost. Though black students were allowed to attend the newly integrated Jeffersonville High School, black instructors previously employed at Taylor High School were terminated.

====Annexation====

On February 5, 2008, the city of Jeffersonville officially annexed four out of six planned annex zones. The proposed annexation of the other two zones was postponed due to lawsuits. One of the two areas remaining to be annexed was Oak Park, Indiana an area of about 5,000 more citizens. The areas annexed added about to the city and about 4,500 citizens, raising the population to an estimated 33,100. The total area planned to be annexed was . The areas received planning and zoning, building permits and drainage issues services immediately, with new in-city sewer rates. Other services were phased in, such as police and fire, and worked jointly with the pre-existing non-city services until they were available.

The Clark County Courts dismissed the lawsuits against the city on February 25, 2008. This dismissal brought the remaining Oak Park area into the city. The population of the city grew to nearly 50,000 citizens, making it the largest annexation in Jeffersonville&#x27;s history.

====Big Four Pedestrian Bridge and Big Four Station====

Conceived in the 1990s and completed in 2014, the Big Four Bridge was converted to a pedestrian bridge in a joint effort between Kentucky and Indiana governments. An average of 1.5 million pedestrians and bicycles cross the roughly-1/2 mile bridge each year. 1/4 mile ramps complete the bridge on each end. The bridge is also decorated with a colorful LED lighting system that operates from twilight to 1 am. The lights can be customized by request.

On the Jeffersonville side of the bridge the city constructed Big Four Station, a plaza and park. The park features green space, fountains, a farmers market on Saturdays, a restroom, a bike-sharing station, a pavilion, a playground, and easy access to downtown shops and restaurants. Big Four Station is also the home of the annual Abbey Road on the River, the largest Beatles-inspired music festival in the world, as well as other annual celebrations.

<text>Utica is a town in Utica Township, Clark County, Indiana, United States. The population was 776 at the 2010 census.

==History==
From 1794 to 1825, Utica was a popular ferry crossing, as ferry crossings were considered too dangerous at Jeffersonville, due to inexperienced ferry operators and the Falls of the Ohio. James Noble Wood, the founder of Utica, was the first ferryman in the area, and he served as one of only a handful of territorial judges in &quot;Indian Territory&quot; during this period.

After a flood in 1997, Utica grew because it was required to strengthen its building, planning, and zoning laws in order to obtain Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Indiana DNR rebuilding funds. However, Utica is unlikely to see much more growth due to being surrounded by the Port of Indiana – Jeffersonville, a new I-265 bridge over the Ohio River at Utica (complete late 2016), and the River Ridge Commerce Center.

<text>Clay City is a town in Harrison Township, Clay County, Indiana, United States. The population was 861 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Terre Haute Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Clay City was originally called Markland, and under this latter name was platted in 1873 when the railroad was extended to that point.
However, there was another post office with that name in the state, so this name could not be used because there was already an extant &quot;Markland, Indiana.&quot; The name Huntersville was then adopted in honor of Congressman Morton C. Hunter. The Congressman was not popular in the local area, however, so residents objected to the name, and the name &quot;Clay City&quot; was eventually chosen by a local committee. Clay City is named for Kentucky statesman Henry Clay.

<text>Frankfort is a city in Clinton County, Indiana, United States. It had a population of 16,715 as of the 2020 census. The city is the county seat of Clinton County.

==History==
Brothers John, William and Nicholas Pence, previously of Warren County, Ohio, settled on the land on which Frankfort now stands in 1829, having entered it from the government in 1827 and 1828. In 1830, the brothers donated of the land to the county commissioners, a donation which led to the establishment of the county seat at that site rather than in Jefferson, a community which had also been vying for the honor. The new town was named Frankfort at the brothers&#x27; request and honors their German great-grandparents&#x27; home of Frankfurt am Main.

The town of Frankfort was laid off on the tract by William Douglass, the county agent, and the plat filed on June 8, 1830. The original plat consisted of 64 lots in eight blocks surrounding a public square where the courthouse now stands. The county board paid contractors Allen &amp; Michael the sum of $20 to erect the first courthouse, a -story temporary structure made of logs hewn from trees that grew on the square and surrounding streets. Its replacement was built by contractor John Elder in 1837 and 1838 for $12,000 and operated for 45 years. Indianapolis architect George W. Bunting in 1881 designed the third courthouse, a tall structure built of Indiana limestone by contractors Farman &amp; Pearce for approximately $200,000. Its cornerstone was laid September 2, 1882.

The youngest elected mayor of Frankfort was Robert Keene at the age of 21 when he took office in January 1922 just one month prior to the fire at Old Stoney on February 24, 1922. At the time of the fire, Old Stoney was used as the high school. Today, Old Stoney is used as City Hall.

In addition to Old Stoney, the Christian Ridge Historic District, Clinton County Courthouse, Charles H. and Emma Condon House, Frankfort Commercial Historic District, and South Frankfort Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
