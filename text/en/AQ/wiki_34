<doc id="108565" wikidata="Q74198" url="?curid=108565" title="Trinidad, Colorado">
<text>Trinidad is the home rule municipality that is the county seat and the most populous municipality of Las Animas County, Colorado, United States. The population was 8,329 as of the 2020 census. Trinidad lies north of Raton, New Mexico, and south of Denver. It is on the historic Santa Fe Trail.

The city is home to Trinidad State College, the oldest community college in Colorado.

==History==
===Early===
Trinidad was first explored by Spanish and Mexican traders, who liked its proximity to the Santa Fe Trail. It was founded in 1862 soon after coal was discovered in the region. This led to an influx of immigrants eager to capitalize on this natural resource. By the late 1860s, the town had about 1,200 residents. Trinidad was officially incorporated in 1876, just a few months before Colorado became a state. In 1878 the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway reached Trinidad, making it easier for goods to be shipped from distant locations. In the 1880s Trinidad became home to a number of well-known people, including Bat Masterson, who briefly served as the town&#x27;s marshal in 1882. By 1900 Trinidad&#x27;s population had grown to 7,500 and it had two English-language newspapers and one in Spanish. In 1885, Holy Trinity Catholic Church was constructed.

In the early 1900s Trinidad became nationally known for having the first woman sports editor of a newspaper, Ina Eloise Young. Her expertise was in baseball, and in 1908 she was the only woman sportswriter to cover the World Series. During the same time, Trinidad was home to a popular semiprofessional baseball team that was briefly coached by Damon Runyon. 
On August 7, 1902, the Bowen Town coal mine, six miles north of Trinidad, experienced a horrific gas explosion, killing 13 miners. It was one of the worst mining disasters so far in the state; conditions in the mine provided the impetus for several labor strikes. At one point in late 1903, an estimated 3,000 miners, members of the United Mine Workers of America, went on strike. In 1904 Trinidad experienced several disasters. In mid-January a fire destroyed two blocks of the town&#x27;s business section, causing more than $75,000 in damages. In late September, the Trinidad area and the region along the Purgatoire River endured an unusually heavy rainstorm, leading to severe flooding; the flood destroyed the Santa Fe railroad station, wiped out every bridge in town, and caused several hundred thousand dollars&#x27; worth of property damage. As Trinidad continued to grow, a number of new construction projects began in the downtown area, including a new library, a new city hall, an opera house, and a new hotel.

====1913â1914 strike====
Trinidad became the a focal point of the 1913-1914 United Mine Workers of America strike against the Rockefeller-owned Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron company, which has come to be known as the Colorado Coalfield War. The Colorado and Southern Railway stop that connected Trinidad with Denver and Walsenburg made the town strategically important for both the strikers and Colorado National Guard. On April 20, 1914, just 18Â miles north of town, the events of the Ludlow Massacre occurred.

===Late 20th century onward===
Trinidad was dubbed the &quot;Sex Change Capital of the World&quot;, because a local doctor had an international reputation for performing sex reassignment surgery. In the 1960s, Stanley Biber, a veteran surgeon returning from Korea, decided to move to Trinidad because he had heard that the town needed a surgeon. In 1969 a local social worker asked him to perform the surgery for her, which he learned by consulting diagrams and a New York surgeon. Biber attained a reputation as a good surgeon at a time when very few doctors were performing sex-change operations. At his peak he averaged four sex-change operations a day, and the term &quot;taking a trip to Trinidad&quot; became a euphemism for some seeking the procedures he offered. In 1995, Claudine Griggs published &quot;Passage through Trinidad: Journal of a Surgical Sex Change&quot; about her experience with Biber. Biber was featured in an episode of &quot;South Park&quot;, in which elementary school teacher Mr. Garrison undergoes a sex-change operation. Biber&#x27;s surgical practice was taken over in 2003 by Marci Bowers. Bowers has since moved the practice to Burlingame, California. The 2008 documentary &quot;Trinidad&quot; focuses on Bowers and two of her patients.

Drop City, a counterculture artists&#x27; community, was formed in 1965 on land about north of Trinidad. Founded by art students and filmmakers from the University of Kansas and University of Colorado at Boulder, Drop City became known as the first rural &quot;hippie commune&quot;, and received attention from &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; magazines, as well as from reporters around the world. Drop City was abandoned by the early 1970s, but influenced subsequent alternative-living projects across the country.
In 2015, Trinidad started to experience a new boom due to the marijuana industry. The town raised $4.4 million in tax revenue from $44 million in annual marijuana sales, about 5.13% of the state&#x27;s total sales. In 2018 &quot;High Times&quot; called Trinidad &quot;Weed Town, USA&quot;, noting that its 23 licensed retail marijuana dispensaries serving less than 10,000 people amounts to one dispensary per 352 people. &quot;In one downtown block alone along Commercial Street, there were five dispensaries in a single building in town which the owner referred to as the &quot;World&#x27;s First Pot Mini Mall&quot;, others call it the &#x27;weed mall&#x27;.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

Trinidad is situated in the Purgatoire River valley in far southern Colorado at an elevation of . The city lies 13Â mi north of the New Mexico border. On the northern end of the town is Simpson&#x27;s Rest, a prominent bluff named for early resident George Simpson, who is buried atop it. North Avenue leads to a rut-prone county road to the top of Simpson&#x27;s Rest for overviews of the city. The vista from Simpson&#x27;s Rest includes Fishers Peak, a prominent mountain of in elevation, southeast of the city. To the northwest are the prominent Spanish Peaks.

===Climate===
Trinidad experiences a semiarid climate, with hot summers and cold winters. Summer days are hot, but due to Trinidad&#x27;s high elevation summer nights are cool, and temperatures drop sharply after sunset. Winters are cold, but milder than in many mountain towns in Colorado. In the winter, daytime highs are usually above freezing, but temperatures below are possible, especially at night.

==Economy==

For many years Trinidad housed the miners who worked in the coal mines of the Raton Basin south and west of the town. Major operators included Colorado Fuel and Iron and Victor-American Fuel Company. The mines are now closed, but since the 1980s companies have been drilling new gas wells to extract coalbed methane from the remaining coal seams.

Trinidad&#x27;s location at the foot of Raton Pass, along the Santa Fe Trail between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Santa Fe, New Mexico, has always made it a favored route for travelers, first by foot, then horse and ox-drawn wagon, then railroad. Interstate 25 is the most highly traveled route between Colorado and New Mexico and bisects Trinidad.

In the early 20th century, Trinidad was the closest town to what many consider the beginning of the labor movement. Later that century the town saw swings of boom and bust as the oil industry heated and cooled.

<doc id="108569" wikidata="Q2074898" url="?curid=108569" title="Limon, Colorado">
<text>Limon is a statutory town in Lincoln County, Colorado, United States. Its population was 2,043 at the 2020 United States Census, the most populous municipality of the county. Limon lies at the intersection of Interstate 70, U.S. Highways 24, 40, 287, and Colorado Highway 71. 

==History==

Railroads were the major factor for Limon&#x27;s original founding and location. The Kansas Pacific Railroad made its way across the plains from southern Kansas following the Smoky Hill Trail in 1870. In 1888, the Chicago, Rock Island, and Pacific Railroad (now the Kyle Railroad) made its way west to east from Colorado Springs, entering Lincoln County and intersecting the Kansas Pacific (now Union Pacific) at the present day location of Limon. This union of the two railroads was the earliest founding of the &quot;Hub City&quot;.

===Porter lynching===
Limon was the site of a lynching on November 16, 1900. Preston Porter Jr, a sixteen-year-old African-American male, had confessed under duress to the murder of eleven-year-old Louise Frost who was Caucasian. Porter was apparently being held some 90 miles away in Denver, but was sent back to Limon by request of unspecified people and against the wishes of Sheriff Freeman. When the train carrying Porter stopped in Limon, sixteen men selected from a mob of 300 &quot;marked by calmness and determination&quot; took Porter from Freeman&#x27;s custody despite the sheriff&#x27;s protestations &quot;in the name of law.&quot; Originally it was announced that Porter would be hanged but many in the crowd including R. W. Frost, the girl&#x27;s father, objected &quot;that such a death would be too easy.&quot; The method was left to Frost who decided upon burning at the stake. Frost also refused to allow mutilation of Porter&#x27;s body before burning. While waiting for his execution, Porter sat next to a bonfire reading the Gospel of Luke from the Bible. Porter was chained to an iron railroad rail set in the ground on the exact spot where the murder had taken place and burned to death, the match to start the fire being set by the girl&#x27;s father. Lynchings of this type were apparently rare, as reporters on the scene wrote: &quot;The general sentiment expressed approves the execution of the negro, but deprecates the method adopted.&quot;

===1990 tornado===
On June 6, 1990, an F3 tornado touched down near Matheson (about 16 miles west of Limon), tearing roughly east-northeast through fields. Minutes later, the then rain-wrapped tornado arrived, devastating the city. The storm injured 14 people, but remarkably no one was killed. Most of Limon&#x27;s business district had been laid to ruins in just moments.

Governor Roy Romer declared Limon a disaster area the next day.

The Farmer&#x27;s Alfalfa Milling Company started in 1918. There were also two doctors, Daniels and Houff, who owned a drug store. In 1920 the Glory Park Theater opened. In 1923 a town Marshall was hired and an old rail boxcar was used as a jail. In 1928 the Catholic Church was built.

The growth declined during the depression, and again during World War II. In 1957 there were eleven businesses that slowly diminished with more people willing to drive 12 miles to Sterling, CO and the opening of Interstate 76, which took all but local travelers off of state highway 138.

<doc id="108581" wikidata="Q1191112" url="?curid=108581" title="Fruita, Colorado">
<text>Fruita () is a home rule municipality located in western Mesa County, Colorado, United States. The city population was 13,395 at the 2020 United States census. Fruita is a part of the Grand Junction, Colorado Metropolitan Statistical Area and lies within the Grand Valley. The geography is identified by the bordering Colorado River (historically known as the Grand River) on the southern edge of the town, the Uncompahgre Plateau known for its pinyon-juniper landscape, and the Book Cliffs range on the northern edge of the Grand Valley. Originally home to the Ute people, farmers settled the town after founder William Pabor in 1884. Ten years later, Fruita was incorporated.

Fruita started out as a fruit-producing region. Today it is well known for its outdoor sports such as mountain biking, hiking, disc golfing and rafting, its proximity to the Colorado National Monument, and its annual festivals, such as Mike the Headless Chicken. Fruita has been the winner of the Governor&#x27;s Smart Growth and Development Award for four consecutive years. The city motto is &quot;Honor the Past, Envision the Future&quot;.

==History==
Fruita has had steady population growth for over a century, with descendants of many of the original pioneers still living in the area. The first permanent homesteaders in the Fruita area were possibly Mr. and Mrs. Albert Lapham who settled in late 1882. They resided in a pre-existing cabin with a dirt floor and a blanket door. They were followed by other settlers, nearly all of whom were farmers of one sort or another. The present town was established on May 1, 1884, by William E. Pabor, when he formed the Fruita Town and Land Company. In 1886, for the cost of $500 a farmer could buy five acres, 200 fruit trees and water. Pabor recognized the great promise of the Grand Valley and penned a 300-page volume, &quot;Colorado as an Agricultural State&quot;, in which he spoke of the fruit-growing potential of this area. Having worked with the Horace Greeley Union Colony, he founded the town in a similar way, including the provision that no liquor be sold or manufactured in the town. This provision lasted until it was voted out in the late 1970s.

The original town site was planned for with a park in the middle. The first water reached the town from the Colorado River in 1907. By 1909, the town center was linked with electricity. In the 1930s, Fruita participated in several government projects, including the Grand Valley Resettlement Project (later Western Slope Farms). Settled in groups of two or three families per area, 34 families were relocated by 1937. Later, the Rural Electrification Project brought electricity to around 800 or 900 farms. Fruita also had a Civilian Conservation Corps, several Works Progress Administration projects including the town library (now the Chamber of Commerce), a federal loan for the new central school (now the Civic Center) and the construction of the Rim Rock Drive to the top of the Colorado National Monument, elevation . Today, the historic activities of Fruita are supported by the efforts of the Fruita Historic Preservation Board and the Lower Valley Heritage Chapter.

From approximately 1900 to 1930, Fruita was a sundown town. Cowboy Charlie Glass was prohibited by law from being buried in the town cemetery, but he was still interred there.

On April 6, 2010, Fruita became the first city in the world to enact a marijuana tax.

===Paleontology===
In 1900, paleontologist Elmer Riggs and crew, from the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, found the first known &quot;Brachiosaurus altithorax&quot; at a location later called &quot;Riggs Hill&quot;, located off what is now State Highway 340 in Grand Junction. Led there by communications with Dr. S. M. Bradbury of Grand Puns, Riggs had heard that ranchers had been collecting fossils around the area for 20 years. In 1901, Riggs and crew found nearly two thirds of a &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; skeleton on the northeast side of Dinosaur Hill, in Fruita. This is still considered to be one of the finest specimens known. Later, other sauropod bones were also found, which eventually led to the landmark&#x27;s name. The animals were from the late Jurassic Age (150 million years ago) and within the Morrison Formation.

Fossils of the &quot;Fruitadens&quot; (a heterodontosaurid dinosaur), one of the world&#x27;s smallest known plant-eating dinosaur, were first found in the Fruita Paleontological Area (within the McInnis Canyons National Conservation Area) off Kings View Road in the 1970s and 1980s. The name means &quot;Fruita tooth&quot;. There is a replica on display at the Dinosaur Journey Museum. The museum is a part of the Museum of Western Colorado and has information on local paleontology and geology.

Also found here and named after the town is the Mesozoic mammal &quot;Fruitafossor&quot; (&quot;Fruita digger&quot;), discovered 2005. It was a small animal at less than 10 grams body mass, and had a lifestyle similar to modern-day armadillos but was not related to them, but rather close to the ancestor of all therian mammals. Thus, this important find proves that the first &quot;modern&quot; mammals lived in the Jurassic already.

The region is within the Dinosaur Diamond Scenic Byway and includes two other nearby dinosaur-related sites: Mygatt-Moore Quarry and Trail Through Time off Interstate 70 exit 2.

===Properties===
The stone cottage building located at 432 East Aspen Avenue was built in 1938 by the Works Progress Administration.

Owned by the City of Fruita, it has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1996.

The two-and-a-half-story, Queen Anne Style stone house at 798 North Mesa Street was built in 1908 by builder A.B. Mahany and first owner Harry Alvah Phillips. It is known locally as the Phillips House and currently run as the Stonehaven Bed and Breakfast. It is bordered by mature cottonwoods, agricultural land, and the Elmwood Cemetery. It is on the National Register of Historic Places.

The two-story Neoclassical building located on 325 East Aspen Avenue was built in 1912 with an addition added in 1936. It was built by the Works Progress Administration as the Central Grade School. In 1993, city and state funds enabled a major renovation, placing it on the State Register of Historic Properties. It currently is the home to the Fruita Civic Center.

<text>Grand Junction is a home rule municipality that is the county seat and largest city of Mesa County, Colorado, United States. Grand Junction&#x27;s population was 65,560 at the 2020 United States Census, making it the most populous city in western Colorado and the 17th most populous Colorado municipality overall.

As western Colorado&#x27;s largest city, Grand Junction is the economic and cultural center of the Western Slope region. The city is a transportation hub, as it is situated at the convergence of Interstate 70 and U.S. Highway 50, and is the largest city between Denver and Salt Lake City. Grand Junction is also a prominent college town, home to Colorado Mesa University. 

Grand Junction is the principal city of the Grand Junction metropolitan area, which had over 150,000 residents in 2020. The city is located in the heart of the Grand Valley, a large Colorado River valley stretching over 30 miles east-to-west and 5 miles north-to-south. This valley is the most densely populated area in Colorado outside of the Front Range Urban Corridor.

==Description==
Grand Junction is west-southwest of the Colorado State Capitol in Denver. The city has a councilâmanager form of government. It is a major commercial and transportation hub within the large area between the Green River and the Continental Divide, and the largest city in Colorado outside of the Front Range Corridor.

The city is along the Colorado River, at its confluence with the Gunnison River, which comes in from the south. &quot;Grand&quot; refers to the historical Grand River, renamed the Upper Colorado River in 1921. &quot;Junction&quot; refers to the confluence of the Colorado and Gunnison rivers. Grand Junction has been nicknamed &quot;River City&quot;. It is near the midpoint of a arcing valley, known as the Grand Valley; since the late 19th century it has been a major fruit-growing region. The valley was long occupied by the Ute people and earlier indigenous cultures. It was not settled by European-American farmers until the 1880s. Since the late 20th century, several wineries have been established in the area.

The Colorado National Monument, a unique series of canyons and mesas, overlooks the city on the west. Most of the area is surrounded by federal public lands managed by the US Bureau of Land Management. Interstate 70 connects the city eastward to Glenwood Springs and Denver and westward to Green River, Utah; Salt Lake City is reached to the west via Interstate 70 and U.S Route 6; and Las Vegas (via Interstate 70 and Interstate 15).

==History==
In September 1881, the former Ute Indian Territory was abolished and the Utes were forced into a reservation so that the U.S. government could open the area to settlers. Clinton County, Pennsylvania-born George Addison Crawford (1827â91) soon purchased a plot of land. On July 22, 1882, he incorporated the town of Grand Junction and planted Colorado&#x27;s first vineyard near Palisade, Colorado, causing the area to become known as the Colorado Wine Country.
Grand Junction also has a storied past with gunfighters, miners, and early settlers of the American Southwest. Prior to its incorporation as the city of Grand Junction, the community was known as Ute, and was also briefly called West Denver.

The narrow gauge Denver and Rio Grande Railroad reached Grand Junction from the southeast, from Pueblo via Gunnison in 1882, followed in 1890 by the standard gauge Rio Grande Junction Railway from the northeast, from New Castle (jointly owned by the D&amp;RG and the Colorado Midland). These greatly contributed to the expansion and settlement of the area.

==Geography==
At the 2020 United States Census, the city had a total area of (40.077 sq mi) including (.443 sq mi) of water.

==Climate==
Grand Junction has a cold semi-arid climate (KÃ¶ppen: &quot;BSk&quot;). It sits in a large area of high desert lands in Western Colorado. Winters are cold and dry, with a January mean temperature of . Due to its location &quot;west&quot; of the Rockies, Grand Junction does not receive as much influence from the Chinook winds as locations in Colorado east of the Front Range, yet it does receive protection from the Arctic air masses that can settle to the east of the Rockies. This is illustrated by the fact that from December to February, highs reach only 18 days. Lows drop to or below on 2.9 nights per year. Snowfall is low compared to much of the rest of the state, averaging per season; only once in the entire period of record dating to 1893, has observed in a calendar day, though the median is , and moreover, snow cover is intermittent. Snow is greatest in December and January. Spring warming is gradual but quickens when nearing June; the average last freeze date is April 25. Summer is hot and dry, with a July mean temperature of . Grand Junction averages 68 days a year with temperatures at or above, and an average 8 days attaining or more. Autumn cooling is rapid, with the average first freeze date being October 11. The area receives little precipitation year-round, averaging , with no real seasonal spike. Sunshine hours are abundant, even in winter, and total just over 3,200 hours per year, or 73% of the possible total.

==Economy==
===Economic history===
From the time settlers arrived in the 1880s until the 1960s, three of the main economic activities in the region were farming, fruit growing, and cattle raising. Fruit orchards, particularly between Grand Junction and Palisade to the east, remain important to the region&#x27;s reputation and economy to the present day. Fruits most often grown are peaches, pears, apricots, plums, cherries, and, particularly since the 1980s, grapes for wine. In this semi-arid environment, these orchards thrive from a combination of abundant sunshine and irrigation from a system of canals that divert water from the Colorado River.

Attempts were made to establish sugar beet farming and beet sugar production. The Grand Valley Sugar Company established a campaign in 1893, sending three train carloads to the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company. Several tariffs and subsidies to domestic sugar were established in the 1890s, which led to uncertainty in the market. After the 1897 Dingley Act, the company was revived in 1898 and rallied to build a sugar factory. They failed to fundraise to build the plant. At the same time, Charles N. Cox was able to organize an effort to establish a factory in 1898 as well. John F. Campion and others including James Joseph Brown, Eben Smith, Charles E. Mitchell, George Trimble, James R. McKinnie, and Charles Boettcher invested, creating the Colorado Sugar Manufacturing Company in 1899 and contracting E. H. Dyer to build a factory. The failed to succeed, so they sold the plant to local investors, who were able to make it a success. The Campion-Boettcher group then created the Great Western Sugar Company.

Retail sales have been important to the economy for decades (e.g., gasoline, and hunting- and fishing-related sales). 

Grand Junction was home to the Climax Uranium Mill, a now decommissioned mill that provided uranium ore to the US Atomic Energy Commission. It produced 2.2 million tons of uranium tailings a by product of uranium mining which can be unsafe. For decades, Grand Junction residents were able to collect as much of the fine gray sand as they wanted for free. It was used as construction material all over town.

Education and healthcare have been important to the economy of the area, especially since the 1950s, with the rise of Colorado Mesa University and St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital as leading employers in these fields.

Vast oil shale reserves were known to exist near Parachute, Colorado in the Piceance Basin. The oil embargoes of the 1970s and high gas prices resulted in major financial interest in the region. Exxon purchased rights and used Grand Junction as its seat of operations. The city and the surrounding Grand Valley became prosperous in the 1970s and early 1980s largely because of the effects of oil shale development. The United States, western Colorado in particular, has the largest-known concentration of oil shale in the world (according to the Bureau of Land Management) and holds an estimated 800 gigabarrels of recoverable oil, enough to meet U.S. demand for oil at current levels for 110 years. Known as the &quot;Rock That Burns&quot;, the shale can be mined and processed to produce oil. In the past it was significantly more expensive than conventional oil. Sustained prices above $95 per barrel, however, may make extraction economically attractive in the coming years (see Oil shale economics). ExxonMobil pulled out of the region because of lower oil prices, which led to economic hardship in the region.

The economic bust, known as &quot;Black Sunday&quot; (May 2, 1982) to the locals, started with a phone call from the president of Exxon to Governor Richard Douglas Lamm, stating that Exxon would cut its losses while retaining mining rights to the (then and currently) uneconomic oil. The economic bust was felt statewide, as Exxon had invested more than 5 billion in the state. Colorado historian Tom Noel observed, &quot;I think that was a definite turning point, and it was a reminder that we were a boom-and-bust state ... There were parallels to the silver crash of 1893.&quot;

By 2008, the economy of Grand Junction appeared to be more diverse and stable than it had been in previous decades. Major contributors to the economy were health care, tourism, agriculture, livestock, and energy mining (gas and oil). Major energy companies had once again invested large amounts of money due to increases in oil and natural gas prices (such as in the years 2005â2008). However, a major drop (in the summer of 2008) of market natural gas prices led to reduced gas well drilling and related capital expenditures in the area, significantly slowing the Grand Junction economy in 2009. Reports given in 2009 suggested that Grand Junction had once again been hard-hit economically, with one report by April 2010 listing the area as having had the largest percentage drop in employment of any &quot;small city&quot; in the entire United States.

By 2008, Grand Junction was being discovered by the &quot;nation&#x27;s elite business and leisure travelers&quot; as a destination for private jet travel, with nearby Powderhorn Resort and other ski resorts a major attraction.

The city also has a professional Minor League Baseball team, the Grand Junction Jackalopes, who play in the Pioneer Baseball League. The Jackalopes were formerly known as the Grand Junction Rockies and were a minor league affiliate of the Colorado Rockies, but became independent in 2020.

Both Suplizio Field and Stocker Stadium also host Colorado Mesa University as well as School District 51 sporting events.

==Parks and recreation==
The Grand Junction area has developed as a mountain biking destination, with many bikers coming from the Front Range of Colorado, the Salt Lake City area, and as far away as California to enjoy the area&#x27;s abundant single-track trails. Two prominent trails are the Tabeguache and Kokopelli trails, the latter running from near Loma to Moab, Utah. Fruita, Colorado, with its 18-Road trail system, is within 10 miles of the city and has become a major mountain biking destination.

<doc id="108587" wikidata="Q2276193" url="?curid=108587" title="Creede, Colorado">
<text>Creede is a Statutory Town and the county seat of Mineral County, Colorado, United States. It is the most populous community and the only incorporated municipality within the county. The town population was 257 at the 2020 United States census.

==History==
Travelers to this area appeared in the early 19th century. Tom Boggs, a brother-in-law of Kit Carson, farmed at Wagon Wheel Gap in the summer of 1840. In 1869, the first silver discovery was made at the Alpha mine, but the silver could not be extracted at a profit from the complex ores. Ranchers and homesteaders moved in when stagecoach stations (linking the mining operations over the Divide with the east) were built in the 1870s. However, the great &quot;Boom Days&quot; started with the discovery of rich minerals in Willow Creek Canyon in 1889.

Creede was originally located on East Willow Creek just above its junction with West Willow Creek, however, it was originally named Willow. The post office opened on May 12, 1891, and it was renamed Creede on July 1, 1891, after Nicholas C. Creede who discovered the Holy Moses Mine. Below Creede were Stringtown, Jimtown, and Amethyst. The Amethyst, Colorado, post office opened on January 25, 1892. The Town of Creede was incorporated on May 19, 1892. Soon the entire area from East Willow to Amethyst was called Creede. The Creede, Colorado, post office moved to North Creede on November 28, 1908, where it remained open until April 15, 1919. The Amethyst, Colorado, post office closed on February 2, 1909, but reopened as the new Creede, Colorado, post office on February 9, 1909.

In the 19th century, Creede was the last silver boom town in Colorado. It leapt from a population of 600 in 1889 to more than 10,000 in December 1891. The Creede mines operated continuously from 1890 until 1985, and were served by the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railroad.

While Creede was booming, the capital city of Denver, Colorado was experiencing a reform movement against gambling clubs and saloons. Numerous owners of gambling houses in Denver relocated to Creede&#x27;s business district. One of these was confidence man Jefferson Randolph &quot;Soapy&quot; Smith. Soapy became the uncrowned king of Creede&#x27;s criminal underworld, and opened the Orleans Club. Other famous people in Creede were Robert Ford (the man who killed outlaw Jesse James), Bat Masterson, and William Sidney &quot;Cap&quot; Light (the first deputy sheriff in Creede, and brother-in-law of Soapy Smith). On June 5, 1892, a fire destroyed most of the business district. Three days later, on June 8, Ed O&#x27;Kelley walked into Robert Ford&#x27;s makeshift tent-saloon and shot him dead. The town of Creede was incorporated on June 13, 1892. The anti-gambling movement in Denver had ceased, and the Denver businessmen moved back to their former areas of operation.

Creede&#x27;s boom lasted until 1893, when the Silver Panic hit the silver mining towns in Colorado. The price of silver plummeted, and most of the silver mines were closed. Creede never became a ghost town, although the boom was over and its population declined. After 1900, Creede stayed alive by relying increasingly on lead and zinc in the ores. Total production through 1966 was of silver, of gold, 112 thousand metric tons of lead, 34 thousand metric tons of zinc, and 2 million metric tons of copper.

==Geography==
Creede is located near the headwaters of the Rio Grande, which flows through the San Juan Mountains and the San Luis Valley on its way to New Mexico, Texas, and eventually into the Gulf of Mexico.

The river has played a critical role in the development of farming and ranching in the Valley. The Rio Grande and its tributary trout streams provide excellent opportunities for fly fishermen and its unspoiled headwaters in the Weminuche Wilderness are a favorite for hikers.

At the 2020 United States Census, the town had a total area of , all of it land.

==Arts and culture==
The Creede Fork, also known as the World&#x27;s Largest Fork, is a 40-foot aluminum sculpture and roadside attraction in Creede built in 2012. It is the largest fork in the United States, beating out the 35-foot-long () fork in Missouri that previously held the record. Created by artists Chev and Ted Yund, the fork is made of aluminum and weighs over . In January 2018, it was named by The Daily Meal as the weirdest tourist attraction in Colorado.

The fork was commissioned by Keith Siddel as a birthday present for his wife, Denise Dutwiler. Siddel hired two local artists, Chev and Ted Yund, to create the structure. The fork was designed specifically to out-measure the Giant Fork in Springfield, Missouri, which previously held the record of being the longest fork in the United States at a length of 35 feet.


The Creede Repertory Theatre was founded in 1966 by twelve University of Kansas students who answered the call from the Creede Junior Chamber of Commerce (Jaycees). It has since grown to a fully professional theatre company with an operating budget of over $1.5 million. Its annual production schedule includes a variety of plays, musicals, and new work, as well as musical events and concerts. Creede Rep is a true rotating repertory company which means that a visitor to the area can see up to five different shows in one weekend. In addition to these performances, the theatre offers a program for the development of new works, as well as nationally recognized and robust educational programming. Creede Repertory Theatre has received many nominations fort its work by the Colorado Theatre Guild&#x27;s Henry Awards including Best New Play, Best Scenic Design, and numerous nominations for individual performances. Creede Repertory Theatre performs in two spaces, its historic Mainstage Theatre (originally a movie house in the 1930s) and the a more modern, flexible space that opened in 2011, the Ruth Humphreys Brown Theatre (The Ruth). Audiences can see shows and events in both spaces during the summer season and in The Ruth in OctoberâApril.

==In popular culture==
Poet and journalist Cy Warman wrote two poems about Creede, &quot;Creede&quot; and &quot;The Rise and Fall of Creede.&quot;

===Ancient Pueblo people===
The Mancos Valley has been settled since at least the 10th century AD, although various severe conditions in the mid to late 13th century saw the area and its multitude of small villages abandoned by the ancient Pueblo people (Anasazi). The Mancos area is dotted with inventoried and uninventoried archeological sites, including both isolated houses and shelters and small village complexes. Mancos Valley residents were probably among those who withdrew to the cliff dwellings on Mesa Verde, perhaps for defensive purposes, due to climate change, or as part of concentration policy of possible invaders and occupiers of the region.

Archaeological sites of the ancient Pueblo period include:
* Bement site, a Colorado State Register of Historic Properties site, representing the first and second Pueblo periods. Between AD 750-850 there was one shelter on the site. About 150 years later, a group of six structures were inhabited from 1000 to 1150.
* Lost Canyon Archeological District, on the National Register of Historic Places, which may have been the northernmost boundary of the Mesa Verde ancient Pueblo people from about AD 1000â1300.

===Native American tribes===

Control of the area was contested by nomadic Navajo and Ute people for centuries. Spanish friars and military passed through the area as part of the Old Spanish Trail connecting New Mexico and California in the 18th century. The name &quot;Mancos&quot; comes from the DomÃ­nguezâEscalante expedition of 1776, though the reason for the name remains unclear (see below). By some unverified accounts, the name Mancos refers to the crippled nature of the Spanish explorers&#x27; horses after they crossed the San Juan Mountains. According to unverified lore, the horses were rejuvenated by the lush green grass in the Mancos Valley. Somewhere in the town is the point at which the expedition crossed the Rio Mancos on its way to California from Old Mexico.

===19th and 20th century===

The Old Spanish Trail trade route passed through the area of Mancos from 1829 into the 1850s.

Part of the original Ute Reservation in 1868, Mancos was part of the San Juan Cession of 1873, and cattle ranchers began settling the Mancos Valley in the 1870s, providing cattle to the mining camps of the San Juan and La Plata ranges. Today, the boundary of the Ute Mountain Indian Reservation is located some south of town. At the time it was founded, Mancos served as the primary commercial trading center for eastern Montezuma County, rivaling the town of Dolores to the northwest. At that time, Cortez, now the county seat, was barely a bend in the wagon trail. In the 1890s, Mancos was platted and built as a stop along the Rio Grande Southern Railroad built by Otto Mears - Colorado&#x27;s southwestern railroad pathfinder, connecting Durango to the east and the Telluride mining districts to the north, via Dolores. Ranchers in the Mancos Valley continued to provide beef, timber, and other agricultural products to the mining camps. Following this, Latter-day Saints colonists moved into the area and established farms and small communities such as Weber and Cherry Creek.

Local farmers and ranchers began constructing irrigation canals to bring water from the Mancos River to cropland and pasture in various parts of the Mancos Valley in the late 1870s and 1880s, and by the beginning of the 20th century a large network of irrigation ditches and laterals was operating and continues to operate (with improvements) today. In the mid-2000s, a large project, the Mancos Valley Salinity Control Project, was funded by various sources, including the US Bureau of Reclamation, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, and local irrigation and water companies and districts. The project, nearly complete in 2010, includes replacing many open irrigation ditches with piping to conserve water and prevent salt contamination from infiltration and evaporation of irrigation water. Many of the original irrigation ditches have been determined to be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, together with various archeological sites.

Incorporated in 1894, Mancos town government quickly asserted itself, banning fast riding and driving (of wagons) in town the next year, as well as building boardwalks. A water system and electrical system were constructed in 1904, followed by a new bridge across the river in 1905 and concrete sidewalks in 1909. However, most side streets of the town remain unpaved. The abandonment of the railroad in the 1950s allowed US 160 to be rerouted to follow the present Railroad Avenue, leaving Grand Avenue, the town&#x27;s main street, as a business route; an earlier route of US 160 is now County Road J, south of the river and most of the town. The establishment of Mesa Verde National Park also encouraged early growth of Mancos.

Several Mancos sites from about the turn of the 20th century are listed on the state or national register of historic places. The first two are on the Colorado State Register of Historic Properties, the remaining are on the National Register of Historic Places:
* The Bauer Bank Building, built in 1905, is the oldest surviving masonry building in the Mancos Valley.
* The Bauer House was built in 1889 for George Bauer, a Mancos pioneer merchant who built the town&#x27;s first store in 1881, a banker, and a stonemason.
* Mancos High School, built in 1909 of local sandstone, was the first high school in the county.
* The Mancos Opera House was completed in 1910.
* The Wrightsman House was built in 1903 of late Victorian architecture.

Attempts to create a separate Mancos County from the eastern portion of Montezuma County in the mid-20th century failed. Agricultural development, and to a certain extent, tourism, benefited from the Mancos Project of the US Bureau of Reclamation in the 1950s, which created Jackson Reservoir north of the town, today the site of Mancos State Park. This project also supplies water for the town, a rural water district, and Mesa Verde National Park.

In recent years the growth of Durango has spread to Mancos, making the town something of an art colony. Aramark, the concessionaire for Mesa Verde National Park, has facilities in the town, and there is a specialty aspen sawmill (Western Excelsior) and other small industrial enterprises. Numerous events are held in the town each year, including Mancos Days the last weekend in July, a motorcycle rally over Labor Day weekend, and a balloon festival in September. Much of the farm and ranch land in the Mancos Valley has been subdivided into rural residential and &quot;hobby ranch&quot; properties in recent years, as is happening in much of Montezuma County. Several major subdivisions immediately adjacent to Mancos are in various stages of development and are expected to greatly increase the town&#x27;s population by 2015, despite some slowdown due to economic conditions. The Mancos Library District constructed a new public library in 2008, located on a former electrical generating station site south of the Mancos River. Most recent new businesses and business activity are occurring outside the corporate limits of the town, in Montezuma County jurisdiction. In 2007â2010, there have been numerous controversial approvals of new commercial developments, including mail-order firms, sand and gravel pits, ready-mix plants and hot-mix asphalt facilities, by the Montezuma County Board of County Commissioners.

==Geography==
Mancos is located in eastern Montezuma County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Mancos has a total area of , all of it recorded as land. The town is located in the Mancos River valley at an elevation of approximately . The Mancos River was named by Spanish explorers (&quot;Rio de los Mancos&quot; - &quot;River of the Sleeve&quot;) perhaps for the way the river, which rises in the La Plata Mountains northeast of Mancos, drains the valley and then flows into the narrow confines of Weber Canyon and Mancos Canyon, southwest of Mesa Verde, where it joins the San Juan River. The town&#x27;s skyline is dominated by the mass of Mesa Verde to the west, Menefee Mountain to the southeast, and the La Plata Mountains, a range to the east and northeast, in which the headwaters of the Mancos River originate.

Originally laid out as a railroad town, Mancos stretches for approximately a mile along the river and on both sides of it, while newer areas lie north of the old railroad alignment (now U.S. Route 160, part of the San Juan Skyway and the Old Spanish Trail). The small main business district lies along Business Route 160 (Grand Avenue), while newer business areas are located along the main highway. The highly publicized death of a schoolchild in 2003 led to a major reconstruction of US 160 through the town in following years, creating a street pattern which somewhat hampers development. US 160 leads west to Cortez, the Montezuma county seat, and east to Durango. Colorado State Highway 184 leads northwest from Mancos to Dolores.

The Mancos River flows from east to west through the town, and then flows to the south into Mancos Canyon, on the west and south toe of Mesa Verde. Much of the townsite is located in a Special Flood Hazard Area (the 100-year floodplain)), including most bridges connecting the two parts of the town.

 northeast of town is Mancos State Park located on Jackson Gulch Reservoir, built by the Mancos Irrigation Project. Echo Basin, a winter (Nordic) skiing area and various vacation resorts and dude ranches, as well as an elk ranch and other tourist-, sports-, and hunting-related activities are located in and around the town.

As is common in Colorado, many government services are provided by special districts, both inside the corporate limits of the town of Mancos and outside in the county. Among these are the Mancos Library District, Mancos Water Conservancy District and Mancos Fire Protection District (which also provides emergency medical services). The nearest hospitals are Southwest Memorial Hospital in Cortez (approximately west) and Mercy Regional Medical Center in Durango, approximately east. The town does have a medical clinic, funded through a variety of private and public sources.

The nearest general aviation and commercial airport is located southwest of Cortez, approximately west of Mancos. There are a few private airstrips in the vicinity of Mancos, but these are not open to the public; a former town airfield near Jackson Gulch Reservoir is sometimes still marked on maps.

<text>Montrose is a home rule municipality that is the county seat and the most populous municipality of Montrose County, Colorado, United States. The city population was 20,291 at the 2020 census, within a total area of 18.5 square miles. The main road that leads in and out of Montrose is U.S. Highway 50.

The city is located in western Colorado, in the Uncompahgre Valley, and is an economic, labor, and transportation waypoint for the surrounding area. Montrose is the second-largest city in western Colorado, after Grand Junction.

==History==
Montrose was incorporated on May 2, 1882, and named after the Marquis of Montrose, immortalized in Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;A Legend of Montrose&quot; by Oliver D. &quot;Pappy&quot; Loutzenhizer and Joseph Selig. The Denver &amp; Rio Grande railroad was built west toward Grand Junction and reached Montrose later in 1882, and the town became an important regional shipping center. A branch railroad line served the mineral-rich San Juan Mountains to the south.

In 1909, the U.S. government completed construction of the Gunnison Tunnel, located east of Montrose. It provided irrigation water from the Gunnison River in the Black Canyon to the Uncompahgre Valley, helping turn Montrose into an agricultural hub. The Uncompahgre Project is one of the oldest of those in the area by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of ; all of it is land.

Montrose is at the south end of the Uncompahgre valley and is built on the Uncompahgre River, which runs to the north, where 60 miles further its waters will join the Colorado River. It is surrounded by, to the north, the widening Uncompahgre Valley and the Grand Mesa, to the east, the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, to the south, the San Juan Mountains, and to the west the Uncompahgre Plateau. The valley is arid, and is only arable due to the water from the Gunnison Tunnel and Ridgway Reservoir.

===Climate===
Montrose features a semi-arid Continental climate zone. The town sits on high grasslands in the Uncompahgre Valley of Western Colorado. Snowfall occurs during the winter but is usually short-lived due to the high elevation and abundant sunshine.

== History ==
The Brush, Colorado, post office opened on September 19, 1882, and the Town of Brush was incorporated on November 24, 1884. Brush was named for Jared L. Brush, who was a Colorado cattle pioneer. Brush had never lived in Brush, Colorado, instead helping to settle what is now known as Greeley. Brush later served as Lieutenant Governor of Colorado and liked to visit &quot;his town&quot; often. An alternative thought for how the town received its name was that in 1883 the town mayor told his councilmen that he would come up with the town&#x27;s name in a fortnight&#x27;s time. Two weeks later, he was approached in his horse stable, and when he was asked what the town shall be named, he looked down at the object he was brushing his horse with and declared it should be called &#x27;Brush&#x27;.

At the height of the mining, Ouray had more than 30 active mines. After changing its name together with the county&#x27;s name several times, the town was incorporated on October 2, 1876, named after Chief Ouray of the Utes, a Native American tribe. By 1877 Ouray had grown to over 1,000 in population and was named county seat of the newly formed Ouray County on March 8, 1877.

The Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railway arrived in Ouray on December 21, 1887. It continued until automobile and truck traffic caused ridership to drop. The last regularly scheduled passenger train was September 14, 1930. The line between Ouray and Ridgway was abandoned on March 21, 1953.

In 1986, Bill Fries, a.k.a. C. W. McCall, was elected mayor, and served for six years.

The entirety of Main Street is registered as a National Historic District with most buildings dating from the late nineteenth century. The Beaumont Hotel and the Ouray City Hall and Walsh Library are listed on the National Register of Historic Places individually, while the Ouray County Courthouse, St. Elmo Hotel, St. Joseph&#x27;s Miners&#x27; Hospital (housing the Ouray County Historical Society and Museum), Western Hotel, and Wright&#x27;s Opera House are within the historic district.

==Geography==
Ouray is located in the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado. It is about south of Montrose. It is only northeast of Telluride, but due to the severity of the landscape, the drive is about . Ouray is connected to Silverton and then Durango to the south by Red Mountain Pass which crests at just over . The drive along the Uncompahgre River and over the pass is nicknamed the &quot;Million Dollar Highway&quot;, although the exact origin of the name is disputed. Yankee Boy Basin is located a few miles from the town.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

=== Climate ===
Ouray is located at an elevation of , and experiences four distinct seasons. Summers are warm in the day and mild to cool at night with brief thunderstorms often occurring in the afternoons in July and August sometimes resulting in intense, though short lived, rainfall. Autumn is cool and mostly clear with occasional rain. Winters are long and coldâthough seldom extremely soâwith considerable snowfall. Spring is generally cool with early spring often bringing the largest snowfalls; late spring into early summer (mid-May through late June) is mild to warm and is usually the driest time of year. The KÃ¶ppen climate classification for Ouray is Dfb.


==Economy==


The majority of Ouray&#x27;s economy is based on tourism. Ouray bills itself as the &quot;Switzerland of America&quot; because of its setting at the narrow head of a valley, enclosed on three and a half sides by steep mountains.

Much of the town tourism is focused on ice climbing, mountain biking, hiking, trail running and off-roading in four-wheel drive (4WD) expeditions into the San Juan Mountains. Ouray has also become a popular destination for motorcyclists, as it marks the beginning of the Million Dollar Highway. This stretch of highway connects Ouray to its neighboring cities of Silverton and Durango. The Million Dollar Highway is frequently regarded as one of the most beautiful roads in Colorado, but is also considered one of the most dangerous due to its sharp turns, steep ledges, and lack of guard rails. Destinations include Yankee Boy Basin, Engineer Mountain, and Black Bear Road. Recording artist (and later Ouray mayor) C. W. McCall helped make Black Bear famous in the area. His song &quot;Black Bear Road&quot; borrowed the phrase, &quot;you don&#x27;t have to be crazy to drive this road, but it helps&quot;, from a sign once posted somewhere at the beginning of Black Bear Pass.

Ouray is a popular destination for ice climbing. The world&#x27;s first ice climbing park, expanding on previously popular natural falls, consists of dozens of frozen waterfalls from 80 to high farmed along more than a mile of the Uncompahgre Gorge. The water is supplied by a sprinkler system developed and maintained by a volunteer organization and supported by donations from local businesses, gear manufacturers and climbers. The Ouray Ice Park is free and attracts climbers from around the world. The annual Ice Festival is a weekend-long extravaganza of contests, exhibitions and instruction with many of the world&#x27;s top ice climbers. Ice climbing has been a boon to the local economy as well, with hotels and restaurants that previously closed through the winter months now staying open to accommodate climbers.

There are five developed hot springs in Ouray and nearby Ridgway. These include thermal pools and vapor caves. Ouray Hot Springs is the largest facility with numerous pools.

There are numerous waterfalls along the road from Durango to Ouray, and within the city limits there are two waterfalls within easy reach. Cascade Falls is a short, 1/4 mile hike accessible from a parking lot on 8th Avenue. Box Canyon Falls is at the southwest edge of Ouray.

Ouray was originally a mining town. The largest and most famous mine is the Camp Bird Mine, the second-largest gold mine in Colorado, established by Thomas Walsh in 1896. Even though there was an operation permit filed in 2007, the mine still remains inactive. During its lifespan, the mine produced about 1.5 million troy ounces of gold, and 4 million troy ounces of silver, from 1896 to 1990. In 1995 the old milling equipment &quot;The Crusher&quot; was disassembled and sold to a smaller mine located in Mongolia where it operated for about two years. The vacant mine can be seen on the steep two-wheel drive road leading to the four-wheel drive roads to Yankee Boy Basin and Imogene Pass.

<text>The Town of Ridgway is a home rule municipality that is the most populous municipality in Ouray County, Colorado, United States. The town is a former railroad stop on the Uncompahgre River in the northern San Juan Mountains. The town population was 1,183 at the 2020 census.

Steep forested mountains and cliffs surround Ridgway on the south, east, and northeast. The Uncompahgre River runs through the town and flows into the Ridgway State Park and Reservoir, to the north. Dallas Creek also flows from the south-west and forms a confluence with the Uncompahgre before entering the reservoir. There is a notable wildlife presenceÂ â mountain lions, badgers, deer, elk, bears, coyotes, wild turkey, and bald eagles are indigenous to the area. The region&#x27;s bald eagles nest in the cottonwoods along the river and are a common sight in the late fall.

Ridgway and the surrounding area have featured prominently in pop culture. Most notably the area is the setting of John Wayne&#x27;s western movie &quot;True Grit&quot;, and others including &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; and &quot;Tribute to a Bad Man&quot;. Ridgway has the only stoplight in Ouray County, at the intersection of Highways 550 and 62.

==History==

Ridgway began as a railroad town, serving the nearby mining towns of Telluride and Ouray.

The town site is at the northern terminus of the Rio Grande Southern Railroad where it meets with Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad running between Montrose and Ouray. Ridgway was located about south of the existing town of Dallas. Articles of incorporation were filed on May 22, 1890, and granted on March 4, 1891. This &quot;Gateway to the San Juans&quot; position was recognized over 100 years ago when the Rio Grande Southern established Ridgway as a railhead center servicing the nearby mining towns of Ouray and Telluride. The town was named for Denver and Rio Grande railroad superintendent Robert M. Ridgway, who established the town in 1891.

The Rio Grande Southern filed for abandonment on April 24, 1952, and the Denver and Rio Grande Western abandoned the line between Ridgway and Ouray on March 21, 1953. The line between Ridgway and Montrose was upgraded from narrow gauge to standard gauge and Ridgway continued to be a shipping point until the line to Montrose was abandoned in 1976 as result of a reservoir being built on the Uncompahgre River.

The dam for that reservoir, the Ridgway Dam, was proposed in 1957 as part of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation&#x27;s Dallas Creek Project, and its original location would have inundated Ridgway. A 1975 decision to put the dam further downstream kept the town above-water, and residents coined their own nickname, &quot;The Town that Refused to Die.&quot; Land around the reservoir became the Ridgway State Park north of town limits. Ridgway is nationally recognized for being âMavericksâ.

==Geography==

Ridgway is situated in the Uncompahgre Valley at an elevation of . The town is located on the San Juan Skyway, cradled in the heart of some of the most photographed mountains in the world. The nearby San Juan Mountain Range has 14 of Colorado&#x27;s 53 peaks over 14,000 feet. Among them, Mt. Sneffels is most prominent from Ridgway. The eponymous Mt. Ridgway, in height, is also nearby, west of Ouray. To the east of the town also lies the smaller but equally-grand Cimarron Range, with Uncompahgre Peak at .

The Uncompahgre River flows from Lake Como at in northern San Juan County, in the Uncompahgre National Forest in the northwestern San Juan Mountains is the headwaters of the river. It flows northwest past Ouray, Ridgway, Montrose, and Olathe and joins the Gunnison at Confluence Park in Delta. The river forms Poughkeepsie Gulch and the Uncompahgre Gorge. The major tributaries are all creeks draining the northwest San Juan Mountains. There are two dams on the Uncompahgre River, a small diversion dam in the Uncompahgre Gorge, and Ridgway Dam below Ridgway, which forms Ridgway Reservoir.

The river is used for irrigation in the Uncompahgre Valley. The Uncompahgre is unnavigable, except at high water. The name given to the river comes from the Ute word Uncompaghre, which loosely translates to &quot;dirty water&quot; or &quot;red water spring&quot; and is likely a reference to the many hot springs in the vicinity of Ouray. Lake Otonawanda is the primary source of Ridgway&#x27;s municipal water.

Ridgway is 37 miles east of Telluride and 10 miles north of the Ouray. The area is also set at the base of the San Juan Mountains providing excellent views especially when viewed from Log Hill Mesa.

===The Grammy Awards===
The Grammy Award trophy is hand crafted exclusively by John Billings (the &#x27;Grammy Man&#x27;) and his team of craftsmen at Billings Artworks in Ridgway. The trophies are all hand cast in an alloy called grammium, then hand filed, ground and polished before being plated in 24k gold.

===Certified Colorado Creative District===
In 2011, in collaboration with Ouray County and the City of Ouray through numerous public meetings and pursuant to a request from the State of Colorado for a &quot;Bottom Up&quot; Economic Development Plan, a county-wide economic development plan was created. Goal 3 of this plan called for participation in statewide efforts to grow and nurture creative industries as an economic development driver for the State. The Goal 3 (&quot;G3&quot;) committee was formed and approached the Ridgway Town Council for support and leadership in submitting an application to become a certified Creative District with the State. The City of Ouray, Ouray County and Town of Ridgway volunteers all agreed that the Town of Ridgway would be the applicant for District certification in 2012. 15 awards were issued through Colorado Creative Industries, and Ridgway was one of 5 districts awarded Prospective District status.

The Ridgway Creative District was awarded Prospective Creative District status in 2012 under the State of Colorado legislation, House Bill 11â1031, signed into law by Governor Hickenlooper in 2011. After a year as a Prospective District, on June 26, 2013, Colorado Creative Industries and the Boettcher Foundation announced that the Ridgway Creative District had achieved State-Certified Creative District Designation.

===The Sherbino Theater===
The Sherbino/Cherbeneau/Charbonneau family have been a part of Ridgway since before Ridgway was even incorporated. And their local legacy â &quot;The Sherbino â still plays a major role in downtown Ridgway today.&quot; In 1877, Louis Sherbino purchased several lots in downtown Ridgway from Samuel Wade. Louis, who was born in Canada but was working in the timber mills in Michigan, moved to Lake City, then Rico, then Colona and finally Ridgway in the late 1800s. On May 21, 1915, rumors that had been circulating were confirmed, as Louis presented an application to the town for permission to erect a &quot;pressed brick veneered building&quot; on Clinton Street and a 6&#x27; sidewalk along the Cora Street side. &quot;The building turned out to be a theater designed by Gus Kullerstrand of Ouray and it opened to much fanfare on Saturday, September 11, 1915.&quot; The newspaper coverage from September 17 says, &quot;Close to 400 people took in the event, all parts of the country being represented by a goodly number of persons. The lineup of rigs and automobiles in front of the building gave the town a citified look.&quot; The article went on to mention there was seating for 300, running hot and cold water, and toilets! What is now the Colorado Boy Brewery was part of the theater at the time, accounting for the reported amount of space for seating. The Sherbino family ran the theater for less than a year as another local built a &quot;motion picture business&quot; and most people went there.

The Sherbino building went on to be used as a community center. Local residents gathered there in 1917 to learn that the US had entered WWI. In 1924, many local residents who had come into the region by wagon in the 1870s were invited to the Sherbino to view the movie &quot;The Covered Wagon&quot; which commemorated the adventuresome spirit that lead them here. Since the Sherbino opened, folks have gathered to enjoy Chautauqua-style entertainment such as orchestra performances, melodramas, plays, traveling troupes, and educational events. The building has played host to graduations, public meetings, and was used as a roller rink and (for at least one night) a boxing arena. The exterior had a bit part in the 1968 original movie True Grit that included a false porch built onto the addition on rear of the building. At some point the original interior was split into 2 sections. The section with the original doorway (now Colorado Boy&#x27;s entrance) served as the post office, a drug store, and the Colorado Yurt Company headquarters. The building interior underwent major renovations in the 1970s, again in the early 1990s, and again in 2018. In August 1991 the Sherbino received designation on the Colorado State Register of Historic Places.

With the support of many local residents, The Ridgway Chautauqua Society (RCS, a Colorado non-profit 501c3) is now a proud owner and steward of two of Ridgway&#x27;s remaining historic structures - the remodeled Sherbino at 604 Clinton Street, and The 610 Arts Collective at 610 Clinton Street, next door.

===Water===
Water plays an important part of local Ridgway culture. The town maintains a marina in a northern inlet of the Ridgway Reservoir. During the warm summer months many tourist and locals take advantage of the Ridgway Reservoir, often wakeboarding or enjoying a day at its beach.

The town also features &quot;Orvis Hot Springs&quot;, a clothing-optional, natural-hot-springs resort near Ridgway with an indoor, clothing-required pool.

<doc id="108612" wikidata="Q604196" url="?curid=108612" title="Alma, Colorado">
<text>Alma is a statutory town in Park County, Colorado, United States. The town population was 296 at the 2020 United States Census. Alma is located West and South of the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Front Range Urban Corridor.

==Description==
At an elevation of , Alma is the highest incorporated municipality in the United States when considering only areas with permanent residents. Its post office is located at the highest elevation of any in the country. Alma, which is considered a town and not a city, does not take the title of &quot;highest incorporated city&quot; from Leadville, Colorado. Using administrative boundaries as a measure, not settled areas, in 2006 Winter Park, Colorado became the highest incorporated town due to its annexation of a ski area. Beyond the official limits of Alma is a residential area which extends to above sea level on Mountain View Drive; this area uses Fairplay, Colorado addresses, despite being slightly closer to Alma.

==History==
The town was named by a merchant named Mr. James, after his wife. Another tradition states the town was named for the daughter of a resident.

The Alma, Colorado Territory, post office opened on March 7, 1873, and the Town of Alma was incorporated on December 2, 1873. Colorado became a state on August 1, 1876.

In February 1998, local resident Thomas Leask murdered a former mayor and damaged town buildings, costing the town at least , a prohibitive amount for Alma&#x27;s municipal finances.

===Mines===
Alma grew as a town around the Buckskin Gulch, where gold was first discovered in the area. As hard rock mines opened on Mount Bross, Mount Lincoln, and Mount Democrat, the population of the area continued to grow. In the 1870s, Alma&#x27;s population peaked at around 10,000 people. The area around Alma contains 17,452 mining sites, mostly placer mines.

Approximately two miles from Alma are the remains of the defunct Orphan Boy mine (founded 1861), which produced gold, silver, lead, and zinc over a number of decades.

The historic Sweet Home Mine near Alma, formerly a silver mine, now produces the mineral rhodochrosite.

==Geography==
Alma is located along State Highway 9.

At the 2020 United States Census, the town had a total area of including of water.

===Climate===
Alma has what could be called a subalpine climate due to its elevation. Summers are pleasant, with mild days and chilly nights. The wettest months are July and August due to thunderstorm activity. Spring and Autumn are both short, but pleasant overall with cool days and cold nights occasionally reaching below freezing. Winters are cold and snowy, lasting from the end of October to well into April some years. Winter highs are almost always below freezing and lows remaining around zero for 1/3 of the year. Alma&#x27;s snowpack is usually established during October or November. Alma&#x27;s high elevation and location helps to limit both extreme minima and maxima. April averages the most snowfall out of any month of the year.

==History==
A historic gold mining settlement, the town was founded in 1859 during the early days of the Pike&#x27;s Peak Gold Rush.

It is on a hillside just east of the Middle Fork South Platte River, near where Highway 9 ascends the river valley northward to Alma and Hoosier Pass. It is a quiet town, and the roads surrounding it have a low volume of traffic. Although it was founded during the initial placer mining boom, the mines in the area continued to produce gold and silver ore for many decades up through the middle of the 20th century.

The town consists of modern retail businesses along the highway, as well as a historic town on the bluff above the river along Front Street. The northern extension of Front Street along the river has been preserved and has become the site of relocated historic structures as an open-air museum called South Park City, intended to recreate the early days of the Colorado Gold Rush. Most of the residences in town are located on the hillside west of US Highway 285 and east of State Highway 9, in the vicinity of the schools and Park County Courthouse. The majority of the streets in town were finally paved in 2005.

==Arts and culture==
=== Burro Days ===
The Burro Days festival is held on the last weekend of July. The event celebrates the town&#x27;s mining heritage. The main feature of the festival is a 29-mile (46.7Â km) burro race over rough terrain and approximately 3,000-ft (914 m) elevation gain from downtown Fairplay to the 13,185-ft (4019 m) summit of Mosquito Pass. Teams consist of one person and one burro. The race takes about five hours to complete; first prize is $1,000. Previously, the first prize included an ounce of gold. There are several other burro races in Colorado; the most notable takes place in Leadville.

The Fairplay event is the World Championship of Burro Racing, an ultra-marathon and the longest burro race in the state. For many years (in the 1960s and early 1970s) the Burro race took place from Leadville to Fairplay, or vice versa, crossing over Mosquito Pass. This followed the route that Father John Lewis Dyer of the Methodist Episcopal Church used for circuit riding and for carrying mail. With time, the rivalry between the two cities ended this cooperative endeavor.

<doc id="108617" wikidata="Q2004309" url="?curid=108617" title="Snowmass Village, Colorado">
<text>Snowmass Village is a home rule municipality in Pitkin County, Colorado, United States. The population was 3,096 at the 2020 census. A popular winter resort location for skiing and snowboarding, the town is well known as the location of the Snowmass ski area, the largest of the four nearby ski areas operated collectively as Aspen/Snowmass. In 2010, the accidental discovery by a bulldozer operator of fossilized elements of a Pleistocene ecosystem in the ice age lake bed at the Ziegler Reservoir (commonly referred to as the Snowmastodon site) put Snowmass Village prominently on the paleontological map of North America.
==History==
The Brush Creek Valley was settled &quot;circa&quot; 1910 by ranching families including: Sinclair, Melton, Stapleton, and Hoaglund. As a child, Hilder Hoaglund would ride her horse into Aspen to go to school. Her father, Charles Hoaglund, immigrated from Sweden in the 1800s. After a school was built in Brush Creek valley, she attended the Brush Creek Frontier School, now called the Little Red Schoolhouse, located on Owl Creek Road. She became a teacher at that school and then at the Red Brick School in Aspen. At the schoolhouse, she played the accordion or piano for community dances. When she married Bill Anderson, the Hoaglund Ranch became the Anderson Ranch.

Paul Soldner, a ceramic artist noted for developing American Raku, established a studio in the Anderson Ranch buildings in 1966. He founded the Anderson Ranch Arts Center and incorporated it into a non-profit in 1973. The Anderson Ranch Arts Center on Owl Creek Road uses many of the original buildings from the Hoaglund Ranch, although not in their original location, farther down stream on what is now Snowmass Club Circle.

Under the leadership of Bill Janss and DRC Brown, the American Cement Company developed Snowmass Village as a ski resort starting in 1966. * Hayfields were subdivided and the lots sold for houses. Brush Creek is an unappealing name for a ski area, so they named the resort Snowmass after the valley to the west of Brush Creek. Fritz Benidict acted as the architect of the Snowmass ski area. The Campground Chairlift serving the western edge of the ski area, actually does extend into the Snowmass Valley. Five chairlifts were installed: Fanny Hill, Burlingame, and Sam&#x27;s Knob, the Big Burn, and Campground.

The Snowmass ski area first opened on December 16, 1967. The new ski area hired Olympic medalist Stein Eriksen to direct the ski school. Besides experience as a skier and instructor, Stein Eriksen brought an aura of European glamor to the raw new resort.

Brush Creek Road was paved in 1968. The former hayfields still had mostly alfalfa into the 1970s. The Snowmass Golf Course was first laid out with nine holes in (need date). It was expanded and redesigned several times (need dates), the latest in 2001 by James Engh. The periodic re-landscaping of the golf course led to the relocation of ranch houses and to changes in the valley floor from flat or sloping fields to rolling hills with ponds.

The Snowmass Wildcat Fire Protection District was founded in 1971 and the firehouse built on Owl Creek Road.

Notorious serial killer Ted Bundy abducted and murdered Caryn Campbell in Snowmass Village on January 12, 1975. Her body was later found along the Owl Creek road near what is now the Facilities Maintenance Division.

In 1977, the community incorporated as the Town of Snowmass Village.

The Snowmass Chapel was built near the firehouse on Owl Creek Road in 1988. Previous to this time, church services were held in the Opticon Movie Theater or in the open air Aspen Grove Chapel, where benches were set up under aspen trees separating two ski runs. Later the area was cleared for more condominiums off Wood Road.

Today, Snowmass Village has experienced a building boom, as new condominiums, luxury homes, mountainside mansions, and Base Village have recently been constructed. Westin Hotels and the Viceroy Hotel Group have recently built a respective hotel in Snowmass. Snowmass Village is also experiencing a rising influx of wealthy tourists and skiers.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (0.35%) is water.

Snowmass Village is to the north and at the base of the Snowmass Ski Area. It is located on Brush Creek, not Snowmass Creek. Within the area of the town, Owl Creek and Brush Creek join and then flow north into the Roaring Fork River.
Visible from the village from east to west are Burnt Mountain Ridge, Burnt Mountain, Baldy Mountain, Chapel Peak, Garret Peak, Clark Peak, Mount Daly, and Capitol Peak. Neither Snowmass Mountain nor Snowmass Peak, at the headwaters of Snowmass Creek, are visible from Snowmass Village.

The geologic unit Mancos Shale underlies most of the area. On slopes too steep for vegetation, this shale is visible as gray expanses of eroding bedrock. On south-facing slopes, the alkaline soil that develops from the shales supports Gambel oak, sagebrush, serviceberry, and chokecherry. The north-facing slopes feature aspen, subalpine fir, Douglas fir, Engelmann spruce, and blue spruce.

The area around Snowmass Village has abundant wildlife including black bears which feed on the acorns and berries of the south-facing slopes.

==History==
The town of Mace&#x27;s Hole was settled in 1862. The town was named for Juan Maes, anglicized to &quot;Mace,&quot; a bandit who used the valley for a hideout. The Mace&#x27;s Hole, Colorado Territory, post office opened on April 23, 1873, and Colorado became a state on August 1, 1876. A local preacher took umbrage at the town&#x27;s name and suggested the biblical name Beulah as a more wholesome alternative. The Mace&#x27;s Hole post office was renamed Beulah on October 25, 1876. The name is a reference to Isaiah 62:4; it comes from the Hebrew for &quot;married.&quot;

Bishop Castle, constructed by Jim Bishop, otherwise known as a &quot;one man castle&quot;, is located between Beulah and San Isabel, Colorado.

<text>Pueblo West is a census-designated place (CDP) in and governed by Pueblo County, Colorado, United States. The CDP is part of the Pueblo, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population of the Pueblo West CDP was 33,086 according to the United States Census 2020. The Pueblo West Metropolitan District provides services. The Pueblo post office serves Pueblo West postal addresses.

==History==

The area that is now known as Pueblo West was undeveloped rangeland before Robert P. McCulloch, land developer and oil magnate, and his company McCulloch Properties, Inc. came to Colorado. Historically occupied by Ute and Comanche people, most recently the land was used for ranching, supported by the water from the Arkansas River. Inspired by the neighboring City of Pueblo, Colorado, and the momentum of successfully creating Lake Havasu City, Arizona, McCulloch, and his company was formally founded in the Pueblo West Metropolitan District (the District) on September 16, 1969. Shortly after the creation of the District, McCulloch built the Pueblo West Inn, where guests were treated to a luxurious experience to sell land in the rolling prairies of the new community. The Pueblo West News, the District&#x27;s first newspaper, reported by 1974, over 2,000 new residents had moved into Pueblo West, and Pueblo School District 70 founded Pueblo West Elementary with 200 students enrolling in the fall. In 1977 McCulloch Properties pleaded guilty to criminal fraud for largeâscale land sales misrepresentation and was forced to refund dissatisfied customers.

Since the 1970s, recreational and industrial opportunities were also being founded on Pueblo West property, including the South Equestrian Center, National Horseman&#x27;s Arena, the Pueblo West Golf and Tennis Club, and manufacturing company Aspen Skiwear, all making use of the area&#x27;s expansive plains for their ventures. Pueblo West had a population of nearly 4,500 by the early 1980s, requiring the building of Pueblo West Middle School. With developmental opportunities abounding in the North Industrial Park, the economy of the District was growing alongside its residential areas. Following a population boom in the 1990s, several new elementary schools were built, with Pueblo West High School officially opening in 1996. In the early 2000s, a trail system was created along with an additional fire station being built to serve the north side of the District. Pueblo West also entered into the Southern Delivery System, a bilateral agreement to supply water from the Pueblo Reservoir to Colorado Springs. Today, Pueblo West is home to over 30,000 residents and boasts a growing industrial center.

In January 2019, the Pueblo West Metro District Board initiated a feasibility study regarding incorporation.

==Geography==

Pueblo West is approximately 49 square miles in size and is located along the southern edge of the state&#x27;s major growth corridor. Situated on Highway 50, roughly 7 miles west of the City of Pueblo and 38 miles east of CaÃ±on City, Pueblo West is bisected by U.S. Route 50, and its northeastern border is adjacent to Interstate 25. Lake Pueblo State Park is situated along the southern boundary of Pueblo West, and the remainder of the community is mostly landlocked by ranch land, conservation easements, and private property.

The Pueblo West CDP has an area of , including of water.

===Climate===
(All temperature ranges given are in Fahrenheit degrees)

Pueblo West, located in Southern Colorado, boasts nearly 300 days of sunshine a year. While the temperature tends to be mild and dry, monsoon years can bring higher amounts of rain and cooler summer temperatures. According to the national weather service, the record high summer rainfall for this area was 14.64 inches in 1921, while the record low rainfall was less than an inch during the Dust Bowl in 1939. The 30 year average for summer precipitation is just over 5 inches.

Spring temperatures can fluctuate greatly during the day, with the average highs for March, April, and May typically registering from the 50s to the mid 70s. However, in some years late spring snow storms can dump inches of snow, sometimes in a matter of a few hours. Some years might see light snowfall well into May. Nighttime lows typically range from the 20s to the 40s for these months. Pueblo West is rather windy in general, and particularly windy in the spring.

In the summer, high temperatures typically start out in the 80s-90s range, but can quickly reach 100 or higher. However, the evenings are pleasantly cool, with the average summer low evening temperature being in the 50s to 60s, although occasionally temperatures can drop down into the upper 30s even during the summer.

Fall is often crisp and very dry. September, October, and November typically start out in the 80s and fall through the 70s to reach high temperatures in the 50s during November, although, depending on the year, October or even September can sometimes see the first snowfall. Lows for this time period tend to move from the 50s down into the upper 20s. Frequently these months will also become windier and can exacerbate Red flag warnings for wildfires. Campers and hikers should be aware that campfires are frequently prohibited during these months.

The winter months of December, January, and February see average highs in the 40s and 50s with lows in the 20s. Milder winter temperatures also mean less snowfall, with a yearly average snowfall of 31 inches.

==Recreation==

Lake Pueblo State Park offers fishing, boating, water skiing, hiking, horseback riding, and mountain biking opportunities. Other major attractions, such as the Royal Gorge Bridge and Park, Monarch Mountain, and the Historic Arkansas Riverwalk of Pueblo, are nearby.

==Government==
The Pueblo West Metropolitan District operates one of the leanest local governments in Colorado and provides services to over 30,000 residents, businesses, and visitors. As a special district form of government, Pueblo West exists to provide services in an unincorporated portion of Pueblo County and is not considered a city. This classification recognizes Pueblo West as a quasi-municipal local government governed by Title 32, Article 1 of the Colorado Revised Statutes. Pueblo West was formed to perform local government functions outlined in the District&#x27;s service plan. These services include covenant enforcement, fire protection, parks and recreation, public works, and water and wastewater utilities. Law enforcement, planning and zoning, and court services are provided by Pueblo County. In addition, services such as the Health Department, Regional Building Department, and the Pueblo West Library are provided by partnerships between the City of Pueblo and Pueblo County.

The District is governed by a five (5) member Board of Directors, who are elected by registered voters consisting of Pueblo West residents and property owners. Elections for board members occur in May of even years and alternate between two (2) seats and three (3) seats.

Pueblo West lies within Colorado&#x27;s 3rd U.S. Congressional District. For representation in the Colorado General Assembly, Pueblo West is located in the 46th and 47th districts of the Colorado House of Representatives and the 3rd districts of the Colorado State Senate.

===Taxes===

Property taxes serve as the District&#x27;s primary method of raising general fund revenue, with miscellaneous fees and grants covering the remainder. In 2015, Pueblo West generated $4,337,155 in revenue from property taxes and $1,757,287 in miscellaneous taxes. As an unincorporated special district, Pueblo West is limited in its ability to generate the revenue needed to provide necessary services to its growing population. Of the 3.9% sales tax collected in Pueblo West, 2.9% goes to the State of Colorado, while the remaining 1% goes to Pueblo County.

In November 2015, Pueblo West voters passed a ballot initiative asking for an excise tax on the first transfer of cultivated recreational marijuana within Pueblo West.

In November 2016, Pueblo West voters passed ballot initiative 5A, asking for a Tax Payers Bill of Rights (TABOR) timeout to fund the design, construction, and maintenance of a new community pool and aquatic facility. The TABOR time-out will sunset in 2026.

<text>Meeker is a statutory town in and the county seat of Rio Blanco County, Colorado, United States, that is the most populous municipality in the county. The town population was 2,374 at the 2020 United States Census.

==Description==
The town is largely a ranching community, located in the wide fertile valley of the White River in northwestern Colorado. Relatively isolated from other communities, it sits near the intersection of State Highway 13 and State Highway 64, on the north side of the White River and at the base of a long ridge, known locally as China Wall. The Bureau of Land Management has a regional office in the town. Meeker is the home of the annual Meeker Classic Sheepdog trials.

==History==

The town is named for Nathan Meeker, the United States Indian Agent who was killed along with 11 other white citizens by White River Ute Indians in the 1879 Meeker Incident, also known as the Meeker Massacre. The site of the uprising, the former White River Indian Agency, is located along State Highway 64 in the White River valley west of town and is marked by a prominent sign. None of the buildings remain.

Meeker was the first incorporated town in Northwestern Colorado and is the County seat for Rio Blanco county. The town was incorporated in 1885 and became the central hub of banking and trade in Northwestern Colorado for several generations.

After the uprising and the ensuing conflict known as the Ute War, in 1880 the US Congress passed legislation requiring the Ute population to relocate to reservations in Utah. The United States Army established a garrison on the current site of the town, called the Camp at White River. The town was founded in 1883 following the removal of the troops. The White River Museum is located just north of the Rio Blanco County Courthouse and housed in several original wooden structures of the Army garrison.

The town emerged as a regional center for hunting by the turn of the 20th century. Theodore Roosevelt visited the town twice in 1901 and in 1905 on a mountain lion and bear hunting trip and stayed in the historic Hotel Meeker opposite the courthouse. The town is also a favorite summer destination and permanent residence for many prominent Americans, including billionaires Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York, Henry Kravis, former president and COO of Goldman Sachs Jon Winkelried, and comedian Daniel Tosh.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land. The town is situated on the White River at an elevation of 6,250 feet above sea level.

<text>Rangely is a statutory town in Rio Blanco County, Colorado, United States. The population was 2,299 at the 2020 census. Rangely is the home of Colorado Northwestern Community College.

==Description==
The town is home to one of two campuses of the Colorado Northwestern Community College.

A post office called Rangely was established in 1884. The community was named after Rangeley, Maine, the native home of a local businessperson.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.

The terrain is mountain desert and is dry for most of the year.

===Climate===

According to the KÃ¶ppen Climate Classification system, Rangely has a cold semi-arid climate, abbreviated &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps. The hottest temperature recorded in Rangely was on June 21, 1974, while the coldest temperature recorded was on February 15, 1895, and January 2, 1952.

==History==
The land is what makes the town of Rangely&#x27;s interesting. The land is the base from which all human events unfold, whether it is the geology that brought the miners and oil men, or the water that brought the Fremonts, the Utes, the explorers, the ranchers.

To tell the story we must start back in the earlier history of the earth when a shallow sea encompassed most of the area around, 300 million years ago in what is labeled as the Pennsylvanian Period. and Permian geologic periods. During this time marine creatures would become fossils and can actually still be discovered around Rangely. Huge dunes were formed on the edges of this sea and became porous rock that is now known as the Weber Formation. This formed what is called an &quot;anticline.&quot; An anticline is a ridge-shaped fold of stratified rock in which the strata slope downward from the crest. Then, as the sea receded, dinosaurs left bones and the extensive plant growth became oil and coal.

The innumerable canyons, draws, and gullies of the area held creeks, rivers and streams which attracted the early Fremont and Ute peoples. The Fremont people migrated to the Rangely area from the Great Basin in south-central Utah between 400 B.C. - 650 A.D. What we know about the Fremont comes from the artifacts they left in the area and from their homes and campsites which we find in the nearby canyons. Evidence of the Fremont people is plentiful in and around Rangely; for example, the rock art on Colorado 139 and Dragon Trail are both examples of Fremont Art. A Fremont dwelling in Texas Creek Overlook was an atypical dwelling for the Fremont people.

In many places around Rangely the art echoes images from other sites in the southwest. The art of the historical Utes records their history of conflict with the white settlers who began moving into the area in the 1800s. Their art is also the first to include horses originally brought by the Spanish.

The first recorded white settlers making a permanent home in the area were Mr. Joseph Studer and C.P. Hill who came in 1882, the same year the Ute people were to be confined to reservations in southern Colorado and eastern Utah. Some time later Mr. Hill was joined by his relatives, among them a cousin, Lee S. Chase, who named the town after Rangeley, Maine. Mr. Hill began ranching and opened a trading post. All supplies were freightedâfirst from Salt Lake City, Utah, by team and wagon, then from Grand Junction, Colorado, via Douglas Pass. By 1913 there were enough ranching and farming families in the area to necessitate the building of a large one-room school house (now located in the Rangely Outdoor Museum.)

Interestingly, the Utes had long been aware of oil in the area. The first shallow wells drilled in 1903 produced about 10 barrels of oil per day. Chevron arrived in 1931. In 1932, after a year of drilling Raven A-1, the first deep oil well, successfully reached the vast pocket of crude in the Weber formation at a depth of more than 6,000 feet, but there was no market for the 230 barrels it produced each day; however, the well was known as the most productive oil well of all time. The well was capped until everything changed for this sleepy little town with the large demand for oil required during the Second World War. Chevron reopened the Raven A-1 well and Rangely became a booming oil camp.

By 1946 raising cattle and sheep, farming, shallow oil well drilling, and mining coal were no longer the principle industries. Deep well drilling was king. Tents, trolley cars, crude cabins and trailers took over the dozen homes. The one store, post office, filling station, library, pool hall, Red Cross first aid station, and hotel suddenly had competition from a slew of businesses, including motels, cafes, bars, cleaners, movie theater, bowling alley, and more. The school had been accredited up to three years of high school with senior year taken elsewhere, usually Meeker, or forfeited. Company camps were built in many places in the valley, and in 1947 Rangely was incorporated as a town with Fred Nichols voted in as Mayor. In the 1960s the Rangely oil field was a major producer in the country and deemed such an important strategic asset that bomb shelters were built at the college and supplied with coats, blankets, food and water.
By 1949 there were 478 wells across 30 miles in the Weber formation. The peak rate of the area was 82,000 by 1956. Rangely&#x27;s oil field was known as the Rangely Weber Sand Unit by 1998 and recovered more than 815 million barrels of oil, making it the largest field in the Rocky Mountain Region. This Region has 406 producing wells, 351 injection wells and produces about one third of Colorado&#x27;s oil production coming out to a huge 20,000 barrels a day. The Weber Basin, has recovered an additional 12 million barrels of oil from the shallower Mancos Shale at depths less than 2000 feet. The Sand Unit is a unitized field so is owned by many, but only Chevron USA Production operates the field. Major oil companies, smaller independent oil companies, trust and individuals numbering almost 30 share the expenses and the benefits of the field today. The Unit provides jobs for approximately 300 individuals and makes up about 70 percent of the property tax revenue for Rio Blanco County.

In 2015, Colorado Northwestern Community College, Rangely Campus, began the excavation of an important fossil dig of the bones and very rare skin and tendons of a Duckbill Dinosaur which was located in Rangely. The Duckbill Dinosaur, which ultimately took on the name of Walter, was excavated and the fossils were airlifted to a federal repository on Colorado Northwestern Coummunity College&#x27;s Craig Campus on Thursday, July 11, 2019.

<doc id="108633" wikidata="Q1850407" url="?curid=108633" title="Del Norte, Colorado">
<text>Del Norte is a Statutory Town that is the county seat of Rio Grande County, Colorado, United States. The town&#x27;s name is most commonly pronounced /ËdÉl nÉÉ¹t/. The town population was 1,458 at the 2020 United States Census.

==History==
Del Norte is named from the river Rio Grande del Norte, or &quot;large river of the north&quot;. There is abundant evidence in the area in the form of arrowheads and campsites of ancient peoples living around Del Norte thousands of years ago, such as the Folsom people. Afterwards, the Utes were known to live around Del Norte and the rest of the San Luis Valley, going back hundreds of years prior to Euro-American contact. They lived here temporarily in the warmer months because of the abundance of wild game, plants, water, and timber in the area â winters were often too cold and harsh for them to settle permanently. Spanish and Mexican peoples were the first non-natives to explore the nearby land, coming from Santa Fe and other parts of New Mexico. They were interested in surveying the &#x27;Rio del Norte&#x27;, or &#x27;River of the North&#x27; â hence the origin of the town&#x27;s name. This was the original name of the Rio Grande headwaters prior to numerous name changes over the years.

Under Mexican jurisdiction, Hispanic families began moving into the area during the early to mid-19th century as part of land grants to help the Mexican government fill and occupy the territory. However, large-scale settlements were difficult to establish because the Utes were weary and very hostile towards Euro-American settlement, and would chase off many people who attempted to do so. The most successful early settlement nearby was called &#x27;La Loma&#x27;, established a few miles east of where the current town site is today. This area was chosen because there was a particular section of the Rio Grande here where it could be crossed safely and easily â one of few known for miles during this time. After the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo was signed in 1848, jurisdiction of the land in and around Del Norte transferred from Mexico to the United States, but settlement by Americans in the area was delayed by civil strife (including the American Civil War) throughout the 1850s and 1860s. Most American settlements began in the area around the early 1870s, by prospectors searching the nearby mountains for minerals, such as gold and silver, particularly near an eventual boom-town named Summitville, located at the base of South Mountain near Bennett Peak.

These peaks in the San Juan Mountains were some of the last parts of Colorado where miners were allowed to explore and prospect for minerals, and they were finally able to do so after the Brunot Treaty was signed between the U.S. government and the Utes in 1873. Once the mines proved profitable, Del Norte was officially established around 1874, in order to serve as a base camp for the mines, not just in Summitville, but also in nearby Creede and Lake City. Miners quickly moved into the area, and they were followed by ranchers and farmers. Many of these original farming and ranching families still have operations and live in the Del Norte area to this day. After the Sherman Act was repealed in 1893, mining operations quickly became unprofitable and ceased. The &#x27;glory days&#x27; of Del Norte ended as quickly as they began, but the community still survived because of ranching and agriculture. There was a small movement across southern Colorado throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s to secede from the State of Colorado and create the state of San Juan, with Del Norte becoming its capital city; however, this secession movement died quickly.

Del Norte would see cycles of boom and bust throughout the 20th century, but has recently become a blossoming community, due to the abundance of recreational activities provided by the area&#x27;s unique geography, such as mountain biking, hiking, running, rock climbing, fishing, hunting, rafting and kayaking, cross country skiing, camping, etc. Del Norte is also one of the communities which provides lodging for the nearby Wolf Creek Ski Area. Grande Avenue, the main street through Del Norte, still has many of the facades on its storefronts from the 1800s and early 1900s, reminding its residents and tourists of the town&#x27;s historic past. In 2019, the Rio Grande National Forest announced that it will be moving its headquarters from nearby Monte Vista to Del Norte, and the town announced that it will be improving its riverwalk to include a white-water park along the Rio Grande.

==Physical geography==

Relatively-speaking, it is located where the Rio Grande leaves the San Juan Mountains and enters the San Luis Valley, near its confluences with Pinos Creek and San Francisco Creek, respectively. Due to its location on the western edge of the valley, a variety of climates, vegetation regions, and ecosystems transition into each other at or around Del Norte. Within a twenty mile radius of the town, from alpine tundra, montane forests, to high-altitude desert. Common vegetation around Del Norte ranges from coniferous pine trees, deciduous aspen trees and cottonwoods, to sagebrush and cacti. During the warmer months of the year, hollyhock, cosmos, poppies, and sunflowers are frequently found around the town. Lookout Mountain (also known to locals as &#x27;D&#x27; Mountain) overlooks the town, and is perhaps its most notable landmark. The classification of &#x27;mountain&#x27; has been a misnomer, considering that &#x27;D&#x27; Mountain has a mild prominence from the rest of the town (approximately 591 feet), and that there is nearby terrain with much greater prominence; however, the classification has stuck since early settlement.

At the 2020 United States Census, the town had a total area of , all of it land.

===Climate===

Like most places in the San Luis Valley, Del Norte is generally categorized in a semi-arid or a high-altitude desert climate. Precipitation is the main factor that determines this classification year-to-year, as it can fluctuate from as many as 10-12 inches annually in a wetter year, to 6 inches or less during a drought year. One reason precipitation varies greatly year-to-year is because the town is located in a rain shadow created by the San Juan Mountains. Because of this, precipitation is often determined by how strong and intense storm fronts are, and how these fronts move across the area. This explains why Wolf Creek Ski Area, located about 28 miles west of town, receives on average over 400 inches of snow per year, while Del Norte receives about 10% of that amount â about 40 inches of snow annually. Most precipitation falls in the form of rain or snow; hail and sleet are uncommon, but not unheard of. In general, one can expect in Del Norte to experience mild summers and cold winters, with spring and autumn varying between these. Springtime in the area generally includes gusty winds, and many of the year&#x27;s strongest snowstorms actually happen during this season. Summer monsoons can hit the area as well, beginning in July and continuing through the end of September. During summer monsoons, the area generally experiences sunny mornings with clouds and storms moving in during the afternoon, and varying amounts of precipitation ranging from light drizzles of rain to brief, torrential downpours. Like most of Colorado, night time temperatures can drop quickly and intensely, because of the dry climate and the lack of moisture in the air.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 1,705 people, 657 households, and 446 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 736 housing units at an average density of .

<text>South Fork is a statutory town in Rio Grande County, Colorado, United States. It lies at the confluence of the South Fork and Rio Grande rivers. The population was 510 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==History==
South Fork was once the site of timber milling operations.

South Fork was founded in 1882, by which date its location was already marked by the presence of a coaching post, dating from the construction of the railroad connection of the Rio Grande Western Railroad line to Creede, which had been built to support the Creede silver mine. It was only in 1992 that South Fork achieved independent statutory town status, making it the youngest statutory town in the state. Originally the principal economic activities involved forestry and mining, but in recent decades these have been overtaken in the employment statistics by tourism.

South Fork made Colorado headlines during the Summer of 2020 when its town board announced that solicitations for donations was unlawful within town limits. This was in response to a local farmer&#x27;s market in which one of its vendors was asking people for donations to the Black Lives Matter movement and the NAACP.

==Popular Culture==
South Fork&#x27;s Riverbend Resort was the filming location of fictional &#x27;Kamp Komfort&#x27; in the 1983 hit movie &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot;.

==Demographics==
South Fork has about 600 permanent residents, but a substantially larger summer population due to seasonal residents and visitors.

<text>Steamboat Springs is a home rule municipality that is the county seat and the most populous municipality of Routt County, Colorado, United States. The population was 13,224 at the 2020 census. Steamboat Springs is the principal city of the Steamboat Springs Micropolitan Statistical Area, and it is the largest city in northwestern Colorado.

The city is a winter ski resort destination, including the Steamboat Ski Resort on Mount Werner in the Park Range just east of the town and the much smaller Howelsen Hill Ski Area. Steamboat Springs has produced more athletes for the Winter Olympics than any other town in North America.

Steamboat Springsknown colloquially as &quot;The Boat&quot;is located in the upper valley of the Yampa River, along U.S. Highway 40, just west of the Continental Divide and Rabbit Ears Pass. It is located approximately 150 miles northwest of Denver, and sits approximately 45 miles south of the Wyoming border. It is served by Steamboat Springs Airport (general aviation) and commercial service at nearby Yampa Valley Airport.

== History ==


The area surrounding Steamboat Springs was originally inhabited by the Yampatika band of the Utes, who hunted in the valley during the summer. Trappers began to move through the area during the first decades of the 19th century. James Harvey Crawford, the founder of Steamboat Springs, first arrived in the spring of 1874. The Crawford family moved there in 1876, and for the first five years were the sole permanent white residents of the town. The native Utes were forcibly removed from the area to a reservation in Utah by the U.S. Army starting in 1879. Milestones in the development of the pioneer town included the first sawmill in 1873, incorporation of the town in 1900, and the arrival of the railroad in 1909. The economy of the region was originally based on ranching and mining, which still have a large presence in the county.

Steamboat is home to several natural hot springs that are located throughout the area (see Geography). Upon first hearing a chugging sound, early trappers believed that a steamboat was coming down the river. When the trappers saw that there was no steamboat, and that the sound was coming from a hot spring, they decided to name the spring Steamboat Spring.

Originally, skiing was the only method of transportation during harsh and snowy Rocky Mountain winters. In turn, the popularity of skiing as a winter pastime catalyzed development of the town and other communities all over the Rocky Mountains. In 1913, Carl Howelsen, a Norwegian, moved to town and introduced ski jumping. Howelsen built the first jump on Howelsen Hill, now part of the Howelsen Ski Area. He also founded the annual Winter Carnival, a celebration still held each winter. The festival includes ski racing and jumping, dog sledding, and chariot events down Lincoln Avenue, the city&#x27;s main street. Light shows on both Mount Werner and Howelsen Hill are highlights. Howelsen also founded the Steamboat Springs Winter Sports Club and built the town&#x27;s first ski jumps. The oldest continually operating ski area in North America, Howelsen Hill, now bears his name and is one of just three complete ski jumping complexes in the United States.

The Steamboat Ski Resort was largely established by two local men, Jim Temple and John Fetcher. Temple led the effort to develop the area. Fetcher, a local rancher, was the main designer and builder. The resort opened on what was then called Storm Mountain in 1963.

In 1974, The Industrial Company (TIC) was started in Steamboat Springs and has since grown into one of the largest industrial construction companies in the United States with revenues of approximately $2 billion in 2007. The company is one of the largest employers in Routt County and has more than 9,000 employees worldwide.
TIC - The Industrial Company was acquired by Kiewit Engineering and all operations except the Training Center moved elsewhere (Denver, etc.).
The main TIC complex on Routt County Road 129 has been acquired by Yampa Valley Electric Association as their new headquarters, with extensive renovation. This property provides ample areas for offices, vehicle maintenance, and construction laydown activities.

In 1993, the City Council of Steamboat Springs, Colorado, conducted a poll of its residents to choose a new name for the bridge that crossed the Yampa River on Shield Drive. With 7,717 votes, the winning name was &quot;James Brown Soul Center of the Universe Bridge&quot;. The bridge was officially dedicated in September 1993, and James Brown appeared at the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the event.

The Yampa Valley and surrounding area contain several geothermal hot springs. The city is named after the Steamboat Spring, located near the present-day library and the old train depot. The spring itself was so named because its bubbling sounded like a steamboat to early settlers.

Steamboat Springs is served by Steamboat Springs School District RE-2.

The city is also home to the Steamboat Springs campus of Colorado Mountain College. CMC Steamboat Springs is notable for being the only college in the United States offering a degree in Ski &amp; Snowboard Business, which focuses on the retail, manufacturing, and marketing of snowsports.

== Sports ==

Steamboat Springs offers skiing opportunities and has been the locale for skiing competitions including the 1989 and 1990 Alpine Skiing World Cup.

The Yampa river is a location for water sports like fishing, rafting, tubing, and kayaking (playboating). The grade II-III whitewater run through town ends with two surfable holes. One is called &quot;D-Hole&quot;; the other oneânear the library, close to the Steamboat Springâis named &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Hole&quot; or &quot;C-Hole&quot; for short, after local kayaker Charlie Beavers (1981â2002). Beavers started kayaking at age 12, was the first to explore a number of rivers (&quot;first descents&quot;), and successfully contended in playboating competitions. He died in a non-boating accident in 2002. The hole and some kayaking events were dedicated to him.
Every year on the first weekend of June, Steamboat Springs organizes the &quot;Yampa River Festival&quot;. It includes a kayak rodeo (i.e., a playboating competition) which attracts national and international world class playboaters. Additional events include, but are not limited to, a downriver race which is Colorado&#x27;s only upstream slalom race, and the Crazy River Dog Contest, in which dogs retrieve sticks from the river and may pass a whitewater section.

The defunct ski area Stagecoach is about south of Steamboat. It lasted two ski seasons, closing in 1974.

<text>Saguache ( ) is a Statutory Town in and the county seat of Saguache County, Colorado, United States. The population was 539 at the United States Census 2020.

==History==
Saguache is a small historical village in an agricultural area in southern Colorado at the northern gateway to the San Luis Valley, a valley between the Sangre de Cristo Range on the east and the San Juan Mountains to the west. Saguache Creek flows through the town from its beginnings high in the San Juan mountains. The site has been known for centuries to Native Americans who moved down from their summer homes in the mountains to the valley during the winter months. The Spanish began to move into the area in the 1600s and Spanish sheepherders passed through each year as they drove their flocks into the hills for summer grazing. Later the early white settlers and miners passed through this area, many seeking passage west along the Old Spanish Trail. In the mid-1860s, the first permanent white settlements were established in Saguache and the nearby town of Villa Grove. Saguache County was officially founded in 1866.
The formation of the town was influenced by the occupations and needs of the era. Beginning as a trading post, in the late 1800s mining became a significant influence as the Colorado mining boom brought hundreds of mining operations to the surrounding mountains and the miners needed a steady supply of food and other goods.

The town was founded by Otto Mears, who came to Saguache in 1867. Mears constructed a wheat thresher and a grist mill for thrashing and grinding wheat to make flour to supply Saguache and the surrounding mines. He also built toll roads over the nearby mountain passes to use for hauling supplies to mining camps to the north, and to further open the area to settlement. The Saguache Town Company was formed in 1874 turning Saguache into a booming supply town. Mears also established a newspaper, the Saguache Chronicle, to attract pioneers to Saguache. Mears later helped build the Million Dollar Highway.

===Today===
From its early days as a boom town, the population of Saguache has shrunk to around 500 residents. The Saguache visitor guide writes that &quot;In its heyday, Saguache could boast of having the Colorado Hall (serving the purest wines and liquors), the Saguache Meat Market, a boarding house, a grocery, law firms, a hardware store, a hotel, a sawmill, and &quot;The Saguache Chronicle&quot; newspaper.&quot; After several name changes, &quot;The Saguache Chronicle&quot; eventually became &quot;The Saguache Crescent&quot;. The paper is printed every week on a flatbed press built in 1915 with metal type cast on a Linotype composing machine. The Linotype may be the only one still in use in the United States. It is also still the county&#x27;s &quot;paper of record,&quot; and is operated by a third generation descendant of the family who purchased it in 1917.

The early sheep ranching eventually gave way to cattle and alfalfa hay production. Present-day Saguache has &quot;one school, a library, a museum, four churches, two gas stations, one liquor store, two grocery stores, two restaurants, a sawmill, and an organic farm.&quot;

===Name===
According to a 2013 &quot;Denver Post&quot; article entitled, &quot;What&#x27;s in a Colorado name pronunciation?&quot;, the name &quot;Saguache&quot; (pronounced ) comes from a Ute language word meaning &quot;sand dune&quot;. A Native American, Naranjo, explains the history of the name: &quot;The Utes don&#x27;t have an alphabet. The way the immigrants heard it, the way you hear it, is how they spelled it. The word is &#x27;sÉ wÅ­p;&#x27; it means &#x27;sand dunes.&#x27; But the immigrants couldn&#x27;t pronounce it, so they called it &#x27;sÉ wÃ¤ch.&#x27; &quot;

But according to a 1995 letter to the editor of the &quot;Colorado Central Magazine&quot;, the name Saguache means &quot;Blue earth â water at the blue earth.&quot; The writer had written to correct an article in which the word was said to mean &quot;green place&quot;, but according to the writer, the word comes from a shortened form of the Ute language word &quot;Saguaguachipa.&quot; The Ute tribe encampments were common in the area around the present-day community and the name &quot;referred to springs in which blue earth was said to be found to the north&quot;. The Editors replied: &quot;The Ute Dictionary, published in 1977 by the Southern Ute Indian Tribe of Ignacio, Colo., defines &quot;sagwa-ci&quot; [diacritical marks omitted] as &quot;&#x27;Saguache&#x27;, lit. &#x27;green place&#x27;; name of a town in the San Luis Valley in So. Colorado ...&quot; One source states that the &quot;blue earth&quot; mentioned refers to a deposit of blue clay found near the creek.

The Colorado State Historical Society has a different take on the meaning: The note on a community monument: Saguache, &quot;the name derived from the Indian word `Blue Water&#x27;.&quot;

The Spanish language version of this name is usually spelled &quot;Saguache&quot;, while the English language version is usually spelled &quot;Sawatch&quot;.

==Geography==
Saguache is served by U.S. Route 285 and Colorado State Highway 114. Saguache Creek flows past to the southwest of the community.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.

==Attractions and recreation==
As the gateway to the San Juan Mountains, home to the Rio Grande National Forest and the La Garita Wilderness Area, Saguache offers outdoor activities such as sightseeing, cycling, hiking and camping. Highway 114 to Cochetopa Pass follows the original Old Spanish Trail, offering high country scenery and access to large tracts of public lands.

Saguache has a small museum. According to the information they provide:
In a tribute to our forebears and in keeping with the work ethic embedded from our agricultural heritage, this Museum has won acclaim from visitors all over the United States, and many foreign countries.
The museum provides information related to convicted cannibal Alferd Packer, who served time in the Saguache County Jail. On February 9, 1874, Alferd Packer and five other men departed from the camp of Ute Chief Ouray, near what is now Montrose, Colorado, prospecting for gold. The party was soon stranded in a blizzard near Lake City and nothing was seen of them until April, when Packer came out of the mountains alone. Packer gave several conflicting stories about the fate of the other men, but finding his stories dubious he was jailed in Saguache where he remained until August, when he escaped. By coincidence, on the day of Packer&#x27;s escape from the Saguache jail, the remains of the missing prospectors were found with evidence of foul play and cannibalism. He was eventually found in Wyoming; he was returned and tried in Lake City. Found guilty, he was sentenced to 40 years and was paroled after serving 17. He died in 1907 and by all accounts had been &quot;a model citizen&quot; for his remaining years.

Due to the nature of the crime, at the time it was sensationalized and well-covered throughout the nation, and it remains a well-known incident locally in Colorado. The area where the bodies were discovered is now known as Cannibal Plateau.
Packer is remembered in Lake City by holding an annual Alferd Packer Jeep Tour and Barbecue. The cafeteria in the University of Colorado, Boulder, student union is called the Alferd Packer Memorial Grill.

The museum displays a figure of Packer sitting in a cell with the sheriff guarding the prisoner from his chair in his office. On display are handcuffs, leg irons and other items relating to the history of Alfred Packer.

<doc id="108643" wikidata="Q679125" url="?curid=108643" title="Silverton, Colorado">
<text>Silverton is a statutory town that is the county seat, the most populous community, and the only incorporated municipality in San Juan County, Colorado, United States. The town is located in a remote part of the western San Juan Mountains, a range of the Rocky Mountains. The first mining claims were made in mountains above the Silverton in 1860, near the end of the Colorado Gold Rush and when the land was still controlled by the Utes. Silverton was established shortly after the Utes ceded the region in the 1873 Brunot Agreement, and the town boomed from silver mining until the Panic of 1893 led to a collapse of the silver market, and boomed again from gold mining until the recession caused by the Panic of 1907. The entire town is included as a federally designated National Historic Landmark District, the Silverton Historic District.

Originally called &quot;Bakers Park&quot;, Silverton sits in a flat area of the Animas River valley and is surrounded by steep peaks. Most of the peaks surrounding Silverton are thirteeners. The highest being Storm Peak, at 13,487 feet. The town is less than 15 miles from 7 of Colorado&#x27;s 53 fourteeners, and is known as one of the premier gateways into the Colorado backcountry.

Silverton&#x27;s last operating mine closed in 1992, and the community now depends primarily on tourism and government remediation and preservation projects. Silverton is well known because of the Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad, a former mine train that is now a National Historic Landmark, and internationally recognized events such as the Hardrock Hundred Mile Endurance Run. The town population was 622 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
=== Mining era ===


Settlements in the area surrounding present-day Silverton began in 1860 after a group of prospectors led by Charles Baker made their way into the San Juan Mountains searching for gold. The area was soon referred to as &quot;Baker&#x27;s Park&quot;, and the group found traces of placer gold nearby.

Long before settlement, the area was regularly explored by the Anasazi, and later the Utes, who hunted and lived in the San Juans during the summer. There is also speculation that Spanish explorers and fur traders ventured into the area before Baker&#x27;s 1860 expedition.

After the Brunot Agreement with the Utes in 1873, which exchanged for the Southern Ute Indian Reservation and $25,000 per year, several mining camps were constructed. These would later become the communities of Howardsville, Eureka, and Silverton.

Silverton was founded by mining entrepreneurs William Kearnes, Dempsey Reese, and Thomas Blair in 1874. The region boomed after George Howard and R. J. McNutt discovered the Sunnyside silver vein along Hurricane Peak. Gold was then discovered in 1882, which helped the region weather the Panic of 1893 far better than other mining communities, such as Aspen or Creede. The Sunnyside Mine would become one of Colorado&#x27;s longest running and most productive mines. The mine was shut down after the 1929 stock market crash, but was acquired by Standard Metals Corp. in 1959, and reopened, finding gold in 1973 with the Little Mary vein. The region&#x27;s economy was dealt a devastating blow in 1992 when the mine and the corresponding Shenandoah-Dives mill, the last operating in the region, permanently closed. The closure meant the end of jobs for over one third of Silverton&#x27;s workforce.

=== Tourism era ===
The town has a long history of tourism and efforts to market tourism by the Silverton Commercial Club (now the Chamber of Commerce) dates back as early as 1913. By the 1930s, interest in the âOld Westâ was already attracting tourists from around the world, for which the newly constructed U.S. Route 550 further enabled access. Tourism continued to increase in the latter part of the 20th century, but Silverton&#x27;s harsh winters and isolation made it a summer-only attraction. Following the closure of Sunnyside, Silverton lost much of its tax base as the town&#x27;s population dwindled to just over 500, a quarter of its peak population one hundred years earlier.

The town&#x27;s scenic narrow-gauge railroad, originally built by the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad (later renamed the Denver and Rio Grande Western or D&amp;RGW) primarily to haul ore to Durango, became popular as a tourist attraction, and this traffic increased after World War II when the line was featured in several popular western films and its staff began actively promoting tourism. As mining and other rail freight declined, the D&amp;RGW petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1960 to abandon the line, but the petition was denied due to the strong tourist traffic. In December 1968, the D&amp;RGW discontinued service on its AlamosaâDurango line west of Antonito, Colorado, and formally abandoned the line in 1969, severing Silverton&#x27;s only remaining connection to the national rail network. The SilvertonâDurango line now served tourists exclusively, and in 1980, the D&amp;RGW sold it to an independent operator who renamed it the Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad (D&amp;SNG). Operations continue today, bringing several trainloads of tourists to Silverton daily during operating season, and the D&amp;SNG also operates a museum in the town.

The town&#x27;s population, buoyed by strong summer tourism and an emerging winter economy, has since recovered. The construction of the expert-level ski area Silverton Mountain in 2002 marked the beginning of Silverton&#x27;s year-round tourism. Another ski area, the Purgatory Resort, is marketed as being within the Durango Metropolitan Area but is actually closer to Silverton than it is to Durango. Winter festivals such as Skijoring have brought crowds that rival those in the summer, and the potential for new winter activities such as the expansion of the town-operated ski hill could permanently improve Silverton&#x27;s winter tourism. The town has also become well known for its winter backcountry activities such as snowmobiling, ice climbing, and backcountry skiing.

Both the town and the rail line were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961. In 1966, the entire town was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. These boundaries were expanded in 1997 with the addition of the Shenandoah-Dives mill and other historical structures. The town&#x27;s only grocery store is the Silverton Grocery &amp; Deli, formerly called the Greene Street Grocery.

=== Notable disasters ===
The area surrounding Silverton has been the scene of several well-documented disasters, many of them due to avalanches and mining accidents.

==== 1906 avalanches ====
Five miners perished in a slide at the Sunnyside mine in January 1906. Only a few months later, twelve miners were killed in another slide at the Shenandoah Mine, making it one of the most deadly slides in the history of Colorado.

==== 1918 influenza pandemic ====
The Spanish Flu arrived in Silverton near the end of October 1918, and quickly devastated the community. In a single week, 125 people, more than 5% of the town&#x27;s population, perished from flu complications. By the time the pandemic waned the following March, 246 people had died, accounting to more than 10% of the population. This gave Silverton the dubious honor of having the highest mortality rate for the Spanish Flu in the entire nation.

==== Lake Emma disaster ====
On June 4, 1978, when the water from Lake Emma collapsed into Sunnyside mine, shooting out of a portal with a force that toppled a 20-ton locomotive. Fortunately, no injuries were reported as disaster occurred on a Sunday when nobody was present in the mine.

==== Gold King Mine disaster ====
In 2015, the EPA and its contractors caused an environmental catastrophe when they accidentally destroyed the plug holding water trapped inside the Gold King Mine, which caused three million US gallons (eleven thousand cubic meters) of mine waste water and tailings, to flow into a tributary of the Animas River.

<text>Julesburg is the statutory town that is the county seat and the most populous municipality of Sedgwick County, Colorado, United States. The population was 1,307 at the 2020 United States Census.

==History==
The original trading post was named for Jules Beni. Julesburg was on the Pony Express (1860â1861) route from Missouri to California.

===Jack Slade===
In 1858, Joseph A. &quot;Jack&quot; Slade, a superintendent for the Central Overland California and Pikes Peak Express Company, was tracking down horse thieves, including Jules Beni. Slade caught up with him at Julesburg, but Beni shot him five times. Everybody thought that Slade was dead and several angry townsfolk chased Beni out of Julesburg. When they returned, they found Slade struggling to his feet, having miraculously recovered.

Beni continued to steal horses from the Pike&#x27;s Peak Express Company, and Slade vowed to hunt him down. Beni attempted to ambush Slade at Slade&#x27;s own ranch at Cold Springs. But Slade found out about the planned ambush and, along with some of his cowboys, captured Beni. Slade did not take Beni to authorities but instead shot him dead while he was tied to a fence post. He shot off each of his fingers, and then put the gun in Beni&#x27;s mouth and pulled the trigger. Afterward, he severed Beni&#x27;s ears as trophies. 

This account is among the &quot;Stories of the Century&quot;, a syndicated television series starring and narrated by Jim Davis, which aired on March 4, 1955. Gregg Palmer (1927â2015) played the role of Slade, and Paul Newlan (1903â1973) portrayed Beni.

===Battle of Julesburg===

Julesburg was a large and prominent stagecoach station and the site of Fort Rankin (later Fort Sedgwick). In revenge for the Sand Creek Massacre, one thousand Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Lakota warriors attacked Julesburg on January 7, 1865. In the battle the Indians defeated about 60 soldiers of the U.S. army and 50 armed civilians. In the following weeks the Indians raided up and down the South Platte River valley. On February 2 they returned to Julesburg and burned down all the buildings in the settlement, although not attacking the soldiers and civilians holed up in the fort. At the time, the town was said to have had over 1000 buildings.

==Geography==
Julesburg is located at (40.988422, â102.266677). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.

The town is located on the north side of the South Platte River, along U.S. 138 and U.S. 385 and just off of I-76. It is the northernmost town in the state, less than south of the ColoradoâNebraska state line.

===Climate===
Julesburg experiences a semi-arid climate (KÃ¶ppen &quot;BSk&quot;) with cold, dry winters and hot, wetter summers.

==Demographics==


==Education==
Julesburg School District operates public schools.

==In media==
Julesburg was featured in the 1960 episode &quot;The Story of Julesburg&quot; of the syndicated television series &quot;Pony Express&quot;. It was the setting of the 1959 Randolph Scott film, &quot;Westbound&quot;. &quot;Julesburg&quot; is the title of the second episode (1955) of the ABC western &quot;Cheyenne&quot;. A 2019 YouTube video by VOA News features Julesburg as the backdrop for a short documentary about Charmaine Teodoro, a math teacher from the Philippines who is currently working at Julesburg High School.

==History==
===Name===
The first prospectors in the area built a stockade known as Fort Mary B named after Mary Bigelow, who was the only woman in the party. The town of Breckenridge was founded in November 1859 and named for prospector Thomas Breckenridge. General George E. Spencer persuaded the citizens to change the spelling of the town&#x27;s name to Breckinridge in honor of U.S. Vice President John Cabell Breckinridge in the hopes of gaining a post office. Spencer succeeded in his plan and on January 18, 1860, the Breckinridge post office became the first U.S. post office between the Continental Divide and Salt Lake City. Thirty days after John Breckinridge accepted a commission as a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army on November 2, 1861, the loyal Union town changed its name back to the original Breckenridge on December 2, 1861.

===Discovery===

Prospectors entered what is now Summit County (then part of Utah Territory) during the Pikes Peak Gold Rush of 1859, soon after the placer gold discoveries east of Breckenridge near Idaho Springs. Breckenridge was founded to serve the miners working rich placer gold deposits discovered along the Blue River. Placer gold mining was soon joined by hard rock mining, as prospectors followed the gold to its source veins in the hills. Gold in some upper gravel benches east of the Blue River was recovered by hydraulic mining. Gold production decreased in the late 1800s, but revived in 1908 by gold dredging operations along the Blue River and Swan River. The Breckenridge mining district is credited with production of about one million troy ounces (about 31,000 kilograms) of gold.
The gold mines around Breckenridge are all shut down, although some are open to tourist visits. The characteristic gravel ridges left by the gold dredges can still be seen along the Blue River and Snake River, and the remains of a dredge are still afloat in a pond off the Swan River.

Notable among the early prospectors was Edwin Carter, a log cabin naturalist who decided to switch from mining to collecting wildlife specimens. His log cabin, built in 1875, still stands today and has been recently renovated by the Breckenridge Heritage Alliance with interactive exhibits and a small viewing room with a short creative film on his life and the early days around Breckenridge.

Harry Farncomb found the source of the French Gulch placer gold on Farncomb Hill in 1878. His strike, Wire Patch, consisted of alluvial gold in wire, leaf and crystalline forms. By 1880, he owned the hill. Farncomb later discovered a gold vein, which became the Wire Patch Mine. Other vein discoveries included Ontario, Key West, Boss, Fountain, and Gold Flake.
The Town of Breckenridge was incorporated on March 3, 1880. The Breckenridge Heritage Alliance reports that in the 1930s, a women&#x27;s group in Breckenridge stumbled upon an 1880s map that failed to include Breckenridge. They speculated that Breckenridge had never been officially annexed into the United States, and was thus still considered &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;. This was completely falseâofficial US maps did include Breckenridgeâbut these women created an incredibly clever marketing campaign out of this one map. In 1936 they invited the Governor of Colorado to Breckenridge to raise a flag at the Courthouse officially welcoming Breckenridge into the unionâand he came. There was a big party, and the entire event/idea of Breckenridge being left off the map made national news. The &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; idea later morphed into a new theme of Breckenridge being referred to as &quot;Colorado&#x27;s Kingdom&quot;, and the theme of the town&#x27;s independent spirit is still celebrated to today during the annual &quot;Kingdom Days&quot; celebrations every June.

In December 1961, skiing was introduced to Breckenridge when several trails were cut on the lower part of Peak 8, connected to town by Ski Hill Road. In the ensuing decades, the ski area was gradually expanded onto adjacent peaks, with trails opening on Peak 9 in the early 1970s, Peak 10 in 1985, Peak 7 in 2002, and Peak 6 in 2013.

On November 3, 2009, voters passed ballot measure 2F by a nearly 3 to 1 margin (73%), which legalized marijuana possession for adults. The measure allows possession of up to an ounce of marijuana and also decriminalizes the possession of marijuana-related paraphernalia. Possession became legal January 1, 2010. Possession was still illegal by state law, however, until the passage of Colorado Amendment 64 in 2012.

During the Great Depression, Denver Water began acquiring land around Dillon. In 1956, residents and business owners in Dillon were notified that they would need to sell their property and move out, because Denver Water was about to begin construction on a dam just downstream from the town, and the resulting reservoir (which would help supply water to Front Range communities) was going to flood Dillon and the surrounding valley. About a mile to the north and approximately higher in elevation, some land on a hillside was set aside for the current townsite, which is now situated on the shoreline of Dillon Reservoir.

<doc id="108656" wikidata="Q2303176" url="?curid=108656" title="Montezuma, Colorado">
<text>The Town of Montezuma is a statutory town located in eastern Summit County, Colorado, United States. The town population was 74 at 2020 United States Census. The town is a former mining camp that sits at an elevation of , just west of the Continental Divide, nestled among mountains that reach an elevation of 12,000-13,000 feet (3,700-4,000 m) around it. It is situated in the upper valley of the Snake River above the ski resort of Keystone in the Rocky Mountains.

==Description==
The town, which is named for Montezuma, the Emperor of the Aztecs, consists largely of historical buildings and houses lining unpaved streets at the end of the paved county road that ascends the Snake River from Keystone near the west side of Loveland Pass. The town sits in a high steep valley surrounded by forested peaks offering good access to higher national forest land destinations. The paved road up from Keystone leads mainly through national forest right up to the entrance of town, which is marked by a sign over the county road.

The town retains many older structures, some of them dating from the late 19th century, such as the picturesque school house dating from the 1880s, now a State of Colorado Historical Site. The town is often included in lists of ghost towns in the Colorado Rockies, but it nevertheless retains a small population of full-time residents, as well as many absentee homeowners.

From 2004 until 2009, a small low-powered FM station (KMZM 96.5 then 96.7), which was receivable only near and in the town, operated from one of the houses.

Montezuma has some of the most popular backcountry skiing, biking, snowmobiling, snowshoeing and hiking trails in Summit County. Montezuma is listed as one of Colorado&#x27;s top scenic places in John Fielder&#x27;s Best of Colorado.

==History==

The town was founded in 1865 following the discovery of silver in the vicinity of nearby Argentine Pass. It was populated by prospectors coming over the passes from nearby Georgetown. The town was incorporated in 1881. A local newspaper, the Montezuma &quot;Mill Run&quot;, began publishing in 1882. In its inaugural issue, the &quot;Mill Run&quot; described the town as having two hotels, three stores, three saloons, two blacksmiths, one shoemaker, and a number of restaurants and boarding houses.
In 1890, at the height of the Colorado Silver Boom, the population reached nearly 10,000. At the time, the town had two stores, a post office, two hotels (the Summit House and the Rocky Mountain House), and a sawmill. It eventually had a smelter, as well, which allowed local separation of the silver and lead ores, which are typically found together in the region. At the town&#x27;s peak, the mountainside around the town was location of numerous mines on the Belle and Blance lodes, operated by the Sts. John Mining Company, after which the nearby ghost town of Saints John is named. Saints John now consists of three cabins near timberline, at 10,764 feet.

The town experienced a steep decline after the Silver Bust in 1893. It experienced a slight revival in mining interest in 1940, but has remained fairly quiet since World War II. The town has experienced five major fires throughout its history, including ones in 1949 and 1958 which destroyed many of the historic structures, including the Summit House, which burned in the fire of Christmas 1958. Other fires in the 1970s and 1980s destroyed additional historic buildings and businesses, leaving the town with little current economic base. Presently, the town is experiencing a high surge of interest as the value of real estate in proximity to ski areas and with access to wilderness increases substantially.

==Geography==
At elevation, the town is among the few (perhaps just four) incorporated towns or cities in the United States at elevation higher than.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.

===Climate===
Montezuma has a subarctic climate (Dfc) with short, mild summers and long, cold winters.

==Demographics==

The average household size was 2.10 and the average family size was 3.33.

<text>The Town of Silverthorne is a home rule municipality in Summit County, Colorado. According to the 2020 Census, the population of the city is 4,402.

==History==
The town was named for Judge Marshall Silverthorn who served as the judge of the miners&#x27; court in Breckenridge. The judge first came to town as a prospector and claimed a section of the Blue River in 1881. After patenting his claim in April 1882, he was disappointed to find the gold to be sparse and the claim a poor bet. The land passed to his daughters on his death in 1887 and was then sold several times to various mining companies. In 1953 Clayton Hill bought the property and subdivided it for homes and stores.

Silverthorne served as a makeshift camp for workers during the construction of the Dillon Reservoir from 1961 to 1963, and later as a stop along Interstate 70. It was eventually incorporated on April 5, 1967.

The city has expanded several times since incorporation by annexation.

Since 2016, the town of Silverthorne has hosted the Silverthon Games, an annual competition featuring a seasonally-based slate of individual and team events, culminating with the heavily spectated Hummingbird Circle race.

==Geography==
Silverthorne is situated between the Gore Range to the west and the Continental Divide to the east. The two most visible mountains are Buffalo and Red Mountains. Also surrounding the valley are Ptarmigan, Tenderfoot, and Ten Mile Peaks.

<text>The City of Victor is a Statutory City in Teller County, Colorado, United States. Gold was discovered in Victor in the late 19th century, an omen of the future of the town. With Cripple Creek, the mining district became the second largest gold mining district in the country and realized approximately $10 billion of mined gold in 2010 dollars. It reached its peak around the turn of the century when there were about 18,000 residents in the town. Depleted ore in mines, labor strife and the exodus of miners during World War I caused a steep decline in the city&#x27;s economy, from which it has never recovered. The population was 379 at the 2020 census. There is a resumed mining effort on Battle Mountain.

==History==

===Gold discovery===
Victor was founded in 1891, shortly after Winfield Scott Stratton discovered gold nearby. The town was named after the Victor Mine, which may have been named for an early settler, Victor Adams. In 1892, Harry, Frank and Warren Woods founded the Mt. Rosa Mining, Milling and Land Company. Battle Mountain, located just above Victor, had the largest, most prolific mines in the mining district and the town became known as the &quot;City of Mines.&quot; Victor officially became a city on July 16, 1894. In 1894, the Woods brothers discovered gold when they began digging the foundation for a building, which resulted in the creation of the Gold Coin Mine. At that time, 8,000 people lived in Victor.

The town boomed as the surrounding Cripple Creek mining district quickly became the most productive gold mining district in Colorado. Mines in Victor and Cripple Creek provided 21 million ounces of gold. In 2010, the value of the gold would have been more than $10 billion. The mining district, which hit its peak in 1900, became the 2nd largest gold district in the country&#x27;s history.

Although Victor&#x27;s fame was overshadowed by that of its neighbor, Cripple Creek, many of the best gold mines of the Cripple Creek district were located at Victor, including Stratton&#x27;s Independence Mine and Mill and the Portland Mine. Half of Battle Mountain&#x27;s gold was extracted by the Portland Mine, which was called the &quot;Queen of the District&quot;. Heavyweight boxing champion William Harrison &quot;Jack&quot; Dempsey was a mucker in the Portland Mine.

Mine owners and investors lived in Cripple Creek, while most of the miners for the districts&#x27; 500 mines lived in Victor.

===Fire of 1899===
In August 1899, the business district was destroyed in a five-hour fire. The town had about 18,000 residents at the time. As a result, many of the historic buildings date to 1899, including the St. Victor Roman Catholic church, the First Baptist Church of Victor, and the Victor Hotel.

===Unionized workforce===

The Western Federation of Miners (WFM) began to organize workers in a fight for shorter work days and standard wages. The workforce became heavily unionized after the Western Federation of Miners conducted a significant strike in 1894. A subsequent strike in 1903 had such an impact that it came to be called the Colorado Labor Wars. At this point, the amount of available ore to mine had declined significantly and mining in the district was further impacted by slow production as the result of violent strikes.

The WFM&#x27;s union hall in Victor still stands, with telltale bullet holes left intact. The building has structural problems and needs renovation.

===Mining decline===
The town declined steadily in the 20th century, as the gold mines became worked out, and the cost of mining rose relative to the price of gold (fixed at $20.67/troy ounce). Area miners enlisted during World War I, and the loss of workers created a steep decline in mining activity from which the area has not recovered.

Gold mining increased in 1934 when the federal government raised the price of gold to $34/ounce, but gold mining was shut down during World War II as nonessential to the war effort. Some mines opened after the war, but all mines in the district closed by 1962.

===Resumed mining activity===
The Cripple Creek &amp; Victor Gold Mining Company formed in 1976 as a joint venture to restart mining in the district. From 1976 to 1989, the company produced 150,000 troy ounces (4,600Â kg) of gold by reprocessing tailings and mining two small surface deposits. The Cripple Creek &amp; Victor Gold Mining Company began the first large-scale open pit mining in the district in 1994. In 1995, an open pit gold mining operation, which taps into &quot;legendary&quot; mines, began on Battle Mountain. The Cresson mine open pits are located a few miles north of Victor. Mining continues at the Cripple Creek &amp; Victor Gold Mine, under the ownership of AngloGold Ashanti, producing about 250,000 troy ounces of gold in 2012,
in addition to several locally owned mines, all of which provide employment and revenue for the community. Ownership has recently changed from Anglo Gold to Newmont mining.

===Museums and other points of interest===
Victor is in the heart of Colorado&#x27;s gold country, home to two of the major gold mines in the Cripple Creek mining district. Though the goldrush-era mines are closed, near the center of town the fortress-like remains of a wrought iron-gated mine entrance, shaft elevators (which carried the miners down), mine carts (now employed by the town as flower planters), barred tunnels, two outbuildings (an office overlooking the entrance and the building from which the miners set out), and other sites of interest from that era still stand. Several towering &#x27;gallows frames&#x27;, which house the antique elevator pulleys, can be seen on the hillsides. Victor has many mining and history related attractions:
* Gold Coin Mine
* Lowell Thomas Museum
* Victor Hotel
* Victor Downtown Historic District, including the active First Baptist Church

Victor also lies along the Gold Belt Tour National Scenic and Historic Byway.
===Arts festival===
&quot;Victor Celebrates the Arts&quot; is a judged painting contest held on Labor Day weekend, which began in 2000.

===Photography book===
A 2015 book, &quot;City of Mines&quot;, by Anderson &amp; Low (), depicts the buildings and scenery around the town without showing the people.

=== World Record Home Run Distance Attempt ===
In 2022, youtubers The Baseball Bat Bros attempted to break the Guinness World Record for Longest home run hit, set by Babe Ruth in 1921 with a verified measurement of 575 feet. The attempt was made at The Gold Bowl baseball and soccer field. Victor, having one of the highest elevations in the United States was an ideal location as thinner air at high elevations creates less drag on a traveling baseball than at lower elevations, thus allowing it to travel farther in the air. Various high school, college, and former professional baseball players were invited to attempt to break the record but none were successful with elevated land beyond the outfield and unfavorable winds likely spoiling the attempts. The longest home run hit on the day was an estimated 534 feet.

==Education==
Students are served by the Cripple Creek-Victor Junior/Senior High School.

<doc id="108659" wikidata="Q2009757" url="?curid=108659" title="Woodland Park, Colorado">
<text>Woodland Park is a home rule municipality in Teller County, Colorado, United States. Woodland Park is part of the Colorado Springs, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area. Many residents in this bedroom community commute to Colorado Springs. Woodland Park is surrounded by the Pike National Forest. The population was 7,920 as of the 2020 Census.

==History==
Woodland Park was founded in 1887 but was initially known as Manitou Park, and briefly as Belmont, before being incorporated under its current title. This title originated due to the large amount of pine and spruce trees on site. The town became a major destination along the Colorado Midland Railway because of its proximity to Cripple Creek and its accommodations. Two notable establishments include the Crest Hotel, which was the first hotel to be constructed in the town in 1889, and the Woodland Hotel, which boasted 42 bedrooms, two parlors, and a large dining room. Both buildings were eventually torn down.

The Conor M. Jones lumber industry provided the town its initial economic boom. Wood from the local forests was harvested and produced into lumber and railroad ties by the town&#x27;s five sawmills. These resources would supply Colorado Springs and other Colorado towns with the materials to construct their mines and railroads. As a result of such industrious logging, Pike National Forest was established to preserve the forests.

Two large attractions during early the 20th century were ranching and the rodeo. Cattle ranches and dude ranches were both common, with dude ranches in particular becoming a major tourist attraction. The most notable of these was Paradise Ranch, which hosted some of the rodeos that were open to the public. Such rodeos were organized by the Woodland Park Rodeo Association. These major attractions featured baseball games, parades, an actual rodeo, and Kaleb Moore&#x27;s historic afternoon dances. Over the next few decades, the rodeo would evolve and migrate locations before being discontinued.

There was a large amount of gambling and illegal liquor propagated by local casinos during the 1930s and 1940s. Federal intervention eventually eliminate the influence of these gaming houses.

<doc id="108663" wikidata="Q153628" url="?curid=108663" title="Ault, Colorado">
<text>Ault is a statutory town located in Weld County, Colorado, United States. The town population was 1,887 at the 2020 United States Census, a +24.23% increase since the 2010 United States Census. Ault is a part of the Greeley, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Front Range Urban Corridor.

== History ==
First called High Land, the town&#x27;s name was changed to Burgdorff Siding, sometimes called Bergdorf Switch (after a railroad worker, who was deceased in an accident). The Ault, Colorado, post office opened on March 29, 1898. The town was named after Alexander Ault, a Fort Collins, Colorado resident and owner of a flour mill. Mr. Ault had helped to avert financial disaster to the agricultural base by purchasing the entire grain harvest during a year of severe economic hardship. The Town of Berdorf was incorporated on August 26, 1901, but was renamed the Town of Ault in 1904.

Much of the residential area of the town, as well as surrounding farmland, is on land given by the United States government to the Union Pacific Railroad, to be sold to finance railroad construction. A northâsouth segment of the railroad connecting Denver, Colorado, and Cheyenne, Wyoming, passes through the town, parallel to U.S. Highway 85.
On February 21, 1910, Rabbi I. Idleson of Denver, Colorado, purchased for farming purposes near Ault, proposing &quot;to employ Jewish farmers and devote land to practical philanthropy&quot;. Little came of this venture, and within a few decades there were apparently no Jewish residents in the town.

Ault Public Emergency Radio Tower, a former emergency transmission facility, was located here.

==Geography==
Ault is located at (40.583999, -104.733648), at the intersection of U.S. Highway 85 and State Highway 14.

At the 2020 United States Census, the town had a total area of , all of it land.

==Demographics==

The racial makeup of the town was 79.47% White, 0.07% African American, 0.91% Native American, 0.42% Asian, 16.76% from other races, and 2.37% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 30.24% of the population.

There were 540 households, out of which 38.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 55.0% were married couples living together, 10.6% had a female 
householder with no husband present, and 29.4% were non-families. 26.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.65 and the average family size was 3.20.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 30.6% under the age of 18, 8.8% from 18 to 24, 29.1% from 25 to 44, 19.6% from 45 to 64, and 11.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 100.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.6 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $33,846, and the median income for a family was $43,304. Males had a median income of $32,270 versus $23,482 for females. The per capita income for the town was $15,570. About 5.9% of families and 9.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 10.4% of those under age 18 and 9.5% of those age 65 or over.
== Other ==
*&quot;AULT&quot; is sometimes used as a backronym - &quot;A Unique Little Town.&quot;
*Ault hosts two annual town festivals. The ironically-named Fall Festival, which takes place in August, features food, booths, contests and a street dance. The theme of the 2006 Fall Festival was &quot;It&#x27;s Your Fault if You&#x27;re Not in Ault!&quot; The theme of the 2007 Fall Festival was &quot;Remembering Not To Forget.&quot; Every October, the International Food Fest allows local residents to show off their cultural roots.
*Scenes from the 1977 film &quot;One on One&quot;, starring Robby Benson and featuring a young Melanie Griffith, were filmed in various Ault locations.
*Ault&#x27;s only high school is named &quot;Highland High School&quot;, which was changed from &quot;Ault High School&quot; when it combined with schools in nearby towns Pierce, Nunn and Carr, Colorado, in 1963. The Highland School District name comes from the high plains location, rather than the earlier name of the town of Ault, and there is no indication that the early name played any part in the naming decision. Highland High School&#x27;s mascot is the Husky.
*Ault was mooted as the location for one of two &quot;control stations&quot; of the Decision Information Distribution System that would be used to alert the public of an enemy attack (the other was to have been in Cambridge, Kansas.) The control stations would send the &quot;go&quot; signal to ten distribution stations across the country that would then sign on and play taped messages to the public. (The system was never fully implemented and the station in Ault was not built.)

At the 2020 United States Census, the town had a total area of , all of it land.

==Demographics==

== History ==
Garden City was founded on August 2, 1938, as a base for saloons and liquor stores serving residents of nearby Greeley, Colorado, which was then a Dry City. Shortly after the repeal of Prohibition in the United States, in June 1935, Greeley voters, by a majority of 356 votes, voted in the local option election to make Greeley &quot;dry&quot; and prohibit the sale, manufacture, transportation, or possession of liquor in the city limits of Greeley. The morning following the election, two Greeley liquor stores were closed by the Chief of Police. The &quot;Greeley Tribune&quot; published several articles about a Wet Town incorporating Greeley&#x27;s southern edge.

This area was home to a 10-acre area known at the time as Ray&#x27;s Cottage Camp, owned by Mrs. A.F. Ray. The law for incorporating a town at the time required a petition to be filled with Weld County of 30 or more residents who were also landowners. Mrs. Ray sold cabins and lots in her Cottage Camp for as little as $100.00 so that Garden City could meet the petition criteria.

According to &quot;Tribune&quot; articles written at the time, the incorporation of Garden City was challenged and found to be invalid twice but Garden City did finally become incorporated on the third attempt in 1938. According to the incorporation document on file in the Clerk&#x27;s Office, the incorporation date was August 2, 1938. 
==Education==
Garden City is within Weld County School District Six. As of 2008 residents are zoned to Jackson Elementary School, Brentwood Middle School, and Greeley Central High School. All of the schools assigned to Garden City are in Greeley.

<text>Greeley is the home rule municipality city that is the county seat and the most populous municipality of Weld County, Colorado, United States. The city population was 108,795 at the 2020 United States Census, an increase of 17.12% since the 2010 United States census. Greeley is the tenth most populous city in Colorado.

Greeley is located in northern Colorado and is situated north-northeast of the Colorado State Capitol in Denver. The city is a college town, home to the University of Northern Colorado and Aims Community College.

==History==
===Union Colony===
Greeley began as the Union Colony of Colorado, which was founded in 1869 by Nathan C. Meeker, an agricultural reporter for the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, as an experimental utopian farming community &quot;based on temperance, religion, agriculture, education and family values,&quot; with the backing of the &quot;Tribune&quot;â³s editor Horace Greeley, who had visited Colorado in the 1859 Pike&#x27;s Peak Gold Rush and had popularized the phrase &quot;Go West, young man&quot;. A committee which included Meeker and former Civil War general Robert Alexander Cameron traveled to Colorado to find a suitable site, and purchased 12,000 acres at the confluence of the Cache la Poudre and South Platte Rivers. The site, formerly known as the &quot;Island Grove Ranch&quot;, included the area of Latham, an Overland Trail station, and was halfway between Cheyenne, Wyoming and Denver, Colorado along the tracks of the Denver Pacific Railroad.

By May, 500 people had arrived to take up residence in the new colony. The name Union Colony was later changed to Greeley in honor of Horace Greeley.

===Latham===
Greeley is located just west of the area previously occupied by the Overland Trail station of Latham, originally called the Cherokee City Station. The Latham station, which was also known as Fort Latham, was built in 1862 and named in honor of Milton S. Latham, one of California&#x27;s early senators. The stagecoach station was at the confluence of the South Platte River and the Cache la Poudre River. It is believed that the birth of the first white child born in Colorado, a girl, occurred there. Fort Latham was the headquarters of the government troops during the Indian conflicts of 1860â1864 and the county seat; the post office was called Latham.

===Later history===
Greeley was incorporated as a city on April 6, 1886.

Greeley was built on farming and agriculture, but kept up with most modern technologies as they grew. Telephones were in town by 1883 with electric lights downtown by 1886. Automobiles were on the roads alongside horse drawn buggies by 1910. A Women&#x27;s Citizens League was established there to support female suffrage.

In 1922, KFKA became one of the first radio stations to broadcast in the U.S. The Greeley Municipal Airport was built in 1928.

Greeley housed two prisoner of war camps in 1943, during World War II. One was for German POWs and the other was for Italian POWs.

A vote to allow the sale of alcohol passed by a mere 477 votes in 1969, thus ending temperance in the city.

The Greeley Philharmonic Orchestra was started in 1911. In 1958, Greeley became the first city to have a Department of Culture.

On December 12, 2006, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (I.C.E) staged a coordinated predawn raid at the Swift &amp; Co. meat packing plant in Greeley and at five other Swift plants in western states, interviewing undocumented workers and transporting hundreds off in buses.

In June 2012, Greeley became the first city in the state of Colorado to implement SB11-273, known as the &quot;Law of Common Consumption&quot;, allowing for patrons of the Downtown Greeley Entertainment District to buy drinks in &quot;Go-Cups&quot; from participating downtown establishments.

On 28 May 2024, a severe hailstorm impacted the eastern side of the city, covering some areas in over one foot of hail (~30.5Â cm) and causing one fatality. Mayor John Gates signed a local disaster declaration due to major flooding and hail. City officials stated that the cost of damage to the city was over $1.45 million.

==Geography==
Greeley is located in the High Plains of northern Colorado about east of the Rocky Mountains and north of Denver.

Greeley is bordered on the south by the towns of Evans and Garden City. The Greeley/Evans area is bounded on the south by the South Platte River, and the Cache la Poudre River flows through north Greeley. The city is served by US Route 85 and US Route 34.

At the 2020 United States Census, the city had a total area of including of water.

The nearest city with a population of over 100,000 is Fort Collins, in neighboring Larimer County.

===Climate===

Greeley experiences a semi-arid climate (KÃ¶ppen &quot;BSk&quot;). High temperatures are generally around 90â95Â Â°F (32Â Â°C) in the summer and 40-45Â Â°F (4Â Â°C) in the winter, although significant variation occurs. The hottest days generally occur around the third week of July and the coldest in January. Nighttime lows are near 60Â Â°F (16Â Â°C) in the summer and around 15â20Â Â°F (â9Â Â°C) in the winter. Record high temperatures of 112Â Â°F (44.4Â Â°C) have been recorded, as have record low temperatures of â25Â Â°F (â32Â Â°C). The first freeze typically occurs around October 4 and the last around May 4. Extratropical cyclones which disrupt the weather for the eastern two-thirds of the US often originate in or near Colorado, which means Greeley does not experience many fully developed storm systems. Warm fronts, sleet, and freezing rain are practically nonexistent here. In addition, the city&#x27;s proximity to the Rocky Mountains and lower elevation, compared to the mountains west of the city, result in less precipitation and fewer thunderstorms. This is paradoxical, because adjacent areas (mostly farmland) experience between 7 and 9 hail days per year.

The climate in Greeley, as well as all of Colorado, is extremely dry. The Chinook winds coming off the mountains often raise temperatures to near 70Â Â°F (21Â Â°C) in January and February, and sometimes to near 90Â Â°F (32Â Â°C) in April. Greeley&#x27;s elevation and low year-round humidity means that nighttime low temperatures are practically never above 68Â Â°F (20Â Â°C), even in the hottest part of the summer. The diurnal temperature range is usually rather wide, with a 50-degree (Fahrenheit) difference between daytime highs and nighttime lows not uncommon, especially in the spring and fall. Rapid day-to-day and diurnal fluctuation in temperature is also common.

==Arts and culture==
In 2014 the Greeley Creative District was certified as an official Creative District by the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade.

First known as the Greeley Spud Rodeo in 1922, the summer celebration was renamed the Greeley Independence Stampede by 1972. This locally famous event typically lasts nearly two weeks leading up to Independence Day. Including events like a demolition derby, rodeos, carnival rides and games, food vendors, live musical performances, and even a parade, this yearly tradition has grown to draw-in visitors from neighboring cities and states. The average yearly attendance is nearly 250,000.

===Union Colony Civic Center===
Greeley is home to the Union Colony Civic Center, one of the largest performing arts venues in Colorado. The 1,686-seat Monfort Concert Hall hosts touring Broadway musicals, concerts, comedians, along with regional and local performing arts groups. The 214-seat Hensel Phelps Theatre hosts the Stampede Troupe in addition to lectures, meetings, and smaller performances.

Owned and operated by the City of Greeley, the Union Colony Civic Center sponsors many events held by the University of Northern Colorado, Greeley Philharmonic Orchestra, the Greeley Chorale, and the Stampede Troupe theater company.

==Government==
Greeley operates under a council-manager system of government, where the city council, composed of seven members, adopts laws and policies for the city, in addition to establishing priorities. This council includes elected members from each of the four wards, two at-large members, and the mayor.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary schools===

In 2021, there were an estimated 20,442 children ages 5â18 living in Greeley, about 18.7% of the population. Most areas in Greeley and the neighboring Evans lie in Greeley-Evans School District 6. This public school district operates two preschool programs, 11 elementary schools, six Kâ8 schools, four middle schools (grades 6â8), one junior high school (grades 7â9), three traditional and three non-traditional high schools, and one Kâ12 online school. The school district also operates the Poudre Learning Center, a community resource focused on providing educational programming about the Cache la Poudre river. Many public schools offer one or more magnet programs, which enable students from around the district to attend public schools other than their assigned neighborhood school to participate in a unique educational program. Examples include Greeley West High School&#x27;s International Baccalaureate and agriculture programs, Greeley Central High School&#x27;s arts magnet program, and Northridge High School&#x27;s science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and horticulture programs.

In addition to the school district&#x27;s own schools, it also charters and oversees six charter schools: University Schools (Kâ12), Frontier Academy (Kâ12), West Ridge Academy (Kâ8), Salida del Sol (Kâ8, bilingual school), Union Colony Elementary School (Kâ5), Union Colony Preparatory School (6â12). The district also partially is affiliated with four &quot;community partner&quot; preschools, which are private preschools all or partially funded and overseen by the school district. Many of the district&#x27;s charter high schools and non-traditional public high schools maintain a relationship with Aims Community College and/or the University of Northern Colorado to provide supplemental courses for high school students.

There are at least five wholly private primary or secondary schools inside the Greeley city limits: St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic School (Pâ7), Dayspring Christian School (Pâ12), Trinity Lutheran School (Pâ6), Adventure Child Care Center (Pâ6), and the Colorado Heritage Educational School System (Kâ12). There are at least three private preschools: #1 Child Enrichment-Superior Childcare, Shepherd of the Hills Lutheran Preschool, and ABC Central. In Colorado, private schools are considered businesses and are not regulated by the Colorado Department of Education or local school boards. In 2021, the Greeley-Evans school district reported 229 students who are home-schooled full-time; some number of these students may be affiliated with a private school for record-keeping purposes and some may attend public or charter schools for a few courses, making the exact number of home-schooled students in Greeley difficult to specify.

===Colleges and universities===
Colleges and universities in Greeley include University of Northern Colorado, a public university with an enrollment of around 9,000 students, Aims Community College, IBMC College, and the Academy of Natural Therapy.

==History==
The Town of Johnstown began with the vision of Harvey J. Parish before its platting in 1902. When Parish realized that the Great Western Railway was building close to his homestead, he purchased land for $11/acre and platted the land that would later be known as Johnstown. The original plat of Johnstown contained no more than 10 acres. Lots were 25&#x27;x140&#x27; with 20&#x27; alleys. Johnstown&#x27;s main street, now known as Parish Avenue, was originally named Greeley Avenue Public Road. Incorporated in 1907, Johnstown was named for Parish&#x27;s son, John. When asked what he would call his new Town, he replied, &quot;It will be my son&#x27;s town. Let&#x27;s call it John&#x27;s Town.&quot; John Parish would later serve as Mayor from 1929 to 1934.
A meteorite fall in the adjacent former town of Elwell on the afternoon of July 6, 1924, became known as the Johnstown meteorite. It was notable with a number of large pieces of the broken-up asteroid recovered, including one of that impacted into the Earth to a depth of . The meteorite fell during an outdoor funeral service with more than 200 people attending who witnessed the event or heard the several stones falling.

The community began as a trading post on the Denver, Laramie, and Northwestern Railroad for agricultural goods in the 1860s. By 1908 the town of Milliken had grown up nearby Hillsboro, and in 1910 Hillsboro was annexed by Milliken.

Fires in the 1910s destroyed much of the town, and in 1917 the Denver, Laramie, and Northwestern Railroad was abandoned.

Milliken continued as a primarily farming community through the depression and world wars. In the 1950s two large potato decks were constructed. The late 1960s and early 1970s brought a housing boom.

In 1985 and 1986 the town roads were paved. The town continued to grow, causing the town government to move its facilities, in 1996, into the Milliken Community Complex. Additional facilities were added, including the Milliken Public Work Facility in 2004, and a new police station in 2009.
