<text>Cameron Park is a census-designated place (CDP) in El Dorado County, California, United States and is part of the Greater Sacramento Area. The population was 19,171 in the 2020 census, up from 18,228 in 2010. Cameron Park is a community located in the Northern California Gold Country of the Sierra Nevada foothills, approximately 30 miles (50 km) east of Sacramento and 70 miles (110 km) west of South Lake Tahoe.

==History==
The original Native American inhabitants of the area surrounding Cameron Park were Nisenan, or Southern Maidu Indians. Grinding rocks and burial mounds, still visible in various locations in and near the park, serve as glimpses into their past. But modern development accelerated in the area when Larry Cameron purchased of foothill land in the 1950s for development purposes - first for ranching, then for housing, a golf course, parks, a lake and a small airport. In the years since, the land has slowly been sub-divided into parcels used for purposes varying from ranch-sized properties to medium- and high-density residential neighborhoods.

Today, Cameron Park contains a mix of ranches, single family homes, condominiums, apartments and businesses. As of the 2020 Census, the Cameron Park CDP had 7,748 housing units.

==Geography and climate==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and (0.62%) is water (Cameron Park Lake).

Cameron Park is situated in an interior chaparral zone or brush zone just east of the Central Valley. It is the closest population center to the Pine Hill Ecological Reserve. Native vegetation includes an abundance of redbud and manzanita bushes, and brush in general. Where treed the native trees are primarily gray pines, and oak trees with some small groves of ponderosa pines starting in the higher elevation zones. The elevation of Cameron Park varies between approximately above sea level, and is not considered in the snow zone of the Sierra Nevada mountains to the east, which are typically between 3,000 and 5,000 feet of elevation and above.

Summers are generally hot and dry, with average daytime temperatures in the range, but sometimes reaching , or more. It can be very dry, with little effect of mountain thunderstorms or monsoonal flows that affect the south and interiors. Nights, however, tend to cool off more so than in the Sacramento Valley below, and temperatures in general range a few degrees below the eastern portion of the Central Valley because of the elevation difference. Autumns tend to be an &quot;extended dry, hot summer&quot; throughout California and Cameron Park is no exception. Winters are generally cool and rainy, with highs averaging and nights occasionally dropping below freezing. Cameron Park typically receives exceptional snow events, about once every few years.

The soil in Cameron Park is reddish and clay-like and usually must be amended in order for many non-native ornamental plants to survive. The soil is derived from Gabbro type of volcanic bedrock and despite its clay-like composition it is good soil and rich in nutrients. Cameron Park is in Sunset Climate Zone 9 and USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 9A.

<text>El Dorado Hills (&quot;El Dorado&quot;, Spanish for &quot;The Golden&quot;) is an unincorporated town and census-designated place in El Dorado County, California. Located in the Greater Sacramento region of Northern California, it had a population of 50,547 at the 2020 census, up from 42,108 at the 2010 census.

==History==
During the California Gold Rush, gold was washed down the South Fork of the American River, into areas now in El Dorado Hills and Folsom, but farming and ranching supplanted mining or panning for gold. Portions of two Pony Express routes in this area from 1860 to 1861 remain as modern El Dorado Hills roads.

The modern history of El Dorado Hills dates back to the early 1960s when original developer Allan Lindsey began its development as a master-planned community. The original master plan, prepared by architect Victor Gruen, covered the area generally north of U.S. Highway 50, and part of the area south of US 50 now considered to be part of the community. El Dorado Hills was envisioned as a large-scale master-planned community that would be completely planned from its inception as a group of residential &quot;villages&quot;. Other land uses in the master plan included a business park, 18-hole golf course, community parks, schools, a community shopping center, and small commercial centers in each village. The master plan emphasized open space between villages and the opportunity for outdoor recreation.

Between the late 1960s and mid-1990s, growth occurred at a moderate pace as new families relocated from Sacramento, Southern California and the Bay Area. This growth consisted primarily of residential housing, as retail developments were limited to two shopping centers on the corners Green Valley &amp; Francisco and El Dorado Hills Boulevard &amp; US 50. Each neighborhood created during this time period was given a name and referred to as a &quot;village&quot; by local inhabitants. The original villages of El Dorado Hills include Ridgeview, Park, Saint Andrews, Crown, and Governors. In the 1980s and 1990s, the major part of Lake Hills Estates north of Green Valley Road was reorganized into Lake Forest Village, containing the neighborhoods of Waterford, The Summit, Green Valley Hills, Winterhaven, Marina Woods and Windsor Point. Additional villages that have developed subsequently include Fairchild, Sterlingshire, Highland Hills, Highland View, Bridlewood, Hills of El Dorado, Woodridge, Laurel Oaks and the master-planned community of Serrano.

The El Dorado Hills Town Center, just south of US 50, is a mixed-use project developed by The Mansour Company. Occupying of land and, at completion, of buildings, it is the center of town and of the region.

==Geography==

El Dorado Hills (EDH), as defined by the 2010 census-designated place (CDP), is at the western border of El Dorado County, between the City of Folsom and the unincorporated community of Cameron Park. The northern limits of the CDP are Folsom Lake and the South Fork of the American River, where river rafters use Skunk Hollow and Salmon Falls as takeout landings. West of Latrobe Road, the south edge of the CDP follows railroad tracks formerly used by the Southern Pacific between the cities of Folsom and Placerville. East of Latrobe Road the south edge follows topography running roughly east–west.

The 2010 CDP has a land area of , more than double the size of its boundaries in 2000 CDP, which was .

The subsurface environment of El Dorado Hills is relatively free of groundwater and soil contamination, based upon an areawide analysis of the potential for pesticide contamination and evaluation of underground storage tanks.(Earth Metrics, 1989)

<text>Georgetown (formerly Growlersburg) is a census-designated place (CDP) in El Dorado County, California, United States. It is the northeasternmost town in the California Mother Lode. The population was 2,546 in the 2020 census, up from 2,367 in 2010, and 962 in 2000. The town is registered as California Historical Landmark #484.

==History==
Founded August 7, 1849, by George Phipps and party, Georgetown was nicknamed &quot;Growlersburg&quot; due to the heavy, gold-laden quartz rocks that &quot;growled&quot; in the miners&#x27; pants as they walked around town. Georgetown is named for George Phipps. The first post office was established in 1851.

After a disastrous fire in 1852, the old town was moved from the canyon in lower Main Street to its present site, and, unique in early-day planning, Main Street was laid out wide, with side streets . After this new reconstruction, the residents of the city proclaimed their town as the &quot;Pride of the Mountains&quot;.

The hub of an immensely rich gold mining area, Georgetown had a population of about three thousand from 1854 to 1856. As a gold rush camp, the community outlasted many other towns, because the gold found nearby was solid primary deposits, as opposed to placer deposits. Gold production continued until after the turn of the 20th century.

During the Civil War the people of the town wanted to show their support for the Union. They raised the Stars and Stripes with the inscription &quot;Justice and Equality&quot; on July 4, 1861.

==Geography==

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Georgetown has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csa&quot; on climate maps. Due to orographic lifting, Georgetown gets about four times the amount of precipitation as the western valley locations. A small amount of it falls as snow that melts quickly due to the above freezing temperatures, but for no more than four inches a year. The high precipitation allows for vegetation to flourish, but when a lot of it becomes dry during the hot and dry summers, wildfires become a prominent risk.

<text>Placerville (, ; &quot;placer&quot;, Spanish for &quot;sand deposit&quot;, representing the placer mining that was predominant in the town&#x27;s development, and &quot;ville&quot;, French for &quot;town&quot;) is a city in and the county seat of El Dorado County, California, United States. The population was 10,747 as of the 2020 census, up from 10,389 as of the 2010 census. It is part of the Sacramento metropolitan area.

== History ==
A former Maidu settlement called Indak was located at the site of the town.

After the discovery of gold at Sutter&#x27;s Mill in nearby Coloma, California, by James W. Marshall in 1848 sparked the California Gold Rush, the small town now known as Placerville was known as Dry Diggin&#x27;s after the manner in which the miners moved cartloads of dry soil to run water to separate the gold from the soil.

Later in 1849, the town earned its most common historical name, Hangtown, because of the numerous hangings that had occurred there. However, there is debate on exactly how many lynchings occurred in the town. The town had no police force (in 1849) and five immigrants attempted robbery of a Mexican gambler. Of the five immigrants, two Frenchmen and one Chilean were known wanted men, and they were not given any trial, instead they were hanged on an oak tree on Main Street by a mob. The name &quot;Hangtown&quot; stuck after that event.

By about 1850, the temperance league and a few local churches had begun to request that a more friendly name be bestowed upon the town. The name was not changed until 1854 when the City of Placerville was incorporated, taking the name from the local placer gold deposits. At its incorporation, Placerville was the third largest town in California. In 1857, the county seat was then moved from Coloma to Placerville, where it remains today. The town&#x27;s first post office opened in 1850. In 1871, the Placerville Union Cemetery was founded by a group of fraternal organizations, and it holds the graves of many of the city founders.

Placerville was a central hub for the Mother Lode region&#x27;s mining operations. The town had many services, including transportation (of people and goods), lodging, banking, and had a market and general store. The history of hard-rock mining is evidenced by an open and accessible Gold Bug Park &amp; Mine, now a museum with tours and books.

The Sacramento and Placerville Railroad, (later part of the Southern Pacific Railroad) had a branch line that extended from Folsom to Placerville. The track was abandoned in the 1980s and is now used by heritage railroads. The Camino, Placerville and Lake Tahoe Railroad (now abandoned) also operated an shortline that operated between Camino, California, and Placerville until June 17, 1986. The track right-of-way is now a 37-mile hiking and biking path that connects the city of Folsom, California to the town of Camino with plans to extend the trail across the entire El Dorado county and eventually to Lake Tahoe.

Placerville is now registered as California Historical Landmark #701.

Placerville&#x27;s logo featured a hangman&#x27;s noose, in reference to the town&#x27;s history as &quot;Hangtown&quot;, until 2021, when the town council voted to remove it. An earlier proposal to redesign the logo had been rejected in 2020.

The region east of Placerville, popularly known as Apple Hill and Pleasant Valley, is becoming a center for wine production. The wine region is officially designated as the El Dorado AVA. The largest wineries in the area are Boeger, Lava Cap and Madroña, but most of the 30 plus wineries surrounding Placerville are family owned and smaller in wine grape and wine production. The region is &quot;renown[ed] for making vibrantly flavorful, distinctly delicious wines, grown in the dramatic elevations of the Sierra Nevada.&quot; The area is increasingly a center for sophisticated production of Rhone style wines, noted by El Dorado County having a local chapter of the Rhone Rangers winemaker association.

Formerly known as Anderson Field, the arena and main grandstand that is now known as Placerville Speedway was originally built by the El Dorado County Fair during the winter months of 1956. Constructing a clay racing surface around the perimeter of the football field, Warren Jewitt and Bruno Romani created what was originally known as &quot;Hangtown Speedway&quot;. Auto racing took place here for the first time on June 18, 1965.

Since 1965, Placerville Speedway has hosted several racing divisions. The track was cut out of a hillside, giving it higher banking, and covered with a dark red clay racing surface.

Placerville is home to the &quot;Mountain Democrat&quot;, the oldest continuously published newspaper in California, and Marshall Medical Center.

==Transportation==

Placerville is served by two major highways. California State Route 49 runs north and south, connecting the city with the other major communities in the Sierra Nevada foothills. U.S. Route 50 heads west to Sacramento and east to South Lake Tahoe. This portion of U.S. Route 50 is a part of the Lincoln Highway.

El Dorado Transit runs public bus service, both local routes connecting Placerville to other populated areas on the western slope and weekday commuter service to/from Sacramento, including the 20 bus to Iron Point Station.

Amtrak Thruway 20C provides a daily connection to Sacramento Valley Station to the west, and South Lake Tahoe to the east, with a few stops in between.

Placerville is served by the Placerville Airport. A &quot;Good Neighbor&quot; airport (one that takes measures for noise abatement), it has a runway, but is not currently served by any commercial air transport.

==Culture==
Placerville has many old buildings from the Gold Rush days. A walk down Main Street also reveals many historical markers, signifying spots of certain events or persons of importance during this period. Placerville was also on the line of the Pony Express, a short-lived mail carrier service that connected California to the Midwest and East (basically from Sacramento to St. Joseph, Missouri).

Historically, Placerville was often referred to by the name &quot;Hangtown,&quot; because of the 3 unfortunates that were hung after being caught for cattle rustling by locals. Those traveling in the area can still see the site of the hangman&#x27;s platform that was used for public hangings along with a commemorative mannequin (&quot;George&quot;) hanging from a noose above the Old Hangman&#x27;s Tree (now an ice cream parlor). The dummy enjoyed a brief hiatus when town officials attempted to freshen up the town&#x27;s image before returning due to popular demand. In 2015 the dummy was stolen. It has since been replaced. In April 2021, the city council agreed unanimously to remove the noose from the city&#x27;s logo.

Placerville is home to the legendary dish known as the &quot;Hangtown fry&quot; which includes eggs, bacon, and oysters. There are multiple legends regarding the origin, but all stories agree that Placerville is the place of origin.

The Southern Pacific Transportation Company branch line was purchased from the Union Pacific in 1996 for $14 million (~$ in ) by the Joint Powers Authority consisting of Sacramento County, Folsom, and El Dorado County. The line is being converted to a hiking and biking trail, with over 12 miles of the rail line now paved as a Class 1 biking route.

Placerville is the home of United Ancient Order of Druids of California Grove No. 1, which was established in 1860 as the first Druid hall in California. It was reinstated in 2017–18, along with several other historical fraternal societies. Main Street Placerville features a large stone column holding a glass and metal &quot;torch&quot; known as &quot;The Druid Monument&quot;, commemorating the Order&#x27;s inception there 1860. The City of Placerville is currently attempting to repave the roundabout containing the monument, possibly removing it permanently in the process—a proposal that has divided the community.

==Notable people==

Over the years many influential people had shops in Placerville, mostly along the now historic Main Street.

==History==
One of the original Pony Express stations, Twelve Mile House, was located in Pollock Pines. The location was covered by the restaurant Sportsman&#x27;s Hall. The &quot;Hall&quot;, originally opened in 1852 by John and James Blair, who had immigrated from Scotland, still operates today. It is the site of California Registered Historical Landmark #704, which reads: &quot;This was the site of Sportsman&#x27;s Hall, also known as Twelve-Mile House, the hotel operated in the latter 1850s and 1860s by John and James Blair. A stopping place for stages and teams of the Comstock, it became a relay station of the Central Overland Pony Express. Here, at 7:40 A.M., April 4, 1860, pony rider William (Sam) Hamilton riding in from Placerville, handed the express mail to Warren Upson, who, two minutes later, sped on his way eastward.&quot;

Pollock Pines was primarily a lumber community. The name stems from an early land developer, Hiram Robert (H.R.) Pollock, who arrived with his wife Anna and son Claude Earl around 1909. A lumberman by trade, he borrowed money and built a saw mill. When the mill was destroyed by fire in the early 1930s, Hiram and Anna Pollock started selling lots in a subdivision they created out of a piece of land that lay along the ridge, on both sides of Cedar Grove School, and thus gave the town its name.

The Pollock Pines Post Office was established on Apr. 28, 1936, at what is currently 6401A Pony Express Trail, Pollock Pines (originally Hwy 50) with Mrs. Alice P. Grout serving as the first postmaster. The post office was later relocated, and now operates at 2669 Sanders Dr.

The first Pollock Pines store was built on the current location (6401 Pony Express Trail) in the 1930s by Newt Grout. The building included a grocery store, one gas pump, a post office, and a home upstairs. The restaurant &quot;Frenchy&#x27;s&quot; was run next door by Mr. and Mrs. Ted Lang. They bought the liquor license of the Lucky Dime and added a bar. In 1943, the restaurant was renamed to &quot;50 Grand&quot; for its proximity to U.S. Highway 50. It burned down in 1983, operated down the road for one year, then reopened in 1984 back in its original location. The restaurant has been in continual operation as 50 Grand since the rebranding, celebrating its 80th anniversary in November 2023.

In 2014 the King Fire burned in the Eldorado National Forest and on private land, destroying 80 structures, including residences and outbuildings near Pollock Pines. The cause of the fire, which was started September 13 and was extinguished October 9, was determined to be arson. The fire threatened thousands of homes as well as reservoirs that provide water and electricity to portions of California. The fire and the post-burn area were extensively studied by NASA&#x27;s wildfires program which collected data on pre-burn forest conditions, fuel moisture, fire behavior, burned area and severity, post-fire forest structure, erosion, re-vegetation, and targeted mitigation for the fire science and management communities.

The Caldor Fire started on August 14, 2021, near Little Mountain, south of Pollock Pines in El Dorado County, about two miles east of Omo Ranch and four miles south of Grizzly Flats. It was a large wildfire that burned 221,835 acres (89,773 hectares) in the Eldorado National Forest and other areas of the Sierra Nevada in El Dorado, Amador, and Alpine County, California, in the United States during the 2021 California wildfire season. It was fully contained on Thursday, October 21, 2021. The Caldor Fire destroyed 1,005 structures and damaged 81 more, primarily in the U.S. Highway 50 corridor.

<text>Shingle Springs (formerly, Shingle Spring and Shingle) is a census-designated place (CDP) in El Dorado County, California, United States. The population was 4,432 at the 2010 census, up from 2,643 at the 2000 census. It is located about from Sacramento in the Gold Country foothills and sits directly on Highway 50. The towns of Coloma and Placerville are less than away.

Shingle Springs is part of the Sacramento–Arden-Arcade–Roseville Metropolitan Statistical Area. The Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians, a federally recognized tribe of Maidu and Miwok people, are headquartered in Shingle Springs.

==History==

Like many of the other towns in California&#x27;s Mother Lode, Shingle Springs grew out of a camp set up by gold miners during the California Gold Rush - in this case, a group of &quot;49ers&quot; who&#x27;d followed the Carson-Emigrant Trail through Pleasant Valley, Nevada. The community took its name from a horse-drawn shingle machine capable of producing 16,000 shingles a day that was located near the springs at the western edge of the camp. 

A rich store of written records preserved by Shingle Springs pioneers has left a detailed picture of the Gold Rush. For example, the Boston-Newton Joint Stock Association, which left Boston on April 16, 1849, camped there the night before their arrival at Sutter&#x27;s Fort on September 27, after a remarkable journey across the continent. The &quot;Shingle Spring&quot; post office also operated from 1853 to 1855. The &quot;Shingle Springs&quot; post office opened in 1865. The office&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Shingle&quot; in 1895, and reverted in 1955. As a result, the town is now designated California Historical Landmark #456. 

Of particular interest is the fact that, before the area was settled by Anglo-Americans, a Maidu village called Bamom was located in the vicinity of modern-day Shingle Springs.

==Caruthers fair==
Well-known events in the area include the Caruthers District Fair. It was started in 1923, after some hesitation by community members as work and expenses increased. One of the first programs at the fair involved a football game between Caruthers and Fresno State. Caruthers lost 41–0. In early years, the fair hosted races on sheep. Every year a fair queen is chosen, who is selected based on ticket sales. A group of girls sell them during the summer to support the fair.

<text>Clovis is a city in Fresno County, California, United States. It was established in 1890 as a freight stop for the San Joaquin Valley Railroad by a group of Fresno businessmen and Michigan railroad speculator Marcus Pollasky. The railroad bought the land from two farmers and named the station after one of them, Clovis Cole. Pollasky then developed a town on the site, also named Clovis.

The completion of the lumber flume in 1894 led to the growth of the area around Clovis Station where a lumberyard and sawmill were built. Clovis was officially incorporated as a city in 1912. Today, Clovis celebrates its heritage as an American frontier town, known for its rodeo, Old Town Clovis historic district, and its motto &quot;Clovis – A Way of Life.&quot;

In the 2020 census, the population was 120,124. Clovis is located northeast of downtown Fresno, at an elevation of 361 feet (110 m).

==History==
The city of Clovis began as a freight stop along the San Joaquin Valley Railroad. Organized on January 15, 1890, by Fresno businessmen Thomas E. Hughes, Fulton Berry, Gilbert R. Osmun, H.D. Colson, John D. Gray, and William M. Williams, in partnership with Michigan railroad speculator Marcus Pollasky, the SJVRR began construction in Fresno on July 4, 1891, and reached the farmlands of Clovis M. Cole and George Owen by October of that year. The railroad purchased right-of-way from both farmers, half from each – the east side from Cole and the west side from Owen – and ran tracks up the borderline between the two properties. The railroad agreed to establish a station on the west side of the tracks and to call it &quot;Clovis.&quot; The Clovis station, which was named after Clovis Cole, was positioned on the Owen side of the track.

Cole and Owen later sold land to Marcus Pollasky for the development of a townsite. Fresno civil engineer Ingvart Tielman mapped the townsite on behalf of Pollasky on December 29, 1891. The original townsite featured streets named for the officers and principal investors of the railroad: (Benjamin) Woodworth, (Marcus) Pollasky, Fulton (Berry), (Thomas) Hughes, (Gerald) Osmun, and (O. D.) Baron. The townsite, named &quot;Clovis&quot; after Clovis Station by Pollasky, was laid out on what was originally Owen&#x27;s land.

The railroad was completed as far as the town of Hamptonville (now Friant) on the banks of the San Joaquin River, just from its point of origin in Fresno. Articles of Incorporation for the San Joaquin Valley Railroad indicate that the corporation intended to build of track, including sidings and spurs, through the agricultural acreage east of Fresno, then north to the timber and mineral resources of the Sierra foothills. At the time, Hamptonville was called &quot;Pollasky&quot;. A celebration of the completion of track-laying was held at the Pollasky terminus on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving of 1891 with a reported 3,000 Fresnans attending. The railroad began official operation in January 1892.

The first year of operation of the railroad coincided with the beginnings of a deep national economic decline. Farmers were unable to get a profitable return on their crops, banks and railroads failed nationwide. The SJVRR was unable to generate sufficient revenues to pay its debt, was leased to the Southern Pacific Railroad and subsequently bought by SPRR in 1893. By reducing the railroad&#x27;s schedule of operation and trimming costs, the Southern Pacific was able to turn a small profit in the first years after its acquisition.

At the same time that the railroad was being planned, a group of Michigan lumbermen began acquiring thousands of acres of timber in the Sierra Nevada about northeast of Fresno and founded the Fresno Flume and Irrigation Company in 1891. A dam was built across Stevenson Creek to create a lake that would enable them to move freshly cut timber to a mill beside the lake. They then constructed a , , V-shaped flume that started at the foot of the dam. As lumber was rough-cut at the mill, it was loaded into the flume and propelled by water to a planing mill east of the Clovis railroad station, where the Clovis Rodeo and Clark Intermediate School sit today. The lumber mill and yard had its own network of rails to move lumber around the yard and to connect with the SJVRR just south of Clovis station.

The completion in 1894 of the lumber flume and commencement of mill operations provided the impetus for further development of the area around the Clovis Station. The town began to take shape as lumber yard employees built homes close to their employment. Service businesses, churches, and schools became necessary, and the town was begun. Clovis&#x27;s first post office opened in 1895. An 1896 newspaper article describes the town as having a population approaching 500 citizens.

Clovis was incorporated as a city in February 1912. Principal streets in the town center were named for the railroad&#x27;s officers. Fulton Street was later named Front Street, then Main Street, and is now Clovis Avenue.

The lumber mill burned in 1914 and was not rebuilt. The grounds are now occupied by Clark Intermediate School and the Clovis Rodeo Grounds. Clovis has a long history as a western town known for its slogan, &quot;Clovis – A Way of Life&quot;. Since 1914, the Clovis Rodeo has been held on the last weekend in April, with a parade on Saturday morning, followed by the rodeo that afternoon and all day Sunday. Also contributing to the &quot;Clovis way of life&quot; are a number of street festivals, including Big Hat Days, ClovisFest, and the weekly Friday Night Farmer&#x27;s Market held between mid-May and mid-September every year.

The last surviving structure built by the railroad is a depot now located near the site of the original Clovis Station. The earliest photos, from about 1910, show the depot situated in front of the Tarpey winery south of the intersection of Ashlan and Clovis Avenues. In 1999 it was moved to its present location in the town&#x27;s center, at the northeast corner of Clovis Avenue and Fourth Street, and was restored by the Clovis Big Dry Creek Historical Society with financing, labor, and materials donated by local businesses and contractors.

Marcus Pollasky was a lawyer, born in Michigan, living in Chicago just before he came to Fresno. Throughout his life he tried to create several projects similar to the SJVRR, including projects in Eureka, California, Virginia, Michigan, and Oklahoma. Few were ever actually built. In 1896, Pollasky sued Collis P. Huntington in Los Angeles courts over the money he lost in Fresno, &quot;while engaged in a joint venture with the defendant, Huntington&quot;. It has long been speculated that Pollasky was an agent of the Southern Pacific, and this &quot;joint venture&quot; suit seems to prove that point.

Many buildings in the town core have been renovated. Older storefronts on Clovis Avenue, the main street running through town, have been restored and new buildings have been designed with facades that resemble those found in the early 20th century. The historic center has been reborn as &quot;Old Town Clovis&quot;.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 23.28 square miles (60.29 km2), all of it land.

Clovis is situated midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, bordering Fresno, in the agriculturally rich San Joaquin Valley. Lying at the foot of the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range, which includes Yosemite, Kings Canyon, and Sequoia National Parks, Clovis has been known as &quot;Gateway to the Sierras&quot; since its incorporation in 1912.

The formation of alluvial fans in this part of the San Joaquin Valley has led to a rather flat regional geography. The Clovis area has active and potentially active seismic fault zones. The elevation of Clovis is approximately above mean sea datum According to the Flood Hazard Boundary Map produced by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, part of Clovis is within the 100-year flood zone, such as some of the area near the Clovis Towne Center. The groundwater flow in Clovis is generally to the southwest.

<text>Coalinga ( or ) is a city in the Pleasant Valley in Fresno County and the western San Joaquin Valley, in central California about 80 miles (128 km) southeast of Salinas.

It was formerly known as &quot;Coaling Station A&quot;, &quot;Coalingo&quot;, and &quot;Coalinga Station&quot;.

The population was 13,380 as of the 2010 census, up from 11,668 at the 2000 census. It is the site of both Pleasant Valley State Prison and Coalinga State Hospital.

==History==

===19th century===
Legendary bandit Joaquin Murrieta was killed in 1853 at his headquarters, Arroyo de Cantua, north of Coalinga. California Historical Landmark #344 marks the approximate site of where he was slain, near the junction of present-day State Route 33 and Route 198.
Before 20th-century diesel locomotives, steam locomotives were used, and powered in the San Joaquin Valley by burning coal mined from the northern foothills of Mount Diablo to the north. The Southern Pacific Railroad Company established the site as a coaling station in 1888, and it was called simply Coaling Station A. Local tradition has it that an official of Southern Pacific made the name more sonorous by adding an &quot;a&quot; to it. However, it is just as likely that the small railside signs of the day, which often abbreviated names, read &quot;COALINGA&quot; to mean &quot;Coaling A.&quot; [Another example is Braner&#x27;s Cut north of Eureka, whose sign said &quot;BRACUT,&quot; which has now become the name of that spot along Highway 101.] The resemblance to Nahuatl (where &quot;cōātl&quot; = &quot;snake&quot;) is accidental.

The first post office was established in 1899. The city was incorporated in 1906.

=== 20th century ===

The town is mostly surrounded by the Coalinga oil field whose principal operator, Chevron, is a major employer in the area.

===1983 earthquake===

On May 2, 1983, Coalinga was struck by an earthquake with a moment magnitude of 6.5, which nearly destroyed more than 300 homes and apartment buildings; another 691 buildings suffered major damage, and hundreds more had minor damage. Damage was severe in downtown Coalinga; the eight-block commercial district was almost totally destroyed. The shock was felt as far away as Los Angeles and western Nevada, and was followed by a series of aftershocks that caused additional minor damage and some injuries. Only one death was reported: a man who succumbed to a heart attack.

===2022 water shortage===
In 2022, the city struggled to confront an acute water shortage. The city’s only water source is an aqueduct that is managed by the federal government. Officials estimated that the water was going to run dry before the end of 2022. Due to statewide floods that winter, though, the prediction was no longer valid.

==Geography==
Coalinga is located southwest of Fresno, at an elevation of . The topography is generally level, suitable for a number of field crops which do not require large amounts of water. It is located in the Pleasant Valley, east of the Alcalde Hills, north of the Jacalitos Hills, south of the Anticline Ridge, and west of the Guijarral Hills, all eastern foothills of the Diablo Range. The Los Gatos Creek runs north of town. 

===Geology===
Underlying rock formations include the occurrence of Vaqueros sandstone. Surrounding the town in a semicircle from the west, around the north, and to the east are several anticlinal formations containing considerable accumulations of petroleum as the Coalinga Oil Field, from which oil has been withdrawn for more than a hundred years.

The city is located near a particularly active portion of the San Andreas Fault, and earthquakes are frequent.

===Climate===
Coalinga has a cold semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;), with very hot summers and cool winters. Its hardiness zone is 9a. The average annual precipitation is , falling mainly from October to May.

==Economy==
The city&#x27;s main industries are agriculture, oil, Cannabis, education and incarceration. The city is home to the Coalinga Oil Field, operated by Chevron and Aera Energy; the Guijarral Hills Oil Field; and Pleasant Valley State Prison.

Coalinga State Hospital opened in September 2005. It was California&#x27;s first new mental health hospital in more than 50 years, a 1,500-bed facility built specifically to house sexually violent predators.

In 2016 Coalinga was one of the first cities to pass an ordinance allowing for the cultivation, manufacturing and distribution of cannabis. The City sold its old Claremont Custody Center (jail) to Ocean Grown Extracts for $4.1 million, to help the city get out of a financial crisis and to supply jobs to local residents.

==Education==

Coalinga is the site of Coalinga College (formally West Hills College-Coalinga), which is part of the California Community Colleges system.

Its children are served by the Coalinga-Huron Joint Unified School District, of which Coalinga High School is a part.

==Water issues==
In July 2009, action by the Federal Bureau of Reclamation to protect threatened fish reduced irrigation pumping to parts of the California Central Valley, causing canals leading into Huron and the surrounding areas and the farms that rely on them to dry up. Unemployment has reached over 40% as farms dried up. Governor Schwarzenegger stated the federal action is putting the fish &quot;above the needs of millions of Californians.&quot; The issue received coverage on the &quot;Hannity&quot; program from Fox News broadcasting from Huron. Comedian Paul Rodriguez acted as a celebrity spokesperson criticizing the action, as his mother owns a farm in the area. Fox&#x27;s coverage of the issue has been criticized, and the California Progress Report argued that Huron&#x27;s problems are more the result of poor water management decisions by the local water district than by the federal government. Environmental and fishing groups have argued that the action to protect fish will ultimately save more jobs in the fishing and tourism industries than will be lost in agriculture.

==Transportation==
San Joaquin Valley Railroad acquired the former Southern Pacific lines and provides freight service from Huron to Union Pacific&#x27;s Fresno Subdivision at Goshen.

Fresno County Rural Transit Agency provides bus service from Huron to Coalinga and Fresno.

<text>Kerman (formerly Collis) is a city at the intersection of State Route 180 and State Route 145 in Fresno County, California, United States. The population was 16,016 at the 2010 census. Kerman is located west of Fresno, at an elevation of .

==History==
Around 1891, the Southern Pacific Railroad constructed a new line between Tracy and Fresno. A watering tank and pump on that line was the beginning of Kerman, which was christened Collis in honor of the President of the railroad, Collis Potter Huntington. The first inhabitant, the caretaker of the pump and tank, kept the tank full of water for the thirsty engines with their long and lumbering trains. After some months, he resigned his job, not because of the work, he said, but because it was too lonesome and he was tired of being a hermit. He said he never saw anyone but the train crews and they were always in too big a hurry to carry on a conversation.

On August 3, 1892, the train bandits Chris Evans, John Sontag, and George Contant robbed a Southern Pacific train at Collis. Contant went to Folsom State Prison for the crime. Evans and John Sontag became fugitives for ten months before they were captured in 1893 in what is called the Battle of Stone Corral. John Sontag died of his wounds in custody, and Chris Evans was also sent to Folsom upon his conviction of the crime.

As a speculative venture, the old and very rich Bank of California purchased a huge tract of land in every County of California. The arid, barren land around Kerman seemed to be a good venture, so that happened to be the allotment for Fresno County.

After the death of its promoter, the bank became insolvent and its property was liquidated. The property here attracted the attention of two Los Angeles capitalists, William G. Kerckhoff and Jacob Mansar, who saw a chance to purchase a plentiful water supply from the newly constructed Enterprise Canal, which had its source in the Kings River. The men combined the first three letters of each of their names and christened the area &quot;Kerman.&quot; They pitched the property to Scandinavians and Germans settled in the Midwest.

The Collis post office was opened in 1894, closed in 1899, re-established in 1904, and renamed Kerman in 1906. Kerman incorporated in 1946. The independent Kerman Telephone company retired its four-position manual telephone switchboard, described by a state telephone association as the last of its kind in California, in 1991.

<text>Kingsburg is a city in Fresno County, California. Kingsburg is located southeast of Selma at an elevation of , on the banks of the Kings River. The city is from Fresno, and about from the California Central Coast and Sierra Nevada mountain range. The population was 12,380 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Kingsburg was established as a railroad town, its site set by the Central Pacific Railroad when it completed the Valley Line in 1873. In the early 1870s, Swedish natives settled in a railroad town called &quot;Kings River Switch&quot;. Kingsburg started out as a flag stop on the Central Pacific Railroad called Kings River Switch. In 1874 Kingsburg was called Wheatville and had a post office, later that year they changed the name to Kingsbury. During this time period, Josiah Draper and Andrew Farley each owned a quarter section, about , Draper on the east side of the railroad tracks and Farley on the west side of the tracks. So it was suggested that the east side be called Drapersville and the west side called Farleyville. Two years after that it became Kingsburgh and in January 1894 took on its present spelling, &quot;Kingsburg&quot;, which was finally established as a town in 1908. By 1921, ninety-four percent of the population within a three-mile radius of Kingsburg was Swedish-American, giving the community the nickname of &quot;Little Sweden&quot;. To keep up with the town&#x27;s Swedish history most retail businesses are designed in Swedish architecture.

==Agriculture==
For much of the town&#x27;s history, the fields around Kingsburg were mostly grape vineyards which produce mainly raisins and table grapes; in 2002 a large surplus of raisins and grapes drove the price for these commodities down to an all-time low. Subsequently, farmers were forced to replant the fields with stone fruit, or (particularly on the west side of town) sell their land to developers to help cope with the rising population. Kingsburg was the headquarters of Sun-Maid Growers of California, a producer of raisins and other dried fruits. Fresno is the Corporate Headquarters. Kingsburg is home to the world&#x27;s largest box of raisins, built by students at California State University, Fresno.

==Swedish Festival==

One of the notable landmarks in the community is the Kingsburg water tower, which is shaped like an antique Swedish coffee pot. The water tower was originally built in 1911 and was modified in 1985, inspired by a resident&#x27;s visit to the similarly decorated water tower in Stanton, Iowa; the Kingsburg coffee pot water tower is tall, lit at night, and visible from SR 99. The Kingsburg pot is slightly larger than the Stanton one, at , respectively; the Stanton pot was taken down from its tower in 2015 and preserved, as it had been superseded by a larger water tower in the late 1990s.

The Swedish immigrant heritage of the community is principally preserved with festivals. The Kingsburg Swedish Festival, which is one of the biggest and best known festivals that bring people in from all over the country, is held annually during the third weekend in May. Activities include a Swedish pancake breakfast, a parade and the coronation of the Swedish Festival Queen. Many booths, rides and activities are set up all along the side of Downtown Kingsburg&#x27;s Draper Street. This festival, which has traditionally been held on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, was scheduled for only Saturday and Sunday in 2009 after the town&#x27;s centennial due to the suffering economy, but in 2011, Thursday activities were added to the festival.

<text>Reedley is a city in Fresno County, California, United States. It is located in the San Joaquin Valley, east-southeast of Fresno, at an elevation of . The population at the 2010 census was . Its chief economic source is agriculture, particularly fruit and vegetable cultivation and has thus dubbed itself &quot;The World&#x27;s Fruit Basket&quot;. Reedley is situated along the Kings River, downstream from Centerville.

Reedley hosts several cultural festivals, including but not limited to the Reedley Fiesta, and the Electrical Farm Equipment Parade.

Reedley is named for Thomas Law Reed, a Civil War veteran who gave half of his holdings to the township in 1888.

==History==

In the mid-1800s, American Civil War Union veteran Thomas Law Reed settled in Reedley to grow wheat for Gold Rush miners. His donation of land for a railroad station site established the town as the center of the San Joaquin Valley&#x27;s booming wheat industry. Southern Pacific Railroad officials commemorated his donation by naming the depot in his honor, which the city itself then adopted.

When gold mining fever began to fade, wheat demand slackened. Water from the Kings River was diverted for crop irrigation, and the region&#x27;s agriculture diversified to include fruits, including grapes, figs, and peaches.

With the establishment of water and railroad services, farming families of European immigrants were recruited, and the settlement was incorporated in 1913, with Ordinance No. 1 adopting and prescribing the style of a Common Seal on February 25, 1913. That same year, the city&#x27;s first cement sidewalks, sewer system, and fire department, as well as the first of two steel water towers were constructed. Because of proximity, the Reedley post office provided rural mail delivery to the surrounding region, including Route 2 which covered a section of nearby Tulare County (about 5 miles west of Dinuba).

A colony of Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites, who travelled to California to escape the ecological disaster of the Dust Bowl played an important role in the town&#x27;s early history, settling in Township 8, an area now known as Navelencia. Reedley contains a community of 25 different Christian churches, including Anglican, Catholic, Armenian, Baptist, and Mennonite congregations. The town is also home to a Buddhist temple. The city&#x27;s cultural influences include Filipino, Finnish, Lebanese, Korean and Japanese immigrants. Since the 1940s, Reedley has seen a large increase in its Hispanic and Latino immigrant population, who have come to represent the majority of Reedley&#x27;s ethnic makeup.

In 1988, Reedley celebrated the first 100 years since the construction of its Southern Pacific depot, and the 75th anniversary of incorporation. In 2013, the city celebrated its centennial.

===Reedley National Bank===

===Mid Valley Times===
Reedley&#x27;s downtown is the home of the local newspaper the &quot;Mid Valley Times&quot;, formerly known as the &quot;Reedley Exponent&quot;. The &quot;Exponent&quot; merged with the &quot;Sanger Herald&quot; and the &quot;Dinuba Sentinel&quot; in July 2019 in order to improve circulation.

===Jansen Opera House===

The building that houses the Opera House was built in 1903, after a fire destroyed two blocks of downtown Reedley. Danish grain merchant, Jesse Jansen, rallied the downtown shopkeepers to rebuild Reedley&#x27;s downtown out of brick. The Opera House itself was built at Jansen&#x27;s personal expense to serve as a cultural and community center. In 1913, the population of Reedley met at the Opera House to vote for incorporation. After the early 1920s, movie houses replaced the popularity of theatre, and the building went into disuse until restoration in 1986. The City of Reedley acquired the building in 2002 by donation.

In 2003, the River City Theatre Company was founded by Mark Norwood, who served as artistic director until his retirement in 2016. The River City Theatre Company currently leases the Opera House and produces musicals and stage plays.

==History and culture==
Selma owes its beginnings as the second city in Fresno County to farming and to the Southern Pacific Railroad, which began in the 1870s as a branch line of the Central Pacific Railroad. The route of the Southern Pacific through California&#x27;s Central Valley gave rise to a string of small towns between Sacramento and Bakersfield. Selma was among them.

In 1880, residents of the rural community that would become Selma established the Valley View School District. The first post office opened in 1880. A decade later, four farmers – Jacob E. Whitson, Egbert H. Tucker, George Otis and Monroe Snyder – formed a partnership and developed a townsite along the railroad. They began auctioning lots and just three years later the city of Selma was formally incorporated.

A persistent local legend is that Selma was named after Selma Gruenberg Lewis (–1944) by Governor Leland Stanford, who was shown her picture by her father. As Lewis first told the story in 1925, Stanford, also a Director of the Central Pacific Railroad, was so taken that he ordered that the next town on the line be named for her. Lewis often repeated the story with further romantic embellishments, and it came to be accepted as fact despite a lack of documentary evidence. Lewis is buried in Floral Memorial Park in Selma, and her marker repeats the story. Subsequent investigation indicates instead that the town was in fact named for Selma Michelsen (1853–1910), wife of a railroad employee who had submitted her name for inclusion on a list of candidate names prepared by his supervisor. George Otis selected the name from this list, in consultation with other local businessmen.

Along with Fowler to its immediate north and Kingsburg to its south, Selma was a railroad stop where agricultural goods could be loaded for shipping. As in the rest of the United States, the railroad played a lesser role as the 20th century progressed. What was once a handsome passenger terminal in Selma&#x27;s downtown became the city&#x27;s police station.

In the late 19th century, the town also boasted a water-driven mill for grinding wheat to flour. The mill was powered by the C&amp;K Canal, a seasonal irrigation channel that was known in Selma as the Mill Ditch. Groundwater Irrigation Beginnings had its start in Selma. It was here where the San Joaquin Valley&#x27;s groundwater reservoir was first tapped with a pumping plant. William De La Grange of Selma was tired of irrigationists draining Kings River water from the canal he used so he drilled an open bottom well. With the plant attracting attention, groundwater irrigation was common and pumps were powered by electricity.

===Agribusiness===
Wheat growing was Selma&#x27;s first economic engine but was replaced by orchards and vineyards when farmers realized how well peaches, plums, and grapes grew in the sandy soil, irrigated with snow-melt water imported through canals from the nearby Sierra Nevada mountain range.

Although raisins soon became the major crop, Selma called itself the &quot;Home of the Peach&quot; and was also known as &quot;A Peach of a City.&quot; Through the 1960s, the local peach cannery, where Libby&#x27;s-brand fruit was packed, was a major seasonal employer. Peaches and other tree fruit are still grown in abundance.

With 90 percent of U.S. raisins produced within of Selma, the city adopted the slogan &quot;Raisin Capital of the World&quot; in 1963. Area vineyards also produce table grapes. A decline in family farming, the national trend in U.S. agriculture after World War II, and depressed prices for raisins and table grapes, especially in the last decades of the twentieth century, were drains on the Selma-area agribusiness economy. Harris Ranch is based in Selma.

===Shifting business center===
Like many other American cities, Selma suffered a decline in its old downtown in the late decades of the 20th century and into the 21st century. Post–World War II development spread the growing city to the north and east, away from its business center. U.S. Highway 99, once a main road running north–south through town, parallel to the railroad, was rebuilt as a freeway (now SR 99) in the 1960s. Several blocks to the west of the old road (now Whitson Street and Golden State Boulevard), the freeway bisects the oldest residential neighborhood in Selma. Freeway travel made the new shopping malls of Fresno more accessible. The freeway also made Selma more attractive as a place to live for Fresno workers, who contributed to ever-faster residential growth into the 21st century.

The downtown experienced one of its biggest changes when Walmart built a large retail store at the intersection of East Floral Avenue and the freeway—at the northwest edge of town. As the 21st century began, this area became the &quot;de facto&quot; commercial center of the city providing great economic benefits. The old downtown, despite vacant storefronts, remained a struggling but viable district of city offices and small businesses.

===Media===
The weekly newspaper is &quot;The Selma Enterprise&quot;. Residents are also served by the daily &quot;Fresno Bee&quot; and by Fresno-based television and radio stations.

===Public schools===
The Selma Unified School District has eight neighborhood elementary schools. Students from all of these schools are channeled to Abraham Lincoln Middle School and continue on to Selma High School or two alternative high schools. Selma High School fields a range of sports teams nicknamed the Bears. School colors are orange and black. The yearbook is entitled the &quot;Magnet&quot;.

==Notable people==
Well-known people who have lived in and around Selma include 19th-century inventors Frank Dusy, Abijah McCall and William Deidrick; the poets William Everson (Brother Antoninus, 1912–94) and Larry Levis (1946–96); William R. Shockley (1918–1945), recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor in World War II; author–historian Victor Davis Hanson (1953– ); and Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox (1941– ). Clarence Berry (1867–1930), who struck it rich in the Klondike Gold Rush of 1897 and became known as an innovative mining engineer and businessman, had earlier been a fruit farmer in Selma. Also known as C.J. Berry, he left Selma for Canada&#x27;s Yukon Territory after he was forced to declare bankruptcy. Beatrice Kozera (1920–2013), born Beatrice Rentería, also spent much of her childhood in Selma where her family worked in the fields. In 1947, she met Jack Kerouac who represented her as &quot;The Mexican Girl&quot; in &quot;On the Road&quot; where Selma is referred to as Sabinal. Frankie A. Rodriguez (1996– ), an actor from the Disney franchise &quot;High School Musical: The Musical: The Series&quot;, is also from Selma.

<text>Yokuts Valley, formerly Squaw Valley, is a unincorporated community located in Fresno County, California, at the foothills of the Sierra Nevada on State Route 180 just below Kings Canyon National Park.

As of the 2010 census, the CDP had a total population of 3,162, up from 2,691 at the 2000 census. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau defined Squaw Valley as a census-designated place (CDP). Yokuts Valley is located north-northeast of Orange Cove and east of Fresno, at an elevation of .

==Name==
The Chukimena, the Yokuts tribe that occupied the valley before American colonization, named it Múshtihnau, after their main village. The nearby Éntimbits Yokuts tribe called the valley, Túcheu. The label &quot;Valley&quot; originally referred to either the surrounding basin or a narrow valley that connects it to the San Joaquin Valley. Today it refers to both. The basin may have originally been named &quot;Woman&#x27;s Land&quot;, after a depression in a rock overlooking the valley that resembles a woman&#x27;s moccasin print. By 1873, non-native hunters adapted the name in English to &quot;Squaw Valley&quot;, because &quot;squaw&quot; was the term used by white settlers for Indigenous women; it is considered a slur by natives. The United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN) officially assigned the name &quot;Squaw Valley&quot; to the community in 1957 and to the basin in 1959.

On August 28, 1958, at the behest of Representative B. F. Sisk, the BGN decided that &quot;Squaw Valley&quot; would only refer to this community, not to a newer community in Placer County that was about to host the 1960 Winter Olympics. The latter would become known as Olympic Valley. Nevertheless, the name &quot;Squaw Valley&quot; continued to refer informally to both communities, creating considerable confusion.

From 2020 to 2023, a coalition that included members of local tribes petitioned the Fresno County Board of Supervisors to rename the community &quot;Nuum Valley&quot; and later &quot;Yokuts Valley&quot;, citing the derogatory history of the town&#x27;s previous name.

In September 2022, the Board on Geographic Names renamed the surrounding valley to Yokuts Basin as part of a program to remove &quot;squaw&quot; from geographical names across the country. A Fresno County Supervisor, Republican Nathan Magsig, solicited feedback from 1,400 households about the proposed renaming and says they prefer Bear Valley. He organized a town hall meeting with local activists that turned contentious. Arguments against the name change ranged from procedural to political. Some opposed it simply for the fact that the new name had not been chosen by residents, ironic to the native tribes who still live in the area. Others refused to accept that the word &quot;squaw&quot; is considered derogatory by others. Arguments in favor of the change came from Native activists and white residents of the town who wanted their home cleared of a name that degraded Indigenous women.

A few days later, Governor Gavin Newsom signed a law directing state and local authorities to remove &quot;squaw&quot; from geographic features and place names throughout the state, including &quot;Squaw Valley&quot;, by 2025. In October, the Fresno County Board of Supervisors passed a resolution that acknowledged the state and federal renaming efforts while notifying the federal government that 87% of households that responded to Supervisor Magsig&#x27;s survey opposed renaming the community.

In January 2023, the Board on Geographic Names completed additional review on renaming the unincorporated populated place to &quot;Yokuts Valley.&quot; In February, a prominent welcome sign bearing the previous name was removed, prompting some local residents to call for its restoration.

==History==
Present-day Yokuts Valley was originally the home of Yokuts and Mono people. In 1869, the Simpson Drake family became the first recorded non-Indigenous family to settle in the basin. An early reference to Yokuts Valley appears in an 1884 issue of an Idaho newspaper.

The first post office opened in &quot;Squaw Valley&quot; in 1879. It was renamed Squawvalley in 1895 before closing in 1918. It reopened in 1923, renamed back to Squaw Valley in 1932, and closed again in 1945 in favor of the nearby Orange Cove post office. The &quot;Squaw Valley&quot; post office was established a third time in 1960.

In the 1960s, the community moved east to its current location. In 1994, the Fresno County Public Library&#x27;s Bear Mountain Branch Library relocated to the community from Dunlap, where it had been since 1915.

==Geography==

Scenes for several films used for training pilots and aircrew members were produced at Orland. Constructed of a large square of thick, reinforced concrete, most of the airfield is now a civil airport operated by Glenn County.

<text>Arcata (; ; ) is a city adjacent to the Arcata Bay (northern) portion of Humboldt Bay in Humboldt County, California, United States. At the 2020 census, Arcata&#x27;s population was 18,857. Arcata was first founded in 1850 as Union, was officially established in 1858, and was renamed Arcata in 1860. It is located north of San Francisco (via Highway 101), and is home to California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt. Arcata is also the location of the Arcata Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Land Management, which is responsible for the administration of natural resources, lands and mineral programs, including the Headwaters Forest, on approximately of public land in Northwestern California.

==History==

===Indigenous Native American===
The Wiyot people and Yurok people inhabited this area prior to the arrival of Europeans and continue to live in the area. &quot;Kori&quot; is the name for the Wiyot settlement that existed on the site of what would become Arcata. The name &quot;Arcata&quot; comes from the Yurok term &quot;oket&#x27;oh&quot;, meaning &quot;where there is a lagoon&quot; (referring to Humboldt Bay), from &quot;o-&quot;, &quot;place&quot;, plus &quot;ket&#x27;oh&quot;, &quot;to be a lagoon&quot;. The same name was also used by the Yuroks for Big Lagoon. The natives of this region are the farthest-southwest people whose language has Algic roots, a language family shared with the Algonquian. The traditional homeland of the Wiyot ranged from the Little River in the north and continues south through Humboldt Bay (including the present cities of Eureka and Arcata) and then south to the lower Eel River basin. The traditional homeland of the Yurok ranges from Mad River to beyond the Klamath River in the north. Today, Arcata is the headquarters of the Big Lagoon Rancheria tribe, who maintain a reservation close by. Local Indian tribes operate several casinos in the area.
In a coordinated 1860 massacre, significant numbers of Wiyot people were killed by white settlers at several locations in and around Humboldt Bay, including the center of their society, the island known to them as Duluwat Island. A local newspaper editor, who would later be known as Bret Harte, was forced to leave the Humboldt Bay area after he editorialized his disgust with the incident.

===Westernization===

The Spaniards claimed the area but never settled it; the first permanent settlements occurred after California was admitted to the Union. Arcata was first settled as Union in 1850. Union was created as a port, and reprovisioning center for the gold mines in the Klamath, Trinity, and Salmon mountains to the east, and was very briefly the county seat during this period. It was slightly closer to the mines than Eureka, which gave Union an early advantage. What was to become the first significant town on Humboldt Bay began as Union Company employees laid out the plaza and first city streets in the Spring of 1850. By later in the 1850s redwood timber replaced the depleted gold fields as the economic driver for the region and Eureka became the principal city on the bay due to its possession of the better harbor, gaining it the county seat by the end of the decade.

The Union town post office opened in 1852, and the town changed its name to Arcata in 1860.

In 1886, concern over the growing number of unassimilated immigrants led Arcata to expel its Chinese population and enact the following resolution: &quot;We, the citizens of
Arcata and vicinity, wish the total expulsion of the Chinese from our midst. We endorse the efforts of
Eureka to exclude all Chinese settlements in the city and environs.&quot;

History and images of early settler families in Arcata are cataloged in the Susie Baker Fountain Papers and True Hoyle Collection at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt. These collections also include images of important social events in the Arcata area, such as graduations at Arcata High School as early as 1910, as well as images of social gatherings at the Arcata plaza before the statue of William McKinley was erected in the center from 1906 until its relocation in 2019.

===Recent history===
Since the 1970s, Arcata has been home to multiple major manufacturing companies, specifically in the outdoor industry. Yakima Racks, a major car racks and bike accessories company, was headquartered in Arcata from 1979 to 2005, when the company moved to Oregon. Moonstone Mountaineering, founded out of a van at Moonstone Beach in 1977, was a major innovator in down sleeping bags, waterproof gear, and fleece before being bought and closed by Columbia Sportswear in 2006. Kokatat, founded as Blue Puma in 1971 and renamed in 1986, is a major watersports clothing company headquartered in Arcata that specializes in waterproof apparel for kayaking, and outfits the US Coast Guard, Navy SEALs, and SWCC, US watersports teams for 1992 and 1996 Summer Olympics and the movie The Bodyguard. Wing Inflatables, founded in Arcata in 1991, manufactures polyurethane Inflatables boats used by riverboat tours, as well Navy SEALs, Coast Guard, NOAA, and NASA.

In August 1989, the voters of Arcata passed the Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Act, prohibiting work on nuclear weapons, and the storage or transportation of nuclear weapons within the city limits. The ordinance also minimized the city&#x27;s contracts for and purchases of the products and services of nuclear weapons contractors. On March 17, 2010, the Arcata city council voted for final passage of an unlawful-panhandling ordinance (Ordinance No. 1399). Among other restrictions, it forbids panhandling within of any business.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , comprising 17.25%, is water.

Arcata contains major public and shopping areas within the city. They include: the Downtown/Plaza Area, Northtown, and Valley West (each of these are also large neighborhoods). There are additional named neighborhoods encompassed by the city: They include: Aldergrove, Alliance (which was once a separate community located North of Arcata), Arcata Bottoms, portions of Bayside (despite it having its own Post Office and postal code), Bayview, California Heights, the Creamery District, Fickle Hill (lower portions), Greenview, the Marsh District (aka South G Street), Redwood Park (which includes the City-owned Redwood forest), Sunny Brae, Sunset, and Westwood. Arcata also has the Arcata Marsh, a preserve located on the city&#x27;s bay shore.
===Climate===
Arcata has a cool-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;), which is dominated by marine influences associated with Humboldt Bay and the Pacific Ocean. These influences make the climate in the city much cooler than that of a typical Mediterranean climate and more on par with that of an oceanic climate. On average, Arcata experiences of rain per year, though there is a short but pronounced dry season from June to September. Northerly winds keep the spring very cool and create a coastal upwelling of deep, cold, ocean water. This upwelling in turn results in foggy conditions throughout the summer, with high temperatures commonly in the 50s and low 60s. Yet just a few miles inland the temperatures may be up to degrees warmer in the summer and fall. This is even more pronounced further inland in the Trinity River valley.

Winter high temperatures average in the low 40s to mid-50s, with lows in the mid-30s to lower 40s. Temperatures infrequently dip below in the winter, and nearly as infrequently climb above in the summer and fall.

Arcata has higher record temperatures than county seat Eureka, although averages are very similar.

==Demographics==

===Logging bust===

Changing populations have happened in timber and mining towns in the American West as a result of boom and bust economic cycles. Some towns decrease in population following a bust, while some, like Arcata, experience a change in demographics. In the case of Arcata, the peak and the bust were close due to Arcata&#x27;s relatively late entry into the timber industry, and its domination by mechanization. The population of the city of Arcata was 3,729 during its peak 1950, when lumber was exported throughout the country and abroad. For the County of Humboldt, the age distribution for urban residents, which would include Arcata, had 23.7% of the population under the age of 15. Those that would be considered young workers (age 15–24) made up 14% of the population. &quot;Normal&quot; aged workers (age 25–39) made up 23.9% of the population. Older working age (age 40–54) made up 19.4% of the population. Pre-retirement aged (age 55–64) made up 9.7% of the population. Those of retirement age (age 65 and older) made up 9.1% of the population. For Arcata specifically, those age 65 and older were 8.3% of the population in 1950, and the median age was 29.4 years.

After the bust in 1955, the population of Arcata in 1960 was 5,235. In Arcata the population under the age of 15 was 28.1%. Those age 15–24 made up 22.8% of Arcata&#x27;s population. Those age 25–39 made up 19.4% of the population. Those age 40–54 made up 16% of Arcata&#x27;s population. Those age 55–64 made up 6.7% of Arcata&#x27;s population. Those age 65 and over made up 6.9% of Arcata&#x27;s population.

Overall, census data reflects a lowering in the age of the Arcata population, due to an influx of young workers, due to there not being enough time after the bust for older workers to leave, in the decade between 1950 and 1960, during which the timber industry peaked and busted.

===2000 Census data===
As of the census of 2000, there were 16,651 people, 7,051 households, and 2,813 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 7,272 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city in 2010 is 76.3% non-Hispanic White, 1.9% non-Hispanic Black or African American, 1.9% Native American, 2.5% Asian, 0.2% Pacific Islander, 0.6% from other races, and 5.0% from two or more races. 11.6% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

The composition of Arcata&#x27;s households reflects the large number of unrelated college-age students living together. Of the 7,051 households in Arcata, only 19.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, only 25.9% were married couples living together, 10.4% had a female householder with no husband present, while 60.1% were non-families. 34.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.16 and the average family size was 2.81.

Arcata&#x27;s age cohorts are also distorted by a large percentage of college-age students. Only 15.3% of Arcata residents are under the age of 18, while nearly a third (32.3%) fall between ages 18 and 24, and 27.8% are 25 to 44 years old. Among older age cohorts, 15.9% are 45 to 64 years old, and 8.7% were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 26 years. For every 100 females, there were 99.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.9 males.

As of 2002, there were 8,210 employed persons living in Arcata and an unemployment rate of 7.2%. For many years the timber industry dominated Arcata&#x27;s economy. Today, the majority of Arcata jobs come from government (including schools and Cal Poly Humboldt), the city&#x27;s many owner-resident small businesses, some lumber and food manufacturing, and a wide variety of service industries (ranging from professional services to restaurant and hospitality). A large but unmeasurable cannabis economy employs many in Arcata and the surrounding area. The area&#x27;s economy and population are both growing more slowly than the State of California overall.

Median reported household income in Arcata was $22,315, and the median income for a family was $36,716. Males had a median income of $26,577 versus $24,358 for females. The per capita income for the city was $15,531, however this figure may be artificially low due to the large student population. About 14.3% of families and 32.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 22.4% of those under age 18 and 6.0% of those age 65 or over.

==Arts and culture==

The heart of Arcata is the Plaza. In the 1850s the Plaza was where goods destined for the Trinity County mines were loaded onto mule trains. The Plaza has a green lawn, extensive flower plantings, and at its center there used to be a statue of president William McKinley by Haig Patigian. The Plaza is surrounded by bookstores, bars, coffee shops, restaurants, and live music venues. The Plaza is also the center of Humboldt County&#x27;s largest farmers&#x27; market, and serves as a major venue for local Fourth of July festivities, the Arcata Main Street Oyster Festival, the start of the Kinetic Sculpture Race, and the North Country Fair. The North Country Fair Samba Parade has been a community favorite since 1986. The Plaza is also a popular rendezvous point for travelers who stop off in Arcata. The annual Explorations in Afro-Cuban Dance and Drum workshop is held every summer on the CPH campus. The workshop hosts the largest assemblage of Afro-Cuban folkloric music and dance masters in the United States.

The statue of William McKinley has been a point of controversy since the 1970s. Opponents of the statue condemned McKinley&#x27;s supposed support of settler colonialism and policies that led to the slaughter of Native Americans. Supporters of the statue emphasized its historical significance as a major part of the culture of Arcata. In February 2018, the Arcata City Council voted to remove the statue from the Plaza, a decision supported in November 2018 when a referendum to block the statue&#x27;s removal was defeated. In February 2019, the Arcata City Council approved a measure to relocate the statue to the William McKinley Presidential Library and Museum in Canton, Ohio, and on February 28, the statue was removed from the Plaza in preparation for its relocation.

Arcata also features a large number of original Victorian structures, many of which have been restored.
The Wiyot people, the original inhabitants of the area, call the Plaza &quot;Goad-la-nah&quot; for the &quot;land a little above the water&quot;.

Arcata&#x27;s Minor Theater is one of the oldest movies-only theaters in the United States which is still in operation. It is also home to the Arcata Theatre.

==Parks and recreation==
The Arcata Marsh, a constructed network of freshwater and saltwater ponds initially completed in 1979, demonstrates a revolutionary marsh-based wastewater treatment system. The marsh was built on a retired municipal solid waste dump and has received many awards, including the &quot;Innovations in Government&quot; award from the Ford Foundation and Harvard Kennedy School. The marsh is a popular destination for cyclists, bird watchers, transients, and joggers, and was recently expanded as a part of the McDaniel Slough restoration project.

The City owns a total of of forest land, including the Arcata Community Forest, the Sunny Brae Forest, and the Jacoby Creek Forest. Arcata&#x27;s community forest lands have been the subject of national media attention. The Arcata Community Forest was originally acquired by the City in order to protect the integrity of its municipal water supply. Upon acquisition in 1955, The Arcata Community Forest was dedicated as the first city-owned community forest in the State of California. Since then it has served many functions including recreation, education, sustainable timber harvesting, and wildlife habitat. The forest serves as the headwaters of many of Arcata&#x27;s urban streams. In 1979, the citizens of Arcata passed the &quot;Forest Management and Parkland Initiative.&quot; The intent of the legislation was to develop a responsible and ecologically sensitive long-term forest management program, which would provide timber-harvest revenues for the acquisition and development of City parkland. In 1998 the Arcata Community Forest was the first municipal forest certified in the U.S. under the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Since that time additional acreage has been protected, such as the Sunny Brae Forest acquisition in 2006, and the 2009 receipt of a donated conservation easement adjacent to the Arcata Community Forest&#x27;s northern boundary in the upper Janes Creek watershed.

==Government==
The city of Arcata has a Council-Manager form of government, with a City Council of five members, which is the legislative policy-making branch of city government. Each Council member is elected at large (i.e., by all voting Arcata residents) for a four-year term. Members are allowed to run for re-election, and there is no limit on how many terms a person may serve. The Council directs the course of local government through its power to adopt ordinances, levy taxes, award contracts, and appoint certain city officers, commissions and committees.

Arcata has been notably progressive in its political makeup, and was the first city in the United States to elect a majority of its city council members from the Green Party. As a result of the progressive majority, Arcata capped the number of chain restaurants allowed in the city. Arcata was also the first municipality to ban the growth of any type of Genetically Modified Organism within city limits, with exceptions for research and educational purposes.

===Politics===

In the state legislature, Arcata is in , and .

Federally, Arcata is in .

Arcata voters are among the most Democratic in Humboldt County. In the 2008 United States presidential election, Republican candidate John McCain received less than 10% of the popular vote in many Arcata precincts, while in those same precincts Democratic candidate Barack Obama received 85% or more of the vote. Arcata is a hub of liberal thought typical of a college town, a place where environmentalism and social activism are broadly embraced. Humboldt County fits the statewide trend of increasingly liberal coastal counties and conservative interior counties, but some conservative voters remain. College students have, at times, been mayor or city council members.

Arcata was the first city to have a Green Party majority in its city council. Arcata is also one of three cities in California and one of four cities in the United States ever to have held a Green Party majority in their city councils.

In August 1989, the voters of Arcata passed the Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Act, prohibiting activities benefiting nuclear weapons contractors within city jurisdictional limits.

Arcata residents are active in regional environmental protection, and played a contributing role in the successful effort to preserve the Headwaters Forest from logging. The north coast region is often divided on environmental issues, with conflicts arising between residents and landowners who have made a living harvesting the area&#x27;s natural resources, and residents aiming to preserve the region&#x27;s natural habitats.

Arcata is on the path to decriminalizing most psychedelic entheogenic substances.

==Education==

Arcata is the site of California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, the northernmost campus of the 23-campus California State University system. With a student body equaling nearly half the city&#x27;s total population, Arcata is a classic example of a traditional &quot;college town.&quot; The city center is from the university center and takes about 16 minutes to walk.

The primary public high school is Arcata High School, with a total population of 827 for the 2012–2013 school year. The high school is located at 1720 M Street in Arcata, and is part of the Northern Humboldt Union High School District. The school offers a number of programs, including an Advanced Placement program, special programs through the Arcata Arts Institute, and a variety of student clubs.

==Media==
The &quot;Eureka Times-Standard&quot; is the only major regional daily publication covering Arcata. &quot;The Arcata Eye&quot; was a former weekly newspaper covering Arcata and Blue Lake until it merged with the McKinleyville Press newspaper in 2013 to become the &quot;Mad River Union&quot;. The Northcoast Environmental Center, located in Arcata, has published &quot;Econews&quot; as a monthly journal since 1971. CPH produces a weekly student-run paper titled &quot;The Lumberjack&quot;, a student-run, general-interest magazine, the &quot;Osprey&quot;, published once a semester, and &quot;El Leñador,&quot; Cal Poly Humboldt&#x27;s first bilingual, student-run newspaper. Arcata is also home to CPH&#x27;s student-run radio station, KRFH 105.1 FM, which is notable for being one of a select few freeform radio stations still on the air today. The town has a number of small &#x27;zines and blogs that cover a variety of local issues, including youth culture and homelessness.

==Transportation==

===Roads===
U.S. Route 101 extends north and south and bisects the city. The downtown has several overcrossings; Arcata is considered a fairly walkable community. State Route 299 connects to U.S. Route 101 at the northern end of Arcata. SR 299 begins at this point and extends easterly towards Weaverville, Redding, Alturas, and Nevada. SR 255 connects to U.S. Route 101 at the southern end of Arcata on Samoa Blvd. and to the west of US-101 passes through Manila. Bridge access (left at first controlled intersection) leads to Eureka through Woodley island and Tuluwat island (using three bridges) ending on 4th (south 101) and 5th (north 101) streets in Eureka, CA. Used as an alternate route to the US-101, its speed limit is though, unlike the speed on Highway 101 – which from the Bayside cutoff to Gallagher lane north 101 and x street south 101 is due to a safety corridor.

The highways connecting Arcata to areas outside Humboldt County include long segments of winding two-lane road traversing remote mountains and river canyons, portions of which may close after extensive rain and wind storms, requiring possibly long detours. While Arcata, Eureka, Fortuna and the Redwood Coast region are part of the most populous state in the US, the Redwood Coast region is also one of the most remote locations along the continental US west coast. The city also offers several cycling trails.

===Transit===
Redwood Transit System (RTS) is the major provider of public bus transportation in Humboldt County, with several stops in Arcata. Arcata and Mad River Transit Service (AMRTS) is the local bus and serves Arcata and Sunny Brae. Dial-A-Ride service is available from Humboldt Senior Resource Center through an application process.

Transit and long-haul bus services, including Amtrak and Greyhound, use the Arcata Transit Center at 925 E Street as their central interchange point for Arcata.

The Amtrak Thruway 7 bus provides daily connections to/from Arcata and Martinez to the south, including stops at points in between along the Highway 101 corridor. Additional Amtrak connections are available from Martinez station.

===Air===
The closest airport is the Arcata-Eureka Airport located in McKinleyville. This airport was built by the Army Air Corps in World War II in a particularly foggy location, as a site to test fog dispersal techniques. No successful dispersal method appears to have been found, and after demobilization the airfield was given to the County of Humboldt as a civilian airport. This airport is one of the foggiest in the world, resulting in frequent flight delays or cancellations. Some arriving flights are diverted to Redding, California, a three-hour drive to the east, or Crescent City, about to the north.

===Water===
There is a deep-water port in nearby Eureka. In 1854, the Union Wharf and Plank Walk Company built redwood plank and rails out into the deeper water of Arcata Bay, providing Arcata with a deep-water seaport. This was initially a horse-drawn railroad, though it was later converted to steam. This eventually became the Arcata and Mad River Railroad (now defunct). Arcata&#x27;s wharf is long gone, and only a few piers can be seen at low tide. Some very small recreational boats can be launched from the foot of I street at the Arcata Marsh at high tide. However, at low tide Arcata Bay becomes a vast mud flat and a challenge to boaters.

<text>Eureka ( ; Wiyot: ; Hupa: ; ) is a city and the county seat of Humboldt County, located on the North Coast of California. The city is located on U.S. Route 101 on the shores of Humboldt Bay, north of San Francisco and south of the Oregon border. At the 2020 census, the population of the city was 26,512 and the population of the greater Eureka area was 48,119.

Eureka is the largest coastal city between San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, and the westernmost city of more than 25,000 residents in the 48 contiguous states. The proximity to the sea causes the city to have an extremely maritime climate with very small annual temperature differences and seasons mainly being defined by the rainy winters and dry summers, whereas nearby inland areas are much hotter in summer. It is the regional center for government, health care, trade, and the arts on the North Coast north of the San Francisco Bay Area. Greater Eureka, one of California&#x27;s major commercial fishing ports, is the location of the largest deep-water port between San Francisco and Coos Bay, a stretch of about .

The headquarters of both the Six Rivers National Forest and the North Coast Redwoods District of the California State Parks System are in Eureka. As entrepôt for hundreds of lumber mills that once existed in the area, the city played a leading role in the historic West Coast lumber trade. The entire city is a state historic landmark, which has hundreds of significant Victorian homes, including the nationally recognized Carson Mansion, and the city has retained its original 19th-century commercial core as a nationally recognized Old Town Historic District. Eureka is home to California&#x27;s oldest zoo, the Sequoia Park Zoo.

== History ==

=== Native Americans ===
The Wiyot people lived in , now known as Eureka, for thousands of years before European arrival.Their traditional coastal homeland ranges from the Little River in the north to Bear River Ridge in the south, including the entire coastline of Humboldt Bay, stretching inland to the mountains. The Wiyot people are particularly known for their basketry and fishery management. An extensive collection of intricate basketry of the area&#x27;s indigenous groups exists in the Clarke Historical Museum in Old Town Eureka.

The Yurok people share linguistic and cultural practices with the Wiyot people, and their traditional territory is located to the north of Eureka. The Yurok Tribe&#x27;s language revitalization program is seen by many as the most successful of its kind in California, and , Eureka High School has the largest Yurok language program of any school.

===Founding on Humboldt Bay===

For nearly 300 years after 1579, European exploration of the coast of what would become northern California repeatedly missed definitively locating Humboldt Bay because of a combination of geographic features and weather conditions which concealed the narrow bay entrance from view. Despite a well-documented 1806 sighting by Russian explorers, the bay was not definitively known by Europeans until an 1849 overland exploration provided a reliable accounting of the exact location of what is the second-largest bay in California. The timing of this discovery led to the May 13, 1850, founding of the settlement of Eureka on its shore by the Union and Mendocino Exploring (development) companies.

===Gold Rush era===

After the primary California Gold Rush in the Sierras, Humboldt Bay was settled with the intent of providing a convenient alternative to the long overland route from Sacramento to supply miners on the Trinity, Klamath and Salmon Rivers where gold had been discovered. Though the ideal location on Humboldt Bay adjacent to naturally deeper shipping channels ultimately guaranteed Eureka&#x27;s development as the primary city on the bay, Arcata&#x27;s proximity to developing supply lines to inland gold mines ensured supremacy over Eureka through 1856.

&quot;Eureka&quot; received its name from a Greek word meaning &quot;I have found it!&quot; This exuberant statement of successful (or hopeful) gold rush miners is also the official motto of the State of California. Eureka is the only U.S. location to use the same seal as the state for its seal.

===Wiyot Massacre===

Incoming settlers began encroaching on Wiyot people by cutting off their access to ancestral sources of food in addition to the outright theft of their land. Fort Humboldt was established by the U.S. Army on January 30, 1853, to establish peaceful relations between Native Americans, gold-seekers and settlers, often at the expense of the life and liberty of the Native people. The fort was commanded by Brevet Lieutenant Colonel Robert C. Buchanan of the U.S. 4th Infantry Regiment. These tensions between Native people and settlers eventually led to the massacre on Tuluwat Island in 1860. The attackers, who were thought to be composed primarily of Eureka businessmen, killed as many as 250 Wiyot people. The Wiyot men had left the island during their annual World Renewal Ceremony, so the victims were primarily children, women, and elderly tribal members. Major Gabriel J. Rains, Commanding Officer of Fort Humboldt at the time, reported to his commanding officer that a local group of vigilantes had resolved to &quot;kill every peaceable Indian – man, woman, and child.&quot; Although the perpetrators were known, they never faced any legal consequences. Remaining Wiyot people took refuge at Fort Humboldt, but they were not given adequate living accommodations, and so half of them died from starvation or exposure.

In 2004, the City of Eureka voted unanimously to return of Tuluwat Island to the Wiyot Tribe as an act of reparation, representing a historic victory for the Land Back movement.

===Lumber industry===
Eureka&#x27;s first post office opened in 1853 just as the town began to carve its grid plan into the edge of a forest it would ultimately consume to feed the building of San Francisco and points beyond. Many of the first immigrants who arrived as prospectors were also lumbermen, and the vast potential for industry on the bay was soon realized, especially as many hopeful gold miners realized the difficulty and infrequency of striking it rich in the mines. By 1854, after only four years since the founding, seven of nine mills processing timber into marketable lumber on Humboldt Bay were within Eureka. A year later, 140 lumber schooners operated in and out of Humboldt Bay moving lumber from the mills to booming cities along the Pacific coast. By the time the charter for Eureka was granted in 1856, busy mills inside the city had a daily production capacity of 220,000 board feet. This level of production, which would grow significantly and continue for more than a century, secured Eureka as the &quot;timber capital&quot; of California. Eureka was at the apex of rapid growth of the lumber industry because of its location between huge coast redwood forests and its control of the primary port facilities. Loggers brought the enormous redwood trees down. Dozens of movable narrow gauge railroads brought trainloads of logs and finished lumber products to the main rail line, which led directly to Eureka&#x27;s wharf and waiting schooners. By the 1880s, railroads eventually brought the production of hundreds of mills throughout the region to Eureka, primarily for shipment through its port. After the early 1900s, shipment of products occurred by trucks, trains, and ships from Eureka, Humboldt Bay, and other points in the region, but Eureka remained the busy center of all this activity for over 120 years. These factors and others made Eureka a significant city in early California state history.

===Commercial center===
A bustling commercial district with ornate Victorian-style buildings rose in proximity to the waterfront, reflecting the great prosperity experienced during this era. Hundreds of these Victorian homes remain today, of which many are totally restored and a few have always remained in their original elegance and splendor. The representation of these homes in Eureka, grouped with those in nearby Arcata and the Victorian village of Ferndale, are of considerable importance to the overall development of Victorian architecture built in the nation. The magnificent Carson Mansion on 2nd and M Streets is perhaps the most spectacular Victorian in the nation. The home was built between 1884 and 1886 by renowned 19th-century architects Newsom and Newsom for lumber baron William M. Carson. This project was designed to keep mill workers and expert craftsman busy during a slow period in the industry. Old Town Eureka, the original downtown center of this busy city in the 19th century, has been restored and has become a lively arts center. The Old Town area has been declared an Historic District by the National Register of Historic Places. The district is made up of over 150 buildings, which in total represents much of Eureka&#x27;s original 19th-century core commercial center. This nexus of culture behind the redwood curtain still contains much of its Victorian architecture, which, if not maintained for original use as commercial buildings or homes, have been transformed into scores of unique lodgings, restaurants, and small shops featuring a burgeoning cottage industry of hand-made creations, from glassware to wood-burning stoves, and a large variety of locally created art.
===Fishing, shipping, and boating===
Eureka&#x27;s founding and livelihood was and remains linked to Humboldt Bay, the Pacific Ocean, and related industries, especially fishing. Salmon fisheries sprang up along the Eel River as early as 1851, and, within seven years, 2,000 barrels of cured fish and of smoked salmon were processed and shipped out of Humboldt Bay annually from processing plants on Eureka&#x27;s wharf. In 1858, the first of many ships built in Eureka was launched, beginning an industry that spanned scores of years. The bay is also the site of the West Coast&#x27;s largest oyster farming operations, which began its commercial status in the nineteenth century. Eureka is the home port to more than 100 fishing vessels (with an all-time high of over 400 in 1981) in two modern marinas which can berth approximately 400 boats within the city limits and at least 50 more in nearby Fields Landing, which is part of Greater Eureka. Area catches historically include, among other species, salmon, tuna, Dungeness crab, and shrimp, with historic annual total fishing landings totaling about in 1981.

===Chinese expulsion===

Racist views of Chinese immigrants in the late 19th century led to violent attacks on them by White settlers across the West, both before and after the Chinese Exclusion Act. Economic downturns resulting in competition for jobs fed sinophobia and violent actions against Chinese immigrants, especially on the Pacific coast. In February 1885, Eureka City Councilman David Kendall was caught in the crossfire of two rival Chinese gangs and killed. A group of 600 White vigilantes forcibly and permanently evicted all 480 Chinese residents of Eureka&#x27;s Chinatown.

Among those who guarded the city jail during the height of the sinophobic tension was James Gillett, who went on to become Governor of California. The anti-Chinese ordinance was repealed in 1959.

=== Queen City of the Ultimate West ===

Completion of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad in 1914 provided the local lumber industry with an alternative to ships for transport of its millions of board feet of lumber to reach markets in San Francisco and beyond. It also provided the first safe land route between San Francisco and Eureka for people to venture to the Redwood Empire. As a result, Eureka&#x27;s population of 7,300 swelled to 15,000 within ten years. By 1922, the Redwood Highway was completed, providing for the first reliable, direct overland route for automobiles from San Francisco. By 1931, the Eureka Street Railway operated fifteen streetcars over of track. Eureka&#x27;s transportation connection to the &quot;outside&quot; world had changed dramatically after more than half a century of stage rides or treacherous steamship passage through the Humboldt Bar and on the Pacific Ocean to San Francisco. The building of the Eureka Inn coincided with the opening of the new road to San Francisco. As a result of immense civic pride during this early-20th-century era of expansion, Eureka officially nicknamed itself &quot;Queen City of the Ultimate West.&quot; The tourism industry, lodging to support it, and related marketing had been born.

===Post–World War II===
The timber economy of Eureka is part of the Pacific Northwest timber economy which rises and falls with boom-and-bust economic times. In Eureka, both the timber industry and commercial fishing declined after the Second World War.

The Columbus Day Storm of 1962 downed trees and caused a surplus in the domestic timber market, which caused increased shipping to foreign markets. The log trade with Japan and other Pacific Rim nations increased. Despite many rumors to the contrary, little of this wood returned to U.S. markets. In 1989, the U.S. changed log export laws, permitting lower-cost timber from public lands to be exported as raw logs overseas to help balance the federal budget.

After 1990, the global log market declined, and exports fell at the same time as Pacific Northwest log prices increased; leading buyers to seek less expensive logs from Canada and the southern United States. Debate continues among four stakeholders: timber owners, domestic processors, consumers and communities, on the impact of log export on the local economy. During the span of 1991 to 2001, timber harvest peaked in 1997. The local timber market was also affected by the Pacific Lumber Company hostile takeover and ultimate bankruptcy.

Local fisheries expanded through the 1970s and early 1980s. During the 1970s, Eureka fishermen landed more than half of the fish and shellfish produced and consumed in California. In 2010, between 100 and 120 commercial fishing vessels listed Eureka as homeport. The highest landings of all species were in 1981 while the lowest were in 2001 with .

After 1990 regulatory, economic, and other events led to a contraction of the local commercial fleet. In 1991, the Woodley Island marina opened, providing docking facilities for much of Eureka&#x27;s commercial and recreational fleet. Many species are considered to be overfished. Recreational fishing has increased over time. Fifty percent of recreational fishermen using local boats are tourists from outside the area.

Commercial Pacific oyster aquaculture in Humboldt Bay produced an average of of oysters from 1956 to 1965 an average of per year. In 2004, only were harvested. Oysters and oyster seed continue to be exported from Humboldt Bay. The value of the oysters and spawn is more than $6 million per year. Consolidation of buyers and landing facilities resulted in local vulnerability to unexpected events, leading the city to obtain grant funding for and complete the Fishermen&#x27;s Terminal on the waterfront which will provide fish handling, marketing, and public spaces.

===Significant earthquakes===
The area regularly experiences large earthquakes as it is situated on the southern end the Cascadia subduction zone and near the San Andreas Fault, which interface around the Mendocino triple junction. On December 20, 2022, a magnitude 6.4 earthquake struck Ferndale, California in Humboldt County, United States at 10:34:25 UTC, or 2:34 a.m. PST. On January 9, 2010, a 6.5 magnitude earthquake occurred about off shore from Eureka. After two seconds, it became a violent &quot;jumper&quot;, making objects fly; the mostly vertical shocks from the ground led to broken windows in shops, overturned shelving in homes and stores, and damage to architectural detail on a number of historic buildings. Local hospitals treated mostly minor related injuries, and electrical power was out over a large area. Numerous natural gas leaks occurred, but no fires resulted. This was the largest recent earthquake since the April 25–26, 1992 sequence. It was followed on February 4, 2010, by a magnitude 5.9 earthquake which struck about northwest of the community of Petrolia and nearly west of Eureka. The shaking was felt within a radius, as far north as southern Oregon and as far south as Sonoma County. The largest recorded in the area was the 7.2 event on November 8, 1980. The larger earthquakes can pose a tsunami threat to coastal areas.
== Geography ==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and or 35.07% is water.

Eureka is situated within California&#x27;s Redwood Empire region which includes Pacific Ocean coast, Humboldt Bay, and several rivers in addition to Redwood National and State Parks and Humboldt Redwoods State Park. The location of Eureka on U.S. 101 is north of San Francisco and northwest of Sacramento.

The city marina is on one of three islands at a narrow point on the bay and increases in elevation slightly as it spreads north, south, and especially to the east. The city gently encroaches at least two miles () eastward into primarily Redwood and Douglas-fir second growth forests. The city has a traditional grid that generally radiates toward the points of the compass. Most post-1970 houses were built in formerly clear cut forested areas.

The transition between the official city limits and smaller unincorporated areas is mostly not discernible. Eastern areas including secluded developments on a golf course among or in close proximity to extensive second-growth forest have more recently developed. These new houses were built as a result of the Eureka Community Plan of 1995 in attempt to bring locals close to centers of recreation and encourage community interaction. The city then gives way to hills and mountains of the rugged coast range, which quickly exceed in elevation.

Eureka is more or less on the same latitude as Atlantic cities New York City and Porto in Portugal along with the Mediterranean city of Naples in Italy, all of whom have much warmer summers in spite of also being on coastlines. By comparison, New York City&#x27;s climate is far more continental than Eureka&#x27;s, despite both cities being located around the 41st parallel and near the ocean.

=== Climate ===

Eureka has a mild, temperate cool-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csb&quot;). Due to the influence of the Pacific Ocean and being on the shoreline of the cold-water Humboldt Bay, its temperatures are cooler than those of a typical mediterranean climate. Winters are mild and rainy, and summers are mild, cool, and dry. The average high in December, the coolest month, is , while the average high temperature in August, the warmest month, is , which is very mild and cool, respectively, for an area at such a southerly latitude. Eureka&#x27;s average summer temperatures are much cooler than New York City and Istanbul which lie on the same latitude (and its average winter temperatures are also milder than those two cities); and are similar to those of Southeast Alaska, Scotland or Tierra del Fuego in southern Argentina and Chile, which lie well above the 50th parallel.

The seasonal temperature variation is very small; the difference between the August average of and the December average of is only , about equal to the diurnal temperature variation. Eureka is unique among mid-latitude climates in the northern hemisphere in that in more than 135 years of recorded temperatures, February has measured a warmer absolute maximum temperature than both the two high summer months of July and August. The absolute maximum temperature of July is merely in spite of the high sun strength. The two warmest nights measured in Eureka were both during winter, as January 18, 1981, recorded a low of , tying a February 26, 1980, record.

In addition, Eureka has a very short and milder range of temperatures compared to most of the contiguous US, with the all-time highest and lowest temperatures recorded in Eureka being only on October 26, 1993, September 2, 2017, and September 28, 2020, and on January 14, 1888, respectively. On average, the highest temperature seen throughout the entire year is only , one of the coolest in the contiguous US, while on average the lowest temperature seen in the year (most often occurring at night) is only a similarly moderate , yielding a very short and mild temperature range of about throughout the year. Additionally, Eureka remains the only city on the West Coast of the continental United States to have never recorded a temperature of .

Temperatures drop to freezing or below only on a few nights per year, and daytime temperatures for these days are typically mild temperatures ranging between . Eureka has never recorded an ice day, with the coldest daytime maximum being in 1990. Between 1991 and 2020, the coldest daytime high of the year was and the warmest night averaged . NOAA’s weather station averages indicate only of rainfall in July, which is well within the mediterranean range, only with rainier winters, cooler and milder air than a typical mediterranean climate. Winter temperatures instead are similar to many climates found in Southern Europe from which basin the climate type is named.

The area experiences coastal fog throughout the year, especially during summer on the coast when temperatures in the city remain consistently around a mild . This phenomenon, together with cool breezes from the Pacific Ocean, keeps Eureka relatively cool and mild, while contrasting with inland areas in relative proximity to Humboldt Bay, which are prone to extreme temperatures that often exceed . This causes frequent temperature differences between Eureka and nearby inland areas during summer and early fall of . Despite the common coastal fog, Eureka enjoys on average about 55% possible sunshine per year, about on par with cities such as Calgary, Portland, New York City and Chicago.

Annual precipitation averages . Measurable precipitation falls on an average of 127.5 days each year, concentrated heavily from October to April. On average, December is the wettest month, averaging over of precipitation, virtually all of it rain. The wettest &quot;rain year&quot; was from July 1889 to June 1890 with and the driest from July 1976 to June 1977 with . The greatest monthly precipitation was in December 2002. The greatest 24-hour precipitation was on December 27, 2002. However, historic 100-year dramatic weather events such as the Christmas Week flood of 1955 and, especially, the Christmas flood of 1964, which severely damaged the region, may not be reflected in records listed herein. Snowfall on the coast happens only on rare occasions, averaging as of the 1981–2010 normals, but only five years during that period received measurable snowfall. The most snowfall in one month was in January 1907.


== Demographics ==



The population of the city was 27,191 at the 2010 census, up from 26,128 at the 2000 census, representing a 4.1% increase, and the population of Greater Eureka was 45,034 at the 2010 Census, up from 43,452 at the 2000 census, representing a 3.6% increase.

According to a report by the City of Eureka, the Greater Eureka area minimally includes the unincorporated adjacent or nearby neighborhoods and Census Defined Populated Areas of Bayview, Cutten, Elk River, Freshwater, Humboldt Hill, Indianola, Myrtletown, Pine Hill, Ridgewood Heights, and Rosewood, all of which have Eureka addresses, postal zip codes and Eureka-specific telephone numbers. The Greater Eureka area makes up the largest urban settlement on the Pacific Coast between San Francisco and Portland. This area is similar to what the U.S. Census officially defines as the Eureka UC (urban cluster), which is a &quot;densely settled core of census tracts and/or census blocks that meet minimum population density requirements, along with adjacent territory containing non-residential urban land uses as well as territory with low population density included to link outlying densely settled territory with the densely settled core&quot; of up to 50,000 in population. The bayside communities of Manila, Samoa, and Fairhaven (all on the Samoa Peninsula), and King Salmon and Fields Landing (both located south of the city), and communities listed above, with the exception of Elk River and Freshwater, are shown to be part of the Eureka Urban Cluster. Eureka is the largest city of the Eureka-Arcata-Fortuna Micropolitan Area, a construct of the U.S. Census Bureau, which is synonymous with the County of Humboldt.

==Economy==

The economic base of the city was founded on timber and fishing and supplying resources for the gold mining efforts further inland. Gold mining diminished quickly in the early years, and activities of timber and fishing have also diminished, especially in the latter decades of the twentieth century. Today, the major industries are tourism, timber (in value), and healthcare and services (in number of jobs). As a part of the Emerald Triangle, Eureka is known for the sale of cannabis and as a center for cannabis tourism. Major employers today in Eureka include the following governmental entities: College of the Redwoods, The County of Humboldt, and the Humboldt County Office of Education. St. Joseph Hospital is the largest private employer in Eureka.

==Government==
===Local government===
The City of Eureka has a mayor-council system of governance. Primary power lies with the five council members, divided into five wards. The mayor has the power to appoint, as well as ceremonial duties, though the job includes presiding over council meetings and meeting visiting dignitaries. Official city business is administered by the Office of the City Manager. The Eureka City Council regularly meets on the 1st and 3rd Tuesdays of the month at 5:30 pm for closed session, and 6:30 pm for open session. Open sessions are open to the public.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
====Land====
 U.S. Route 101 is the major north and south highway, which connects Eureka to the rest of the North Coast region. The highway connects to Oregon, located approximately to the north, and San Francisco, over to the south. The highway follows city streets through the city, with flow and cross-traffic controlled by traffic signals. Highway 101 enters Eureka from the south as Broadway. As it reaches the downtown area, it splits into a one-way couplet composed of 4th Street and 5th Street. On the north side of the city, northbound and southbound rejoin at the northeast side before the highway becomes a restricted (safety corridor) expressway (to Arcata and points beyond) as double bridges cross the Eureka Slough (mouth of the Freshwater Creek).

 State Route 255 is an alternate route of U.S. 101 between Eureka and the nearby city of Arcata, running along the western shore of Humboldt Bay. It begins in the downtown area at U.S. 101 and proceeds north along R Street towards the Samoa Bridge and the community of Samoa.

 State Route 299 (formerly U.S. Route 299) connects to U.S. Route 101 at the northern end of Arcata. Route 299 begins at that point and extends easterly to serve as the major traffic artery to the east for Eureka.

====Air====
Eureka&#x27;s full-service airport is the Arcata-Eureka Airport, located north in McKinleyville. This airport has two airlines: United Airlines and Avelo Airlines. The airport connects to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Denver, and Burbank. Murray Field and Eureka Municipal Airport are general aviation airports for private and charter air service. Both are located adjacent to Humboldt Bay. Kneeland Airport, at in elevation, is a general aviation airport that provides an option for pilots choosing to land when the prevalent marine layer is affecting airports nearer sea level.

====Water====
The Humboldt Bay Harbor Recreation &amp; Conservation District manages the resources of Humboldt Bay and its environs, including the deep-water port. The port is located directly west of the city and is serviced across the bay in the community of Samoa. In addition to two deep-water channel docks for large ships, several modern small-craft marinas are available for private use, with a total capacity of more than 400 boats.

====Bus service====
Public bus transportation services within Eureka are provided by the Eureka Transit Service. The Redwood Transit System provides bus transportation through Eureka and connects to major towns and places outside the city, including educational institutions. Dial-A-Ride service is available through an application process.

The Amtrak Thruway 7 bus provides daily connections to/from Eurkea (with a curbside stop at 6th and C Streets) Martinez to the south, and Arcata to the north. Additional Amtrak connections are available from Martinez station.

Greyhound provides bus service to San Francisco from Eureka. Tickets may be purchased online or at the nearest full-service station in Arcata.

Transit in Eureka is expected to be improved by the $30 million Eureka Regional Transit and Housing Center, or EaRTH Center, which was greenlighted by the Eureka City Council in mid-February 2022. The development will contain an intermodal transit center, including car share facilities and regional bus connections, in addition to 31 affordable apartments. It is slated for completion in the fall of 2024.

===Utilities===

====Electricity and natural gas====
Eureka residents are served by Pacific Gas and Electric Company. Some reserves of natural gas are located south of the city. These and other fuels help power the Humboldt Bay Power Plant (which includes the defunct Humboldt Bay Nuclear Power Plant). In 2010, the cogeneration plant increased its capacity from 130 MW to 163 MW.

====Water====
The City of Eureka is the largest of the local water districts supplied by the Humboldt Bay Municipal Water District. The entire region is one of the few places in California that has historically enjoyed a significant surplus of water. The reduction in major forest products manufacturing in recent decades has left the area with a 45 MGD surplus of industrial water.

===Healthcare===
Eureka is the regional center for healthcare. The city is served by St. Joseph Hospital, which is the largest medical acute care hospital north of the San Francisco Bay Area on the California Coast. The hospital was first opened in 1920 and was operated by the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Orange until 2016. The facility is composed of two parts: a main campus contains the acute care facility and a nearby second site, the former General Hospital Campus, which contains a rehabilitation facility and a skilled nursing site.

In November 2012, the hospital completed required earthquake safety standards upgrades. The new primary wing contains surgical suites, intensive care, 24-hour emergency care, as well as new and enlarged patient rooms for those requiring care beyond short stay or outpatient procedures, assisted living facilities, skilled nursing facilities, surgery centers, and radiology (including MRI) facilities.

In June 2016, the California Attorney General&#x27;s office approved merging the St. Joseph Health system and the Providence Health and Services which includes St. Joseph&#x27;s in Eureka, making it part of the third-largest non-profit health system in the nation. The merger raises local and regional concerns about health care.

Eureka is also the site of the only comprehensive private and county-operated mental health emergency and hospitalization facilities north of San Francisco within California. Most of the doctors for the many medical specialties available on the far North Coast are located in or near Eureka, which also has the only oncology program and dialysis clinic in the region.

==Education==
Institutions of higher learning include the College of the Redwoods and California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt in Arcata. College of the Redwoods manages a downtown satellite campus as well.

Eureka City Schools, the largest school district in the region, administers the public schools of the city. Eureka High School receives all students from city grammar schools as well as all those from nearby unincorporated communities. Specific schools include: Alice Birney Elementary, Grant Elementary, Lafayette Elementary, Washington Elementary, Winship Middle School, Zane Middle School, Eureka High School, Humboldt Bay High School, Zoe Barnum High School, the Eureka Adult School, the Northern United Humboldt Charter School, and Winzler Children&#x27;s Center. The district offices are located in the remodeled Marshall School, which also contains the Marshall Family Resource Center, a site designed to offer programs in support of parents and families.

== Retail ==
The North Coast&#x27;s primary shopping facility, the Bayshore Mall, is the largest north of the San Francisco Bay Area on the California coast. The mall features over 70 stores and opened in 1987. Other major shopping areas and centers include Henderson Center, the Eureka Mall, Burre Center, and Downtown and Old Town Eureka. 

==Arts and culture==
Eureka is one of California&#x27;s historic landmarks. The California State Historical marker, #477, designating Eureka, is located in Old Town, one of the nation&#x27;s best-preserved original Victorian-era commercial districts. The city was voted as the No. 1 best small art town in John Villani&#x27;s book &quot;The 100 Best Small Art Towns in America&quot;. The downtown Eureka area is also decorated with many murals.

Eureka hosts the region&#x27;s largest monthly cultural and arts event, &quot;Arts&#x27; Alive!&quot; on the first Saturday of each month. More than 80 Eureka business and local galleries open their doors to the public. Often local cuisine and beverages accompany live performances by acclaimed regional bands and other types of performance art.

During the summer, Eureka hosts a large event series in Old Town called Friday Night Markets, which features local craftsmen, artists, food trucks, and musicians every Friday night.

Theater offerings include year-round productions from several various theater groups, including the North Coast Repertory Theater, the Redwood Curtain Theatre, and the Eureka Theater. Various events occur throughout the year at the Redwood Acres Fairgrounds.

=== Architecture ===

Because of northern isolation and unfavorable economic conditions in the latter part of the twentieth century, much of the post-war redevelopment and urban renewal that other cities experienced did not occur in Eureka. As a result, Eureka has hundreds of examples of 19th- and early-20th-century architecture and historic districts.

The original Queen Anne-style Murphy home in San Francisco was completely destroyed by the fire resulting from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Mark Carter found the blueprints for the home in an antique store and rebuilt the structure, but in Eureka; it is now the Carter House Inn.

Approximately 16% of the city&#x27;s structures are cataloged as important historical structures, with many of those attaining the status of state and national significance in terms of a particular structure&#x27;s importance in relationship to the body of surviving examples of the architectural style attributed to its construction and related detail. Thirteen distinct districts have been identified which meet the criteria for the National Register of Historic Places. Among them are the 2nd Street District (10 buildings), 15th Street district (13 buildings) and the O Street district (43 buildings). Hillsdale Street, a popular and well-preserved district, contains 17 buildings of historic interest. In all, some 1,500 buildings have been recognized as qualifying for the National Register. The Eureka Heritage Society, a local architectural preservation group founded in 1973, has been instrumental in protecting and preserving many of Eureka&#x27;s fine Victorians.

==Parks and recreation==
Sequoia Park Zoo includes Eureka&#x27;s largest public playground and a duck pond, in addition to gardens and examples of the area&#x27;s many varieties of rhododendron bushes. Sequoia Park Zoo is situated on more than of mature second-growth redwood forest and includes a Sky Walk that allows guests view the forest from high up walkway hung between the trees. The City of Eureka Recreation Department manages 13 playgrounds, including Cooper Gulch, which is , as well as tennis courts, basketball courts, and soccer fields. Other parks in or near Eureka include the Humboldt Botanical Garden and the Humboldt Bay National Wildlife Refuge, and the Eureka Marsh, an accessible protected marsh between the Bayshore Mall and Humboldt Bay. There is a modern boardwalk along the city&#x27;s waterfront. Located just north of Eureka&#x27;s Old Town, Halvorsen Park includes a walkway along the water. The Hikshari&#x27; Trail, also known as the Eureka Waterfront Trail, provides a paved walking and bike path along the Eureka&#x27;s coastline, and it is decorated with art installations.

==Media==
Though Eureka has been the base for two major daily newspapers at different times in its 150 years, only the &quot;Times-Standard&quot;, owned by the Colorado-based Media News Group, survives. The &quot;Times-Standard&quot; printed nearly 20,000 papers per day as of 2004; as of 2018, its distribution was 13,000 and it published online-only on Mondays. Media News Group also owns a weekly classified advertiser, the &quot;Tri-City Weekly&quot;, which promotes businesses and events in Eureka, Arcata, and Fortuna. &quot;The Eureka Reporter&quot;, founded in 2003, became a daily in 2006, began publishing five days per week at the end of 2007, and permanently closed in November 2008. The &quot;Lost Coast Outpost&quot; is another local web-based news source. The &quot;North Coast Journal&quot;, a regional weekly, moved from Arcata to Eureka in 2009. 

Eureka is also home to several alternative weekly publications. &quot;Senior News&quot; is a 24-page monthly newspaper distributed along a stretch of the Northwest California coast, published by the Humboldt Senior Resource Center since 1981. The small staff is augmented by community volunteer writers and by senior volunteers who distribute 5,000 free newspapers to more than 100 locations from Crescent City to Garberville.

Many of Humboldt County&#x27;s commercial radio stations are based in Eureka: KINS-FM (106.3), KWSW (980 AM), and KEKA-FM (101.5), owned and operated by Eureka Broadcasting Co. Inc. KFMI, KRED, KJNY and KATA. Lost Coast Communications owns and operates several stations broadcasting to Eureka: KSLG-FM, KHUM, KLGE, and KWPT. Eureka also hosts KMUE, the local repeater for Redway-based community radio station KMUD. On August 26, 2006, the Blue Ox Millworks launched KKDS-LP, a low power FM station focused on youth and community issues. On November 3, 2008, a low-power part 15 AM radio station named Old Glory Radio 1650 AM went on the air. It is based in the Myrtletown neighborhood of Eureka, and it offers the area&#x27;s only daily live local call-in program in the morning. KHSU, the region&#x27;s local public radio station, is broadcast from Cal Poly Humboldt in Arcata. A traveler&#x27;s information station owned by the State of California, KMKE-LP, operates at 98.1 MHz.

Eureka&#x27;s first television station was KIEM, which signed on the air on October 25, 1953. Additional stations signed on in the years following that first telecast, beginning in 1958, including KVIQ-LD and KAEF-TV.

==Sister city==
* Singkawang, West Kalimantan, Indonesia
* Kamisu, Japan: Kamisu Japan is the Official Sister City of Eureka California since 1991. At the time the partnership began, both cities had similar size populations and bays and were both off of a major Highway. Since 1991 both cities have participated in cultural exchanges. In 2019 Eureka named a park named after its sister city.

<doc id="107474" wikidata="Q3069604" url="?curid=107474" title="Ferndale, California">
<text>Ferndale is a city in Humboldt County, California, United States. Its population was 1,481 (2021 census), up from 1,371 at the 2010 census. The city contains dozens of well-preserved Victorian storefronts and homes. Ferndale is the northern gateway to California&#x27;s Lost Coast and the city, which is sited on the edge of a wide plain near the mouth of the Eel River, is also located near extensive preserves of coast redwood forests.

==History==
Before American settlement, Ferndale was a glade of giant ferns reaching more than , surrounded by alder, willow, Sitka spruce, Douglas fir, coast redwood, swampy land, and windswept prairies. The area was populated by the southern Wiyot people, and centered along the Eel River, where they caught lamprey eels, salmon and sturgeon in iris leaf fish nets and collected shellfish along the river and at its mouth, while cultivating a California species of tobacco.

The town was established in 1852 from settlement by Willard Allard, Seth Louis Shaw, and his brother, American portrait painter Stephen William Shaw. The settlement was incorporated in 1893.

=== Early settlers ===
 In August 1852, Allard and the Shaw brothers borrowed a canoe from the Wiyots in the Table Bluff area and paddled it across the Eel and up Francis Creek to arrive with their supplies in the approximate vicinity of what is now Main and Shaw streets. In September 1852, they cleared a five-acre area of ferns and began building a cabin near the base of the Wildcat Road even though Allard was sick with ague. By January 1853, twelve men were living in the Shaws&#x27; cabin including Seth Kinman, who provided the group with meat, and Joseph Russ. About this time, Stephen Shaw painted the portrait of Wiyot elder Kiwelattah (or Ki-we-lah-tah) and kept a detailed journal of two years of trying to grow plants in cold coastal fog.

Seth Shaw settled in the area now marked by Main and Lewis streets where he began construction of the Gothic Revival style Shaw House on his property in 1854. The Shaw House served as the area&#x27;s first polling place in 1854, post office and courthouse in 1863. in 1860 Seth Shaw was justice of the peace and postmaster, and his home served for many gatherings although it was not finished until 1866. After having been away from the area for two years, Stephen Shaw sold his holdings in 1856 to Welsh-born Francis Francis (1818–1877) who later established the city&#x27;s water system through pipes first laid in 1875.

Other small towns were established around Ferndale, including Centerville, Port Kenyon, Waddington, Grizzly Bluff, and Arlynda Corners. Produce from Ferndale was shipped out via Centerville and transferred to ships at anchor offshore prior to the opening of docks at Port Kenyon in 1876.

While the earliest settlers were English speaking from Great Britain, New England, Canada, or Ireland, waves of immigrants arrived in Ferndale from Denmark, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and China.

===European immigrants===
Danish settlers founded and built Our Savior&#x27;s Lutheran Church in 1899 and dedicated Danish Hall, which had been built as a warehouse by Arnold Berding in the late 1880s, on October 10, 1929. The Swiss who settled in Ferndale from Italian- and German-speaking families included the Oeschgers who moved to Ferndale in time for Joe Oeschger to play baseball at Ferndale High School before going to a career in Major League Baseball. A later influx of Romansh Swiss included the ancestors of College Football Hall of Fame coach Len Casanova. Sausage, salami-making and wine-making can be traced to Italians who arrived later than the Danish and Swiss, beginning around 1897. The Germans arrived earlier; the first was businessman Arnold Berding in 1857. Most Germans worked on ranches or were dairymen, but at least one owned the Milwaukee Brewery Depot Saloon. United States Congressman Don Clausen is descended from German settlers of Ferndale. German settlers organized St. Mark&#x27;s Lutheran Church in 1906. Except for three Portuguese brothers who arrived in the 1870s and a few from mainland Portugal, most came from the Azores islands between 1900 and 1915. Ferndale Portuguese have celebrated their traditional Festival of the Holy Ghost since 1924.

===Chinese settlement and expulsions===
Chinese immigrants arrived in California in the earliest gold-rush days, and were settled in all parts of Humboldt County almost as soon as English-speaking whites. They worked in gold mining on the Klamath and Trinity Rivers, before settling mostly in Eureka, with a few in outlying towns like Ferndale where two Chinese owned clothes washing businesses. Chinese laborers built parts of the Wildcat Road between Ferndale and Petrolia, dug out the water reservoirs for the Francis Water Company and worked at two fish canneries on the Eel River, although – as was the case in the rest of California – they were not truly welcome.

In 1885, after a city councilman of the county seat Eureka was shot dead in the crossfire from two warring Chinese tong gangs, 480 Chinese residents were rounded up in two days and forced to relocate to San Francisco. A year later, the Cutting Packing Company brought in a crew of Chinese for the season. Following a heated meeting at Roberts Hall in Ferndale between local residents and an upset delegation from Eureka, the company guaranteed the workers would come nowhere near town and they were allowed to stay until the fishing season was over in December. Chinese crews were used again at the same cannery in 1887 and 1889.

In 1906 Eureka and Fortuna citizens were again up in arms at Ferndale&#x27;s violation of the unwritten law of the county when the Starbuck–Talent Canning Company of Port Kenyon brought in 23 Chinese and four Japanese to work at the cannery. After threats of mass action, the Chinese were taken to an old cookhouse on Indian Island from which all whites were barred and where they were held until they left by sea. The Japanese were permitted to keep working for Starbuck–Talent.

===Business and communications===
Dairies were founded from the Bear River Ridge to the south side of the Eel River starting in the late 1860s. Filled kegs of butter were transported along the beach river by four-horse teams from the Mattole to Centerville or Port Kenyon and the teams returned supplies from Ferndale. The 81 dairies from the southern area faded as the land along the Eel River Valley was settled for dairying, first by the Danes and later by other settlers. In the 1880s, multiple cooperative creameries in the Eel River valley began to process milk into butter; by 1904, the Central Creamery on Main Street Ferndale had combined the smaller operations into a more modern production facility.

The use of paper wrapping on butter to reduce air oxidation was pioneered in Ferndale at the suggestion of Chester E. Gray (1881–1944) from the U.S. Department of Agriculture who studied the problem of unrefrigerated fine butter turning white within hours of production. Gray patented a new spray-drying process (U.S. Patent #858,868 – 1907 and #1,157,935 – 1915) and went into business with Central Creamery owner Aage Jensen in a new dry-milk manufacturing process that used non-fat milk solids which had formerly been waste of the process. Their new plant processed 75,000 pounds of milk a day, shipping to San Francisco and filling contracts for the U.S. Navy. The first motorized milk truck was used here.

In 1916, Grey and Jensen moved to San Francisco and changed the company name to Golden State Creamery Local Ferndale resident and Eureka newspaper editor Andrew Genzoli began recording the history of the Ferndale dairies during this time, culminating in scrapbooks of newspaper clippings from 1910 to 1954.

Ferndale was a crossroads village and provided lodging, horses, blacksmithing and other services both to individual travelers and the Overland Stage and Express line which ran from Eureka to Cloverdale with connections to San Francisco; over 80 hours of traveling for a cost of $20. The first stage line was founded in 1862 with daily trips from Eureka, Centerville, and Petrolia. In 1868, twice weekly stages ran to San Francisco and by 1871 daily service was available. The first automobiles were used for the stage runs in 1911, the same year as Fernbridge (bridge) was built, eliminating the need for ferry boat service.

In 1878, regular service on steamships carried produce, cargo and passengers from Port Kenyon, where, by 1897, 188,652 pounds of wool and 965,010 pounds of butter were shipped out along with grains, chickens, potatoes, lumber, eggs, hides, vegetables, and salmon. The steamer trade declined as the Salt River silted up and the transport hub shifted to Eureka The completion of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad in 1914 allowed for speedier transportation to Eureka and the San Francisco area. The track was built about five miles to the northwest of Ferndale in Fernbridge.

Main Street businesses supplied the needs of not only the Ferndale area, but for the inland Mattole Valley as well. They included banks, hotels, stables, variety and merchandise stores, hardware and grocery stores, farm and machine implements, butchers, blacksmiths shoemakers, barbers, tailors, milliners, saloons and gambling halls, billiard parlors, coopers, doctors, dentists, drug stores, lawyers, engineers, surveyors, real estate agents, several photographers, furniture makers, undertakers, a telegraph office, and a Wells–Fargo office.

Telephone and telegraph wires were run into the valley by private companies in the 1890s; by 1899, it was said that the telephone was in &quot;almost universal use in this valley.&quot; In 1900, the telephone line was extended to the Mattole Oil fields in Petrolia. In 1911, the Eel River and Southern Telephone company consolidated operations around Ferndale, and, on February 6, 1960, dial telephones were introduced; the old switchboard and crank phones are on display at the Ferndale Museum.

The &quot;Ferndale Enterprise&quot; newspaper was founded on May 11, 1878, by three sons of the local Methodist minister and has published continuously since then, while moving offices and shifting from semi-weekly to weekly publication.

===Incorporation and services===
Ferndale incorporated with a vote of 89 in favor and 47 against on August 17, 1893, primarily to organize drainage and prevent dogs and other animals from running loose, according to the earliest ordinances enacted. In 1915, the current firehouse was built as combined firehouse and city hall. 

After the 1875 fire which nearly destroyed south Main street was put out by volunteer bucket brigades, and after other smaller conflagrations, the City purchased a used Hunneman hand pumper fire engine on April 14, 1883. The side-stroke torrent pumper had been built in the 1850s and been shipped west in the 1860s. The name on the side of this engine was &quot;Franklin&quot; because the city bought it from the Franklin Fire Company of San Jose, California. The engine was transferred to the newly formed Ferndale Fire Department when they organized in February 1897. In November 1923, after 41 years in service, the hand pumper was shipped to the American LaFrance Company, &quot;as part payment on the fine new pumper recently purchased by this town.&quot; Other sources say the engine was sold to a Hollywood film company.

Modern equipment arrived in 1905 with a motorized pumper engine, in 1917 with a Model T truck with chemical tanks and in 1948 the Hook and Ladder Company formed. In 1883, water supplies were consolidated in local cisterns under present-day State Route 211 which were later filled in and water from the hill reservoirs was used to supply the hydrants.

In 1902, the fire alarm was placed in a wooden structure at the corner of Brown and Main which fell over in the 1906 earthquake which led to the bell being hung at the firehouse, and a steam-whistle at the Creamery used for the fire alarm from 1906 until electric sirens came into use in 1931

Electrical lighting was installed in May 1896, supplied by a wood-burning steam electric-generating plant that worked between dusk and midnight only; it was replaced in 1903 by a distillate-burning steam electric generator a few blocks east of Main Street. In 1911, the earlier generation and distribution systems were merged into Western States Gas and Electric acquired in 1927 by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company.

The national landmark Ferndale Public Library was completed in 1910 with local funds and an $8,000 Carnegie grant. In 1876, the Ferndale Cemetery Association was established, which manages the burial ground. There is also a Catholic cemetery on Bluff Street.

The Ferndale Museum has educational exhibits of area history, paper records, photographs and also genealogical resources.

==Geography==
Ferndale is located at . Its location south of US 101, is very close to the mouth of the Eel River as it enters the Pacific Ocean. By car, Ferndale is north of San Francisco and south of Eureka. California State Route 211 is the major road connecting the city with US 101. Directly to the south of Ferndale is the Lost Coast region, whose geology and terrain has made it difficult to establish routes through the area. It has thus made that area only accessible by land via small county mountain roads, such as Mattole Road, running from Ferndale south to Petrolia.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Ferndale has a total area of , all of it land.

===Earthquakes===
Ferndale&#x27;s location near the Mendocino triple junction, a subduction fault associated with the offshore interaction of the Pacific, North American, and Gorda tectonic plates, makes it extremely susceptible to earthquakes. Earthquakes affected Ferndale in the 19th century, but the first to receive widespread news coverage was the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which damaged more than 40 structures in the downtown, with severe damages to the two brick buildings, and 98 percent of chimneys thrown down. The earthquake was estimated at a Mercalli intensity of VII (&quot;Very strong&quot;) at Ferndale.

On January 22, 1923, a 7.2 magnitude earthquake centered off Cape Mendocino was said to be nearly as great a shock in Ferndale as the 1906 earthquake and produced a tsunami. Chimneys fell, water mains and plate glass windows broke, and the recently repaired Odd Fellows building fell off its new foundation. The earthquake arrived with a ground rumble and a flash of light.

On August 20, 1927, an earthquake centered about west of Arcata caused considerable damage around Humboldt Bay, and damage reports from Ferndale included broken chimneys, merchandise tossed from shelves and china and glassware broken.

Smaller earthquakes were recorded from the 1920s through the 1980s, but the next big earthquake to strike Ferndale was actually three earthquakes collectively named the 1992 Cape Mendocino earthquakes. The first of these struck on April 25 during the first &quot;Best of the West&quot; festival parade, shattering the glass windows of the stores on Main Street. The brick facade of Valley Grocery collapsed, and police estimated damage to 80 percent of the downtown buildings. Between 30 and 40 houses were knocked off their foundations from the first shock, which was centered about south of Eureka and had a magnitude of 7.1. The other two large earthquakes hit within 18 hours of the first and were of magnitude 6.5 and 6.7. Both a large landslide and several small landslides occurred on the Mattole Road, which also cracked due to downhill slumping and soil compaction of the road shoulders. Damages in Ferndale were estimated at $10.4 million.

On January 9, 2010, the 6.5 magnitude 2010 Eureka earthquake&#x27;s epicenter was about offshore from Ferndale. It was the largest local earthquake since the 1992 Cape Mendocino earthquakes.

On December 20, 2022, the 2022 Ferndale earthquake with a magnitude of 6.4 centered approximately from Ferndale impacted the city and temporarily closed Fernbridge.

Almost 2 years after that earthquake, on December 5th, 2024, the 2024 Cape Mendocino earthquake struck the city. With a magnitude of 7.0, and having an epicenter of only 62 miles (100 km) southwest of Ferndale, the earthquake was felt in the city and the rest of Humboldt County. It also sparked a tsunami warning, but due to the nature of the earthquake, no tsunami materialized.

==Climate==
Ferndale&#x27;s climate is moderated by its proximity to the Pacific Ocean and in the lee of the Wildcat Hills. Winter temperatures rarely go below freezing and summer days are rarely over . Ferndale has a warm summer Mediterranean climate indicated by the code &quot;Csb&quot; on some weather maps. Ferndale receives most of its roughly of rain from November to May, with lesser amounts in the summer months. Local microclimates are varied and support tropical palm trees and Sitka spruce, including a mature Sitka forest in Russ Park, and the over spruce lighted every year for Christmas. Morning fogs are common year round.

A weather station was run in the town from 1963 to 1973. The climate is similar to that of nearby Eureka.

==Arts and culture==

===Tourism===
Ferndale, sometimes also referred to as &quot;Cream City&quot;, is known for well-preserve Victorian storefronts on Main Street and homes throughout the community, which are also known as &quot;Butterfat Palaces,&quot; due to their construction wherein considerable wealth was generated in the dairy industry. Many of these buildings date from the 1880s. The entire town is registered as California Historical Landmark #883.

Six historic buildings as well as the Ferndale Main Street Historic District and the Fern Cottage Historic District are within or around Ferndale and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Other points of interest include the Ferndale City Hall, Ferndale Museum, Ferndale Cemetery, St. Mary&#x27;s Cemetery, Our Savior&#x27;s Lutheran Church, Saint Mark&#x27;s Lutheran Church, Church of the Assumption, the Congregational Church (now the Community Church), and the Humboldt County Fairgrounds.

===Annual events===

The Humboldt County Fair has been held every August since 1896 at the county fairgrounds on the edge of Ferndale, and feature the only horse-racing events in the county along with agricultural, pastoral and artistic contests, carnival games, carnival amusement rides, and commercial and nonprofit booths.

Every year since 1934 in early December, local volunteer firefighters climb and light one of America&#x27;s tallest living Christmas trees, an approximately spruce, during a celebration of song held at Fireman&#x27;s Park.

The Ferndale Lighted Tractor Parade has been held every mid-December since 1993.

The Fray In Ferndale, a slot car race with the highest attendance of this type of event anywhere in the world has been held since 1997. More than 100 racers on sixteen teams arrive to compete on eight custom-built tables.

The Foggy Bottom Milk Run has been held (excluding two years for COVID) each March since 1977. Races were held in , , and distances. Beginning in 2024, only the will be run.

The Kinetic sculpture race has finished each May since 1969 in front of 393 Main Street. The race began in Ferndale when Hobart Brown was challenged to race his odd-looking five-wheeled bike down Main Street on Mother&#x27;s Day that year by local sculptor Jack Mays. Multiple races were held in the first few years, but standardized on the current course in the late 1970s.

==Parks and recreation==
===City Hall Park===
City Hall Park was deeded to the city by the Village Club in 1918. The triangular park was filled with material graded from the southern end of Main Street, and a Clubhouse (now City Hall) was finished in 1931. The building was styled to look like an English cottage. The fireplace was sent from England as a gift from the daughter of a resident. Its granite comes from a Welsh quarry and was chiseled in San Francisco. The Gazebo, which contains Ferndale&#x27;s California Historical Landmark Plaque, is at the north end of City Hall Park. In 2011 new benches and trees were added to the park.

===Firemen&#x27;s Park===
Firemen&#x27;s Park at the southernmost end of town between Francis and Berding Streets is bordered on three sides by houses and to the south by restricted watershed property. It has ball fields, a playground, picnic area and three bocce courts. The Community Center in Fireman&#x27;s Park was built in 1922. It includes a large dance and meeting pavilion with attached kitchen. The Ferndale Children&#x27;s Center has occupied part of the pavilion since 1991.

===Hadley Gardens===
Located at 655 Main Street, next to the Shaw House, the creekside gardens include a replica dollhouse, native flora, a waterfall, and a &quot;hobbit house&quot;.

===Russ Park===
Russ Park, located three blocks east of Main Street on Bluff Street, is open sunrise to sunset. Several hiking trails cross the mature forest in the park donated to the city by Zipporah Patrick Russ on October 31, 1920. The deed includes &quot;That the property be used forever as a park and recreation grounds … as a refuge and breeding place for birds.&quot; Dominant trees include Sitka spruce and Douglas fir with a few redwoods, blue gum eucalyptus, and other tree species. More than 100 kinds of birds are known from the park, which is the southern extent of the Pacific Northwest temperate rainforest.

==Government==

===Local===
Ferndale was incorporated in 1893 and is governed by a four-member City Council and a Mayor, all of whom serve four-year terms chosen in the general election of even-numbered years.

In 2004 the City Council placed Measure O on the municipal ballot to eliminate the elective office of Mayor, instead proposing to appoint the position by a vote of the City Council from the council members. The measure was defeated with 78.8% voting against. When the Mayor&#x27;s seat was next open for election in 2006, all of the mayoral candidates were write-ins.

===State and federal===
In the state legislature, Ferndale is in , and .

Federally, Ferndale is in .

==Education==

The Ferndale Unified School District has two schools, the Ferndale Elementary School with grades K–8 and the Ferndale High School.

The elementary school is older; it dates back to the 1860s with school rooms and houses in various locations. In 1890, school trustees started a new building, but it—and the old building—were completely destroyed in an arson fire before it was finished. A replacement three-story, redwood Greek Revival building was built after the September fire and in time to open in February 1891. The stucco one-story building which currently houses the Ferndale Elementary School was built in 1924. The baby-boom of the 1960s resulted in classes at the Fairgrounds as well as the addition of four modular classrooms (since removed), and the construction of a gymnasium in 1967. The following year, the closure of the Assumption Catholic School (1915–1968) rapidly increased enrollment as 117 students transferred and the rising enrollment resulted in the addition of five primary classrooms and a playground. In 1976 the building was earthquake retrofitted.

The high school was founded in 1904 by the unification of smaller school districts across the Eel River Valley, including Port Kenyon, Island School, Grant School, Salt River School, Coffee Creek School, Grizzly Bluff School and Pleasant Point School. The original building was in use from 1907 to 1951 when it was replaced by the present high school facility. Enrollment in 2004–2005 was 175 students in grades 9 to 12.

Ferndale has an active sports program with junior varsity and varsity softball, volleyball, basketball, soccer and football. Ferndale won its 14th California football sectional title and the California Interscholastic Federation Division 7-AA football championship in 2023. The girls&#x27; soccer team won the California North Coast Section championship in 2023.

The school has a long-time sports rivalry with neighboring Fortuna Union High School. The first Ferndale Wildcat versus Fortuna Huskies &quot;Milk Can&quot; football game was played in 1945 and each year since with approximately 20 years hiatus. Fortuna had won more games than Ferndale, as of 2013, the record was 27–20–1. In 2011, the Milk Can was stolen from Ferndale High School during a break-in by three Fortuna High School students, thrown over a bluff, and later recovered by police.

==Media==
Ferndale is home to the oldest newspaper under a single name in Humboldt County, the &quot;Ferndale Enterprise&quot;. Commercial radio station KHUM operates in a joint studio with KLGE, KSLG-FM and KWPT. Ferndale is also home to the North Coast&#x27;s oldest theatre company, The Ferndale Repertory Theatre which has been in operation since 1972.

==Infrastructure==
===Affordable housing===

U.S. Navy Housing was built for staff of the 37-acre Naval Facility (NAVFAC) Centerville Beach, Centerville, California which was commissioned on March 25, 1958. Originally the base was staffed by 95 people, but grew to over 280 people. The 52-unit Ferndale Navy Housing was built as part of this project. The NAVFAC was decommissioned on September 30, 1993.

The U.S. Coast Guard subsequently occupied the Navy Housing but vacated the housing units in October 2008. The property was returned to the Navy which declared the units surplus. In order to acquire the housing, a ballot initiative was required. The city placed Measure S on the ballot for the November 2, 2010, election. Measure S passed 516 (74.57%) to 176 (25.43%) approving the city&#x27;s plan to acquire low- and moderate-income housing from the Navy.

The Ferndale City Council voted to purchase the housing from the Navy for $1.00 on September 1, 2011. The city began negotiations with the nonprofit O&#x27;Rourke Foundation, part of the Bertha Russ Lytel Foundation, to take over and run the 52-unit project as an affordable housing project. The Navy housing is ten percent of the available housing in the city. The 24 single-family homes, 14 duplex townhouses, three playgrounds and two community buildings of the former Navy Housing were transferred from the Navy to the city in a public ceremony with Congressman Mike Thompson on October 23, 2011.

===Drinking water===
The Ferndale water system was installed by Mr. Francis Francis in 1872. In 1906, the Francis Land and Water Company was incorporated and in 1910 they bought the Cold Springs Water Company which supplied eastern Ferndale. In 1954, the Citizens Utilities Company bought the system from the Francis Estate and sold it to Del Oro Water Company in 1996.

Ferndale&#x27;s spring water comes from 28 individual springs which produce per minute. Historic tunnels under a hillside and a million gallon underwater reservoir collect and store water before distribution. As a secondary source of supply, water may also come from the Van Ness Treatment Plant which can supply an average of nearly 30 gallons per minute. The Del Oro Water Company finished the Ferndale Mainline Replacement Project in 2011 which included larger pipes and new valves to reduce the number of customers affected during line repairs.

===Wastewater treatment===
Ferndale&#x27;s first sewage treatment facility and combined sewer system was built in 1953 and upgraded in 1973, 1994 and 2001. Improvements were made to the sewers in 1989 under a $400,000 project funded by the California State Water Resources Control Board to improve the collection system and reduce inflow and infiltration.

El Niño storms in April 1998 caused Williams Creek to change course due to debris blockage. Williams Creek had been the major tributary of the Salt River near the treatment plant, so diversion lowered the volume of water available and caused the dilution ratios at the plant to exceed permitted levels. Record storm water flows also damaged the plant and the city applied for financial assistance under the FEMA-1203-DR-CA El Niño storm Presidential disaster declaration. On May 15, 2003, the Regional Water Board (RWB) placed a Cease and Desist order on Ferndale due to discharges of treated wastewater which exceeded one percent of the flow of Francis Creek / Salt River stream system. The city paid a $48,000 penalty to the RWB and agreed to complete an environmental project instead of paying $78,000 more in penalties to the RWB and began replacing the old plant in 2009.

The new wastewater plant was completed in 2011 and provides tertiary treatment for nearly 1,500 commercial and residential users. The only other wastewater facility like Ferndale&#x27;s in California is in Colfax.

===Filming location===
Ferndale has been featured in such movies as &quot;The Majestic&quot; and &quot;Outbreak&quot;. It has appeared in such made-for-television movies as &quot;Salem’s Lot&quot;, &quot;A Death in Canaan&quot;, and &quot;Joe Dirt.&quot; It was also the location of the iconic “I&#x27;m a Pepper” commercial for Dr. Pepper.

Ferndale was also featured by Huell Howser in &quot;Road Trip&quot; Episode 149, the science fiction horror cult film She Demons (1958), the award-winning short film Nonnie &amp; Alex (1995), and the comedy-drama Kingdom Come (2001).

===Legoland model replica===
Many of Ferndale&#x27;s buildings have been recreated at the Legoland California theme park, as the only American small town to be represented alongside New York, San Francisco, Las Vegas and other nationally known locations. Ferndale was settled by many Danes, and Lego is a Danish company. In 1995, Legoland staff took hundreds of photos in Ferndale, and used over one million Lego bricks to recreate the town in the Miniland section of the park.

<text>Fortuna (Spanish for &quot;Fortune&quot;; Wiyot: &quot;Vutsuwitk Da&#x27;l&quot;) is a city on the northeast shore of the Eel River, approximately from where it enters the Pacific Ocean, and is on U.S. Route 101 in west-central Humboldt County, California, United States. The population was 12,516 at the 2020 census, up from 11,926 at the 2000 census.

==History==

The settlement was originally called &quot;Slide,&quot; for Slide Hill, in 1874, named for the slide that was a fixture on the northeast side of the Eel River and the southwest portion of Christian Ridge just to the northwest, near the edge of town. In 1875, the name was changed to Springville during the construction of the Springville Mill, a lumber mill for the nearby redwood forests, named so because of the numerous springs in the area. The mill&#x27;s owners were Henry Rohner (namesake of neighboring Rohnerville), Alexander Masson, M. N. Weber and G. F. Gushaw. Springville was originally a company town belonging to the mill, and the few people that resided there all worked at the mill. By the late 1870s Springville had grown enough to warrant a post office, but a town called Springville, California (now part of Camarillo, in Ventura County) already existed in the state. The post office was named Slide on May 24, 1876. In 1884 the residents petitioned the state legislature for the name Fortuna, Spanish for &quot;fortune&quot; and Latin for &quot;chance,&quot; and by July 3, 1888, the change was official. The name was chosen when settlers saw the proximity of the forests, the river and its valley, and the Pacific Ocean, as ideal for enjoying a good quality of life, and felt &quot;fortunate&quot; to live there. It is believed that a local minister and real estate agent, desiring to sell lots to newcomers, devised the name as a marketing tool. Alternatively, an Odd Fellows men&#x27;s club was known as the Fortuna Lodge, No. 221. Jack Hosier, a member, suggested the name of Fortuna for the town.

Electricity came to Fortuna in 1883 when W. J. Swortzel and George W. Williams (of Swortzel &amp; Williams), owners of the Springville Mill Company, built a $4,000 power plant. Some of the local sawmills were already powered by electricity, and by providing power to the mills, Swortzel and Williams saw the opportunity to also provide inexpensive electric lighting to the townspeople.

The town was incorporated on February 20, 1906, and, because of the Eel River, became known for its agricultural prowess in vegetable crops, berries and fruits, and for the fresh fish from the river. Although agricultural industry was expanding, the lumber industry is what started the town, and would continue as the main source of local income for some time to come.

Rohnerville (formerly Eel River Township), a town founded to service the many gold miners inhabiting the mountains to the north and east, was competing with Fortuna to be the leading township in the area. The miners would come by ship to Eureka, and then head up the Eel River to the junction with the Van Duzen River, from whence the miners headed east up the Van Duzen River Valley into Trinity County. Rohnerville was at this junction, and looked to prosper from selling supplies to the miners. But when it was decided that the railroad would be routed through neighboring Fortuna, it set the fate of both towns.

The Eel River and Eureka Railroad was built in 1884 to provide Humboldt Bay shipping access to the lumber mills and farms of the lower Eel River. Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway reorganized Fortuna&#x27;s railroad as the San Francisco and Northwestern Railway in 1903, and then completed the Northwestern Pacific Railroad to San Francisco in 1914. Fortuna became the rail hub for smaller communities like Alton, Fernbridge, Ferndale, Hydesville, Newburg, Port Kenyon, Rohnerville, and Waddington. Fortuna was the location of one of two secondary mills of the storied Pacific Lumber Company, headquartered south in Scotia.

Since Fortuna&#x27;s earliest days in the 1800s, its nickname has been &quot;The Friendly City.&quot;

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

Fortuna is located from the Pacific coast on the bank of the Eel River. The community is affected by coastal weather patterns with the Pacific Ocean to the west. Fortuna is served by U.S. Route 101 providing direct access to San Francisco to the south, and to Eureka (the county seat) to the north. The western terminus of California State Route 36 intersects U.S. Route 101 just south of the city limits. Fortuna is surrounded by national, state and county redwood parks, and is the gateway to the redwood forests of Northern California. &quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot; grow to about and live to be 2,500 years old. The Avenue of the Giants offers views of the area&#x27;s redwoods, and carries visitors through a number of groves. Stops include Founders Grove, the Visitor Center near Weott and several locations that provide trail access.

<doc id="107482" wikidata="Q2544177" url="?curid=107482" title="Rio Dell, California">
<text>Rio Dell (Spanish: &quot;Río Dell&quot;, meaning &quot;river,&quot; with English &quot;dell,&quot; meaning small valley in a woodland) is a city in Humboldt County, California, United States. It is located on the west bank of the Eel River north of Scotia at an elevation of 161 feet (49 m). The population was 3,363 at the 2010 census, up from 3,174 at the 2000 census.

==History==
Rio Dell was founded and named by businessman Lorenzo Painter, who devised the name as a merging of Spanish &quot;río&quot; (&quot;river&quot;) and English &quot;dell&quot; (&quot;small wooded valley&quot;).

Originally settled on the territories of the Wiyot, Nongatl, and Mattole tribes, Rio Dell was reportedly first dubbed &quot;Tokemuk&quot; by native inhabitants of the land who were thought to be of multiple regional tribes and who uniquely spoke at least two different regional languages. The native presence was greatly diminished following the 1860 Wiyot massacre on Indian Island that extended south to the Eel river valley where Rio Dell is located. From there, the area became known as Eagle Prairie and finally as Rio Dell.

The first post office at Rio Dell opened in 1876. Rio Dell was connected to Scotia by a ferry provided by the lumber mill in Scotia. After the first bridge was destroyed by a flood in 1905, a ferry carried mill workers from Rio Dell upstream to Scotia, and a second ferry carried mill workers downstream to Metropolitan until a suspension bridge was built to Scotia in 1914. Many Italian immigrants lived in what came to be known as Wildwood, south of Rio Dell proper, and known at the time to outsiders as &quot;Little Italy&quot;. This part of town became popular with mill workers seeking moonshine, gambling, and prostitution unavailable in the company town of Scotia where they were employed. Men came from as far away as Eureka to enjoy these illegal entertainments, or to engage in recreational fighting, the downtown very soon becoming known as &quot;Wildwood&quot;. Rio Dell&#x27;s main street still carries the name &quot;Wildwood Avenue&quot;. In 1928 buildings on both sides of this street were engulfed by a fire started by a moonshine still. The fire endangered the bridge to Scotia and prevented the Scotia Fire Department from crossing the bridge to help extinguish the fire.

Rio Dell became home to the workforce for one of the largest lumber mills in the world, the Pacific Lumber Company. It was often the first home of immigrants to the United States and Humboldt County, particularly for the young Italian and Portuguese immigrant workforce of the early 20th century. Rio Dell was incorporated in 1965 as a result of changing demographics, a post-war population expansion and the reluctance of the local Sheriff to provide law enforcement services to what was perceived as a dangerous and remote community. The primary benefit of municipal incorporation being a city&#x27;s ability to create its own armed police department under local control. The department totaled 14 sworn officers shortly after obtaining city status. Following the city&#x27;s incorporation in 1965 a series of events over the next two decades led to the economic decline of the community, including the opening of a new freeway bypass and the eventual demise of Pacific Lumber Company (Palco) as a significant employer.

Rio Dell was impacted by the 2022 Ferndale earthquake.

<text>Trinidad (Spanish for &quot;Trinity&quot;; Yurok: &quot;Chuerey&quot;) is a seaside city in Humboldt County, located on the Pacific Ocean north of the Arcata-Eureka Airport and north of the college town of Arcata. Trinidad is noted for its coastline, with ten public beaches and offshore rocks, part of the California Coastal National Monument, of which Trinidad is a &quot;Gateway City.&quot; Fishing operations related to Trinidad Harbor are vital to both local tourism and commercial fishing interests in the region. Situated at an elevation of above its own North Coast harbor, Trinidad is one of California&#x27;s smallest incorporated cities by population, with 367 residents in 2010, up from 311 residents in 2000.

==History==

The Yurok people established the village of Tsurai on bluffs overlooking Trinidad Bay in prehistoric times. They occupied the village for thousands of years before vacating it in 1916.

The first European sighting of Trinidad Harbor was in 1595 by the Manila galleon captain Sebastian Rodriguez Cermeño, who did not make landfall. The next European visit was by Bruno de Heceta and Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra
of the Spanish Navy. Their two ships anchored in Trinidad Bay on June 9, 1775. On June 11, 1775, which was Trinity Sunday, Heceta and his men conducted a formal act of possession, claiming the bay for King Charles III of Spain. At the place where they erected a wooden Christian cross, a carved granite cross bearing the inscription &quot;Carolus III Dei G. Hyspaniorum Rex&quot; (&quot;In the name of King Charles of Spain&quot;) was installed in 1913.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obama 2017/01/12&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Spaniards named the area &quot;La Santisima Trinidad&quot; (&quot;The Most Holy Trinity&quot;). Heceta and Bodega were the first Europeans to locate and describe the village of Tsurai.

The area was under the control of the Kingdom of Spain until Mexico&#x27;s independence in 1821, when it became part of Mexico. The Russian-American Company started using Trinidad Bay as a base for sea otter hunting around 1806. They considered a permanent outpost there but instead established Fort Ross near Bodega Bay in 1812. The United States conquered California during the Mexican-American War in 1846, and California became a U.S. state in 1850. American settlers arrived in Trinidad Bay on the ship &quot;James R. Whitting&quot; in 1850 and founded the town, renamed Warnersville in honor of R. V. Warner, one of the settlers. The first post office opened in Trinidad in 1851.

Trinidad was the original county seat of the eponymous Trinity County from 1850 to 1851, and of Klamath County, one of California&#x27;s original counties, from 1851 to 1854. In 1854 Trinidad became part of the newly created Humboldt County after its creation in 1853 with its county seat in Eureka. Klamath County was finally dissolved in 1874.

During the American Civil War (1861–1865), California volunteers fighting the local Native Americans in the Bald Hills War were stationed at Camp Trinidad in Trinidad beginning in July 1863 to protect both the town and the coast road from Native American raids. In October 1863 they were moved north to Camp Gilmore.

Trinidad was incorporated on November 7, 1870, as a city of the State of California.

On December 31, 1914, the largest recorded ocean wave ever to hit the United States West Coast struck Trinidad Head, a rocky promontory surrounded by sea stacks sheltering Trinidad Harbor. At 4:40 p.m. local time, United States Lighthouse Service lighthouse keeper Captain Fred L. Harrington at Trinidad Head Light observed a huge wave offshore approaching the bluff on which the lighthouse stood. He reported that the wave, which appeared to him to reach the height of the lighthouse&#x27;s lantern above sea level, washed completely over Pilot Rock offshore, then broke over the top of the bluff, submerging the area between the lighthouse and the bluff, with water reaching the lighthouse&#x27;s balcony. His report that the wave crested at a height equal to that of the lantern and that water reached the balcony suggests a possible wave height of . The wave&#x27;s impact shook the lighthouse and extinguished its light, although Harrington restored service in four hours.

A California Sea Products Company whaling station operated in Trinidad from 1920 to 1926. During its operations, 1,140 whales were killed and processed.

Trinidad resident Henry A. Boyes was a United States Marine Corps first sergeant with the 5th Marine Regiment during World War II (1941–1945). His service was described by Eugene Sledge in the 1981 book &quot;With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa&quot;.

A portion of Trinidad Head totaling was transferred to the City of Trinidad in 1983 with the condition that the property be maintained for public recreation. The southern of the promontory, including Trinidad Head Light, remained under United States Coast Guard ownership until 2014, when the Coast Guard transferred it to the United States Department of the Interior&#x27;s Bureau of Land Management. The city rezoned its portion of the promontory as &quot;open space,&quot; and in 1984 it opened a trail running around Trinidad Head. 

In January 2017, the United States Congress added the Bureau of Land Management&#x27;s portion of Trinidad Head to the onshore area of the California Coastal National Monument. President Barack Obama used his executive power under the 1906 Antiquities Act to designate the Bureau of Land Management&#x27;s portion of Trinidad Head as a unit of the National Monument.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Trinidad has an oceanic climate, bordering on a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (csb), and is relatively temperate compared with inland areas. Annual temperatures range from approximately . Winter months are rainy with the average amount being around , Although rain falls in all months of the year, it is less pronounced in the summertime. Spring and fall cold fronts often form advection fog which pushes the marine layer towards the coast. In summer, low-pressure troughs produced by intense heating inland can create strong pressure gradients pulling the marine layer ashore. Summer fogs, moderate precipitation and mild temperatures are characteristic of Northern California coastal forests ecoregion and are vital to the growth of local Coast Redwood. Protected stands of old growth redwoods can be visited north of Trinidad, in Redwood National and State Parks.

Edward Bernhardt Schnaubelt was the brother of Rudolph Schnaubelt, accused of the Haymarket Riot bombing in Chicago, Illinois and the brother-in-law of Michael Schwab, sentenced to death for his role in the riot. All three Schnaubelt brothers left Chicago shortly after the riot. Edward Schnaubelt briefly panned for gold before settling in Trinidad, opening a sawmill and buying a tract of timber to supply his mill. After Schnaubelt&#x27;s mill was taken over by his rivals, he re-entered the closed mill at night to reclaim his personal tools and was shot to death by a nightwatchman hired to protect the property. His wife chose the phrase &quot;Murdered by Capitalism&quot; for his marker which inspired the 2004 book by John Ross.

<text>Bombay Beach is a census-designated place (CDP) in Imperial County, California, United States. It is located on the Salton Sea, west-southwest of Frink and is the lowest community in the United States, located below sea level. The population was 231 at the 2020 census, down from 295 in 2010, down from 366 in 2000. It is part of the El Centro, California, metropolitan statistical area.

Bombay Beach was once a popular getaway for beachgoers until the 1980s, when the draining and increasing salinity of the Salton Sea destroyed the lake&#x27;s ecosystem and drove businesses and private landowners out of the area, rendering Bombay Beach a ghost town. Despite this, by 2018, a number of people had moved into the area, and the town&#x27;s many abandoned structures and features from its past have drawn visitors back in. A 2018 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that it was &quot;enjoying a rebirth of sorts with an influx of artists, intellectuals and hipsters who have turned it into a bohemian playground.&quot; The Bombay Beach Biennale, an annual art festival, is held here.

==History==
During the 1950s, Bombay Beach was a popular beach-going destination. Celebrities such as Frank Sinatra, the Beach Boys, and Bing Crosby frequented the luxury resorts along the Salton Sea, which was known for its fishing, boating and water skiing. The area attracted half a million tourists annually, rivaling Yosemite National Park.

Bombay Beach&#x27;s decline began in the 1970s, when the runoff (full of salty chemicals) led to a warning that the salinity of the lake would no longer sustain wildlife; that occurred by the early 1980s. Many residents around the Salton Sea, including those in Bombay Beach, were eventually driven out by the odor of the dying fish, the fear of health problems, and the flooding and the draining of the Salton Sea. Many of the remaining residents are reportedly either too poor to move out or too attached to the history of the area to leave. A report by the &quot;Pacific Institute&quot; in September 2019 stated that ten years earlier, &quot;there were some 100 million fish in the Sea. Now, more than 97 percent of those fish are gone.&quot;

Most of the few residents use golf carts to get around, since the nearest gas station is away in Niland. There are two stores in the town, one of which is a convenience store, and the closest hospital is over 45 minutes away in Brawley. The Ski Inn bar and restaurant is the only eating and drinking establishment in the town. The &quot;Bombay Beach Drive-In&quot; is an art installation consisting of old, abandoned cars at a drive-in theater. A visitor in 2019 wrote that there were many &quot;discarded homes and trailers long-since abandoned&quot; and that many of the buildings were &quot;windowless husks blanketed in graffiti, surrounded by broken furniture and rubble.&quot;

The derelict &quot;living ghost town&quot; status of Bombay Beach has attracted many photographers, filmmakers, urban explorers, and tourists. The town, as well as others on the shores of the Salton Sea, is one of the lowest settlements in elevation in North America. The local American Legion, Post 801, had 36 members in 2016 and closed down &quot;for a few years&quot; before reopening as a volunteer-run facility.

In 2018, as people began to move back into Bombay Beach, house prices had risen; some bungalows were selling for &quot;tens of thousands of dollars.&quot; The community has held the Bombay Beach Biennale each spring since 2016, inviting &quot;artists, academics, writers, and film-makers to create work, give lectures, and stage happenings&quot;. The 2020 Biennale was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The population of Bombay Beach has been described as &quot;mostly elderly residents&quot; who &quot;live in a grid of mobile homes and eccentric (and, sometimes, elaborate) small homes and shacks.&quot;

==Geography==

Bombay Beach is located in Southern California&#x27;s Sonoran Desert. Bombay Beach is located on the east shore of the Salton Sea and, like many communities along its shores, has had to contend with fluctuating water levels, reducing size of the lake and increasing salinity. A berm was built in the 1970s to protect the west end of the town, but a portion of the town beyond the berm was either submerged or half-buried in mud.

Bombay Beach marks the southern end of the San Andreas Fault, where the southern terminus of the San Andreas transitions into the Brawley Seismic Zone.

Bombay Beach features a large number of art pieces and installations around the town and along the beach.

<text>El Centro (Spanish for &quot;The Center&quot;) is a city and county seat of Imperial County, California, United States. El Centro is the most populous city in the Imperial Valley, the east anchor of the Southern California Border Region, and the core urban area and principal city of the El Centro metropolitan area which encompasses all of Imperial County. El Centro is also the most populous U.S. city to lie entirely below sea level (). The city, located in southeastern California, is from San Diego and less than from the Mexican city of Mexicali.

The city was founded in 1906 by W. F. Holt and C.A. Barker, who purchased the land on which El Centro was eventually built for about and invested $100,000 ($ in dollars) in improvements. The modern city is home to retail, transportation, wholesale, and agricultural industries. There are also two international border crossings nearby for commercial and noncommercial vehicles. El Centro&#x27;s census population as of 2020 was 44,322, up from 42,598 at the 2010 Census.

==History==
Spanish explorer Melchor Díaz was one of the first Europeans to visit the area around El Centro and Imperial Valley in 1540. The explorer Juan Bautista de Anza also explored the area in 1776 (an elementary school in El Centro now bears his name). Years later, after the Mexican–American War, the northern half of the valley was annexed by the U.S., while the southern half remained under Mexican rule. Small scale settlement in natural aquifer areas occurred in the early 19th century (the present-day site of Mexicali), but most permanent settlement (Anglo Americans on the U.S. side, Mexicans on the other side) was after 1900.

Originally part of San Diego County, the Imperial Valley was settled by farmers once water from the Colorado River was diverted via canals to irrigate the desert valley floor.

In 1906, the land on which El Centro was later built was purchased by W. F. Holt and C.A. Barker.

In 1907 Imperial County was split off from San Diego County; by then much of the valley was successfully irrigated.

Before the town began, the railroad had established a station and named the place Cabarker. The name honored C.A. Barker, a friend of the landowner. The first post office in El Centro opened in 1905.

Early growth was rapid with the city&#x27;s population reaching 1,610 by 1910 and more than tripling by 1920 to 5,646 people. One reason for this rapid early growth was El Centro&#x27;s successful battle with the City of Imperial to become the county seat. In these early days, relationships among the cities of the Imperial Valley were often intensely competitive, reflecting the particular frontier character of the area and the fact that six cities within a twenty-mile radius were all established within one generation. These cities were in a horse race to win the prize of being the Valley&#x27;s leading city and the intense competition is measured by the fact that it took twenty years to get a county fair started because of strong local loyalties on the County Board of Supervisors.

The City of El Centro was incorporated on April 16, 1908. One reason for this rapid growth was El Centro&#x27;s becoming the county seat of Imperial County.

In 1940, El Centro experienced a 7.1 earthquake, and population growth accelerated through the 1940s. By the mid-1940s, El Centro had become the second largest city in the Imperial Valley, with a population of about 11,000 people. El Centro had also become the location of the Imperial Irrigation District (IID) administrative offices.

Agriculture has been an important industry within El Centro since the early 20th century. Due to its strategic location near rail lines and U.S. Highways 80 and 99, more than 35 growers and shippers still operate in El Centro. However, by the early 1980s the two largest employment sectors in El Centro were government and wholesale/retail trade, reflecting El Centro&#x27;s emerging role as a regional administrative and commercial center.

Imperial Valley Mall opened on the southeast side of the city in 2005.

==Sites of interest==
The nearby Algodones Dunes, the largest dune field in the US, draws thousands of visitors each year, mainly for off-road driving. The Salton Sea lies north of El Centro, but water sport enthusiasts head to the Colorado River, to the east near Yuma, Arizona. The El Centro Naval Air Facility to the west is home to the annual Blue Angels flight maneuvering event. Stark Field is home of a minor league baseball team El Centro Imperials of the Arizona Summer League. Mexico (the border city of Mexicali, Baja California) is away, which offers big city amenities like museums, a zoo and a sports/convention center.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which over 99% is land.

El Centro is located in the Imperial Valley (considered locally as synonymous with Imperial County). The city is below sea level and the largest city in the United States below sea level. The Imperial Valley is in the Colorado Desert, an extension of the larger Sonoran Desert.

The agriculture industry&#x27;s demand for water is supplied by canals diverting water from the nearby Colorado River. The Salton Sea was created after a 1905 flood from the Colorado River.

The El Centro earthquake of 1940 had a moment magnitude of 6.9 and a maximum perceived intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It was the first major earthquake to be recorded by a strong-motion seismograph located next to a fault rupture. It was intensely studied by structural engineers and assumed to be typical until the Northridge earthquake of 1994. In this region, the geology is dominated by the transition of the tectonic plate boundary from rift to transverse fault. The southernmost strands of the San Andreas Fault connect the northernmost extensions of the East Pacific Rise. Consequently, the region is subject to earthquakes, and the crust is being stretched, resulting in a sinking of the terrain over time.

===Climate===
El Centro has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BWh&quot;) and is the southernmost desert city below sea level in the continental United States. It features long, extremely hot summers, and mild winters. El Centro has over 350 days of sunshine and under of rain annually. Winter temperatures are in the mid to high 60s °F (mid to high 10s °C) with over-night lows in the low 40s °F (mid +0s °C) . During summer days of June; typically the driest month of the year with no precipitation, the dry, desert heat can push temperatures well above , while the nights stay in the high 70s °F (high 20s °C). 

The North American Monsoon typically increases moisture. At times, the climate can resemble that of tropical areas in the Caribbean due to Gulf of California moisture surges. Humid air from the gulf surges northward into the Imperial Valley and El Centro area, making the summer heat oppressive at times. This leads to daily thunderstorms that can bring hail, downpours, lightning, and dust storms, more commonly known as Haboob. 

During the Eastern Pacific Hurricane season, remnants of hurricanes or tropical storms may track through the desert and can result in heavy thunderstorms. This can lead to significantly higher than normal precipitation, at times bringing heavy rain. A few examples of this are Hurricane Hilary (2023) and Hurricane Nora (1997)

The precipitation in the winter months is predominantly rain showers from the occasional winter storms. At times these storms bring cold temperatures to El Centro and surrounding cities, and mountain snowfall to the nearby Mountains. El Niño and La Niña play a large role in how much rain falls in the winter, La Nina typically brings drier and cooler conditions to El Centro and surrounding areas. El Niño tends to being wetter and average temperatures.

Snow is almost totally unknown in the area. However, on December 12, 1934, a very powerful winter storm brought record cold and snowfall to El Centro and surrounding areas of the Imperial Valley. Snow began falling at 8:45 p.m. December 11 and by 5 a.m. the next day (December 12) of snow had blanketed the desert floor.

Another instance of freezing precipitation was observed in December 1967 as a mix of sleet hail. On average there are about 15 days that dip into the mid to lower 30s °F (mid to lower +0s °C).

Being below sea level, El Centro has warm days and cool nights in winter. The coldest daily maximum on record is on December 14, 1967, and the mean for the coldest day is at for the reference period between 1991 and 2020. The warmest low temperature on record is , recorded on August 30, 1976. The mean for the hottest night annually is at .

==Economy==

As of 2009 the employment of El Centro residents is dominated by the local government, California state government, and federal government. Two nearby prisons (Centinela and Calipatria) and a U.S. Border Patrol station provide employment; &quot;The Economist&quot; states that the prisons and border patrol were &quot;relatively untouched&quot; by the late-2000s recession. The El Centro area has many farming plots, where carrots, lettuce, and other crops are produced, and therefore the El Centro economy is subject to seasonal variations like other farming areas. Between November and March in winter periods, El Centro-area farmers harvest lettuce for $8–10 per hour. During March the harvest moves to the north and is no longer in El Centro; in previous eras farmers migrated, while in the first decade of the 21st century many collect unemployment benefits during the summer.

El Centro is surrounded by thousands of acres of farmland that has transformed the desert into one of the most productive farming regions in California with an annual crop production of over $1 billion. Agriculture is still the largest industry in Imperial County and accounts for 48% of all employment.

Being the commercial center of Imperial County, fifty percent of the jobs in the El Centro come from the service and retail sector.

A recent growth in the interest of Imperial County as a filming location, has spurred growth in servicing this industry. Due to its desert environment and proximity to Los Angeles, California, movies are sometimes filmed in the sand dunes outside the agricultural portions of the Imperial County. These have included &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, &quot;Stargate&quot;, &quot;The Scorpion King&quot;, &quot;Jarhead&quot;, &quot;Into the Wild&quot;, and &quot;American Sniper&quot;.

===During the late-2000s recession===
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of April 30, 2009, the El Centro area had a 25.0% unemployment rate, the highest for a Metropolitan Area in the country. By August of that year, El Centro&#x27;s unemployment rate was 27.5%, three times the overall United States unemployment rate of 9.7%. &quot;The Economist&quot; stated that the city is not the &quot;centre of the Great Recession&quot; like the figure would appear to indicate. While El Centro has a seasonal farming economy, there is still a fixed &quot;baseline&quot; unemployment at 12%. Timothy Kelly, the head of the Imperial Valley Economic Development Corporation, estimated that between 40,000 and 60,000 residents of Mexicali work in El Centro. &quot;The Economist&quot; added that there are likely many El Centro residents who work in Mexicali and collect unemployment benefits in El Centro; Ruben Duran, the city manager of El Centro, said that if the Mexicali jobs were factored into the employment rate, El Centro would have a normal employment rate. The manager of a job search agency called One Stop, said that about 3,000 people per month come into her agency; she says that some make a genuine effort to find jobs, while many do not have motivation to actually find a job, but to instead show proof that they tried to find a job. Kelly stated that unemployment fraud does not account for all of the issues with the El Centro area; he said that many residents have a lack of education and a lack of English language proficiency, so some of them cannot find jobs. &quot;The Economist&quot; added that the collapse of the housing market eliminated some construction jobs; the magazine countered that the scenario is true in many places in the United States. In December 2008 listed as No. 5 on Forbes.com&#x27;s list of &quot;The Top 10 Places in America Where Homes are Losing their Value Fastest&quot; with 31.4% of homeowners owing more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. A national report on the effects of the &quot;Great recession&quot; of 2008/09 has found El Centro and the Imperial Valley in the top 5 poorest medium-sized cities in the U.S. in poverty and unemployment rates.

==Parks and recreation==

==Culture==
While the majority of the residents in this community are Hispanic, there is a diverse population with a wide array of interests. In the winter, residents race on nearby sand dunes using four-wheel-drive buggies. During the summer, residents spend time indoors instead of outside. Spanish is a dominant language among residents and over the radio. Many area residents live in both the United States and Mexico and go across the border frequently.

<text>Holtville (formerly, Holton) is a city in Imperial County, California. Holtville is located east of El Centro. The population was 5,939 at the 2010 census, up from 5,612 in 2000.

==History==
The city was founded in the 1880s by Swiss-German settlers, many of whom entered from Mexico. The construction of railroads in the 1890s, the All-American Canal in the late 1940s, and U.S. Route 80 in the 1920s (later converted to Interstate 8 in the 1970s) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) economic boom in the 1990s brought more people to Holtville and the Imperial Valley.

The city of Holtville, which was originally called &quot;Holton&quot;, was founded in 1903 by W.F. Holt, and incorporated on June 20, 1908.

<text>Imperial is a city in Imperial County, California, north of El Centro.

As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 14,758. It is part of the El Centro metropolitan area. In 2016, Imperial was the fourth fastest-growing city in the state, gaining 4.1 percent more residents from January 1, 2015, to January 1, 2016. It compares to Imperial County&#x27;s growth of 1.3 percent and Brawley&#x27;s growth of 1.2 percent.

==History==
Imperial was created by the Imperial Land Company and was named by George Chaffey. Imperial&#x27;s first post office opened in 1901. Imperial incorporated in 1904. The first mayor of Imperial was Allison Peck.

The town-site of Imperial was plotted in 1902 for home and commercial businesses. Its first buildings included a printing press, drug store, grocery store, brick building, and church. The city can also boast of having the first school in the valley and the first Chamber of Commerce.

The City of Imperial was incorporated July 12, 1904, thus being the first city in the valley to incorporate. The city was originally thought to become the county seat, but lost out to the City of El Centro in 1907.

Imperial through the years became the location for the home of the Imperial Irrigation District, the California Mid-Winter Fair and the Imperial County airport. Also several businesses were established in the city. Imperial was devastated by earthquakes in 1916 and 1940. In 1979, Another earthquake destroyed many of the old buildings in the downtown business area, including City Hall. The city was slow to rebuild the business district following the quake, taking several years.

In June 2014, a McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II from Marine Corps Air Station Yuma crashed in a residential area. The pilot ejected safely, and no residents were injured.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Imperial is located in the Imperial Valley (considered locally as synonymous with Imperial County). The city is 59.5 feet (18.14 m) below sea level. The Imperial Valley is in the Colorado Desert, an extension of the larger Sonoran Desert.

The agriculture industry&#x27;s demand for water is supplied by canals diverting water from the nearby Colorado River. The Salton Sea was created after a 1905 flood from the Colorado River.

In this region, the geology is dominated by the transition of the tectonic plate boundary from rift to transverse fault. The southernmost strands of the San Andreas Fault connect the northernmost extensions of the East Pacific Rise. Consequently, the region is subject to earthquakes, and the crust is being stretched, resulting in a sinking of the terrain over time.

===Climate===
Imperial has a hot desert climate, featuring long, extremely hot summers and mild winters. Imperial averages just about 3 inches of rain annually, with December being the wettest month. The North American Monsoon typically increases the humidity from July through September. At times, the climate can resemble that of tropical areas in the Caribbean. This leads to daily thunderstorms that can bring hail, downpours, lightning, and dust storms more commonly known as Haboob. During the eastern Pacific hurricane season, hurricanes occasionally track up the Baja California Peninsula and bring remnants of Tropical Storms through the desert that can result in flash flooding and heavy widespread thunderstorms. This can lead to significantly higher than normal precipitation, at times bringing heavy rain in short periods of time. The precipitation in the winter months is predominantly rain showers from the occasional winter storms. At times these storms bring cold temperatures to Imperial and surrounding cities, and mountain snowfall to the nearby mountains. Snow is almost totally unknown in the city, except for trace amount on December 12, 1932, and a very brief fall of sleet mixed with hail during a shower in December 1967. On average there are 3.7 days per year that drop below freezing. In the coldest month, December, the normal high temperature is 67.5 degrees with a low of 42.3. In the warmest month, August, the normal high temperature is 104.5 degrees with a low of 78.4.

<text>Salton City is a census-designated place (CDP) in Imperial County, California. It is the largest Imperial County development on the Salton Sea coast. It is part of the El Centro, California Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 3,763 at the 2010 census, up from 978 in 2000. The reported population for 2020 was 5,155.

Although planned and developed as a large resort community with an extensive road, water, sewer and power grid capable of supporting 40,000 residents on 12,000 residential lots, demand for property in Salton City fell drastically short of the planners&#x27; expectations. According to the 2010 census, 81% of the surveyed lots in Salton City remain undeveloped, and 38% of the habitable residences in Salton City are unoccupied. Despite Salton City&#x27;s higher population compared to nearby Salton Sea communities such as Bombay Beach and Desert Shores, the eerie, mostly-abandoned appearance of the area has led some to call it a modern ghost town.

== History ==
Salton City was developed in the 1960s and established in 1958 primarily by M. Penn Phillips and the Holly Corporation, the Texas-based oil refiner and land developer. It was intended to be a resort community on the Salton Sea, a saline, endorheic rift lake located directly on the San Andreas Fault, yet by 1965 limited development was achieved due to its isolation and lack of local employment opportunities and the downfall of the town began.

In the 1970s, most of the buildings constructed along the shoreline, including the city&#x27;s marina were abandoned due to rising sea elevation. In the 1980s, the Imperial Irrigation District took proactive water conservation measures to reduce the flow of unused canal water into the Salton Sea. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, as salinity and suspected pollution levels in the Salton Sea increased, the attraction of the Salton Sea as a recreational destination diminished. Most of the original tourist related structures fell during this time, including the Truckhaven Cafe, the Salton Bay Yacht Club hotel and restaurant, and the Holly House motel and restaurant (later renamed Desser House and then the Sundowner).

In the 2000s, development in Salton City began to rise as a result of the escalating California housing market. Cheap land and housing costs, improvements to Highway 86, and a casino opened by Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians attracted new residents.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land. This area makes Salton City the largest city or town in terms of land area in the Imperial Valley.

Salton City is located on relatively flat ground. Several washes flow from the mountains to the west creating small gorges where any flowing run-off will drain into the Salton Sea. The vegetation consists of mostly sparse desert shrubs; however, in developed areas a variety of palm trees as well as other deciduous trees survive. Salton City is positioned between the eastern slope of the Peninsular Ranges and the western coast of the Salton Sea.

Earthquakes are an extremely common occurrence around the Salton Sea, and in Salton City, due to dozens of fractured fault lines that run through Imperial County. Salton City is also mere miles from major, destructive fault lines, such as the Imperial Fault, the San Andreas Fault, and the San Jacinto Fault. The Superstition Faults also pose a major risk to the area, as well as the Brawley Seismic Zone, which produces frequent yet mostly non-damaging earthquake swarms. At certain times, this area can experience dozens of felt earthquakes in a time period lasting from one day to over one week. Most of the earthquakes are minor to moderate and pose no hazard due to strict seismic codes; however, the area is notorious for earthquake swarms and other major seismic events. The San Andreas Fault begins at Bombay Beach where the southern terminus of the San Andreas transitions into the Brawley Seismic Zone, about ten miles across the Salton Sea from Salton City. Most residents are fully accustomed to minor and moderate earthquakes, but are prepared for a large one.

To the north of the CDP are Salton Sea Beach and Desert Shores. Salton City is approximately from the Imperial County seat of El Centro and 110 and 115 miles respectively from the coastal San Diego County cities of Oceanside and San Diego.

===Climate===
This area has a large amount of sunshine throughout the year, due to the amount of descending high pressure aloft. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Salton City has a hot desert climate. However, Salton City experiences its own microclimate due to the proximity of the warm lake waters. Humidity is significantly higher along the shore during the warmer months, from May through September. Its climate can mimic a tropical climate at times, with exceptionally high dewpoints for an arid desert, but this typically happens for only a part of the day, or a few days in a row at the most. Once winds prevail from the northwest, the climate is similar to other areas in Imperial County that are not along the Salton Sea. Salton City itself is extraordinarily dry, and did not measure an inch of rain between September 2016 and August 2021. Any rain is rare, and even moderate rain can cause road closures, roads washed out, and other damage. The area is not equipped to handle any rainfall.

<text>Big Pine (formerly Bigpine) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Inyo County, California, United States. Big Pine is located approximately south-southeast of Bishop. Its population was 1,756 at the 2010 census, up from 1,350 at the 2000 census. The Big Pine Band of Owens Valley Paiute Shoshone Indians of the Big Pine Reservation bases their tribal headquarters there.

==Geography==
Big Pine is located in the Owens Valley of California between the Sierra Nevada and the White Mountains, just west of the Owens River upstream of its diversion into the Los Angeles Aqueduct. It lies on U.S. Route 395, the main north–south artery through the Owens Valley, connecting the Inland Empire to Reno, Nevada. US 395 also connects Big Pine to Los Angeles via State Route 14 through Palmdale.

To the East, CA route 168 crosses the White Mountains over Westgard Pass to the basin and range province of Nevada, while Death Valley Road leads to Death Valley. The plaque beneath the young giant sequoia (pictured), referred to as the Roosevelt Pine, at the road junction says it was planted in 1913 to commemorate the opening of Westgaard Pass to auto traffic. The landmark giant sequoia was felled on September 28, 2020, after most of its foliage had died following its sole water source drying up in the 2017-18 drought. North from Westgaard Pass lies the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest, home to the oldest trees in the world.

To the West, Glacier Lodge Road leads high up Big Pine Creek into the Sierra, to lakes, hiking trails, fishing, and rock climbing underneath the Palisades Range and the Palisade Glacier.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , over 99% of its land.

== Piper v. Big Pine (1924) 193 Cal. 664 ==
In 1923, Alice Piper, a 15-year-old Native American living in Big Pine, wanted to attend Big Pine school, but was denied on grounds of her ethnicity. Piper, the daughter of Pike and Annie Piper, sued the school district, claiming the state law establishing separate schools for “Indian children” and other children of Asian parentage was unconstitutional.

The State Supreme Court ruled unanimously that because Alice Piper&#x27;s father was a tax-paying citizen, that Alice Piper therefore qualified as a citizen under the Dawes Act. The court did not, in fact, find that her 14th Amendment rights had been violated. Nonetheless, Alice Piper was invited as a pupil and her victory along with the passage the &quot;Indian Citizenship Act&quot;, on the same day opened the door for her and other Native American children to attend public schools in the state of California. Because of this, the Big Pine School District is memorialized as a major player in the constitutional battle over the rights of Native Americans to attend public schools segregated for “whites only.”

The Piper case has become a landmark case and is viewed as the legal authority guaranteeing Native American children the right to attend public schools. It has been used as precedent in other cases such as Brown v. Board of Education.
