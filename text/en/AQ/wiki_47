<text>Bartow ( ) is a city and the county seat of Polk County, Florida, United States. Founded in 1851 as Fort Blount, the city was renamed in honor of Francis S. Bartow, the first brigade commander of the Confederate Army to die in combat during the American Civil War. It is part of the Lakeland−Winter Haven Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had an estimated population of 787,404, as of July 1, 2022. According to the 2020 Census, the city had a population of 19,309.

Located near the source of the Peace River, Bartow is approximately east of Tampa, Florida and southwest of the Greater Orlando area. The city is near the center of &quot;Lightning Alley&quot; and has frequent afternoon thunderstorms in the summer, but typically has sunny and mild winters. Government, mining, and agriculture are the major sectors of the area&#x27;s economy. The primary roads in the Bartow area are U.S. Route 17, U.S. Route 98 and State Road 60, which provide access to locations throughout Central Florida.

The official city nickname is the &quot;City of Oaks and Azaleas&quot;. Three districts within the city are on the National Register of Historic Places. Other historic landmarks include the Old Polk County Courthouse built in 1909 and Bartow High School, formerly Summerlin Institute, the oldest high school in the county. Summerlin Academy now uses the space and was named for the historic school. Although Bartow has been eclipsed in population, importance and name recognition by other cities in the county, particularly Lakeland and Winter Haven, the city has retained its small city heritage and its distinctive Southern culture. With the annexation of of former phosphate mining land owned by the Clear Springs Land Company, Bartow&#x27;s population is projected to increase to over 25,000 by 2025 and over 45,000 by 2030.

==History==

A Spanish map of the Florida peninsula drawn in 1527 shows a native settlement called Rio de la Paz near present-day Bartow. Little is known about these Native Americans who made their home near present-day Bartow. It is likely that their population suffered high mortality from European diseases, such as smallpox and measles. The remnants of these pre-Columbian peoples probably joined the Creek Indians who migrated from the north to become the Seminole Indian tribe.

The first non-Indian settlement in the area was a colony of Black Seminole, free blacks and escaped slaves who established Minatti south of Lake Hancock in the late 1810s. These &quot;maroons&quot;, as they were commonly called, were slaves who escaped from Georgia and the Carolinas. The Black Seminole of Minatti were allies of the Red Stick Creek in &quot;Talakchopko&quot;, a village that preceded present-day Fort Meade. The Seminole leader Osceola had strong ties to Talakchopko. Many of the events leading up to the Second Seminole War were associated with Osceola and the Minatti war chief Harry. By the end of the Second Seminole War in 1842, both Minatti and Talakchopko had been destroyed by US forces.
The Armed Occupation Act of 1842 facilitated European-American settlement of the Florida peninsula in the 1840s, although the act prohibited settlement near the Peace River, as this was considered Seminole land. Enforcement of that part of the act was not strictly enforced; however, and settlers eventually moved into the area. As the settlement grew, the residents began to plant citrus trees and build one-room school houses and churches. In 1851, Fort Blount was established by Redding Blount. Bartow developed east of this site. At some point in the 1850s, Fort Blount was renamed as Peace Creek or Peas Creek, which was a translation of the Spanish Rio de la Paz of early maps.

About a month after the secession of Florida in 1861, the state established Polk County from the eastern portion of Hillsborough County. A few months later, the American Civil War began with the Battle of Fort Sumter. Because of the turmoil of secession and the war, the county had no official county seat for its first six years. The state legislature had directed the voters of Polk County to choose a site for the county seat and mandated that the site be named &quot;Reidsville&quot;. During the war, the area&#x27;s major contribution to the Confederacy was supplying food, particularly cattle and beef. The Union army and navy had effective control of the west coast of Florida, and many cattlemen retreated inland and formed the &quot;Cow Cavalry&quot; as a defense against Union troops. One of the wealthiest members of the Cow Cavalry was Jacob Summerlin. After Summerlin purchased the Blount property in 1862, he donated a large parcel of land to build a county courthouse, two churches and a school. Later that year, the town which had been known as Fort Blount, Peace Creek, Peas Creek, and briefly Reidsville, was permanently renamed Bartow in honor of Francis S. Bartow, the first Confederate brigade commander to die during the war.
Bartow recovered slowly from the war. The first Polk County Courthouse was built in 1867, which firmly established the city as county seat. Although Florida formally rejoined the union in 1868, the Reconstruction era did not end in Florida until 1877.

The 1880s and 1890s were a period of growth for the city of Bartow; from 1880 to 1900, the city would grow from 386 residents to 1,983. On July 1, 1882, the town was incorporated as a city. In 1885, the Florida Southern Railroad, a north–south route from North Florida to Southwest Florida opened in Bartow. A year later, the Bartow Branch of the South Florida Railroad, connecting Tampa and Orlando, was completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://taplines.net/southflorida/southflorida2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The railroads were catalysts for growth of the area; during the Spanish–American War, the Bartow rail yards became a crucial part of the supply line directed at US troops in Cuba. In 1887, Summerlin Institute, the first brick schoolhouse south of Jacksonville, was built.

By the turn of the century, Bartow had become the most populous city south of Tampa on the Florida peninsula – larger than Miami or West Palm Beach.

As the city grew, a number of industries moved into the Bartow area. In the first few decades of the 1900s, thousands of acres of land around the city were purchased by the phosphate industry. Bartow would become the hub of the largest phosphate industry in the United States.

Polk County was the leading citrus county in the United States for much of the 20th century and the city has several large groves. In 1941, the city built an airport northeast of town. The airport was taken over by the federal government during World War II and was the training location for many Army Air Corps pilots during the war. The airport was returned to the city in 1967 and renamed as Bartow Municipal Airport.

For most of the 20th century, Bartow&#x27;s growth was modest, especially in comparison to the rest of the county and state. While other cities in Polk County aggressively annexed adjacent land and allowed rapid growth, the government of Bartow generally took a more cautious approach. Bartow&#x27;s growth was also limited because most of the land surrounding the city was owned by phosphate mining companies, making residential growth impractical. Although Bartow had been the largest city in Polk county in 1900, by the 1910 U.S. Census, Lakeland had surpassed it in population. Bartow remained the second largest city in the county until sometime in the 1950s, when Winter Haven superseded it.

In the late 1990s phosphate operations in the area moved southward, and much of the former phosphate land became available for sale. In 1999, Connecticut financier Stanford Phelps purchased the former Clear Springs phosphate lands east and south of city limits; he announced plans for an 18,000-acre development, the largest project in Polk County history. After nearly a decade of delays, the plan received final approval in 2009. The Clear Springs Development includes plans for more than 11,000 new homes, of commercial space, three schools, and a golf course. According to the Central Florida Regional Planning Council, Bartow&#x27;s population is projected to grow to over 25,000 people by 2015. When buildout of the Clear Springs Development is completed by 2030, the population of the city is projected to be over 45,000 residents.

==Geography and climate==

===Geography===
Bartow is located slightly southwest of the geographical centers of both Polk County and peninsular Florida.&lt;ref name=&quot;PolkVision/Our Region&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The city is approximately east of Tampa and southwest of Orlando. The cities of Bartow, Lakeland, and Winter Haven form a roughly equilateral triangle pointed southward, with Bartow being the south point, Lakeland the west point, and Winter Haven the east point. The city is located near the headwaters of the Peace River at Lake Hancock. Bartow is located within the Central Florida Highlands area of the Atlantic coastal plain with a terrain consisting of flatland interspersed with gently rolling hills.

According to the United States Census Bureau, in 2000 the city had a total area of , of which is land and (1.23%) is water. As a result of the annexation of over of undeveloped land, primarily the Clear Springs land, the area of the city has quadrupled to over with more annexation still pending.

===Physiography and soils===
Bartow is located on the South Central Florida Ridge, as classified by the USDA. Most soils in the Bartow area are sandy; other soils have sandy surface layers and clay subsoils, and the eastern outskirts of town have a clay-rich floodplain through which the Peace River flows. Drainage outside of the floodplain ranges from good to excessive for the most part except for a poorly drained band which cuts across the northern part of town. Much of Bartow is built on the Fort Meade soil series, which is well drained, high in organic matter, and rich in phosphorus, an uncommon combination in Florida, much appreciated by area gardeners.

===Climate===
Bartow, like most of Florida, is located in the humid subtropical zone (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfa&quot;). The climate of Bartow and other inland cities is slightly different than those cities on the coasts of Florida. Typically, the ocean or gulf tends to moderate the climate of cities on the coast. As Bartow is further from the coast than almost any other city in Florida, it tends to have higher daytime temperatures cooler temperatures at night. Regardless, the climate pattern prevalent throughout central Florida is evident in Bartow: hot, humid summers with frequent afternoon thunderstorms and relatively drier and milder winters.

On average, a tropical system brings hurricane-force winds to the Polk County area less than once every ten years, although the 2004 hurricane season in which three hurricanes hit within 44 days was a case study in the law of averages. Until 2004, the most recent storm to bring hurricane-force winds to the Bartow area had been Hurricane Donna in 1960.
While Florida&#x27;s vulnerability to hurricanes is well known, hurricanes are not the most common severe weather threat seen in the Polk County area. The area is in the center of &quot;lightning alley&quot;, the most concentrated lightning strike area in the United States. Lightning is not the only threat from central Florida thunderstorms. The more severe storms bring the threat of tornadoes, although Florida tornadoes very rarely reach the size of those elsewhere in the United States. Even hail is not out of the question; one storm in March 1996 caused a one-foot accumulation of hail in areas of Bartow.

Freezes are an occasional occurrence in the Bartow area and can be a problem if temperatures remain below freezing for a sustained period of time. On average, the area can expect an annual minimum temperature of , putting it in plant hardiness zone 10a. Snow is a rare phenomenon in the area, perhaps a few times every century.

===Religion===
The first two churches built in town, the First Baptist and the First Methodist churches, were constructed on land given by the city founder Jacob Summerlin in 1867. Jacob Summerlin was known as the &quot;King of the Crackers&quot; and owned much of the land located around Bartow. These churches, although not housed in the original buildings, are still extant today. In 1919, more than 8,000 people came to Bartow to hear former baseball star and traveling evangelist Billy Sunday preach, which was twice as much as the population of Bartow and more than the population of the county&#x27;s largest city Lakeland at the time. As of 2010, there are more than 70 churches within the Bartow area.

Like most of the Bible Belt, Bartow has a high number of people affiliated with evangelical Protestant denominations with over 62% of churchgoers belonging to evangelical denominations. According to data published by the Glenmary Research Center in 2000, the denomination which has the largest number of adherents in Bartow is the Southern Baptist Convention with 27%, followed by the Roman Catholic church with 19%. Pentecostal/Charismatic churches are also prominent making up 17% of Bartow&#x27;s church attendance. The Pentecostal experience known as the Lakeland revival, which attracted controversy for its claims of supernatural healing, was started up the road at the Carpenter&#x27;s Home Church in Lakeland. Other churches which have a presence in Bartow include the United Methodist Church at 9%, and the Episcopal and Lutheran churches with 2% apiece. While there are no synagogues in town for Jewish Bartownians, Temple Emanuel is a conservative synagogue only away in Lakeland. There are two Muslim mosques and a Hindu temple in the county.

==Economy==
The economy of Bartow is driven by four sectors: government, mining, agriculture, and tourism. While Bartow&#x27;s population is less than 20,000, it is shaped by its proximity to several large centers of population. Within a radius of the center of town, there are close to 8 million people.

The dominant force in the economy of Bartow is city, county and state government. As a small city which is the seat of a county with over half a million people. In addition to city and county offices, there are also a number of regional, state, and federal offices located within Bartow city limits. Nine of the seventeen largest employers in Bartow are government entities. The largest by far is the Polk County School Board with over 12,000 employees. Other county entities which employ many people in the Bartow area include the county commission, the sheriff&#x27;s department, the clerk of court, the tax collector, and the property appraiser. The Florida Department of Transportation District One office is located in Bartow and is responsible for southwest Florida&#x27;s transportation needs.

There are several large businesses with headquarters elsewhere which were founded in Bartow. The large international law firm of Holland &amp; Knight was founded in Bartow in 1929. What eventually become the large Burdines and Sons department store chain was founded in Bartow in 1896 as Payne and Burdines. A couple years after opening his store, William M. Burdines opened a store in Miami and relocated his operations there.

Phosphate mining has been a major player in Bartow&#x27;s economy since the discovery of phosphate rock in 1881.
Polk County is part of the Bone Valley which is the richest source of phosphate rock in the world; 75% of the United States&#x27;s supply and 25% of the world&#x27;s supply come from the Bone Valley. The largest employer in the phosphate industry is Mosaic which employs over 3,000 people in the area.

In terms of area, Polk County has dedicated to agriculture. According to the US Census of Agriculture, Polk County is the top citrus production county in Florida. Polk County is also ranked second in the state in production of honey and fourth in number of heads of cattle. Since 1997 the new bumper crop in the area is blueberry. From 2000 to 2007 the area has more than doubled its production of blueberries and accounts for more than 35% of the state&#x27;s production of the fruit. While spring is usually a &quot;dead&quot; time for every other blueberry growing area in North and South America, Polk County blueberries peak from March to May.

Although there are no major tourist attractions in the immediate Bartow area, the city is located less than from both the Walt Disney World Resort and Busch Gardens Tampa Bay. The city is also less than from Legoland Florida in Winter Haven and Bok Tower Gardens in Lake Wales. As a city with many historical sites dating back over 100 years, Bartow is also a point of interest for those interested in historical sites and monuments.

==Culture==
===Annual festivals and other events===
There are several annual events in the Bartow area which have a long tradition. Many of these are large events which draw people from other communities to the city such as the Cricket Club Halloween Parade and Carnival held each year since 1942 or the annual Fourth of July Celebration held at Mosaic Park. The Bloomin&#x27; Arts Festival is an art show held in early March by the Bartow Art Guild. Every February brings the Annual L.B. Brown Festival at the L.B. Brown House on L.B. Brown Avenue (formally Second Avenue).
Bartow&#x27;s discarded natural Christmas trees are piled around a telephone pole for the annual New Year&#x27;s Eve bonfire, a unique tradition spanning more than seven decades which has sometimes been covered by national media.

The Polk County Arts Alliance based in Bartow is designated the official Art Agency by the county commission and is in charge of furthering the performing arts in the county. The Bartow Performing Arts Series sponsors five performances every year. The Imperial Symphony Orchestra is an ensemble of ninety volunteer musicians throughout the county who perform a dozen or so events every year including a concert &quot;under the stars&quot;. The city also has a volunteer band, the Bartow Adult Concert Band, which performs several shows a year. On the third Friday of every month, Main Street is blocked off for Friday Fest at 6 p.m. for a night of live music and entertainment, informally known as &quot;Tow Jam&quot; by natives.
===Historic buildings and landmarks===
The city&#x27;s Historic Architecture Review Board is responsible for the preservation, enhancement and promotion of historic buildings, landmarks and districts within the city. Three districts in the city, the Bartow Downtown Commercial District, the Northeast Bartow Residential District, and the South Bartow Residential District have been designated as historic districts. New construction within these districts is regulated by the board and they have the power to veto construction which might alter the character of the neighborhood.

While the towering oaks and ever-present azalea bushes which spawned the city&#x27;s nickname give many of the historic landmarks of the city a distinctive Southern &quot;look and feel&quot;, many styles of architecture are represented in Bartow&#x27;s historic buildings. The South Bartow and Northeast Bartow historic districts are characterized by masonry vernacular and various revival styles, while downtown is dominated by frame vernacular and classical revival styles. Other buildings on the National Register of Historic Places with distinctive architectural styles include the Thompson and Company Cigar Factory built in a Mission Revival Style and the L.B. Brown House built with distinctive Victorian ornamentation. The L.B. Brown House is notable as perhaps the only house still standing in Florida built by a freedman. The Old Polk County Courthouse, Bartow&#x27;s most recognizable symbol seen on its city seal, was built in 1909 in a neoclassical style. The Polk County Historical Museum is located in the Old Polk County Courthouse and consists of exhibits presenting local and regional history from pre-Columbian to present eras, along with a history and genealogical library.

Florida Senator Spessard L. Holland was born in Bartow. His home is located on South Broadway 2 blocks north of Bartow High School. Senator Holland was a founding member of the Holland and Knight Law Firm. The firm&#x27;s original office was located on South Central Avenue across the street from the Bartow Post Office.

There are several other notable buildings in Bartow which are not on the National Register of Historic Places. The Wonder House at 1075 Mann Road features natural air-conditioning (using rainwater), secluded outdoor bathtubs, and numerous mirrors that let occupants see who is at the door from other parts of the home. The current owners of the Wonder House are restoring it and plan to open a museum. The Thomas Lee Wilson House, also known as the Stanford Inn, at 555 East Stanford Street was the &quot;Sultenfuss Funeral Parlor&quot; in the movie &quot;My Girl&quot;. The house at 935 South Oak Avenue known as &quot;Windsweep&quot; was the residence used in the movie &quot;China Moon&quot;.

==Sports and recreation==

Many of the recreational opportunities in the area are outdoor activities designed to take advantage of the warm subtropical climate. There are eighteen parks in the City of Bartow Department of Parks and Recreation. Mary Holland Park, named after the wife of former Florida governor Spessard Holland, is a park with three lakes, a playground, an overnight camping area, and a skateboard park. The Bartow Civic Center is a complex with meeting rooms, concert facilities and a public pool. Bartow Park is a complex with softball, baseball and soccer fields and a track for remote control cars. The Bartow Golf Course is a par 72, 6,300 yard course designed by renowned golf course architect Donald Ross, with a restaurant and an area for barbecuing.

The Tour de Tow is an annual cycling tour held in September. The Fort Fraser Trail is a path leading from Bartow to South Lakeland. The path follows a converted CSX railroad line and is popular with area cyclists, joggers, and in-line skaters. Plans have been made to build a replica of the historic Fort Fraser along the path, as well as adding historical markers. Five picnic areas and six rest shelters are available along the path.

Polk County has over 550 lakes. Most of these lakes were formerly strip mines; they are closed to the public, only 88 of the lakes are open to the public via boat ramp access. The area has a national reputation for largemouth bass fishing and there are tournaments held weekly almost year-round. Some of the lakes on the east side of Bartow offer anglers the opportunity to catch 50 largemouth bass a day.

==Government and politics==

===Municipal government===

The City of Bartow has a commission-manager form of government. The city commission consists of five commissioners, each elected for a three-year term. The mayor is a member of the city commission elected annually by the commissioners, although traditionally the position is rotated. As of 2022, the mayor of Bartow is Steve Githens Other commissioners are Nick Adams, Leo Longworth, Tanya Tucker and Trish Pfeiffer&quot;. The city executive powers rest with the city manager, as contracted by the city commission. In 2010, the city&#x27;s budget was $74.2 million.

Electricity, waste disposal and water are municipal services provided by the city of Bartow to residents in city limits and nearby areas. Bartow is part of the Southwest Florida Water Management District and in times of drought, the city strictly enforces the restrictions set forth by the district. Although it is a private entity outside of the city limits of Bartow, the Bartow Executive Airport is governed and administrated by the city commission which convenes as the Bartow Airport Authority. As of 2016, the Bartow Police Department has five sergeants, twenty officers, three K-9 officers, two school resource officers, two public safety aides, and one parking enforcement specialist, while the Bartow Fire Department has 18 full-time firemen. The city of Bartow also operates the Bartow Public library, which was founded in 1897 and has reciprocal borrowing agreements with other public libraries in Polk County.

===Federal and state representation===
Bartow, as well as the rest of Polk County, is part of the so-called I-4 corridor. The I-4 corridor is seen by political analysts as the most politically competitive part of the state. Polk is considered the most conservative county in the corridor. Even though the majority of the residents of Bartow are members of the Democratic Party, outnumbering the Republican Party in party affiliation (53.3% to 31.7%), voters tend to support Republicans in most state and federal elections. In 2008 Republican presidential candidate John McCain&#x27;s lead over Democrat Barack Obama (53.6% to 46.5) in the city was larger than that of both the county and state.

All of Bartow&#x27;s local representation in the state and federal legislatures are members of the Republican Party. Bartow is represented in the state Florida House of Representatives by Ben Albritton. In the Florida Senate, Bartow is represented by Denise Grimsley. In the United States House of Representatives, Bartow is located in Florida&#x27;s 15th congressional district, and represented by Congressman Scott Franklin.

The Florida Department of Citrus has its headquarters in the Bob Crawford Agricultural Center in Bartow.

==Education==
The schools in Bartow are operated by the Polk County School Board, although several of them predate the establishment of the school board, and were autonomous at one time. Bartow High School, formerly Summerlin Institute, is the oldest high school in the county and one of the oldest high schools in the state of Florida. In 1923 Union Academy, became the first African-American high school in Polk County. Court-ordered integration began in Bartow during the fall of 1969, and the former black high school Union Academy became a middle school. In 1971, Summerlin Institute officially became Bartow High School, a name it had been known as informally at least since the early 1900s. There are currently seven elementary schools and two middle schools which are feeder schools of Bartow High School. Located at the campus of Bartow High School is the International Baccalaureate School of Polk County which offers an academically challenging environment and the Summerlin Academy which offers a military-oriented education.

It is expected that the rapid growth of the Clear Springs development will necessitate the building of at least two elementary schools and a middle school within the next twenty years. As part of this development, a new Polk State College campus called The PSC Advanced Technology Center at Clear Springs is projected to open by 2012. This campus will be located near the intersection of State Road 60 and 80 Foot Road.

While there are currently no colleges or universities in Bartow, there are several within a radius of Bartow. The nearest university, University of South Florida Polytechnic is located northwest of city limits in Lakeland on a joint campus with Polk State College. 
Florida Southern College and Southeastern University are also located in Lakeland. Warner University is located to the east in Lake Wales.

==Media==

Bartow is part of the Tampa/St. Pete television market, the 13th largest in the country. There are two AM radio stations within the city: WQXM (1460 AM) and WWBF (1130 AM). These stations are part of the local Lakeland/Winter Haven radio market, which is the 94th largest in the country. In addition to the stations in the local market, people in the area have the choice of both Tampa Bay and Orlando area radio stations and as of the 2010 market sweeps several of the most listened to stations in the market are in the Tampa Bay area.

&quot;The Polk County Democrat&quot; is the only newspaper published within Bartow. It is a semi-weekly paper which began publication in 1931. The dominant daily newspaper is &quot;The Ledger&quot; out of Lakeland, although the &quot;Tampa Tribune&quot;, the &quot;News Chief&quot; out of Winter Haven, Florida and the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; have some circulation in town.

==Transportation==

The street grid of Bartow is a typical four quadrant grid with Main Street as the east–west axis and Broadway Avenue as the north–south axis. Broadway is co-signed with U.S. Route 98 in the northern commercial district and leads southward into the center of town before heading into one of the older residential sections of town. Main Street is the old State Road 60 leading into the historic heart of downtown Bartow.

The primary numbered routes going through Bartow are State Road 60 and U.S. Route 17 and U.S. Route 98. State Road 60 is a major state highway leading to both the Gulf and Atlantic coasts and is the major east–west route through town. Originally traveling along Main Street, State Road 60 now follows Van Fleet Drive bypassing the downtown area, and is commonly known as &quot;the 60 Bypass&quot; by locals. Heading east on State Road 60 leads to Lake Wales and on to Vero Beach, while westbound leads to Mulberry and eventually Tampa. U.S. 17 is the main north–south route on the east side of town. It is a four lane divided highway leading north to Winter Haven and south to Fort Meade. U.S. 98 is cosigned with U.S. 17 until its intersection with SR 60. Briefly cosigned with State Road 60 until its intersection with Broadway Avenue. US 98 then turns northward onto Broadway Avenue heading towards Lakeland. State Road 570, known as the Polk Parkway, is a toll road located (10 km) north of city limits on U.S. 98. The Polk Parkway provides direct freeway access to Tampa and Orlando via Interstate 4.

The explosive growth expected in the area in the next few decades has created a need for a reexamination of the area&#x27;s transportation infrastructure. The Central Polk Parkway is a proposed limited access highway that would connect the Polk Parkway with U.S. 17 and State Road 60. The Northern Bartow Connector, which was expected to be completed by 2015 but was shelved as of 2016, is a partial loop around the north part of town connecting U.S. 98 with State Road 60 east of town. However, the portion connecting U.S. 98 and U.S. 17 was completed in 2013.

For aviation needs, Bartow Executive Airport is available. The airport has a VFR control tower, three 5,000 ft runways - including two parallel runways, a restaurant with views of the airfield, and includes an industrial park and warehouse storage. Both Tampa International Airport (TPA) and Orlando International Airport (MCO) are within driving distance from the center of Bartow.

Bartow has its own bus system, the Bartow Shuttle, which runs from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday. The Citrus Connection has buses that serve the Bartow downtown area from Lakeland, and Winter Haven Area Transit serves Bartow from Winter Haven and Fort Meade.

==Library==
The Bartow Public Library is a member of the Polk County Library Cooperative. The library is located at 2150 S. Broadway Ave. Bartow, FL 33830. The library first started May 19, 1897 above Polk County National Bank. After obtaining a Carnegie Grant the public library was opened on February 8, 1915. It moved to the current location in 1998. The Polk County Historical and Genealogical Library is housed within the Polk County Historical Museum in the historic Old Polk County Courthouse and contains more than 40,000 items in its collection pertaining to history and genealogy of the eastern United States.

==Notable people==

As it is the county seat, many government officials and politicians have been associated with Bartow since its founding. Perhaps the most notable is Spessard Holland, former Florida governor and U.S. Senator, who governed the state during World War Two and introduced the Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibited use of the poll tax in federal elections. Holland had opposed previous civil rights legislation. Spessard L. Holland Elementary, named in his honor, opened in 2009. His predecessor in the U.S. Senate, Charles O. Andrews, also attended school in Bartow. Others who were raised and schooled in Bartow include former Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Stephen Grimes, former Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris, who had a key role during the 2000 U.S. Presidential election, and former U.S. congressman Adam Putnam.

The most notable military officer from Bartow is four-star general James Van Fleet, who was the commanding officer of the United Nations forces during the Korean War. Other generals associated with the City of Bartow include Albert H. Blanding, who served during World War One, and Confederate General Evander M. Law, who lived for his last forty years in Bartow.

Numerous men who became professional athletes were born, lived in or associated with the city of Bartow. Some were born in Polk General Hospital, a public hospital in Bartow which closed in 1995, but most were generally associated with other cities in Polk County. Born in Bartow and raised elsewhere in the county were NFL linebacker Ray Lewis, NBA guard Tracy McGrady, and motocross star James &quot;Bubba&quot; Stewart. Other athletes who were raised and educated in Bartow include former NFL defensive back (2023 Hall of Fame class) Ken Riley, former NFL defensive back Marcus Floyd, former Cleveland Indians outfielder Frank Baker, and former NASCAR driver Rick Wilson.

Other notable people from Bartow include Lake Eola Park founder Jacob Summerlin, January 2010 &quot;Playboy &quot; Playmate Jaime Faith Edmondson, centenarian Charlie Smith, lynching victim Fred Rochelle, and Ossian Sweet, a physician who challenged the color line in Detroit and was acquitted of murder charges.

<doc id="109701" wikidata="Q1889181" url="?curid=109701" title="Davenport, Florida">
<text>Davenport is a city in Polk County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Lakeland–Winter Haven Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 9,043 at the 2020 Census. The city&#x27;s population has increased dramatically since the 2010 Census, when the population was 2,888.

==History==
The settlement in the area now known as Davenport was established in 1838 when the US military set up Fort Davenport during the Second Seminole War, about 12 miles north of the present site of Davenport. The fort was one of a number built at 20 mile intervals along a trail from Fort Brooke to Fort Mellon. The fort only lasted a few years. The fort was named for Colonel William Davenport, who served as the local U.S. commander in the war. There is no known documentary evidence to support an alternative claim that the city was named for a railroad conductor.

The modern city of Davenport had its start in the 1880s when the South Florida Railroad was extended to that point. The settlement was first known as Horse Creek, for the creek first recorded on a US Army survey of 1849 which flows past the site to enter Snell Creek and eventually Lake Hatchineha in the Kissimmee River system. A post office was established at Horse Creek in 1884, and the name of the post office was changed to Davenport in 1886. Davenport was incorporated in 1915.

The South Florida Railroad opened a station half a mile north of the present site of the city. The railroad line was acquired by the Plant System in 1893, and the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1902. In 1926, it was replaced by a new station in the downtown area. It was later closed in the 1970s. From 1958 to 1986 there was a second station, the Vertagreen Railroad Station, opened only for the transportation of fertilizer and not for public use.

The amusement park failed in 1990, and the Royals left for Arizona and the Cactus League in 2003. The Baseball City name is now extinct, and the area around the stadium (which was demolished in 2005) has been redeveloped into Posner Park, a large outdoor shopping mall.

==History==

Fort Meade is the oldest city in Polk County, dating its origins to 1849, when it was established along a new military road from Tampa (Fort Brooke) to Fort Pierce following the Second Seminole War. The town and road were originally sited by then-lieutenant George Meade of the Corps of Topographical Engineers, whose commander named it for him. Around the start of the American Civil War a mounted volunteer company nicknamed the &quot;Hickory Boys&quot; was formed at the fort. The 1880s business district was located on old Wire Street (now Broadway), which was a casualty of four devastating fires. There are over 150 buildings which are designated as landmarks. In the 1890s, the Fort Meade Street Railway operated a horse-drawn service in the town.

The earliest known burial is John I. Hooker (1821–1862), located in the town&#x27;s Evergreen Cemetery. Fort Meade&#x27;s Christ Church (Episcopal) located at 1 North Cleveland Avenue, was built in 1889. It is a frame vernacular with Gothic Revival elements and was designed by architect J. H. Weddell. Located within the historic district, the church was used for the HBO motion picture &quot;Judgment&quot;, featuring Blythe Danner, Keith Carradine and Jack Warden (1990).
Future Confederate General Stonewall Jackson was stationed at the fort in 1851. The town was burned by Union forces in 1864 and all of the original structures were destroyed, except the second fort which was dismantled in the 1890s.

==Library==

===History===
The Fort Meade Public Library was founded in 1934 by the Fort Meade&#x27;s Woman Club. Although there was not enough space to house a library at the Woman&#x27;s Clubhouse, Mr. Ben Johnson, a real estate broker offered a vacant room at 212 West Broadway free of charge for the library. Club members solicited others in the community to donate books and magazines and club members donated their own materials. The library was run by club member volunteers and was open only a few days out of the week. After several years, the library outgrew its space and moved to a room on the second floor of city hall. Mrs. T.K. White managed the library and kept it open 15 hours a week but after a few years, the library once again needed to move. The Woman&#x27;s Club received permission to use the abandoned Chamber of Commerce building on 75 East Broadway for the public library. After failed efforts to receive state funding for the library Mr. Grady Courtney, city manager called a meeting for the city to take over the responsibility of the library. The vote was unanimous in favor of the public library and on May 1, 1965, Mrs. Codey Shirley took over management of the library, implementing the Dewey Decimal System. The library at this time had 4,000 resources and received a 200 book donation from Bartow Public Library. A new library building was completed in 1976. The Fort Meade Public Library is the first library to become a member of the Polk County Library Cooperative.

<text>Frostproof is a city in Polk County, Florida, United States. The city is located in southern Polk County on the Lake Wales Ridge. It is part of the Lakeland–Winter Haven Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 2,877 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The settlement in the area now known as Frostproof was established in 1850. This settlement, like many in central Florida at the time, was set up as a fort and was called Fort Clinch. The fort was named after the local Lake Clinch which was, in turn, named after the Seminole War commander Duncan Lamont Clinch.

This settlement was abandoned only months later. By the 1880s, Frostproof began to see its first permanent settlers as homesteaders were attracted to the abundant hunting in the area which included much deer and turkey, as well as ample fishing.

The name was a marketing ploy to convince potential landowners that the town has never had, and never would have, a frost that could destroy the large citrus-driven economy. However, only a couple of years later, a frost during The Great Freeze of 1895 killed most of the citrus in Frostproof. Prior to being named Frostproof, the town was named Keystone City. However, after being confused regularly with Keystone Heights, a city in North Florida, Frostproof was coined.

W.H. Overocker applied for the first post office here in 1892, with a name of Keystone City. Postal authorities disallowed it because there was already a Keystone Heights in Florida. Joseph Washington Carson suggested Frostproof as a substitute, but Overocker instead chose Lakemont. Carson&#x27;s choice of Frostproof was based on the town&#x27;s relatively minor damage from the freeze in December 1894, which ruined much of the state&#x27;s citrus crop.

Carson volunteered to deliver the application to the post office in Fort Meade and on the way changed the name from Lakemont to Frostproof, which was approved. Overocker, to his surprise, was appointed the postmaster of Frostproof. The early post office was located on the corner of Wall Street and Carson Avenue.

After many delays, Frostproof first received rail service in 1912. Frostproof&#x27;s Historic Train Depot no longer has passenger trains or freight arriving or departing; however, it is open for tours. 

The Historic Downtown District runs East and West between Lake Clinch and Lake Reedy on Wall Street.

<text>Haines City is a city in Polk County, Florida, United States. Its population was 26,669 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Lakeland–Winter Haven Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Haines City was platted in 1885, shortly after the South Florida Railroad reached the area. The city was first known as &quot;Clay Cut&quot;, but there was no railroad station. It is said that the inhabitants persuaded the railroad company to build a station by agreeing to rename their city Haines City, to honor a senior railroad official, former Confederate States Army Colonel Henry Haines.

Haines City was originally incorporated under the General Statutes of Florida as the &quot;Town of Haines City&quot; on February 23, 1914. The first state legislative act affecting it was enacted on May 20, 1919, and, by Chapter 8272, it was reincorporated as the &quot;City of Haines City&quot; on January 5, 1925, under a Mayor-Council form of government. The present charter was adopted as Chapter 12790 on July 1, 1927, changing the form of government to &quot;Commission-Manager Plan,&quot; as amended. The city operates under a commission-manager form of government and provides the following services as authorized by its charter: Public safety (Police and Fire), Streets and Highways, Culture-Recreation, Public Improvements, Sanitation, Planning and Zoning and General and Administrative Services.

The early settlers planted citrus groves, and citrus growing and processing became the main industry of the city.

From 1974 to 1986, Circus World, a theme park created by the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, was open just north of Haines City. After Circus World shut down, Boardwalk and Baseball opened on the same site. It featured carnival games and theme park styled rides like the Grand Rapids Flume. It closed in 1990, and the site has been redeveloped as a residential and shopping complex named Posner Park.

In recent years, Haines City has seen explosive growth, largely because of its easy access to Orlando and Walt Disney World Resort. New residential areas have been developed on the edges of the city. On high ground in the north of the city, Southern Dunes, a golf and country club with both vacation homes and residential homes, was developed between 1995 and 2005.
In 2004, Haines City experienced three hurricanes. Hurricane Charley passed through the city in August. Hurricane Frances came right on the heels of Charley but mostly just dumped a lot of rain. Hurricane Jeanne soon followed packing a punch not quite as strong as Charley but longer lasting. The city has since recovered.
Four years after Charley, Haines City got struck again this time by a weaker storm named Tropical Storm Fay. This storm caused little damage, but schools closed on the second day of the school year (Tuesday, August 19, 2008) due to it; the original plan had been to close schools Tuesday and Wednesday, but the lack of danger it showed on Tuesday caused the change in agenda.

===Park renovations===

A new park on Lake Eva, replacing a previous park on the site, was completed in 2009. The city has also built a new park, called &quot;8-Acre Park&quot;, and auditorium in the Oakland area, on the northern side of the city.

===Brush fire===

Haines City was the site of a brush fire on March 25, 2009. It was a scare to the residents of dozens of houses in a housing complex named Randa Ridge.

===Legoland===

Haines City is responding to the arrival of Legoland Florida in Winter Haven. Legoland&#x27;s expected tourist influx is leading Haines City to search for ways to advertise and bring more people to the historic downtown area, specifically, motorists coming down U.S. 27 from Interstate 4.

==Library==

The Haines City Public Library is a member of the Polk County Library Cooperative. It is located at 111 N 6th Street Haines City, FL 33844.

Haines City first established a library in 1916, under the direction of the Women&#x27;s Club of Haines City. The first library was located inside the Leisure Lodge, which was located on Railroad Park. In 1927, when that building was demolished as part of a street widening project, the library relocated to Hinson Avenue. The library was forced to relocate again in 1959 due to another street widening project, at which time the Women&#x27;s Club rented space for the library at the Palm Crest Hotel (also known as the Polk Hotel, which today houses the Landmark Baptist College). The City of Haines City assumed official responsibility of the library in September 1960, whereupon it moved the library to a building on Ledwith Avenue. The library moved to its current location on N. Sixth Street in 2012, and is co-located with City Hall. A non-profit organization, the Friends of the Haines City Public Library, Inc., provides support to the library.

In 1997, the Polk County Library Cooperative was created. This interlocal agreement between municipal and county governments allows all residents to receive library services and materials from any library within the county. The library co-op also supplies a mobile library and a Books by Mail service, which mails library materials to patrons without fees.

<text>Highland City is a census-designated place (CDP) in Polk County, Florida, United States. The population was 2,051 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Lakeland–Winter Haven Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
The modern-day area of Highland City was the site of the United States Army&#x27;s Fort Fraser, established in 1837 during its war with the Seminole Indians. Zachary Taylor, former U.S. President, commanded the fort for a short period. Fort Fraser was abandoned shortly after its construction.

In 1885, the Pemberton Ferry Branch of the South Florida Railroad was completed between Lakeland and Bartow. The area now known as Highland City was the only stop between the two larger cities. The stop, and eventual village, was named for the Haskell brothers, who were early investors in the South Florida Railroad. E. B. Haskell was a newspaper publisher from Boston, Massachusetts and his brother Dr. C. C. Haskell, of Maitland, Florida, was an original stakeholder in the South Florida Railroad. In addition to the town of Haskell, the South Florida Railroad&#x27;s #6 locomotive was named the E. B. Haskell.

The Haskell freight depot was built by the railroad company along the roadway that would later become U.S. Highway 98. (In 1958, the depot was demolished due to its proximity to the roadway, and was replaced by a new freight building). The first postmaster (and also the first freight agent of the depot) in Haskell, Thomas A. Goode, was appointed on February 9, 1887.

Developer W. F. Hallam had begun to develop the Lakeland Highlands area by 1924. Hallam built the Hallam Country Clubhouse in the area west of Highland City and the road accessing the clubhouse became known as Clubhouse Road. The development of the Highlands also brought an influx of new residents to the Haskell community.

In 1925, the community of Haskell was incorporated by the Florida legislature, which also had the effect of officially changing the community&#x27;s name to Highlands City. The city elected its first officials:

By 1927, the town&#x27;s official area was reduced due to a lawsuit brought on behalf of a few Highland City landowners. This ended the town&#x27;s short stint as an incorporated place.

==Name==
A common error in referring to this place is to add an &#x27;S&#x27; to the end of &quot;Highland&quot;, causing the name to incorrectly read &quot;Highlands City&quot;. For example, a new train depot, constructed in 1958, originally featured a sign with the mistakenly spelled &quot;Highlands City&quot; name. Lakeland Ledger reporter Courtland Anderson made special note of the error in the caption of his photo of the new depot.

When the community was briefly incorporated in the 1920s, the plural form was used.

== Modern Community ==
The Highland City Volunteer Fire Department (HCVFD) works in conjunction with the Polk County Fire Department to provide fire protection for the Highland City area. For many years, HCVFD operated the fire service in Highland City on a completely volunteer basis. In the last quarter of the 20th century, Polk County consolidated many of its fire districts, and the Highland City fire station became an official Polk County Fire Station, under command of the Fire Chief of Polk County.

As of 1996, the Highland City community had organized an active community group. The group&#x27;s goals included beautification, utility upgrades and safer neighborhoods.

On December 9, 2006, the community saw the grand opening of the Fort Fraser Trail, a 7.75-mile pedestrian and bicycle trail extending from the Polk State College campus south to Bartow.

==Geography==

Highland City is located at (27.962901, -81.879380).

Highland City&#x27;s street addresses put them on the Lakeland street grid; most street names have &quot;SE&quot; in their name, indicating that they are southeast of Lakeland&#x27;s &quot;point zero&quot; intersection of Florida Avenue and Main Street. However, Highland City is often considered to be culturally closer to Bartow than Lakeland. Highland City Elementary, primarily feeds into Bartow Middle School and Bartow High School. Unlike its nearest neighbor, Lakeland Highlands, which is somewhat affluent, Highland City is a working class area with many mobile homes.

The Highland City census designated place is located on U.S. Highway 98, northwest of Bartow and east of Lakeland Highlands.

<text>Lake Alfred is a city in Polk County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Lakeland–Winter Haven Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was approximately 6,374 at the 2020 US census. 

==History==

The city was established soon after the South Florida Railroad reached the area in 1883. It had a number of early names, including Fargo, Chubb and Bartow Junction.

The settlement was named Fargo by snowbirds escaping the cold of Fargo, North Dakota. They at first named the settlement after their hometown, but the United States Postal Service protested after a series of mix-ups with the town of Largo. The town then became Chubb and later Bartow Junction because it lay at the junction of a railroad leading south into the county seat Bartow.

The name Lake Alfred was adopted in 1913 and was taken from the nearest large lake, named after Alfred Parslow, who came to Florida in 1877 and obtained a charter to build the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railroad.

In 1917, the State of Florida established the first off-campus center for the University of Florida in Lake Alfred, the Citrus Experiment Station to study ways of improving citrus growing. Today this location is known as the UF/IFAS Citrus Research and Education Center.

==Lake Alfred Public Library==

Lake Alfred Public Library was started in 1962 by the Junior Women&#x27;s Club. It was housed in the Dees Building on West Haines Blvd. 1000 books were donated by Lake Alfred residents and merchants. The books were also processed by volunteers. Merchant W.R. Dees provided the storefront requiring a low enough rent that the Junior Women&#x27;s Club could pay. The club also held bake sales, rummage sales, and dances to raise money to provide for material needs such as furniture. The grand opening was October 1962. Within a year a larger storefront opened in the same building and volunteers once again moved the library. Volunteers ran the library causing for unpredictable hours in which the library was open. Sometimes it was only open 3 hours a week. In 1967, the city provided a small house in Lion&#x27;s Park for the growing library to move to, and in 1969, the city hired a part-time professional librarian, and funded new books and supplies. In 1972, the City of Lake Alfred created a library board made up of seven members appointed by the city commission and city manager. It was not until 1973 that Lake Alfred took over the ownership and responsibility for the Lake Alfred Public Library. It was moved to the new Public Safety building on Pomelo Street with the library in between the police and fire department. In 2012, the library moved to a new building on North Seminole Avenue after the Friends of the Library group received money bequeathed by Florida Citrus Hall of Fame member, Edwin Moore. The library is part of the Polk County Library cooperative. The library offers wireless printing, technology classes, print and e-books, WiFi, and children&#x27;s programming The library is located at 245 N. Seminole Ave. Lake Alfred, Florida 33850.

<text>Lake Wales is a city in Polk County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Lakeland-Winter Haven, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 16,361 at the 2020 census.

==History==

=== Early history ===
A survey by W.A. Williams and J. Jackson, deputy surveyors of the State of Florida was made of the region around present-day Lake Wales. The area was considered to be uninhabitable by early settlers. By 1879, the land around the present city was surveyed again by Sidney Irving Wailes, an agent for the Florida Land and Improvement Co., who changed the name of a lake, then known as Watts Lake, to Lake Wailes.

In 1902, G.V. Tillman scouted the region of Lake Wales and saw the potential for turpentine, citrus, and other industries. He developed the idea to settle the area around Lake Wailes.

=== Settlement ===

The city of Lake Wales was established near the lake in 1911–1912, planned by the Lake Wales Land Company. The spelling Wales was used for the city, although the lake is still generally spelled Lake Wailes. Allen Carleton Nydegger, a civil engineer, was contracted by the Lake Wales Land Company to plot out the community of Lake Wales. He and his crew camped on the shores of Crystal Lake and spent months plotting out the new community.

The City of Lake Wales was officially incorporated as a town in May 1917.

=== Florida Land Boom ===
In 1925, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad built a new line from Haines City joining lines to Everglades City. A depot was opened on this line at Lake Wales in 1928.

=== 21st century ===
In 2004, Lake Wales endured the effects of three hurricanes which came through the area: Hurricane Charley, Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Jeanne. The three hurricanes brought hurricane-force winds to the Lake Wales area within a space of 44 days. In 2017, Hurricane Irma brought more hurricane-force winds to Lake Wales.

==Geography==

The town lies near the geographical center of the Florida peninsula. Lake Wales is located on the Lake Wales Ridge, a sandy upland area running roughly parallel to both coasts in the center of the peninsula. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (4.71%) is water.

Lake Wales is located in Central Florida, west of Lake Kissimmee and east of Tampa.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification, Lake Wales has a humid subtropical climate, bordering on a tropical monsoon and dry-winter tropical savanna climate because of its hot days and warm nights, even in &quot;winter&quot;. January is the only month of the year that has an average daily mean temperature below . The town is in hardiness zone 9b. In 2004, the eyes of Hurricane Charley, Hurricane Frances, and Hurricane Jeanne all passed near the town. Virtually all physical damage has been restored.

===Wildlife and environmental lands===

Grassy Lake Preserve is a preserve located behind Janie Howard Wilson Elementary School. Grassy Lake is primarily made up of Lake Wales Ridge scrub land.

==Government and politics==

=== Municipal government ===
Lake Wales is governed by a five-person city commission under the Commission-Manager form of government. The day-to-day operations of the city are run by a professional city manager who is appointed by the elected city commission.

==== Elected officials and elections ====

In 2016, a Lake Wales police officer, Travis Worley, was accused by a whistleblower on the Lake Wales police force of calling a black suspect a &quot;nigger&quot;. The department suspended Worley for one day, but denied that he had used a racial slur. In 2019, he was named Lake Wales’ Officer of the Year.

<text>Lakeland is a city in Polk County, Florida, United States. Located along I-4 east of Tampa and west of Orlando, it is the most populous city in Polk County. As of the 2020 U.S. Census Bureau release, the city had a population of 112,641. Lakeland is a principal city of the Lakeland–Winter Haven Metropolitan Statistical Area. Lakeland is situated among several lakes including Lake Morton downtown and is sometimes locally referred to by the nickname &quot;Swan City&quot; due to its sizeable population of swans, all of whom are descendants of two mute swans given to Lakeland by Queen Elizabeth II in 1957. Lakeland is home to several colleges and universities. Lakeland Linder International Airport is in Lakeland as is the corporate headquarters of Publix, a supermarket chain.

European-American settlers arrived in Lakeland from Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and South Carolina in the 1870s. The city expanded in the 1880s with the arrival of rail service, with the first freedmen railway workers settling here in 1883. They and European immigrants also came because of land development opportunities with farming, citrus, cattle and phosphate industry developing. Lakeland is home to the .

==History==
===Early history===

In the 18th century Native Americans groups, collectively called &quot;Seminoles&quot;, moved into the areas left vacant. In 1823, the United States and the various tribes in Florida signed the Treaty of Moultrie Creek, which created a reservation in central Florida that included what is now Polk County. Starting in 1832, the United States government tried to move the Seminoles in Florida west to the Indian Territory. Most of the Seminoles resisted, resulting in the Second Seminole War, 1835–1842. By the end of that war, most of the Seminoles had been sent west, with a few remnants pushed well south of what is now Polk County.

===Statehood and the 19th century===
Florida became a state in 1845, and Polk County was established in 1861. After the American Civil War, the county seat was established southeast of Lakeland in Bartow. While most of Polk County&#x27;s early history centered on the two cities of Bartow and Fort Meade, eventually, people entered the areas in northern Polk County and began settling in the areas which became Lakeland.

Lakeland was first settled in the 1870s, and began to develop as the rail lines reached the area in 1884. Freedmen settled here in 1883, starting development of what became the African-American neighborhood of Moorehead. Lakeland was incorporated January 1, 1885. The town was founded by Abraham Munn (a resident of Louisville, Kentucky), who purchased of land in what is now downtown Lakeland in 1882 and platted the land for the town in 1884. Lakeland was named for the many lakes near the town site.

In April 1898, the Spanish–American War began and started a crucial point in Lakeland&#x27;s development. While the war ended quickly and had little effect on most of the nation, the Florida peninsula was used as a launching point for military forces in the war. The then small town of Lakeland housed over 9,000 troops. The 10th Cavalry Regiment, one of the original Buffalo Soldier regiments, were housed on the banks of Lake Wire. Soon after being stationed there, the black troops faced conflict with the local white population. In one event, a local druggist refused to sell to black soldiers and an argument ensued which eventually escalated to the point where the druggist brandished a pistol. The soldiers shot the druggist before he could fire, which resulted in two of the troops being arrested.

===The Florida Boom and the 20th century===
The Florida boom resulted in the construction of many significant structures in Lakeland, a number of which are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This list includes the Terrace Hotel, New Florida Hotel (Regency Tower, currently Lake Mirror Tower), Polk Theatre, Frances Langford Promenade, Polk Museum of Art (not a product of the 1920s boom), Park Trammell Building (formerly the Lakeland Public Library and today the Lakeland Chamber of Commerce), and others. The city also has several historic districts that have many large buildings built during the 1920s and 1940s. The Cleveland Indians held spring training there from 1923 to 1927 at Henley Field Ball Park. Parks were developed surrounding Lake Mirror, including Barnett Children&#x27;s Park, Hollis Gardens, and the newest, Allen Kryger Park.

The &quot;boom&quot; period went &quot;bust&quot; quickly, and years passed before the city recovered. Part of the reemergence was due to the arrival of the Detroit Tigers baseball team in 1934 for spring training. The Tigers still train at Lakeland&#x27;s Joker Marchant Stadium and own the city&#x27;s Class A Florida State League team, the Lakeland Flying Tigers. In the mid-1930s, the Works Progress Administration built the Lakeland Municipal Airport.

In 1938, Florida Southern College President Ludd Spivey invited architect Frank Lloyd Wright to design a &quot;great education temple in Florida.&quot; Wright worked on the project for over 20 years as Spivey found ways to fund it and find construction workers during World War II. Wright&#x27;s original plan called for 18 structures; in total he designed 30, but only 12 were completed. Wright&#x27;s textile block motif is used extensively on the campus. The concrete blocks he used are in need of restoration.

Wright titled the project &quot;Child of the Sun&quot;, describing his Florida Southern buildings as being &quot;out of the ground, into the light, a child of the sun.&quot; It is the largest single-site collection of Frank Lloyd Wright buildings in the world, and attracts 30,000 visitors each year. In 1975, the &quot;Florida Southern Architectural District&quot; was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 2012, Wright&#x27;s campus was designated as a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service.

===World War II===
At the beginning of World War II, the Lakeland School of Aeronautics—headquartered at the recently built Lakeland Municipal Airport—became part of a nationwide network of civilian flight schools enjoined for the war effort by the United States Army Air Corps.

Between 1940 and 1945, more than 8,000 Army Air Corps and Army Air Forces cadets trained on two-seater Stearman PT-17 and PT-13 biplanes at the school (renamed the Lodwick School of Aeronautics in the midst of this period).

From June 1941 until October 1942, 1,327 British Royal Air Force cadets trained at the Lakeland facility. The Lodwick School of Aeronautics closed in 1945. The airport ceased flight operations in the 1960; the site has since then housed the Detroit Tigers&#x27; &quot;Tiger Town&quot; baseball complex.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and (10.90%) is covered by water. Lakeland is within the Central Florida Highlands area of the Atlantic coastal plain, with a terrain consisting of flatland interspersed with gently rolling hills.

===Lakes===

The dominant feature in Lakeland is the city&#x27;s many lakes. Thirty-eight lakes are named, with a number of other bodies of water unnamed, mostly phosphate mine pits that eventually filled with water. The largest of these is Lake Parker, which is in size. Much of the culture of Lakeland revolves around its many lakes, and many people use the lakes as reference points in much the same way people in other towns use streets as reference points, such as &quot;I live near Lake Beulah.&quot; In addition to Lake Parker, some of the more prominent lakes in the Lakeland area are Lake Hollingsworth, Lake Morton, Lake Mirror, and Lake Gibson.

Swans are one of the most visible features on the lakes near downtown Lakeland. They have a long history, the first swans appearing around 1923. By 1954, the swans were gone, eradicated by alligators and pets. A Lakeland resident who mourned the passing of the swans wrote to Queen Elizabeth II. The royal family allowed the capture of two of the royal swans, and the swans now on the lakes of Lakeland are the descendants of the one surviving royal swan sent by the Queen.

In July 2006, Scott Lake, one of the city&#x27;s lakes, was almost totally drained by a cluster of sinkholes. Later the lake partially refilled.

===Climate===
Lakeland, like most other parts of Florida north of Lake Okeechobee, is in the humid subtropical zone (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfa&quot;). Typically, summers are hot and humid with high temperatures seldom dropping below 90 °F and 70 °F for the overnight low. Like most of Central Florida, afternoon thunderstorms are the norm throughout the summer. Winters in Lakeland are drier and warm, with frequent sunny skies. High temperatures range in the mid 70s during the day, with lows in the 50s. Cold snaps drop temperatures below freezing twice a year on average.

==Economy==

Lakeland is the largest city on Interstate 4 between Orlando and Tampa. Large industries in the Lakeland area are citrus, cattle, and phosphate mining. In the past few decades, tourism, medicine, insurance, transportation, and music have grown in importance.

Citrus growing dates back to the early settlers who planted trees in the area, in the 1850s. After a series of freezes in counties north of Polk County, the area became the focal point for citrus growing in Florida. Although citrus is no longer the largest industry in the area, it still plays a large part in the economy of Lakeland and Polk County.

Phosphate mining is still important to the economy of Lakeland, although most of the mining now takes place farther south. The Bone Valley produced 25% of the U.S. phosphate supply.

Lakeland&#x27;s largest employer is Publix Super Markets. Publix is one of the largest regional grocery chains in the United States with over 1,200 stores across the American South. Publix employs over 6,500 people in the Lakeland area including headquarter and warehouse employees.

Lakeland is a transportation hub. FedEx Freight and FedEx Services and the Saddle Creek Corporation employ over 600 people in the area. Other large employers in the area include Amazon, GEICO, Rooms To Go, and Lakeland Regional Health.

==Culture==
The Lakeland History Room is a special collections archive established in 1987 housed within the Lakeland Public Library&#x27;s main branch. The Lakeland History Room maintains the City&#x27;s collection of historical materials as well as other locally relevant collections composed of documents, photographs, maps, building plans, audio/visual media, scrapbooks, specialty items like citrus crate labels, artwork, yearbooks, posters, and postcards. The LHR maintains a large digital collection with over 7,000 images of the city of Lakeland, its landmarks, significant historical moments, cultural institutions, and prominent citizens. The LHR provides one-on-one assistance with historic research, a history lecture series with prominent local historians, a DIY Digitizing Lab for personal material preservation, and genealogical programs and resources.

In 2019, an initiative led by Lakeland City Commissioner Phillip Walker, was first presented to the City Commission to create the City&#x27;s first History and Culture Center. The project was unanimously approved by the Commission and funds were allocated for the project&#x27;s construction; although, the exhibit&#x27;s content design would be funded by local donations and grant funding. An advisory committee made up of educators, city officials, local business owners, and civic and community leaders, led by former Mayor Gow Fields, was established to organize and advise the City in the design, content, and construction of the exhibit. The Lakeland Public Library was eventually chosen as the location of the future exhibit space due to its central location within the city, its status as a community hub, and because it was the current home of the city&#x27;s local archive, the Lakeland History Room, which would be expanded into the Lakeland History and Culture Center. The History and Culture Center opened to the public in September 2022.

==Government and politics==

Lakeland is governed by a six-member city council. Four members are elected from single-member districts; the other two are elected at-large, requiring them to gain a majority of the votes. The mayor is elected.

===Mayor===
The City of Lakeland was incorporated on January 1, 1885. The mayor is one of seven members of the City Commission, acting as the board chair and performing mostly ceremonial and procedural duties beyond the powers of the other six. Prior to 1988, the City Commission selected Lakeland&#x27;s mayor from among its members. Mayors can be on the board for up to 12 years in a lifetime, or 16 years in combination with holding a regular commission position. Lakeland&#x27;s first mayor was J.W. Trammell.

The first female mayor was Lois Q. Searl, who served in 1965.
The 1970 municipal election placed the first African-American on the City Commission, Dr. John S. Jackson. In 1972, he became the first black mayor for the city.
In 1980, Carrie R. Oldham became Lakeland&#x27;s first African-American female mayor.

Since 1988, the mayor has been elected by the city&#x27;s voters.

===Mayors of Lakeland===


===Law enforcement===
On September 28, 2006, Polk County Sheriff&#x27;s Deputy Vernon &quot;Matt&quot; Williams and his K-9 partner Diogi were shot and killed after a routine traffic stop in the Wabash area of Lakeland. More than 500 police officers from a variety of law enforcement agencies joined in a search for Angilo Freeland, suspected of murdering Williams and stealing his gun. Freeland was found hiding in a rural area the next morning. Nine officers from five different law enforcement agencies surrounded Freeland and shot him when he raised Williams&#x27; stolen gun at them. A total of 110 shots were fired, and Freeland was hit 68 times, killing him instantly. Multiple investigations concluded the officers&#x27; use of force was justified. Deputy Williams and Diogi were laid to rest on October 3, 2006, after a funeral that included a one-hour-and-45-minute procession to Auburndale.

In 2021, the Lakeland Police Department hired numerous former NYPD officers. Two of the new hires failed to disclose that they had been disciplined by the NYPD, and one new hire used to work in the NYPD&#x27;s notorious anti-crime units which were disbanded after high-profile scandals.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
Because Lakeland is the largest city on I-4 between Tampa and Orlando, the city is an important transportation hub. The county nickname, Imperial Polk County, was coined because a large bond issue in 1914 enabled wide roads between the cities of Polk County.

The important freeways and highways in Lakeland today are:
* is the main interstate in Central Florida linking Tampa, Lakeland, Orlando, and Daytona Beach.
* (or Polk Parkway), is a tolled beltway around Lakeland, with both ends terminating at I-4. Although its shape, location, and tolls makes it impractical as a &quot;bypass&quot; road, it is useful as a way of getting from part of town to another and providing access to I-4 from most parts of the city.
* , following Memorial Boulevard for most of the city, was the route leading to both Tampa and Orlando before I-4 was built; US 92 is still a main road leading to Plant City going west, and Auburndale, Winter Haven, and Haines City going east.
* , going south, follows Bartow Road and leads to Bartow, the county seat. Heading north out of town, it provides a route to Dade City.

<text>Mulberry is a city in Polk County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Lakeland–Winter Haven Metropolitan Statistical Area, with parts of unincorporated Lakeland on its northern boundary. The population was 3,952 at the 2020 census. Mulberry is home to the 334-acre Alafia River Reserve.

==History==

The first white settlers appeared in the Mulberry area in the 1840s. The first industry in Mulberry was logging the longleaf yellow pine which dominated the area.

The town had no official name, but the railroad which came through town stopped at a mulberry tree to let off passengers and drop off the mail. The old mulberry tree became the de facto meeting place in town, and eventually gave the town its name. Several lynchings and hangings took place from this mulberry tree. In 1886, phosphate rock was discovered in the Peace River, and the dominant logging industry gave way to mining operations. The phosphate industry gave the town stability, leading to Mulberry&#x27;s incorporation in 1901. In 1910, Mulberry&#x27;s Masonic lodge was established and remains operational today.

===Florida Pebble Strike===

By 1919, many miners had joined the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers. In April of that year, the union called a strike asking for a minimum wage and an eight-hour work day, after which the mining companies brought in strikebreakers from Georgia. Electricity was cut off from both Mulberry and Fort Meade. On the evening of August 21, 1919, four mine guards for the Prairie Pebble Phosphate Company opened fire upon the town in an apparent attempt to break the strike, claiming that a man had shot at the power house in which they were sheltered. During the indiscriminate shooting, two adults were wounded and a two-year-old child was killed after being shot through the heart. Later that night, another black man was killed when the guards continued firing in Mulberry&#x27;s black neighborhood. The sheriff&#x27;s investigation found no evidence of a firearm in the accused man&#x27;s possession nor at the location from which it was claimed he had fired. After quelling the rage of the townspeople, who wanted to attack the power house and mine guards, the sheriff arrested the four mine guards shortly after midnight.

===Lynchings===

The Ku Klux Klan maintained a presence in Mulberry, with the last public march occurring in 1979. At least six black people were lynched in the early 1900s, as well as at least one white man.

==Transportation==

* State Road 37, which leads north toward Lakeland and south toward Bradley Junction Two rail lines intersect in the middle of the highway about a half mile south of the intersection of SR 37 and SR 60
* State Road 60, leading west toward Brandon and east toward Bartow and Lake Wales.
* Mulberry was served by two railroads. The line running east and west belonged to the Seaboard Airline Railroad while the north-south railroad belonged to the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. There is a combined yard that belonged to both railroads to the west and north of Mulberry proper and this is where the railroad interchanged traffic rather than at interchanges at the crossing of the two lines south of the downtown area. The crossing of the two railroads is very unusual as it takes place in the middle of a 4-lane divided highway crossing of traffic on State Road 37 at SW 2nd Street. Both of these railroad lines merged into the Seaboard Coastline in 1967 and in turn were folded into the CSX Railroad in 1986. Considerable traffic was and still is generated by the Bone Valley phosphate industry

==Education==

Public schools in Mulberry are operated by the Polk County School Board. The three elementary schools in the area are Kingsford, Purcell, and Sikes.

==Media==
Mulberry is part of the Tampa–St. Pete television market, the 13th largest in the country and part of the local Lakeland-Winter Haven radio market, which is the 94th largest in the country.

==Sinkholes==

On June 15, 1994, a sinkhole appeared in a toxic waste disposal pond near the city of Mulberry. Phosphogypsum, the byproduct of the phosphate fertilizer industry, is highly toxic and mildly radioactive. The 110 feet wide and 200 feet deep sinkhole dumped this toxin into caves that lead to the Floridan Aquifer. Drinking water for over ten million Florida residents comes from this aquifer.
The company mining the phosphate, IMC-Agrico, now a part of The Mosaic Company, started the sinkhole remediation process immediately. It has spent over $6 million trying to repair the damage to the Florida water supply.
On August 27, 2016, the Mosaic Company discovered a giant sinkhole under a gypsum stack. Over 200 million gallons of water contaminated with phosphogypsum disappeared into its 45-foot wide maw.

<text>Winter Haven is a city in Polk County, Florida, United States. It is located about east of Tampa and about southwest of Orlando, with neighboring Lakeland located to its west. The city&#x27;s population was 49,219 at the 2020 census, making it the second most populated city in Polk County after Lakeland. It is a principal city of the Lakeland-Winter Haven, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
===Pre-history===
The Timucua and the Calusa were the earliest known inhabitants of the Winter Haven area. Both of these groups were deeply affected by war and disease from the Spanish conquest of Florida in the early 1500s. The Timucua were particularly affected by the expedition of Hernando de Soto. By the 19th century, both these groups no longer existed. During these expeditions the Spanish explorers claimed the entire peninsula of Florida for the Spanish monarchy.

In the 19th century the Creek and the Seminole were known to live and hunt in this area. During the Seminole Wars the Seminole leader, Chipco, and his followers were known to live in the Winter Haven area. Several small skirmishes during the war were fought in and around Winter Haven.

===19th century===
In 1819, after the signing of the Adams-Onís Treaty, the United States gained control of Florida. The first American or European settlers in the area were encouraged to settle there by the Armed Occupation Act of 1842.

During the 1840s and 1850s, the United States government conducted the first surveys of the area. Henry Washington conducted the first survey of the area in 1843. In 1849, Dr. John Westcott completed an extensive survey of the area, including mapping many of the local lakes. The first maps of the area were published by the United States government in 1854. In 1883, Henry Haines working for Henry Plant and the Plant System, successfully built the first railroad across Polk County, passing just north of Winter Haven. Lake Haines, in Winter Haven, was named after Haines, who served as a colonel in the Confederate States Army.

The arrival of the railroad created the first real growth in area. The area was platted from 1884 to 1885, and would first be known as Harris Corners. This name was in reference to F.A.K. Harris, who opened the first mercantile store in the area around this time. The name Winter Haven was later suggested, in reference to the area&#x27;s pleasant climate.

===Early 20th century===
By the end of the century, the population grew to approximately 400 and on June 22, 1911, the City of Winter Haven was officially incorporated as a town. The Chain of Lakes canals were begun in 1915. The first Florida boom took place in the 1920s as towns sprang up all over the peninsula. Florida&#x27;s potential as a place to live and a place to visit was first realized in the 1920s, but the Great Depression slowed growth until after World War II. On November 27, 1923, Winter Haven was officially reincorporated from a town to a city. Winter Haven Hospital was founded in 1926 and has been in the city ever since.

During this period, the population of Winter Haven began to grow substantially. Many beautiful single-family homes were built in Winter Haven at this time in the colonial revival style. Over 50 these homes are on the National Register of Historic Places today. They are noted for their architectural style and grace. Most of these historic homes are located in the Interlaken neighborhood. There are four historic districts in Winter Haven. They are Interlaken, Pope Avenue, Winter Haven Heights, and the downtown area.

===Growth and development===
In 1930, George W. Jenkins opened the first Publix supermarket in Winter Haven. His second store and the first stand-alone Publix store, was a 27 ft by 65 ft building at 199 West Central Avenue, opened in 1935, which exists today as the Regenerations thrift store. During the 1930s and 1940s, citrus magnate, John A. Snively operated one of the largest fruit packing plants in the world in Winter Haven.

Another defining event in Winter Haven was the opening of Cypress Gardens in 1936 by Dick Pope Sr. and his wife, Julie Pope. They first got the idea for the park from a Good Housekeeping magazine that they were reading. By the 1950s, Cypress Gardens was nationally famous. It featured a beautiful botanical garden, water skiing shows, and a staff of southern belles. Many famous celebrities of that time visited the park, including Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Betty Grable, and King Hussein of Jordan. In the 1980s, the Anheuser-Busch corporation purchased the park. They continued to operate the park until 1995. After that, the park struggled, finally closing for good in 2009. On January 21, 2010, the site of Cypress Gardens was formally announced as the selected location for the Legoland Florida theme park, which opened on October 15, 2011. Legoland Florida has successfully retained some of the tradition and history of the original site, including part of the original botanical garden and a water ski show.

Winter Haven features many buildings designed by the architect Gene Leedy, one of the founders of the Sarasota School of Architecture. Regency Medical Center, which is Winter Haven Hospital&#x27;s women&#x27;s hospital, was built in 1987. Some of Leedy&#x27;s structures are part of the Downtown Winter Haven Historic District.

The Orange Dome, located near the corner of Cypress Gardens Blvd and US Hwy 17, was built in 1964. For 48 years, it hosted the annual Citrus Festival and other civic affairs. In February 2012, the Orange Dome was demolished to make way for The Landings, a proposed $150 million mixed-use development that was intended to include high-end retail stores, restaurants, hotels, apartments and a new movie theater to be built at the Chain of Lakes Complex. However, after the construction of three fast food chain stores, the project collapsed. , the developer and the city were in negotiations to determine the future of the site.

===Pughsville===
Pughsville was a neighborhood of Winter Haven where African Americans built a community after the Civil War. A historical marker on Highway 17 at Avenue O commemorates the community. According to the marker, Pughsville was one of Winter Haven&#x27;s earliest neighborhoods and was settled by African Americans who cleared the land in the southwest section of the city.

Pughsville was named for an early black pioneer, Reverend Charles Pugh, who was a founder of Zion Hill Missionary Baptist Church. Pughsville was also home to Bethel A.M.E., St. Paul Holiness, and Church of Christ. The community was most active from the 1900s until the 1950s and had an African-American school, social halls, small grocery stores, and restaurants where some residents worked. Others worked in the citrus industry or in state or federal jobs. Pughsville produced Winter Haven&#x27;s first African-American commissioner and mayor Lemuel Geathers, medical doctor, fire fighter and postal worker. The community declined in the late 1970s as larger commercial establishments began arriving in the area.

In 2011, after six years of construction and political infighting, Winter Haven opened a canal lock system connecting the two chains. Most of the lakes in Winter Haven formed in a similar fashion to sinkholes, through dissolving of the limestone ground. These types of lakes are called &quot;solution lakes&quot;. The lakes in Winter Haven teem with life, including alligators, bald eagles, great blue herons, and more. The Winter Haven lakes are a world-renowned spot for bass fishing.

With so many lakes, Winter Haven is a location for fresh water fishing. The two sports for which Winter Haven is best known are water skiing and baseball.

===Water skiing history===
Winter Haven has played a major role in the development and growth of water skiing as a sport. Dick Pope Sr. used water skiing as a way to promote his Cypress Gardens theme park starting in the 1930s, and water ski shows soon became a staple of entertainment at the park. He was also the first person to complete a jump on water skis, jumping over a wooden ramp in 1928, for a distance of . He pioneered a number of other water skiing tricks, including the water ski human pyramid, as part of an effort to develop his shows at Cypress Gardens. His son, Dick Pope Jr. popularized barefoot water skiing, bringing early pioneers such as Don Thomson to Cypress gardens to develop novel acts such as tumble turns, backwards barefooting, front to back and beach starts to please the theme park crowds.

Winter Haven is connected to 10 members of the Water Ski Hall of Fame, more than any other city in the world. These include Dick Pope Sr., Dick Pope Jr., and Ricky McCormick. George A. &quot;Banana George&quot; Blair, who still holds several water ski world records, was first introduced to the sport while visiting Winter Haven in the 1950s. Winter Haven has many lakes, including its famous chain of lakes, that are perfect for water skiing. Today, several successful ski schools, for both water skiing and barefoot skiing, make their home there. Every day, all year round, water skiers can be seen practicing their sport on the lakes around town.

===Spring training baseball===
Winter Haven was a Major League Baseball Spring Training site for many years, first at Denison Field and later at Chain of Lakes Park. Great baseball players who played spring training baseball in Winter Haven included Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, Willie Mays, Roberto Clemente, Johnny Bench, and Hank Aaron.

In 1928, the Philadelphia Phillies were the first Major League Baseball team to call Winter Haven their spring-home. The Phillies played at Denison Field, which featured a large, covered wooden grandstand. The Phillies played spring training games there until 1938. In 1940, the New York Giants did one season there. After baseball left Denison, the field was donated to the city for the benefit of youth athletics. The stadium was rebuilt in 1947 with a larger grandstand and in use today for college and high school football, soccer, track and field, and other events.

In 1966, the Boston Red Sox and spring training baseball returned to Winter Haven. The Red Sox played in the newly built Chain of Lakes Park, a state of the art facility at that time. For 26 years, the Red Sox called Winter Haven their spring-home. When the Red Sox left to Fort Myers, Florida in 1992, the city of Winter Haven sought a new Major League Baseball team. Later that year, Hurricane Andrew devastated Homestead, Florida, including the spring training facilities of the Cleveland Indians, and the Indians moved to Winter Haven. In 2008, after failed negotiations with the city to renovate Chain of Lakes Park, the Indians moved into a brand new stadium in Goodyear, Arizona after 16 springs at Chain of Lakes Park.

In December 2020, Winter Haven and Polk County agreed to demolish the stadium and replace it with baseball diamonds and general-purpose athletic fields.

<text>Interlachen is a town in Putnam County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Palatka, Florida Micropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,441 at the 2020 census, up from 1,403 at the 2010 census.

==History==

When the Florida Southern Railway came through in the 1870s, the area opened up to settlers, and the area was known as &quot;Blue Pond&quot;. The town developed economically as a winter vacation spot and citrus growing area. The Town of Interlachen was officially incorporated as a municipality in 1888. The Hastings Seed House was organized in 1889, moving to Atlanta, Georgia ten years later. In 1891, the Interlachen Town Hall burned down. Another was built to replace it the following year and it still stands—now housing a museum—and is also used as a place for presentations for certain festivals. When the Great Freeze hit in 1895, the town&#x27;s tourism and citrus sharply declined. In 1895, Interlachen Academy was built; it is the oldest wooden school house in continuous use in Florida, which now serves as the location of the Interlachen High School&#x27;s JROTC program. 

The town was named after a resident named Mr. Berkelmann from Switzerland who originally lived in Interlachen before immigrating to Florida. He suggested the name not only because of his former hometown, but because the Florida town is located between the 2 largest lakes (Lake Lagonda and Lake Chipco) in its town limits (of the more than 28 lakes in the town), and &quot;Interlachen&quot;, translates to &quot;between the lakes&quot;.

In 1926, Interlachen first gained electricity and Route 14, now Florida State Road 20, was constructed through it. In the 1930s, a train came through the town every two hours. But in 1969, with the decline of railroads, the Interlachen Railroad depot was razed. Currently, a caboose sits in the middle of the town as a reminder of the tourist haven the town once was.

<text>Palatka () is a city in and the county seat of Putnam County, Florida, United States. Palatka is the principal city of the Palatka Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is home to 72,893 residents. The Palatka micropolitan area is included in the Jacksonville—Kingsland–Palatka, FL-GA Combined Statistical Area.

The city is the location of the St. Johns River State College, St. Johns River Water Management District Headquarters, and Ravine Gardens State Park. Local festivals include the Florida Azalea Festival and the Blue Crab Festival. The population was 10,446 at the 2020 census, down from 10,558 at the 2010 census.

==History==


The area was once the domain of the Timucuan peoples, two tribes of which existed in the Palatka region under chiefs Saturiwa and Utina. They fished bass and mullet, or hunted deer, turkeys, bear and opossum. Others farmed beans, corn, melons, squash, and tobacco. However, infectious disease that came with European contact and war devastated the tribes, and they were extinct as organized peoples by the mid-18th century. Some of their survivors merged with other tribes; other Timucua evacuated with the Spanish to Cuba in 1763, when Spain ceded Florida to Great Britain in an exchange of interests after the latter&#x27;s defeat of France in the Seven Years&#x27; War.

During the late eighteenth century, Creek (Muscogee) tribes made their way to Florida. In a process of ethnogenesis, they joined with other Native Americans and the Seminole tribe emerged. They called the location &quot;Pilo-taikita&quot;, meaning &quot;crossing over&quot; or &quot;cows&#x27; crossing&quot;. Here the St. Johns River narrows and begins a shallower, winding course upstream to Lake George and Lake Monroe.

In 1767, Denys Rolle (1725–1797), an English gentleman and philanthropist, established Rollestown on the east bank of the St. Johns River, at the head of deepwater navigation. His plantation was a commercial experiment. He recruited settlers off the streets of London to serve as indentured servant/workers: they included paupers, vagrants, pickpockets and &quot;penitent prostitutes&quot;. He paid for their passage and if they survived the term of indenture, they could receive land. Some two hundred indentured servants arrived to clear wilderness for agriculture and livestock. Unaccustomed to such physical labor and a subtropical climate, however, most left. 

Next Rolle purchased enslaved Africans taken captive in West Africa. He used them as workers to tend livestock, such as chickens, hogs, goats and sheep, or cultivate and process cotton, indigo, citrus and turpentine for export to Europe.

He built a mansion and laid out a village, but trouble beleaguered his &quot;ideal society&quot;. In 1770, a disgruntled overseer sold more than 1,000 of his employer&#x27;s cattle and disappeared with the money. Rolle hired new overseers and bought more slaves, but the plantation failed to prosper. 

When Spain resumed control of Florida in 1783 for a period, Rolle abandoned the colony and chartered a ship to carry his household belongings, livestock and slaves to a estate on Great Exuma in the Bahamas. This point of land, in East Palatka, is still called Rollestown.

With the changes by different European nations in Florida, there were changes in claims in Pilo-taikita, now contracted to &quot;Pilatka&quot;. In 1774, naturalist William Bartram noted an Indian village on the west bank, but it was later abandoned. 

The current community of Palatka was traced by pioneers to a European-American settlement established here in 1821. After the United States acquired Florida in 1821, Nehemiah Brush established a ferry across the river. He bought a tract in 1826 and another of equal size the next year. The ferry landing and related site became a distribution point. A New York company shipped goods from here to supply immigrants at the Grant of Arredondo, which lay to the west.

The arrival of land-hungry European-American settlers created confrontations with the resident Seminole. When the government attempted to relocate the tribe to the west of the Mississippi as part of Indian Removal starting in 1833, the Second Seminole War began. The Seminole attacked and burned Pilatka in 1835. 

Recognizing the site&#x27;s strategic importance for control of the St. Johns River, the main artery into Central Florida, the US Army in 1838 established Fort Shannon, named for Captain Samuel Shannon. It included a garrison, supply depot and hospital. By 1842 most of the Seminole had moved to Indian Territory, and Fort Shannon was abandoned by the army in 1843. 

Settlers made use of the military piers and buildings, including eight blockhouses, to develop the town. By 1847, it was growing rapidly. In 1849, Putnam County was created, with Pilatka the county seat. With the help of Judge Isaac H. Bronson, it was incorporated as a city on January 8, 1853.

During the 1850s, Florida in general and Pilatka in particular gained a reputation as a seasonal haven for invalids and others escaping severe northern winters. Steamboats carried them up the St. John&#x27;s River in increasing numbers. One visitor wrote that amusements included &quot;sailing, fishing, rowing, walking, riding in buggies and on horseback, whist, euchre, backgammon and hunting&quot;.

The tourist trend was interrupted by the Civil War, when gunboats cruised the waters. Pilatka was destitute and largely deserted. On October 7, 1862, the USS &quot;Cimarron&quot; fired several shells over the town after seeing some Confederate cavalry. Mary Boyd pleaded with Union Commander Maxwell Woodhull to spare Pilatka, assuring him that the horse soldiers were not residents. He complied.

Among the notable residents of Pilatka during the war were Confederate spy Lola Sánchez and her sisters. Sánchez became upset when their father was falsely accused of being a Confederate spy and imprisoned by Union Army soldiers. Union officers took over their house in Palatka. On one occasion Sánchez overheard various officers’ planning a raid and alerted the Confederates forces. 

Confederate forces, led by Capt. John Jackson Dickison, surprised and captured the Union troops on the day of the supposed raid in what is known as the Battle of Horse Landing.

Following the war, the tourists returned. New accommodations were constructed including the Putnam House, built by Hubbard L. Hart, and the Larkin House, which could hold 250 guests. Steamers ran up the Ocklawaha River to Eustis, Leesburg and Silver Springs, or along the St. Johns River to Enterprise and Sanford. Industries included logging, raising cattle and hogs, and orange groves. On May 24, 1875, the post office changed the spelling to Palatka.

By the 1880s, several competing railroads crossed the community, which became an important junction. These included the Florida Southern Railroad, the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railroad, the St. Augustine and Palatka Railway, and the Georgia Southern and Florida Railroad. 

On November 7, 1884, Palatka suffered a devastating fire. When tourists arrived that season, most accommodations had been lost. They continued on trains south; this was the beginning of a gradual shift of tourism elsewhere. The city lost trade, shipping and transportation preeminence to Jacksonville, on the coast. But with its downtown rebuilt in brick to be fireproof, Palatka emerged a finer place.

In 1893, A. E. and H. S. Wilson of Saginaw, Michigan bought the Noah J. Tilghman &amp; Son sawmill, which processed cypress lumber. Renamed the Wilson Cypress Company, it expanded operations and became a major employer. At its peak, it was the second-largest cypress mill in the world. It closed in 1944, as the timber industry moved out of the area. 

The Great Freeze of 1894 and 1895 destroyed Palatka&#x27;s citrus groves for five years. Formerly they had been both a tourist attraction and important sector of the economy. The ill-fated Cross Florida Barge Canal was once intended to pass the city. Today, tourism remains important.

==Geography==
The total area is . The city is located in the southern portion of the Lower St. Johns River basin.

===Climate===

Palatka has a humid subtropical climate, Köppen climate classification Cfa. The area&#x27;s warm and humid climate is caused primarily by its proximity to the Gulf Stream, which flows off the east coast of Florida. There are two major seasons which characterize the area. One is hot and rainy, lasting from June until late September. The other is the dry season, October through May, which brings more moderate temperatures and less frequent rainfall.

==Economy==

The composition of the Palatka area economy is unreflective of Florida as a whole. Unlike many cities in the state, Palatka has a large manufacturing sector, employing 17.2% of the city&#x27;s total civilian workforce. Comparatively, Florida&#x27;s statistics indicate 5.9% of the state&#x27;s entire workforce is employed by the manufacturing sector. Georgia Pacific is the single largest private employer in the city. The Koch-owned firm employs 1,470 people at its pulp, paper, and plywood operations. PDM Bridge is another large manufacturing company operating in Palatka. Their facility is located in Barge Port on the St. Johns River. The Eau Claire, Wisconsin-based bridge builder utilizes the river for the transportation of its finished products. PDM Bridge is notable for the fabrication of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge structure.

The Palatka area was of early significance in accessing the interior of the state. This significance was due to its location at the end of an expansive portion of waterway at the divide between the upper and lower St. Johns River. First established as a trading outpost, tourism would eventually boom and fuel growth for decades. The decline of waterborne travel in Northeast Florida, and the United States in general, ultimately reduced the importance of tourism in the city. Nowadays, large international airports and bypassing interstate highways carry vacationers to destinations further south. Only 7.1% of Palatka&#x27;s labor force works in arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services, compared to Florida&#x27;s 15.5% across tourist related industries.

In recent years, the Putnam County government has adopted policies focused on facilitating Ecotourism in the region. Nature trails are being expanded and kayaking waterways have been improved and mapped. Portions of the Florida Trail runs through the area and connect local hiking trails to other trail systems in parks throughout the region. Ocala National Forest is the second largest National Forest in the state. Other large parks include Welaka State Forest, Etoniah Creek State Forest and Dunns Creek State Park. Other conservation areas exist under the management of the Putnam Land Conservancy and St. Johns River Water Management District. Both entities operate regionally and identify and protect ecologically sensitive areas. If progress continues, and ecotourism creates a vibrant local economy, economic incentives could drive further preservation of the natural habitats, benefitting the environment as a whole.

Of residents aged 16 years and over, 53.3% were in the labor force; 45.6% were employed and 7.6% unemployed. Compared to Florida&#x27;s average, Palatka has a higher percentage of unemployed. Of the same survey, the State&#x27;s unemployment was 4.6% of the available labor force. The current Florida unemployment rate, published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, stands at 7.0%. The Palatka area is bordered on all sides by four separate metropolitan statistical areas. Of those, the Deltona-Daytona Beach-Ormond Beach, Gainesville, and Jacksonville metropolitan statistical areas all had better performing unemployment statistics than Palatka in 2011, when the unemployment rate in the Palatka Micropolitan Statistical Area was 13.8%. Gainesville showed the most favorable conditions with an unemployment rate of 8.7%. Statistics for Palm Coast and Ocala both indicated unemployment rates higher than that of Palatka. Regionally, the employment numbers of Palm Coast have been hit hardest; the bedroom community has an unemployment rate currently at 16.6%.

==Arts and culture==
===Cityscape===
As with many cities in the United States, development has occurred in a radial pattern from the city center to beyond the incorporated area. Due to the historical importance of Palatka as a southeastern interior port, much of the urban development is oriented toward the riverfront. The eastern sections of the city, which include downtown and the historic districts, are characterized by a gridded street system. A significant amount of the original brick roads survive in this area. The western outlying suburban areas are primarily characterized by an amorphous road pattern.

The city of Palatka is actively working toward redevelopment of its riverfront and downtown area.

===Architecture===

Architectural styles represented in the city&#x27;s historical districts include Victorian, Colonial Revival, Art Deco, Classical Revival, and Prairie School. The James Hotel was designed by architect Henry John Klutho in 1916 in the Prairie School style. Klutho also designed the Larimer Memorial Library, named after the wife of James Ross Mellon, eldest son of Judge Thomas Mellon. The library is a fusion of Prairie School and Art Deco, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Though there are no discernible architectural styles in the outgrowth areas, a notable building technique has been used in the construction of the Children&#x27;s Reading Center Charter School. Five monolithic dome structures crown the facility and give it a distinct style.

===Library===
Historically, up to sixteen hundred people were employed at the Wilson Cypress Company mills, and a space was needed to further the education of its young working men. Funds for the first Palatka Public Library were provided by James Ross Mellon, son of Judge Thomas Mellon of Pittsburgh, who regularly wintered in Florida. Founded in 1930, the Larimer Library was gifted in commemoration of James Mellon&#x27;s wife, Rachel Larimer, and was described as a &quot;poor man&#x27;s university&quot; and &quot;the rock on which to build an enlightened citizenry.&quot; The Larimer Memorial Library contains an arts center, and the Palatka Public Library was moved to the campus of the St. Johns River Community College.

==Government==
Palatka uses the commission-manager form of municipal government, with all governmental powers resting in a legislative body called a commission. Palatka&#x27;s commission is composed of five elected commissioners, one being the mayor/commissioner. The mayor and commissioners serve four year terms. The offices are non-partisan; no candidate is allowed to declare a party affiliation. The role of the commission is to set policy, pass ordinances and resolutions, adopt regulations, and appoint city officials, including the city manager. While the mayor serves as a presiding officer of the commission, the city manager is the administrative head of the municipal government, and is responsible for the administration of all departments. The mayor is Robbi Correa.

==Education==
The main center for higher education in the city is St. Johns River State College. In 1958, the institute opened in Palatka to 191 students. The school serves Putnam, Clay, and St. Johns Counties and enrols approximately 10,000 students. The Palatka campus serves as the administrative center, it also houses the Florida School of the Arts and the local St. Leo University branch. Public primary and secondary education is operated by Putnam County Public Schools, officially known as the Putnam County School District (PCSD). According to 2007 enrollment numbers, the district is home to 12,101 students. Palatka has one public traditional high school. Palatka High School was formed in 1977 after the merger of Palatka Central High School and Palatka South High School. The Putnam County Library System serves Putnam County, Florida with five locations. The Palatka Library location operates as the systems headquarters.

==Infrastructure==
===Health care===

HCA Florida Putnam Hospital in Palatka is a 99-bed acute care facility servicing all of Putnam County, and features medical and surgical units, 24-hour emergency, critical care, diagnostic imaging, and outpatient rehabilitation.

===Transportation===
Transportation has been key in the development of Palatka since the day of its inception. Steamboats were the main economic driving force in the city&#x27;s early years. The river is no longer a primary means of passenger transportation, but remains of strategic importance in the movement of goods and services. Today, airports, railroads, and highways make up the main infrastructure of passenger travel. Palatka&#x27;s own transportation infrastructure remains important as it is centrally located between large population centers in Jacksonville, a large educational institute in Gainesville, and tourist hubs in St. Augustine and Orlando.

====Highways====
* US 17 – Primary north–south route running parallel with the St. Johns River. This route connects Palatka to Jacksonville (northbound) and Orlando (southbound).
* SR 15 – From Jacksonville to Orlando US 17 and SR 15 are the same route.
* SR 19 – Terminating into US 17, SR 19 extends into the cities major commercial corridor. The route extends further into the Ocala National Forest and becomes the Florida Black Bear Scenic Byway.
* SR 20 – Primary route connecting Gainesville and Palatka.
* SR 100 – Route connecting Keystone Heights, Palatka, and Bunnell
* SR 207 – Primary route connecting East Palatka and St. Augustine

The bundled US 17, SR 20 and SR 100 cross the Memorial Bridge over the St. Johns River toward East Palatka.

====Mass transit====
Bus transportation in the city is provided by Ride Solution. The agency is responsible for public transit throughout all of Putnam County, Florida. Established in 1986 as ARC Transit, the original paratransit services have expanded to include regular bus services, express bus services, and vanpools. Recently, bus design and manufacturing has become a way Ride Solution is helping improve community transportation. The Brevi Bus was created to handle the rugged terrain and unpaved roads of rural Putnam County. The Bus was designed locally by Ride Solution and is expected to improve access by 30 percent.

====Intercity transit====
Amtrak serves Palatka by the daily &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; and &quot;Floridian&quot; intercity rail services. The Palatka Amtrak station is a historic Atlantic Coast Line Railroad depot located at 220 North Eleventh Street. The station was added in 1988 to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

Palatka Municipal Airport is a public-use, general aviation airport located northwest of Downtown Palatka. The nearest international airport is Jacksonville International Airport, approximatively north of Palatka. The closest major international airport is Orlando International Airport.

<text>Gulf Breeze is a city in Santa Rosa County, Florida. It is located between Downtown Pensacola and Pensacola Beach, and is part of the Pensacola Metropolitan Area. The population was 6,340 at the 2020 census, up from 5,763 at the 2010 census.

Gulf Breeze is the nearest city to Pensacola Beach, and provides utility services to the island, and most of South Santa Rosa County covering over 33 square miles. The census designated places of Oriole Beach, Tiger Point, and Midway are considered to be a part of unincorporated Gulf Breeze by Santa Rosa County, and carry Gulf Breeze mailing addresses.

== History ==
The area now known as Gulf Breeze was originally settled in the mid-18th Century by the British. Gulf Breeze&#x27;s original name was Town Point. Live Oaks from the Gulf Breeze area were used for shipbuilding and blacksmiths set up ship repair shops in the town. A Confederate camp and hospital was set up in the Deer Point area of Gulf Breeze during the Civil War. 

In the late 1800s, a dry dock for ship repair was built on Deadman&#x27;s Island (now a nature preserve). The island was originally was a major ship quarantine area used by Pensacola. Deadman&#x27;s island got its name from Deadman anchors. Deadman&#x27;s Island later was host to a glue factory and fertilizer plant. 

The five year period between 1928 and 1933 saw large road development in Gulf Breeze. The first bridge between Pensacola and Gulf Breeze was built by Johnson, Drake &amp; Piper. Gulf Breeze&#x27;s first paved road was U.S. Highway 98, completed in 1933. A wooden swing bridge was established between Pensacola Beach and Gulf Breeze in 1931. The swing bridge was replaced by a concrete toll bridge in 1946, which was converted into Bob Sikes fishing pier in 1973.

The name Gulf Breeze comes from the Gulf Breeze Cottages and Store, where the area&#x27;s first post office was established in 1936. The city was incorporated on August 10, 1961 as a result of the expansion of Pensacola Bay Bridge. Gulf Breeze became famous after the 1987 Gulf Breeze UFO Incident and the Gulf Breeze Six desertions. 

==Geography==
The city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Growth of the city itself is geographically restricted, surrounded by major water bodies on three sides; the eastern portion of Gulf Breeze is occupied by the Naval Live Oaks Reservation. As a result, new growth takes place east of the city limits along U.S. Highway 98.

<text>Jay is a town in Santa Rosa County, Florida, United States. Located in the Florida Panhandle in North Florida, it is part of the Pensacola–Ferry Pass–Brent, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 524 at the 2020 census, down from 533 at the 2010 census. 

==History==
===19th century===
In 1821, Spain formally yielded possession of Spanish Florida to the United States and it became the Florida Territory in 1822. Santa Rosa County was created in 1842, three years before Florida became a state in 1845. The Town of Jay was known in the early 1800s as &quot;Cobb Old Field&quot;, but was later known as &quot;Pine Level&quot;. It is located about 38 miles north of Pensacola and 27 miles north of Milton, Florida, and about 3 miles from the Escambia County, Alabama, state line.

The Jernigan family were among some of the earliest pioneers in the &quot;Pine Level&quot; area of Santa Rosa County. Among them were such settlers as Van Jernigan, who arrived when Florida was still a territory. His homestead near the headbank at the southern bend of Cobb Creek was located on the eastern side of Milton-Pollard Road. As with many residents of the area, Jernigan&#x27;s occupation was in the timber and logging industry. He also owned one of the area&#x27;s largest range cattle herds, descendants of which continued to roam on the open range even many years after his death. Jerningan&#x27;s estate sold them sometime in the 1890s.

Eldridge Jernigan was another member of the Jernigan family who was an early settler in the area. He later moved to the nearby community of Mount Carmel.

===20th century===
In 1902, a committee was formed to select a name for the thriving farming community. James &quot;Jay&quot; Thomas Nowling submitted the name &quot;Pine Level&quot; but it was declined due to another Florida post office already using that same name. Nowling was asked to submit a second name and was turned down again due to the name being too long. He was asked to submit yet another name but the United States Postal Service decided to name the new post office after his nickname (&quot;Jay&quot;) before he was able to submit another name, and then Nowling became the first postmaster for the community that now had his namesake.

In 1922, at least 175 African-American residents of Jay left in a mass exodus after a fight between a black and a white farmer, leaving a legacy of Jay being known as a sundown town. In a 1974 &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; article, the then-mayor of Jay, J.D. Bray said: &quot;The sun doesn&#x27;t set on a colored man in Jay, ... Come 4 o&#x27;clock, they&#x27;re gone. They were run out of here back in the days of the turpentine still. And they know better than to come in here.&quot;. According to the US Census in 2010 and in 2020, the town still had only four African-American residents, but that was up from just two Black citizens on the 2000 US Census.

The Town of Jay was officially incorporated as a municipality in 1951.

<text>Milton is a city and county seat of Santa Rosa County, Florida, United States. It is located within the Pensacola metropolitan area. The city was first Incorporated in 1844, however certain areas such as East Milton, Point Baker, and Bagdad remain unincorporated. Milton is located in the geographic center of Santa Rosa County, and it is bordered by Pace to the west, and Navarre to the south. The population was 10,197 at the 2020 census.

==Etymology==
Milton was known by various names during its development. Most notable were &quot;Hell-Town&quot; (muggy, inhospitable land covered with briars, mosquitoes, thorns, snakes), &quot;Jernigan&#x27;s Landing&quot;, &quot;Scratch Ankle&quot; (due to the briars that grew along the riverbank), and &quot;Hard Scrabble&quot;.

According to Florida historian Allen Morris, &quot;Just which Milton was honored by the final name is a dispute. Some say it is a contraction of an earlier Milltown; others that it was Milton Amos, pioneer and ancestor of the present Amos family; still others that it was John Milton—not the English poet, but the Civil War governor of Florida.&quot;

==History==
Milton was settled in the early 1800s as a small village centered on the lumber industry. The settlement originally was known as Scratch Ankle because of the briars and bramble that grew in the area. Another name was Jernigan&#x27;s Landing after Benjamin Jernigan (died April 1847), who built a water-powered saw mill at what is now Locklin Lake between 1828 and 1830. Other names were Lumberton, Black Water, and Hard Scrabble, but by 1839, it was being referred to as Milltown. Milton was incorporated as a town in 1844, one year before the Territory of Florida joined the United States as the 27th state.

During the Civil War, much of Milton was burned by Confederate forces retreating from the Union capture of Pensacola on May 2–4, 1862. The Confederates intended to prevent the town&#x27;s industries from falling into Union hands. After the Southern forces evacuated, the Union troops had a small garrison in nearby Bagdad, where they had a base for expeditions in the surrounding area. Many Milton residents fled to Alabama.

In the early days of Milton, it was known as an extremely rough town. Judges from Escambia County sentenced criminals to be confined to Milton, which was nicknamed &quot;Hell Town&quot; by its residents. An old story from the area tells of the Rough Riders passing through Milton on their &quot;best behavior&quot;.

Naval Air Station Whiting Field was constructed during World War II with the help of many German prisoners of war who were housed in a camp on the site. The station was commissioned on July 16, 1943, by Rear Admiral George D. Murray and the widow of Captain Kenneth Whiting, after whom the station was named.

The first hospital care in Milton began in 1951, when a group of locals formed the Santa Rosa County Hospital Board. The first hospital in Milton, Santa Rosa Hospital, was located on Stewart Street and opened on December 2, 1952. Santa Rosa Hospital had multiple expansions in the 1960s, and by 1970, the hospital was far too small for Milton&#x27;s growing population. Construction for a new hospital began that year, and in December 1972, the Santa Rosa Medical Center was opened.

On March 31, 1962, an F3 tornado hit the northwest side of Milton, causing 17 deaths and 100 injuries. It was Florida&#x27;s deadliest tornado until February 22, 1998, when 25 people were killed in Kissimmee by another F3 tornado. It was also the deadliest tornado in 1962.

On January 21, 2025, Milton received of snow during the Gulf Coast blizzard, more than double the previous state record of that was also set in Milton in 1954.

<doc id="109745" wikidata="Q2293233" url="?curid=109745" title="Fruitville, Florida">
<text>Fruitville is a census-designated place (CDP) in Sarasota County, Florida, United States. The population was 15,484 at the 2020 census, up from 13,224 at the 2010 census. It is part of the North Port–Bradenton–Sarasota, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

The area that is Fruitville was mostly a sawgrass swamp when European pioneers began to settle the area. This marshland was home to wild cattle but, according to one source, those cattle didn&#x27;t do well due to a lack of minerals in the foliage they grazed from. This swampland was eventually drained to make the land more suitable for farming. 

In the late 1870s, a new wave of pioneers began to settle in Florida thanks to a growing orange industry. In 1876, a man by the name of Charles Reaves settled in what is now considered Fruitville. According to some sources, he was the one who named the area Fruitville after the abundance of fruit in the area. Reaves would go on to become the postmaster for the area&#x27;s 115 residents. The first church in Sarasota County was the Friendship Baptist Church. The church was chartered in 1875 and a small pine log structure was used for the congregation until a new church was erected in 1876, using some of the original lumber from the first church. In 1887, the Florida Mortgage and Investment Company of Scotland donated land to the church for the establishment of the community&#x27;s first cemetery.

Also in 1887, Charles and his wife Martha Tatum Reaves converted their corncrib into Fruitville&#x27;s first school for their three children and seven neighbors. They went on to hire Miss Josie Clower as the first teacher in the area. After citizens petitioned for a modern school building, funding was granted from the Works Progress Administration to build Fruitville Elementary in 1941. Rural schools in the nearby villages of Tatum Ridge and Old Myakka were closed, with their students bussed to the new school in Fruitville.

A map from 1902 shows Fruitville on the map as a community.

In May 1918, Franklin Field (named after then-mayor George Franklin) began operating as a military airfield during . The Franklin airfield was located north of Fruitville Road and east of what is now Tuttle road. The airfield was an auxiliary landing station for the U.S. Army Air Service and housed, at the least, several Curtiss JN &quot;Jenny&quot; planes. With the war over, the airfield saw less and less traffic and was likely unused by 1920. In 1924 the land was developed for a new subdivision.

Throughout the 1960s and 70s, there was a migrant camp called Sababo in Fruitville that supplied much of the labor force for area&#x27;s farm industry. A major crop in the area was celery. In 1966, there was an estimated 2,000 migrant workers in Sarasota County. To provide healthcare and education to this population, on December 5, 1966 the Fruitville Area Medical and Educational (FAME) Center was opened.

In November 1990, Litchfield&#x27;s Cinema 10 opened in the Sarasota Commons, the community&#x27;s first modern movie theater. As a promotion, the theater offered tickets for only 50 cents during its opening. Some of the films shown for its pre-opening weekend were &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; and .
On December 8, 2001, the Fruitville Library was opened to serve the Fruitville community as a part of the Sarasota County Library System. The library was initially called East County Library throughout its land-use planning process before the Sarasota County Commission renamed the library a month prior to its opening.

<text>Kensington Park is a census-designated place (CDP) in Sarasota County, Florida, United States. The population was 3,697 at the 2020 census, down from 3,901 at the 2010 census. It is part of the North Port–Bradenton–Sarasota, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
During the post-World War II economic boom a number of new subdivisions developed up in the area surrounding Sarasota. In 1955, the Paver Construction Company, purchased over 400 acres from Charles Schmid, a local dairy farmer. Previously, the company built the Paver Park Estates subdivision. Paver Construction was started when Martin Paver, a native of New York state, along with his wife, visited Sarasota in 1949 and liked it so much that he decided to move there and get into real estate development. He also got his two sons involved. Construction would begin in 1956 and had 1,400 homes in it when fully completed. The name of the subdivision comes from where the Pavers had lived at in Great Neck, New York.

By 1960, Kensington Park also had a 14 acre Swim &amp; Country Club that included an Olympic swimming pool, shuffleboard courts, gardens, tennis courts, picnic areas and an 8,400 square foot main building with &quot;air-conditioned clubrooms&quot;, an auditorium, and theatre stage with professional lighting/ sound equipment. By 1969, only 20% of the households in Kensington Park were paying the $100 per year membership fee, thus operating it at a loss. Even though a majority of residents presented a bill proposing a $50 per household annual fee for all Kensington Park residents to use the facilities, the Sarasota County Commission rejected the proposal. Two months later, Kensington Park offered the facility to the YMCA free of charge and it became the Kensington Park YMCA

Kensington Park was unique for being the first sustainable community to ever be built in Southwestern Florida. Another fact that would make the subdivision unique was how the utilities would work. The utilities would be in the hands of the subdivision but each person who owned property would have a share of ownership in it. Purchasing a home would help pay for its installation and maintenance. In 1958, Kensington Park started its own sewer and water system at rates lower than the City of Sarasota.

<text>Nokomis is an unincorporated town in Sarasota County and a census-designated place (CDP) along the Gulf Coast of Florida, United States, located south of Osprey and just north of Venice. The town has access to the coast through Nokomis Public Beach and Casey Key. The town&#x27;s population was 3,217 at the 2020 census, up from 3,167 at the 2010 census. It is part of the North Port–Bradenton–Sarasota, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==

The first white settlers in what is now known as Nokomis were the Knights and at least 3 other families who moved to the area in 1868. The Knights had initially raised cattle further inland during the American Civil War in an effort to avoid raids by the Union army. Following the end of hostilities, they moved closer to the shore, in the hopes that the climate of the coastal areas were better for their health. The area was initially called Horse and Chaise, which included modern day Venice. Knight donated the land for the first school and also helped build the first chapel.

In 1917, Alfred F. Wrede established the first post office with the name of Nokomis southwest of the original Venice post office. The same year, orthopedic surgeon Dr. Fred Albee purchased 112 acres from the Sarasota-Venice Company. With Ellis W. Nash, Albee created the Nokomis subdivision by subdividing the property into 130 lots, with streets radiating from two inner avenue circles and the new asphalt highway, which eventually became U.S. 41. On U.S. 41, Albee and investors built the Pollyanna Inn, a 35-room hotel.

The Florida guide, compiled in the late 1930s and first published in 1939, listed Nokomis&#x27;s population as 79 and described it as &quot;a suburb of Venice, […] separated from that town by Shackett Creek…&quot;

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the Nokomis Census Designated Place (CDP) has a total area of , of which is land and , or 15.65%, is water.

It was originally developed by General Development Corporation (GDC) as the northern Sarasota County portion of its Port Charlotte development, the other portion located in the adjacent Charlotte County. GDC dubbed the city, &quot;&quot;North Port Charlotte&quot;, and it was incorporated under that name through a special act of the Florida Legislature on June 18, 1959. By referendum in 1974, the city&#x27;s residents approved a change to its name as &quot;North Port&quot;, dropping &quot;Charlotte&quot;&quot; from its name to proclaim the city as a separate identity. It is home to the Little Salt Spring, an archaeological and paleontological site owned by the University of Miami.

Not only would they plat and sell a majority of what is now North Port, the company&#x27;s employees served on the city&#x27;s first council. The city itself was incorporated in 1959.

==Sites of interest==
Osprey is home to Historic Spanish Point, a museum and environmental complex that includes a prehistoric shell mound, a turn-of-the-century pioneer homestead museum, a citrus packing house, chapel, boatyard, gardens and nature trails. The Osprey Public Library is located at Historic Spanish Point and is part of the Sarasota County Public Library System. 

Osprey is the mailing address for Oscar Scherer State Park and the new Scherer Thaxton Preserve, two of the few protected areas maintaining habitat for the threatened Florida scrub jay. Osprey is also the location of the Blackburn Point Bridge, a one-lane bridge over the Intracoastal Waterway that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Osprey is also the site of an unsolved 1959 family massacre.

==Osprey Public Library at Historic Spanish Point==
The Osprey Public Library at Historic Spanish Point is the smallest in Sarasota County. The space is only 630 square feet and is a conversion of a schoolhouse full of rich history. The branch is the county’s first &quot;connections&quot; library, based on the King County, Washington, model, offering online access to the resources of the entire library system in a modest space (630 square feet) with sustainable operating costs.

The Osprey Library opened on November 10, 2011, and offers free Wi-Fi access, online availability of the entire library catalog, plus pick-up and drop-off service items from other libraries within the system. Some improvements were made to the original school building, such as an acoustical ceiling and panels for the wall, window treatments that buffer the sound, and carpeting. The branch is close to the main road, so these renovations offered an immediate improvement in noise reduction.

The Osprey School served the Osprey and Vamo communities from 1927 through June 1976. The land where the school resides is part of the 145-acre homestead of John and Eliza Webb, who settled in Spanish Point in 1867. When it became apparent that the community needed a new school, the land was sold to the school board for $10 on December 28, 1926, by Mabel Webb Johnson and her husband, Ernest. The school was designed by Tampa architect M. Leo Elliot. His plan for the Spanish Colonial Revival-style building recognized the importance of cross-ventilation in a hot and humid climate. The layout, with all the classrooms in a line, took advantage of cross breezes for cooling and an exterior hallway shaded classrooms from the afternoon sun. The one-story, six-classroom school initially served grades one through nine and was constructed by Becchetti and Romersa for $19,000. 

The school opened in 1927 but, like most Sarasota County schools, had to close for several months in 1933 because of a lack of revenue. During difficult economic times, parental and teacher involvement sustained Osprey School. After World War II, when the county experience renewed economic growth, the school was rewired in 1959 to allow for air conditioning and heating units. Osprey School survived without further improvement until June 1976, when it closed. Students in the area transferred to schools north or south of the community. In 1994, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The building was used as the School Board’s Teacher Education until 1989. The building remained empty until 1995 when it became the visitor center for Historic Spanish Point, and the Sarasota County library system turned a part of the schoolhouse into the Osprey Public Library in 2011.

== History ==
The area known today as Sarasota appeared on a sheepskin Spanish map from 1763 with the word over present-day Sarasota and Bradenton. The origin of the name is disputed, with some claiming that it is based on conquistador Hernando de Soto&#x27;s daughter Sara, and others claiming that it comes from &quot;sara-de-cota,&quot; meaning &quot;an area of land easily observed&quot; in the language of the Calusa indigenous tribe.

Around 1883 to 1885, The Florida Mortgage and Investment Company of Edinburgh bought 60,000 acres for development in what is now Sarasota. Many Scottish people began to arrive in Sarasota in December 1885. The municipal government of Sarasota was established when it was incorporated as a town on October 14, 1902.

Sarasota municipal government was incorporated in 1913, changing from a town type to adopting the city type of local government found in the United States and the title of its government changed to &quot;City of Sarasota&quot;. Sarasota later was designated as the county seat when Sarasota County was carved out of Manatee County in 1921 during the creation of several new counties. In 1945 the commission-manager government form was adopted for the city and it is governed by a five-person commission elected by popular vote, two members of which serve in the ceremonial positions of &quot;mayor&quot; and &quot;vice-mayor&quot;, as chosen by the commission every April. Two at-large commissioners are elected by all voters and the city is divided into three districts for which the residents of each elect one district representative to the five member commission.

Many aspects of the city are overseen by the county government ranging from the schools, the libraries, the bay, major waterways, county-designated roads, the airport, fire departments, property and &quot;ad valorem&quot; taxes, voting, the health department, extension services, stormwater control, mosquito control, the courts, and the jail.

== Arts and culture ==

===Performing arts===

Sarasota has many musical, dance, theatre, circus and other performing arts venues, including the Sarasota Ballet, Sarasota Opera, Asolo Repertory Theatre, Florida Studio Theatre, the Players Centre for Performing Arts, Westcoast Black Theatre Troupe, Urbanite Theatre, Sarasota Contemporary Dance, Sarasota Orchestra, La Musica, Jazz Club of Sarasota, Sarasota Youth Opera, Circus Arts Conservatory and many others.
Theatrical venues include Florida Studio Theatre, Asolo Repertory Theatre, Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall, The Players Theatre, Urbanite Theatre, and the Westcoast Black Theatre Troupe.

In 1925, A. B. Edwards built a theater that could be adapted for either vaudeville performances or movie screenings. Renowned stripper Sally Rand did her bubble bath and fan dance here. Tommy Dorsey, Will Rogers and Elvis Presley each performed at the Edward Theatre. It is now the Sarasota Opera House. It remains at the intersection of Pineapple Avenue and Second Street, having been restored and used for performances by the Sarasota Opera and others. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In the early 1950s, the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art purchased a historic Italian theater, the &quot;Asolo&quot; (now called the Historic Asolo Theater). This theatre was originally built for Queen Caterina of Cyprus&#x27; palace in Asolo, Italy in 1798 but was dismantled in 1931. A. Everett &quot;Chick&quot; Austin, the museum&#x27;s first director, arranged the purchase and reassembly of the theater for performances of plays and opera.

In the 1960s philanthropists Lewis and Eugenia Van Wezel enabled the city to build a performing arts hall on the bayfront. The auditorium, the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall, was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s successor firm, Taliesin Associated Architects team under the direction of William Wesley Peters. Wright&#x27;s widow, Olgivanna Lloyd Wright, who participated in the project, selected its purple color.

In 1989, Stuart Barger, a local architect, designed and oversaw the construction of another Asolo Theater, housed in the Florida State University Center for the Performing Arts. It is a multi-theater complex, located farther east on the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art property, being placed between Bay Shore Road and Tamiami Trail, and facing south toward Ringling Plaza. It was built around a rococo, historic Scottish theater previously called the Dunfermline Opera House, which had been shipped to Florida. The complex provides venues and facilities for students of Florida State University&#x27;s MFA Acting program, the FSU/Asolo Conservatory for Actor Training. This was the administrative home of the Sarasota French Film Festival for several years.

Florida Studio Theatre&#x27;s Keating Theatre, formerly the Sarasota Woman&#x27;s Club, is amongst the oldest surviving buildings in Sarasota.  Founded in 1903, the Sarasota Woman&#x27;s Club eventually set out to create a meeting place to house social events, activities, and forums. On January 1, 1915, the cornerstone was laid at the corner of Palm Avenue and Park Street (now Cocoanut). It served as the town&#x27;s first library and hosted numerous clubs and public committee gatherings. The Woman&#x27;s Club also maintained a census and birth registration, an area PTA, and a Red Cross Auxiliary.

The Sarasota Woman&#x27;s Club relocated in 1976 and the building became slated for demolition. Marian McKenna, a patron, and supporter of the arts, did not want to see the building and her memories destroyed. She purchased the building and later sold it to Florida Studio Theatre.

In 1985, the Sarasota Woman&#x27;s Club building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. After completing more renovations to the historic building in 2003, the theatre was renamed the Keating Theatre in honor of Ed and Elaine Keating, and in 2004, additional lobby space was built in the theatre - the Bea Friedman Room. FST&#x27;s Keating Theatre now seats 173 and remains a cultural center of Sarasota.

In 2003, FST purchased the Gompertz Theatre. The building was originally the Park-Seventh Movie House in the 1920s. Due to the Depression, the movie house shut its doors and became an empty venue. During its predominantly vacant period in the 1940s, the theatre hosted a variety of roadshows and performers, including Tom Mix and his Wonder Horse and the All Girls&#x27; Orchestra. During this time it was known as the Garden Theater, and later the Art Theater, before becoming known as the Palm Tree Playhouse in 1951. The Playhouse closed again in the 1960s. In the mid-1970s, Asolo Theatre purchased the space for production purposes and their Stage Two Theatre program. It was subsequently sold to Anita Katzman and reoccupied by Siesta Key Actors Theatre and Theatre Works in the 1980s. The building was acquired by Florida Studio Theatre and renamed the Gompertz Theatre in honor of Mrs. Leila Gompertz, who made the lead gift enabling the purchase.

====Music====

Sarasota is the home of the Sarasota Orchestra, which was founded by Ruth Cotton Butler in 1949 and known for years as the &quot;Florida West Coast Symphony&quot;. It holds a three-week &quot;Sarasota Music Festival&quot; that is recognized internationally and boasts it attracts renowned teachers and the finest students of chamber music.
Sarasota also boasts a symphonic chorus, Key Chorale, and professional vocal ensemble, Choral Artists of Sarasota. The Jazz Club of Sarasota is one of the largest and most active jazz clubs in the United States and has promoted jazz events in Sarasota for 39 years. 
Elvis Presley, Tommy Dorsey and Gregg Allman each played concerts in Sarasota.

Joe Perry of Aerosmith, Brian Johnson of AC/DC, Dickey Betts of the Allman Brothers Band, Donald Dunn of the Blues Brothers and Graeme Edge of the Moody Blues have all settled in Sarasota.

===Visual arts===

Sarasota and the Cultural Coast are home to fine art, film-making, circus history and performance, and decorative arts. The Sarasota Art Museum and the Ringling Museum are both in Sarasota.

==== Circus ====
One of Sarasota&#x27;s nicknames is &quot;Circus City&quot;, or alternatively &quot;The Circus Capital of the World&quot;, owing in part to John Ringling&#x27;s decision to move the winter quarters of Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus to Sarasota in 1927. The John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art houses the Circus Museum and the Tibbals Learning Center, established in 1948.

Sarasota is also home to The Circus Arts Conservatory, which is responsible for the tent show Circus Sarasota and the &quot;oldest youth circus&quot;, Sailor Circus. In 2017, The Circus Arts Conservatory took part in the Smithsonian Folk Festival.

The Showfolks Club, a social organization that also puts on an annual circus performance billed as &quot;Sarasota’s longest running circus event&quot;, is located in Sarasota.

The Circus Ring of Fame is a series of commemorative plaques in St. Armand&#x27;s Circle, honoring prominent figures in circus history, similar to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Honorees include Paul Binder, Nik Wallenda, and the King Charles Troupe, among over 150 others.

Residents of Sarasota that have been associated with the circus include daredevil and Guinness World Record holder Bello Nock, himself an honoree of the Circus Ring of Fame, as well as aerialist and circus proprietor Dolly Jacobs, who cofounded The Circus Arts Conservatory.

====Film====
In 1952, Cecil B. DeMille filmed and premiered &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; (with James Stewart, Charlton Heston, Betty Hutton) in Sarasota.

In 1998, two studio films were filmed in Sarasota: Alfonso Cuaron&#x27;s &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, with Ethan Hawke, Gwyneth Paltrow, Hank Azaria, Anne Bancroft and Robert De Niro; and Volker Schlondorff&#x27;s &quot;Palmetto&quot;, starring Woody Harrelson, Elisabeth Shue, and Gina Gershon.

&quot;Out of Time&quot; (2003), a crime drama starring Denzel Washington and Eva Mendes used the Blackburn Point Bridge, Boca Grande and Cortez. In 2013, Taylor Hackford&#x27;s action movie &quot;Parker&quot;, with Jason Statham, Jennifer Lopez, Nick Nolte had scenes filmed at Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Zan in Sarasota.

In June 2017, director Kevin Smith shot his 2022 film, &quot;KillRoy Was Here&quot;, in Sarasota.

===Aquarium, zoos and botanical gardens===
Sarasota is home to Mote Marine Laboratory, a marine rescue, research facility, an aquarium, the Marie Selby Botanical Gardens, the Sarasota Jungle Gardens and the Big Cat Habitat &amp; Gulf Coast Sanctuary.

==Festivals==
Since 1998, the city has hosted the Sarasota Film Festival annually. The festival attracts independent films from around the world. It claims to be one of Florida&#x27;s largest film festivals. In 2009 the annual Ringling International Arts Festival, held its premier and held its closing event in the historic Asolo theater, which had been moved and rebuilt again. The historic Venetian theater now is housed in the reception building for the museum where it is used for special events as well as performances, informative purposes, and another seasonal film series hosted by the museum.

Florida Studio Theatre produces the annual Sarasota Improv Festival. Founded in 2009 by Rebecca Hopkins, FST&#x27;s annual Sarasota Improv Festival brings together improvisers from across the country and worldwide. The Festival has become a destination event, drawing thousands across Florida and beyond. Past performers have come from as far as Mexico, Canada, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom to perform on Florida&#x27;s Gulf Coast.

In 2010, the Sarasota Chalk Festival that is held yearly in the historic area of Burns Square became the first international street painting festival in the United States of America. Celebrating the sixteenth-century performance art of Italian street painting, the festival hosted Maestro Madonnaro Edgar Mueller from Germany, who created the first street painting that changed images from day to night. The festival has a different theme each year and has introduced new techniques in street art. Other applications of street art such as murals and &quot;cellograff graffiti&quot; have become companion events also produced by Avenida de Colores, Inc. The murals are part of the &quot;Going Vertical&quot; project, and although it sometimes coincides with the chalk festival, it is distinct from it and often continues throughout the year. Except for a few commissioned on public property in the Palm Avenue Parking Garage, the murals are on private property and are in many sections of Sarasota and Manatee County. the Sarasota Chalk festival has relocated to Venice, south of Sarasota. The name Sarasota Chalk Festival remains the same.

It is also home to the Fabulous Arts Foundation, formerly the Harvey Milk Festival, an independent music festival in support of civil rights, focusing on the LGBTQ community. It has been celebrated in May annually since 2010 on the weekend closest to Harvey Milk&#x27;s birthday. It is currently the largest independent music festival in Sarasota, with thousands of attendees throughout the free, public, multi-day event that also includes gallery showings, film, and other live performances.

== Architecture ==
A large number of homes and buildings are designed in the Italian style. Italian architecture and culture are present in the area including at the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art. Ringling&#x27;s home, Cà d&#x27;Zan, was mostly modeled on the Venetian. Examples of those more typically seen in the same style are the residences of Edith Ringling and of Hester Ringling Lancaster Sanford, that also are among the structures in the Caples–Ringling Estates Historic District. Italian inspired statues are also common and the copy of Michelangelo&#x27;s David at the museum is used as the symbol of Sarasota. 

=== Sarasota School of Architecture ===
The Sarasota School of Architecture developed as a variant of mid-century modernist architecture. It incorporates elements of both the Bauhaus and Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s &quot;organic&quot; architecture. The style developed as an adaptation to the area&#x27;s sub-tropical climate and used newly emerging materials that were manufactured or implemented following World War II.

=== Historic buildings and sites ===
By the end of the twentieth century, many of Sarasota&#x27;s more modest historical structures were demolished. Recently, two historic buildings, the Crocker Church and the Bidwell-Wood House (the oldest remaining structure in the city), first restored by Veronica Morgan and members of the Sarasota Alliance for Historic Preservation that she founded, became city property. These structures were relocated to this park, despite protests from residents who objected to the loss of park area.

In the late 1970s, Sarasota County purchased the Terrace Hotel that Charles Ringling built and renovated it for use as a county government office building. The adjacent courthouse that he donated to the new county in 1921 has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The courthouse complex was designed by Dwight James Baum.

In the next decade, the landmark hotel built by Owen Burns, the El Vernona, which had been turned into apartments, became endangered. By then, it was called the John Ringling Towers and was purchased by a phosphate miner, Gardinier, who wanted to turn it into his corporate headquarters. Plans were made to restore the building. The city commissioners initially supported the plan, but lobbying to undermine the project began, and one of the commissioners changed her vote. The project was denied at the final hearing.

Remarkable preservation success occurred during the 1990s when the community exhibition hall, the Municipal Auditorium, designed by Thomas Reed Martin and Clarence A. Martin, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and meticulously restored to its depression recovery era, 1937 WPA community project, completion status, and its architectural glory—both inside and out. The city boasts that 100,000 people use it every year and it is a boon to the community for recreation, lawn sports, as well as being heavily attended for auctions, concerts, conventions, flea markets, galas, graduations, lectures, orchid and flower shows, and a full range of trade shows of interest to the community. Later the Federal Building, designed by George Albee Freeman (the designer of Seagate for industrialist Powell Crosley Jr.) and Louis A. Simon, which initially had served as the post office was restored as well.

Most of the luxurious historic residences from the 1920s boom period along the northern shore of Sarasota Bay also have survived. This string of homes, built on large parcels of elevated land along the widest point of the bay, is anchored by the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art at its center. 

Many significant structures from the comparatively recent &quot;Sarasota School of Architecture&quot; period of the mid-twentieth century, however, have not survived. Since they do not qualify under the age criteria set for historic preservation nominations, their historical aspect often escapes public recognition. Others frequently are threatened by demolition plans for new development without consideration of their cultural and historical importance to the community instead of motivating the implementation of plans to retain the buildings and integrate them into new plans.

In 2006, the Sarasota County School Board slated one of Paul Rudolph&#x27;s largest Sarasota projects, Riverview High School, for demolition. The board decided despite protests by many community members, including architects, historic preservationists, and urban planners. Others supported the demolition as they believed the structure was no longer functional. The issue was divisive. The World Monuments Fund included the school on its &quot;2008 Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites&quot; in the category &quot;Main Street Modern&quot;.

Following a March 2007 charrette led by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a proposal was advanced to renovate and preserve Rudolph&#x27;s buildings. The school board decided to allow a year to consider implementing the innovative plan proposed to preserve the buildings, which would include building a parking garage with playing fields above it rather than demolishing the structures. In early June 2008, the school board voted in a 3–2 decision to allow the demolition; School board members Shirley Brown, Caroline Zucker and Frank Kovatch voted against preserving the historic high school. This decision was that school would be demolished and that a parking lot would replace it. One year later, in June 2009, Riverview High School was demolished.

In December 2019, a former Sarasota High School facility was transformed into the Sarasota Art Museum of Ringling College. The 93-year-old building was renovated to include 80,000 square feet for the museum&#x27;s campus with about 15,000 square feet for exhibitions, costing about $30 million according to the president of Ringling College, Larry Thompson.

=== Other notable cultural features ===
The Sarasota neighborhood of Pinecraft is home to a relatively liberal Amish-Mennonite community which is unusual compared to other Amish communities as it consists mainly of elderly who moved to Florida because of its mild climate, of Amish people who are on holiday and of Amish who do not fit in easily in other communities. &quot;Breaking Amish: Brave New World&quot;, a television series of scripted reality is set in Pinecraft. It is a spin-off of &quot;Breaking Amish&quot;.

The Rosemary District was an African American community and is home to the Boulevard of the Arts. Newtown is predominantly and historically African American.

==== Stadiums ====
In 1937 the Municipal Auditorium-Recreation Club was built with funds provided by the Works Progress Administration, the municipal government, and local residents and business owners. It became a center for sports, entertainment, and recreation. The sports activities have ranged from badminton, basketball, boating, lawn bowling, and shuffleboard, to tennis. The auditorium hosts clubs for cards, dancing, games, gardening, and numerous hobbies as well as having become the community meeting place for commercial and educational shows and the venue for local schools and charities to hold events and dances. Tourists are attracted to exhibitions provided by local businesses as well as vendors from national circuits. This building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places because of its architecture and for providing the enormous range of community activities that are scheduled at it every week.

Sarasota is home to Ed Smith Stadium where the Baltimore Orioles have held spring training since 2010. The Orioles also have minor league facilities at the Buck O&#x27;Neil Baseball Complex at Twin Lakes Park. Previously, Ed Smith Stadium was the spring training home of the Cincinnati Reds and the minor league Sarasota Reds.

==== Golf ====

The warm climate helped the Sarasota area become a popular golf destination. John Hamilton Gillespie was an early pioneer of the game in Sarasota. The Sara Bay course in the Whitfield area was designed by golf architect Donald Ross. Bobby Jones was associated with the community course in Sarasota. Many courses dot the area, including the one originally laid out for the hotel John Ringling planned on the southern tip of Longboat Key.

==== Fishing ====
Sport fishing attracts enthusiasts to Sarasota as a result of the action that the bay offers. Tarpon was the biggest draw, but gigantic gar as well as many other species abounded to attract the notable Owen Burns and Powel Crosley.

==== Marathon ====
The Sarasota Marathon started in 2005. In 2010, declining sponsorship and marathon registration led organizers to change the event to a half marathon. The race begins and ends near the John and Mable Ringling Museum.

== Transportation ==
=== Airports ===
The major airport in the area is Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport (SRQ) which is shared by Sarasota and Manatee counties. Since being opened in 1941, it has been the area&#x27;s major airport. Before this, Lowe&#x27;s Field functioned as the main airport for the Sarasota Area from 1929 to 1941.

Five airlines offer service out of the airport to locations primarily in the United States and Canada. The airport serves more than 1,300,000 passengers per year. The airport holds full port of entry status providing U.S. Customs inspections for international travelers. St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport and Tampa International Airport are located about an hour north from Sarasota, and Southwest Florida International Airport in Ft. Myers an hour and 45 min south of Sarasota. All 3 offer a wider range of national and international flights.

=== Public transit ===
Sarasota County Area Transit has a bus service called &quot;Breeze&quot; which offers service throughout the county and also offers limited connections with Manatee County Area Transit. Sarasota County has joined the Tampa Bay Area Regional Transportation Authority to plan and build future transportation infrastructure including light rail, commuter rail and longer range bus service.

=== Rail ===
A key issue is providing Sarasota with access to the Florida High Speed Rail. The Seaboard Coast Line ran intercity train service to the city until 1971. There is no Amtrak train which stops in Sarasota, but Amtrak provides Amtrak Thruway at Sarasota Station, located approximately from the city limits of Sarasota, to the nearest Amtrak terminal in Tampa. A freight-only rail line operated by Seminole Gulf Railway does serve industries in Sarasota. The Seaboard Coast Line ran the last passenger train, the &quot;West Coast Champion,&quot; to the company&#x27;s depot on 1971.

=== Water ===
As a city located on the Gulf of Mexico, water transportation is a key consideration. The Intracoastal Waterway is a waterway providing water access to and from the Atlantic coast for tugs, barges, and leisure boats. Port Manatee and the Port of Tampa both provide nearby deep water ports. Port Manatee provides cargo service primarily while the Port of Tampa is more diverse. Port Manatee formerly even had a cruise line, &quot;Regal Cruise Line&quot; from 1993–2003. It was seized by U.S Marshals on April 18, 2003, for not being maintained. The waterway enters Sarasota Bay which provides access to downtown Sarasota at the city pier.

=== Roads ===
Because of its location on the Gulf of Mexico and its proximity to several other large metropolitan areas, road transportation is critical to the Sarasota area. The major roads in the area include:
* I-75 – the only freeway in the area, I-75 is located east from the center of Sarasota and is a major interstate leading south to Miami and north to Tampa
* U.S. 41 Tamiami Trail – a major north-south route through Sarasota enters the city from the south before heading west at the south end of U.S. 301; after briefly following Bayfront Drive the Trail heads north again paralleling the coast 
* U.S. 301 – heading north from its intersection with U.S. 41, U.S. 301 follows Washington Boulevard running parallel to U.S. 41 until the two roads merge again in Manatee County
* SR 780 – Fruitville Road (Third Street) – a main east-west thoroughfare linking U.S. 41, U.S. 301, and Interstate 75 
* SR 789 – starts out as John Ringling Causeway before heading to Bird Key and Lido Key, SR 789 turns north and becomes Gulf of Mexico Drive, a major road on the islands between Sarasota and Bradenton

==Sister cities==
The U.S. sister city program began in 1956 when President Dwight D. Eisenhower proposed a people-to-people, citizen diplomacy initiative. The Sarasota chapter was established in 1963. A sister city, county, or state relationship is a broad-based, long-term partnership between two communities in two countries. A relationship is officially recognized after the highest elected or appointed official from both communities sign off on an agreement to become sister cities.

Sarasota&#x27;s sister cities are:

* Perpignan, Pyrénées-Orientales, France (1994)
* Vladimir, Vladimir Oblast, Russia (1994) (suspended)
* Tel Mond, Central District, Israel (1999)
* Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland, UK (2001)
* Siming District, Xiamen, Fujian, China (2007)
* Mérida, Yucatán, México (2010)
===Friendship cities===
* Rapperswil-Jona, Kanton St. Gallen, Switzerland (2017)
* Busseto, Emilia-Romagna, Italy (2020)

<text>Venice is a city in Sarasota County, Florida, United States. The city includes what locals call &quot;Venice Island&quot;, a portion of the mainland that is accessed via bridges over the artificially created Intracoastal Waterway. The city is located in Southwest Florida. As of the 2020 Census, the city had a population of 25,463, up from 20,748 at the 2010 Census. Venice is part of the North Port–Bradenton–Sarasota, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The area that is now Venice was originally the home of Paleo-Indians, with evidence of their presence dating back to 8200 BCE. As thousands of years passed, and the climate changed and some of the Pleistocene animals that the Indians hunted became extinct, the descendants of the Paleo-Indians found new ways to create stone and bone weapons to cope with their changing environment. These descendants became known as the Archaic peoples. Evidence of their camps along with stone tools were discovered in parts of Venice. Over several millennia the culture and people who lived in the area changed. The peoples who the Spanish encountered when they arrived in 1500s were mound-builders. Venice lay in a boundary area between two cultures, the Tocobaga and the Calusa, and thus evidence of each can be found in the area.

The 1870s is when the area saw the first significant wave of white settlers. Venice was first known as &quot;Horse and Chaise&quot; because of a carriage-like tree formation that marked the spot for fishermen. During the 1870s, Robert Rickford Roberts established a homestead near a bay that bears his name today, Roberts Bay. Francis H. &quot;Frank&quot; Higel, originally from France, arrived in Venice in 1883 with his wife and six sons. He purchased land in the Roberts&#x27; homestead for $2,500, , to set up his own homestead. Higel established a citrus operation involving the production of several lines of canned citrus items, such as jams, pickled orange peel, lemon juice, and orange wine. Higel established a post office in 1885 with the name Eyry as a service for the community&#x27;s thirty residents. In February he was appointed as postmaster but the office was shut down months later, in November 1885, with services moving back to Osprey. In 1888, another post office was established, this time with the name &quot;Venice&quot;, a name Higel himself suggested because of its likeness to the canal city in Italy.

During the Florida land boom of the 1920s, Fred H. Albee, an orthopedic surgeon renowned for his bone-grafting operations, bought from Bertha Palmer to develop Venice. He hired John Nolen to plan the city and create a master plan for the streets. Albee sold the land to the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and retained Nolen as city planner. The first portions of the city and infrastructure were constructed in 1925–1926.

In 1926, a fire department was formed with thirty-two volunteers. In that same year, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers purchased a new American LaFrance fire engine from Moore Haven that had been damaged in the Great Miami Hurricane.

The first library was also founded in 1926 by the Venice-Nokomis Women&#x27;s Club. This &quot;library&quot; was a few books on a shelf in a local store. The library had several temporary homes until 1965 when the Venice Area Public Library was built. This building remained in use until it was demolished in 2017 due to mold. A new library was constructed in 2018 called the William H. Jervey Jr. Venice Library, named after a benefactor of the new building.

On July 1, 1926, it was officially incorporated as the &quot;Town of Venice&quot;, and soon after, on May 9, 1927, it officially became the &quot;City of Venice&quot;.

On October 9, 2024, Hurricane Milton made landfall just north of Venice, near Siesta Key, where Venice was near the ground zero of the hurricanes worst storm surge and high winds. Milton came less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene caused several feet of storm surge throughout the city of Venice.

==History==

Chuluota is pronounced &quot;Choo-lee-oh-tah&quot;, meaning &quot;Isle of Pines&quot;, &quot;Pine Island&quot;, or &quot;Land of Lakes and Pines&quot; or &quot;beautiful place&quot;, depending upon whom you ask. The pronunciation is a derivative of the Creek Indian word &quot;Chuluoto&quot;.

Chuluota was first settled soon after the Civil War. Some of the area&#x27;s first white residents were from North Carolina who came here by ox cart seeking refuge from the war, and undoubtedly encountered Seminole Indians when they arrived. They found an area teeming with fish, deer, and wild hogs. Orange groves, cattle ranches, a sawmill and turpentine production from the forests of pines were developed by settlers. A railroad provided transportation for passengers and goods.

Robert A. Mills, one of the early developers of the community, is credited with choosing the lyrical Indian name of Chuluota, which was possibly the name of the original Seminole village. &quot;Circa&quot; 1892, the name was continued by Henry Flagler, who created the Chuluota Land Company to sell land acquired by his Florida East Coast Railroad. Chuluota was originally laid out by Flagler and his Chuluota Land Company to compete with Orlando as the center of trade in the area. Following Flagler&#x27;s death, the land plats were mainly unused until the 1950s, when a post-war housing boom began to take place. The houses were generally small, and were used by working class Americans seeking affordable living.

The Chuluota School was established in 1898 as a wooden one-room schoolhouse. In 1925, a more modern elementary school was built and was closed in June 1948. This became the volunteer fire station; since 1996, it has served as the home of Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 10139 and is generally considered the community center.

Chuluota&#x27;s survival was challenged by several events. First, the Great Freeze of 1894-1895 virtually decimated the thriving citrus industry. Next, development was stalled by the bust of the Florida land boom in the 1920s and Flagler&#x27;s death, and was finally devastated by the Great Depression of the 1930s. Bit by bit, the population of the hamlet dwindled. By the 1960s, new developers made plans to revitalize the community.

It is estimated that one thousand new homes have been built in the area since 2003.

<text>Geneva is a community, census-designated place and unincorporated area in Seminole County, Florida, United States, with zip code 32732. The population was 2,913 at the 2020 Census. It is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The Little-Big Econ State Forest is located in Geneva, in which, the Big and Little Econlockhatchee Rivers are found.

==History==
John and William Bartram first documented Geneva’s history in 1765-66. Since then, there have been several other documentations: Anthropologist Daniel Britton in 1850, scientists of Harvard University in 1875 and by an Archeological Cultural Resources Study and an Architectural Resources Study.

The Geneva Cemetery is located on a piece of land that was donated by Progar Debogory. Debogory was the head of one of the Russian families that settled in the Geneva area in the 1800s. There are currently 17 U.S. Civil War soldiers buried in the Geneva Cemetery, 15 of these soldiers served in the confederacy, including Lewis Thornton Powell, a member of the Booth Conspiracy, and only 2 served in the union. There were originally 18 soldiers buried, however one soldier&#x27;s remains were removed by his family and placed in a different cemetery.

Early schools in Geneva were originally located in the homes of local residents. The first formal school was built in 1874 on land that was also donated by Progar Debogory. A new one-room school was built by 1903 in replacement of the original schoolhouse. In 1924, a new building was built out of bricks and had 4 rooms to accommodate more students. In 1941, principal W.L. Seig developed a unique 4-H program focused on the development of home economics and farming skills. This program was sponsored by Rollins College and this accomplishment is acknowledged and praised in the &quot;History of the Seminole County Public Schools&quot;. In 1988, an elementary school was built surrounding the old brick schoolhouse. The old schoolhouse was preserved for the community and in 1995 it served as a family resource center. Finally in 2008, the building was dedicated to the community to serve as a rural heritage center.

By the 1950s, NAS Sanford was being converted into a Master Jet Base for carrier-based heavy attack aircraft and, along with the re-designated Orlando Air Force Base and nearby Pinecastle AFB (later renamed McCoy AFB), saw even more military families renting or purchasing homes in and around Longwood. In 1959, the city had slightly over 1,000 residents and a city limit boundary that measured approximately square. In 1960, Longwood Elementary School was constructed and opened inside the city limits. 

During the 1950s and 1960s, the city also boasted its own airport, a single runway grass airstrip used mainly by private airplanes. Longwood Slade Airport was located on the west side of the city on the north side of State Road 434 until it was closed and developed into tract housing that became The Woodlands subdivision in the late 1960s, its entrance road being named Slade Drive.

New economic and development opportunities were brought to the area in the 1960s and 1970s, fueled by both the military and the space industry, as newly arriving Longwood residents were employed at Martin-Marietta&#x27;s new missile plant in Orlando; Naval Air Station Sanford; Orlando Air Force Base (redesignated Naval Training Center Orlando in 1969); and McCoy Air Force Base in Orlando; as well as Cape Canaveral Air Force Station; Patrick Air Force Base; and the NASA John F. Kennedy Space Center in Brevard County. The development and opening of Walt Disney World in October 1971, along with other tourist attractions and the high technology corridor of businesses, especially those engaged in the modeling, simulation and training (MS&amp;T) industry and associated military training systems activities near Florida Technological University (FTU), now the University of Central Florida (UCF), fueled even further growth. 

Short-term economic downturns caused by the closure of NAS Sanford in 1968 and McCoy AFB in 1975 were offset with other economic growth across Central Florida during the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, Longwood developed into primarily a residential community for residents working elsewhere in Seminole County or in adjacent Orange County. By 2000, the city had taken significant steps to revitalize its downtown historic district, expanded its borders through annexation and in the process gained a resident population exceeding 13,700.

<doc id="109780" wikidata="Q1813449" url="?curid=109780" title="Oviedo, Florida">
<text>Oviedo ( ) is a city in Seminole County, Florida, United States. As of 2020, the population was 40,059. It is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area. Oviedo was known for its historic houses and buildings and agriculture, as well as its population of chickens that roamed the downtown area. Although the city historically has been rural, in recent years it has had an influx of new developments to support its rapid growth, due to its proximity to the University of Central Florida and the Central Florida Research Park.

==History==
Up through the early 19th century, the area encompassing Oviedo was sparsely populated save for a few Seminoles and African-American freemen who associated with the Seminole tribe, known as Black Seminoles, in what was then Spanish Florida. The Seminole tribe had larger clusters of population in other areas of Central Florida, such as nearby Lake Jesup.

The population remained sparse until after the American Civil War, when people devastated by war started moving South to begin a new life. One mile southeast of Lake Jesup, a small group of settlers established the &quot;Lake Jesup Settlement&quot;, in 1875. Letters from that era showcased a difficult life for the Florida Cracker settlers: cooking outdoors with wood stoves, sleeping under mosquito nets, and burning rags to keep the insects away. Wildlife was plentiful, however. Initially, this settlement had around 40 families, but quickly evolved into a thriving trading post.

In the late 1870s, individuals living a few miles south of Lake Jesup needed an easily accessible post office in the Florida back country. Andrew Aulin, an early settler and shop-owner, decided to file paperwork for a post office, and in his first site location report, needed a name that was different from any other post office in Florida. Aulin liked having a Spanish name, &quot;to honor the Spanish heritage of the state,&quot; and decided to name his post office location &quot;Oviedo&quot; after the city of Oviedo in northern Spain (the capital city of the Principality of Asturias) and the University of Oviedo. Some say he visited the university, while others say he just liked the sound of it, but most agree that he likely pronounced the name rather than the anglicized . A recent campaign advocates for honoring Aulin&#x27;s original concept for the town&#x27;s moniker by using the Spanish pronunciation ).

Several people played a prominent role in establishing Oviedo&#x27;s history. George Powell was an early settler who ran a large tract of land, referred to as the &quot;Powell Settlement&quot;, which today encompasses most of the northern part of the city—including the downtown area. One of Powell&#x27;s sons, Lewis Powell (alias Lewis Payne), became infamous for being John Wilkes Booth&#x27;s primary accomplice in the plot to assassinate President Abraham Lincoln.

George Powell&#x27;s friend, Henry Foster, was instrumental in transforming Oviedo&#x27;s citrus and celery industry from obscurity to prominence by giving Oviedo reliable transportation to deliver its goods. He paid for a railway link to Oviedo and founded the Lake Jesup Steamboat Company. Agriculture was Oviedo&#x27;s primary industry all the way through the 1940s. In the 1860s, Foster also was responsible for establishing the nearby Lake Charm area as a resort to entice visitors from the North to vacation in the winter; it lasted as a resort only until the 1890s, but several winter homes built during that era still stand today. Foster encouraged settlers to begin attending regular church services on a site within the &quot;Powell Settlement&quot; that would become the First Methodist Church of Oviedo.

A citrus grower named Butler Boston also is credited for helping establish Oviedo&#x27;s citrus economy by successfully grafting tangerine budwood to grow tangerines, as well as budding the succulent temple orange from Jamaica to several Oviedo fields. Butler Boston was the son of a doctor, Alexander Atkinson, who had fathered Butler, along with several others with freed black women on his family&#x27;s plantation. Atkinson moved to Oviedo in 1871, with the 12-year-old Butler, both to set up a medical practice and buy a farm. Atkinson gave the land to his son after a freeze when he moved back to Georgia. Boston was so successful that he was hired to bud other Oviedo fields. He became a spokesman for the large black community in the area, and was especially devoted to improving their educational opportunities, and served as a local school trustee. He was also an accomplished bricklayer and oversaw the planning and construction of a new building for the Antioch Baptist Church. His legacy is noted today throughout Oviedo, in sites such as Boston Street, Boston Alley, Boston Cemetery, Boston Hill and Butler Boston Court. His home site is where Canterbury Retreat and Conference Center is located. Its centerpiece is Lake Gem, named by the Boston family for a close family member.

Andrew Duda Sr., a Slovak immigrant, established a farm in nearby Slavia in the early 20th century. He left after failing to produce successful crops, but saved up money and returned in 1926 to try again. The second time, he was extraordinarily successful and his farm survived even through the Great Depression. In fact, in 1939, he was able to build St. Luke&#x27;s Lutheran Church, which has since expanded into a large Lutheran community. The Duda family started a sod division in the 1970s, that has since flourished and continues today. The west entrance of Oviedo cuts straight through the sod farm.

Oviedo experienced a major growth spurt during the boom years of the 1920s, and new buildings and banks were built on the main street of downtown, named &quot;Broadway&quot;. Some of these buildings still remain, along with the complex of buildings surrounding the Nelson and Co. packing house, which was the center of Oviedo&#x27;s agricultural industry for decades. This agricultural complex eventually shut down for good during the 1980s, after a series of winter freezes. At that time, commercial development had already replaced agriculture as Oviedo&#x27;s main industry.

Oviedo made the transition from a rural settlement, to officially incorporating into a town in 1925, and then, officially becoming a city in 1967, through a special referendum. Five miles south of Oviedo, in 1963, residents learned about the impending building of a &quot;space university&quot; in the &quot;Orlando Morning Sentinel&quot;. Many faculty and staff members of Florida Technological University (now the University of Central Florida) moved into Oviedo, and new businesses and industry soon followed. The adjacent Central Florida Research Park, originally established in 1978, has since become the largest research park in Florida. This has resulted in an exploding population with many new developments in recent years. As the city has grown, neither feral hogs nor chickens can be seen wandering among the traffic and buildings in the town any more, leading to the destruction of the small town that originally made Oviedo so charming.

More than half the city, as well as much of the surrounding unincorporated areas, had no power for five to seven days. School was not in session county-wide for one full school week. The damages ranged from toppled oaks to destroyed homes. The worst damage was in Palm Valley, a mobile home retirement community less than a mile from UCF. Charley&#x27;s damage in Oviedo is considered to be the worst in Seminole County history. Barely a month later, hurricanes Frances and Jeanne further battered the area resulting in additional damage and power outages, but they did not reach the level of Charley&#x27;s fury.

====Tropical Storm Fay====
Tropical Storm Fay was stationary over Oviedo for days during 2008 with high winds, heavy rains, and flooded roads.

====Hurricane Ian====
Hurricane Ian caused widespread damage across Florida in 2022, and Oviedo was one of the many cities impacted. The city&#x27;s lakes and the Little Econ River flooded, and entire streets in several neighborhoods were submerged.

The nearby Oviedo Mall featured murals of historic areas along with pictures of early European and African-American settlers in the area until renovations in 2022. 

State Road 434, which cuts through downtown Oviedo, is currently being widened and several buildings have been demolished. The Oviedo Preservation Project has been tasked with photographing and documenting the buildings for posterity.

An African-American Oviedo pioneer named Mathew Powell established the Antioch Missionary Baptist Church in April 1875.

===New developments===
In 2015, the city of Oviedo dedicated a brand new downtown development just south of the current &quot;old downtown&quot; along Oviedo Boulevard. The new town center, named &quot;Oviedo on the Park&quot;, is a mixed use development with townhouses, apartment homes, restaurants, and retail. It is centered around the new Center Lake Park with a man-made lake, large amphitheater, playground and veterans tribute.

The Oviedo Mall is a single-story indoor mall with a movie theater built in 1998.

<text>Sanford is a city and the county seat of Seminole County, Florida, United States. It is located in Central Florida and its population was 61,051 as of the 2020 census. It is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Known as the &quot;Historic Waterfront Gateway City&quot;, Sanford sits on the southern shore of Lake Monroe at the head of navigation on the St. Johns River. Native Americans first settled the area thousands of years before the city was formed. The Seminoles arrived in the area in the 18th century. During the Second Seminole War in 1836, the United States Army established Camp Monroe and built a road now known as Mellonville Avenue. Sanford is about northeast of Orlando.

Sanford is home to Seminole State College of Florida and the Central Florida Zoo and Botanical Gardens. Its downtown attracts tourists with shops, restaurants, a marina, and a lakefront walking trail. The Orlando Sanford International Airport, in the heart of the town, functions as the secondary commercial airport for international and domestic carriers in the Orlando metropolitan area.

==History==

===Early history===
The Mayaca or Jororo Indians inhabited the shores of Lake Monroe at the time of European contact. By 1760, however, war and disease had decimated the tribe, which would be replaced by the Seminole Indians. Florida was acquired by the United States from Spain in 1821, but the Seminole Wars would delay settlement. In 1835, the Seminoles burned the port of Palatka on the St. Johns River, then the major artery into Central Florida from the East Coast. Consequently, an army garrison was established upstream, on the southern side of Lake Monroe near a trading post. Established as Camp Monroe in 1836, the camp was enclosed by log breastwork on three sides but open to the river, with approximately 300 men based there. The camp was attacked by Indians on February 8, 1837. It would be strengthened and renamed Fort Mellon in honor of Captain Charles Mellon, the sole American casualty.

General Zachary Taylor had a road built connecting a string of defenses from Lake Monroe to Fort Brooke (now Tampa). The town of Mellonville was founded around Fort Mellon in 1842 by Daniel Stewart. In 1845, Florida became a U.S. state. That same year, Mosquito County was renamed Orange County and the county seat was moved from Enterprise to Mellonville. Orange groves were planted, with the first fruit packing plant built in 1869. 
===Early years as Sanford===
In 1870, &quot;General&quot; Henry Shelton Sanford bought to the west of Mellonville and laid out the community of Sanford. Believing it would become a transportation hub, he called it &quot;The Gateway City to South Florida.&quot; Sanford imported two colonies of Swedes (totaling about 150 adults) as indentured servants to labor a year for their travel
expenses. The Swedes would do the back-breaking work of establishing a new town and clearing the sub-tropical wilderness in advance of creating a citrus empire, arriving by steamboat in 1871. 

Incorporated in 1877 with a population of 100, Sanford absorbed Mellonville in 1883. In April of that year, President Chester A. Arthur arrived by steamer to vacation for a week at the Sanford House, a lakeside hotel built in 1875 and expanded in 1882.

Meanwhile, Sanford was becoming a hub of rail transportation. The South Florida Railroad opened a narrow-gauge route from Sanford to Orlando in 1880, and eventually built a connection to the Port of Tampa by the end of 1883. The standard-gauge Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railroad opened a route from Sanford to Jacksonville in 1886, completing a rail link across the peninsula. The Orange Belt Railway, another narrow-gauge line, was established in 1885 and reached St. Petersburg in 1888. (All three of these railroads would become part of the Plant System in the 1890s, and the narrow-gauge lines were standardized.) Easy access to transportation soon made the area the largest shipper of oranges in the world. 

In 1887, the city suffered a devastating fire, followed the next year by a statewide epidemic of yellow fever. When the Great Freeze of 1894 and 1895 ruined the citrus industry, farmers diversified by growing vegetables as well. Celery was first planted in 1896, and because of this Sanford is nicknamed the &quot;Celery City.&quot;

On December 1, 1891, merchant William Clark and registered African American voters of Goldsboro incorporated as a town just to the southwest of Sanford.

In 1878, Mrs. Henry Sanford created the first library for public use in Sanford. A room was provided with a few books and a paid librarian. The initial library failed. In 1889, Mrs. Thrasher and Mrs. A.M. Deforest attempted to revive the library project with the aid of the Wednesday Club, the president, Mrs. Brown encouraged the women to begin fundraising efforts. The effort&#x27;s fundraising progress was slow and sporadic. A Subscription library was established in a storefront on First Street. Mrs. Duver was the librarian at this location. The library later moved to Magnolia Avenue next to the theatre at this location the library was run by volunteers. The library grew at this location, until it moved in 1914 to the Women&#x27;s Club on Oak Avenue. An official Public Library was built and opened in 1924 on 5th Street. This library was supported by the City of Sanford.

===20th century===
In 1911, the community of Sanford Heights seceded from Sanford, because of discord over municipal services provided by Sanford. This added to concerns that Sanford&#x27;s ability to expand would be constrained by the surrounding towns of Goldsboro, Georgetown and Sanford Heights, as well as Lake Monroe to the west. Florida State Representative and former Sanford mayor Forrest Lake led legislative efforts to curtail Sanford Heights&#x27; ability to incorporate as an independent entity. Goldsboro was also a target in Forrest Lake&#x27;s annexation process, prompting Goldsboro&#x27;s leaders to start a letter writing campaign to local newspapers. On April 6, 1911, the Sanford city council passed a resolution to annex Goldsboro and on April 26, 1911, the Florida legislature passed the Sanford Charter Bill, dissolving the incorporation of both Sanford and Goldsboro, and reorganizing Sanford as a city that included Goldsboro within its boundaries.

In 1913, Sanford became the county seat of Seminole County, created from Orange County. Agriculture continued to dominate the economy until 1940, when it proved cheaper to cultivate produce in frost-free South Florida.

====Naval aviation====
In 1942, Naval Air Station Sanford was established, which conducted operational training in the Lockheed PV-1 Ventura, Lockheed PBO Hudson, Grumman F4F/General Motors FM-1 Wildcat and the Grumman F6F Hellcat. At its peak in 1943–45, NAS Sanford was home to approximately 360 officers, 1500 enlisted men and 150 WAVES and included an auxiliary airfield to the east near Lake Harney known as Outlying Field Osceola. The base was inactivated and reduced to caretaker status in 1946, but was reactivated in 1950 in response to the Korean War and the Cold War. A major construction program ensued, with NAS Sanford redeveloped as a Master Jet Base for carrier-based Douglas A-3 Skywarrior and later North American A-5A and RA-5C Vigilante aircraft. At its peak in the mid-1960s, the base was home to nearly 4000 military personnel, comprising the air station personnel complement, an Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Department, the Navy Dispensary, the Marine Barracks, a Replacement Air Group/Fleet Replacement Squadron for the RA-5C, and nine deployable Fleet RA-5C squadrons that routinely deployed aboard large aircraft carriers to the Mediterranean and the Pacific. The latter were heavily engaged in combat operations during the Vietnam War.

As a result of the increasing costs of the Vietnam War and concurrent federal domestic spending related to President Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s Great Society social programs, NAS Sanford was one of several stateside military installations identified for closure by the Department of Defense in 1967. Flight operations were rapidly scaled down during 1968 as the squadrons of Reconnaissance Attack Wing ONE transferred to the former Turner AFB, renamed Naval Air Station Albany, Georgia. This resulted in a significant economic downturn for the City of Sanford and Seminole County with the departure of all military personnel and their families. The airfield was conveyed to the City of Sanford via quitclaim deed by the General Services Administration (GSA) in 1969, renamed Sanford Airport and redeveloped as a general aviation facility. Subsequently renamed Sanford Regional Airport, then Central Florida Regional Airport, the airport commenced commercial airline service in 1995 and was renamed Orlando Sanford International Airport the following year. The Navy&#x27;s presence is commemorated at the airport by two historical markers and the NAS Sanford Memorial Park, which was dedicated on Memorial Day in May 2003 and includes a restored RA-5C Vigilante on loan from the National Naval Aviation Museum that was placed on permanent static display at the entrance to the commercial airline terminal.

====Tourism====
The opening of Walt Disney World Resort in October 1971 shifted the economy of Central Florida away from agriculture, military installations, defense/aerospace industries, and the NASA crewed and uncrewed space programs, and further towards tourism, service industries and residential development, the center of which is Orlando. But because of Sanford&#x27;s former preeminence as a trade center, the city retains a significant collection of older commercial and residential architecture, on streets shaded by live oaks hung with Spanish moss. Its location on Lake Monroe and access to the navigable waterway of the St. Johns River has made it Central Florida&#x27;s additional center for numerous marinas, allowing access for pleasure boats and commercial vessels to and from the Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway via Jacksonville and Mayport to the north.

====Jackie Robinson====
Sanford Field, built in 1926, was the location where Jackie Robinson first took the field to play as a member of a racially-integrated baseball team. Robinson arrived at Daytona Beach, Florida in early 1946 for spring training with the Montreal Royals of the Class AAA International League, a minor league affiliate of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Since the Dodgers organization did not own a spring training facility, training took place at several local baseball stadiums, including Sanford Field.

Robinson&#x27;s presence on the team was controversial in racially charged Florida. He was not allowed to stay with his white teammates at the team hotel, and many other local towns prevented the team from playing while he was part of the roster. The police chief in Sanford had threatened to cancel the game there if Robinson was to play. Robinson joined his team despite the threat, but the uproar from the mainly white audience in the stands caused him to be escorted off the field and he was not able to play.

Historic Sanford Memorial Stadium was built in 1951 near the site of the old Sanford Field as the Spring Training Facility of the New York Giants. The ballpark is located just south of Lake Monroe on Mellonville Avenue, less than a mile from Historic Downtown Sanford. Other Major League stars have played in the Sanford stadiums, including Babe Ruth, Willie Mays, Tim Raines, and David Eckstein.

<text>Wekiwa Springs is a census-designated place and an unincorporated area in Seminole County, Florida, United States. The population was 23,169 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== Name ==
Wekiwa is the Creek-Seminole word for &quot;a spring&quot;. The pronunciation of a soft-&quot;w&quot;, sometimes perceived as a &quot;v&quot; or &quot;b&quot;, resulted in cartographers mislabeling maps in later years. The maps drawn in 1838 and 1849 were spelled Wekiwa.

The springs that are associated with the name of the community are spelled Wekiwa Springs and the official census uses this spelling, however, most subdivisions and streets in Seminole County use &quot;Wekiva&quot;, a variant spelling that is shared by the Wekiva River. An incorrect popular belief is that &quot;Wekiva&quot;, means &quot;flowing water&quot;, with an authentic Creek-Seminole source, but that just was an alternate spelling used by developers that has fostered differences in spellings.

== Geography ==

A small community evolved into a town, which was named for its founder in 1890. Hastings is known as the &quot;Potato Capital of Florida&quot; with of potato farms, but also produces cabbage, onions, eggplant and ornamental horticulture.

Hastings in 1910 was a thriving town that was a stop on the Florida East Coast Railway. The population of approximately 1,200 supported several general stores, a bakery, drug stores, meat markets, an ice plant and cold storage. 
In addition to farming, two companies manufactured barrels and a grist mill ground grain. 
There was a bank and a hotel, three doctors and a dentist. The town had water and sewer utilities, telephone and telegraph service. The local public school was good. Today the former FEC line is part of the Palatka-to-St. Augustine State Trail, and a trailhead can be found in the community within the Cora C. Harrison Preserve.

<doc id="109788" wikidata="Q2258177" url="?curid=109788" title="Palm Valley, Florida">
<text>Palm Valley is a census-designated place (CDP) in St. Johns County, Florida, United States. The population was 21,827 at the 2020 census, up from 20,019 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Jacksonville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Long before the first Spanish settlers arrived, there was an Indian village in what is known as Palm Valley today. Several Indian mounds have been uncovered revealing points, pottery and human skeletons. Early Franciscan missionaries constructed a mission in the area called The Nativity of Our Lady of Tolomato.

By 1703, Don Diego Espinoza had settled in what is today the Palm Valley area. His vast ranch and the surrounding territory was known as Diego Plains. In the 1730s, the ranch was fortified to protect its inhabitants from Indian attack. By 1739, Great Britain and Spain were at war and trouble was brewing for the Diego Plains settlers. British general James Oglethorpe was commissioned to harass the Spanish settlements south of the colony of Georgia, so the Spanish governor fortified the Diego farmhouse which was already being called Fort San Diego. After Oglethorpe’s failure to capture St. Augustine, the Spanish military abandoned Fort San Diego, but other inhabitants moved into the area, living off the land and the cattle.

In 1908, a canal was dug through Diego Plains connecting the San Pablo River to the north with the Tolomato River near St. Augustine to the south. This intracoastal canal made access to the valley much easier for the residents that had settled in this area. In addition to raising cattle, they farmed, logged, and sold palm fronds to religious groups. The many palm trees growing in the region led some of the settlers to decide on the name Palm Valley for their community.

Prohibition turned some of the valley residents to another source of income – moonshine. The abundant water supply and deep woods areas in the valley were ideal for the concealment of illegal whiskey distilling. The moonshine industry thrived even after the Volstead Act was repealed in 1933, but the rising price of sugar finally brought the illegal whiskey industry to an end.

Palm Valley remained a quiet area of the Beaches, between A1A and U.S. 1. There were many farms where produce and livestock were raised. The development of the Beaches has also affected Palm Valley. Today most farms in the valley have disappeared, opening the land for luxurious residences overlooking the Intracoastal Waterway.

<text>Sawgrass is a census-designated place (CDP) in St. Johns County, Florida, United States. The population was 5,385 at the 2020 census, up from 4,880 at the 2010 census. The area is located in Ponte Vedra Beach and part of the Jacksonville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. Sawgrass is home to The Players Championship (TPC), established in 1974. The tournament offers the highest prize fund of any tournament in golf.

==History==
Initial development was done by James Stockton Jr., son of a principal of Stockton, Whatley, Davin &amp; Co. one of the biggest names in mortgage banking, real estate and insurance in the southeast U.S. While on safari in Africa in 1970, he envisioned another golf course resort development like Ponte Vedra in the wild landscape along the coast. After he returned to Florida, he purchased 1,600 feet of ocean frontage near property SWD had available since the 1960s. He engaged a golf course architect and an engineering firm to draw plans for a new development that eventually encompassed 1,200 acres.

At one point Stockton had doubts about using the name, Sawgrass. The plant is common to wet, marshy, mucky ground like the Everglades and the leaves have sharp, often serrated (sawtooth-like) margins. However, when most people hear the term sawgrass, they think of Pampas grass, its first cousin.

The developer recalled that there were 140 units sold in the first year, but in 1973, with the country in turmoil, sales dropped to nine and Stockton became concerned about being successful. All the money from sales was plowed back into the development and business was difficult for a few years. Two events helped turn the situation around. First, Jacksonville began construction of J. Turner Butler Boulevard, a limited-access expressway to the Atlantic Ocean, just north of Ponte Vedra Beach. The commute time from the beaches to downtown was cut in half. Second, Paul and Jerome Fletcher agreed to sell adjoining Sawgrass to the PGA Tour for one dollar. That land became TPC Sawgrass, the first of several Tournament Players Clubs.

<doc id="109790" wikidata="Q487988" url="?curid=109790" title="St. Augustine, Florida">
<text>St. Augustine ( ; ) is a city in and the county seat of St. Johns County, Florida, United States. Located 40 miles (64 km) south of downtown Jacksonville, the city is on the Atlantic coast of northeastern Florida. Founded in 1565 by Spanish colonists, it is the oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement in what is now the contiguous United States.

St. Augustine was founded on September 8, 1565 by Spanish admiral Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, Florida&#x27;s first colonial governor. He named the settlement &quot;San Agustín&quot;, because his ships bearing settlers, troops, and supplies from Spain had first sighted land in Florida eleven days earlier on August 28, the feast day of St. Augustine. The city served as the capital of Spanish Florida for over 200 years. It became the capital of British East Florida when the colony was established in 1763 and continued as the capital when the colony was transferred to Spanish rule twenty years later in the 1783 Treaty of Versailles.

Spain ceded Florida to the United States in 1819, and St. Augustine was designated one of the two alternating capitals of the Florida Territory, the other being Pensacola, upon ratification of the Adams–Onís Treaty in 1821. The Florida National Guard made the city its headquarters that same year. The territorial government moved and made Tallahassee the permanent capital of Florida in 1824.

St. Augustine is part of Florida&#x27;s First Coast region and the Jacksonville metropolitan area. It had a population of 14,329 at the 2020 census, up from 12,975 at the 2010 census. Since the late 19th century, St. Augustine&#x27;s distinctive historical character has made the city a tourist attraction. Castillo de San Marcos, the city&#x27;s 17th-century Spanish fort, continues to attract tourists. St. George Street is a major pedestrian street that runs through the downtown area and includes over 30 historic houses and tourist attractions.

==History==

=== Early exploration ===
The first European known to have explored the coasts of Florida was the Spanish explorer and governor of Puerto Rico Juan Ponce de León, who likely ventured in 1513 as far north as the vicinity of the future St. Augustine. He named the peninsula, which he believed to be an island, and claimed it for the Spanish crown.

===Founding by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés===

Founded in 1565 by the Spanish &quot;conquistador&quot; Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, St. Augustine is the oldest continuously occupied settlement of European origin in the contiguous United States. It is the second-oldest continuously inhabited city of European origin in a United States territory, after San Juan, Puerto Rico (founded in 1521). 

In 1560, King Philip II of Spain appointed Menéndez as Captain General, and his brother Bartolomé Menéndez as Admiral, of the Fleet of the Indies. Thus Pedro Menéndez commanded the galleons of the great &quot;Armada de la Carrera&quot;, or Spanish Treasure Fleet, on their voyage from the Caribbean and Mexico to Spain, and determined the routes they followed.

In early 1564, he asked permission to go to Florida to search for &quot;La Concepcion&quot;, the &quot;galeon Capitana&quot;, or flagship, of the New Spain fleet commanded by his son, Admiral Juan Menéndez. The ship had been lost in September 1563 when a hurricane scattered the fleet as it was returning to Spain, at the latitude of Bermuda off the coast of South Carolina. The Crown repeatedly refused his request.

The Crown eventually approached Menéndez to fit out an expedition to Florida on the condition that he explore and settle the region as King Philip&#x27;s &quot;adelantado&quot;, and eliminate the Huguenot French, whom the Catholic Spanish considered to be dangerous heretics.

Menéndez was in a race to reach Florida before the French captain Jean Ribault, who was on a mission to secure Fort Caroline. On August 28, 1565, the feast day of St. Augustine of Hippo, Menéndez&#x27;s crew finally sighted land; the Spaniards continued sailing northward along the coast from their landfall, investigating every inlet and plume of smoke along the shore. On September 4, they encountered four French vessels anchored at the mouth of a large river (the St. Johns), including Ribault&#x27;s flagship, &quot;La Trinité&quot;. The two fleets met in a brief skirmish, but it was not decisive. Menéndez sailed southward and landed again on September 8, formally declared possession of the land in the name of Philip II, and officially founded the settlement he named &quot;San Agustín&quot; (Saint Augustine). Father Francisco López de Mendoza Grajales, the chaplain of the expedition, celebrated the first Thanksgiving Mass on the grounds. The formal Franciscan outpost, Mission Nombre de Dios, was founded at the landing point, perhaps the first mission in what would become the continental United States. 
The mission served nearby villages of the Mocama, a Timucua group, and was at the center of an important chiefdom in the late 16th and 17th century. The settlement was built in the former Timucua village of Seloy; this site was chosen for its strategic location facing the waterways of St. Augustine bay with their abundant resources, an eminently suitable site for water communications and defense.
A French attack on St. Augustine was thwarted by a violent squall that ravaged the French naval forces. Taking advantage of this, Menéndez marched his troops overland to Fort Caroline on the St. Johns River, about north. The Spanish easily overwhelmed the lightly defended French garrison, which had been left with only a skeleton crew of 20 soldiers and about 100 others, killing most of the men and sparing about 60 women and children. The bodies of the victims were hung in trees with the inscription: &quot;Hanged, not as Frenchmen, but as &quot;Lutherans&quot; (heretics)&quot;. Menéndez renamed the fort &quot;San Mateo&quot; and marched back to St. Augustine, where he discovered that the shipwrecked survivors from the French ships had come ashore to the south of the settlement. A Spanish patrol encountered the remnants of the French force, and took them prisoner. Menéndez accepted their surrender, but then executed all of them except a few professing Catholics and some Protestant workers with useful skills, at what is now known as Matanzas Inlet (&quot;Matanzas&quot; is Spanish for &quot;slaughters&quot;). The site is very near the national monument Fort Matanzas, built in 1740–1742 by the Spanish.

===Invasions by pirates and enemies of Spain===
Succeeding governors of the province maintained a peaceful coexistence with the local Native Americans, allowing the isolated outpost of St. Augustine some stability for a few years. On May 28 and 29, 1586, soon after the Anglo-Spanish War began between England and Spain, the English privateer Sir Francis Drake sacked and burned St. Augustine. The approach of his large fleet obliged Governor Pedro Menéndez Márquez and the townspeople to evacuate the settlement. When the English got ashore, they seized some artillery pieces and a royal strongbox containing gold ducats (which was the garrison payroll). The killing of their sergeant major by the Spanish rearguard caused Drake to order the town razed to the ground.

In 1609 and 1611, expeditions were sent out from St. Augustine against the English colony at Jamestown. In the second half of the 17th century, groups of Indians from the colony of Carolina conducted raids into Florida and killed the Franciscan priests who served at the Catholic missions. Requests by successive governors of the province to strengthen the presidio&#x27;s garrison and fortifications were ignored by the Spanish Crown which had other priorities in its vast empire. The charter of 1663 for the new Province of Carolina, issued by King Charles II of England, was revised in 1665, claiming lands as far southward as 29 degrees north latitude, about 65 miles south of the existing settlement at St. Augustine.

The English buccaneer Robert Searle sacked St. Augustine in 1668, after capturing some Spanish supply vessels bound for the settlement and holding their crews at gun point while his men hid below decks. Searle was retaliating for the Spanish destruction of the settlement of New Providence in the Bahamas. Searle and his men killed sixty people and pillaged public storehouses, churches and houses. This raid and the establishment of the English settlement at Charles Town spurred the Spanish Crown to finally acknowledge the vulnerability of St. Augustine to foreign incursions and strengthen the city&#x27;s defenses. In 1669, Queen Regent Mariana ordered the Viceroy of New Spain to disburse funds for the construction of a permanent masonry fortress, which began in 1672. Before the fortress was completed, French buccaneers Michel de Grammont and Nicolas Brigaut planned an ill-fated attack in 1686 which was foiled: their ships were run aground, Grammont and his crew were lost at sea, and Brigaut was captured ashore by Spanish soldiers. The Castillo de San Marcos was completed in 1695, not long before an attack by James Moore&#x27;s forces from Carolina in November, 1702. Failing to capture the fort after a siege of 58 days, the British set St. Augustine ablaze as they retreated.

In 1738, the governor of Spanish Florida, Manuel de Montiano, ordered a settlement be constructed two miles north of St. Augustine for the growing Free Black community established by fugitive slaves who had escaped into Florida from the Thirteen Colonies. This new community, Fort Mose, would serve as a military outpost and buffer for St. Augustine, as the men accepted into Fort Mose had enlisted in the colonial militia and converted to Catholicism in exchange for their freedom.

In 1740, however, St. Augustine was again besieged, this time by the governor of the British colony of Georgia, General James Oglethorpe, who was also unable to take the fort.

===Loyalist haven under British rule===
The 1763 Treaty of Paris, signed after Great Britain&#x27;s victory over France and Spain during the Seven Years&#x27; War, ceded Florida to Great Britain in exchange for the return of Havana and Manila. The vast majority of Spanish colonists in the region left Florida for Cuba, Florida became Great Britain&#x27;s fourteenth and fifteenth North American colonies, and because of the political sympathies of its British inhabitants, St. Augustine became a Loyalist haven during the American Revolutionary War.

After the mass exodus of St. Augustinians, Great Britain sought to repopulate its new colony. The London Board of Trade advertised 20,000-acre lots to any group that would settle in Florida within ten years, with one resident per 100 acres. Pioneers who were &quot;energetic and of good character&quot; were given 100 acres of land and 50 additional acres for each family member they brought. Under Governor James Grant, almost three million acres of land were granted in East Florida alone. Second stories were added to existing Spanish homes and new houses were built. Cattle ranching and plantation agriculture began to thrive.

During the twenty-year period of British rule, Britain took command of both the Castillo de San Marcos (renamed Fort St. Mark) and of Fort Matanzas. They permanently stationed a small group of men at Fort Matanzas. Once war broke out, loyalist St. Augustine residents burned effigies of Patriots Samuel Adams and John Hancock in the plaza. Fort St. Mark became a training and supply base, as well as a prisoner-of-war camp where three signers of the Declaration of Independence and South Carolina&#x27;s lieutenant governor Christopher Gadsden were held. Local militias composed of Florida, Georgia, and Carolina inhabitants formed the East Florida Rangers in 1776 and were reorganized to form the King&#x27;s Rangers in 1779. Spanish General Bernardo de Gálvez, harassed the British in West Florida and captured Pensacola. Fears that the Spanish would then move to capture St. Augustine, however, proved unfounded.

The 1783 Treaty of Paris, which recognized the independence of the Thirteen Colonies as the United States, ceded Florida back to Spain and returned the Bahamas to Britain. As a result, some of the town&#x27;s Spanish residents returned to St Augustine. Refugees from Dr. Andrew Turnbull&#x27;s troubled colony in New Smyrna had fled to St. Augustine in 1777, made up the majority of the city&#x27;s population during the period of British rule, and remained when the Spanish Crown took control again. This group was, and still is, referred to locally as &quot;Menorcans&quot;, even though it also included settlers from Italy, Corsica and the Greek islands.

===Second Spanish period===
During the Second Spanish period (1784–1821) of Florida, Spain was dealing with invasions of the Iberian peninsula by Napoleon&#x27;s armies in the Peninsular War, and struggled to maintain a tenuous hold on its territories in the western hemisphere as revolution swept South America. The royal administration of Florida was neglected, as the province had long been regarded as an unprofitable backwater by the Crown. The United States, however, considered Florida vital to its political and military interests as it expanded its territory in North America, and maneuvered by sometimes clandestine means to acquire it. On October 5, 1811, a hurricane hit St. Augustine that caused extensive damage to the city. The damage was further exacerbated by the economic situation of Spanish Florida. The Adams–Onís Treaty, negotiated in 1819 and ratified in 1821, ceded Florida and St. Augustine, still its capital at the time, to the United States.

===Territory of Florida===

According to the Adams–Onís Treaty, the United States acquired East Florida and absolved Spain of $5 million of debt. Spain renounced all claims to West Florida and the Oregon Country. Andrew Jackson returned to Florida in 1821, upon ratification of the treaty, and established a new territorial government. Americans from older plantation societies of Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas began to move to the area. West Florida was quickly consolidated with East and the new capital of Florida became Tallahassee, halfway between the old capitals of St. Augustine and Pensacola, in 1824.

Once many Americans had begun to immigrate to the new territory, it became apparent that there would be continued skirmishes with local Creek and Miccosukee peoples and white settlers encroaching on their land. The United States government favored removal policies, but local indigenous groups in Florida refused to leave without fighting. The nineteenth century saw three Seminole Wars. In 1823, territorial governor William Duval and James Gadsden signed the Treaty of Moultrie Creek, forcing Seminoles onto a four million acre reservation in central Florida. The Second Seminole War (1835–1842) was the longest war of Indian removal and resulted when the United States government attempted to move the Seminole people from Central Florida to a Creek reservation west of the Mississippi River. As a result of the Seminole War, Seminole prisoners, including the prominent leader Osceola, were held captive in the Castillo de San Marcos, renamed Fort Marion after General Francis Marion, who fought in the American Revolution, in the 1830s.

By 1840, the territory&#x27;s population had reached 54,477 people. Half the population were enslaved Africans. Steamboats were popular on the Apalachicola and St. Johns Rivers, and there were several plans for railroad construction. The territory south of present-day Gainesville was sparsely populated by whites.

In 1845 the Florida Territory was admitted into the Union as the State of Florida.

===Civil War===
On January 7, 1861, only three days before Florida would secede and join the Confederacy, a group of 125 Florida militia marched on Fort Marion. The fort was guarded by a single sergeant, who surrendered the fort after being provided with a receipt. Gen. Robert E. Lee, who was commander of coastal defenses at the time, ordered that the fort&#x27;s cannons be removed and sent to more strategic locations, such as Fernandina and the mouth of the St. Johns River.

The town raised a Confederate militia unit, known as the Florida Independent Blues or the Saint Augustine Blues. They were soon joined by the Milton Guard, another militia unit.

In an effort to help blockade runners avoid capture, the Confederate government ordered all lighthouses to be extinguished. In St. Augustine, the customhouse officer, Paul Arnau, organized the &quot;Coastal Guard&quot;, a group who worked to disable the lighthouses along Florida&#x27;s east coast. They started by removing and hiding the lenses from the St. Augustine Light before moving south. After successfully dismantling the lighthouses at Cape Canaveral, Jupiter Inlet, and Key Biscayne, Arnau returned to St. Augustine. He would then serve as mayor from 1861 until early 1862, just before the Federals took over the city.

The Confederate authorities remained in control of St. Augustine for fourteen months, although it was barely defended. The Union conducted a blockade of shipping. In 1862 Union troops gained control of St. Augustine and controlled it through the rest of the war. With the economy already suffering, many residents fled.

===Henry Flagler and the railroad===

Henry Flagler, a co-founder with John D. Rockefeller of the Standard Oil Company, spent the winter of 1883 in St. Augustine and found the city charming, but considered its hotels and transportation systems inadequate. He had the idea to make St. Augustine a winter resort for wealthy Americans from the north, and to bring them south he bought several short line railroads and combined these in 1885 to form the Florida East Coast Railway. He built a railroad bridge over the St. Johns River in 1888, opening up the Atlantic coast of Florida to development.

Flagler finished construction in 1887 on two large ornate hotels in the city, the 450-room Hotel Ponce de Leon and the 250-room Hotel Alcazar. The next year, he purchased the Casa Monica Hotel (renaming it the Cordova Hotel) across the street from both the Alcazar and the Ponce de Leon. His chosen architectural firm, Carrère and Hastings, radically altered the appearance of St. Augustine with these hotels, giving it a skyline and beginning an architectural trend in the state characterized by the use of the Spanish Renaissance Revival and Moorish Revival styles. With the opening of the Ponce de Leon in 1888, St. Augustine became the winter resort of American high society for a few years.

When Flagler&#x27;s Florida East Coast Railroad was extended southward to Palm Beach and then Miami in the early 20th century, the wealthy stopped in St. Augustine en route to the southern resorts. Wealthy vacationers began to customarily spend their winters in South Florida, where the climate was warmer and freezes were rare. St. Augustine nevertheless still attracted tourists, and eventually became a destination for families traveling in automobiles as new highways were built and Americans took to the road for annual summer vacations. The tourist industry soon became the dominant sector of the local economy.

===Civil Rights Movement===

In 1963, nearly a decade after the Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; that segregation of schools was unconstitutional, African Americans were still trying to get St. Augustine to integrate the public schools in the city. They were also trying to integrate public accommodations, such as lunch counters, and were met with arrests and Ku Klux Klan violence. Local students held protests throughout the city, including sit-ins at the local Woolworth&#x27;s, picket lines, and marches through the downtown. These protests were often met with police violence. Homes of African Americans were firebombed, black leaders were assaulted and threatened with death, and others were fired from their jobs.

In the spring of 1964, St. Augustine civil rights leader Robert Hayling asked the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and its leader Martin Luther King Jr. for assistance. From May until July 1964, King and Hayling, along with Hosea Williams, C. T. Vivian, Dorothy Cotton, Andrew Young and others, organized marches, sit-ins, pray-ins, wade-ins and other forms of protest in St. Augustine. Hundreds of black and white civil rights supporters were arrested, and the jails were filled to capacity. At the request of Hayling and King, civil rights supporters from elsewhere, including students, clergy, activists and well-known public figures, came to St. Augustine and were arrested together.

St. Augustine was the only place in Florida where King was arrested; his arrest there occurred on June 11, 1964, on the steps of the Monson Motor Lodge&#x27;s restaurant. The demonstrations came to a climax when a group of black and white protesters jumped into the hotel&#x27;s segregated swimming pool. In response to the protest, James Brock, the manager of the hotel and the president of the Florida Hotel &amp; Motel Association, poured muriatic acid into the pool to scare the protesters. Photographs of this, and of a policeman jumping into the pool to arrest the protesters, were broadcast around the world. One appeared on the front page of the Washington paper the day the senate went to vote on the passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. It became the most famous photograph ever taken in St. Augustine.

The Ku Klux Klan and its supporters responded to these protests with violent attacks that were widely reported in national and international media. Popular revulsion against the Klan and police violence in St. Augustine generated national sympathy for the black protesters and became a key factor in Congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, leading eventually to passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, both of which provided federal enforcement of constitutional rights.

St. Augustine&#x27;s historically Black college, now Florida Memorial University, felt itself unwelcome in St. Augustine, and departed in 1968 for a new campus near Opa-locka in Dade County. It is currently located in the Opa-locka North neighborhood of Miami Gardens, next to St. Thomas University.

===Modern St. Augustine===
In 1965, St. Augustine celebrated the 400th anniversary of its founding, and jointly with the State of Florida, inaugurated a program to restore part of the colonial city. The Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board was formed to reconstruct more than thirty-six buildings to their historical appearance, which was completed within a few years. When the State of Florida abolished the Board in 1997, the City of St. Augustine assumed control of the reconstructed buildings, as well as other historic properties including the Government House. In 2010, the city transferred control of the historic buildings to UF Historic St. Augustine, Inc., a direct support organization of the University of Florida.

Cross and Sword was a 1965 play by American playwright Paul Green created to honor the 400th anniversary of the settlement of St. Augustine. It was Florida&#x27;s official state play, having received the designation by the Florida Senate in 1973. It was performed for ten weeks every summer in St. Augustine for more than 30 years, closing in 1996.
In 2015, St. Augustine celebrated the 450th anniversary of its founding with a four-day long festival and a visit from Felipe VI of Spain and Queen Letizia of Spain.

On October 7, 2016 Hurricane Matthew caused widespread flooding in downtown St. Augustine.

St. Augustine averages 4.6 frosts per year. The record low of happened on January 21, 1985. Hurricanes occasionally impact the region; however, like most areas prone to such storms, St. Augustine rarely suffers a direct hit by a major hurricane. The last direct hit by a major hurricane to the city was Hurricane Dora in 1964. Extensive flooding occurred in the downtown area of St. Augustine when Hurricane Matthew passed east of the city in October 2016.

==Education==
Primary and secondary education in St. Augustine is overseen by the St. Johns County School District.

There are four zoned elementary schools with sections of the city limits in their attendance boundaries: John A. Crookshank (outside the city limits), R. B. Hunt, Ketterlinus, and Osceola (outside the city limits). 
There are two zoned middle schools (both outside the city limits): R. J. Murray Middle School, and Sebastian Middle School. There are no county high schools located within St. Augustine&#x27;s current city limits, but St. Augustine High School is the designated senior high school for residentially-zoned land in St. Augustine. Additionally Pedro Menendez High School, and St. Johns Technical High School are located in the vicinity.

The Florida School for the Deaf and Blind, a state-operated boarding school for deaf and blind students, was founded in the city in 1885. The Catholic Diocese of St. Augustine operates the St. Joseph Academy, Florida&#x27;s oldest Catholic high school, to the west of the city.

There are several institutions of higher education in and around St. Augustine. Flagler College is a four-year liberal arts college founded in 1968. It is located in the former Ponce de Leon Hotel in downtown St. Augustine. St. Johns River State College, a state college in the Florida College System, has its St. Augustine campus just west of the city. Also in the area are the University of North Florida, Jacksonville University, and Florida State College at Jacksonville in Jacksonville.

The institution now known as Florida Memorial University was located in St. Augustine from 1918 to 1968, when it relocated to its present campus in Miami Gardens. Originally known as Florida Baptist Academy, then Florida Normal, and then Florida Memorial College, it was a historically black institution and had a wide impact on St. Augustine while it was located there. During World War II it was chosen as the site for training the first blacks in the U. S. Signal Corps. Among its faculty members was Zora Neale Hurston; a historic marker was placed in 2003 at the house at 791 West King Street where she lived while teaching at Florida Memorial (and where she completed her autobiography &quot;Dust Tracks on a Road&quot;.)
