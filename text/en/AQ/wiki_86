Willson suggested &quot;Hamilton County&quot; after William W. Hamilton, the president of the State Senate. He helped pass the legislation. The law took effect on January 1, 1857, renaming Webster City and designating it as the county seat of the newly organized Hamilton County.

<text>Kanawha is a city in Hancock County, Iowa, United States. The population was 658 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==

Kanawha was platted in 1899. The newly constructed railroad had arrived from Belmond, Iowa. Business&#x27; and some buildings moved from settlements three to four miles distant to establish in the new town on the railroad. Those settlements were Cuba, to the north, Magor, to the northwest, Mikesville, to the southwest, Aldrich, to the south (Drew, moved and renamed Bruce, was farther south), West Lake, to the east, and Bailey&#x27;s Grove to the north east. Kanawha&#x27;s founder, George Casper Call, petitioned Congressman J.P. Dolliver requesting a post office and proposing the name &quot;Luzon&quot;. Luzon was rejected because it was thought to be too close to the name of an existing Iowa, Luzerne in Benton County. Faced with having to find another name, a railroad engineer and West Virginia native, suggested &quot;Kanawha&quot;. The name met with approval.

<text>Missouri Valley is a city in Harrison County, Iowa, United States. The population was 2,678 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Originally, Missouri Valley was known as St. John&#x27;s (Findley or Old St. Johns), and established in 1856. This settlement was founded at the intersection of the Chicago &amp; Northwestern, Sioux City &amp; Pacific, and the Fremont, Elkhorn &amp; Missouri Valley lines. Following the collapse of wild cat banks in 1858 and the near completion of the railroad, the town was moved 2 miles from its original location and renamed &quot;New St. Johns&quot;. The town was formally renamed a second time soon after, this time being named after the valley of the Missouri River.

Missouri Valley was formally laid out in 1867 when the Chicago and North Western Railway was extended to that point. Missouri Valley was a true railroad town in the late 1800s.

<text>Mount Pleasant is a city in and the county seat of Henry County in the U.S. state of Iowa. The population was 9,274 in the 2020 census, an increase from 8,668 in the 2010 census. It was founded in 1835 by pioneer Presley Saunders.

== History ==

The first permanent settlement at Mount Pleasant was made in 1833. Mount Pleasant was incorporated as a town in 1842, and again in 1851.

In 1869, Mount Pleasant was the site of a solar eclipse expedition, under the command of James Craig Watson and sponsored by &quot;National Almanac.&quot; The total solar eclipse occurred on August 7, 1869.

In the Union Block building in 1869, Arabella A. Mansfield became the first woman in the United States to be awarded a license to practice law. She had passed the bar exam with high scores and won a court case for entry to the bar. The legislature changed its statute.

The third floor of the Union Block housed the Opera House or Union Hall, a gathering place for the community. It attracted national speakers on tour, including abolitionists Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, and Anna Dickinson. James Harlan also spoke there, as he was president of Iowa Wesleyan College in the town, and later was elected several times to the United States Senate. This building had been considered one of the most endangered historic sites in Iowa.

The Mount Pleasant Mental Health Institute was built in 1861. However, in 1936, a fire did great damage to the original building. Beginning in 1976, many of the hospital facilities were transferred to the Mount Pleasant Correctional Facility, which still occupies the campus. The hospital itself was closed in 2015.

On December 10, 1986, Ralph Orin Davis, a resident, walked into a city council meeting and shot Mayor Edward King and two council members. Mayor King died of his wounds after being shot point blank in the head. The 69-year-old gunman had attended a couple of previous meetings, complaining about a backed-up sewer and wanting the city to pay for damages to his house. The two council members were seriously wounded. Tom Vilsack became the replacement mayor, later serving as Governor of Iowa for 8 years, and then Secretary of Agriculture under the Obama and Biden administrations.

<text>Salem is a city in Henry County, Iowa, United States. The population was 394 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Salem was settled originally by Quakers with the intent that it be a community of Friends. In 1835 Aaron Street, while wending his way westward, came upon an uninhabited spot and declared &quot;Now have mine eyes beheld a country teeming with every good thing…Hither will I come with my flocks and my herds, with my children and my children&#x27;s children, and our city shall be called Salem, for thus was the city of our fathers, even near unto the seacoast.&quot; Independently another Quaker, Isaac Pigeon, who may have visited the spot before Street, brought his family to the area. They became the first citizens of Salem, and with Peter Boyer, began to recruit other Quakers to migrate westward to join them. As early as 1837, Friends meetings were held in private homes, and after the village was laid out in 1839 by Aaron Street Jr., and Peter Boyer, a meeting house was built. From the early years members of other Christian denominations settled in Salem, so it was never an exclusively Quaker community.

Being only twenty miles from the Missouri border, Salem became an important depot on the Underground Railroad. A prominent member of the abolitionists was Henderson Lewelling. His house on West Main St. is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as an Underground Railroad station. The Friends, however, had a dispute over the issue of abolition. Agreed in their opposition to slavery, they disagreed on actively helping slaves escape. In 1846, 50 members of the community, including Lewelling, were disfellowshiped. In 1847, the Lewelling family traveled by covered wagon along the Oregon Trail along with a special covered wagon that had been designed to transport more than 700 young fruit and nut trees, apples, pears, peaches, cherries, quince, walnut, and hickory. The surviving trees became the parent stock of all of the early orchards in the Pacific Northwest.

The Society of Friends also established a college in Salem. Whittier College, unrelated to the college of the same name in California, existed from 1868 to 1910.

<text>Wayland is a village in Jefferson Township, Henry County, Iowa, United States. The population was 964 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==

Wayland was originally known as Crooked Creek. Crooked Creek became a voting precinct on October 5, 1840. The first burial is given to John Bullock, in 1838. He came as a surveyor to this region in 1837. The need to establish a post office followed. Rufus M. Pickell, one of the local leaders, was appointed on February 3, 1843, postmaster for the land east of the Skunk River and south of Crooked Creek. Pickell was also a blacksmith by trade. Establishing a church followed, so the little log cabin Methodist Church was built in 1844. From 1851 to 1880, the town was known as Marshall. Christian Roth Sr. erected a brewery on his homestead in 1856, which was completed at a cost of over $4,000. Until its closing by laws passed in 1884, it had done a prosperous business and had a capacity of 10 barrels a day. Confusion over the name Marshall, Henry County and Marshalltown, Iowa, especially with mail getting mixed, required a change in 1879, with the smaller town relinquishing its name and taking up a new one in 1880. In the 1879 Henry County History book the following names can be found in Jefferson Township: Burrows, Clifton, Cook, Davies, Everts, Farmer, Hull, Jessup, Johnson, Manning, Mathews, Moore, Noble, Ressel, Sayles, Shively, Turney, Walker, Wallbank, Wiggins, and Williams.

<text>Winfield is a city in Henry County, Iowa, United States. The population was 1,033 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Winfield was laid out in 1852. It experienced a growth with the arrival of the Burlington and Northwestern Railway in late 1876, connecting the town with Burlington. The line was extended along the east side of town and reached Washington at the start of 1880, and in 1881, the Burlington and Western Railway was incorporated to build a line from Winfield to Oskaloosa. The new line branched from the Burlington and Northwestern just north of town reached Coppock the spring of 1882 and Oskaloosa in late 1883. These were 3 ft gauge railways.

In 1882, the Chicago, Burlington and Pacific constructed a rail line west from a railroad ferry crossing of the Mississippi River at Oakville, Iowa to Oskaloosa. This line passed Winfield along the south border of Winfield, and it largely paralleled the Burlington and Western to Oskaloosa, Iowa. The line was sold to the Central Iowa Railway as soon as it was built, and that line became the Iowa Central Railway a few years later.

Winfield was the hometown of the sports reporter Bill Bryson Sr.

==Education==

Notre Dame Catholic School in Cresco and Trinity Catholic school in Protivin offer private education to elementary students. There was previously a Notre Dame High School in Cresco. Its final class graduated in 1989.

=== Governance and expansion (1871–1880) ===
The school board&#x27;s earliest documented minutes date to December 1871. Among the board&#x27;s initial members were Augustus Beadle, Edward Gillette, W. R. Mead, S. A. Stone, and W. H. Patterson. During this period bonds were issued and subsequently sold for cash, providing the financial resources to expand the school building with the addition of the west wing.

The next year brought changes in both the composition and governance of the board. In January 1872, the board welcomed new members D. W. Owe and Charles I. White. A series of appointments took place in March of that same year, with Beadle assuming the role of president, John E. Peck appointed treasurer, and White taking on the position of secretary.

During the course of 1872, the board undertook initiatives to further enhance the educational facilities. An allocation of $400 was approved for the acquisition of four lots adjacent to the schoolhouse, aiming to provide ample space for future development. Additionally, a tax levy of 10 mills on the dollar was introduced to contribute to the school house fund.

=== Growth and expansion (1878–1896) ===
In 1878, an east wing was added to the building. The project was completed by 1880, with a total estimated cost of $13,000. Cresco High School&#x27;s inaugural commencement ceremony took place on June 18, 1880, in Lyric Hall. The principal, L. T. Weld, delivered an address to the graduating class of six students. Although historical records from this period are somewhat limited, it is known that the high school offered a three-year course of study at the time. The curriculum was expanded to a four-year program in 1901.

The physical infrastructure of Cresco&#x27;s schools continued to evolve to meet its expanding student population&#x27;s needs. In 1893, a grade school building was erected on the central campus. This structure experienced a devastating fire in 1917.

In response to the growing demands of Cresco&#x27;s educational landscape, the South Ward grade school was constructed in 1896. This facility underwent a comprehensive renovation in 1953.

=== Physical growth and development (1905–1913) ===
To meet Cresco&#x27;s ever-changing educational requirements, a new high school building was erected in 1905. Citizens in the independent school district approved the project, with a budget not exceeding $25,000, in March that year. The construction bids were awarded in May, and by December, classes were already being held in the newly completed facilities.

The structure, 100 feet by 80 feet, was built out of pressed brick and Postville stone. It reached a height of 84 feet from the grade line to the top of its dome. The cornice and bell tower were made of galvanized iron. Though called a high school, the building held classes for students in grades 3 to 12.

The building&#x27;s first floor consisted of the superintendent&#x27;s office and five grade rooms. On the second floor was the seventh-grade room, six high-school classrooms, four recitation rooms, an assembly room, and a laboratory. The basement housed the manual training department and the furnace room.

The building used a steam heating system and an advanced ventilation system. In 1910, &quot;The Howard County Times&quot; wrote: &quot;a series of air ducts lead to the cupola where a number of radiators form an upward current that completely changes the air of all rooms in approximately three minutes. Fresh air from the outside is first warmed over radiators and then conducted to all the rooms, after which it passes out through the ducts leading to the cupola.&quot;

Dora Perry, a student and later a teacher in Cresco, provided a detailed description of the new building in the 1906 &quot;Old Rose and Black&quot; yearbook. She wrote:The new high school building that was erected by the citizens of Cresco in 1905 does honor to the city. It is approached by a sidewalk from East Peck Street to the south or main entrance. Observing its overall structure, one can see that it is built of pressed brick, standing on a foundation of Bedford sandstone. Rising above the spacious roof is the dome and flagstaff, where the Star Spangled Banner often waves over the heads of the many school children. Engraved on the southern side, above the main entrance, is the date 1905. The building can be accessed through three entrances: the main entrance to the south, and the east and west entrances. Let us enter the building and take a quick glance at the interior. The heating and ventilation systems are well-designed, with radiators placed throughout the building. Down in the basement, we find the manual training room. The seventh grade expects to take up this branch of school work in the near future. Across the hall from the manual training department is the furnace room. As we admire the impressive machinery of the heating apparatus, we can&#x27;t help but marvel at the ingenuity of the human mind to invent such intricate mechanisms for the comfort of others. Now, entering the vestibule, we encounter the stairway that leads to the first floor. While standing there, the following words come to mind: &quot;&#x27;Life is what you make it, the world is as you take it.&#x27;&quot; To the right of the stairway is the superintendent&#x27;s office, divided into a public and private office by an oak partition. Its ambiance clearly indicates that both pleasant and unpleasant business is conducted there. On the first floor, there are five grade rooms. The third grade is furnished with large double seats that remind us of the time when we were embarking on our first battles of life. Yet, this room does not exude laziness but rather reflects the hard work accomplished by its occupants. Next to the third grade, across the corridor, is the fourth grade. It is similar to the previous room but displays a higher level of intellectual development, evident in the ornamental details on the walls. Moving west, we find the fifth grade. This cheerful room provides an enjoyable learning environment for the children. Then we come across the sixth grade, where eager faces are ready to tackle their daily tasks. Across the south corridor is the eighth grade. Here, we witness a noticeable development of mental prowess. On the wall, there is a bust of Lincoln, presented to the grade on February 22nd. This statue reminds us of the lines penned by Longfellow: &quot;&#x27;Lives of great men all remind us, we can make our lives sublime.&quot;&#x27; Two stairways lead to the second story, and the first room we encounter is the seventh grade. The interior of this room showcases the students&#x27; artwork, with their talent displayed on the walls. Among these works, a picture of Robert Burns holds a prominent place.In subsequent years, Cresco underwent additional construction projects that further transformed its educational institutions. In 1913, a new grade school building was erected on the west side of the central campus, at an estimated cost of $13,000. This expanded the educational infrastructure, accommodating the growing number of students at the grade-school level.

In 1919, Cresco opened the east high school building and the West Ward school building. To finance these projects, bonds totaling $56,000 were issued.

=== Modernization (1927–1951) ===
Cresco Junior College, founded on September 6, 1927, was in a renovated house opposite the high school buildings. It enrolled 19 students in its first year and 23 students the next year. The college faced a setback due to small enrollment and ceased operations after two years. 

In 1935, a new corridor was constructed, linking the 1905 building with the 1919 building. The same year, plans began for the construction of a gymnasium. It was completed in 1938. As part of this expansion, the gymnasium in the 1919 building was reconfigured into a small performance space.

Further expansions and additions were made in 1951 with a new garage and bus barn, and a band room for the music program.

=== Consolidation and expansion (1960–1983) ===
The Howard-Winneshiek Community School District was established on July 1, 1960, through the consolidation of public schools. This brought together the public schools of Chester, Cresco, Elma, Lime Springs, and Ridgeway, necessitating the expansion of educational infrastructure to accommodate the growing student population.

In December 1965, voters approved a $1,500,000 bond proposal whose primary objective was to fund the construction of new elementary buildings in Lime Springs and Ridgeway and a high school in Cresco. Construction of the high school began in 1967, and Crestwood High School opened in 1968. During the transition to the new high school, the original school buildings in the Central Complex continued to be used for elementary and junior high courses. In 1983, these buildings underwent extensive renovations.

=== A new century (1991–present) ===
In July 1991, the citizens of the Howard-Winneshiek Community School District approved a bond issue of $5.975 million to fund construction of a new K-8 building north of Crestwood High School. They also approved the allocation of $700,000 from an existing schoolhouse fund balance specifically designated for the renovation of the outlying centers, ensuring that these educational spaces would receive the necessary upgrades and improvements.

The total cost of this initiative was $7.2 million. A majority of 64.5% voted in favor of the new school.

<text>Bradgate is a city in Humboldt County, Iowa, United States, at the conjunction of Sections 5, 6, 7, and 8 of Avery Township, and rests near the banks of the West Fork of the Des Moines River. The population was 75 in the 2020 census, a decline from 101 in 2000.

On May 21, 2004, the town was almost completely destroyed by a tornado.

==History==

===Last battle between two Iowa American Indian tribes===
Nearby Avery&#x27;s Hill was the site of a significant event in Iowa history. The last battle between two American Indian tribes in Iowa was fought on this hill in 1854 between the Sioux and the Winnebagos.

Some eighteen Sioux warriors under the leadership of Coustawa (Big Tree) surprised the tribe of Winnebago but were driven back after the death of Coustawa. One of the Sioux warriors was reported to be Inkpaduta, who later led a band of Sioux in the famed Spirit Lake Massacre. The Pocahontas County Historical Society has marked the battle spot on the former Clarence Stearns farm with a flag pole and plaque memorial.

A few area residents of Bradgate and surrounding community have acquired large collections of American Indian artifacts, including arrowheads, discovered during walks along the river and on Avery&#x27;s Hill.

===The early days and origin of name===
The first settlement just east of present Bradgate (Section 8) was named Willow Glen with no record of why this name was chosen. However, when the town was platted, the name was changed to Bradgate. Several theories are given as to why this name was chosen but the one accepted by most is that Bradgate was named after Bradgate Park at Newtown Linford, six miles northwest of Leicester in Leicestershire County, England. Likewise, just as Leicestershire County is located just west of Rutland County in England, the town of Bradgate, Iowa, is similarly located just six miles to the northwest of the town of Rutland in Humboldt County, Iowa. There were at least seven English families who left England and moved directly to the Bradgate, Iowa, area.

Bradgate was platted by the Western Town Lot Company in 1881–1882 on the Toledo branch of the Chicago and North Western Railway in Avery Township of Humboldt County. The plat was filed for record on March 7, 1882. The post office was established April 7, 1882.

Cord N. King came to Avery Township in 1864 and purchased 247 acres. He farmed this land and operated a grocery store. Much of the land was donated to the railroad by Cord N. King. It was hoped that the terminal would be built at this spot, but after the entire valley of the Des Moines River flooded on July 7, 1881, it was decided to move the terminal to Eagle Grove.

John Wesley King built a house near the post office and became the town&#x27;s first postmaster.

===&quot;The town that wouldn’t die&quot;===
In the summer of 1950, three people from &quot;Life Magazine&quot; spent a number of days in Bradgate taking numerous pictures and interviewing nearly everyone for a special profile on a small Iowa town. When the article came to be published, residents were anxious to read the story which profiled their farm community. But when the August 1950 issue appeared, all were disappointed. Bradgate was pictured as a dying town.

This has remained a sore spot in the years since and in 1976, the motto “The town that wouldn’t die” was chosen to commemorate the community&#x27;s resolve to withstand the dire premonition and continue forward.

===2004 Tornado===

On May 21, 2004, a tornado rated F2 struck the town of Bradgate causing widespread damage. The National Weather Service reported that a tornado struck near Rolfe at 6:10 p.m. and hit Bradgate at 6:23 p.m. The tornado severely damaged 30 of the 42 homes in Bradgate. The only building in town that did not receive damage was the new fire station. Though fifteen people sustained minor injuries from flying debris, residents were grateful there were no fatalities.

The tornado that started near Rolfe continued on a 16-mile journey, damaging farm houses, trees, and power lines along the way. MidAmerican Energy power lines and poles, from Rutland north to the Bradgate blacktop, were toppled over the roadway. A storm damage survey team from the National Weather Service in Des Moines rated the tornado F2 in strength. A tornado rated F2 has estimated winds of 113-157 mph, based upon estimates in the Fujita Scale.

==Parks and recreation==
===Avery&#x27;s Hill===
One of the local tourist spots is Avery&#x27;s Hill, located to the west of town above the West Fork of the Des Moines River, and like the township, named after Oscar F. Avery, the area&#x27;s first settler who came to farm. The hill is visited for its nature, wildlife, and mushroom hunts. Avery built his house in November 1859 and planted corn the following spring.

Avery&#x27;s Hill is a wildlife refuge and a place where several generations of area youngsters have engaged in sledding or tobogganing down the large expansive hill.

During the 1920s, an effort was unsuccessfully made to make Avery&#x27;s Hill into a park. In 1976, after private ownership of the land had changed hands, an effort was successfully made to prevent further tilling and destruction of the scenic area.

The hill was the site of a significant event in Iowa history. The last battle between two American Indian tribes in Iowa was fought on this hill in 1854 between the Sioux and the Winnebagos.

<text>Humboldt is a city in Humboldt County, Iowa, United States. The population was 4,792 at the time of the 2020 census, gaining 102 people over the 2010 total.

== History ==
Frank A. Gotch Park (just south of present-day Humboldt and Dakota City) was the location of prehistoric and some Dakota Indian villages, near where the two forks of the Des Moines River meet. During westward expansion in the 1800s, this area is thought to have been the location of a fort/trading post called Fort Confederation. According to federal records, in 1825, permission was granted to build the fort to trade with the Ihanktonwan Dakota (Yankton Sioux) Indians. Information about the exact details of the fort are unclear, such as if American, French Canadian, or Metis traders built it, bringing up many questions about this fort.

The founder of modern Humboldt, Stephen Harris Taft, laid out the plans for Springvale, the original name of the town, in 1863. It was named Springvale because of the several natural springs found near the Des Moines River. Taft had very big plans for the community, and expected many intellectuals from the East to move to his new community.

Taft had five goals for his idyllic community.

*The town shall be surrounded and full of trees and forests.
*The town shall be free of the sale of intoxicants.
*The town shall be founded upon a saw mill and grist mill on the Des Moines River
*The town shall have the moral fortitude of a solid church and good schools, and that it shall become a town of thinkers and beauty.
*The town shall grow with a college of university importance, and have a church that will not dissent into factions.
Taft undertook the great task of turning empty, blooming prairie into the community of his dreams. He brought out a group of settlers (including a doctor) in 1863, and they lived together in the few houses that had been built. The grist mill was built, known now as the Corydon Brown House. The first few years were spent laying out the town. Taft wanted very wide boulevards throughout the town, and the community is still known for its streets. Taft also edited the &quot;Humboldt County True Democrat&quot; through the offices of the &quot;Fort Dodge Sentinel&quot; in Fort Dodge.

Springvale was renamed Humboldt (after the German explorer and naturalist Alexander von Humboldt) in hope of a merger between Springvale and Dakota City (the county seat of Humboldt County), but no merger took place. This is the first of two major shortcomings that would stunt Humboldt&#x27;s growth and keep it from reaching Taft&#x27;s goals.

A meeting in 1866 occurred that formed the Springvale Collegiate Association, led by Taft. After the flood in 1867 that destroyed the town&#x27;s dam, the issue became popular again in 1869. The association was renamed to Humboldt Collegiate Association in accordance with the town&#x27;s name change. It was reported that &quot;great enthusiasm&quot; was the feeling in the room, however when the question was posed to the county&#x27;s voters on October 12, 1869, the measure to appropriate swampland for a Northern Iowa College was defeated. Taft was not defeated, however, and looked East for funding. After almost missing a payment deadline that would&#x27;ve sunk the college for good, Taft broke ground on June 17, 1870. He ended his address by saying &quot;Hundreds are here present today. Tens of thousands shall gather here a hundred years hence to commemorate the birth of the institution and rejoice in the blessings it shall have conferred.&quot;

Humboldt College opened its doors on September 13, 1872. The first three years were designed as preparatory work intended to supplement the pupils&#x27; public education that ended around eighth grade. The subsequent four years were college work. June 1879 brought the first graduation class of three families. They would be the only students to ever receive a degree from the institution. At this time, Taft and the college were in financial trouble. An endowment fund capable of supporting Taft&#x27;s vision seemed impossible to create, and following turbulent financial times in the East, the college closed in 1916. The building was razed in 1926, following unsuccessful attempts to rent the structure. Without the college, Taft&#x27;s dreams of Humboldt becoming an intellectual center of knowledge in the West could not be realized.
In July 1955, when contacts between Americans and Soviets were rare, Humboldt hosted a delegation of Soviet officials (and national and international reporters) for an overnight glimpse of rural American life.

On March 27, 1972, ABC-TV broadcast a half-hour documentary on Humboldt entitled &quot;A Small Town in Iowa.&quot; The program was written and produced by Andy Rooney and narrated by Harry Reasoner, a Humboldt native. The show portrayed Humboldt as a kind of paradise that struggled to keep its most talented youth from leaving for larger cities, and asked, &quot;what is it about paradise that&#x27;s turning the bright kids off?&quot; The answer, according to Reasoner and Rooney, was that &quot;what seems to be missing is more a shortcoming of ours, than of the small town. It is that those of us with ego and ambition are not usually happy performing in front of an audience the size a small town provides.&quot;

The First National Bank of Humboldt and its shareholders were the primary victims of what the &quot;Des Moines Register&quot; described as “one of the most spectacular white-collar crimes in state history.” In 1982 Humboldt native Gary Vance Lewellyn, then a Des Moines stockbroker, attempted to pump up the value of the stock of a high-tech company by singlehandedly creating phony market demand for it. To carry out the scheme, he illegally obtained access to bonds of the First National Bank of Humboldt valued at $16.7 million, and secretly pledged the Bank&#x27;s bonds as security for his personal orders of the company&#x27;s stock through Wall Street investment firms. When Lewellyn missed margin calls on his stock purchases, the firms obtained the bonds. Suspicious federal regulators closed the Humboldt Bank when it could not account for its missing bonds (and considered, but rejected, the idea of liquidating it). Its accountholders were protected by federal insurance but the shares in the bank became worthless. For his crime, Lewellyn was sentenced to twenty years in prison, but served only five years. Lewellyn died in 2012.

==Geography==
Humboldt is located at (42.723631, -94.221520). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Humboldt County is located entirely within the Des Moines Lobe of the Western Corn Belt Plains ecoregion, as defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). One of the flattest regions in Iowa, the Des Moines Lobe ecoregion is a distinctive area naturally defined by Wisconsin glaciation but modified by humans for extensive agriculture. In general, the land is level to gently rolling with some areas of relief defined by glacial features like moraines, hummocky knobs, and kettles, and outwash deposits. The lobe does not have any loess deposits like the Loess Hills to the west.

The stream network is poorly developed and widely spaced, with major rivers carving valleys that are relatively deep and steep-sided. Almost all of the natural lakes of Iowa are found in the northern part of this region (the Iowa Great Lakes). Most of the region has been converted from wet prairie to agricultural use with substantial surface water drainage. Only a small fraction of the wetlands remain, and many natural lakes have been drained as a result of agricultural drainage projects via drainage tiles or ditches.

===Climate===
Humboldt, like almost all of Iowa, has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;). Humboldt experiences all four seasons characterized by cold winters, wet springs, hot summers, and relatively short autumns. Wide temperature ranges are common within this climate zone.

The community was previously within the Deep River–Millersburg Community School District, which was established in 1958 as a consolidation of the Millersburg and Deep River school districts. In 1992, the district closed its secondary school and began a joint whole grade-sharing program with the English Valleys district and the Montezuma Community School District, in which it sent its junior and senior high school students to both districts; each student chose which secondary school he/she wished to attend. On July 1, 2009, the DR-M district was consolidated into the English Valleys district, although a portion of it was given to the Montezuma district.

English Valleys took possession of the remaining school building in Millersburg and did not immediately decide as to its disposition. As of December 2009 it remained empty, and there were potential plans to convert the building into transitional housing for poor families or those affected by domestic violence.

<text>Parnell is a city in Iowa County, Iowa, United States. The population was 194 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==

Parnell, in Fillmore Township, Iowa County, Iowa, was named after Charles Stewart Parnell, a noble Irish statesman who had come to the American people to plead the cause of Ireland&#x27;s land-impoverished peasants.

The Milwaukee Railroad helped to create Parnell. In 1884, the people of the little Irish town of Lytle City moved residences, stores, buildings, and families three miles west to where the railroad was beginning.

The people of Lytle City, who were mostly members of the Catholic Church, then became residents of Parnell. The town was incorporated on March 24, 1891, with a population of 156.

The early businesses consisted of a hardware store, grocery store, a drug store, a foundry and blacksmith, a newspaper office, hotel, a livery stable, tavern, dry goods store, millinery shop, a photographer, opera house, and a bank.

Catholic church services began in the fall of 1888. St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church was erected the next year. The Rev. James Davis was its first pastor. This was the largest Catholic Church in the county; and the only church in Parnell until March 16, 1958, when the Parnell Mennonite Church became an organized congregation. The St. Joseph&#x27;s Cemetery was established in 1892 east of town. Due to deteriorating conditions, the church was torn down on April 27, 2010.

The Parnell school district was first known as Locust Grove Independent district. The school house was one mile east of town for the first two years. In order to accommodate the pupils in town and in the western part of the district, school was held in a store building in Parnell in the winter of 1888–1889. Birdie Costello and W.J. Naughton were the first teachers. In 1889, a new one-room building was erected; and later in 1899, a four-room brick structure was built. The school became a high school in 1899. In 1907, it adopted the eleventh grade course; and in 1915, it was raised to twelfth grade. In 1916, the Parnell Consolidated School was open-ed, becoming Parnell&#x27;s first public school. The Sisters of Humility were transferred to this school, which until 1955, was one of the few public schools in the state to utilize Roman Catholic nuns as instructors.

Early families of Parnell included the Shuells, Murphys, Hannons, Tiernans, Kellys, McDonalds, Dwyers, Callans, Eagletons, Lawlers, Tourneys, McCunes, Mullinex&#x27;, Naughtons, Quinns, Sheridans, Mastersons, Ryans, Leahys, Murrins, Coakleys, Carneys, Sullivans and Weldons.

In 1985, businesses included Weldon&#x27;s DX, Shamrock Cafe, Royal Beauty Salon, Parnell Sandwich &amp; Cone Shoppe, Parnell Tavern, Parnell Post Office, Central Midwest Petroleum, Parnell Cycle Shop, and Johnny O&#x27;s Car Wash.

The St. Michael&#x27;s Church, Cemetery, Rectory and Ancient Order of Hibernians Hall, located four miles to the east in the hamlet of Holbrook was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

In the 1870s there was an attempt to change the name to Chester, and deeds from that decade often list the town as “Chester, formerly Williamsburg.” The name disputes were ended in 1885, when the town was incorporated as Williamsburg after the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad passed through the year before and brought a population boom.

<text>Andrew is a town in central Jackson County, Iowa, United States. The population was 380 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Andrew, located in Jackson County, was named for the seventh president, Andrew Jackson.

In 1841 Ansel Briggs, the first governor of Iowa, settled on a location outside of Andrew known as Bluff Mills, later moving his family to town. He became the Jackson County deputy treasurer in 1843 then began a two-year term as Sheriff of Jackson County in 1844. Ansel Briggs won the election against Thomas McKnight for the governor of Iowa in 1846. Briggs served as governor until 1850. On September 22, 1909, the citizens of Andrew erected a granite monument in the city cemetery in his honor. Although Briggs was originally buried in Omaha, Nebraska, he was re-interred in 1909 in the Andrew Cemetery.

Andrew was incorporated in 1863, with the first record of ordinances recorded in 1867. The county seat switched between Bellevue and Andrew several times until it was moved to Maquoketa in 1873. The county seat was responsible for much of the growth of the city. An orphans asylum and courthouse was built along with other structures to serve the county government.

The Jackson County Jailhouse was built in 1870 and is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The three-story limestone structure includes sheriff&#x27;s office, cell room, exercise yard, a jailer quarters, and prison kitchen. The jailhouse has since been restored and tours are given.

The first school was made of logs in 1841 and the second was a framed structure. A brick building was built in 1889 at the present location of the school, 13 South Marion Street. Andrew Community School conducts preschool through eighth grade level classes, with the former high school being closed in 2011.

Andrew is the birthplace of the first American military casualty of World War II, Captain Robert M. Losey, who was killed during a German Luftwaffe bombing of Dombås, Norway.

Andrew has three churches: St John&#x27;s Catholic Church (closed), First Presbyterian Church, and Salem Lutheran Church. Salem Lutheran Church was organized in 1863 and built one of Iowa&#x27;s first orphanages.

<text>Bellevue ( ) is a city in eastern Jackson County, Iowa, United States. The city lies along the Mississippi River (at Lock and Dam No. 12) and next to Bellevue State Park. In 2020 its population was 2,363; up from a count of 2,191 at the 2010 Census, making it the second-largest and only growing city in Jackson County.

The city lies in a valley created by two large bluffs (known as North and South Bluffs respectively), with the Mississippi River serving as the city&#x27;s eastern border (the Illinois state border), and with the Mill Creek valley extending to the west. Geographically, it is part of the southernmost region of the Driftless Area, a portion of North America that escaped all three phases of the Wisconsinian Glaciation.

It is one of the few cities in Iowa to be built near large hills and bluffs, which account for much of the city&#x27;s economic stimulation as a tourist town. The city attributes its name from the French words &#x27;Belle&#x27; and &#x27;Vue&#x27; meaning &#x27;beautiful view&#x27;, as well as an early settler, John D. Bell. The unique history and architecture of Bellevue draw visitors year round, mainly from nearby large population centers (including Dubuque and Maquoketa). 

==History==
Jackson County, along with Jones and Linn Counties were established in 1837 and Bellevue was the named the seat of justice for all three counties. Prior to the formal opening of the county, Bellevue was laid out by John D. Bell in 1835. He built a cabin there and was the town&#x27;s first postmaster. The first hotel was built by Peter Dutell in 1836, and was called the Bellevue House. When Iowa became a territory in 1838, the first census was taken and Jackson County had 881 people. The town of Bellevue constructed a city hall that serves as the Bellevue Public Library on the upper level. The Bellevue War of 1840 gave the town an unsavory reputation and discouraged settlement in its aftermath. However, the population would double within two years. In 1838 the town of Andrew was designated as the county seat. Between 1848 and 1876, the struggle between Andrew and Bellevue for the county seat continued with the county seat being moved from one town to the other several times, with Bellevue constructing a county courthouse in 1845 that now serves as Bellevue Elementary, the oldest functioning school building in Iowa. As the county was settled, Maquoketa would become the dominant centrally located town when the railroad reached Maquoketa in 1873. The Town of Maquoketa then built a large city hall and offered to lease the building to Jackson County as a courthouse. The proposition was put to a vote and approved, and since then, Maquoketa has been the county seat.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Climate===
Bellevue has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;), which gives it four distinct seasons. However, local weather is often not as extreme as that found in other parts of the Midwest, such as Minnesota or Wisconsin. Spring is usually wet and rainy, summers are sunny and warm, autumn is mild, and winters are typically cloudy and snowy.

==Culture==

Bellevue has a rich history that has greatly influenced the culture of the city. The prehistoric Woodland Native Americans made their homes in the fertile valleys where Bellevue lies. Much later, so did the Thâkîwaki and the Meskwaki of which evidence can be found in the form of burial mounds high on the south bluff overlooking the river. The European pioneers arrived as fur traders, farmers, and merchants looking to settle new land beginning in 1833; many floating across the Mississippi River on logs. These early settlers formed Bell View, the oldest city in the county and one of the five oldest cities in Iowa. The spelling was later changed to the French, Belle Vue and in time the two words were united and the town became Bellevue.

Today, the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa maintain ancestral attachments to the Bellevue area.

===Historic Sites===
==Education==
===Public education===
Bellevue Community School District provides educational services to Bellevue, as well as the surrounding countryside and cities of La Motte, Springbrook, and St. Donatus. The school&#x27;s colors are royal blue and white, and their mascot/team name is the Comets. Bellevue High School is located on a campus on the western edge of town, which also includes an attached middle school and athletic facilities. The high school underwent significant renovations in 2010, with the addition of a gymnasium, stage, cafeteria, student commons, locker rooms, Hall of Pride, and district offices. The Bellevue Community School District also includes the public Bellevue Elementary School, located in the pre-Civil War Jackson County Courthouse which was built in 1845. The district supports free preschool and grades PK-12, with a total enrollment of 765 students in the 2019–2020 school year. In October 2019, school officials reported that enrollment for the district increased 10% over the past 5 years, contrary to State officials who have predicted a long term declining enrollment trend.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Highways====
Bellevue radiates from the intersection of US HWY 52 (Riverview Dr.) and Iowa HWY 62 (State St). US HWY 52 continues north to St. Donatus and Dubuque and south to Sabula, before entering Savanna, Illinois via the new Dale Gardner Veterans Memorial Bridge. Highway 62 continues on to Andrew and terminates in the county seat, Maquoketa. Other roads coming into the city are Bellevue-Cascade Road (County D61) which terminates near Cascade, and Mill Creek Road (County D56) which terminates in La Motte.

====River====
Historically, there were hundreds of river steamboats that stopped at the grand staircase that led from the higher Riverfront Park to the riverbank to transfer passengers and necessary goods. The Mississippi River still is an essential route of economical transport for freight (with barges frequently passing), but no longer regularly carries commercial goods or passengers. Towards the mid 20th century travel by riverboat was no longer the best mode of transportation, and that aspect of travel diminished along Bellevue&#x27;s banks. In the 21st century there has been an uptick in leisure cruises on recreations of large historical steamships that act as cruise vessels on the Mississippi. With Lock and Dam No. 12 bisecting the river, these steamships occasionally stop to let off passengers to shop and eat at establishments along Riverview Drive as they wait to lock through.

The city offers multiple locations to launch vessels, including the Municipal Boat Ramp (found below Riverview Park at the intersection of State Street and Riverview Drive), Bellevue Public Area Ramp (found south of town along US HWY 52), and at the Pleasant Creek Recreation Area (found 4 miles south of town along US HWY 52). Spruce Creek Park, located 3 miles north of Bellevue off of 395th Ave, offers a boat ramp as well as a large harbor for storage of boats, with some covered boat slips. The harbor is managed by Jackson County Conservation.

====Airport====
The nearest moderately sized commercial airport is Dubuque Regional Airport south of Dubuque, IA along US HWY 61. Some small local airports in Maquoketa, Clinton, and Davenport serve small aircraft and agricultural purposes, with the nearest large commercial location being the Quad City International Airport in Moline, IL

====Rail====
In the center of the town, there is an on-street running railroad used for long freight trains. The railway is frequently used and divides Second Street on either side of it. Streets crossing this rail line include (from north to south) Jefferson Ave, Motte St, High St, Park St, Market St, State St (HWY 62), Jefferson St, Chestnut St, Vine St, and an underpass at the south end of 2nd St (Potter Dr). Formerly, a depot and rail yard supported passenger traffic along the now defunct Chicago, Bellevue, Cascade &amp; Western Railway Company, which was a narrow-gauge railway. Since its closure in the 1930s, the east–west running railroad was broken up, leaving the remaining north–south standard gauge railway that remain today under the control of the Alberta based Canadian Pacific Railway. There no longer are any passenger trains on Bellevue&#x27;s rails.

<text>Maquoketa () is a city in Jackson County, Iowa, United States. Located on the Maquoketa River, it is the county seat of Jackson County.

U.S. Route 61 adjoins the city, which therefore hosts traffic between Dubuque and the Quad Cities. Iowa Highways 62 and 64 also pass through the city. Maquoketa Caves State Park is located a few miles northwest of Maquoketa.

The population was 6,128 at the time of the 2020 census.

== History ==
John E. Goodenow, the inaugural settler in the region, arrived in what is now recognized as Maquoketa in 1838. He established his residence on the present-day southeast corner of Main and Platt streets, erecting a cabin in that vicinity. By 1840, Zalmon Livermore had acquired the quarter section on the northeast corner of this intersection, while Alonzo Spaulding claimed the northwest corner, and John Shaw occupied the southwest corner. The center of today&#x27;s business district was originally the epicenter of this early settlement, known at the time as Springfield. The town&#x27;s growth was propelled by two key factors: its strategic location at the intersection of the Davenport-to-Dubuque mail and stage route, as well as its proximity to the path used by pioneers traveling from Chicago to the west. Additionally, the abundance of water in the area facilitated the development of industries along the North and South Forks of the Maquoketa River.

Around 1840, the mail route between Davenport and Dubuque was established through Springfield, located on what is now Main Street in Maquoketa. Consequently, the post office moved to Springfield, with John Goodenow appointed as postmaster. In 1844, due to multiple towns named Springfield in the area, the town was renamed Maquoketa, after the Maquoketa River. The river&#x27;s name derives from &quot;Maquaw-Autaw&quot;, which means &quot;Bear River&quot; in Meskwaki. 

As other nearby towns declined, Maquoketa emerged as the primary center of commerce. In 1843, early settlers began dividing their land into lots informally, resulting in the irregular lot sizes seen in the modern business district. With the increasing settlement and the importance of the mail route, demand for lodging grew. In 1849, John Goodenow built the Goodenow House, the town&#x27;s first hotel, near Main and Platt streets, drawing visitors and showcasing Maquoketa&#x27;s potential for growth.

The Davenport and St. Paul Railroad was extended to Maquoketa in 1870 prompting growth. The county seat was transferred from Andrew to Maquoketa in 1873.

Maquoketa experienced a period of economic growth during the late 19th century, primarily due to its location near valuable natural resources such as timber, limestone, and fertile farmland. As the town prospered, wealthy residents sought to display their affluence through the construction of grand homes many of which are still extant within the community.

The onset of the First World War in 1917 significantly affected the commercial district. Numerous businesses experienced the loss of young male employees, either through voluntary enlistment or compulsory military service. Upon the war&#x27;s conclusion in 1918, returning soldiers were ceremoniously welcomed home with parades along Main Street.

Following the stock market crash of 1929, the Great Depression brought a halt to construction activity in the commercial district. The American Savings Bank closed its doors, leading to the renovation of its building at 100 S. Main Street in 1935. The revamped structure housed a National Tea Company grocery store on the ground floor and served as meeting space for the American Legion above. This renovation, which included the removal of classical pilasters and the installation of modern storefront materials, signaled a shift in the district&#x27;s architectural landscape. Despite these changes, Maquoketa experienced relatively moderate economic effects compared to other regions, likely due to its strategic location at the intersection of two commercial highways.

After World War II, Maquoketa, Iowa experienced a surge in residential construction, particularly on the west side of town. Many of these homes were constructed on old farmland, This rapid suburbanization not only met the housing needs of the time but also contributed to the town&#x27;s post-war growth and prosperity. 

In 1950, Maquoketa, Iowa, reached a significant milestone in its healthcare infrastructure by constructing its first public hospital. Prior to this development, the town had relied on a patchwork of privately-run small hospitals to meet the healthcare needs of its residents. These small hospitals, while providing essential services, often faced limitations in terms of capacity, resources, and accessibility.

Maquoketa experienced another pivotal moment with the relocation of the Clinton Machine Company to the city in 1950. Don Thomas spearheaded this move, establishing the company on a 12-acre plot within Maquoketa, strategically leveraging a rail spur for transportation. Clinton Engines, a division of the company, became a powerhouse, producing approximately 18 million small engines and ranking as the 10th largest employer in Iowa. 

In the 1960s, Maquoketa, Iowa witnessed the emergence of a new commercial district. Main Street, formerly part of US Highway 61, underwent a significant transformation with the planning and construction of a four-lane highway bypass starting in the late 1960s. As the bypass project progressed, many businesses along Main Street made plans to relocate to the west side of town in anticipation of increased automobile traffic from the highway. Following the opening of the Highway 61 bypass in 1967, there was a notable shift in commercial activity away from Main Street towards the new commercial district. Despite this disinvestment in the Main Street area, property owners remained committed to maintaining the integrity of the existing buildings, ensuring they remained in good repair.

During the 1980s, many towns in Jackson County, Iowa, faced significant challenges, particularly due to the farm crisis that devastated rural communities across the region. While the county as a whole experienced population declines and economic hardships, Maquoketa saw only minor decreases in its population. Nevertheless, the farm crisis did have negative repercussions for Maquoketa, impacting local agricultural businesses and contributing to a sense of economic uncertainty within the community.

In 1999 the town was bypassed by the now four lane Highway Sixty-One, further diverting traffic away from the downtown area. This highway bypass had detrimental effects on Maquoketa&#x27;s economy, as it resulted in decreased traffic flow through the town center, affecting local businesses that relied on passing trade. Additionally, the bypass diminished Maquoketa&#x27;s visibility and accessibility, further exacerbating economic challenges for the community. Despite these setbacks, Maquoketa persisted in its efforts to adapt and evolve, seeking new avenues for economic growth and community development in the face of adversity.

The early 2000s posed significant economic challenges for Maquoketa, Iowa, exacerbating the struggles of its downtown district. Already grappling with vacant storefronts and declining economic activity, the town faced further hardship during this period including the closure of the Clinton Engines Company. However, the most devastating blow came on January 19th, 2008, when a large portion of the downtown area, already struggling, succumbed to a devastating fire. While tragic, this event served as a catalyst for change, sparking renewed efforts to revitalize the downtown district and enhance the overall community. 

Beginning in the 2010s, Maquoketa experienced a wave of revitalization, marked by the attraction of new businesses, significant infrastructure investments, and a renewed focus on preserving its historic downtown district.

One notable development was the construction of a new hospital in 2019, enhancing healthcare services for residents. Additionally, Maquoketa embarked on ambitious housing initiatives, including the construction of new housing developments to meet the growing demand for residential properties.

On September 11, 2012, the East Central School and Preston School districts held a special vote to determine whether or not to merge their school districts. The Preston School district voted 86.5% in favor of the merger, and after a recount showed a slimmer but still passing margin of 620 East Central votes for and 598 against, the communities created the new Easton Valley School District (EVSD).

The EVSD elementary schools are now located in Miles, while the middle and high schools are in Preston.

<text>Sabula is a city in Jackson County, Iowa, United States. The population was 506 at the 2020 census. Sabula is the site of Iowa&#x27;s only island city. The island has a beach and a campground, as well as a harbor with boat docks and storage sheds to store boats during the winter. Sabula is the northern terminus of U.S. Route 67, a 1,560 mile (2,511 km) long north–south highway in the Central United States. The southern terminus of the route is at the United States–Mexico border in Presidio, Texas.

==History==
Sabula was established in 1835 when, according to legend, Isaac Dorman crossed the river from the Illinois side on a log and decided to settle on the present site of Sabula. Sabula is a name of French origin meaning &quot;sand&quot;; this refers to the sandy soil of the area.

In the late 19th century the principal industries in the community included a large &quot;pearl button&quot; factory—which produced buttons from clam shells harvested from large clam beds located in the river adjacent to the shoreline. (The factory is no longer there.) The thriving community also supported a large hog slaughtering industry.

The community did not actually become an island until the lock and dam system was constructed by the Army Corps of Engineers on the upper Mississippi in the 1930s. The construction of Lock and Dam No. 13 between Clinton, Iowa and Fulton, Illinois in 1939 left the lowlands west of the townsite permanently flooded, creating the &quot;Island City,&quot; as the town is now known.

==Geography==

Sabula is located at (42.067866, −90.174270).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Sabula is connected to Iowa via a roadway that runs between two lakes and with Savanna, Illinois, by another roadway that leads to a bridge that crosses the Mississippi River.

==Government==

Sabula has a post office and a community center. Fire protection is provided by the Sabula Volunteer Fire Department. The Sabula Fire Department protects everything within city limits as well as accident response in the ambulance district and is also available to respond mutual aid to other cities in Iowa and Illinois. Most of the city firefighters are certified as Iowa Firefighter Ones and Hazmat Operations. Quartered with the Fire Department is an Ambulance service also made up of volunteers which provides ambulances to the city and outlying areas. The Ambulance service operates two Basic Life Support Ambulances. Prior to the Sabula Ambulance (Originally called the &quot;Emergency Unit&quot;) the local funeral home provided a for profit ambulance. In 1974 the Fire Chief created the Emergency Unit and brought the first trained EMTs to the city drawn from firemen. Sabula has a public works department that plows the roads in winter and provides other services. Police protection is provided by the Sabula Police and Jackson County Sheriffs Office.

Sabula has a Mayor-Council city government. Meetings and elections are held in city hall.

==Education==
Sabula is a part of the Easton Valley Community School District, formed in 2013 by the merger of the East Central Community School District and the Preston Community School District. East Central formed in 1974 by the merger of the Sabula Community School District and the Miles Community School District. At one point the former East Central district entered into a grade-sharing relationship with the Northeast Community School District, in that East Central residents attended Northeast secondary schools.

Sabula previously had a school in the community, and it first met in a settler&#x27;s home in 1838. New campuses were built in 1856 and then in 1883. By circa 2012 the leadership of what would be the Easton Valley district was seeking to close the Sabula school due to potential future upkeep costs and because of how old it was. The Sabula school remained vacant until 2015, when the Easton Valley board voted unanimously in favor of demolishing it. The school district and the city government both agreed to demolition after considering other options and uses.

==Religion==
Sabula is served by three churches: Sabula United Methodist church (dating to 1839), St. Peter&#x27;s Catholic Church (dating to the 1840s), Calvary Lutheran Church (built in 1944).

<text>Colfax is a city in Jasper County, Iowa, United States. Colfax is located approximately 24 miles east of Des Moines. The town was founded in 1866, and was named after Schuyler Colfax, vice president under Ulysses S. Grant. The population was 2,255 at the time of the 2020 census. Newton is the county seat; both were named after Revolutionary War soldiers.

==History==
Colfax was laid out in 1866. It is named for Schuyler Colfax.

In its heyday, the city of Colfax had two main industries that drew thousands to the area: the mining of coal, and the use of the mineral springs discovered near the city.

The first large scale coal mine in Jasper County was the Watson No. 1 Mine, 5 miles southeast of town, connected to the Rock Island by a long railroad spur. From 1881 to 1900, the Jasper County Coal and Railway Company operated a number of mines north of Colfax. The Colfax Consolidated Coal Company formed in 1902, bringing the mines of Colfax under a common operator. They opened mine No. 8 in 1905; this was one of the best equipped mines in the state. The coal camp of Severs was run by this company.

United Mine Workers local 56 was organized in Colfax in 1899; by 1907, it had 352 members. Mine wages varied from $2.36 to $2.56 per day. In 1912, the UMW union had two locals based in Colfax, Local 56, with 350 members, and Local 671, with 230 members.

In the process of drilling for coal in 1875, a well containing high mineral content was discovered near Colfax. The city flourished with this new discovery, and over the next four decades, thousands of people visited the town to partake in the healing powers of the fourteen mineral springs there. Nine hotels offering mineral baths and spa treatments opened to house guests, and four bottling companies opened to produce bottled mineral water for the masses. In 1912–1913, the city received funding to build a Carnegie library. The library is still in use today.
The booming business of the city&#x27;s mineral springs industry declined and died out as the Great Depression swept the country.

<text>Newton is the county seat of, and most populous city in, Jasper County, Iowa, United States. Located east of Des Moines, Newton is in Central Iowa. As of the 2020 Census, the city population was 15,760. It is the home of Iowa Speedway and Maytag Dairy Farms.

==History==
===Early history===

Newton was founded in 1846 as Newton City, then shortened to Newton in 1847 and incorporated as a city in 1857. It was named to pair with Jasper County, following a common American naming scheme at the time in honor of Revolutionary War soldiers John Newton and William Jasper. In the late 19th century, Newton&#x27;s growth was fueled by the development of coal mines in the region. The first significant mine in the area was the Couch mine of the Jasper County Coal and Railway Company, opened in the 1870s. For a while, it was the largest mine in the county, producing 70 tons per day. William Snooks opened a mine near Newton in 1886. In the early 20th century, large scale mining in the Newton area had declined, but there were still several mines in the area that were worked intermittently.

===Maytag and the era of growth===
In the 20th century, Newton was a manufacturing community, much of its growth derived from the washing machine industry. Its most distinctive landmark, the Jasper County Courthouse, was built in 1911.

Newton entered the national stage in 1938 when martial law was declared during a strike at the Maytag Washing Machine Company. Iowa governor Nelson Kraschel ordered the Iowa National Guard to protect the company with tanks and machine guns ready against the workers. With the backing of four troops (companies) of the 113th Cavalry Regiment, Maytag company beat the strike and forced workers to return to work with a 10% pay cut.

At the conclusion of World War II, the Maytag Washing Machine Company expanded its operations in Newton, becoming the Maytag Corporation. Known for its dependable line of washing machines and clothes dryers, the company later persuaded the town of Newton to change the name of its headquarters address in the city to &quot;One Dependability Square.&quot; In 2001, a decision to cut labor costs resulted in a reduction of the labor force at the Newton plant in favor of newer Maytag facilities in Mexico. Layoffs at the Newton plant continued through 2005. Whirlpool&#x27;s acquisition of Maytag in early 2006 led to speculation over the future of Maytag operations in Newton. On May 10, 2006, Whirlpool announced that it would close the Newton plant and corporate offices in the fall of 2007. The plant employed about 1,000 workers and the corporate offices employed about 800 at the time of the announcement.

In January 2007, Whirlpool said in a statement that it sold most of the Maytag headquarters complex to Iowa Telecommunications Services Inc., a Newton-based telephone company which would use the complex to consolidate employees in a single location.

Although the company did not disclose financial details, Newton economic development officials said Iowa Telecom paid $1.5 million for the buildings assessed at more than $12 million. The Maytag plant officially ended production on October 25, 2007.

===&quot;Newton&#x27;s future&quot; and the rebound after Maytag===
After Maytag announced its departure, community leaders and City administration worked together to develop a plan to diversify Newton&#x27;s economy. After the Maytag plant closed, unemployment skyrocketed—rising to almost 10%. In 2010, Jasper County had the highest unemployment rate of Iowa&#x27;s 99 counties at 8.2%. However, in the following years, the unemployment rate dropped considerably—down to 5.4% in 2013. More impressively, Newton&#x27;s population did not drop following the departure of Maytag. Newton has had a steady population of about 15,000 since the 1960s.

Between 2007 and 2017, the following companies started in or moved to Newton: Underwriter&#x27;s Laboratory, Trinity Structural Towers, TPI Composites, Aureon, Walter G. Anderson, the Iowa Speedway, Health Enterprises, Engineered Plastics Company, Pact Manufacturing, Advanced Wheel Sales, and Hawkeye Stages.

Legacy Plaza, the former Maytag corporate campus, contains eight buildings dating back to the early 1900s. The site was donated to Des Moines Area Community College (DMACC) by Reza Kargarzadeh in 2016. Some of the space is leased; current tenants include Compass Mortgage, DMACC Business Resources, Thombert, Aureon, Gezellig Brewing Company, Murph &amp; Mary&#x27;s Pub, CIRAS, Iowa Lean Consortium, Aerocare, MCG and Edward Jones.

====Green manufacturing and sustainability====
One of the industrial sectors Newton has attracted in recent years is green manufacturing. In December 2007, TPI Composites announced plans to open a plant to manufacture massive wind turbine blades, which are now in production. Today, TPI Composites employs over 1,100 people and has expanded its operations by 100,000 square feet as they began manufacturing composite bus bodies with Proterra.

Additionally, Trinity Structural Towers, a company which manufactures wind turbine towers, opened in 2008. President Barack Obama visited the Trinity Structural Towers plant on April 22, 2009, that year&#x27;s Earth Day. While at the factory in Newton, the President said that he traveled to the factory to usher in &quot;a new era of energy exploration in America.&quot;

Newton was awarded the National Sustainable Community of the Year Award (Small City Category) by Siemens and the US Chamber of Commerce in 2010 for its successful, pro-active approach to recovery.

====Newton&#x27;s future: a comprehensive plan====
In 2012, the Newton City Council passed &quot;Newton&#x27;s Future: A Comprehensive Plan.&quot; The Comprehensive Plan was written with the input of Newton citizens and reflects the community&#x27;s goals for the future; the top goals identified in the plan were to grow Newton&#x27;s population with an emphasis toward targeting young families, increase employment opportunities, improve the City&#x27;s curb appeal, and fill vacant buildings and increase local shopping options.

==Arts and culture==
Newton is passionate in its support of the arts and culture. 

===Visual arts and sculpture===

Newton has an active arts community, with several non-profit organizations dedicated to the arts and many artists residing in the city. 

The Iowa Sculpture Festival was an annual event hosted in Newton which began in 2002.

The weekend-long event featured both local and internationally accomplished artists. The annual event ended in 2017.

Newton features more than 100 displays of public art with sculptures and painted murals throughout the community. The Iowa Sculpture Festival Committee sponsors a self-guided year-round sculpture and mural tour.

The Centre for Arts and Artists opened in Newton in 2005. The Centre for Arts and Artists is composed of 10 resident artist studios, a clay and kiln room, a therapeutic art room for children, a classroom, an extensive art and sculpture collection as well as a gift shop.

Additionally, the City of Newton puts on free weekly concerts at the Maytag Bowl throughout the summer in an event called &quot;Concerts at the Bowl.&quot; This event features local bands of all genres. The Newton City Band, a full concert band composed of Newton citizens, also performs at this event.

Newton also hosts the Miss Iowa USA and Miss Teen Iowa USA Pageants annually. The winners of these competitions go on to represent Iowa at the Miss USA Pageants.

Newton is home to one of America&#x27;s first business aircraft. The aircraft was a Travel Air 6000 owned by Harry Ogg, owner of the Automatic Washing Machine Company and was named &quot;Smiling Thru&quot;.

===Entertainment, recreation and sports===

In 1919, E.H. Maytag, the son of Maytag Appliance company founder F.L. Maytag, purchased a single Holstein cow to provide fresh clean milk to his children. Upon E.H.’s death in 1940, his sons Fred and Robert Maytag assumed leadership of the farms and Fred pursued his idea of creating a uniquely American blue cheese made from cow&#x27;s milk. Maytag Dairy Farms collaborated with Iowa State University to pioneer the first great American blue cheese that could compete with classic European cheeses such as Roquefort made from sheep&#x27;s milk. The cheese plant and caves were completed a year later and the first wheels of Maytag Blue Cheese were formed in October 1941. 77 years after Fred made the first wheels of Maytag Blue Cheese, the leadership of the company is transitioning to his grandchildren—the great-grandchildren of E.H. Maytag.

Newton has two historic movie theaters that are still in operation. The Valle Drive in is one of four drive-in theaters still in operation in Iowa. The Valle Drive in is the oldest of all of these theaters, having opened in 1948. The Capitol II Theater is located in the historic downtown district of Newton and has been in operation since April 1927; originally operating as a vaudeville theater.

Newton is home to Iowa Speedway, a 7/8-mile racing track purchased by NASCAR in 2014. It is the only short track owned by NASCAR west of the Mississippi River. The track hosts a series of races throughout the summer, including IndyCar Series, Indy Lights and ARCA Menards Series races.

Maytag Park is on the National Registrar of Historic Places. Amenities at Maytag Park include the Maytag Bowl—a historic bandshell, a public swimming pool, and a disc golf course. In addition to the City parks, Project AWAKE, a local non-profit organization, maintains the Newton Arboretum and Botanical Gardens as well as Sersland Park, a downtown park. The Newton Arboretum and Botanical Gardens occupies six acres of land and features over 150 species of trees, a rose garden, a butterfly garden, a water garden, and a native prairie.
