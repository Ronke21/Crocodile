<text>Brooklyn (popularly known as Lovejoy), is a village in St. Clair County, Illinois, United States. Located two miles north of East St. Louis, Illinois and three miles northeast of downtown St. Louis, Missouri, it is one of the oldest known black settlements in the United States. Its motto is &quot;Founded by Chance, Sustained by Courage.&quot; The mayor is Mayor Vera Banks-Glasper.

A missionary AME Church was established in the new settlement in 1836. Now known as Quinn&#x27;s Chapel AME, its congregation is believed to have supported the Underground Railroad and aided fugitive slaves to freedom, together with members of the Antioch Baptist Church established in 1838.

An early interracial community, it suffered from structural discrimination; transport lines were routed to bypass and isolate it rather than connecting it, and economic development projects passed over it, and indeed were set up in competition to it. In 2015, the county&#x27;s state attorney Brendan Kelly described the village as a &#x27;failed state.&#x27;

==History==
According to oral history tradition, by 1829 &quot;Mother&quot; Priscilla Baltimore led a group of eleven families, composed of both fugitive and free African Americans, to flee slavery in St. Louis, Missouri. They crossed the Mississippi River to the free state of Illinois, where they established a freedom village in the American Bottoms. &quot;Mother&quot; Baltimore was said to have purchased her freedom as an adult from her master. She also bought the freedom of members of her family. Born in Kentucky, she tracked her white father to Missouri and bought her mother&#x27;s freedom from him. The earliest black families included Anderson, Sullivan, Singleton, Wilson, Cox, Wyatt, and Carper.

Miranda Yancey-Bailey, an archeologist working on a 21st-century project in Brooklyn, has found written evidence that Baltimore still lived in St. Louis in the 1830s; the first documentation of her associated with Brooklyn is from 1839. She may have been traveling between these locations for a time.

Baltimore had become a Methodist preacher and participated in the religious life of the new settlement. William Paul Quinn, then a missionary of the newly formed African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), visited the settlement in 1836 and helped found the Brooklyn AME church that year. He had been assigned as a missionary that year to what was then called the Northwest, including Indiana and Ohio. Quinn was also active in planting new congregations in Kentucky and Missouri; he later became the fourth bishop of the AME Church. Brooklyn AME Church is thought to be the first AME Church west of the Appalachian Mountains. It is now known as Quinn&#x27;s Chapel AME Church in his honor.

In 1837, five white abolitionists platted the land and created an unincorporated nearly all-black town. Thomas Osburn was one of them, and he is documented as having lived in the area for decades. Priscilla Baltimore built a house on his former land, which she occupied from 1851 to 1872. In the 1840s and 1850s, the African-American population of the village was about 200.

From the beginnings of Brookyln, the ministers of the Quinn Chapel AME Church and Antioch Baptist Church (1838) used their churches as Underground Railroad stations to aid slaves escaping to freedom in Canada. William Paul Quinn and Priscilla Baltimore visited slaves in neighboring towns to inform them of the Underground Railroad&#x27;s existence, and housed slaves in the churches before sending them to the next station. At one point, Quinn was captured by Missouri slave-catchers while on a missionary tour, but presented himself as a citizen of British India and was set free. Both of these church buildings have survived.

On July 8, 1873, Brooklyn was incorporated. By 1880, its population included 371 African-American and 203 European-American residents. In the late 19th century, its residents joined in taking new industrial jobs, commuting to those in East St. Louis and nearby areas. &quot;Blacks who migrated to what became known as Brooklyn were attracted to the possibilities of working in an industrialized settlement that would enjoy race autonomy and self-determinism.&quot; In 1886, the African-American majority worked to register voters and gained political control of the village. As with most political enterprises, factions developed within the community.

Regional capital investment largely bypassed Brooklyn, taking place in the competing East St. Louis, Illinois, which gained the all-important railroad connection. Other white-majority towns also benefited by being part of the network of investment. &quot;[A]lmost none of the all-Black towns obtained a railroad.&quot; The small village soon became all black.

In 1891, then-Mayor Evans dedicated the town&#x27;s new post office with the name Lovejoy (after the abolitionist Elijah P. Lovejoy, who had been assassinated in Alton, Illinois, in 1837). The later high school was also named after him. Around the turn of the 20th century, the high school had a high reputation in the area.

===20th century===
Black autonomy did not automatically yield unity in the village. Tensions ran high with class and color conflicts by the early decades of the twentieth century, and evidence of political corruption. In addition, with the growth in number of young, single male workers, attracted to industrial jobs, the demographics changed and family life in the village declined. In 1915, two rival gangs attempting to declare themselves police chief had a shootout in front of a grocery store, resulting in three deaths. In 1933, the police chief ran an extortion ring and dissolved the city council at gunpoint, causing the county board of supervisors to replace the entire police force.

In 1940, it was reported that the town had fewer than ten white inhabitants, but the most prosperous businesses in the town were all white-owned. Furthermore, the local school had declined in quality. Black residents blamed a sense of fatalism.

Brooklyn was unaffected by the black nationalism movement in the 1960s, but in 1972, a small armed group called the United Front migrated from East St. Louis, professing a desire to create a sort of black nationalist intentional community. The mayor of the city, concerned that functions of city government might be usurped, deputized several men, who used the opportunity to gain social power in the city. Finally, in 1973, the mayor named a police chief in order to disarm the deputies, which resulted in one of them being shot dead after refusing to disarm. The chief was acquitted of murder in 1975.

With the decline of industry, from the mid-20th century on and the loss of jobs, Brooklyn has suffered high unemployment and problems similar to those of East St. Louis. It has struggled with persistent crime, and a limited economy and tax base. A cluster of bars and strip clubs provide a primary source of revenue in its limited economy. In June 2007, it was reported that three-quarters of Brooklyn&#x27;s revenue of $380,000 comes through sales tax and a $30,000 licensing fee from the adult clubs.

==Archeological and historic research==

A state archeological survey was required before construction of the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge between St. Louis and Illinois, which would require realignment of part of Rte. 3 near the village. In 2002, work revealed extensive prehistoric artifacts, so many that the researchers named the site &quot;Janey B. Goode&quot; after the popular Chuck Berry song, &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot;. This site lies within Brooklyn&#x27;s incorporated limits but just east of the historical residential part of town. It lies along the southern margin of the Horseshoe Lake meander just north of the East St. Louis Mound Group of earthworks. By the end of the 2007 field season, the team had excavated 7,000 prehistoric features, making this one of the largest sites ever excavated in the USA. Most of these features are associated with the Late Woodland Patrick phase and early Terminal Late Woodland Lloyd phase, approximately from 600 AD to 1200 AD. They suggest a more complex and dense indigenous community than researchers had known lived in the area.

In association with its work, the Illinois State Archaeological Survey (ISAS) (formerly ITARP), a joint project of the state and the University of Illinois, conducted outreach with the village of Brooklyn, volunteering to survey some of the areas associated with its early 19th-century history. A team of archaeologists led by Dr. Joseph Galloy found evidence of early Afro-American occupation from 1830 to 1850, as well as material in other areas from 1850 to 1870. This discovery suggests that the remains of Mother Baltimore&#x27;s Freedom Village survive beneath the surface in Upper Brooklyn. It also means that artifacts and other evidence of the town&#x27;s founding may be revealed if additional excavations are conducted there in the future. This would enhance the town&#x27;s historical significance and research potential.

Since the turn of the 21st century, residents have rallied around new work related to documentation of the village&#x27;s rich historical past. They have worked to collect oral histories and personal accounts of the village.
In 2007, residents founded the Historical Society Of Brooklyn, Illinois. The historical society, together with the ISAS&#x27; Drs. Joseph Galloy, Thomas Emerson and Miranda Yancey; Dr. Chris Fennell of the University of Illinois, and the Illinois State Museum, is working to preserve the history of Brooklyn.

ISAS also helped the historical society to review documents to locate &quot;Mother&quot; Priscilla Baltimore&#x27;s unmarked grave at Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis. In September 2010, the Brooklyn Historical Society installed a gravestone in her honor at the cemetery. In addition, ISAS will assist the village in surveying the Brooklyn cemetery to detect gravesites and try to document the history.

Surveys in 2008 revealed that &quot;the archaeological record of Brooklyn lies intact beneath the extensive open spaces of current-day residential parcels.&quot; In the summer of 2009, an archaeological field study began to excavate Mother Priscilla Baltimore&#x27;s freedom village. The results of this collaborative project are expected to yield material that will aid the town in gaining designation for an historic district to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2023, Landmarks Illinois added Brooklyn to 2023&#x27;s list of Most Endangered Historic Places in Illinois, listing among its threats Brooklyn&#x27;s decline in population and economy, high unemployment and low tax base, its lack of recognition for its history, and its sale of parcels to railroads that separate the community from the riverbank.

The Historical Society of Brooklyn and its collaborators are seeking national designation for three particularly significant sites: the late prehistoric Janey B. Goode archaeological site, identified as 11S1232; Brooklyn&#x27;s historic cemetery, identified as 11S1233; and Quinn Chapel A.M.E. Church. Built in 1836, Quinn Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church was the first of that newly formed, independent black denomination to be built west of the Appalachian Mountains, as well as the first in Illinois. The AME Church was founded as a denomination by free blacks in Philadelphia and its region in 1816.

<doc id="111915" wikidata="Q1025785" url="?curid=111915" title="Cahokia, Illinois">
<text>Cahokia is a settlement and former village in St. Clair County, Illinois, United States, founded as a colonial French mission in 1689. Located on the east side of the Mississippi River in the Greater St. Louis metropolitan area, as of the 2010 census, 15,241 people lived in the village. On May 6, 2021, the village was incorporated into the new city of Cahokia Heights.

The name refers to one of the clans of the historic Illiniwek confederacy, who met early French explorers to the region. Early European settlers named the nearby (and long-abandoned) Cahokia Mounds in present-day Madison County after the Illini clan. But the UNESCO World Heritage Site and State Historic Park was developed by the Mississippian culture, active here from AD 900 to AD 1500 some connection to the clan is possible but unknown. The area was part of an extensive urban complex, the largest of the far flung Mississippian culture territory through the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys.

French Canadian colonists founded Cahokia village in 1696 as a Catholic mission. The historic Church of the Holy Family is the oldest continually active Catholic parish in the United States, as well as the oldest church west of the Allegheny Mountains. Other significant colonial and Federal-period buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places include the Cahokia Courthouse (c. 1740, in the French Colonial style); and the Jarrot Mansion (c. 1810).

==History==
===Cahokia Mounds===
Archeologists ascribe the earthwork mounds Cahokia complex to the Mississippian culture, an earlier indigenous people who are not believed to have been ancestral to the Illini. The city site reached its peak in the 13th century and was abandoned centuries before European contact.

The Cahokia Native Americans of the Illinois did not coalesce as a tribe and live in the Illinois area until nearly the time of French contact 300 years ago.

===Pinet&#x27;s Mission===
Father Pinet founded a mission in late 1696 to convert the Cahokian and Tamaroa Native Americans to Christianity. Father Pinet and the Seminary of Foreign Missions of Quebec built a log church and dedicated it to the Holy Family.

===18th-century settlement===
During the next 100 years, Cahokia became one of the largest French colonial towns in the Illinois Country. It was centrally located for trading Indian goods and furs, and grew to about 3,000 inhabitants. Its thriving business district reflected a frontier society numerically dominated by needy males, as it had 24 brothels. The nearby town of Kaskaskia on the Mississippi River (founded 1703) became the region&#x27;s leading shipping port, and Fort de Chartres (founded 1718) was developed by the French as a military and governmental command center. The area of land between the two villages was cultivated by farming settlers, known as &quot;habitants&quot;, whose main crop was wheat. As settlement expanded, the relationship between the settlers and the Indians continued to be peaceful. Settlers were mostly Canadien migrants whose families had been in North America for a while.

===French and Indian War===
Cahokia declined after the French lost the French and Indian War in North America to the British in 1763, as part of the broader Seven Years&#x27; War in Europe. Only Fort Kaskaskia (built 1733) was destroyed in the conflict, and Cahokia remained regionally important for another four decades. In the treaty ending the war, France ceded large parts of what it called the Illinois Country east of the Mississippi River to the British, including the area of Canada. Many French-speaking residents of Cahokia and elsewhere in what had been Upper Louisiana moved west of the river to territory still controlled by the French rather than live under British rule. Many moved to Lower Louisiana, where they founded new Canadien villages on the west side of the Mississippi River, such as Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, and St. Louis.

The Odawa leader Pontiac was assassinated by other Indians in or near Cahokia on April 20, 1769.

===American Revolutionary War===

In 1778, during the American Revolutionary War, Virginian George Rogers Clark captured Kaskaskia and set up a court in Cahokia, making Cahokia an independent city state even though it was part of the British Province of Quebec. Cahokia (and Kaskaskia and the rest of Illinois County) officially became part of the United States by the Treaty of Paris (1783), by which the United States took over former British territory west of the Appalachian Mountains. The US soon designated this area as the Northwest Territory (and, after Ohio and Indiana became states, the Illinois Territory). Meanwhile, 105 Cahokia &quot;heads of household&quot; pledged loyalty to the Continental Congress of the United States.
===Northwest Ordinance===
After Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance in 1787 and established a governmental system for the territory, the Cahokia Courthouse was adapted for use as a United States territorial courthouse. Cahokia continued as a major political center for the next 24 years. Flood-prone Kaskaskia became the governmental seat of the Illinois Territory (1809–1818), until the territorial seat was moved to Vandalia, Illinois, and in 1809 became the county seat of Randolph County. Cahokia became the seat of St. Clair County, named by and after Arthur St. Clair, the first territorial governor. When St. Clair County was enlarged in 1801 and 1809, Governor William Henry Harrison (and later territorial secretary and acting governor Nathaniel Pope) named the Cahokia Courthouse as the legal and governmental center of a sizeable area extending to the Canada–U.S. border. By 1814, other counties and territories had been organized, and St. Clair County became its current size. The county seat was moved to the more centrally located Belleville, Illinois, (incorporated 1819 and as a city in 1850) when a local developer offered to donate land for a new county courthouse and seat.

===Annexed territory===
In the late 1950s, Cahokia annexed some population and territory, increasing its population by more than 15,000 in 1960.

==Geography==
Cahokia was located at .

According to the 2010 census, Cahokia had a total area of , of which (or 94.95%) is land and (or 5.05%) is water.

<text>Dupo is a village in St. Clair County, Illinois, United States. The population was 4,138 at the 2010 census, an increase from 3,933 in 2000. The village was settled in about 1750 and was incorporated in 1907. Its modern name, adopted in the early 20th century, is shortened from (&quot;Bridge Prairie&quot;).

==Geography==
Dupo is located at (38.515702, -90.207992). It is located in the American Bottom floodplain of the Mississippi River.

According to the 2010 census, Dupo has a total area of , all land.

== History ==
In the Mississippian period, Dupo was the site of one of several multi-mound communities in the floodplain near Cahokia. These mounds remained standing at least as recently as 1915.

The French village of Prairie du Pont was first settled around 1750 by townspeople moving out of Cahokia. It was located at a bridge over what is now known as Prairie du Pont Creek, on the trail from Cahokia to Kaskaskia, which was the first wagon road in Illinois. The settlement may have been motivated by Dupo being located 10–12 feet higher than Cahokia and thus being more protected from floods on the Mississippi River. The Sulpician mission established a mill near the bridge, which became the core of the town&#x27;s development. By 1765 fourteen families lived in Prairie du Pont. The village&#x27;s growth was further spurred by the prominent local citizen Antoine Girardin, who parceled off parts of the Cahokia commons to residents of Prairie du Pont.

The early French village at Prairie du Pont followed a tripartite system of land ownership that was common in the Illinois country: private houses in a row, &quot;common fields&quot; enclosed by a shared fence but divided into narrow strips owned and farmed by a particular family, and the actual commons used jointly by the inhabitants for grazing their livestock. The village elected a village council, or syndic, to maintain the fence around the common fields.

Among the early inhabitants of Prairie du Pont was the noted gunsmith Philip Creamer, who settled in the area in 1805. Some parts of the historic Prairie du Pont community, such as the Pierre Martin House, are now located in unincorporated North Dupo, Illinois.

A Prairie du Pont school district was established by legislative enactment in 1847, to be funded by leases of the village commons, but no school was actually held in the village until 1861, due to inadequate funds.

In the 1880s, the town of Prairie du Pont had about 50 inhabitants, of whom about 20% were African American.

The modern town of Dupo was platted in 1905 and incorporated in 1907. It grew around the Missouri Pacific Railroad switching yards. At the instigation of the railroad, the name was shortened from Prairie du Pont to Dupo.

In 1928, the Ohio Oil Company discovered oil in Dupo. This led to an oil boom in the town, in which oil wells were sunk in people&#x27;s front yards. However, the oil boom was short-lived and the economy of the town returned to depending primarily on the rail yard.

In 1997, the town considered switching its name back to Prairie Du Pont to put the industrial period behind it and better attract tourism, but ultimately left its name unchanged.

In 2019, a Union Pacific freight train derailed at the Dupo Yard, leading to the evacuation of several neighborhoods in Dupo. The crash was caused by a -long freight train breaking in half and the two halves then colliding. A tank car full of methyl isobutyl ketone caught fire.

<text>East St. Louis is a city in St. Clair County, Illinois, United States. It is directly across the Mississippi River from downtown St. Louis, Missouri, and the Gateway Arch National Park. East St. Louis is in the Metro East region of Southern Illinois. Once a bustling industrial center, like many cities in the Rust Belt, East St. Louis was severely affected by the loss of jobs due to the flight of the population to the suburbs during the riots of the late 1960s. In 1950, East St. Louis was the fourth-largest city in Illinois when its population peaked at 82,366. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 18,469, less than one-quarter of the 1950 census and a decline of almost one third since 2010.

A recent addition to the city&#x27;s waterfront is the &quot;Gateway Geyser&quot;. On the grounds of Malcolm W. Martin Memorial Park, the fountain is the second-tallest in the world. Designed to complement the Gateway Arch across the river in St. Louis, it shoots water to a height of , the same height as the arch.

==History==
Native Americans had long inhabited both sides of the Mississippi River. The Mississippian culture rulers organized thousands of workers to construct complex earthwork mounds at what later became St. Louis and East St. Louis. The center of this culture was the urban complex of Cahokia, located to the south of present-day East St. Louis within Collinsville, Illinois. Before the Civil War, settlers reported up to 50 mounds in the area that became East St. Louis, but most were lost to 19th-century development and later roadbuilding.

East St. Louis lies within the fertile American Bottom area of the present day Metro East area of St. Louis, Missouri. This name was given after the United States acquired the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, and more European Americans began to settle in the area. The village was first named &quot;Illinoistown&quot;.

East St. Louis was founded in 1797 by Captain James Piggott, a Revolutionary War veteran. In that year Piggott began operating a ferry service across the Mississippi River, connecting Illinoistown with St. Louis, which had been founded by ethnic French families. When Piggott died in 1799, his widow sold the ferry business, moved to St. Louis County and remarried. One of the Piggotts&#x27; great-great-granddaughters became known as actress Virginia Mayo (Virginia Clara Jones).

The municipality called East St. Louis was established on April 1, 1861. Illinoistown residents voted on a new name that day, and 183 voted to rename the town East St. Louis. Though it started as a small town, East St. Louis soon grew to a larger city, influenced by the growing economy of St. Louis, which in 1870 was the fourth-largest city in the United States.

===Great Railroad Strike of 1877===

A period of extensive industrial growth followed the American Civil War. Industries in East St. Louis made use of the local availability of Illinois coal as fuel. Another early industry was meatpacking and stockyards, concentrated in one area to limit their nuisance to other jurisdictions.

In the expansion, many businessmen became overextended in credit, and a major economic collapse followed the Panic of 1873. This was due to railroad and other manufacturing expansion, land speculation, and general business optimism caused by large profits from inflation. The economic recession began in the East and steadily moved West, severely crippling the railroads, the main system of transportation. In response, railroad companies began dramatically lowering workers&#x27; wages, forcing employees to work without pay, and cutting jobs and paid work hours. These wage cuts and additional money-saving tactics prompted strikes and massive unrest.

While most of the strikes in the eastern cities during 1877 were accompanied by violence, the late July 1877 St. Louis strike was marked by a bloodless and quick takeover by dissatisfied workers. By July 22, the St. Louis Commune began to take shape, as representatives from almost all the railroad lines met in East St. Louis. They soon elected an executive committee to command the strike and issued General Order No. 1, halting all railroad traffic other than passenger and mail trains. John Bowman, the mayor of East St. Louis, was appointed arbitrator of the committee. He helped the committee select special police to guard the property of the railroads from damage. The strike and the new &quot;de facto&quot; workers&#x27; government, while given encouragement by the largely German-American Workingmen&#x27;s Party and the Knights of Labor (two key players in the organization of the Missouri general strike), were run by no organized labor group.

The strike also closed packing industry houses surrounding the National Stock Yards. At one plant, workers allowed processing of 125 cattle in return for 500 cans of beef for the workers. Though the East St. Louis strike continued in an orderly fashion, across the river in St. Louis there were isolated incidents of violence. Harry Eastman, the East St. Louis workers&#x27; representative, addressed the mass of employees:

The strikers held the railroads and city for about a week, without the violence that took place in Chicago and other cities. The federal government intervened, and on July 28 US troops took over the Relay Depot, the Commune&#x27;s command center, and the strike ended peacefully.

=== Great Cyclone of 1896 ===

On May 27, 1896, a tornado struck St. Louis and East St. Louis. It stands as the deadliest tornado to ever hit the cities. In approximately 20 minutes, this tornado resulted in destruction that killed 137 people in St. Louis and 118 in East St. Louis. The tornado&#x27;s destruction spanned , including the railyards and commercial districts of East St. Louis. During the storm, 311 buildings were destroyed and 7,200 others were severely damaged. The cost of this loss was estimated to be between $10 million and $12 million. In 1896 this was a considerable amount of money, as a two-story brick house could be purchased at that time for $1,500.

===East St. Louis riots of 1917===

East St. Louis in 1917 had a strong industrial economy boosted by America&#x27;s economic participation in demands related to World War I; although war was declared in April, the nation did not meaningfully enter the war until that fall. Industry was dominated by European immigrant workers, who had been coming to industrial cities since the late 19th century. Here and across the country, they repeatedly tried to organize in efforts to gain better wages and working conditions. In the summer of 1916, 2,500 white workers struck the nearby meat packing plants of National City. Companies recruited black workers, sometimes importing them from the South. While the white workers won a wage increase, the companies retained some black workers, firing white ones. Such economic competition raised tensions between the groups in a period when the number of blacks in East St. Louis had increased dramatically due to the first Great Migration, when African Americans left poor rural areas of the South to escape Jim Crow oppression and seek jobs in the industrial cities of the North and the Midwest. From 1910 to 1917, the black population nearly doubled in East St. Louis.

The United States established a draft which would bring in many workers to the military. As the war prevented immigration from Europe even before the U.S. entered the war, major companies had begun to recruit black workers from the South to fill demand. When white workers went on strike in April 1917 at the Aluminum Ore Company, the employer hired blacks as strikebreakers. The American Steel Company also recruited blacks. They were available in part during this period because the U.S. Army initially rejected many black volunteers in the years before an integrated military. This was also the period of resentment on both sides and the arrival of new workers created fears for job security at a time of union organizing and labor unrest, and raised social tensions. At a large labor meeting of white workers held in City Hall on May 28, men also traded rumors of fraternizing between black men and white women. An inflammatory speaker said, &quot;East St. Louis must remain a white man&#x27;s town.&quot; Three thousand ethnic white men left the meeting and headed as a mob for downtown, where they randomly attacked black men on the street. The Illinois governor called in National Guard to prevent further rioting, but rumors circulated that blacks were planning an organized retaliation and tensions remained high.

On July 1, 1917, a black man allegedly attacked a white man. After hearing of this, whites drove by black homes near 17th and Market and fired shots into several of them. When police came to investigate a gathering of a large group of local black residents, their car was mistaken for that of the attackers, and several in the crowd at 10th and Bond fired on the police, killing two detectives. The next morning, thousands of whites mobbed the black sections of the city, indiscriminately beating, shooting and killing men, women and children. The rioters burned entire sections of the city and shot blacks as they escaped the flames. They also hanged several blacks. They destroyed buildings and physically attacked people; they &quot;killed a 14-year-old boy and scalped his mother. Before it was over 244 buildings were destroyed.&quot; Other sources say 300 buildings were destroyed.

The city had 35 police officers, but they were seen to be doing little to suppress the violence. The governor called in National Guard troops to try to control the situation; they arrived July 3, but several accounts reported that they joined in the rioting. Most of the violence ended that day, but reports continued afterward of isolated assaults of blacks. Afterward the city Chamber of Commerce called for the resignation of the Police Chief and greater oversight of police operations. Losses in property damage were high, including railroad warehouses and carloads full of goods that were burned, as well as railroad cars.

Though official reports suggested that the East St. Louis race riot resulted in the deaths of 39 blacks and 9 whites, other estimates put the figure much higher, with estimates of 100 to 250 blacks being killed.

W. E. B. Du Bois of the NAACP came to investigate the riots personally. His organization&#x27;s photographer published photos of the destruction in the November issue of &quot;The Crisis&quot;. Congress also held an investigation.

In New York City on July 28, 10,000 black people marched down Fifth Avenue in a Silent Parade, carrying signs and protesting the East St. Louis riots. The march was organized by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), W. E. B. Du Bois, and groups in Harlem. Women and children were dressed in white; the men were dressed in black.

===20th century===
East St. Louis continued to have an economy based on industry. Through and after World War II, many workers could make decent livings. It was named an All-America City in 1959 by the National Civic League. East St. Louis celebrated its centennial in 1961. It was known as the &quot;Pittsburgh of the West&quot;. Its population had reached a peak of 82,366 residents in the 1950 census, the fourth-largest city in Illinois at the time.

Through the 1950s and later, the city&#x27;s musicians were an integral creative force in blues, rock and roll and jazz. Some left and achieved national recognition, such as Ike &amp; Tina Turner. The jazz great Miles Davis, who became internationally known, was born in nearby Alton and grew up in East St. Louis. The 1999 PBS series &quot;River of Song&quot; featured these musicians in its coverage of music from cities along the Mississippi River.
The city suffered from the mid-century restructuring of heavy industry and railroads, which caused widespread loss of jobs. As a number of local factories began to close because of changes in industry, the railroad and meatpacking industries also were cutting back and moving jobs out of the region. This led to a precipitous loss of working and middle-class jobs. The city&#x27;s financial conditions deteriorated. Elected in 1951, Mayor Alvin Fields tried funding measures that resulted in raising the city&#x27;s bonded indebtedness and the property tax rate. More businesses closed as workers left the area to seek jobs in other regions. The more established white workers had an easier time gaining jobs in other localities, and the city population became increasingly black. &quot;Brownfields&quot; (areas with environmental contamination by heavy industry) have made redevelopment more difficult and expensive.
Street gangs appeared in city neighborhoods. Like other cities with endemic problems by the 1960s, violence added to residential mistrust and adversely affected the downtown retail base and the city&#x27;s income.

The construction of freeways also contributed to East St. Louis&#x27; decline. They were constructed through and broke up functioning neighborhoods and community networks, adding to the social disruption of the period. The freeways made it easier for residents to commute back and forth from suburban homes, so the wealthier people moved out to newer housing. East St. Louis adopted a number of programs to try to reverse decline: the Model Cities program, the Concentrated Employment Program, and Operation Breakthrough. The programs were not enough to offset the loss of industrial jobs due to national restructuring.

In 1971, James E. Williams was elected as the city&#x27;s first black mayor. Faced with the overwhelming economic problems, he was unable to make much of a difference. In 1975, William E. Mason was elected mayor; his term marked a return to patronage politics and the city sank deeper into debt and reliance on federal funding. In 1979, Carl Officer was elected as mayor (the youngest in the country at that time, at age 25). Despite hopes for improvement, conditions continued to decline. Middle-class citizens continued to leave the city. People who could get jobs moved to places with work and a decent quality of life. Lacking sufficient tax revenues, the city cut back on maintenance, sewers failed, and garbage pickup ceased. Police cars and radios stopped working. The East St. Louis Fire Department went on strike in the 1970s.

Structure fires destroyed such a significant number of consecutive blocks that much of the post-Armageddon film &quot;Escape from New York&quot; was filmed in East St. Louis.

In 1990, the State of Illinois passed (65 ILCS 5/Art. 8 Div. 12) The Financially Distressed City Law. Under this law, Illinois Governor James R. Thompson provided $34 million in loans to East St. Louis, with the stipulation that an appointed five-member board, called the East St. Louis Financial Advisory Authority, manage the city&#x27;s finances. In 1990 the state legislature approved riverboat gambling in an effort to increase state revenues. The opening of the &quot;Casino Queen&quot; riverboat casino generated the first new source of income for the city in nearly 30 years.

In 1991, Gordon Bush was elected mayor. Several major industries operating in the area had gained separate incorporation as jurisdictions for the land where their plants are sited. These &quot;communities&quot; have virtually no residents, and the shell jurisdictions are outside the tax base of East St. Louis (See: Sauget, Illinois). Residents of the city, however, suffer from contaminated air and other adverse environmental effects of these sites. At the same time, the city&#x27;s tax base is too poor for it to maintain its infrastructure, including the sanitary sewers, many of which have broken and overflowed in residential neighborhoods and schools.

===21st century===

Since 2000, the city has completed several redevelopment projects: in 2001 it opened a new library and built a new city hall. Public-private partnerships have resulted in a variety of new retail developments, and housing initiatives. The St. Louis MetroLink light rail connects the city by transit to St. Louis, which has a stronger economy, and such efforts have sparked renewal.

Because of depopulation, the city has many abandoned properties and extensive urban blight. Sections of &quot;urban prairie&quot; can be found where vacant buildings were demolished and whole blocks have become overgrown with vegetation. Much of the territory surrounding the city remains undeveloped, bypassed by developers who chose more affluent suburban areas. Many old &quot;inner city&quot; neighborhoods abut large swaths of corn and soybean fields or otherwise vacant land. In addition to agricultural uses, a number of truck stops, strip clubs, and semi-rural businesses surround blighted areas in the city.

Over 2,200 people, or over 12% of the remaining population, live in public housing owned by the East St. Louis Housing Authority. All of these residents make less than $9,000 per year, meaning the Authority is highly dependent upon state and federal funding to continue operating its aging housing stock.

In 2010, the East St. Louis community gardening movement began to develop plots for &quot;urban farming&quot;, as has been done in North St. Louis. Inspired by Detroit&#x27;s planned use of vacant land for green development, community associations, nonprofits and universities have collaborated to spark green development in East St. Louis.

===Archeological remains===
In the early 1990s, archeological surveys and excavations prior to construction of Interstate 55/70 revealed evidence of important prehistoric structures in the East St. Louis area. Both sides of the river had earlier been reported as having numerous earthwork mounds when Europeans and Americans first settled in the area. Unfortunately, most of these cultural treasures in St. Louis and on the east side were lost to development.

Illinois researchers discovered the remains of several earthwork mounds. In the East St. Louis area, 50 mounds had been mapped before the Civil War, and seven remain visible today. The largest is estimated to have been originally high and would have nearly covered a football field. Around the remains of this mound, researchers have discovered evidence of burial mounds, a large plaza, a wooden defensive palisade and several other Mississippian culture structures. These indicate that it was a ritual center. The prehistoric site is now called the East St. Louis Mound Center. The state and University of Illinois are trying to develop coordinated projects with East St. Louis and businesses to use the mounds and artifacts as attractions for heritage tourism.

It was built by the Mississippian culture, which extended throughout the Ohio and Mississippi valleys. It reached its peak in this region about AD 1100–1200 at the nearby major center of Cahokia, a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site within the present-day boundaries of Collinsville. A complex urban center estimated to have had a population of perhaps 20,000, this site is about from East St. Louis.

In 2012, archeological work prior to construction of the Stan Musial Bridge across the Mississippi discovered artifacts and evidence of a formerly unidentified 900-year-old suburb of Cahokia in present-day East St. Louis. This site had not been mapped in the 19th century, and was unknown. The Mississippian culture site is in a present industrial wasteland. Researchers found evidence of more than 1,000 dwellings and the base of an earthen pyramidal mound. It would have been one of dozens of mounds when the community was active, based on the size of the residential population of this site. Discovery of the site led scholars to increase their estimates of the total population of the Mississippians at Cahokia and in the area, now thought to have been about 20,000. They did not have the time to excavate the entire area. It is on private land and subject to risk of destruction by development.

==Geography==

East St. Louis is located at (38.616, −90.133).

On July 14, 1954, the temperature in East St. Louis allegedly reached , the highest temperature ever recorded in America east of the Mississippi River. It is not considered a formal record, however, as the city had no weather station.

Interstate 55, Interstate 64, Interstate 70, and U.S. Route 40 run through East St. Louis and are linked to St. Louis by the Poplar Street Bridge and Stan Musial Bridge. Prior to its decommissioning, the fabled U.S. Route 66 also shared a concurrency with these Interstate highways. In addition, U.S. Route 50 also shared a concurrency prior to its being rerouted to run concurrently with Interstate 255.

The closest airport is the St. Louis Downtown Airport located in nearby Cahokia, Illinois, just south of East St. Louis.

===Fire department===
The city of East St. Louis is protected by 31 paid, professional city firefighters. They are organized into three divisions of operations: Administration, Firefighting/Hazard Mitigation, and Fire Prevention/Arson Investigation. The department operates from three fire stations in the city: Engine 422 at 17th St. and Lincoln Ave., Engine 425 and Ladder 419 at 17th St. and Central Ave., and Engine 426 at 72nd St. and State St. The Chief of Department is Jason Blackmon.

The East St. Louis Fire Department has struggled to provide protection and service while having to undergo repeated budget cuts due to city problems. It laid off some 22 firefighters in May 2013. According to a National Fire Report, approximately 49 percent of all emergency calls the East St. Louis Fire Department responds to are structural fires.

==Education==
The city is served by the East St. Louis School District 189. As of 2017, the district operates an early childhood learning center, 5 elementary schools, 2 middle schools, and one high school, East St. Louis High School.

There are two private K–8 schools in East St. Louis: Sister Thea Bowman Catholic School and Unity Lutheran Christian Elementary School. Sister Thea Bowman Catholic School is operated under the Roman Catholic Diocese of Belleville. There were previously four Catholic elementary schools: St. Joseph, St. Martin of Tours, St. Patrick, St. Philip, Holy Angels and St. Adalbert. In 1989 they consolidated at the St. Philip location as Bowman.

<text>Freeburg is a village in St. Clair County, Illinois, United States. Located within Greater St. Louis, it is a southeastern exurb with many residents commuting to Downtown St. Louis or the Belleville area for employment. , Freeburg had a population of 4,354.

==History==
Freeburg lies in the fertile and rolling southern Illinois plains between the Kaskaskia and Mississippi Rivers. It was platted in 1836 as the town of Urbana by immigrants to this area from Virginia around 1800. The first European settlers of Freeburg were of English and Irish ancestry.

There were five migratory Native American tribes that crisscrossed each other in Illinois; the Peorias, Cahokias, Kaskaskias, Tamaroas, and Michiganics. It is said that Turkey Hill to the north of town was a popular Native campground that also attracted many early settlers because of the view it provided of the surrounding countryside. The last Indian tribes left this area by 1820.

Attracted by the abundance of coal, the availability of cheap and fertile farmland, as well as the proximity to the frontier city of St. Louis, which was located only 20 miles to the northwest of the area, large-scale German migrations to the area began around 1830 and continued at a consistent rate for the rest of the century.

The old &quot;Plank Road&quot; was built in the 1850s, and, for 35 cents, travelers could ride from Belleville to Freeburg in &quot;comfort&quot; without potholes on what is now known as the old Freeburg Road. Abraham Lincoln is said to have used this road on at least one occasion.

In 1851, the post office came, and when it was found that there was another town of Urbana in Illinois, the city fathers changed the name in 1859 to Freeburg after the city of Freiburg in the region of Baden, Germany, from which some of the early settlers had come.

The town was incorporated in 1867 with 808 residents. The railroad came in 1869 and exchanged owners several times before being sold to the Illinois Central.

In the heyday of independent coal mines, as many as 1500 miners lived here, and in 1874, there were 10 hotels for them to choose from if they could not find more permanent lodging. With the closing of the Peabody River King Mine just east of Freeburg in 1989, coal no longer played a dominant role in the local economy.

The River King Mine Train at Six Flags St. Louis was named for the River King Coal Mine located in Freeburg. The 2,000-acre mine site was operated by Peabody Coal (now named Peabody Energy) from 1957 to 1989. After the closure of the large mine in 1989, Peabody donated some 1,800 acres of the 2,000-acre site to the Illinois Department of Natural Resources in 1994. The site is now the state owned and managed Peabody-River King State Fish and Wildlife Area and is open to the public for use by anglers, hunters, and other outdoor enthusiasts for recreational opportunities in the southeastern portion of Greater St. Louis.

Today, Freeburg remains a community with a highly diversified business economy that also serves as a bedroom community for Belleville and the St. Louis metroplex, while still providing essential services needed in any small community.

<text>Marissa is a village in St. Clair County, Illinois, United States. The population was 1,979 at the 2010 census.

==History==

Before 1700, the Marissa area was inhabited by various Native American tribes. Among them were Kaskaskias, Peorias, Cahokias, Iroquois, and Michiganies. However, the most prevalent in the immediate area were probably the Tamaroas. It is known that just south of Marissa Cemetery, on a hill at 321 Doza Creek Road, a settlement existed as many artifacts have been recovered over the years. Also, there are still the remains of a trail that was used by the tribes as they traveled east and west. Evidence of this can still be seen just north of the dwelling at 132 Doza Creek Road. The three feet deep trench running through the woods was worn by foot and horse traffic, some pulling two pole skids carrying possessions. During the early 1700s, settlers first made their appearance in the region. French hunters and trappers ventured into the area in quest of its plentiful game. One of the first was Elexe Doza, who gave his last name to a creek that lies just south of the village.

The first settlers came to the area around 1805. John Lively had moved his family here from South Carolina and built a log cabin about two miles east of Marissa near Risdon School Road. A second family moved into the area four years later and they too were followed by others. The encroachment of the Indians’ land had begun and, as could be expected, conflicts began to surface. Because of the hostilities, small wooden forts were built by the settlers that afforded them a place to retreat when threats of attack loomed. One of these was constructed on Doza Creek about a ¼ mile north of where it is crossed by the Risdon School Road. Crumbling remains of the fort were reportedly still in existence in the early 1960s, but were destroyed by strip mining. A steady stream of settlers continued, and in 1818, Illinois was granted statehood. The first elementary school opened in the area in 1831.

Starting in the late 1800s and continuing to the present day, one of the largest local industries has been the mining of steam coal. Currently most of the coal mined here is burned to generate electricity.

<doc id="111928" wikidata="Q575435" url="?curid=111928" title="Mascoutah, Illinois">
<text>Mascoutah is a city in St. Clair County, Illinois, United States. The population was 8,754 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Metro East region of Greater St. Louis. The city was named for the Mascoutens, a tribe of Algonquian-speaking Native Americans.

== History ==
The town of Mascoutah was originally established in 1837 as Mechanicsburg. This was disputed with the establishment of a Post Office; the inhabitants were informed that another township in Illinois was already named Mechanicsburg. The town was renamed after the Mascouten tribe, and was officially designated Mascoutah in 1839.

Mascoutah was considered a progressive town near the turn of the 20th century. The town saw steady growth thanks to the construction of a train depot in 1870, courtesy of the St. Louis and Southeastern Railway (later the Louisville and Nashville). The largest Turner Hall in Southern Illinois was established in Mascoutah in 1873 which served as the center of town social life, and the town constructed its own citizen owned power plant in 1894. The Mascoutah Herald was established in 1885 and remains in production to this day. In 1903 the Belleville And Mascoutah Electric Railway Company planned an electric rail system to Belleville that was delayed and never completed.

The train depot shut down, the Turner Hall eventually became the chamber of commerce, and the municipal power plant now houses the city&#x27;s fleet and equipment maintenance department.

<text>Millstadt is a village in St. Clair County, Illinois, United States, located at the crossing of Illinois Routes 163 (locally, &quot;Jefferson Avenue&quot;) and 158 (locally, &quot;Washington Avenue&quot;). The village is known for its German heritage, with more than half its people of German descent. The population was 4,011 at the 2010 census, but a more recent study in July 2018 estimated the number at 3,885.

==History==
During a barn raising in 1836, it was proposed that a town be incorporated on land belonging to Henry Randleman. The name &quot;Centerville&quot; was proposed, as the site was equidistant from Belleville, Columbia, and Pittsburg Lake. The town was platted on March 13, 1837. In 1880, its name was changed to Millstadt, as the name Centreville was in use by another nearby town.

Another account (Millstadt School website): &quot;The story of how Millstadt developed out of &#x27;Centerville&#x27; goes something like this. The current Centreville and our Centerville each had a post offices through which a great deal of mail became confused and mis-delivered. Our town&#x27;s forefathers, upon applying for formal organization through the state, supposedly decided on the name &#x27;Mittlestadt&#x27; or &#x27;Middlestadt,&#x27; which means literally &#x27;center city&#x27;; somehow the state misread the writing and sent back the papers reading &#x27;Millstadt.&#x27; As you can guess, the governing group decided to keep that name as we had several mills at that time and the name fit.&quot;

In 1874, a German immigrant farm family was killed in a farming hamlet known as Saxtown, just south of the town. It made national headlines and became the subject of the book The Ax Murders of Saxtown.

<text>::&quot;See also Athens, Illinois and Athens (disambiguation) for more places called &quot;Athens&quot;.&quot;

New Athens () is a village in St. Clair County, Illinois, United States. Based upon common usage, the &#x27;A&#x27; is always sounded with a long vowel, rather than a short vowel, by its residents, unlike the most commonly used English pronunciation of the city in Greece.

The population was 2,054 at the 2010 census. New Athens sits on the Kaskaskia River and was originally called Athens. The village was laid out in 1836 and incorporated in 1866. The name change to New Athens came in 1868 after it was discovered there was already an Athens in another part of the state.

The area is known for the water sports recreation, including annual fishing derby. It is also the home of the Peabody River King Conservation Area.

Since New Athens is in the Metro East area of greater St. Louis, it also has a place in the local brewery history. New Athens was home to Mound City Brewery until the 1950s. Baseball is a major sport in the area and the village has produced a number of athletes who have played professionally. One of the favorite sons is Whitey Herzog, a former Major League Baseball outfielder and manager. Other former major leaguers with New Athens ties include Larry Stahl, Mickey Haefner, Warren Hacker and Rich Hacker.

New Athens is home to several churches, including St. Agatha Catholic Church, St. John United Church of Christ, St. Paul Lutheran Church, The United Methodist Church of New Athens, and First Baptist Church.

The first organized settlement in what would later become the future town of New Athens, Illinois was Manville Ferry named after early settler and ferryman on the Kaskaskia River, Ira Manville. Manville ran the ferry until his death in 1821. By 1818, the third generation of the Sturdivant family counterfeiters, known as the &quot;Sturdivant Gang&quot;, were organized by Roswell S. Sturdivant and his brother, Merrick Sturdivant, who led the criminal organization, would base their southwestern Illinois counterfeiting operations at Manville Ferry and the other part of their criminal operation in southeastern Illinois on the Ohio River at Sturdivant&#x27;s Fort, in Pope County, Illinois, now present-day Rosiclare, Hardin County, Illinois.

<text>O&#x27;Fallon is a city in St. Clair County, Illinois, United States. The 2020 census listed the population at 32,289. The city is the second largest city in the Metro East region of the St. Louis metropolitan area and Southern Illinois. It sits from Scott Air Force Base and from Downtown St. Louis.

Like its namesake in St. Charles County, Missouri, O&#x27;Fallon is part of the St. Louis metro area. This makes O&#x27;Fallon (along with the two Troys in Illinois and Missouri) one of the few pairs of like-named municipalities to be part of the same metro region.

==History==

Founded in 1854, O&#x27;Fallon&#x27;s namesake comes from Colonel John O&#x27;Fallon who was a wealthy gentleman from St. Louis. In downtown O&#x27;Fallon, a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad railroad depot was built, which helped put O&#x27;Fallon on the map. City lots were platted and sold at a public auction on May 18, 1854. A post office was established the following year and the city began attracting German settlers looking for fertile farming land. On January 27, 1874, O&#x27;Fallon was incorporated as a village. On March 14, 1905, the citizens voted for a change to the city form of government. Since its founding, O&#x27;Fallon has gained population every decennial census year except 1930, when the census showed a net loss of six residents.
The city center is approximately two miles east of the intersection of Interstate 64 and U.S. Route 50. Suburban growth in O&#x27;Fallon expanded considerably during the 1980s and following the expansion of Interstate 64 in the 1990s. Subdivisions include Thornbury Hill, Nolin Creek Estates, Fairwood Hills, Deer Creek, Forest Hills, and Fairwood East. O&#x27;Fallon Township High School&#x27;s main campus at 600 South Smiley Street has undergone numerous additions over the past decades to ease overcrowding, including the creation of the separate 9th Grade Milburn Campus.

O&#x27;Fallon&#x27;s city seal was designed in 1974 by Michael Donovan, an OTHS freshman, during a contest held by the O&#x27;Fallon Junior Woman&#x27;s Club to create a city flag. In May 1975, the design was finalized by Louis Bradshaw and was then adopted by the city as its official flag. According to the 2004 publication by the O&#x27;Fallon Historical Society, &quot;O&#x27;Fallon Sesquicentennial History&quot;: &quot;The design is yellow gold on a blue background—the colors of the high school. The pick and shovel represent the coal mines that were so important to O&#x27;Fallon&#x27;s economy for over 100 years. The locomotive represents the railroad to which O&#x27;Fallon owes its existence. The planes represent Scott Air Force Base where many in O&#x27;Fallon find employment—both military and civil service.&quot;

<text>Sauget ( ) is a village in St. Clair County, Illinois, United States. It is part of Greater St. Louis. The population was 141 at the 2020 census, down from 159 in 2010.

==Geography==
Sauget is located at (38.587013, -90.166690).

According to the 2010 census, Sauget has a total area of , of which (or 92.08%) is land and (or 7.92%) is water.

Sauget is located in the American Bottom, the floodplain of the Mississippi River opposite St. Louis, Missouri.

==History==

Sauget was incorporated as &quot;Monsanto&quot; in 1926. It was formed to provide a lighter regulatory environment and low taxes for Monsanto chemical plants at a time when local jurisdictions had most of the responsibility for environmental rules. It was renamed in honor of Leo Sauget, its first Village President.

The village was incorporated in part in response to the failure of government in adjacent East St. Louis, Illinois to deliver essential services, and in part to take advantage of federal grant funding programs available only to governmental units, as opposed to private industry.

The village of Sauget operates the American Bottoms Treatment Plant, a large sewage treatment plant that serves much of the Illinois side of the St. Louis metropolitan area. In addition, the village operates a municipal physical/chemical treatment plant that receives industrial wastewater from its factories. This has been cited as one of only three municipal treatment plants of this type in the United States.

The Monsanto plant in Sauget was the nation&#x27;s largest producer of PCBs before a 1977 ban, and the EPA has designated the plant site along Dead Creek as a Superfund site.

Sauget has its own 16-member fire department and 16-member police department; this is despite having a population below 250 people. There is roughly one officer and firefighter for every 15 residents in Sauget. Sauget supplies municipal water and wastewater services.

Sauget is also home to minor league baseball: the Gateway Grizzlies of the Frontier League, which are controlled by the Sauget family.

Located in Sauget is the National Building Arts Center, a historic preservationist and salvage organization which holds one of the largest collections of significant architectural and industrial elements in the US.

==History==
A site known as &quot;Three Springs&quot; for its geological characteristics hosted an 11-day revival camp meeting in April 1807, which was the first in St. Clair County and possibly the second in Illinois Country, which was then part of Indiana Territory. It was organized by the Rev. William McKendree, Presiding Elder of the Western Conference and 4th Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church.

This assembly inspired construction of the log Shiloh Meeting House on the site shortly afterward, being the first Methodist church in the county and second in the Illinois Country. This meeting house came to be the longest-organized United Methodist church in the state of Illinois, bequeathing its name to the village and township which grew up around it. Three members of this church played significant roles in state government in the effort to prevent slaveholding from gaining a foothold in Illinois.

<doc id="111938" wikidata="Q1641936" url="?curid=111938" title="Swansea, Illinois">
<text>Swansea is a village in St. Clair County, Illinois. It is a part of the St. Louis metropolitan area and Metro East in southern Illinois. It is surrounded by the communities of Fairview Heights, Belleville, O’Fallon, and Shiloh. The population was 13,430 at the 2010 census, an increase from 10,579 in 2000.

== History ==

In the late 19th century the area that is now Swansea was a mix of farming and commerce. It was home to underground coal mines, foundries, brickyards, and the Gundlach Drill Works, manufacturers of the most efficient grain drills of that era. The early residents were fiercely independent and bent on conducting their own affairs. When the municipality that sat on their doorstep reached out to annex their lands and businesses they decided to start their own community.

On November 27, 1886, a group of 35 area residents petitioned the county government &quot;that they are desirous of having said territory organized as a village...That the name of the proposed village shall be New Swansea.&quot;

The residents voted on December 16, 1886, to form their own community and name it “New Swansea”. A petition for annexation to the city of Belleville was being circulated in the territory. Establishing an independent community was a quick and effective method of avoiding annexation. And so a new municipality was incorporated on December 20, 1886. In 1898 the lot at the corner of Brackett and Illinois Streets was purchased for $300. The Village Hall was completed shortly thereafter at a cost of $619.50.

<doc id="111947" wikidata="Q202828" url="?curid=111947" title="Freeport, Illinois">
<text>Freeport is the county seat and largest city of Stephenson County, Illinois, United States. The population was 23,973 at the 2020 census, and the mayor of Freeport is Jodi Miller, elected in 2017. Freeport is known for hosting the second Lincoln–Douglas debate of 1858, and as &quot;Pretzel City, USA&quot;, due to a popular local German bakery that became well known for its prolific pretzel production after it opened in 1869. Freeport High School&#x27;s mascot is the Pretzel to honor its heritage.

==History==
The community was originally called Winneshiek. When it was incorporated, the new municipality took its name from the generosity of Tutty Baker, who was credited with running a &quot;free port&quot; on the Pecatonica River. The name &quot;Winneshiek&quot; was later adopted, and is preserved to this day, by the Freeport Community Theatre Group.

In 1837, Stephenson County was formed and Freeport became its seat of government in 1838. Linked by a stagecoach with Chicago, the community grew rapidly. In 1840, a frame courthouse was erected and the first school was founded. Within two years, Freeport had two newspapers and in 1853, the two were joined by a third which published in German. By then, the community had a population of 2,000.

On August 27, 1858, the second debate between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas took place in Freeport and gave the nation direction in the following years. Although Stephen Douglas won the election and retained his U.S. Senate seat, his reply to a question on slavery alienated the South, which called it the &quot;Freeport Heresy&quot;, and split the Democratic Party. This enabled Abraham Lincoln to win the Presidency in 1860.

A monument to the debate was dedicated in 1903 by President Theodore Roosevelt and stands at this site. A life size statue recreating the event was dedicated in 1992. Another renowned statue, &quot;Lincoln the Debator&quot; by Leonard Crunelle, is a focal point in the city&#x27;s Taylor Park. In many years there is also a reenactment of the debate, which has been shown on C-SPAN.

Freeport is known as the &quot;Pretzel City&quot;, and its public high school&#x27;s team is named the Pretzels. The nickname is a reminder of Freeport&#x27;s ethnic heritage: in the late 1850s, many Germans, both from Pennsylvania and from their European homeland, resettled in Stephenson County bringing with them their love of pretzel snacks. In 1869, a German immigrant named John Billerbeck established the Billerbeck Bakery, which distributed so many pretzels to residents that the local newspaper later dubbed Freeport the &quot;Pretzel City&quot;. The city later capitalized on this nickname in 2003 by starting Freeport&#x27;s first Pretzel Festival.

Before February 1893, a large square of land was purchased from the former Keller-Wittbecker farm in East Freeport. Some of this land had been subdivided and platted as the &quot;Arcade Addition&quot;, as Arcade Manufacturing used some of that square of land in 1893 to rebuild its factory after a fire in its original location had destroyed everything. The Arcade Manufacturing Company had been in operation since 1885 when the previous Novelty Iron Works had gone out of business at the corner of Chicago and Jackson streets. That earlier company began as early as 1868. After the 1892 fire, the Arcade Manufacturing Company built an entirely new factory in the Arcade Addition of East Freeport, where they produced coffee mills and other metal products.

Freeport is home to the oldest Carnegie Library in Illinois and one of the first Carnegie Libraries designed by the Chicago architectural firm of Patton and Miller. It was renovated into Freeport&#x27;s city hall and city offices were moved to Carnegie City Hall in February 2017.

The City of Freeport transitioned to the city manager form of government in May 2017.

==Geography==

U.S. Route 20 is a four-lane divided highway that skirts the community&#x27;s northern edge.

===Climate and flooding===
The Pecatonica River has flooded Freeport seven times since May 2017. The necessary flood cleanup has cost the city more than $1.5 million.

The frequency of severe weather events appears to be increasing. According to the State Climatologist, &quot;the number of days Freeport has experienced heavy rainfall has steadily increased every decade since 1949.&quot; The city is seeking funding to buy out homes in flood-prone neighborhoods. One study estimates that for &quot;every $1 communities like Freeport spend to relocate their residents they will save $6 in future clean ups.&quot;

<text>Lena is a village in Stephenson County, Illinois. The population was 2,772 at the 2020 census.

Lena was platted in 1853, and named after a place mentioned in a poem by Ossian.

==History==

In 1853, a railroad survey by Benjamin Dornblazer determined a course through present-day Lena. Samuel F. Dodds, who owned of land in the area, purchased an additional tract of on behalf of the railroad company and grading work was begun. Dodds owned a stone residence which still occupies Lot No. 1 on Lena Street, while Dr. F. Voightheld owned a log home (which has subsequently been demolished) near the train depot. At the time, these two buildings made up the extent of the town.

The town was originally shaped as a parallelogram covering twenty-six blocks for a total of 304 housing lots. During the summer of 1853, lots sold rapidly, commanding prices varying from $50 to $150 each. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1854, track was laid, and railway cars began running between Freeport and Warren. The population began to grow, mostly with English and Irish residents. In 1854, there were about a dozen families in Lena.

During the summer of 1855, Reber &amp; Cheney and Dodds erected a three-story brick building at the corner of Railroad and Schuyler streets. It was completed in the fall of 1856 at a cost of about $4,000. The building is still used by local businesses. The Panic of 1857 had little effect on the growth of the town, and rapid expansion continued through 1860.

As growth continued after the Civil War, the first town newspaper called the &quot;Lena Star&quot; was established in 1867, with Dodds as editor. During its first year, the newspaper reported a local fire and called for a town water pump. Several fires erupted through 1868, and J.M. Shannon (who took over as editor of the newspaper) continued calls for a pump. The Lena Water Tower was finally established on May 15, 1868.

By 1870, Lena&#x27;s population had reached 1,295 people and its social and business community continued to grow. The Lena Fire Department was established in 1869 and officially met for the first time in 1870. Despite the presence of the fire department and well, fires continued to plague Lena. During the early 1870s, structure fires consumed a warehouse, a stable, a rural school and several Lena houses. News of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 was unsettling to the residents of Lena, and a fire of 1874 nearly destroyed the old railway depot and freight houses.

A local opera house, constructed in 1879, was featured on the History Channel show &quot;American Pickers&quot; in February 2010. The Opera House, now reconstructed, was closed in 1938.

<doc id="111951" wikidata="Q2671866" url="?curid=111951" title="Orangeville, Illinois">
<text>Orangeville is a village in Stephenson County, Illinois, United States. The town&#x27;s sign lists the population at 800 as of January 2021. The population in 2020 was 738. The population according to the 2010 census was 793, up from 751 in 2000. Using the 2020 population of 738 Orangeville is the 741st largest city in Illinois and the 11,650th largest city in the United States. Orangeville is currently declining at a rate of -0.94% annually and its population has decreased by -6.94% since the 2010 census. The area&#x27;s earliest white settlers arrived in the year 1833, and the village was platted in 1851 by John Bower, who is considered the village founder. In 1867 Orangeville was incorporated as a village. The town&#x27;s central business district contains several 19th century commercial buildings, many of which were built during the railroad boom of 1888–1914. By the time the Great Depression was ongoing, business in Orangeville had started to decline, with the last bank closing in 1932. In 1956 another bank started operating in the village and is still in town today. Some recent infrastructure jumps have restored some of the village&#x27;s old decor.

Orangeville is about two miles (3 km) south of the Illinois – Wisconsin border and about west of Rockford, Illinois. Orangeville is located directly off of Illinois Route 26 between Monroe, Wisconsin and Freeport, Illinois. The town itself is located in farmland surrounded by vale and rises from Richland Creek on its west end, down High Street and into the central business district, where the Central House hotel occupies the highest lot. Public education in Orangeville is the responsibility of Orangeville Community School District #203 which previously operated an elementary school on the south side and a combination junior and senior high school on the east side. In 2019 the district combined the elementary school with the joint high school on the east side to create the Orangeville High School. The previous elementary school was converted to a multi-family complex.

==History==

===Early history===
Before 1837, the area was occupied by Native Americans who utilized it for hunting grounds; the Sioux tribe had a camp near Oneco. Game that populated the Orangeville area included buffalo and deer. John H. Curtis purchased the of land, which included the area that would eventually become Orangeville, on January 1, 1838, at the United States General Land Office in Dixon. Curtis constructed a dam on Richland Creek, and on the creek&#x27;s west bank erected a gristmill and a saw mill. Curtis died in 1843 and both mills stood idle until John Bower arrived in 1846, with his family, after having visited the area the year before. Bower purchased the and the mills.

Throughout the 1830s and 1840s farmers from New York and Pennsylvania, known as the Pennsylvania Dutch, arrived to settle the area around present-day Orangeville. Of the first 14 settlers to the area, 13 were Pennsylvania Dutch, the 14th was a German immigrant. A Dr. Thomas Van Valsah led a wagon train from Pennsylvania to Stephenson County in 1837.

The village of Orangeville was founded by John Bower, popularly confused as &quot;Bowers.&quot; Bower came to Stephenson County in 1845 and, on October 16, 1846, bought the land that would be platted as Orangeville from for $950. Bower built the Union House in 1849 on a portion of what became Orangeville in 1851. Though the town was platted by Bower in 1851, it was not incorporated until 1867. A drawing of the plat was done by surveyor Marcus Montelius and indicated that Orangeville has always been known as Orangeville; several publications have asserted that the town began as Bowersville or Bowers Mills and underwent a name change in 1854. It is possible that the incorrect name Bowersville was a misremembered version of &quot;Bower&#x27;s mill&quot;. The plat also showed 48 original town lots.

At the outset, Bower brought &quot;wagon loads&quot; of lumber from Galena and Chicago to the settlement, and by 1849 he had reconstructed and improved the gristmill. The mill was completed in 1850 at a cost of $8,000. Charles Moore, who would become the first President of the village when it was incorporated, came to the town, lured by Bower&#x27;s efforts, in 1849. George Hamilton built a store and soon farmers began to build houses, by 1850 a stagecoach served the area. In September 1852 construction began on Orangeville&#x27;s first church.

By 1854, Orangeville was in competition with the village of Oneco as a growing center of commerce. That year, the federal government decided that population growth in the two villages warranted the establishment of a post office. On an appointed day, residents of both villages lined up on the sides of the street according to which town they supported as the location for the post office. Orangeville won by a narrow margin.
===Arrival of the railroad===
After its incorporation the village continued to prosper, the downtown district was mostly complete by the 1870s, with all commercial lots purchased and improved. Mel Trotter who established a chain of rescue missions during his lifetime, was born in the village on May 16, 1870, and lived there until he was five years old when his family moved to Polo, Illinois. By 1877, the village population was up to 300 and in 1883 the &quot;Orangeville Alert&quot;, the first village newspaper, was established. In 1887, the Illinois Central Railroad decided to link Freeport to Madison, Wisconsin. The only incorporated village along that line was Orangeville, the railroad came in 1888 and led to commercial building boom. This building boom directly resulted in 14 new buildings being erected downtown, all brick buildings downtown save the 1906 Wagner Building and the 1899 R.W. Moore Building were a result of the railroad. Between 1888 and 1914, numerous business developed along the corridor of Main and High Streets, those included: restaurants, drug stores, barber shops, banks, watch and clock repair shops, cigar factory, funeral parlor and casket factory, among several others.

===Great Depression===
In 1928, just before the onset of the Great Depression, Illinois State Highway 74 (later Illinois Route 26) was rerouted through the eastern part of Orangeville, bypassing the downtown business district. Though the downtown district no longer had a major thoroughfare passing through it, many of the business were able to survive, at least initially. By 1928, the decline in the business community of Orangeville was evident; the bypass, coupled with the depression continued to negatively affect the village. In 1932, the People&#x27;s State Bank, the last open bank in Orangeville, closed its doors.

==Geography==

Orangeville is located at (42.466900, -89.646003). According to the 2010 census, Orangeville has a total area of , all land. The village of Orangeville is located in northern Stephenson County, about two miles (3 km) south of the Illinois-Wisconsin border directly off of Illinois Route 26. The village is south of Monroe, Wisconsin, north of Freeport, west of Rockford and east of Dubuque, Iowa.

The village is located in a vale which is surrounded by farmland. At the western end, and lowest end, of town Richland Creek runs north–south and is paralleled by the old Illinois Central Railroad bed. The railroad bed is now part of the Jane Addams Trail. High Street, which runs through the historic downtown is the primary east–west route through the village and Main Street, which intersects High Street at its highest point, becomes Freeport Road and leads to the city of Freeport.

==Cityscape==
The central business district is along High and Main Streets, and forms downtown Orangeville. High Street slopes uphill from the Richland Creek and is populated by historic, 19th century buildings. At the summit of High Street&#x27;s slope is the Central House, which is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. In total, four of the five structures on the National Register in Orangeville, are found along High Street; the Union House and the Orangeville Masonic Hall are the other two. Other historic buildings in the approximately three block area include the 1888 Musser Building, and the 1906 Wagner Building.

The first commercial brick building to be constructed in the main business district was the Central House, which operated as a hotel from its construction during the 1860s until its conversion to a single family residence in the 1930s. All other buildings were erected around Central House, which was specifically located and designed to be the center piece of downtown Orangeville. The People&#x27;s State Bank was the last major commercial building constructed in historic downtown Orangeville. In 1932 People&#x27;s State Bank closed its doors. In 1956 Community Bank of Orangeville opened for business in the downtown area. In 1980 Community Bank moved to the current church street location on the south end of town. Community Bank of Orangeville is the village&#x27;s only operating bank.

in 2020, the old Elementary School located on East St. was converted to a 33,000 sq ft. Multi-Family apartment building. The renovations include 20 studio apartments with utilities as well as common areas.

==Culture==

===Social and fraternal organizations===

Social and fraternal organizations have played a major role in the community and the social history of Orangeville. There have been several organizations in Orangeville throughout its history and in 1876 the local Ancient Free and Accepted Masons (AF and AM) Lodge erected the Orangeville Masonic Hall. Though the building was originally constructed to serve as the meeting hall for the local AF and AM Lodge, from its opening it has always been used by all of Orangeville&#x27;s fraternal organizations.

The Orangeville AF and AM Lodge 687 was chartered October 1, 1872, and its sister organization, Eastern Star, Willow Chapter #434 was founded in 1899. The group held its meetings on the second floor of the Masonic Hall and the first floor was reserved for entertainment and social functions. The Lodge is still active in Orangeville today. The Orangeville Independent Order of Odd Fellows, (IOOF) J.R. Scruggs Lodge 372 was formed on October 18, 1868. The Orangeville IOOF Lodge assisted the March 10, 1896, establishment of their sister organization, the Rebekah Lodge. The IOOF has faced dwindling membership and, in 2002, the Orangeville chapter had less than 50 members.

Orangeville Lodge No. 133 of the International Organization of Good Templars was established in 1867, as a temperance lodge, but it soon dissolved. Other short-lived lodges include the Grand Army of the Republic Lodge, Modern Woodmen of America, and various other temperance lodges. Regardless of their longevity, each of these groups met in the same Orangeville Masonic Hall.

As of late 2014, Orangeville became famous for receiving the Guinness World Record for world&#x27;s tallest dairy cow. The cow&#x27;s name is Blosom and is a resident at the Hanson Farm.

<text>East Peoria is a city in Tazewell County, Illinois, United States. The population was 22,484 at the 2020 census. East Peoria is part of the Peoria metropolitan area, located across the Illinois River from downtown Peoria. It is home to many Caterpillar Inc. facilities.

The city is the site of the Par-A-Dice Hotel and Casino, as well as the city&#x27;s major business center, the Levee District. Located just east of the Illinois River, East Peoria has many points of access to and from the Peoria area. It is also the location of the Festival of Lights, an annual Christmas light display that runs from November to January and draws thousands of visitors from all over central Illinois.

== History ==
Several years after Illinois became a state (which happened December 18, 1818), William Blanchard and three other men (Charles Sargeant, Theodore Sargeant, and David Barnes) crossed Fort Clark (located in Peoria) to the eastern side of the Illinois River. The land here was a swampy floodplain; nevertheless, they made their claim on the land and built huts, growing corn and tomatoes in the fertile soil. This settlement was originally named &quot;Fondulac Township&quot;, with &quot;fondulac&quot; meaning &quot;bottom of the lake&quot; in French.

Over the course of a few years, more settlers arrived. Jacob L. Wilson, Thomas Camelin, and a man simply known as &quot;Donohue&quot; established themselves in the new township, with Wilson eventually becoming the Justice of the Peace.

On June 14, 1855, a petition to plat the Town of Fondulac was filed with Tenth Judicial Circuit Court by Seth Abbott. This plat showed three streets—Mill Street, Main Street, and Depot Avenue—in addition to a saw mill, a cording mill, and a portion of the Peoria &amp; Oquawka Railroad. By 1857, the Peoria &amp; Oquawka Railroad was completed as far east as Chenoa, and the town received and sent farm products by rail. In February 1864, an additional plat of land was laid out for a town named &quot;Bluetown&quot; by William C. Cleveland, who was the Tazewell County Surveyor. This plat showed four streets: Peoria Street, Bloomington Street, Vine Street, and Sycamore Street. The petition for this plat was filed by Joseph Schertz and accepted April 1, 1864. The origins of the name &quot;Bluetown&quot; are claimed to be from Joseph Schertz, who &quot;always wore blue smocks at their work.&quot;

On July 1, 1884, citizens of both Fondulac and Bluetown held a referendum at the public school to propose both towns be incorporated as one. This proposition passed by a vote of 30–12, and the two towns were merged into the Village of Hilton. There is no official origin behind the new name, but there is a connection with the Hilton Coal &amp; Iron Mining Co. at the eastern end of town. On August 4, the first village Board of Trustees was elected. Nicholas Slagle was named the first president, and he appointed Thomas J. Floyd and Joseph Moseman as the village clerk and treasurer, respectively. Peter Schertz, H.F. Cappo, J.G. Vogelgesang, Samuel Allen Sr., and Edward Lange Sr. were elected to the board as well.

The village existed as Hilton for five years. In October, 1889, the name was changed to the &quot;Village of East Peoria&quot;, since it was east of the city of Peoria. The name underwent a final change in April 1919, when it became the &quot;City of East Peoria&quot;.

=== Manufacturing ===

==== Peoria Brick Company ====
Among the natural resources available to extract were clay and shale—important for brickmaking. While numerous small brickmaking plants were scattered around East Peoria in the 1880s, F.R. Carter Brick Yard (later known as Peoria Brick &amp; Tile, and Peoria Brick Company) would sustain itself to the present. In 1899 Frederick R. Carter purchased the Spurck Paving Brick Plant, manufacturing paving and building bricks and shipping them via the Lake Erie &amp; Western Railroad. In the beginning, the brick yard had 60 employees and could produce up to 40,000 bricks a day. In 1909, Carter expanded the business to include an additional plant on Cole Hollow Road; the new location featured 10 dome-like brick kilns that were 30 feet in diameter and 16 feet tall. In addition, Carter purchased Rapp Clay Products in April 1925. Subsequently, Carter decided to close the original plant and had all brick manufacturing occur at the Cole Hollow Road location. By 1939, the company increased daily production to 65,000 bricks a day. They also transitioned from fuel sources such as coal and wood to gas, and used electricity to operate machinery rather than horsepower.

Although brick manufacturing ceased in 1982, the company has diversified its offerings in accordance with community needs. Now, they offer a wide variety of masonry and landscaping materials and have a much broader customer-base. Tom said, &quot;Approximately 40 percent of our sales come from landscaping. You have to have diversity in order to stay with the times&quot;. In May 2013, Peoria Brick &amp; Tile was renamed to Peoria Brick Company and expanded again by opening a new location in Mossville, Illinois.

The business has remained under the Carter family&#x27;s management since its creation. Frederick&#x27;s sons Charles, Raymond, and Ben, and Frederick&#x27;s son-in-law Harry Maw, joined him in operating the plant. In 1966, the son-in-law of Charles, Thomas J. Carney, purchased the company. Thomas&#x27; son Tom Carney Jr. said, &quot;After my grandfather, Charles Carter, passed away in 1964, the business transferred to my mother, Jane Carter, and father, Tom. I started in 1970, and my sister, Mary Pat Turner, and her husband Steve started in 1978. They retired in 2010&quot;. As of 2023, Tom Carney Jr., his daughter, and his son-in-law maintain operations.

==== Caterpillar Inc. ====
The Holt Manufacturing Company in Stockton, California, had successfully built crawler-type tractors and in 1909 began looking for manufacturing facilities closer to the vast agricultural markets in the Midwest farm belt. Company President Benjamin Holt dispatched his nephew, Pliny E. Holt in March 1909 to find another plant. He met Murray Baker, an implement dealer, who knew of a factory already equipped to manufacture farm implements and steam traction engines that had belonged to the bankrupt Colean Manufacturing Co. of East Peoria.

Pliny inspected the Colean factory and learned Colean had spent at least $450,000 on the relatively new building and machinery. Holt bought the assets on October 25, 1909, for the $50,000 note held by a trust company. and began operations on February 15, 1910 with 12 employees. The &quot;Holt Caterpillar Company&quot; was incorporated in both Illinois and California on January 12, 1910. East Peoria became Holt Manufacturing Company&#x27;s eastern manufacturing plant, competing with the nearby Avery Tractor Company. Holt was credited with producing the first practical continuous tracks for use with tractors and he registered &quot;Caterpillar&quot; as a trademark in 1911.The Peoria facility proved so profitable that only two years later the Peoria facility employed 625 people and was exporting tractors to Argentina, Canada, and Mexico. In April and May 1925, after a period of financial difficulty, the financially stronger C. L. Best merged with the market leader Holt Caterpillar to form the Caterpillar Tractor Co. Clarence Leo Best assumed the title of CEO, and remained in that role until October 1951. The new company was headquartered in San Leandro until 1930, when under the terms of the merger it was moved to Peoria. The Caterpillar company consolidated its product lines and went on to supply the Allied armies with artillery tractors during World War I, the first use of crawling type tractors for military purposes.

When World War I broke out, with the problem of trench warfare and the difficulty of transporting supplies to the front, the pulling power of crawling-type tractors drew the attention of the military. In British trials, the Holt tractor was found to be better suited than its competitors to haul heavy loads over uneven ground. The War Office was suitably impressed and chose it as a gun-tractor. Holt Caterpillar tractors were also the inspiration for the development of the British tank, which profoundly altered ground warfare tactics.

=== Par-A-Dice Hotel and Casino ===

Par-A-Dice Hotel and Casino is a riverboat casino located on the Illinois River off Illinois Route 116/U.S. Route 150 in East Peoria, Illinois, United States. Originally opened in 1991 in Peoria, it moved to East Peoria in 1993. While it was established through investors, Boyd Gaming purchased the casino in 1996 for $175 million USD.

From 1991 to 1999, Par-A-Dice cruised the river daily, until Illinois removed the requirement for riverboat casinos to leave their docks. This was reversed in June 2010 with the new U.S. Coast Guard annual requirement, and the riverboat set off along the river for the first time in 11 years.

In 2020, East Peoria’s adjusted gross revenue from casinos dropped by 34.6% from $74.5 million to $48.7 million USD.

=== Levee District ===
The main commercial area of East Peoria is the Levee District. Located just across the river from downtown Peoria, it is a mixed-use project with a wide variety of restaurants, shopping malls, and accommodations. For the bulk of the 1900s, the area was a Caterpillar manufacturing site. In 1998, it was razed to the ground and all that remained was a concrete slab. The land was bought by the city for redevelopment in 2000, creating an opportunity to transform the industrial downtown into a commercial hub. East Peorians previously would have to travel to Peoria for dining and shopping; with the creation of the Levee District, residents could do so locally. A range of both national and local restaurants can be found in the Levee District.

In concert with the renovation of remaining Caterpillar buildings, the development of the downtown Peoria Riverfront Museum and Caterpillar Visitor&#x27;s Center, and the renovation of Interstate 74 and of the area&#x27;s bridges, East Peoria&#x27;s downtown and urban area have developed substantially.

== Arts and Culture ==

=== Fondulac District Library ===
The Fondulac District Library was established with the help of the East Peoria Woman&#x27;s Club in 1935. Since then, it has moved locations several times to accommodate the increased usage and size of the collection. The collection includes Playaway devices, magazines, board games, puzzles, Roku players, and Wi-Fi hotspots.

==== April 2013 Flood ====
On April 17, 2013, East Peoria was among the communities impacted by the flooding from heavy storms. Water was high enough to strand vehicles and the soil was so waterlogged that mudslides occurred. That evening, a leak was discovered at the library. The water was cleaned up and the leak was presumed to be fixed. The next morning, the basement of the library had filled with several thousands of gallons of water. While the majority of the collection was safely transported upstairs intact, the walls, carpet, and furnishings were damaged, along with the computers. The library did not reopen to the public until April 24, 2013.

==== New Building and Relocation ====
In April 2009, residents of East Peoria approved a referendum to build a new library in the present-day Levee District. In June 2012, ground was broken to begin the construction. This library is approximately 32,000 square feet, and features a larger collection of media than previous libraries. The library opened to the public on November 1, 2013.

The library shares an atrium called the Civic Complex with East Peoria City Hall, which was built on other side in 2015. The library has a circulation department and children&#x27;s department on the first floor, while adult services, reference, and local history are on the second. In addition, there are public computers and several study rooms available for use on the second floor.

Levee Park features a reading garden that was dedicated to the library in 2018. It features seating with umbrellas for shade, as well as landscaping, a water fountain, and a Free Little Library. Costing $500,000 USD to construct, it was paid for entirely through private donations to the East Peoria Community Foundation.

=== Festival of Lights ===
Beginning after Thanksgiving and ending in the first week of January, the city holds a Christmas light event known as the Festival of Lights. Started in 1984, it was initially a Parade of Lights, in which floats decorated in Christmas lights were driven through town. In 1986, the pencil-steel E.P. Noel Riverboat debuted. It appeared to be very popular with the city, so each float ever since has been made with pencil steel. As lighting effects improved over the years, animated features have been added to the floats.

In 1993, the Winter Wonderland drive-through was constructed. All of the floats and displays stay here for the duration of the festival, and receive about 25,000 visitors annually.

From 1984 to 2013, The Festival Wreath was a Ferris wheel with fluorescent light tubes attached to its frame. In 2014, a new Festival Wreath replaced it with a welded frame, 80 tube-shaped lights, 1,000 lightbulbs, and rope lights. It sits on top of Fon du Lac Drive, overlooking the city.

The symbol for the Festival of Lights is a little wooden toy soldier named FOLEPI (pronounced FO-LEE-PEE), which stands for Festival of Lights, East Peoria, Illinois.

In 2020, the Festival of Lights was named Heavyweights Champion on ABC TV’s &quot;The Great Christmas Light Fight&quot;.

== Parks and recreation ==
East Peoria Park District has over . Carl Spindler Marina Campground overlooks the Illinois River. Fon du Lac Farm Park, Splashdown Water Park, and Recreational Courts and Skate Park are other recreational areas. In 2018, Splashdown was torn down leaving East Peoria without a pool.

East Peoria has two golf courses: Fon du Lac Golf Course and Quail Meadows.

=== Levee Park ===
Levee Park, a green space right behind Fondulac District Library, is being developed. Initially just a grassy island, construction has been taking place to convert it into a more engaging place for citizens to visit since 2018. The plan consists of three phases, with the first phase dedicating a reading garden to the library, and the second phase involving the installation of outdoor restrooms and utility lines. The city plans to add a splashpad and a sheltered amphitheater as part of the third and final phase. The project has been entirely funded by grants and donations. A portion of the final phase is paid for through an Open Space Land Acquisition and Development (OSLAD) grant. This grant was awarded to 87 parks across 31 counties for a total of $30.3 million USD.

== Sports ==
The EastSide Centre is a sports complex located on the eastern side of town. It features facilities for several sports, such as basketball, baseball/softball, soccer, lacrosse, as well as a walking track and gymnasium.

The complex is used as a venue for primary, secondary, and college athletic events. It is a regular host to IHSA’s State Softball Championships and IESA’s State Track and Baseball Finals, and the Robert Morris–Peoria Eagles baseball and club football team use the facility.

==Education==
East Peoria is serviced by a Head Start, three school districts, and a local community college.

=== Primary and Secondary Education ===
There are multiple elementary school districts covering the city. They include: East Peoria School District 86, Creve Coeur School District 76, and Robein School District 85. Those areas in turn are zoned to East Peoria Community High School District 309. Two other elementary school districts, District 50 Schools and Central School District 51, cover parts of the city and feed into Washington Community High School District 308. Small portions are zoned to Morton Community Unit School District 709.

Details:
* Tazewell-Woodford Head Start; a federally funded early childhood education, nutrition, health, and parent involvement program for low-income families
* East Peoria Elementary School District 86; three K-2 schools, three 3rd-5th grade schools, and one 6th-8th grade junior high school
* Robein School District 85; one K-8 grade school in the Robein neighborhood of East Peoria
* East Peoria Community High School District 309; one 8th-12th grade high school (East Peoria High School)
* Creve Coeur School District #76, a K-8 school, feeds into East Peoria Community High School.

=== College Education ===

Located at the northeastern edge of the city, Illinois Central College (ICC) is a community college with campuses in East Peoria, Peoria, and Pekin. ICC serves all or parts of ten central Illinois counties: Peoria, Tazewell, Woodford, Bureau, Logan, Marshall, Livingston, McLean, Stark, and Mason.

In September 1965, a referendum to authorize a taxy levy in order to establish a community college was circulated around town. In May 1966, central Illinois residents approved it by a margin of 16,870-8,421. The educational district, Community College District #514, would become Illinois Central College by November 10, 1966. In the autumn of 1967 the college&#x27;s first semester started, with Dr. Kenneth L. Edwards as president, 56 full-time faculty employed, and 2,486 students enrolled. In the 1970s, student enrollment increased to 9,000 and the college expanded its services to include an academic and business program oriented campus in downtown Peoria. By the 1990s, the college further expanded the campus in Peoria and built the Caterpillar Service Training Building. The addition of this building demonstrated the collaborative relationship of the college, the local community, and the manufacturing industry. In 2009, the Pekin campus was opened.

The college offers a wide variety of programs, including those that award certificates, are transferrable, or offer degrees. For example, some transferrable programs include Pre-Med, Pre-Law, Journalism, and Education. The college also has programs that focus on workforce development and GED certificates.

== Media ==
&quot;The Pilot&quot; served as East Peoria&#x27;s first newspaper, beginning publications on September 13, 1901, by A.R. Zimmerman – its lead story celebrated East Peoria&#x27;s first paved road. &quot;The Pilot&quot; was followed by the &quot;East Peoria Post&quot;, which was published weekly in the 1910s-1920s. In 1927, the progenitor of the city&#x27;s current newspaper began circulating. It was named &quot;East Peoria Courier&quot;, and was founded by Aaron K. Brill, who was well-known for his work in the &quot;Peoria Star&quot;. In 1956, &quot;East Peoria Courier&quot; was purchased by the Tazewell Publishing Company, and was renamed the &quot;Tazewell Courier&quot; until 1980, when it reverted back to &quot;East Peoria Courier.&quot; In 1997, the newspaper changed its name once more to the &quot;East Peoria Times-Courier&quot;.

East Peoria is home to the majority of the commercial television broadcast outlets that serve the Peoria area. WEEK-TV, channel 25, the local NBC affiliate, has long maintained studios and transmitter facilities on Springfield Road in East Peoria. In recent years, other stations have moved in with WEEK-TV as a result of operations mergers through local marketing agreements, including MyNetworkTV affiliate WTVK (channel 59), and ABC affiliate WHOI (channel 19), which moved to the Springfield Road studios in 2009 from its former location in nearby Creve Coeur. The remainder of Peoria&#x27;s TV stations maintain their studios across the river in Peoria.

<text>Goodfield is a village in Tazewell and Woodford counties in Illinois. The population was 936 at the 2020 census, up from 686 at the 2000 census. Goodfield is part of the Peoria, Illinois, Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The site of Goodfield was surveyed for John Guth of Washington, Illinois, on August 29, 1888. The name &quot;Goodfield&quot; is believed to derive from &quot;Guthville&quot; (via &quot;Goodville&quot;), named after John Guth.

===2019 Fire===
The area of the village gained local, national, and global notoriety when a 9-year-old boy allegedly set fire to a trailer that contained his mother and several other relatives, killing five, including at least one or two young children who were relatives. The fire was, after some time, determined to be suspicious by the coroner and fire investigators and area police. The boy, who as a young juvenile cannot be named (there is, after the mother gave an interview, also a court-imposed gag order on all parties), is subsequently being prosecuted on five first degree murder charges and aggravated arson resulting in death. The boy, taken from his mother after the fire, is a ward of the state, and his grandparents are now his legal guardians. His initial appearance was before Judge Charles Feeney, who took careful time to explain the charges and their meaning. Under Illinois law, those under 10 cannot be detained except for brief questioning, and those under 13 cannot be detained in a juvenile facility or juvenile detention center. They must be at least 16 to be transferred to adult court. He will face probation for a minimum of five years but not after age 21, restitution and/or some form of service, and intensive therapy, counseling, and rehabilitation. He is the youngest to be charged in central Illinois since at least 2006, especially for such a serious offense that in adult could bring life without parole in the non-death penalty state.

<text>South Pekin is a village in Tazewell County, Illinois, United States. The population was 996 at the 2020 census and is part of the Peoria, Illinois Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

South Pekin was incorporated on April 12, 1917, five miles south of Pekin in an area previously known as &quot;McFadden Flats&quot;. The village is located in Sections 27 and 34 of Cincinnati Township, which was formed in 1850. South Pekin began as a railway station on the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad (C&amp;NW).

Settlement began in the 1820s in the South Pekin area when white settlers arrived in the future Tazewell County. The railroad constructed its line from Nelson, Illinois to Peoria in 1901. In 1904, C&amp;NW discovered a large coalfield near Staunton in Macoupin County. A few years later, C&amp;NW decided to build a line of access to the coal field and carry freight between Chicago and St. Louis. By March 1912, the right of way had been purchased and construction was started. C&amp;NW needed a water, refueling, and repair station midway on the new line. The first choice for the location of this new station was Green Valley, Illinois, but residents protested and the railroad selected South Pekin as the site of the new station.

Al Casper was the first permanent resident; he arrived with his family on December 25, 1912. More families arrived and the railroad gave them boxcars to use as homes on a location that was known as McFadden Flats. The village of South Pekin was laid out in Cincinnati Township on July 10, 1913 and incorporated on April 12, 1917.

The economic possibilities that came with the railroad caused business leaders in Pekin to be very interested to pull the switch yard closer and get the new &quot;railroad people&quot; with steady work and good pay in their town. Ultimately most employees opted to settle close to the yard which was already located in South Pekin. In addition to the numerous blue collar jobs the C&amp;NW operation also brought management positions and erected a three-story masonry office building (which was demolished near the beginning of the 21st century). South Pekin was a home terminal for Chicago and Northwestern Railroad crews in the twentieth century. Trains were made up in the middle of the town in a &quot;Kick&quot; Yard. After the trains were put together, crews would get on the train and proceed south to East St. Louis or north to Nelson, where they would be relieved and allowed to sleep for the next tour of operation. The Chicago and Northwestern also maintained a bunkhouse in South Pekin where crews could stop for the night. In the 1970s train crews would go onward through Nelson and proceed to Proviso (a suburb of Chicago) or to Clinton, Iowa. At times there were as many as 20 trains per day either made up at South Pekin or that went through South Pekin.

South Pekin has been a home to a recording studio called The Golden Voice Recording, owned and operated by Jerry L and Mary Anne Milam. The studio was in operation from 1966 to 1978. A fire that was believed to be arson destroyed the recording studio in 1978.

===Disasters===
South Pekin has seen its share of disasters, starting with flooding during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. The town&#x27;s worst disaster was the F3 tornado of March 30, 1938, that destroyed much of South Pekin and killed nine of the village’s residents; it remains the deadliest tornado in Central Illinois over 85 years later. National Weather Service research suggests the storm was a super-cell that spawned up to five tornadoes. On May 9, 1995 another tornado rated F1 moved northeast across town, destroying several garages and destroying a railroad barracks. Two injuries and around one million dollars in damage was reported. On May 15, a tornado touched down just south of town that would later hit Tremont. On May 10, 2003, South Pekin was again hit by a tornado. The tornado touched down three miles southwest of town around 9:45 P.M. and crossed Highway 29 into the village at F3 intensity. It went through the village at 9:50 PM and was about a quarter mile wide. There were 23 injuries in South Pekin but no fatalities. The town was rebuilt over the next ten years and constructed a new tornado warning system.

<text>Tremont is a village in Tazewell County, Illinois, United States. The population was 2,277 at the 2020 census. Tremont is located 14 miles southeast of Peoria.

==History==
James Chapman settled in the Tremont area in 1820, followed by William Sterling, William and James Broyhill, Michael Trout, and David Lackland. Margaret E. Lackland was the first to be born in the new settlement. A post office was established in 1835 and the first postmaster was Wiliam Sampson. Josiah James and J. H. Harris laid out the village, built a school house, and built a church. Tremont was governed under district control until March 11, 1835, when it was organized as a town.

=== Courthouse ===
Tremont became the seat of Tazewell County in 1836. John Harris donated 20 acres of land, and the citizens raised $2,000 to bring the county seat to the town. The two-story red brick courthouse was 40 by 60 feet with Grecian columns and an octagonal cupola topped with a weathervane. Construction began in 1837 and completed in 1839. Due to a political rivalry, the county seat transferred back to Pekin in 1849.

Tremont was also host to Abraham Lincoln during his travels as a lawyer before his advancement into higher office. Lincoln visited the Tremont Courthouse in 1842; here, James Shields challenged him to a duel. Lincoln last spoke in Tremont on August 30, 1858. A marker now stands in commemoration of the courthouse.

<text>Washington is a city in Tazewell County, Illinois, United States. Washington is on U.S. Route 24 and Illinois Route 8, northeast of East Peoria. The population was 16,071 at the 2020 census, a 48.2% percent increase over 2000. It is a suburb of Peoria and is part of the Peoria Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Washington was founded in 1825 by William Holland Sr., who came from North Carolina and was hired by the U.S. government to provide blacksmith services to the local Native Americans. During his long and eventful life, he was married three times, and was the father of twenty-one children: fourteen by his first wife and seven by his second wife. He had eighty-two grandchildren and fifty great grandchildren. He died in Washington on November 27, 1871, at the age of ninety-one. The post office (and later the city) was originally named Holland&#x27;s Grove in 1833 before being renamed in honor of the first U.S. president, George Washington, in 1837.

In the 1920s, a man named George Heyl put Washington on the map as the home of the famous Heyl Pony Farm. Some of the original barns still exist on North Main Street. The Heyl Pony Farm supplied Shetland ponies to buyers around the world; George Heyl also raised pure bred poultry. When Heyl died suddenly in 1932, it was recorded as one of the largest funerals ever held in Washington.

Another local site of interest is the &quot;old canning factory&quot;, which is now occupied by American Allied Railway Equipment Company Inc. In 1943, the canning factory (which after the war was run by the Libby&#x27;s company) had a shortage of workers, and the government needed K rations and canned goods to feed the troops. So 50 captured German soldiers from the prisoner of war camp known as Camp Ellis in Fulton County were brought in. The Washington sub-camp was first commanded by Colonel John S. Sullivan, and later by Captain T. A. Cox. The POWs were brought in on the old rail line that ran down Wood Street (the foundation of a sentry tower can be seen just northeast of the intersection of Wood and Jefferson near the entrance to the bike trail). They were trucked from the camp to various local farms to help with the pumpkin harvest. The prisoners were allowed no visitors, nor could residents speak to the prisoners. An exception was made for local ministers, such as Pastor Kammeyer from St. Mark&#x27;s Lutheran who spoke fluent German and ministered to the POWs spiritual needs.

A new community center, named Five Points Washington, opened in October 2007. The facility houses the Washington Public Library, a performing arts center, swimming pools, fitness center, and banquet center.

===2013 tornado===

An EF4 tornado, part of the tornado outbreak of November 17, 2013, entered Washington from the southwest in East Peoria. Three people were killed, one during the storm and two others later from injuries, including a United States Army veteran.

<doc id="111973" wikidata="Q559296" url="?curid=111973" title="Anna, Illinois">
<text>Anna is the largest city and retail trade center in Union County, Illinois, United States. Located in Southern Illinois, its population was 4,303 at the 2020 United States Census, a decline from 5,135 in 2000. It is known for being tied to its close neighbor Jonesboro, together known as Anna-Jonesboro, and of which the main public high school for the two towns is named. Anna is known for the Choate Mental Health and Development Center, a state facility that opened in 1869.

==History==

Anna was platted on March 3, 1854, after the new Illinois Central Railroad established a station there. It was founded by Winstead Davie and named after Anna Davie, his wife. It was then incorporated on February 16, 1865.

The coming of the railroad can be credited for prompting the founding of the City of Anna, although, from the time of the George Rogers Clark expedition into Southern Illinois country, emigrants recognized its agricultural possibilities. 
Centrally located in Anna Precinct of Union County, Anna was established by ordinance following the election of Trustees in 1855, although the plot was recorded in the county records on March 3, 1854. The area&#x27;s elevation and fertile soil have made fruit farming—particularly the growth of grapes for winemaking—one of the area&#x27;s principal businesses. For the purpose of farming, fruit growing, gardening, and dairying, the lands in and around Anna are not surpassed in Southern Illinois. The precinct in which Anna lies is situated on the divide between the waters of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and is well drained by the Cache, Cypress, and Big Creeks. Many cool springs of water aid materially in cattle farming in this area.

In 1859, brothers Cornwall and Wallace Kirkpatrick started Anna Pottery in Anna. Their work became well-known and later, collectors&#x27; items; one of their most descriptive pieces was a pig from which wine could be consumed. The business ran until 1900, according to an exhibit at the Union County Historical Society Museum in Cobden.

During the American Civil War, Camp Anna in 1862 was the mustering and training location for some Illinois Infantry regiments, including the 81st, 109th, and 110th. There have been various commemorations ever since, including: 2013 and 2022.

Sentiments in Union County for the north and south were clearly divided during the war. Contemporary newspapers were blatantly political. The Anna Democrat continued publication, while the Jonesboro Gazette was denied its constitutional right to freedom of the press from 15 May 1863 until it was allowed to resume publication on 5 March 1864. The newspapers were consolidated to form &quot;The Gazette-Democrat&quot; on 26 October 1939.

Anna is home to the Union County Fair, which began in 1880.

In 1909, town residents attempted to drive out the black families who lived in Anna, after the lynching of William &quot;Froggie&quot; James in the nearby town of Cairo, Illinois, for the alleged rape and murder of Anna resident Anna Pelley. Anna was historically a sundown town, in which African Americans were excluded from living in the town&#x27;s limits. Though the town was named after Anna Davie, the wife of the town&#x27;s founder, some outsiders believed that the town&#x27;s name was an acronym for &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Niggers Allowed&quot;. The town has become infamous for it by its portrayal in literature and film. The phrase is still well-known, with few non-white residents owing in part to its historical reputation. Signs using a pejorative for Black people warning them not to let the sun go down on you in Anna persisted on Highway 127 until the 1970s.

The Stinson Memorial Library is a public library located at 409 South Main Street in Anna, Illinois. The library was designed by Walter Burley Griffin, an understudy to Frank Lloyd Wright, in 1913 and constructed in 1913–14. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 9, 1978.

Lewis Bakeries, the makers of Bunny Bread, was founded in 1925. Lewis started the company with a $300 loan against his mother&#x27;s house, and by 1987, the company was reportedly earning $80 million in annual sales. Founder Jack Lewis died in September 2001 at the age of 91. Bunny Bread itself was created in 1947, according to the Bunny Bread website.

<text>Cobden is a village in Union County, Illinois, United States, within the Southern Illinois region informally known as &quot;Little Egypt.” The population estimate as of 2023 is 1,023, a decline of over 10% since the 2010 census. Cobden is regionally known for the mascot of its public school district, Cobden Unit School District #17, called the &quot;Appleknockers,” which has been voted as one of the most unique high school mascots in the country by numerous publications.
The area around Cobden is widely known for its many wineries and orchards, most notably Flamm Orchards, which is just north of town, and Rendleman Orchard in nearby Alto Pass, Illinois.
==History==
The village is named after British politician Richard Cobden, who visited the town in 1859. An early variant name was &quot;South Pass&quot;.
Cobden began as an agricultural town and developed around the tracks of a route owned by the Illinois Central Railroad (now owned by Canadian National Railway), as well as being along a main highway, U.S. Highway 51, running through the region.

==Geography==
Cobden is located at (37.533949, -89.255409).
Cobden lies 13.7 miles south of Carbondale, Illinois and just north of the towns of Anna, Illinois and Jonesboro, Illinois, along Old U.S Highway 51, which runs straight through town. Nearby Alto Pass, Illinois lies 5.1 miles to the northwest.

According to the 2010 census, Cobden has a total area of , of which (or 99.27%) is land and (or 0.73%) is water.

Cobden is located near the crest of the Shawnee Hills. It is in &quot;Cobden Col&quot;, a valley cut into rock by water near the summit of this ancient mountain range. Approximately 100,000 years ago, the Illinoian ice sheet covered almost all of Illinois. As it pushed south, the ice sheet climbed the Shawnee Mountains. The height of the ice sheet was much greater than that of the mountains. It stopped before it reached their summits. As it melted, a lake formed between the mountains and the glacier. Cobden Col was the outlet of this lake.

==Mascot==
Cobden&#x27;s mascot is the &quot;Appleknocker,&quot; a man with freckles wearing a straw hat and chewing on a piece of straw. This nickname originated when the high school first began to compete in athletics. It did not yet have a mascot, so other schools made up this derogatory term to insult the new school because of their large industry in peach and apple orchards. However, when Cobden High School played for the Illinois High School Boys Basketball Championshipin 1964, this name was cemented in the town&#x27;s history and became part of its cultural identity, even though it lost to Pekin High School 50-45.

<text>Alvin is a village in South Ross Township, Vermilion County, Illinois, United States. It is part of the Danville, Illinois Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 316 at the 2000 census. The U.S. Post Office uses the name Alvin, however the village is also known by the alternate spelling Alvan (for example, by the U.S. Census Bureau).

==History==
A settlement was founded in 1872 about a mile south of present-day Alvan, along the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad, and was called Gilbert in honor of the founder, Alvan Gilbert. In 1875, the new Havana, Rantoul and Eastern Railroad (which became the Illinois Central Railroad) crossed the C&amp;EI north of Gilbert, and the town of Alvan was founded at the intersection. Tradition says that the town&#x27;s name became Alvin (with an &quot;i&quot; instead of an &quot;a&quot;) because the post office misspelled it and refused to correct the error.

On March 16, 1942, a tornado struck Alvan and caused much destruction, killing six people. A marker in the town commemorates the tragic event and reads as follows:

Alvin Tornado

Billy Smith - Henry O&#x27;Farrell
Ruth Viles - George Johnson

==History==
The original settlement in this immediate area was to the west of Bismarck&#x27;s location, where the Hubbard Trail and the North Fork of the Vermilion River crossed.

Later, in 1843, Brothers John and Samuel Myers built a mill near the site of Franklin, and a town called Myersville later grew up there.

In 1872, the C&amp;EI Railroad went through the area; the tracks did not go through Myersville, but passed one and a half miles to the east. Gradually, the town moved toward the railroad on land donated by Charles S. Young and Dr. John B. Holloway. Young named the town Bismarck after the German statesman and chancellor Otto von Bismarck, whom he admired.

On September 13, 1997, the community celebrated its 125th birthday. Festivities, which were attended by about 2,000 people, included a parade, contests, historical exhibits at the local grade school, and multiple performances.

<text>Fairmount is a village in Vance Township, Vermilion County, Illinois, United States. It is part of the Danville, Illinois Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 642 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Josiah Hunt, a railroad engineer, reportedly used inside information about the coming of the Great Western Railroad to purchase of land along the new route to found a town. He originally named the town Salina, but this was changed because of an existing Illinois town named Saline; Francis Dougherty, an early settler, is said to have selected the name Fairmount. The town was incorporated in 1863.

Coal mining was attempted east of Fairmount, but this proved to be impractical because of water. Later, Jacob C. Sandusky discovered an outcropping of limestone in his farm, and quarries were established which at one time employed about 400 people. The quarries are now flooded and make a popular fishing location.

<text>Hoopeston () is a city in Grant Township, Vermilion County, Illinois, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 4,915.

==History==

Hoopeston was laid out in 1871. It was named for Thomas Hoopes, one of the men who offered land for the crossing of two railroads: the Lafayette, Bloomington and Western Railroad and the Chicago, Danville and Vincennes Railroad. The two railroads separated the town into four sections. The latter railroad still exists and is now operated jointly by CSX Transportation and Union Pacific Railroad.

In 1890, Greer College was established in Hoopeston, funded by a gift of $40,000 and of land from John Greer.

Business and manufacturing in Hoopeston have historically been related to agriculture. In 1875, S. S. McCall established the Illinois Canning Company to can locally grown vegetables, and this was so successful that in 1878 the Hoopeston Canning Company was established, which later became part of Stokely-Van Camp, Inc. In addition, Silgan Can (formerly American Can) had a factory which manufactured the tin cans themselves, and an FMC plant manufactured agricultural machinery. There was also an engine company there until at least 1915, the Hoopeston Gas Engine Company, which catered to agriculture and home use. Hoopeston was also the location of one of several prisoner of war camps housing German soldiers during World War II (see German Prisoner of War Camp, Hoopeston, Illinois); many POWs picked crops for the canneries.

In honor of its agricultural roots, including the growing of sweet corn, Hoopeston holds a Sweet Corn Festival each September, starting the Thursday before Labor Day and ending on Labor Day. In association with the festival, the Miss National Sweetheart is held during the same week. Runners-up from the Miss America state pageants are eligible to compete for the title of Miss National Sweetheart.

Hoopeston is now surrounded by many wind turbines that have been organized into computerized wind farms.

==Miss National Sweetheart pageant==
The Miss National Sweetheart beauty pageant was created in 1941. Its contestants are runners-up from the Miss America state pageants who have been invited to Hoopeston for the competition. The event, which has no official ties to the Miss America Organization, is sponsored by the Hoopeston Jaycees and is held on Labor Day weekend in conjunction with the town&#x27;s annual Sweetcorn Festival. Most contestants were the first runners-up in their state pageants, but second and other runners-up are invited if the first runner-up chooses not to attend. The winner of the title receives a $1,200 scholarship and a pendant shaped like an ear of corn.

Winning this title does not guarantee that a contestant will win a Miss America state title, but since 1980, five Miss National Sweetheart winners have gone on to win both their state and the Miss America title. Since 1970 there have been nine Miss America titleholders who have competed in the National Sweetheart pageant.

In 2016, the Miss America organization officially disassociated itself with the Miss National Sweetheart Organization. Pursuant to their decision, Miss America state pageant contestants are prohibited from competing for Miss National Sweetheart.

<text>Oakwood is a village in Oakwood Township, Vermilion County, Illinois, United States. It is part of the Danville, Illinois Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,595 at the 2010 census, and 1,507 in 2018.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Oakwood has a total area of , all land.

==History==
The area where Oakwood currently is built was historically inhabited by the Kickapoo, Potawatomi, Pienkeshaw, all tribes of indigenous peoples; the indigenous peoples discovered the salts mines which would later become the start of the town’s economy. 

The first white presence in the area was that of the French, who documented the salty water near the Vermilion River in 1706. In the early 1800s, fur trappers employed by John Jacob Astor&#x27;s American Fur Company arrived in the area. The indigenous peoples were driven westward into reservations as a result of several treaties over the course of the early 1800s.

In October 1819 an army surveyor team of white settlers and Shawnee hired guides arrived in the region, searching for salt mines. They established wells and salt mining in the area. In 1824, Major John W. Vance came from Urbana, Ohio and gained control of the mine, increasing production by bringing in more iron kettles to boil the saltwater down. Due to competition from other mines the mine eventually shut down in the late 1830s/early 1840s. 

The village of Oakwood is named after Henry Oakwood, an early settler in the area who arrived in 1833. The township of Oakwood was created in 1868 and Oakwood station (which would become the village) was created in 1870.

From the 1860s onward coal mining became a major source of jobs and industry in Vermilion County.

<text>Potomac () is a village in Vermilion County, Illinois, United States. It is part of the Danville, Illinois Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 750 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The town was originally named Marysville after the wives of the two founders, John Smith and Isaac Meneley, who started businesses here &quot;circa&quot; 1840. On May 13, 1871, a post office was established at the town and was named Potomac, most likely after the Potomac River. The town&#x27;s name was later changed to conform to this.

The town was hit by a tornado in April 1953, injuring a dozen people.

Potomac prospered into the late 20th century, with a population peaking at 900 during the 1970 census, due in part to its location along US Route 136, one of the primary East-West highways crossing the state of Illinois. The opening of Interstate 74 reduced the amount of travel through Potomac, leading to a rapid decline in the number of service stations, restaurants and small businesses in the downtown area in the early 1970s. In the early 1990s a fire destroyed several downtown buildings on the north side of Route 136, dramatically altering the appearance of the community.

Potomac is known for its Artesian wells, and its local High School teams were known as the &quot;Potomac Artesians&quot; until area secondary school consolidation in the mid 90&#x27;s. One of these wells spouted an eight-inch stream of water 32 feet into the air until the 1930s. Three wells presently operate in open areas, one located in the downtown area, another on the southeast edge of the community, and another in West Side Park, on the west edge of town area where Fourth of July celebrations were once held, locally referred to as &quot;The Jubilee&quot;, in conjunction with an annual Horse Show.

Hugh M. Luckey (1873–1946), farmer and Illinois state legislator, was born near Potomac, on a farm.

==Geography==
Potomac is located approximately 18 miles northwest of the county seat of Danville. U.S. Route 136 passes east–west through town. The Middle Fork of the Vermilion River passes just south of the town.

<text>Rankin is a village in Butler Township, Vermilion County, Illinois, United States. It is part of the Danville, Illinois Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 561 at the 2010 census.

==History==
This town was named after W. A. Rankin, a wealthy landowner in the area. In 1872, there was a dispute between him and W. H. Pells (who was on the board of directors of the Lake Erie and Western Railroad) over the location of a railroad station. Ultimately, over the course of several years, Rankin won out over Pellsville, which was located a mile and a half to the west. There were railroad maintenance shops in Rankin until 1932 when they were moved to Frankfort, Indiana, and some of the residents of Rankin followed.

In 1972 the town celebrated its centennial, and a small commemorative volume was issued with brief articles on many of the town&#x27;s families.

==The Veterans Memorial==
Located on the Main street in Rankin, it was built in 1996.
Local people joined together and put in motion to build this memorial.
Due credit goes to RTHS graduate Margaret &quot;Maggie&quot; Olson Diskin, who spearheaded this project.

Names of more than 700 men and women from the Rankin area who served the United States of America in war and peace are embedded on this monument, including the Civil War, Spanish–American War, WW I, WW II, Korean War, Lebanon Conflict, Vietnam War, Korean War, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom.

<text>Westville is a village in Georgetown Township, Vermilion County, Illinois, United States. It is part of the Danville, Illinois Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 3,202 at the 2010 census, and 2,990 in 2018.

== History ==
The town was laid out in May 1873 by William P. and Elizabeth A. West, although it started out as a station on the Danville and Southwestern Railroad, and there had been settlements in this area prior to the platting. The first known settler was Moses Scott, who purchased land and built a structure in 1827. The post office was established on January 12, 1874. Telephone lines were first installed in 1900, and electricity arrived in 1901.

During its early days, Westville had many immigrants who lived separately in their own neighborhoods that evoked the tastes, smells, and sounds of different cultures in each neighborhood; the town was known as a &quot;Little Chicago&quot; as it mirrored the different cultures there. Today, many people still carry on the Eastern European names of their ancestors, though it has become more integrated.

Westville played the first regular season night high school football game, that counted towards the season record, under permanent lights, in the United States in 1928. It has been much debated that it was in 1892 in Mansfield, Ohio, but that was not two high schools playing each other and the lights were not permanent. The first night game in Illinois was played in Elgin on October 28, 1898, but again, it was under temporary lighting. Friday Night High School Football, as we know it today, started in Westville, Illinois in 1928.

In 2007, &quot;Remember Westville&quot; was published by author James E. Bryant. The critically acclaimed book chronicled in detail the 1976 Westville Tigers basketball team and their season, as well as a brief history of the village of Westville. Westville finished the season 27-3, garnering a spot in the Illinois High School Association&#x27;s Sweet Sixteen state tournament. The Tigers lost 67-65 in the final seconds to the eventual state champion, Mt. Pulaski in the Decatur Super Sectional at Milliken University.

Westville is known for its Labor Day celebration. The village celebrates with an annual parade showcasing local businesses, schools, and officials. St. Mary&#x27;s church also partakes in Labor Day with an International Food Festival and a raffle drawing.

<text>Mount Carmel is a city in and the county seat of Wabash County, Illinois, United States. At the time of the 2010 census, the population was 7,284, and it is the largest city in the county. The next largest town in Wabash County is Allendale, population 458.

Located at the confluence of the Wabash, Patoka, and White rivers, Mount Carmel borders both Gibson and Knox counties of Indiana. A small community known informally as East Mount Carmel sits near the mouth of the Patoka River on the opposite (Gibson County) side of the Wabash River from Mount Carmel. Mount Carmel is northeast of the Forest of the Wabash, a National Natural Landmark within Beall Woods State Park and about a mile north-northeast of one of its main employers, the Gibson Generating Station. Mount Carmel is also the home of Wabash Valley College, part of the Community College System of Eastern Illinois. Some know Mt. Carmel as Mountain Carmel.

==History==

===Tornado===
On June 4, 1877, a tornado of F4 intensity touched down just west of Mount Carmel and moved east-northeast, devastating the town. The storm&#x27;s line of destruction wreaked havoc on a large part of the territory between Third and Fifth streets. The velocity of the wind was estimated at 150 miles per hour for a duration of almost two minutes.

As described in a local newspaper at the time: &quot;During its prevalence the air was filled with flying roofs, windows, doors, lumber, rails, clothing, etc. Much of the debris was carried more than a mile away. Thirteen persons were killed outright, and many others will undoubtedly die of their injuries. There are also several others reported missing who are probably buried in the ruins. It being a rainy day, many farmers who could not work at home were in town. The county court was also in session, which caused many people to be in the city.

Men, women and children were blown a distance of 400 feet, as if they were feathers. The better part of the town Is destroyed. Some seventy families were rendered houseless and much distress is anticipated.&quot;

Final estimates of the damage indicate that 20 businesses and 100 homes were damaged or destroyed. At least 16 people, and as many as 30, were killed, with 100 injured.

===Grand Rapids Hotel and Resort===
In the 1920s, there was a hotel in Wabash County near the Grand Rapids Dam and Hanging Rock on the Wabash River. The hotel was called the Grand Rapids Hotel and was owned by Frederick Hinde Zimmerman. During the hotel&#x27;s nine-year existence, it catered to individuals from all over the United States. 

==Geography==

Mount Carmel is located on the Wabash River, which demarcates the Indiana border. According to the 2010 census, the city has a total area of , of which (or 97.20%) is land and (or 2.80%) is water.

The city was featured in Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not! for its once multicolored bridge over the Wabash River, painted white and black on the Illinois and Indiana sides of the state line, respectively. The old twelve span Parker truss bridge, later repainted entirely green, formerly connected Princeton, Indiana to Mount Carmel via Indiana State Road 64 and Illinois Route 15. Illinois Route 1 and Illinois Route 15 meet just a few blocks from the bridge. One rail bridge runs parallel to the IN-64/IL-15 bridge, and another sits just a few miles south, near the southernmost edge of the city. The plans to build a new bridge become reality in 2008. After three years of construction the new much wider span opens in January 2011. The new bridge is a milestone as Indiana continues its quest to expand Indiana 64 to a four-lane highway as part of the Major Moves Project.
As of February 20, 2011 the new concrete and steel beam bridge is fully carrying traffic. The old bridge has been removed, with the river spans being imploded.

== Education ==

Mount Carmel is home to Wabash Valley College, part of the Illinois Eastern Community Colleges (IECC). The college has 1375 students, and has an active international student program. The small town atmosphere provides a laid back, comfortable setting in which international students may study English as a second language (ESL). As part of the IECC, residents benefit from a reciprocal agreement where some of the out-of-state fees to attend the University of Southern Indiana are waived, in exchange for similar tuition discounts for Indiana students in IECC schools. Their men&#x27;s basketball team, the Warriors, won the NJCAA Division I championships in 2001.

Mount Carmel&#x27;s K-12 school district is Wabash Community Unit School District 348. It has two elementary schools, divided by grade (Mount Carmel Elementary School and Mount Carmel Grade School), Mount Carmel Junior High School, and Mount Carmel High School, the only high school in the county. The high school&#x27;s football team, The Golden Aces, won the class 3A state championships in 1981, and the team made it to the playoffs 21 years in a row. They play at home in Riverview Stadium, commonly known as &quot;The Snake Pit&quot;. The stadium is notable for having been built into the side of a large hill.

==Employment and environment==

The town had an unemployment rate of 5.4%, as of Dec 2014. The situation has substantially improved since 1992, when the unemployment rate peaked as high as 15.1% with the loss of industrial jobs.

Duke Energy&#x27;s Gibson Generating Station is the nearest employer of substantial size. The Gibson County, Indiana power plant is located less than a mile away from Mount Carmel, directly across the river. It is the third-largest coal power plant in the world, and the ninth largest power plant in the United States.

Additional nearby employers include Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indiana, which produces the Sequoia, Sienna, Highlander, and Highlander Hybrid lines. Many of TMMI&#x27;s Suppliers and subsidiaries are also located in and around Princeton, Indiana, 12 miles away. Other employers include Champion Laboratories plant in Albion, Illinois that produces air and fuel filters and an ATS (now TBIL) plant in Lawrenceville, which also supplies TMMI. Local employers include several oil and gas firms, exploiting the Southern Indiana Oil Basin, which extends into Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky. It once had reserves of more than of crude oil.

On April 5, 2007, Foundation Coal Holdings, Inc., of Linthicum Heights, Maryland, announced plans to close the Wabash Mine in nearby Keensburg, Illinois, meaning a loss of nearly 230 jobs in Wabash County. Mount Carmel lost 270 jobs in 2003 due to the closing of a Snap-on Tools factory, which had operated since 1937.

<text>Monmouth is a city in and the county seat of Warren County, Illinois, United States. The population was 8,902 at the 2020 census, down from 9,444 in 2010. It is the home of Monmouth College and contains Monmouth Park, Harmon Park, North Park, Warfield Park, West Park, South Park, Garwood Park, Buster White Park and the Citizens Lake &amp; Campground. It is the host of the Prime Beef festival, held annually the week after Labor Day. The festival is kicked off with one of the largest parades in Western Illinois. Monmouth is also known regionally as the &quot;Maple City&quot;. It is part of the Galesburg Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Monmouth was settled in about 1824. The town established in 1831 was originally going to be called Kosciusko (the name was drawn out of a hat), but the founders of the town feared that it would be difficult to spell and pronounce. The name &#x27;Monmouth&#x27; was put forward by a resident who had lived in Monmouth County, New Jersey.

In 1841, Latter Day Saint movement founder Joseph Smith appeared before Judge Stephen A. Douglas in an extradition hearing held at Monmouth&#x27;s Warren County courthouse. The hearing, which was to determine whether Smith should be returned to Missouri to face murder charges, resulted in freedom for the defendant, as it was determined that his arrest had been invalid. Attorney Orville Browning, who would assume Douglas&#x27;s Senate seat following his death, represented Smith.

Gunfighter and law man Wyatt Earp was born in Monmouth. Controversial Civil War general Eleazer A. Paine practiced law there for many years. Abner C. Harding, Civil War General and Republican Congressman, lived in Monmouth and is buried in Monmouth Cemetery. Ronald Reagan lived in Monmouth for a while as a child when his father worked as a shoe salesman at the Colwell Department Store. Mass murderer Richard Speck lived in Monmouth briefly as a child, and again in the spring of 1966.

Monmouth College, a private liberal arts college affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), was founded in Monmouth in 1853 by Cedar Creek &amp; South Henderson Presbyterian Churches. With James Cochran Porter &amp; Robert Ross founding in 1852 Monmouth Academy, The Rev. David Alexander Wallace served as the first President 1856–1878. It is the second-largest employer in the city. Pi Beta Phi, the first national secret college society of women to be modeled after the Greek-letter fraternities of men, was founded on its campus in 1867. Just three years later in 1870, Kappa Kappa Gamma, international fraternity for women, was founded on its campus.

Monmouth was home to minor league baseball from 1890 to 1913. The Monmouth Browns and Monmouth Maple Cities (1890) played as members of the Central Association (1910–1913), Illinois-Missouri League (1908–1909), Central Interstate League (1889) and Illinois-Iowa League (1890). Monmouth teams played at 11th Street Park.

A hospital is located in Monmouth.

Monmouth was once home to one of the most unusually named high school sports organizations, the Zippers. Originally known as The Maroons, the Zipper nickname came about in the late 1930s when the school had a fast basketball team that would &quot;Zip&quot; up and down the court. Earl Bennett, a sportswriter nicknamed them &quot;The Zippers&quot; and the name stuck. The school went with the &quot;Zipper&quot; nickname until the 2004–2005 school year when Monmouth consolidated with Roseville and the new Monmouth–Roseville High School adopted the nickname &quot;The Titans&quot;. The class of 2005 was the last class named the Zippers. The Class of 2006 was the first class named the Titans.

Monmouth was the home of Western Stoneware, known for its &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; imprint and for producing &quot;Sleepy Eye&quot; collectible ceramics, which are recognizable by the blue-on-white bas-relief Indian profile. Western Stoneware closed in June 2006. Three former employees of Western Stoneware now operate the facility under the name &quot;WS&quot;, Incorporated and have leased the building and logo from the city of Monmouth.

<text>Fairfield is a city in and the county seat of Wayne County, Illinois, United States, and the location of Frontier Community College. The population was 4,883 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Fairfield is most famous for being the hometown of the &quot;friendly&quot; people, and for the Shelton Brothers Gang, notorious bootleggers who fought it out with the Harrisburg, Illinois-based Birger Gang to control criminal activities in Southern Illinois. During the first half of the 20th century, gang leaders Carl, Earl and Bernie Shelton made Fairfield a household name. Based on testimony of Charlie Birger himself, the Shelton Brothers were convicted for a 1925 unsolved mail carrier robbery of $15,000 and were sentenced to 25 years. They were released a few years later. Birger dominated bootlegging in Southern Illinois until he himself was hanged in Benton for the murder of West City Mayor Joe Adams in 1928. After serving their time, the Shelton brothers built a new criminal empire. Based in East St Louis, one of the most prosperous cities of its day, they controlled all vice from Peoria and southward.

They met their demise at the hands of the Chicago mob and an insider Charles &quot;Blackie&quot; Harris. A land dispute led to Blackie joining forces with the Mob to kill off members of the Shelton gang. His most notable victim was Carl Shelton, the leader. He was ambushed several miles southeast of Fairfield, shot from his Jeep. Bernie was killed at his Peoria roadhouse. Earl moved to Jacksonville, Florida and became a successful land speculator.

=== Local Geography ===
Source:

&quot;Inside a 200 mile radius of Mill Shoals is a unique geographical and historical area described as the Mid-America Basin. It was here, 175,000 years ago, that the Illinoian Glacier withdrew, leaving two great drainage systems in its wake. On the west side of the Basin the Illinois and Missouri Rivers join the Mississippi River; on the east side the Wabash and Tennessee Rivers join the Ohio River. The systems meet at Cairo, Illinois to begin a long journey through the Gulf Coastal Plain. The retreating glacier left rich mineral deposits of oil, coal, and fluorite to await 20th Century exploitation, and ground out a fine top-soil that was to yield vast timber areas of maple, ash, and oak, as well as fertile fields of wheat, corn, barley, and soybeans, As early as 15,000 B. C., pre-historic Indian peoples hunted the mammoths that roamed the area and eventually developed a series of substantial civilizations of the mounds and of the woodlands, climaxing in the Illini Confederation of the 17th and 18th Centuries. In the 18th Century, French and English explorers competed for these lands beginning with Marquette and Joliet in 1673 and ending with the American conquest under George Rogers Clark in 1778, when the Province of Virginia claimed the territory west to the Mississippi River. The next quarter century saw the advent of frontiersmen such as Daniel Boone paving the way for the great western migration. After the War of 1812, the pioneers poured into the Basin along the Cumberland Highway (now U. S. 40) through Terre Haute, Indiana, on the north side of the Basin. They came down the Ohio River from Cincinnati and Louisville, and from Tennessee and Kentucky across the Ohio at Shawneetown, just below the Wabash junction. Thus the Basin became the great staging area that was to funnel settlers through the gate of St. Louis into the far West. Subsequently, the area became the commercial, cultural, and political center for the new frontier--until the construction of the Illinois-Michigan Canal in 1848 shifted the focus northward to Chicago. It was during this time that another famous trail-blazer made his way through the area, giving his name to the nearby Lincoln Heritage Trail. Significant among early 19th Century settlements were experiments in comprehensive self-sufficient communities such as Albion, Illinois, and New Harmony, Indiana, both in the Mill Shoals vicinity. With the advent of the Mill Shoals Human Development Project the Mid-American Basin once again becomes a staging area for the nation&#x27;s effort to pioneer authentic local community.&quot;

&quot;From the 1978 Village Report by the Institute of Cultural Affairs&quot;&quot;:&quot;

&quot;The area is in the northwest corner of White County, Illinois, thirty miles north of Carmi; the county seat, and 160 miles southeast of the state capital, Springfield, Illinois. Evansville, Indiana, is the nearest large city, sixty miles east. The project area is bounded on the north by the county line and on the west by the Skillet Fork River; it extends approximately one mile south and one and one-half miles east from these boundaries. U. S. Highway 45 runs north and south through the town, and Interstate 64, a major east-west route, is two miles north of town. Approximately twenty per cent of the land is farmed (soy-bean and corn), thirty per cent is developed, and fifty per cent is unused. Thirty acres on the southeast edge of town is municipally owned. Annual flooding occurs over the western third of the project area in the flood plain. Of the 314 persons residing in the town of Mill Shoals, seventy-five are retired persons and 107 are dependent children. Educational facilities for the community are the elementary school in Mill Shoals and the high school in Fairfield. nine miles north on Highway 45. Fairfield also serves as the major commercial center used by Mill Shoals residents.&quot;

==History==

The first Euro-American settlers, primarily of Scotch-Irish descent, came to White County, Illinois between 1807 and 1809. The first settlements were near the Little Wabash River and Big Prairie, one of the numerous prairies in the county. Many came through the land office at Shawneetown, which was a port for flatboats which traveled the Ohio River. The second half of the 19th century saw the establishment of the towns of Norris City, Springerton including Mill Shoals. Once the home of a thriving barrel-making industry which depleted the nearby virgin forests Mill Shoals had primarily been an agriculture village until 1939 when oil was discovered in the area. In the early 1970s the oil industry declined steeply and thus returned Mill Shoals to its agricultural roots.
However, the town was greatly devastated by a large fire in the early forties and seventies and retains the authentic WPA Post office mural.

Many residents commute to nearby towns for employment including education, service, factories, and farms.

=== A Portrait of the Village of Mill Shoals in 1978 ===
&quot;From the Institute of Cultural Affairs 1978 Human Development Project Report&quot;&quot;:&quot;&quot;Mill Shoals is a representative mid-American small town with a population of 314 people situated in White County in southern Illinois. It is one of many secluded villages in the hills surrounded by fertile river bottomlands that make up the Wabash Meadows. U. S. Highway 45 passes north-south through the center of town, and a spur of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, built in 1870, brings two freight trains weekly. A county road connects Mill Shoals with Burnt Prairie five miles east along the old stagecoach trail that once connected Ohio River traffic from Shawneetown to central Illinois.&quot;

Incorporated in 1872, Mill Shoals takes its name from the water mill built by William Weed in 1835 on the shoals of the Skillet Fork River at the western boundary of the community. The town is governed by an elected mayor and council, who were responsible for a water supply system and a new grade school in 1965.

Mill Shoals sometimes refers to itself as the key ring capital of the world, an outgrowth of the ring binder, invented by Henry T. Adams of Mill Shoals in 1902, Besides the Adams Manufacturing Company is the Behimer and Kissner Grain Elevator and the more recent Grace Agricultural Products (chemical fertilizers). In addition there is a post office, a hardware store that doubles as an ice manufacturing source for the area, a grocery store, cafe, two service stations, two beauty shops, several private contractors, a funeral parlor, and five churches.

Mill Shoals has a high percentage of retired senior citizens. Most of the citizens who are employed work in nearby Fairfield. The town began informally between 1808 and 1835 as various groups of settlers camped on the high ground in the &quot;drowned lands&quot;. Unremitting floods, plus major fires in 1900 and 1924 devastated the river settlement. 

==== Railroad ====
During the first quarter of the 20th Century Mill Shoals. gradually moved east of the railroad tracks, away from the river. Thus Mill Shoals shifted from a 19th Century milling settlement on the shoals to a 20th Century way-station along the highway. Powerful but transitory economic resources have involved Mill Shoals in booms of productivity followed by periods of depression, depletion of strength and dispersion of employment.

==== Mill and Village Expansion ====
The first boom occurred with the arrival of the Hawkins and Smith Stave Mill in 1892. By the turn of the century the population had mushroomed to 1,500, and the town included a flour mill, saw mill, lumber factory, tile factory, canning factory, grain elevator, two hotels, opera house, saloon, pool room, drug store, hardware store, restaurant, two groceries, barber shop, two general stores, two doctors and a livery stable. A bank was first established in 1903, and in 1906 a Farmers&#x27; Mutual Benefit Association was formed to raise and market livestock. Besides this, Mill Shoals had a weekly newspaper, sidewalks, and obtained electric lighting before Fairfield, with the departure of the stave mill in 1909 a ten-year lull followed which is remembered by old-timers primarily for its great reunions and travelling circus.

The Egyptian Tie and Timber Company sustained the economy for the decade of the 20&#x27;s as the lumbering business boomed. 

==== 1930s-1940s Oil Boom ====
The devastation of the depression was softened only by the oil boom from 1938 to the end of World War II. A long period of economic neglect has seen the growth of welfare dependency and the recent loss of the high school [Mills Prairie, on the Eastern outskirts of Mill Shoals] which had sustained the social life of Mill Shoals since it became a four-year school in 1945. As the nation becomes more dependent on local energy sources, Mill Shoals could well be near the center of a potential coal boom. The question for this community that has held on so tenaciously through boom times and hard times is how it can tie in to another boom and at the same time build a lasting foundation for continuous economic self-sufficiency in the future.

== 1978 Housing and Public Infrastructure ==
&quot;Public facilities include a post office, the elementary school, a combination town hall and fire station. and a new town recreation park under construction. The 176 housing units in Mill Shoals are mainly small, single family dwellings, nearly one fourth of which are mobile homes. Fifty-five per cent of the housing was judged sound in a 1976 survey. At that time, about five per cent of the units were vacant, several of which could be restored for community projects.

The city water is piped into a majority of the homes, while others have pressurized cisterns.

Sewage is processed in septic tanks, many of which are sub-standard. Drainage for the considerable overflow is through open ditches, prohibiting normal laundry activity within the community and occasioning a serious health hazard.

Gas heating and electricity are found in most homes, but telephones are more scarce.

Four of the five churches serving the area are located in Mill Shoals.&quot;

<text>Crossville is a village in White County, Illinois, United States. The population was 745 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Crossville was laid out by surveyor John Mills in 1872 for Thomas Cross and Silas Elliott, and named for Thomas Cross. The original plat was one half mile square (160 acres or a quarter section), located in Section 23, Township 4 South, Range 10 East of the 3rd Principal Meridian.

The town&#x27;s existence is closely tied to the opening of the Cairo and Vincennes Railroad on December 9, 1872. In 1853 the Vincennes and Paducah Railway Company was formed for the purpose of creating a railroad through the area, but that venture was unsuccessful. In 1857 the Illinois Southern Railway Company took up the idea, with a plan that originally contemplated routing the railroad through Phillipstown, but local land owners Stephen Fitzgerald and Solomon Charles refused to donate land to the Railway. Instead, in 1857 Thomas Cross donated right-of-way through the center of what would later become Crossville. The railroad project was stalled during the Civil War, but in 1867 the Cairo and Vincennes Railway Company was formed and work on the railroad proceeded in earnest.

The town was incorporated on September 30, 1895, and the town charter was filed on October 12, 1895, at 11:05 am.

<text>Norris City is a village in White County, Illinois. The population was 1,275 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Norris City was incorporated in 1901.

The original plat of Norris City was filed for record in the White County Courthouse in Carmi, Illinois on August 17, 1871, at 8 a.m.The post office at Norris City was established May 15, 1871, with William A. Johnson appointed as the first Postmaster.
The name for Norris City had to have been decided prior to the time it was platted and prior to the opening of the post office. The question of how Norris City got its name has caused many debates throughout the years.
The new community, for a short time in early 1871, was called “Popeye” or “Popeye’s Station, after William A. Johnson, the first depot agent at the site who had the nickname of Popeye. The trainmen said they were stopping at “Popeye” or “Popeye’s Station.”
The story is that Mr. Johnson&#x27;s eyes protruded, so he was given the nickname of Popeye. This was before the days of the Popeye cartoon character, which was created by a native of Chester, Ill.. The story is, that children going to Gum Prairie Grade School near Mr. Johnson&#x27;s house gave him the nickname. The other story is that he was given the nickname by the trainmen.
Stories about how Norris City got its name are varied, but the following is a result of my research:
First off, it was not named after any of the aforementioned people involved in getting Norris City started and platted. This deepens the mystery.
According to one story, the people of the new village got together to try to agree upon a name for it. It was decided that the name would come from the person or family having the most land in the area. After the acreages were added up, the Norris family beat out the Johnson family by just a few acres. Thus, as the story goes, it was named Norris City. William Norris was the head of the Norris family at that time so it was said to have been named after him.
Another version is that a meeting was held and the railroad had been doing some business with William Norris so they decided to name the town Norris City after him. So the story goes that he went home from the meeting and told his wife, Emaline (White) Norris, and she replied she didn&#x27;t think it was such a big deal to have such a small place named after you.
Another story is that Thomas Ridgway, for whom Ridgway was named, was on a train going through here. Mr. Ridgway was  the President of the Springfield and Illinois Southeastern Railroad, and he asked what the town had been named. It is said that the foreman of the construction crew, or one version says he was conductor or engineer of the train, spoke up and said the trainmen call it Popeye or Popeye&#x27;s Station. Mr. Ridgway, so the story goes, said that was no name for a town. This trainman is then supposed to have said, “Why don’t you name it after me?” So they did. His name was supposed to have been John William Norris of Fairfield. Nellie Johnson, wife of Mel Johnson, said her father was on the train when this happened. Mel and Nellie Johnson operated Johnson&#x27;s Hardware of the south side of East Main Street in Norris City for years.
Another version of this story is that the engineer of the work train constructing the railroad tracks to the site of Norris City boarded at the home of William Norris, and his wife Emaline (White) Norris at the west edge of the site of the new village. It is said that he was the one who spoke up and suggested the name for the town. He was fond of the cooking of Mrs. Emaline Norris, who was noted as a good cook. For this reason, it is said that he suggested the name Norris City, naming the town after her and not her husband, William Norris. Jessie (Robb) Newkirk, wife of Vollie Newkirk (parents of Beth (Newkirk) Rister) and a granddaughter of William and Emaline Norris said that her grandmother always said that the town was named after her and not after her husband. A brother and a sister of Jessie Newkirk also told the same story that had been told to them by their grandmother Norris.

The book, “Illinois, a Descriptive and Historical Guide,” compiled in 1939 by Federal Works Agency, Works Project Administration, states that Norris City, altitude 444, population 1109, a trading center for an agricultural and coal mining district was named in honor of a pioneer settler, William Norris.
A reference report of the Illinois State Historical Library states, “No information is available in our records as to the origins of the name, Norris City.”

<text>Phillipstown is a village in White County, Illinois, United States. The population was 28 at the 2000 census.
==History==
Phillipstown was surveyed for Caleb Clifford on February 19, 1839, and the plat was recorded on January 2, 1843. It was originally named Victoria, but at that time the name was already in use by another post office in Illinois, so a new name had to be chosen. By order of the State Legislature, on January 29, 1840, it was renamed in honor of Major Alexander Phillips, an early settler of the area who had made a land entry for an adjoining property in 1817 while the area was still part of Illinois Territory.

The land upon which Phillipstown was platted had originally been entered by James Phillips, who quite likely was Alexander Phillips&#x27; father. James&#x27; interest in the land was sold to David Phillips and John McClure Graham (husband of Rebecca Phillips), who received a patent to the land on November 15, 1830 (David and Rebecca were likely siblings of Alexander). They sold the property to Major Alexander Phillips on January 6, 1837. On February 17, 1837, he sold the property to Caleb Clifford.

In addition to his service during the War of 1812, Major Alexander Phillips was also elected to serve in the House of Representatives for White County, Illinois in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 11th &amp; 12th Illinois General Assemblies.

<text>Morrison is a city and the county seat of Whiteside County, Illinois, United States. The population was 4,188 at the 2010 census, down from 4,447 in 2000. It is located on the Historic Lincoln Highway, the nation&#x27;s first transcontinental highway and in Morrison was the site of two concrete &quot;seedling miles&quot;, which served as prototypes of what an improved highway could do for the nation.

==History==
In 1854, Lyman Johnson and H. S. Vroom were already in what would become the City of Morrison as contractors and builders for the Air-line railroad, now the Union Pacific Railroad. Johnson and Vroom, along with several other entrepreneurs, acquired the land that would surround the rail station that was planned here. They managed the work of surveyor W.S. Wilkinson in the layout of the future town in 1855. Among these entrepreneurs were W.H. Van Epps. Lyman Johnson decided to call the town Morrison, in honor of Charles Morrison, a friend of Van Epps and a wealthy merchant from New York, who promised financial support in the way of loans for the town&#x27;s development. Shortly thereafter, Morrison suffered severe financial losses and he was unable to participate, yet his name remained.

==Industry==
Refrigerator manufacturer, Illinois Refrigerator Company, was organized in 1892 by Edward A. Smith, J.B. Markey, George Brown, F.L. Sands, and F.R. Beals. Later it added school furniture to its line: Columbia School Equipment Company, which was a subsidiary of the Illinois Refrigerator Company. In 1914, Illinois Refrigerator Company acquired equipment to manufacture stoves, establishing the Summit Stove Company. Two additional school furniture companies formed the Illinois Seating Company and built a new factory in Morrison. The Morris and Rich Toy Factory of Sterling, IL moved to Morrison in 1928, locating in part of the Illinois Refrigerator Company building. In November 1929, a fire damaged two warehouses owned by Illinois Refrigerator Company, Rich Manufacturing Company, and Columbia School Equipment Company. The fire destroyed over 4,000 refrigerators and $35,000 worth of toys, including five or more carloads, which were on the nearby railroad tracks. The total loss was estimated at $500,000. By April 1932, the refrigerator company was bankrupt. Soon after, a new corporation was formed: Rich Illinois Manufacturing Company. The company made wood and metal refrigerators, electric refrigerators, toys, furniture, wood ware, and wood and metal fabricated buildings. In 1934, The City Ice and Fuel Company of Cleveland, OH, which operated under the name Ice Cooling Appliance Corporation (ICA), purchased the plant. The toy factory, Rich Illinois Manufacturing, moved to Clinton, Iowa. In 1954, ICA was sold to American Air Filter Company, Inc. at Louisville, Kentucky, which had consolidated with Herman Nelson Corporation of Moline, Illinois. In 1957, the Herman Nelson division established a factory in Morrison to manufacture air blowers, small portable heaters, and air conditioners, which eventually closed in 1966, moving to Brownsville, Tennessee.

General Electric started its Morrison plant in 1949, as a branch of the Schenectady, New York department. It became the Appliance Control Department in 1952 and was one of the first units to be established in a decentralization program. Early production included relays, switchettes, and sump pump switches, followed by cold and heat controls. In 1952, the manufacture of range timers was transferred to the Morrison factory from Somersworth, New Hampshire. In ensuing year, gas igniters, thermostats, and small d.c. motors were added. In 1965, a branch plant was established at Bridgeport, CT; the department&#x27;s headquarters remained at Morrison. The plant closed in 2010.

Current major employers within the community include Whiteside County government, Morrison Community School District #6, Morrison Community Hospital, Climco Coils, and Resthave Home.

<doc id="112043" wikidata="Q574925" url="?curid=112043" title="Prophetstown, Illinois">
<text>Prophetstown is a city in Whiteside County, Illinois, United States. The population was 2,080 at the 2010 census, up from 2,023 in 2000.

==Geography==
Prophetstown is located at (41.670504, -89.935869).

According to the 2010 census, Prophetstown has a total area of , of which (or 98.28%) is land and (or 1.72%) is water.

==History==
An 1825 treaty established an unnamed &quot;Winnebago village&quot; about 40 miles above the mouth of the Rock River as a boundary point of the Winnebago, corresponding to the location of Prophetstown.

Prophetstown occupies the site of the village of the Winnebago prophet, which the Illinois volunteers destroyed on May 10, 1832, in the first act of hostility in the Black Hawk War. Prophetstown was named for Wabokieshiek (White Cloud), the prophet who lived upon the land. Wabokieshiek served as an advisor to Black Hawk and took part in the Black Hawk War. Wabokieshiek and his followers, the Sauk people, resided where the current Prophetstown State Park (of Illinois) is now located. They left the land in 1832 as the Black Hawk War ended, when Wabokieshiek was taken captive by the United States. This area is now a state park, but at one time it held a community of 14 villages.

It is believed that residents of Prophetstown petitioned to move the U.S. government from Washington D.C. to Prophetstown in the 1800s because of its supposed central location of the lower 48 states.

Prophetstown once held community events such as Cruise Night, an event which showcased many classic cars, held at Eclipse Park in the town center. Eventually the event fell out of favor and a memorial was built in the park to honor those who served in the Armed Forces. 

Prophetstown is still held in high esteem for having one of the largest Fourth of July fireworks shows in the area. Prophetstown also hosts a Lighted Christmas Parade as the highlight of the start of the holiday season the Saturday before Thanksgiving. Prophetstown is an Illinois Main Street Community. The downtown features a series of historical murals and Eclipse Square Park as well as a selection of stores and restaurants.

<doc id="112045" wikidata="Q578314" url="?curid=112045" title="Sterling, Illinois">
<text>Sterling is a city in Whiteside County, Illinois, United States, along the Rock River. The population was 14,782 at the 2020 census, down from 15,370 in 2010. Formerly nicknamed &quot;Hardware Capital of the World&quot;, the city has long been associated with manufacturing and the steel industry.

==History==

In 1834, Hezekiah Brink built the first cabin in what was to become Harrisburg. Two years later, William Kirkpatrick settled downstream in an area that became Chatham.In 1838, Harrisburg and Chatham merged to become the Town of Sterling in an effort to become the county seat. The name &quot;Sterling&quot; was chosen to honor Major James Sterling, who distinguished himself in the area during the Blackhawk War in 1832. On February 16, 1857, Sterling was incorporated as a city by state law.

On July 18, 1856, Abraham Lincoln visited Sterling to speak at a rally for the presidential candidate John C. Fremont. He spent the night at the home of Sheriff William Manahan, which has since been preserved and renovated into the Lincoln-Manahan Home. He gave his speech in Propheter Park, where a statue has been erected in his honor.

The Rock River failed to become a major navigational route as once hoped, but it provided power for the saw and grist mills, and later to a booming industrial base. In 1856, the first rail lines were laid in the area. With the power from the river and the transportation provided by the railroads, Sterling&#x27;s business and industry grew. During the late 19th and early 20th century, the community&#x27;s industrial bedrock was laid with the founding of Northwestern Steel &amp; Wire Co., Lawrence Brothers Inc, National Manufacturing Co., The Frantz Manufacturing Company, and the Wahl Clipper Corporation.

Sterling has diversified and adapted to the 21st century. Its industrial base has expanded; the city has filled two industrial parks and made development for a third and fourth. Retail sales for the region have expanded as Sterling has emerged as a regional retail hub. Outside the city, the landscape is dominated by agricultural fields that typify most of the Midwest.

The cities of Sterling, Nebraska, and Sterling, Colorado, were both founded by former residents of Sterling, Illinois, as they branched out across the West.

<doc id="112047" wikidata="Q2214752" url="?curid=112047" title="Beecher, Illinois">
<text>Beecher is a village in Will County, Illinois, United States. It is located on the old Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad and the Dixie Highway. Situated in the center of Washington Township, it was originally named Washington Center. Named for Henry Ward Beecher, Beecher was founded in 1870 and incorporated as a village in 1884. Originally governed by a village president and board of trustees, a village administrator was hired to handle daily tasks in 1988. The city clerk is an appointed position.

The population was 4,713 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Early Days of Beecher

T.L. Miller arrived in Washington Township in 1862 and began purchasing land. His plan was to begin breeding and raising Hereford cattle. He knew the area offered good grazing lands; and he was convinced that the Hereford breed of beef cattle showed great promise for the future. At the time, T.L. Miller lived in Chicago and was in the fire and insurance business. Mr. Miller was a great admirer of Henry Ward Beecher, the most famous orator of that time, and named the new village after him.

Mr. Miller purchased his first 320 acres of land from the government. Later he added another 400 acres. He began making improvements immediately on his property, which he called Highland Stock Farm. His son. T.E. (Timothy Elliott) Miller recalled: “On his beautiful farm, he established the finest and largest herd of Hereford cattle in America. To him is due the credit of the wide dissemination of this great breed of beef cattle in the United States. A man of great energy, his name was widely known in England and America in connection with the Hereford breed of cattle.”

To further promote Hereford cattle, he established the “Breeder’s Journal” in 1880 and published it for eight years. In addition, he gathered and assembled the pedigree of Hereford cattle in the first two volumes of the “Hereford Herd Book”. Both were published in Beecher.

The Railroad

Sometime after his initial purchase of land, T. L. Miller learned that the Chicago, Danville and Vincennes Railroad was coming through the area. He was able to acquire an additional 340 acres west of his original property and adjoining the proposed railroad on both sides. He secured the promise of a railroad station within his property. Early in 1869, work began on the new railroad. It would run from Chicago, through Danville and eventually cross the Wabash River to Vincennes, crossing through the easternmost tier of Illinois counties. Sometime before October 1869, the track was laid through the future Village of Beecher. By January 1870, there was complete rail service to Chicago.

The railroad assured Beecher&#x27;s future. Chicago was just 37 miles to the north by rail, and from there, connections could be made to any part of the country. Then in 1870, Mr. Miller asked George Dolton to lay out the future village, with a business section on both sides of the railroad, and beyond that, twelve blocks on each side for future development of homes and other businesses.

Beecher Depot

With efficient rail service running through the new village, further development began to build up near the railroad. By the end of the century, there was a thriving business section in the heart of the village. The depot became the center of activity. It was located on Reed Street, between Hodges and Penfield and was built in 1881 by the Chicago, Danville &amp; Vincennes (CD&amp;V) RR. The Chicago &amp; Eastern Illinois (C&amp;EI) RR took it over and operated it until the 1960s when it closed. The depot was sold and moved to Monee, Illinois to Thompson&#x27;s Winery where it was used as a gift shop until the 1980s. It was returned to its original site in Beecher in 2000, and renovated to its present state. It is a standard wooden depot and one of the last of its kind left on the former C&amp;EI route. It is the home of the local historical society and is open on Saturdays from 10 a.m. until noon.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Beecher has a total area of , all land. The majority of the village is in Section 16 of Washington Township.

A branch of Trim Creek flows through Beecher, but this carries very little water most of the year.

Beecher is located in the center of a primarily agricultural township. Beecher Consolidated School District provides educational services for Washington Township and of the neighboring, entirely rural, Will Township.

The nearest towns are Crete, Illinois, north; Grant Park, south; Peotone, west and Cedar Lake, Indiana, east.

Beecher residents have ten parks within the village&#x27;s borders to utilize. Via these parks, Beecher offers its citizens access to jogging paths, soccer fields, picnic areas, playgrounds, and baseball fields. Ten-acre Welton Stedt Park is the largest park in the village. Located adjacent to Beecher Junior High School, Welton Stedt Park boasts four ballfields, a pond, and portable toilets. Firemen&#x27;s Park, situated in the heart of Beecher, has picnic pavilions, a snack shack, a stage, bathroom facilities, ballfields, walking paths, and a seasonal ice rink. Beecher&#x27;s annual Fourth of July Festival has been held in Firemen&#x27;s Park for decades.

&quot;Ribbon of Hope” Cancer Awareness Garden

The Ribbon of Hope Commission was established by the Beecher Village Board in 2013 with the goal of creating a small garden that would promote cancer awareness. A small plot of land in Fireman&#x27;s Park was selected as the site of the garden, and on May 20, 2018, the garden&#x27;s centerpiece, a metallic sculpture in the form of a ribbon, was dedicated.

==Early history==
In 1864, a farmer digging for water at the site of the present city found coal instead. Deposits were substantial and the demand for coal in nearby Chicago was high, so companies rushed to acquire land and set up operations. A mining boomtown sprang up, a post office was established in 1867, and the community was called Keeversville. James Braidwood was an early member of the community, and in 1872 he was hired by one company to superintend the sinking of the first deep mine shaft. The addition of more deep-shaft mines followed, and on March 4, 1873 the city was incorporated
and named in Braidwood&#x27;s honor.

Concerning the city&#x27;s early population, Donna reports, 

Businesses and the lives of residents were centered on the coal mines, with economic prosperity and depression occurring in their turn. Mines cut back operations during summer months, when warm weather reduced the demand for coal, leaving many miners unemployed. The disputes between coal companies and miners over wages and working conditions were always rancorous and often violent, typical for the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

On February 16, 1883, the Diamond Mine in Braidwood was suddenly flooded, resulting in the deaths of 73 miners. See 1883 Diamond Mine Disaster.

There was a combination of ethnicities, providing religious and cultural diversity. At first most miners were Americans or immigrants from northern Europe. African Americans arrived from West Virginia, and many later residents would arrive as immigrants from eastern and southern Europe.

<doc id="112052" wikidata="Q1334394" url="?curid=112052" title="Elwood, Illinois">
<text>Elwood is a village in rural Will County, Illinois, United States, approximately 40 miles southwest of Chicago. The population was 2,229 at the 2020 United States Census, down from 2,279 in 2010.

==History==
Elwood was founded in 1854 and incorporated as a village in 1869. The completion of the Joliet–Bloomington railroad, now part of the Union Pacific system, played a major role in the founding of Elwood. By 1900, Elwood was a small farming community with a population of about 400.

In the late 1930s, the federal government acquired nearby land for military training and weapons production, on which site the Joliet Arsenal was built and commenced operation in 1940. Arsenal construction played an important role in the development of Elwood and brought about 175 people into the area. In 1942, a massive explosion at the arsenal killed 42 workers and caused widespread damage.

In 1954, the village celebrated its centennial, and 20,000 people gathered to watch the parade. By 1970, Elwood had a population of about 750. On May 8, 1988, a tornado touched down about three miles (5 km) north of the village, uprooting large trees and heavily damaging some homes and pole buildings.

In 1990, the village began to experience more rapid growth. By 1996, Elwood’s population rose to nearly 1,423, with development accelerated due to the construction of the CenterPoint Intermodal Center facility. The village’s population peaked at 2,279, according to the 2010 US census, decreasing to 2,229, according to the 2020 US census. The Northern Illinois Planning Commission had projected that Elwood would have a population of nearly 20,000 by 2030, which given the 2.2. percent population contraction noted in the 2020 census, is not likely to be realized.

The Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, a prairie reserve operated by the United States Forest Service is located on the site of the former Joliet Army Ammunition Plant near Elwood, and was established by federal law in 1996. In 1999, the 982 acre (397 ha) Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery was dedicated in Elwood. When fully completed, it will provide 400,000 burial spaces.

===Fires===
Three major fires have taken place in Elwood, the first on August 26, 1995, in which the fire station was destroyed. The second, which occurred on May 5, 2008, completely destroyed Bill’s Inn. A residential fire in the Wyndstone Village subdivision on April 17, 2009, caused extensive damage to two townhomes.

==Geography==
Elwood is located at (41.413615, -88.110438). The nearest major highways are Interstate 80 to the north and Interstate 69 to the west. The former Route 99 highway passes through the village on the east side. According to the 2010 census, Elwood has a total area of , all land.

<text>New Lenox is a village in central Will County, Illinois, United States. It is a Southwest suburb of Chicago. The village population was 27,214 as of the 2020 census. New Lenox has schools like Lincoln-Way West High School, Providence Catholic High School, and Lincoln-Way Central High School.

==History==

What is now the Village of New Lenox was first settled in the late 1820s, in the area of Gougar crossing (Route 30 and Gougar Road) and it was called VanHorne Point. New Lenox Township was established when Will County was created in 1852 with the building of the Rock Island Railroad between Chicago and Rock Island, Illinois. Originally named Tracey in honor of the general superintendent of the Rock Island Railroad. Mr. Tracy later requested that the community be renamed. The first supervisor of the Rock Island Railway for New Lenox Township, John Van Duser, named the Township New Lenox from the town Lenox, New York, which was Van Duser&#x27;s hometown. In 1863, the name for the new settlement officially became New Lenox Township.

The Village of New Lenox was officially created on October 4, 1946. In 1945, 46 community leaders, F. Carlton Cole, Walter Baers and others reasoned that the community should be incorporated. Recognizing the benefits and the potential growth of the area, a community vote in the spring of 1946 resulted in the authorization for the creation of the Village of New Lenox. On October 4, 1946, the State of Illinois officially certified that New Lenox was legally organized and incorporated as a Village in the State of Ill

In 1829, fur traders Aaron Friend and Joseph Brown established an outpost along the north side of Hickory Creek (near today’s Gougar Road), which was one of the earliest settlements in Will County. Friend moved west with the Native Americans after the Blackhawk War of 1832. In 1830, William Rice, Sr. and William Rice, Jr. arrived and began farming and building a log cabin, which they sold along with their land to John Gougar on behalf of his father William Gougar. In 1832, “Uncle Billy” Gougar established a post office at his farm where area residents would pick up their mail. The Gougar farm became the center of activity in the area.

Joseph Norman, who opened the second area sawmill in 1833, was also the father of Elizabeth Norman, born in 1832, and was the first child born in New Lenox Township. In 1852, the coming of the Rock Island Railroad changed the settlement of the Township. Before the railroad, farmers hauled their goods to the I &amp; M Canal or by wagon all the way to larger cities like Chicago. The railroad brought distant markets to the farmer, along with more visitors and the mail. Later three additional railroads: the Wabash, the Michigan Central, and the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern all crossed New Lenox Township. Gradually the area east of Gougar Crossing along the railroad tracks became the new center of town and so the Village of New Lenox began.

The village was platted in 1858. The name Tracy was the name shown on the original plat to honor the general superintendent of the Rock Island Railroad. Tracy requested that another name be found. The first supervisor for New Lenox Township J. Van Duser had named the Township New Lenox from the town of Lenox, New York, which was Van Duser&#x27;s home town. In 1863, the name for the new settlement officially became New Lenox after the Township. The coming of the Rock Island Railroad in 1852 changed the settlement of the Township considerably. Previously farmers could do &quot;cash crop&quot; farming by hauling the products to the I &amp; M Canal or by wagon all the way to larger cities like Chicago. The presence of the railroad brought distant markets to the farmer. Eventually New Lenox Township was served by three additional railroads: the Wabash, the Michigan Central, and the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern.

The most prominent citizen of New Lenox at the turn of the century was H. N. Higinbotham. Although Mr. Higinbotham&#x27;s home was located in New Lenox, he became famous in Chicago where he was a partner in Marshall Field&#x27;s, a banker, and the organizing and supervising force behind the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893. He was a colleague and friend of most of Chicago&#x27;s leaders, including George Pullman, Marshall Field, and the Palmers. Mr. Higinbotham once owned the farms that later became Pilcher Park. He owned and operated one of the largest carnation and rose greenhouse businesses in this area. In 1898, the first rural Bell telephone company in Illinois came to New Lenox. By 1905, there were 132 subscribers. The switchboard operators worked in homes so that 24 hour service could be given to customers to handle emergencies. The Deadmore home at 221 Haven Avenue was the first location for the switchboard.

New Lenox is known as &quot;The Home of Proud Americans&quot;, which exemplifies the quality of life in the community.

==Economy==
The crossroads of I-355, Route 6, and Cedar Road was intended as the future site of two major development projects; Cedar Crossings and Spring Creek Outlets. Cedar Crossings would have been constructed at southwest corner of Cedar Road and Route 6, adjacent to Silver Cross Hospital. Cedar Crossings proposed a 970,000-square-foot retail center to be developed by the Zaremba Group. Sadly, development of Cedar Crossings delayed due to economic reasons. Also proposed was Spring Creek Outlets. Spring Creek Outlets would have been a 65 acer Outlet Mall with additions including senior housing, hotels, restaurants, medical offices, and more. This would have extended Route 6, but was delayed and cut also due to economic reasons.
