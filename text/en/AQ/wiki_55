==History==
When gold was discovered in the East Kootenays of British Columbia in 1863, thousands of prospectors from all over the West surged northward over a route that became known as the Wildhorse Trail. Edwin Bonner, a merchant from Walla Walla, Washington, established a ferry in 1864 where the trail crossed the broad Kootenai River. In 1875, Richard Fry, and his Sinixt wife, Justine Su-steel Fry, leased the business, but the location retained the name of the original founder and later became the town of Bonners Ferry.

Before the gold rush, only a few visitors had come to the region; one of the first was explorer David Thompson, a cartographer for the North West Company. Thompson and four fellow fur traders arrived in 1808 to trade with the Lower Kootenais. The local natives gave Thompson&#x27;s party dried fish and moss bread. Thompson returned the next year and established a trading post on Lake Pend Oreille. He was followed in 1846 by Jesuit Priest Father DeSmet, a missionary to the Kootenai Tribe.

The Oregon Question was settled by the Oregon Treaty of 1846 which established the 49th Parallel north as the boundary between the US and British North America. Government surveyors of the Boundary Commission came in 1858 to establish the border between the United States and British Columbia.

Bonners Ferry in the 1880s flourished due to the mines in the north. Entering service in 1883 the Norwegian-built steamer &quot;Midge&quot; transported passengers and freight between Bonners Ferry and British Columbia for 25 years. In 1892 The Great Northern Railway was built, followed by the Spokane International and the Kootenai Valley lines.

The village of Bonners Ferry was formally established in 1893, along the south bank of the Kootenai River. Scattered along the valley and benchland were a few ranches and homesteads. Numerous mines were developed in the nearby mountains, including the Continental Mine in the Selkirks. The lumber industry also grew rapidly. Bonners Ferry, perched on stilts to avoid the inevitable spring floods, appeared to be a boom town.

Moving into the 20th century, the town became the center of a lumbering and farming community. The valley land was drained, levees were constructed and farms were cleared on the benches. The rich Kootenai Valley became known as the &quot;Nile of the North,&quot; while the Bonners Ferry Lumber Company grew to be one of the world&#x27;s largest lumber mills. The downtown took shape as brick buildings were constructed, replacing those on stilts. Completion of the Libby Dam in 1975 lessened the threat of serious flooding. Today, much of Main Street dates from this initial period of solid, permanent construction.

On September 20, 1974, the Kootenai Tribe, headed by chairwoman Amy Trice, declared war on the United States government. Their first act was to post soldiers on each end of the highway that runs through the town who would ask people to pay a toll to drive through what had been the tribe&#x27;s aboriginal land. The money would be used to house and care for elderly tribal members. Most tribes in the United States are forbidden to declare war on the U.S. government because of treaties, but the Kootenai Tribe never signed a treaty. The dispute resulted in the concession by the United States government and a land grant of that is now the Kootenai Reservation.

Bonners Ferry is 8 miles (13 km) from the site of the Ruby Ridge confrontation and siege in 1992, which occurred just outside Naples, Idaho.

<text>Arco is a city in Butte County, Idaho, United States. The population was 879 as of the 2020 United States census, down from 995 at the 2010 census. Arco is the county seat and largest city in Butte County.

== History ==
Arco was named as early as 1860 based on the name of a local rancher, Louis Arco. Louis Arco is also mentioned in the National Park Service’s Teacher&#x27;s Guide to Craters of the Moon with the line “[around] 1862 Louis Arco establishe[d] a ranch and trading post at Arco.&quot; 

Arco was the first community in the world ever to be lit by electricity generated solely by nuclear power. This occurred for about an hour on July 17, 1955, powered by Argonne National Laboratory’s BORAX-III reactor at the nearby National Reactor Testing Station (NRTS), now the Idaho National Laboratory. NRTS made further history on January 3, 1961, when the SL-1 reactor was destroyed through an operator maintenance error, with the ensuing steam explosion causing the deaths of all three personnel present. It was the world&#x27;s first and the United States&#x27; only fatal reactor accident.

== Economy ==
The town&#x27;s economic base is primarily derived from the Idaho National Laboratory (formerly the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory or INEL), agricultural products, and recreation in the Lost River Valley.

==Highways==
* US 20 — to Mountain Home (west) and Idaho Falls (east)

<doc id="110651" wikidata="Q849592" url="?curid=110651" title="Caldwell, Idaho">
<text>Caldwell (locally CALL-dwel) is a city in and the county seat of Canyon County, Idaho, United States. The population was 59,996 at the time of the 2020 United States census, making it the 5th most populous city in Idaho.

Caldwell is considered part of the Boise metropolitan area. Caldwell is the location of the College of Idaho.

==History==
The present-day location of Caldwell is located along a natural passageway to the Inland and Pacific Northwest. Native American tribes from the west coast, north Idaho and as far away as Colorado would come to the banks of the Boise River for annual trading fairs, or rendezvous. European and some Hawaiian explorers and traders soon followed the paths left by Native Americans and hopeful emigrants later forged the Oregon Trail and followed the now hardened paths to seek a better life in the Oregon Territory. Pioneers of the Trail traveled along the Boise River to Canyon Hill and forded the river close to the Silver Bridge on Plymouth Street.

During the Civil War, the discovery of gold in Idaho&#x27;s mountains brought a variety of new settlers into the area. Many never made it to the mines but chose to settle along the Boise River and run ferries, stage stations, and freighting businesses. These early entrepreneurs created small ranches and farms in the river valleys. Caldwell&#x27;s inception occurred largely as a result of the construction of the Oregon Short Line Railroad, which connected Wyoming to Oregon through Idaho. Robert E. Strahorn came to the Boise River Valley in 1883 to select a route for the railroad. He rejected the grade into Boise City as too steep and chose a site thirty miles to the west. He drove a stake into an alkali flat of sagebrush and greasewood and the City of Caldwell was platted. Caldwell was named after one of Strahorn&#x27;s business partners, Alexander Caldwell, a former Senator from the State of Kansas.

When Caldwell was platted in August 1883, its founder, the Idaho and Oregon Land Improvement Company, started persuading settlers and businessmen to move to the area. Within four months, Caldwell had 600 residents living in 150 dwellings, 40 businesses in operation, a school, a telephone exchange and two newspapers. On January 15, 1890, the Board of Commissioners of Ada County issued a handwritten order incorporating the City of Caldwell. The College of Idaho was founded in Caldwell in 1891 and still is in existence today. In 1892, Canyon County was established from a portion of Ada County, and Caldwell was named the county seat. Irrigation canals and waterways were constructed throughout Canyon County. These facilities provided the foundation for an agricultural based economy in Caldwell. The Oregon Short Line Railroad became part of the larger Union Pacific Railroad network and in 1906 the Caldwell freight and passenger depot was constructed. Caldwell experienced moderate growth as an agricultural processing, commercial retail and educational center during the twentieth century.

In 2009, the City of Caldwell completed a revitalization project to restore Indian Creek, which runs through downtown Caldwell, but had been used for sewage disposal by local industries, and had been covered over. The restored creek includes suspended bridges, walkways and picnic tables.

<text>Nampa () is the most populous city in Canyon County, Idaho, United States. The population was 100,200 at the 2020 census. It is Idaho&#x27;s third-most populous city. Nampa is about west of Boise along Interstate 84, and west of Meridian. It is the second principal city of the Boise metropolitan area. The name &quot;Nampa&quot; may have come from a Shoshoni word meaning or . According to toponymist William O. Bright, the name comes from the Shoshoni word /nampai/, meaning &quot;foot&quot;.

==History==
Nampa had its beginnings in the early 1880s when the Oregon Short Line Railroad built a line from Granger, Wyoming, to Huntington, Oregon, that passed through Nampa. In Nampa there is a history museum that marks the railroad&#x27;s significance. More railroad lines sprang up through Nampa, making it an important railroad town. Alexander and Hannah Duffes established one of the town&#x27;s first homesteads, eventually forming the Nampa Land and Improvement Company with the help of their friend and co-founder, James McGee. Despite the name, many early settlers called the town &quot;New Jerusalem&quot; because of its citizens&#x27; strong religious focus. After only a year the town grew from 15 homes to 50. As amenities were added, Nampa continued to grow, and it was incorporated in 1891.

Downtown Nampa&#x27;s street grid is oriented with the railroad tracks, which run northwest–southeast; As the Oregon Short Line railroad originally bypassed Boise, Nampa has the fanciest of many railroad depots built in the area.

The first elementary school was built in the 1890s. Lakeview School was on a hill on 6th Street and 12th Avenue North, with a view of Lake Ethel. Just after the school&#x27;s centennial celebration, it was condemned as a school and sold to the First Mennonite Church. In 2008 the building was refurbished, and it is now used by the Idaho Arts Charter School.

Lake Ethel, an irrigation reservoir, had long been the site of community picnics, and many citizens fished, swam, boated, and even hunted on it and its surrounding property. But the hunting didn&#x27;t last long, as O. F. Persons, owner of the adjoining homestead, took offense when local hunters started shooting his pet ducks.

The city later auctioned off the lake. E. H. Dewey (a former Nampa mayor) was the only bidder. But occasional flooding led to a series of lawsuits from neighbors. Dewey eventually drained Lake Ethel. Not long after, the city council became interested in buying back the Fritz Miller property as well as the Dewey home. Pressure had been building for more than four years. Nampa citizens wanted another park. On August 7, 1924, the city council passed an ordinance to purchase the Miller property and name it Lakeview Park. A bandstand was completed in 1928, and the municipal swimming pool opened on August 13, 1934. It is Nampa&#x27;s largest park and many community celebrations are held there.

Colonel William H. Dewey, a man who made a fortune mining in Silver City, built the Dewey Palace Hotel in 1902 for $250,000. He died in his hotel in 1903, leaving his son $1 million. The hotel survived the great fire of 1909, which burned several blocks of downtown Nampa, but was razed in 1963 after redevelopment plans failed. Relics from the hotel such as the chandelier and the hotel safe can be found at the Canyon County Historical Museum, which is in the old train depot on Front Street and Nampa City Hall. After demolition the location on First Street between 11th and 12th Ave. South was sold to private enterprise, including a bank and tire store, replacing this building with modern structures. A public-use postage stamp sized park was later placed across the street from the old palace property as a collaboration between the Downtown Alliance of Nampa (the local business council) and an Eagle Scout Project for the Boy Scouts of America. The park includes a large mural/wall sculpture of running horses commissioned for the project.

A Carnegie library was built downtown in 1908; it burned down after the library moved in 1966. Nampa Public Library was then on the corner of 1st Street and 11th Avenue South in the old bank building. A new library, on 12th Avenue South, opened in 2015.

Deer Flat Reservoir, an offstream irrigation storage reservoir, was constructed by the United States Bureau of Reclamation between 1906 and 1911. Known locally as Lake Lowell, it is surrounded by the Deer Flat National Wildlife Refuge, established in 1909 by President Theodore Roosevelt. The refuge is administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Lake Lowell is filled by the concrete New York Canal; the water is diverted from the Boise River a few miles below Lucky Peak Dam.

In 1910, the Idaho State School and Hospital was built northwest of Nampa for the state&#x27;s developmentally challenged population. It opened in 1918. The institution was largely self-sufficient, with a large farm staffed by the residents. The higher-functioning residents also cared for residents who could not care for themselves. The land for the farm was sold and is now golf courses (Centennial and Ridgecrest), and the residents no longer give primary care to other residents. The institution is modernized and remains in operation, though a few of the oldest buildings now house juvenile offenders.

Nampa held an annual harvest festival and farmers&#x27; market from about 1908, a time of celebration and community fun. From this festival emerged the Snake River Stampede Rodeo in 1937, which continues to this day. It is one of the top 12 rodeos in the pro rodeo circuits.

In 1913, a local congregation of the Church of the Nazarene built a small elementary school, which became to Northwest Nazarene College in 1915 and finally Northwest Nazarene University. The university has 2,500 undergraduate and graduate students.

Karcher Mall opened in 1965, the first enclosed shopping mall in the Treasure Valley. It was &quot;the place to gather&quot; for several decades until the Boise Towne Square mall was built in Boise in 1988, drawing business away. Karcher Mall was renamed District 208 in 2022.

The Idaho Press-Tribune is the local newspaper for the Canyon County area. Since early 2009, the facility has been the contract printer for The Idaho Statesman, whose antiquated press equipment was retired and not replaced.

<doc id="110660" wikidata="Q595787" url="?curid=110660" title="Grace, Idaho">
<text>Grace is a city in Caribou County, Idaho, United States. The population was 920 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The area of Grace was once inhabited by the Shoshone Indians. The Oregon Trail passed within of Grace and the town itself was established with a post office in 1894. Unlike other nearby historic towns such as Paris and Franklin, Grace was not originally settled by Mormon pioneers, but has since become a predominantly Mormon-populated town. The economy in and around Grace has traditionally been driven by agriculture, with potatoes, alfalfa, grain, dairy and ranching being the main staples.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

Grace is one of the northernmost cities along the Wasatch Range which extends approximately south, and is only west of the large fault line that defines the range. Grace is located near the center of Gem Valley.

In stark contrast to the surrounding mountains, the valley floor in the immediate area of Grace is flat due to volcanic activity in the area some 30,000 years ago. The lava flow that created the valley also diverted the Bear River from its Pacific drainage into the Great Basin. This was a significant contributor to the growth of the prehistoric Lake Bonneville of which the Great Salt Lake is a remnant. Lake Bonneville reached its farthest north advance about four miles (6 km) southwest of Grace before it broke through the earthen barrier at Red Rock pass north of Preston, Idaho. The Bear River today runs to the north and west of Grace and terminates in the Great Salt Lake.

Grace&#x27;s neighboring towns are Soda Springs to the north east, Bancroft to the north west, and Preston to the south. It is about from Lava Hot Springs, which is a local tourism and recreation destination. The nearest city with a major airport is Salt Lake City, Utah, which is approximately south.

===Climate===
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winter. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Grace has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Soda Springs is a city in Caribou County, Idaho, United States. Its population was 3,133 at the time of the 2020 census. The city has been the county seat of Caribou County since the county was organized in 1919. In the 1860s, Soda Springs served as the seat of Oneida County.

==History==
The city is named for the hundreds of natural springs of carbonated water that are located in and around the city. The springs were known to Native Americans, and were a landmark along the Oregon Trail in the middle 19th century. The city is also the location of the Soda Springs Geyser, which was unleashed in 1937 when town fathers were seeking hot water for a hot pool bathing attraction. They drilled into a chamber of highly pressurized carbon dioxide gas and cold water, and the geyser erupted. After running for weeks and flooding the downtown area it was capped and then manually released, at first upon request, as a tourist attraction. More recently a timed release valve opens every hour on the hour. The geyser&#x27;s height and volume have not decreased in the decades since. Viewing platforms are located at either end of the travertine mound where the geyser erupts. Interpretive signs are located on the platforms explaining the phenomenon.

Soda Springs is also the location of one of the Ground Observer Corps sites.

<text>Burley () is a city in Cassia and Minidoka counties in southern Idaho, United States. The population was 11,704 at the 2020 census, up from 10,345 in 2010. The city is the county seat of Cassia County.

Burley is the principal city of the Burley, Idaho, Micropolitan Statistical Area, which comprises Cassia and Minidoka counties. Burley is the largest city in Cassia and Minidoka counties (collectively called the “Mini-Cassia” area), and the third-largest city in Idaho&#x27;s Magic Valley region after Twin Falls, and Jerome.

==History==
The first human inhabitants of the area were Paleo Indians, who first settled the area 15 to 16,000 years ago. Later, the Northern Shoshone and Northern Paiute peoples established communities in the area.

Oregon Trail passed through what is now Burley, and the California Trail passed just south, through the City of Rocks nearby. (The “parting of the ways” trail junction was at the convergence of the Raft and Snake rivers in eastern Cassia county.) The Oregon Short Line Railroad was constructed through what is now Burley, following the Oregon Trail, in the late 1800s.

A post office called Burley has been in operation since 1905. The community was named after David Ellsworth Burley, the local railroad agent. The town was incorporated in 1909, and became the seat of Cassia County in 1918.

In 1984, the Lower Goose Creek Reservoir (Oakley Reservoir) came very close to overtopping its dam after historic rain and snowfall. Burley was considered to be at risk of flooding if the reservoir was breached. To provide a safe water outlet, hundreds of local volunteers and the Army Corps of Engineers dug a 17-mile long, 70-foot wide diversion channel across private property in 4 days. The possible flood and diversion efforts were covered by the national news program, &quot;The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour&quot; (now PBS NewsHour) and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

A Simplot potato-processing plant in nearby Heyburn employed about 650 residents in the area and was a mainstay of the local economy, from its opening in 1960, through its closure in 2003. After the plant&#x27;s closure, the city of Burley took ownership of the property. It currently operates an industrial park there. In the aftermath of the plant closure, voters in Burley, Rupert, and Heyburn approved bond issues to expand and upgrade wastewater infrastructure. This allowed other food processing companies to come to the area, which in turn stabilized and diversified the local economy.

In 2008, a group of local farmers sued the Idaho BLM (Bureau of Land Management) because pesticides that the Burley BLM office sprayed on their lands were carried by a wind storm onto farmers’ lands, effectively destroying crops.

==Economy==
Agriculture and food processing play a critical role in the economy of Burley and the surrounding area. Burley is part of the broader Magic Valley region, known for its dairy and crop production. McCain Foods, a leading producer of frozen potato products, has a processing plant in Burley. The Amalgamated Sugar Company, which processes sugar beets, also runs a plant outside of nearby Paul, while Dot Foods operates a distribution plant in Burley. High Desert Milk, a Burley-based cooperative, is one of Idaho&#x27;s leading dairy processors; in 2021, they underwent a $50 million expansion at their Burley facility. A local business, Suntado, built a new multimillion dollar shelf-stable milk factory in Burley around 2023.

Another major sector of Burley’s economy is banking. D. L. Evans Bank, a regional bank with $2.9 billion in assets is headquartered in Burley. Key Bank, Zions Bank, US Bank, Idaho Central Credit Union, First Federal Savings Bank, and Wells Fargo all also operate branch offices in Burley.

The city owns and operates the Burley Municipal Airport. In recent years, there have been proposals to replace the airport with a new facility, as the existing airport faces funding and safety issues. However, plans to move the airport have faced some local opposition and challenges securing funding.

==Geography==
Most of the city lies in Cassia County, with a small portion extending north into Minidoka County. The Snake River forms the border between the two counties. On the north side of the river, Burley is bordered to the east by the city of Heyburn.

U.S. Route 30 passes east-west through the center of Burley, leading northeast to Interstate 84 in Heyburn and west to Kimberly. Idaho State Highway 27 passes through the center of Burley, leading north to Paul and south to its terminus in Oakley, while State Highway 81 leads east from Burley to Declo. I-84 passes through the northern end of Burley, leading west to the Twin Falls area and southeast to Ogden, Utah. Replacements and upgrades to the I-84 interchanges outside of Burley and nearby Heyburn are under construction, to be completed around 2026; the previous interchanges had been in service since their construction in 1961.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Burley has a total area of , of which are land and , or 4.71%, are water, referring to the Snake River.

<text>Orofino ; (&quot;fine gold&quot; [ore] in Spanish) is a city in and the county seat of Clearwater County, Idaho, United States, along Orofino Creek and the north bank of the Clearwater River. It is the major city within the Nez Perce Indian Reservation. The population was 3,142 at the time of the 2010 census.

Nearby is the historical &quot;Canoe Camp,&quot; where the Lewis and Clark expedition built five new dugout canoes and embarked on October 7, 1805, downstream to the Pacific Ocean. Some north is the Dworshak Dam, third-highest dam in the United States, completed in the early 1970s. Nearby is the Dworshak National Fish Hatchery, started to try to compensate for the loss of migratory fish upstream after the dam was constructed.

Originally the name was two words, Oro Fino, applied to a gold mining camp established in 1861 south of Pierce. When the United States government opened up the Nez Percé reservation to non-tribal settlers in 1895, thousands of European Americans rushed to lay claims to land. Clifford Fuller set up a trading post on his new homestead. The town (Orofino-on-the-Clearwater) was established the next year. The railroad, later part of the Camas Prairie Railroad, was constructed from Lewiston in 1899.

Orofino is home to state institutions: Idaho State Hospital North and the Idaho Correctional Institution–Orofino. These two facilities are located adjacent to Orofino High School, which includes the junior high or middle school grades, and whose mascot is the Maniac.

Orofino hosts an annual July 4 celebration, as well as the Clearwater County Fair and Lumberjack Days in late summer. Each spring, Boomershoot, an annual precision rifle event, is held nearby.

<text>Pierce is a city in the northwest United States, located in Clearwater County, Idaho. The population was 508 at the 2010 census, down from 617 in 2000.

==History==
The first discovery of gold in Idaho (then Washington Territory) was made by Elias D. Pierce and Wilbur F. Bassett on Orofino Creek (Canal Gulch) in October 1860, a mile (1.6 km) north of Pierce. On land ceded to the Nez Perce people at the Walla Walla Council in 1855 (with a 1859 treaty), the gold discovery led to significant reduction of that agreement in 1863, and the Nez Perce War in 1877.

Pierce was the first county seat for Shoshone County, which was established in January 1861 in Washington Territory and for most of its first year included most of present-day Idaho and Wyoming. The Pierce Courthouse, constructed in 1862, is Idaho&#x27;s oldest public building. Idaho Territory was established in 1863, and the county seat moved north to the Silver Valley in Murray in 1884 (and to Wallace in 1898). Present-day Clearwater County, formed in 1911, was part of Shoshone County until 1904, when it was annexed by Nez Perce County.

==History==
Fur trappers of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company discovered the Stanley Basin in the 1820s, but it was mostly avoided due to scarcity of beaver.

The site was not considered a town until 1919 when its streets and lots were surveyed and recorded.

Stanley has long been a gathering place for the sparsely populated region.

In 2005, Hannah Stauts won the city&#x27;s mayoral election at age 22 to become the state&#x27;s youngest elected mayor.

==History==
Glenns Ferry was one of the most famous and treacherous river crossings on the Oregon Trail. Pioneers forded the Snake River at the Three Island Crossing until 1869, when Gustavus &quot;Gus&quot; Glenn constructed a ferry about two miles upstream, primarily to expedite freight but also for emigrants. His boat, which could hold two wagons, cut nearly twenty miles from the former route. In 1871 the city of Glenns Ferry was established. Construction of the Oregon Short Line Railroad through the town in 1883 gave the city its first major employer.

Opened in 1971, Three Island Crossing State Park is home to The Oregon Trail History and Education Center, where visitors can learn about pioneer emigrants and Native American history. The Glenns Ferry community sponsors a crossing commemoration the second Saturday of each August.

The Glenns Ferry townsite was platted in 1871, just downstream from the ferry site. It is one of just two incorporated cities in Elmore County, along with Mountain Home.

Its political status remained ambiguous until an 1872 survey determined the townsite was in Idaho Territory about north of the Utah Territory border. The area within the town limits was platted into square blocks in 1864.

Part of the 2004 comedy film &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; were shot near Franklin. The chicken farm scenes were filmed on Ritewood Egg Farms property, and the supervisor&#x27;s character is loosely based on Marlow Woodward, a late Franklin resident and one of the farm&#x27;s founders.

==History==
The Bear River Massacre occurred in 1863 at a point a few miles northwest of Preston. The Bear River Massacre Site is a National Historic Landmark.

In 1866, Latter-day Saint pioneers arrived in the northern end of the Cache Valley, stretching across southeastern Idaho and northeastern Utah. They founded a community in that location and named it Worm Creek, but in 1881 changed it to Preston because leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Salt Lake City objected to the name &quot;Worm Creek&quot; being part of any church congregation&#x27;s name. The name Preston was suggested by a local member to honor William B. Preston, who at the time was president of the LDS Church&#x27;s Cache Stake.

It was not until the 1880s while William C. Parkinson was serving as the bishop of the Preston LDS Ward that a regular townsite was laid out.

<text>Ashton is a city in Fremont County, Idaho, United States. The population was 1,127 at the 2010 census, and it is part of the Rexburg Micropolitan Statistical Area. The district is noted for seed potato production and bills itself as the world&#x27;s largest seed potato growing area.

==History==
===Railroad===

In 1900, the Union Pacific Railroad, under the careful watch of the Oregon Short Line (OSL) and St. Anthony Railroad Company, brought the railroad into the Upper Snake River Valley from Idaho Falls to St. Anthony, Idaho, southwest of what became Ashton. The venture had considerable local support and official support from the LDS Church. Following successful construction and operation of the St. Anthony Railroad, Union Pacific, under the careful watch of the OSL and the Yellowstone Park Railroad Company, began plans for another railroad from St. Anthony to the Madison River entrance of Yellowstone National Park or to what is now known as West Yellowstone. For years, Union Pacific wanted improved rail access to Yellowstone&#x27;s geyser basins and to Old Faithful Inn, that opened in 1904. Old Faithful Inn was only from the Madison River entrance, nearly half the distance from the Northern Entrance at Gardiner, Montana that was served by the Northern Pacific Railroad. The planned route for the new railroad was through Marysville, up Warm River Canyon into the forested Island Park country, and on over the Continental Divide at Rea&#x27;s Pass into what became West Yellowstone.

Despite the obvious economic advantages and support, the residents of Marysville, perfectly happy without a railroad, resisted the new railroad intruding upon their land and into their lives. The matter was expeditiously resolved when Union Pacific decided to build the railroad through a new town one mile (1.6 km) west of Marysville named after the OSL Chief Engineer, William Ashton. The founding of Ashton and the first scheduled train service to Ashton both occurred in 1906 with predictable results. Ashton quickly sprang to life while Marysville slowly declined into near oblivion. One of the two founding fathers, H. G. &quot;Fess&quot; Fuller, became the long-time Mayor of Ashton and the other, Charles C. Moore, went on to become Governor of Idaho.

The Yellowstone Branch, as the new railroad was known, was very unusual in that it was built primarily for passenger service and secondarily for freight. Aesthetic stone depots, rather than standard wooden ones, were built at Rexburg, Idaho, and at West Yellowstone to lure and impress tourists traveling to Yellowstone National Park and Old Faithful Inn. In addition to regular freight and passenger service, there were two special named trains, the &quot;Yellowstone Special&quot; and the &quot;Yellowstone Express&quot;, that ran to West Yellowstone in the summer tourist season. From Ashton north, the railroad was never plowed of snow, except in spring, so that Ashton became the wintertime rail terminus for the entire region.

===Development===
Beginning in 1910, Ashton was the railhead used for the construction of Jackson Lake Dam in Grand Teton National Park by the Bureau of Reclamation. For several years, materials and equipment were freighted by wagon from the Reclamation Building in Ashton to the dam site at Moran, Wyoming on what was known as the Ashton-Moran Road or Reclamation Road, as the locals called it, that ran over the north end of the Teton Range. Union Pacific then built the Teton Valley Branch railroad to Driggs and Victor from Ashton and completed in 1912. They built an engine house and other railroad facilities in Ashton to service the Teton Valley Branch and the Yellowstone Branch. These and further developments in the area soon made Ashton prosper and become one of the more important towns in Eastern Idaho.

American Dog Derby

Ashton, being at the head of the Snake River Plain and at the end of the Yellowstone moisture channel, has 20 inches of precipitation annually (according to usclimatedata.com). Not as much snow as the typical ski town in Colorado as Crested Butte gets over 40 inches in January alone (according to usclimatedata.com). See &quot;Effects on Climate&quot; in article &quot;Snake River Plain&quot;). Ashton was also the wintertime rail terminus for the region and where there was considerable development in the higher country north and east of Ashton, there arose a need for wintertime travel to the snowbound areas around Ashton. People began using the only wintertime transportation available at the time...dogsled. There became several accomplished mushers in the area whose livelihood became their dog teams. The many mushers, dog teams and their abilities were fun topics of conversation and it was not long before a race was organized that, by fate, would become the world-famous American Dog Derby.

The legend goes that a few of the boys were socializing in the barbershop one quiet winter day when Jay Ball, a beloved Ashton businessman, hatched his idea of a dog race after reading about dog races held in Alaska and Canada. The idea resonated with local mushers and businessmen alike and the first race, a simple run down the unplowed Yellowstone Branch from West Yellowstone to Ashton, was held on March 4, 1917. A blizzard held up the finish making spectators wait two days to see what was supposed to be a one-day race, but it was enough of a success that it was promoted and held again the following year. Union Pacific Railroad, always advancing their interests, helped to promote the races. The second race, designed to be more spectator friendly, was held in the open fields around Ashton on a figure-eight course with Ashton at the intersection so that teams would come running through town twice each lap. Interest in the American Dog Derby grew. Union Pacific brought spectators in special trains and by the early twenties, thousands of people thronged the streets of Ashton each February to see mushers and dogs come charging down Main Street on one of their laps. It may have been Ashton&#x27;s beautiful view of the Tetons, it may have been the happy cast of characters involved, but for whatever reason, by 1923, the American Dog Derby had captured the imagination of the western world. Newspaper correspondents and newsreel cameramen came from distant cities seeking the inside story of the American Dog Derby while crowds grew to 10,000 or more people in this town of less than two thousand. Winning mushers became celebrities and some became wealthy. A female musher nicknamed Whistling Lyd toured the United States and Canada, appeared in a movie, and may have been on her way to being a movie star when she died of pneumonia in 1930. The buildup to and the results of the American Dog Derby were reported by newspapers and by newsreels in the Americas, in Europe, and elsewhere. Ashton was dubbed, “the best known American town in the world.”

Seed potatoes
Ashton was first and foremost a farming community, as the soil of the area is rich and the water is plentiful. Shortly after the first settlers arrived in the 1890s, several canals were developed to divert water from streams running off the Yellowstone Plateau and Teton Range. Some farmland, mostly to the east, is high enough and close enough to the Teton Range that crops can grow without irrigation due to increased rainfall. The relatively high altitude limited crops to those requiring a short growing season such as grain and alfalfa. Seed potatoes were not tried as a crop until 1920 but as it turns out, the area is perfect for seed potatoes. The short growing season keeps the potatoes desirably small, and the long, cold winters create the ideal conditions for seed. The longtime enemy to potato farming is potato blight, a form of mold that reproduces from spores in the soil and sickens the potato plant. Ashton&#x27;s winters clean the soil of these mold spores with a long, deep and killing freeze. Potato blight never spreads because the soil is clean and free of spores each spring. After realizing this, farmers organized, hired inspectors, and began selling certified seed potatoes giving buyers comfort that Ashton seed was free of molds and disease. This enabled them to demand a premium price for these potatoes grown in the clean soils around Ashton and the area quickly became the largest seed potato producing area in the world as it is still known today.

==Geography and climate==

Ashton is located at an elevation of above mean sea level.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

Ashton is from the southwest corner of Yellowstone National Park, from Grand Teton National Park and from the Grand Teton with a clear view. Ashton is surrounded by farmland but is less than five miles (8 km) from the Targhee National Forest. There are four rivers within of Ashton, and all are outstanding trout streams: the Henrys Fork of the Snake River, Fall River, the Teton River and Warm River. Also nearby are three notable waterfalls: Upper Mesa Falls and Lower Mesa Falls, both on the Henrys Fork, and Cave Falls on Fall River.

===Moisture channel===
Ashton&#x27;s climate is unique and distinct relative to most of the U.S. northern Intermountain West. Ashton&#x27;s annual precipitation, at , is among the highest in southern Idaho and yet Ashton is not in the mountains. Further, the areas five miles (8 km) north or five miles (8 km) east of Ashton receive over of precipitation while St. Anthony, only to the southwest, receives only . This unusually high precipitation in the Ashton area is due to the geography of southern Idaho and Yellowstone. The Snake River Plain, formed by the Yellowstone hotspot across southern Idaho, creates a moisture channel that extends from the Pacific Ocean to the Ashton and Yellowstone area. Average monthly precipitation in Ashton shows a transitional regime. Precipitation peaks first in December–January, reflecting influence from Pacific Ocean-originating storms during the winter season, and second in May and June, reflecting showers and thunderstorms that create a May/June rainfall peak that prevails in nearby Montana and Wyoming. Ashton has relatively drier summers (July/August). This area marks the virtually easternmost extremity of the typical Pacific Northwest annual precipitation pattern, with its dry summers. According to the Köppen climate classification, Ashton has a dry-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dsb&quot;).

<text>Island Park is a city in Fremont County, Idaho, United States. The city&#x27;s population was 286 at the 2010 census, up from 215 in 2000. The city was incorporated by owners of the many lodges and resorts along U.S. Route 20 in 1947, primarily to circumvent Idaho&#x27;s liquor laws that prohibited the sale of liquor outside of city limits. It is only wide in most locations and at , claims to have the longest &quot;Main Street&quot; in the world.

Island Park is part of the Rexburg Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==

===City geography===
Island Park is located at an elevation of above sea level, making it the highest city in Idaho.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

===Regional geography===
The area was known as Island Park long before the -long town was incorporated. The area known as Island Park is mostly a large crater or caldera named the Henry&#x27;s Fork Caldera that was created by the same hotspot that created the earlier Island Park Caldera and the later Yellowstone Caldera.
In addition to the portion which lies on the Henry&#x27;s Fork Caldera, about a third of what is known as Island Park is north of the caldera, extending across Henry&#x27;s Lake Flat and Henry&#x27;s Lake towards the Idaho/Montana border. Henry&#x27;s Lake Flat is a flat bottomed valley between high mountain ranges, with Henrys Lake at the northwest end of the flats. Mount Jefferson, south of Henry&#x27;s Lake, is high and Targhee Peak, north of Henrys Lake is high. The most famous of Island Park&#x27;s peaks, however, is the Sawtell Peak, south of Henrys Lake near Mount Jefferson. The peak is known for its beauty and is named for a perceived resemblance to a Native American chief&#x27;s profile while napping. The peak has also been called Chief Rains in the Face. Sawtell Peak is topped by a FAA radar dome and is visible from nearly anywhere in Island Park.

Although much smaller than either the Island Park Caldera or the Yellowstone Caldera, the Henry&#x27;s Fork Caldera is still one of the largest calderas in the world and is the only large caldera in the Yellowstone region that is plainly visible. It has a nearly level wide circular floor that slopes slightly towards the southeast. The caldera floor is at about of elevation with the rim generally being several hundred feet higher. The Henry&#x27;s Lake Flat area, north of the caldera, is a little higher. Henry&#x27;s Lake sits at about , with the flats sloping slightly southward towards the caldera.

The Island Park area is mostly forested with many meadows and grasslands. It is mostly level, but is surrounded by forested hills and high mountains in the north. The Henrys Fork of the Snake River meanders through Island Park with its headwaters at Henry&#x27;s Lake and at Big Springs (Idaho). The Henry&#x27;s Fork is impounded by Island Park Dam to form Island Park Reservoir outside the north rim of the caldera. In fact, the entire south bank of Island Park Reservoir is formed by the northern slope of the caldera. The Henry&#x27;s Fork crosses through the caldera and then cascades off from it at Upper and Lower Mesa Falls.
The geography of Island Park is actually unique and distinctive. It is largely flat and it has unusually high precipitation. Island Park is at the same elevation as Teton Valley, Idaho, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, or the Centennial Valley, Montana; yet while these nearby areas are semi-arid prairie or even desert areas receiving less than of precipitation annually, Island Park is forested and green with many streams, ponds, lakes, and meadows. Island Park receives well over of precipitation annually, with parts receiving over . That is, Island Park has three times the rainfall and snowfall as nearby areas of the same elevation.

The Snake River Plain that was also formed by the Yellowstone hotspot aligns with the gap between the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges along the West Coast of the United States so that there is a moisture channel that extends from the distant Pacific Ocean, between the Cascades and Sierra Nevada, through the Rocky Mountains to Island Park.

This abundant precipitation in Island Park falls on the relatively level floor of the caldera, where it forms numerous meandering streams, ponds, marshes, and meadows. It also falls on the higher areas to the east along the Yellowstone Park border, where it percolates though the granular volcanic deposits to emerge as some of the largest springs in the world. Big Springs, Buffalo River Springs, and Warm River Springs all are 1st Magnitude springs, and they form some of the crystal-clear meandering streams that the area is famous for.

<doc id="110690" wikidata="Q1509761" url="?curid=110690" title="Newdale, Idaho">
<text>Newdale is a city in Fremont County, Idaho, United States. The population was 337 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Rexburg, Idaho Micropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
In the early 1900s, there were only a few homes and farms scattered across the vast terrain east of Teton City. Early settlers in this area include family names such as Siddoway, Briggs, and Schwendiman. The Schwendiman family, consisting of 6 brothers and their mother, a widow, relocated from Paris Idaho to Teton Idaho in 1894. As the Schwendiman brothers grew older and married, they began to homestead and dry farm in the area east of Newdale, and obtained land in 160 acre parcels via the Homestead Acts. Part of this land includes where the City of Newdale now sits. Many families in this area would live on their farms, working from spring to fall, but would move to Teton or other nearby towns during the winter months.

In 1912, a one-room rock school house was built in Bowerman, an area 2 miles east of present-day Newdale, to accommodate approximately 15 school children living in the surrounding area. The school house was also used for LDS Church meetings. Bowerman may have developed into a village, if had not been for the railroad being built in the Newdale area, which encouraged growth.
The Oregon Short Line Railroad wanted to expand into this part of the country and on June 27, 1914, purchased a right of way from brothers Sam and Fred Schwendiman to lay tracks for a new branch line. The new railroad attracted people to Newdale and in 1914 the Edwin Moroni Stocks family built a house and the Leo Schofield family built a cabin. Mrs. Hansine C. Hansen, a widow, was also one of the first people to move in, and had her sons move her house from Teton, perhaps early in 1915. Burt Garner was also one of the first to build a home and move in, and he also started a grocery store.

Sam and Fred Schwendiman incorporated the Newdale Investment Company for commercial purposes, which erected a rock building that housed, on the ground floor, a hardware supply and drug store. The other part of the building was leased to the First National Bank of Newdale, an independent bank managed by G.C. Alden. Upstairs, a fine recreation hall was completed for dancing, with a stage where operettas and drama productions could be given. The facility formally opened in June 1915 and attracted considerable attention at the time. A train depot was also built in 1915, and catered to both freight and passenger service. Later that summer, in August, a group of men representing the Chamber of Commerce came to Newdale by train and were entertained at this community center before making the loop back to Idaho Falls.

The US Post Office established a Newdale Post Office and on February 15, 1916, appointed Sam Schwendiman as the first post master.
On March 17, 1916, the water system was completed, including a wooden elevated water storage tank and underground wooded water mains. The project cost $15,000 (some records say $18,000).

The Newdale Investment Company made land available for the townsite of Newdale, which was surveyed and plotted by engineers Cotton and Wilson in April 1916. In May, several hundred shade trees, apple trees, and other fruit trees were planted throughout the town. The LDS Newdale Ward was organized on December 17, 1916, with Lester Hanson as the first bishop. School and church meetings were held in a vacant building on Main Street. In 1916, a contract was negotiated with the Utah Power and Light Company, to bring electricity to Newdale. Telephone service came shortly after. The Idaho Falls Daily Post published a notice with headlines that read: &quot;Newdale bright lights beckon to the world. All over the Upper Snake Valley the question has been asked, &#x27;What are these many electric lights we see twinkling up on the bench every night?&#x27;&quot;

The Village of Newdale was incorporated in January 1917. The first town board was: Joseph Fleischman as chairman, Frank Williams as clerk, Burt L. Garner as treasurer, and Edwin Stocks, George Bean, Henry Campeau as board members. In the fall of 1915 an incorporated Company, known as the Farmer&#x27;s Warehouse Company, built a large warehouse in Newdale, which became the shipping point for crops raised in the surrounding area. Sugar beets were the main crop of the area, followed by grains, alfalfa, and seed peas. Potatoes would become the main crop after 1920.

In 1918, the Spanish Influenza hit, and the whole town masked their faces when going out in public. School was let out for the year because of the flu.
The year 1918 produced one of the best crops that has even been produced in this area. Newdale grew rapidly and by 1919, after being only four years old, it had a national bank, a mercantile and drug store, a barber shop, a blacksmith, a carpenter shop, a printing shop, a real estate office, a livery stable, several general stores, lumber yards, hardware stores, implement yards, warehouses, grain elevators, commission houses, hotels, restaurants, and an opera house. It is estimated that Newdale doubled in size in 1919. The value of city lots had raised several times.

The people of Newdale were very progressive and hard workers and had a desire to make the area a truly good place to live. In December 1919, an 8-room, brick school house was completed on a piece of land donated by Sam Schwendiman, where the Newdale City Park is today. Leigh Chantrill was a young boy at the time, and later said: &quot;It was really exciting when the new school house was completed enough so we could use it for school and church meetings&quot;. Its classrooms were heated by wood stove, and had no indoor plumbing. A playground was also built including swings and a baseball diamond. Students would attend school in Newdale from 1st to 8th grade, and then go to school in Teton for freshman and sophomore years, and Sugar City for high school. The Newdale school house was also used for LDS church meetings until a church house was built in 1952.

An agriculture depression in the early 1920s hurt the town, and many families lost their homes and farms to creditors, and were forced to leave Newdale. In 1924, when John Schwendiman was asked to be bishop of the Newdale LDS ward, he said this about the state of the town: “Newdale was half deserted. Some houses had burned down. Others were moved away and several were empty. The town was bonded for over $100,000 for the school house and water works.” The Great Depression of the 1930s had similar negative effects. The beat dump closed down but the potato industry would continue to expand. By 1944, only $1000 had been paid off in principal on the cities debts. The 1940s brought a new generation of farmers, with a lot of thought and effort being put towards irrigation. They used wells and dams. Sprinkler irrigation would double or triple the amount of usable farm land in the area.

An LDS church house was completed and dedicated in 1952.

In 1967, the City of Newdale purchased the Newdale School house and property, which was no longer in use, and turned it into a city park over the next few years. It was also at this time that the streets of Newdale were officially named (from West to East): R.R. Street (Railroad), Main Street, Church Street, Park Street, and Schwendiman Park Road.

A swimming pool was built in Newdale with a new well to supply the water. The pool failed shortly after opening, due to lack of patronage. Newdale wells produce warm water.

Newdale is the nearest city to the Teton Dam, which failed on June 5, 1976. Newdale did not receive any flooding or damage, due to its elevation and position relative to the dam.

==Geography==
Newdale is located one mile below the Teton Dam.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of (134.4 acres), all of it land.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification, Newdale has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dfb&quot;).

==History==
Previous to the foundation of St. Anthony, Major Andrew Henry established a short-lived fort a few miles west of where the city stands today. This post was last used in the Fall of 1811, but left a lasting mark on the area as Henry is the namesake for the Henrys Fork of the Snake River, which St. Anthony sits along.

The early history of the city is disputed, with some sources pointing toward St. Anthony being founded in 1888 by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, while others point to it being established in 1890. About this same time, a bridge was built over the Henrys Fork where St. Anthony stands today. The city was named after Saint Anthony Falls in Minnesota.

The railroad came to St. Anthony in 1899 and the first post office was established in 1901. Charles C. Moore arrived on the first train to the city. He taught school in the city and served as postmaster from 1908 to 1913 before being elected as governor of Idaho in 1922. He later died in St. Anthony at the age of 92.

Early in the life of the city, businesses would close their doors around noon on Wednesday to enjoy a day of rest and for the city&#x27;s ball team to play against those in neighboring towns.

The first LDS Stake to be headquartered in St. Anthony, the Yellowstone Stake, was established in 1909 with David O. McKay presiding at the proceedings. By 1912 the Yellowstone Tabernacle had been erected by the church at a cost of $79,074, which would have cost $1.9 million in 2016.

The first county courthouse was built in 1909, with the first cinema opening in 1911 to show silent films. By 1928 the city had two motion picture theaters, the Rialto and the Rex. The Rialto was the first to bring motion pictures containing audio to St. Anthony.

Today the current post office and the current courthouse are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Emmett is a city in Gem County, Idaho, United States. The population was 6,557 at the 2010 census, up from 5,490 in 2000. It is the county seat and the only city in the county. Emmett is part of the Boise−Nampa, Idaho Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Emmett, ID is a town on the southern bank of the Payette River that grew up around a ferry crossing of the Payette River. Emmett was originally called Martinsville, named after Nathaniel Martin who, along with Jonathan Smith, built the ferry crossing. Next, the name was changed to &quot;Emmettville,&quot; because it was primarily a post office named after Emmett Cahalan, the son of Tom Cahalan, an early settler of the area. The post office was later moved but the town retained the name. A few years later the &quot;ville&quot; was dropped and the post office and town became simply Emmett. In 1883 James Wardwell had the town platted, and in 1900 the town was incorporated as Emmett. Later, in March 1902, the Idaho Northern railroad came to the valley.

After the closing of the mines in 1906, the power lines were extended to Emmett. A series of irrigation projects made it possible for more rapid expansion of the town as the major service center for a farming and fruit-growing valley. In the early 1900s fruit packers adopted the label of &quot;Gem of Plenty&quot; because of the fertility of the valley. During the mining era the valley was known as the &quot;garden&quot; for the mining regions.
While campaigning for a return to Congress in 1934, Robert M. McCracken died in an automobile accident near Emmett. His vehicle went through a guard rail and tumbled down Freezeout Hill.

Until 2001, the city was home to a Boise Cascade manufacturing facility. The Black Canyon diversion dam on the Payette River, built in the early 1920s, is east of the city.

Rising some above sea level, Squaw Butte, named by [Confederate Settlers new to the area]; Native Americans who used this area as their winter resort, stands at the north end of the valley. The Payette River was named after Francois Payette, a fur trader from Quebec who was put in charge of old Fort Boise in 1818 and traveled through the area. Permanent settlement began in the early 1860s, after gold discoveries in the Boise Basin brought people over the established stage and pack train routes. Two of these trails joined at the Payette River north of the present river bridge in Emmett.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. It is located south of the Payette River, at an elevation of above sea level.

<text>Ferdinand is a city in Idaho County, Idaho, United States. The population was 159 at the 2010 census, up from 145 in 2000. At the southern end of the Nez Perce Indian Reservation, it was founded by F.M. Bieker shortly after the reservation was opened for settlement in 1895. It was named after Ferdinand, Indiana, where his mother&#x27;s family had lived.

==Geography==
Ferdinand is located on the Camas Prairie.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

==Transportation==

===Highway===
* - US 95 - to Craigmont (north) and Cottonwood (south)
Northbound U.S. Route 95 was formerly routed westward through town as Main Street, first passing underneath the railroad tracks. Exiting town, old US-95 then resumed northward, following a descending tributary into Lawyers Creek Canyon. Two miles (3 km) north of Ferdinand, the old highway passed underneath a timber railroad trestle, Bridge #40, high, (photos) of the Camas Prairie Railroad, then descended into the canyon to cross the creek into Lewis County. Before climbing a tributary up to Craigmont, the highway briefly paralleled a steel railroad trestle (Bridge #38) near its base, its track above the creek.

After years of planning, the highway was re-routed in 1993; the straighter US-95 now bypasses Ferdinand on its east side and stays east of the railroad and above the canyon. It crosses Lawyers Creek on a bridge (photo) which opened in October 1991 and passes over the site of the previous bridge, built in 1948.

===Railroad===
The second subdivision of the Camas Prairie Railroad arrived in Ferdinand in 1909, branching off the main line at Spalding and ending at Grangeville. The line on the Camas Prairie has gone under several ownership changes since 1998; it is now operated by BG&amp;CM Railroad and terminates in Cottonwood. Passenger service on the line ended in 1955.

<text>Kamiah ( ) is a city in Lewis and Idaho counties in the U.S. state of Idaho. The largest city in Lewis County, it extends only a small distance into Idaho County, south of Lawyer Creek. The population was 1,295 at the 2010 census, up from 1,160 in 2000. The city lies in the narrow valley of the Clearwater River; downstream are Orofino and Lewiston, at the confluence with the Snake River.

==History==
The Kamiah area has been inhabited by the Nez Perce for centuries. The name &quot;Kamiah&quot; is Nez Perce for &quot;many rope litters,&quot; as Nez Perce manufactured &quot;Kamia&quot; ropes in the area to fish steelhead. Also according to Nez Perce tradition, the Appaloosa horse was first bred in the area.

On their return trip east, the Lewis and Clark Expedition camped in the Kamiah area for several weeks during the spring of 1806, waiting for snows to melt.

Kamiah is the character name of the Nez Perce/Blackfoot woman in &quot;Across the Wide Missouri&quot;, a 1951 &#x27;mountain men&#x27; film set in the 1830s. Similar in fame to Sacagawea of the Lewis &amp; Clark expedition, Kamiah led her associated mountain men&#x27;s troop over the Bitterroot Range to her homeland (Three Forks, Montana for Sacagawea).

Hohots Ilppilp was the leader around Kamiah from at least the time of Lewis and Clark until the 1840s. When the first leader for all the Nez Perce was appointed, it was Hohots Ilppilp&#x27;s grandson Ellis who lived in this area and maintained large herds of sheep, cattle and over a thousand horses.

Kamiah is within the Nez Perce Indian Reservation. Similar to the opening of lands in Oklahoma, the U.S. government opened the reservation for white settlement in November 1895. The proclamation had been signed less than two weeks earlier by President Cleveland.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The city is located at the confluence of Lawyer Creek and the Clearwater River on the left bank of the latter. In the Kamiah area, the Lewis-Idaho County line follows Lawyer Creek to its confluence with the Clearwater, and then turns to follow the Clearwater. U.S. Route 12 passes through Kamiah, crossing from the right to left bank of the Clearwater at the city. The two streams cut deep and narrow valleys through the otherwise relatively flat, rolling Camas Prairie region that surrounds Kamiah. The city is located at 1,250 feet above sea level, but elevations of over 2,800 feet on the prairie lie within three miles of Kamiah.

In addition to U.S. Route 12, transportation links to Kamiah are provided by Idaho State Highway 64 and Idaho State Highway 162.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Kamiah has a hot-summer continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;).

<doc id="110704" wikidata="Q1513739" url="?curid=110704" title="Kooskia, Idaho">
<text>Kooskia ( ) is a city in Idaho County, Idaho, United States. It is at the confluence of the South and Middle forks of the Clearwater River, combining to become the main river. The population was 607 at the 2010 census, down from 675 in 2000.

==History==
Chief Looking Glass lived in a village a short distance above what is now Kooskia with his band of Nez Perce. This regular home was well within the boundaries of the reservation created in 1863, but just before the Nez Perce War an American General was sent to arrest Chief Looking Glass and all other Nez Perce with him. When trigger-happy militiamen opened fire into the village, many Nez Perce died and their village was destroyed in the scuffle. Because of this incident, Looking Glass joined with the Nez Perce for the Nez Perce War.

The name of the town is likely a contraction of the Nez Perce word &quot;koos-koos-kia,&quot; a diminutive which refers to the Clearwater River, the lesser of the two large rivers in the vicinity, the other being the Snake. The town was first named Stuart, after James Stuart (1863–1929), a Nez Perce surveyor and merchant. The railroad arrived in 1899 and named its station &quot;Kooskia,&quot; because there already was a railroad station named &quot;Stuart&quot; in the state. The town went by both names for the next decade until it was formally renamed in 1909.

Kooskia is within the Nez Perce Indian Reservation. Similar to the opening of lands in Oklahoma several years earlier, the U.S. government opened the reservation for white settlement in November 1895. The proclamation had been signed less than two weeks earlier by President Cleveland.

===Tramway===
Starting in 1903, Kooskia was the terminus of an aerial tramway from the elevated Camas Prairie. It carried up to of grain per day in its thirty buckets and warehouse facilities were present at both ends of the cable line, with a combined capacity of .

Following the completion of the Camas Prairie Railroad&#x27;s second subdivision to Grangeville in 1909, the tramway gradually lost patronage and was discontinued in 1939. It climbed west-southwest toward Lowe (later Winona); some older maps listed Kooskia as &quot;Tramway.&quot; It experienced a significant accident in 1907 due to cable failure, fortunately without fatalities.

===Kooskia Internment Camp===

During the final two years of World War II, the Kooskia Internment Camp was located about northeast of the town. Originally a remote highway work camp of the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s, it was later run by the Federal Bureau of Prisons and then converted in 1943 to house interned Japanese men, most of whom were longtime U.S. residents, but not citizens, branded &quot;enemy aliens.&quot; It was so remote in the western Bitterroot Mountains that fences and guard towers were unnecessary. The site, now an archaeological project, is northeast of Lowell on U.S. 12, on the north bank of the Lochsa River.

===Kooskia National Fish Hatchery===
The Kooskia National Fish Hatchery was established in the 1960s, about southeast of the city on the east bank of Clear Creek. ()

It climbed the main river eastward from Lewiston to Kooskia and then turned south to ascend the lower South Fork. The abandoned spur was removed in the 1980s, and the city incorporated in early 1905.

The original highway bridge (1911) that crossed the Salmon River just north of Riggins was replaced in 1936 and moved north to Stites.

<text>White Bird is a city in Idaho County, Idaho. The population was 91 at the time of the 2010 census, down from 106 in 2000.

==History==
At the southwest corner of the Camas Prairie, White Bird is near the Salmon River crossing point for the Lewis and Clark expedition. It is also the location of the Battle of White Bird Canyon in 1877, which was the first fight of the Nez Perce War and a significant defeat of the U.S. Army.

The summit of White Bird Hill is above the city, ascended via U.S. Highway 95. The steeper, straighter and faster multi-lane grade of U.S. 95 was opened in 1975, after ten challenging years of construction. The two-lane road of 1921 to the east was first paved in 1938; it left the Salmon River at White Bird Creek, followed it up through White Bird and then gradually climbed the grade in twice the distance, with multiple switchback curves to a higher summit, without a cut.

White Bird was established in 1891 and was named for Chief White Bird, a Nez Perce leader.

<text>Athol ( ; is a city in Kootenai County, Idaho, United States. The population was 709 at the 2020 census, up from 692 in the 2010 census. It is part of the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes the entire county. Its main attraction is Silverwood Theme Park.

==Description==
Athol contains the Silverwood Theme Park. Several miles east of the city is the historic Farragut State Park, located at the southern end of Lake Pend Oreille. In March 2022, Dollar General opened its first storefront in the state of Idaho in Athol.

==History==

A post office called the Athol Post Office has been in operation since 1895. The city may be named after the Duke of Atholl.

The City of Athol website details a brief history as follows: 

Until the early 1800s when explorers/trappers began coming into the area, Native American tribes, primarily of the Coeur d’Alene and Spokane Tribes, had exclusive use of the land as they migrated through the region en route to their encampments near the area&#x27;s many lakes and streams.

All this changed when the Northern Pacific Railroad station was built in Athol in 1882, and settlers hoped for a vast agricultural paradise. The depot was established in Athol on its line between Hauser Junction and Sandpoint. In 1895, town residents consisting of mostly railroad employees and homesteaders successfully petitioned postal authorities for a post office.

The white pine forest first attracted early settlers to Athol, and logging, milling, and agriculture created prosperity. However, the location of the new community was on state lands. In 1903, lots in Athol were auctioned by the state. State surveyors platted the new township but, apparently, did not record the change in ownership. For many years, the town&#x27;s residents did not have title to their land. Eventually the state corrected the problem.

Athol was first known as Colton, the town was renamed Athol by a settler who came from Athol, Massachusetts. The Massachusetts Athol was named after a town in Scotland named for the Duke of Atholl. No one knows for sure if Athol, Idaho was named by a descendent of the same family or if the name was just brought west during the 19th century.

In 1900, the Methodist congregation built a church that also served as a school until 1902, when school patrons built their first school building. In December 1902 Hackett &amp; Wilson opened a sawmill near the city. The mill became the city&#x27;s largest employer and had the capacity of producing 25,000 board feet of lumber per day. By 1903, there were many businesses opened, including the Pacific Hotel, a drugstore, a smithy, a jewelry store, restaurants, a mercantile company, and a saloon.

Athol&#x27;s first water well was dug by hand by Joe Pricsha and his crew. It was over 350 feet deep. They dug into a large boulder, so they had to dig around it, which made a curve in the shaft. A 5hp pump motor was installed, which supplied the town with water. Later, another shaft with a larger pump was installed in the same hand-dug hole.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it being land.

==Demographics==
As of 2000 the median income for a household in the city was $30,595, and the median income for a family was $31,875. Males had a median income of $28,438 versus $17,813 for females. The per capita income for the city was $13,632. About 11.0% of families and 14.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 10.3% of those under age 18 and 23.7% of those age 65 or over.

===2010 census===
As of the census of 2010, there were 692 people, 282 households, and 176 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 305 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 97.0% White, 0.9% Native American, and 2.2% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.3% of the population.

<text>Coeur d&#x27;Alene ( ; ) is a city and the county seat of Kootenai County, Idaho, United States. It is the most populous city in North Idaho and the principal city of the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 54,628 at the 2020 census. Coeur d&#x27;Alene is a satellite city of Spokane, which is located about to the west in the state of Washington. The two cities are the key components of the Spokane–Coeur d&#x27;Alene Combined Statistical Area, of which Coeur d&#x27;Alene is the third-largest city (after Spokane and its largest suburb, Spokane Valley). The city is situated on the north shore of the long Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene and to the west of the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Mountains. Locally, Coeur d&#x27;Alene is known as the &quot;Lake City&quot;, or simply called by its initials, &quot;CDA&quot;.

The city is named after the Coeur d&#x27;Alene people, a federally recognized tribe of Native Americans who live along the rivers and lakes of the region, in a territory of from eastern Washington to Montana. The native peoples were hunter-gatherers who located their villages and camps near food gathering or processing sites and followed the seasonal cycles, practicing subsistence hunting, fishing, and foraging.

The city began as a fort town; General William Tecumseh Sherman sited what became known as Fort Sherman on the north shore of Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene in 1878. Peopling of the town came when miners and prospectors came to the region after gold and silver deposits were found in what would become the Silver Valley and after the Northern Pacific Railroad reached the town in 1883. In the 1890s, two significant miners&#x27; uprisings over wages took place in the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Mining District leading to the declaration of martial law, with the latter providing a motive for the assassination of a former Idaho governor and subsequently a nationally publicized trial. The late 19th century discovery of highly prized white pine in the forests of northern Idaho resulted in a timber boom that peaked in the late 1920s and was accompanied by the rapid population growth which led to the incorporation of the city on September 4, 1906. After the Great Depression, tourism started to become a major source of development in the area. By the 1980s, tourism became the major driver in the local economy, and, after decades of heavy reliance on logging, the city featured a more balanced economy with manufacturing, retail, and service sectors.

The city of Coeur d&#x27;Alene has grown significantly since the 1990s, in part because of a substantial increase in tourism, encouraged by resorts and recreational activities in the area and outmigration predominantly from other western states. The Coeur d&#x27;Alene Resort and its floating boardwalk and a natural area called Tubbs Hill take up a prominent portion of the city&#x27;s downtown. Popular parks such as City Park and Beach and McEuen Park are also fixtures of the downtown waterfront. The city has become somewhat of a destination for golfers; there are five courses in the city, including the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Resort Golf Course and its unique 14th hole floating green. The Coeur d&#x27;Alene Casino and its Circling Raven Golf Club is located approximately south and the largest theme park in the Northwestern United States, Silverwood Theme Park, is located approximately north. There are also several ski resorts and other recreation areas nearby. The city is home to the Museum of North Idaho and North Idaho College, and it has become known for having one of the largest holiday light shows in the United States and hosting a popular Ironman Triathlon event. Coeur d&#x27;Alene is located on the route of Interstate 90 and is served by the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Airport as well as the Brooks Seaplane Base by air. In print media, local issues are covered by the &quot;Coeur d&#x27;Alene Press&quot; daily newspaper.

==History==
The Coeur d&#x27;Alene people called themselves &quot;Schitsu&#x27;umsh&quot; in Coeur d&#x27;Alene, one of the Salishan languages, meaning &quot;those who are found here&quot; or &quot;the found ones&quot;. These Native Americans lived along the rivers and lakes of the region, in a territory of extending from eastern Washington to Montana; these tribes primarily located their villages and camps near food gathering or processing sites. The camps featured conical lodges constructed from poles and mats sewn from tule or animal hides. The Coeur d&#x27;Alene people were hunter-gatherers who practiced subsistence hunting of wild game and fishing during the salmon runs, and then foraging for berries and other edibles along the shores of the region&#x27;s numerous lakes and rivers. The introduction of the horse c. 1760 made hunting and transportation more efficient.

===1800s===
The area was extensively explored by fur trader David Thompson of the North West Company starting in 1807 and in 1809 he established the Kullyspell House trading post on Lake Pend Oreille. Thompson, who usually used native names to describe the places and people he came across, ascribed the name of &#x27;Pointed Hearts&#x27; to one of the tribes he traded with and &quot;Pointed Heart Lake&quot; for the lake they lived near. Since Thompson traveled with French-speaking Iroquois guides and scouts, it has been speculated that they may have been the first to refer to the tribe as the Coeur d&#x27;Alene. As French was the spoken language of the Canadian fur traders, it is likely that &quot;pointed heart&quot; has its origins in the French transliteration of &quot;Cœur&quot; or &quot;heart&quot;, &quot;d″&quot; or &quot;in the middle of&quot; and &quot;Alêne&quot; or &quot;awl&quot;, meaning the tribal traders had hearts as sharp as the tip of an awl – or that they were sharp businessmen.

The Oregon boundary dispute (or Oregon question) arose as a result of competing British and American claims to the Pacific Northwest of North America in the first half of the 19th century. The British had trading ties extending from Canada and had started settlements at Fort Vancouver and at Fort Astoria on the Pacific coast near the mouth of the Columbia River. The Oregon Treaty of 1846 ended the disputed joint occupation of the area in present-day Idaho when Britain ceded all rights to land south of the 49th parallel to the United States.

In another territorial dispute, the U.S. government through Washington Territory Governor Isaac Stevens began to negotiate treaties that would begin to move the various tribes of the region onto reservation lands to make way for American settlement. This angered the Coeur d&#x27;Alene, as several treaty re-negotiations continually reduced their tribal lands. The tribe also perceived the planned construction a military wagon road as a precursor to a land-grab by the United States. These talks and increasing settler encroachment sparked armed hostilities between the native Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Spokane and Palouse and the settler populations that resulted in an initial victory for the tribes at the Battle of Steptoe Butte but were followed up with George Wright&#x27;s campaign that subdued the natives. The Coeur d&#x27;Alene Reservation is located in Benewah and Kootenai counties south of Coeur d&#x27;Alene in communities focused around Worley and Plummer. In 1859, with U.S. funding in place, Governor Stevens appointed John Mullan to survey the interior of the Northwestern United States for possible railroad routes and oversee the construction of the Mullan Road that bears his name, from Fort Walla Walla on the Columbia River through the Rocky Mountains to Fort Benton on the Missouri River.

With the discovery of gold in the western United States and the establishment of Idaho Territory in 1863, there was an increase in settlers to the region. When General William Tecumseh Sherman was commander of the U.S. Army during the Indian Wars and following the defeat of General George Armstrong Custer at the Battle of Little Big Horn, he erected several forts in the west. During a tour of the Inland Northwest on his way to Fort Walla Walla on the Mullan Road, he was impressed by the scenery of the area and ordered a fort constructed on the lake in 1877 and gave it the name Fort Coeur d&#x27;Alene. The fort which gave the city its name was established in 1878 and the name of the fort was later changed to Fort Sherman to honor the general.

Miners and prospectors came to the region after gold and silver deposits were found in the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Mountains and the Northern Pacific Railroad came to the village in 1883. The village became the location where ore from the mining district was ferried and transferred to the rail lines from steamboats that traveled down from the Coeur d&#x27;Alene River from the Cataldo Mission. The township was officially incorporated by petition on August 22, 1887.

In the 1890s, two significant miners&#x27; uprisings took place in the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Mining District, where the workers struggled with high risk and low pay. In 1892, the union&#x27;s discovery of a labor spy in their midst, in the person of Charlie Siringo, a sometime cowboy and Pinkerton agent, resulted in a labor strike that developed into a shooting war between miners and the company in Burke Canyon. When the mine owners planned to reduce wages of some workers to offset increased operating costs, the miners declared a strike against the reduction of wages and the increase in work hours and demanded a &quot;living wage&quot; be paid to every man working underground – the common laborer as well as the skilled in a stand for industrial unionism. To restore order to the state of rebellion in Shoshone County, Governor N. B. Willey declared martial law and sent federal troops to arrest and detain the union miners, but not before dozens of casualties including six deaths and the destruction of the Frisco Mill. Six hundred miners were put into &quot;bullpens&quot; without any hearings or formal charges.

Labor disputes between some company mines and the union continued into the next decade. A similar labor confrontation in 1899 took place after the union was launching an organizing drive of the few mines not yet fully unionized, where miners working in the Bunker Hill and Sullivan mines were receiving fifty cents to a dollar less per day than other miners. With no success in the effort, on April 29, 250 union members seized a train in Burke at gunpoint, according to the engineer, Levi &quot;Al&quot; Hutton. At each stop through Burke Canyon, more miners climbed aboard what was dubbed the &quot;Dynamite Express&quot; toward the site of the $250,000 Bunker Hill mine near Wardner; the miners then carried 3,000 pounds (1,400 kg) of dynamite into the mill and completely destroyed it. The crowd also burned down the company office, the boarding house, and the home of the mine manager. Like in the 1892 strike, martial law was declared by Governor Frank Steunenberg and wholesale arrests and mass incarcerations were done to bring back order. Harry Orchard, who owned a share of the Hercules Mine at one point and played a significant role in the Colorado Labor Wars, returned to Idaho to assassinate former governor Steunenberg in 1905. The bombing assassination led to a nationally publicized trial in Boise.

After a U.S. Geological Survey done in the 1890s, it became widely known that there were large quantities of white pine, a highly prized softwood, in the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Mountains. The lumber industry from the eastern US began to inventory the timberlands, acquire land, and invest in facilities across much of northern Idaho. This was welcome relief to the town of Coeur d&#x27;Alene, which had been reeling from the Panic of 1893, a flood in 1894, and the closure of Fort Sherman.

===1900s===
The city experienced significant growth from the timber boom and the development of the railroads, steamboats, and tourism that accompanied it; Coeur d&#x27;Alene incorporated as a city on September 4, 1906, and by 1908 it had become the county seat. From 1900 to 1915, there were hundreds of homes constructed across 70 newly platted additions. With the advent of the automobile and the internal combustion engine, trucks and chainsaws, the felling and transporting of trees became more productive and efficient and lumber production reached its height in the late 1910s and 1920s; in 1925 there were seven lumber mills operating in the area and they were producing 500 million board feet of lumber.

After the 1929 stock market crash and during the Great Depression, the lumber industry demand began to wane and by the mid-1930s about half the woodworkers in North Idaho were laid off and the surviving mills were producing only 160 million board feet of lumber per year. Although it was a tough time, accomplishments during the Depression years included the establishment of Coeur d&#x27;Alene Junior College (North Idaho College) in 1933, the construction of Northwest Boulevard through the Works Progress Administration program in 1937, and the building of the popular Playfair Pier amusement park on the lake in the early 1940s. The Playfair Pier opened on July 4, 1942 (and existed until 1974) in City Park and included a variety of rides and attractions such as a miniature roller coaster, a Ferris wheel, a carousel, and some of the usual carnival games. Coeur d&#x27;Alene benefited from its proximity to the Farragut Naval Training Station, established in 1942 on the south end of Lake Pend Oreille, which employed 22,000 people and needed 98 million board feet of lumber to build 650 buildings.

Due to the scenic lake, tourism has always been a factor in the local economy. In the early 1900s, it had become popular in Spokane to travel and picnic in the park, shop in town, and take steamboat cruises on the lake and up the Saint Joe River. Coeur d&#x27;Alene had also received national publicity in magazines, where it had been called a &quot;wonderland&quot; and &quot;the Lucerne of America&quot;. However, tourism began to become a mainstay of the economy with the completion of highway infrastructure projects in the 1950s and 1960s, and the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Chamber of Commerce began to promote the city as a tourist destination as well. As tourism increased, there was more demand for lodging facilities, convention space, restaurants, and cultural activities. By 1976, the city had over 30 motels with about 1,500 rooms. On June 14, 1958, the city hosted the first Diamond Cup Hydroplane race, which was one of the largest events in its history and garnered national publicity and media coverage. The event was attended by 30,000 people, and it was considered a success by the Diamond Cup organizers. The race was held at Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene for the next eight years; it was discontinued due to persistent difficulties in raising funds for the event.

After decades of heavy reliance on logging, in the 1980s, the city featured a more balanced economy with manufacturing, retail, and service sectors. Tourism has taken on even more prominence and has become one of the main drivers of the local economy since the start of the 1980s, when there was new investment into recreational tourism in the area. In 1982, a $2 million Wild Waters aquatic theme park was built, and in the spring of 1986 there was the opening of the $60 million ($ in dollars), 18-story Coeur d&#x27;alene Resort. The waterfront resort featured a well-manicured frontage and a publicly accessible floating boardwalk that gave visitors the impression of a park-like environment and attracted the attention of publications nationwide. The actions of the Aryan Nations, a white supremacist group founded by Richard Butler in 1974, also attracted media attention. Butler&#x27;s acolytes, many of whom were transplants like him, were linked to several robberies, murders, and three bombings, including the bombing of a &quot;Spokesman-Review&quot; office. In 1986, Coeur d&#x27;Alene was presented the Raoul Wallenberg Award for its stand in peacefully countering the message of the white supremacists that moved into the area. Coeur d&#x27;Alene also won the All-America City Award in 1990. The Aryan Nations went bankrupt and ceased operations in 2000 when the Southern Poverty Law Center filed a lawsuit after the assault of a Native American woman. The lawsuit resulted in a $6.3 million judgment and the closure of their Hayden compound.
In the 1990s, the Coeur d&#x27;Alene area starting experiencing substantial population growth; many of these initial transplants came from California, citing earthquakes, crime, and overcrowding as reasons for their move. This northward migration coincided with watershed events such as the 1992 Los Angeles riots and the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The surrounding area got increased tourist attention when Silverwood Theme Park, which opened in 1988 on an airstrip with an authentic steam train and carnival rides, installed the Corkscrew roller coaster in 1990 that it purchased from Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm. Additional rides such as the Timber Terror and Tremors roller coasters in the 1990s and the Boulder Beach water park in 2003 made Silverwood into a regional theme park, which attracts visitors primarily from the Spokane, Tri-Cities, and Seattle areas of Washington as well as some from the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta.

===2000s===
In 2014, McEuen Park on the downtown waterfront reopened to the public after undergoing a major $20 million renovation that transformed it from a park with baseball diamonds into a multi-use park with a variety of athletic facilities, a playground, and a dog park. The state of Idaho is the fastest-growing state in the country and according to Census Bureau data in 2018, the city and county were among the fastest growing metropolitan areas in the nation with a net migration of about 3,200 residents from 2015 to 2016. The newest transplants are still mainly from other western states and are moving for economic as well as political reasons, seeking a lower cost of living, more affordable housing, an outdoor lifestyle, and a place that is more conservative.

==Geography==
===Topography===
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Coeur d&#x27;Alene is east of downtown Spokane, Washington, and east of Seattle. The city is part of the Spokane–Coeur d&#x27;Alene combined statistical area and the Inland Northwest region, consisting of eastern Washington, northern Idaho, northwestern Montana, and northeastern Oregon.

The city is located on the north shore of Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene, near the outlet of the Spokane River, and is in the Northern Rockies ecoregion. Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene is a natural dam-controlled lake that is long and to wide and fed by the Coeur d&#x27;Alene and Saint Joe rivers. Although the Post Falls Dam on the Spokane River near Post Falls controls the lake levels, the lake is usually kept at natural levels from January to June. To the immediate southeast is Fernan Lake and to the northeast of the city is Hayden Lake and even further northeast in northern Kootenai County is Lake Pend Oreille, which is among the largest and deepest natural lakes in the western United States with a surface area of and maximum depth of . These lakes, like others in the Spokane Valley and Rathdrum Prairie, were formed by the Missoula Floods, which ended 12,000 to 15,000 years ago. The Coeur d&#x27;Alene Mountains of the Bitterroot Range rise to the east of the city to a maximum elevation of at Cherry Peak.

The wooded lands east of the city, the Coeur d&#x27;Alene National Forest, have been designated for protection and management by the Idaho Panhandle National Forests. These thick forests include groves of ancient western redcedar and host over 300 wildlife species including woodland caribou, Canada lynx, grizzly bear, and wolves. The large lakes in the Idaho panhandle attract birds on the Pacific Flyway, and bird watching is popular on Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene, especially from November to February when bald eagles come annually to feed on the spawning kokanee. The Cougar Bay Nature Preserve on the northeast portion of Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene is the closest and most accessible nature preserve for wildlife viewing, as it is located a few minutes from downtown Coeur d&#x27;Alene.

Environmental concerns have come as a result of upstream hardrock mining and smelting operations in the Silver Valley. The Coeur d&#x27;Alene Basin, including Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene, is polluted with heavy metals such as lead and was designated a superfund site in 1983 that spans and of the Coeur d&#x27;Alene River. The majority of the lake bed is covered in a layer of contaminated sediment and local health officials at the Panhandle Health District advise the lake&#x27;s visitors to wash anything that has come into contact with potentially lead-laced soil or dust in the Coeur d&#x27;Alene River basin.
====Landscape====
===Climate===

Coeur d&#x27;Alene has, depending on the definition, a dry-summer continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dsb&quot;) or a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;), characterized by a cold, moist climate in winter, and very warm, dry conditions in summer. The daily mean temperature ranges from in January and December to in July. Temperatures exceed on 18.3 days per year, only occasionally reaching , and there may be several nights below . The average first and last freezes of the season are October 17 and April 28, respectively. The city straddles the border between USDA Plant Hardiness Zones 6B and 7A. The Spokane–Coeur d&#x27;Alene area has many microclimates that can have different weather patterns and observations from the nearby official reporting stations used by the National Weather Service due to the diversity of the topography and other factors. For instance, northern Idaho experiences more precipitation in rain and snow than eastern Washington from weather systems originating from the Pacific Ocean because it is on the windward side of the Rocky Mountains. Average annual rainfall is and the average annual snowfall is . Northern Idaho weather is influenced by both maritime and continental weather systems. Moist air masses from the coast are released as precipitation over the North Central Rockies forests, creating the North American inland temperate rainforest, and dry air masses from Canada and the Great Plains contribute to dry summer months. Coeur d&#x27;Alene can have noticeably milder nights and cooler days due to the moderating effect on the climate of large bodies of water such as Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene.

===Cityscape===
====Neighborhoods====

As Coeur d&#x27;Alene has grown from a fort town, different neighborhoods and suburbs have grown around it. The downtown city center of Coeur d&#x27;Alene is in the southeast of the urban area as the presence of Hayden Lake and Lake Fernan and the Coeur d&#x27;Alene mountains inhibit development to the east and Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene and the Spokane River limit development to the south and southwest. Historic additions from the early 1900s were added close to the city center a few blocks from downtown, such as on East Sherman Avenue, East Lakeshore Drive near Sanders Beach, and near present-day City Park. Today, the city has many neighborhoods, the largest being Coeur d&#x27;Alene city center, Post Falls and Hayden. The Coeur d&#x27;Alene city center has several parks and attractions and as a community gathering place, it has heavy foot traffic on fair weather summer weekends.

The largest building in the city, the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Resort Lake Tower, is in the city center. The downtown area is of increasing interest to higher density multifamily apartment and condominium-type developments to cope with the growth in housing demand and due to a lack of space and concerns about urban sprawl.

Investment in residential and retail development has been intensive along the Interstate 90 corridor and has made Post Falls near the Washington state line become Kootenai County&#x27;s second largest city. Due to its central location between Spokane and Coeur d&#x27;Alene, the city is host to a growing list of retail stores and is considered a bedroom community of Spokane.

The historic Post Falls Dam and surrounding Falls Park on the Spokane River is a local landmark. Hayden is the third largest city in the Coeur d&#x27;Alene metropolitan area, and it is known for the eponymous Hayden Lake that was once the historic center of the community. The shores of the lake are filled with summer cabins and large mansions. The historic Hayden Lake Country Club, which lies at the center of the Hayden Lake community, was built in 1907 along with a rail connection with the Spokane and Inland Empire Railroad that same year, which brought in many tourists to the resort and Honeysuckle Beach.

With the rising use of the automobile, the center of town shifted away from the lake and railroad and reoriented toward Government Way.

==Demographics==
===2020 U.S. Decennial Census===
As of the census of 2020, there were 54,628 people and 22,699 households residing in the city. Coeur d&#x27;Alene and its Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which consists of Kootenai County, have been combined by the Census Bureau into the Spokane–Coeur d&#x27;Alene Combined Statistical Area (CSA) where it is the third-largest polity after Spokane and its largest suburb, Spokane Valley. The population of the CSA was 745,213 in 2020. The principal cities in the CSA are separated by suburbs that largely follow the path of Spokane Valley and Rathdrum Prairie. The City of Coeur d&#x27;Alene has opted not to voluntarily merge with the Spokane MSA and to remain a distinct metropolitan area. According to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines, the two MSAs will automatically be combined by the OMB when the employment interchange exceeds 25 percent; in 2011, 18 percent of residents commuted between Spokane and Kootenai counties for work.

Idaho is part of a region called the Unchurched Belt, a region in the Northwestern United States that has historically low rates of religious participation. The evangelical Christian community has been growing with the overall population and there have been instances of whole congregations moving to the area from out of state. The evangelical Christian Real Life Ministries church located in Post Falls was the 13th fastest growing church in the nation in 2007.

Many new residents are retirees seeking lower cost of living and traffic; the number of residents aged 65 years and older doubled from 2001 to 2019 according to the Idaho Department of Labor.

According to the National Incident-Based Reporting System, the Coeur d&#x27;Alene metro area (Kootenai County) crime rate per 100,000 population was 4,864 in 2018, which was lower than the Idaho state average of 5,032. The county has a property crime rate of 12.88 and a violent crime rate of 1.59 per 1,000 people in the 2018 Uniform Crime Reports summary, which is lower than the Idaho state average of 14.61 and 2.27 respectively. According to NeighborhoodScout&#x27;s methodology, the city has a crime index of 24, meaning it is safer than 24 percent of US cities, and has a property and violent crime rate slightly above the Idaho state average but still below the national median in both categories.

==Economy==
Historically, the economy of Coeur d&#x27;Alene was built and based on mining and logging and the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Mining District has been one of the world&#x27;s most productive mining districts. However, after mining and logging diminished in importance in the 1940s, tourism has come to be the main influence in the local economy ever since. The city has become a major tourist attraction, being at the heart of north Idaho&#x27;s Lake Country where people partake in water sports and activities such as wake boarding, paddleboarding, sailing, parasailing, jet skiing, kayaking, fishing and other lake recreation. In addition to the natural attractions and parks, the Coeur d&#x27;Alene area has two major resorts on the lake, the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Resort and the WorldMark Arrow Point resort directly across the lake in Harrison near the community of Eddyville as well as the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Casino in Worley, and the Northwestern United States&#x27; largest theme park in the Silverwood Theme Park in Athol. There are three major ski resorts within a short driving distance, Silver Mountain Resort in Kellogg, Lookout Pass Ski and Recreation Area at Lookout Pass near Mullan, and Schweitzer Mountain Ski Resort in Sandpoint. Tourism and hospitality related jobs employed over 10,000 people in north Idaho in 2010.

Coeur d&#x27;Alene is the healthcare, educational, media, manufacturing, retail and recreation center for north Idaho. Coeur d&#x27;Alene&#x27;s retail has expanded greatly in recent years with the opening of new stores and entertainment venues; the Silver Lake Mall, which is the largest in North Idaho, was opened in 1989. Coeur d&#x27;Alene&#x27;s Village at Riverstone development along Northwest Boulevard houses a park, amphitheater, 14-theater Regal Cinemas, a Hampton Inn, condominiums, restaurants, and local retailers.

Companies that have their head offices in Coeur d&#x27;Alene include mining company and owner of the Lucky Friday mine in Mullan, Hecla Mining and the U.S. operations of Canada-based restaurant Pita Pit. A knife manufacturer, Buck Knives, is the most recognizable brand name in the area, where they relocated the head office and factory from San Diego to the Coeur d&#x27;Alene suburb of Post Falls in 2005. Construction company and roller coaster manufacturer, Rocky Mountain Construction is based in Hayden. In 2017, the Coeur d&#x27;Alene metropolitan area had a gross metropolitan product of $5.93 billion. The Coeur d&#x27;Alene metropolitan area has a workforce of 80,000 people and an unemployment rate of 6.8% (as of June 2020); the largest sectors for non-farm employment are trade, transportation, and utilities, government, and education and health services as well as leisure and hospitality.

The average commute to work is 18.5 minutes. Commuting across the state line into Washington is not uncommon. A concern for the city is that the rising minimum wage and salary differential between Washington and Idaho will cause local personnel shortages. In 2011, the Idaho state median hourly wage was $14.51 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

==Arts and culture==
===Racism===
The Aryan Nations established their headquarters near Coeur d&#x27;Alene in the 1980s, and members of the group were frequently seen in the city. A successor group, Jerald O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Aryan Nations, is still based in the city. Today, the city is a target of American Redoubt-related immigration.

In June 2020, during George Floyd protests, armed civilians patrolled the streets of downtown Coeur d&#x27;Alene, citing a desire to protect businesses from potential looting. No violent incidents occurred.

In June 2022, 31 members of Patriot Front, including leader Thomas Rousseau, were arrested after appearing at the city&#x27;s Pride parade. The group maintains an active presence in Coeur d&#x27;Alene.

In March 2024, during the 2024 NCAA Women&#x27;s Basketball tournament, local residents shouted racial slurs at players of the University of Utah Women&#x27;s Basketball team.

===Arts and theater===
The Coeur d&#x27;Alene area has a growing arts scene. The community has a symphony and theater productions from professional and community groups. The city has several art galleries, almost all displaying art located in the walkable downtown area along Sherman Avenue, Coeur d&#x27;Alene&#x27;s main street. Among the most prominent of these galleries is The Art Spirit Gallery. Art can also be seen outside for free. Since 1999, the City of Coeur d&#x27;Alene has had a funding mechanism for public art where 1.33 percent of the total cost of all eligible above-ground capital improvement projects is earmarked to fund art in public places.

In the musical arts, the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Symphony traces its roots to the late 1970s as a class at North Idaho College. The symphony performs an annual free concert for the community on Labor Day in Coeur d&#x27;Alene City Park and also performs during the summer. Street artists and musicians frequent Sherman Square performing for pedestrians. Theater arts are provided by the professional Coeur d&#x27;Alene Summer Theatre group and the community theater company, Lake City Playhouse. The city&#x27;s primary performing arts venues are the Schuler Performing Arts Center within Boswell Hall at North Idaho College and the Kroc Center.

===Museums===

The Museum of North Idaho located in downtown Coeur d&#x27;Alene chronicles the history of the region. The museum was established in July 1973 and permanent exhibits include &quot;Schitsu&#x27;umsh, &#x27;The People Who Were Discovered Here&#x27;&quot;, which explores the lives of the Coeur d&#x27;Alene people; &quot;The Mullan Road&quot;, which commemorates Idaho&#x27;s first road through the Fourth of July Pass; &quot;The Scandinavians Settled Here&quot;, which examines the Nordic influences on Coeur d&#x27;Alene; and &quot;Steamboats&quot;, which displays artifacts and photographs of the steamboats that used to cruise the lake. The museum does walking tours of the Fort Sherman grounds and also rents out the Fort Sherman chapel, the oldest building in the city as a wedding venue.

===Events and activities===
Many of the community events and activities in Coeur d&#x27;Alene occur during the warm summer months and they often take place by the lake. Annual events include the Fourth of July Festival and the Holiday Light Show that begins at the end of November. Coeur d&#x27;Alene has been known for hosting big Fourth of July celebrations since its early days as a fort town. The Fourth of July Festival usually includes a parade down Sherman Avenue, food and craft vendors, carnival rides, and live music and entertainment. Many watch the fireworks by the waterfront and beach; the Coeur d&#x27;Alene resort offers fireworks cruises that depart from Independence Point. In the winter, the Holiday Light Show festivities begin at the end of November and the lights are on display until January 1. The event also begins with a parade down Sherman Avenue and ends with a fireworks show; the resort&#x27;s light show features over 1.5 million bulbs, and the resort offers &quot;Journey to the North Pole&quot; cruises. Another event in the winter months that often gets media attention is the Polar Bear Plunge every year on January 1 at noon, where event participants run into the cold waters of Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene at Sanders Beach.

One of the most well-attended events in the region combines Art on the Green, the Street Fair, and Taste of Coeur d&#x27;Alene, which are all held on the first weekend in August on the North Idaho College campus, downtown Coeur d&#x27;Alene, and City Park. Art on the Green is an outdoor arts and crafts festival, Street Fair is a shopping festival, and the Taste of Coeur d&#x27;Alene is a food festival; the combined annual attendance is about 60,000 people. Other notable events include Brewfest and the North Idaho State Fair.

==Sports==
Coeur d&#x27;Alene has become a destination for golf enthusiasts. The city is home to five golf courses and there are another eight more within . Coeur d&#x27;Alene Resort Golf Course is considered one of the best resort courses in the United States. Its 14th hole features the world&#x27;s only movable floating green. There is also the Circling Raven Golf Club at the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Casino resort, as well as several other private courses nearby, such the Tom Fazio-designed Gozzer Ranch.

Coeur d&#x27;Alene hosts some sporting events, and the event that receives the most attention is most likely the Ironman Coeur d&#x27;Alene. The Ironman Triathlon alternates between full- and half-distance Ironman events on a rotating basis from year to year. The course takes athletes through a double-loop swim in Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene before transitioning to a double-loop bike course that is routed along the lake and then through the countryside, ending in a multiple-loop run through McEuen Park to a finish in downtown on Sherman Ave. Other less intense and rigorous athletic events in town include the Coeur d&#x27;Fondo bike race and the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Crossing, a swimming challenge in which participants attempt to cross the lake. The Coeur d&#x27;Alene marathon is held annually at the end of May on the North Idaho Centennial Trail.

In amateur baseball, Coeur d&#x27;Alene fields a team in the American Legion Baseball league, the CDA Lumbermen. In high school team sports, there is an annual rivalry game between the Coeur d&#x27;Alene High School Vikings and Lake City High School Timberwolves called the &quot;Fight for the Fish&quot;. The schools are the only two public high schools in the city and both compete in Idaho&#x27;s Inland Empire League. The city is also home to Kyle Manzardo, professional baseball player for the Cleveland Guardians

==Parks and recreation==
The natural environment is among the chief attractions in the Coeur d&#x27;Alene area. The biggest natural attractions and parks include Tubbs Hill, City Park and Beach, and McEuen Park, all near downtown. Tubbs Hill is a park that is bordered by downtown Coeur d&#x27;Alene and McEuen Park to the north and the by Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene on the south, east, and west sides. The park features a somewhat rugged interpretive trail that offers views of the lake and the city. People often cliff jump into the lake from outcroppings in the park. City Park occupies in total along the lake shore near downtown and features of beach with a tree lined promenade, beach volleyball courts, basketball courts, public drinking, restroom, and shower facilities, picnic tables, and a large picnic shelter for events, and a Fort Sherman themed playground for children. McEuen Park, which reopened in 2014 after a remodel, is a park just north of Tubbs Hill that has a large playground, children&#x27;s climbing rock, splash pad, two tennis/pickleball courts, four basketball courts, and an off leash dog park. It also features a large pavilion and grassy amphitheater with concessions and restrooms for hosting large events as well as a boat launch and mooring facilities. Other recreation facilities include the Kroc Center, located near Ramsey Park just north of the Village at Riverstone, a multi-use venue with pool facilities and a fitness and recreation center.

The North Idaho Centennial Trail passes through the city.

==Government==

The community operates on a mayor–council government, where the mayor and the six councilors are each elected to four-year terms and the mayor leads the city council meetings on the first and third Tuesday of each month at Coeur d&#x27;Alene City Hall. The city is also the county seat of Kootenai County, Idaho.

At the state level, The City of Coeur d&#x27;Alene is within Idaho Legislative District 2 and Idaho Legislative District 4 for the Idaho House of Representatives and Idaho Senate. At the federal level, north Idaho is within Idaho&#x27;s 1st congressional district and represented by Russ Fulcher in the United States House of Representatives and the state of Idaho by Mike Crapo and James Risch in the United States Senate.

Coeur d&#x27;Alene, like the state of Idaho as a whole, is known for its conservative politics. The city and Kootenai County vote reliably conservative, and races at the federal and state level are often noncompetitive; local county and city partisan races are sometimes even uncontested. The changing demographics of the county and region have altered the political landscape of the community and can be viewed as part of a nationwide ideological polarization trend. North Idaho had once been made up of largely progressive districts populated by a significant proportion of union laborers who worked the mines in the Silver Valley; these districts moderated, particularly in the 1980s, after mine and mill closures and union busting, and they had more competitive elections until the late 20th century. Coeur d&#x27;Alene is among a small group of cities in the United States that has elected a socialist mayor; they elected John T. Wood, a Socialist Party of America member, to office in 1911 on a campaign platform of clean water, better health and sanitation standards, and anti-corruption. Since the high-growth period beginning in the 1990s, continuing outmigration of conservatives from the west coast states has made elections in the two-party system less competitive over time as the newer residents see the city as a place that represents their social and political values, which are sometimes more conservative than the city as a whole. Many of the new migrants to the state of Idaho came from California, which accounted for over half the net in-migration between 1992 and 2000 and three of the top four counties that had out-migration to Kootenai County were from the birthplace of modern American conservatism in southern California–San Diego, Los Angeles, and Orange.

==Education==
Library services for the city of Coeur d&#x27;Alene are provided by two public libraries, the Coeur d&#x27;alene Public Library in downtown and the Lake City Public Library near Lake City High School. The Community Library Network maintains seven libraries in the wider communities in Kootenai and Shoshone counties, including branches in Post Falls, Hayden, Rathdrum, Spirit Lake, Athol, and Harrison. Public library services in the area trace their roots to the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Women&#x27;s Club in October 1904 and its operations and funding responsibilities were taken over by the city in May 1909.

The Coeur d&#x27;Alene School District serves around 11,000 students in 18 schools, including two traditional high schools, an alternative high school, three middle schools, eleven elementary schools, and a dropout retrieval school. The first high school in the city, Coeur d&#x27;Alene High School, had its first building to house the students completed in 1904 and a second public high school, Lake City High School, was opened in 1994. District students who qualify are also eligible for dual enrollment with North Idaho College and the University of Idaho. The district also has magnet schools that focus on specific curricula, such as the Sorensen Magnet School of the Arts and Humanities and Ramsey Magnet School of Science elementary schools and the Fernan STEM Academy, offering a STEM focus.
The district is the sixth-largest in the state and second-largest employer in Kootenai County. Coeur d&#x27;Alene also has a charter school, the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Charter Academy. Private and parochial schools augment the public school system, such as the PK-8 grade Roman Catholic Holy Family Catholic School and the PK-8 grade Seventh-day Adventist Lake City Academy. Private schools that offer a full high school curriculum include the PK-12 grade Classical Christian Academy and the 1–12 grade North Idaho Christian School which are both non-denominational ASCI-accredited Christian schools located in Hayden.

Postsecondary education is fulfilled by North Idaho College, a public community college founded in 1933 as the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Junior College in downtown Coeur d&#x27;Alene on the former site of Fort Sherman. The college has an enrollment of over 5,000 students and has outreach branches in Kellogg, Sandpoint, and Bonners Ferry. The University of Idaho has a Coeur d&#x27;Alene presence and has a research park in the area.

==Media==

Coeur d&#x27;Alene is part of the Spokane television and radio media market and receives broadcasts in the Pacific Time Zone. Coeur d&#x27;Alene is the city of license for some television and radio stations in the broadcast area, such as Idaho Public Television station, KCDT. In print media, Coeur d&#x27;Alene is also covered by Spokane&#x27;s major daily newspaper, &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot;, but the city has its own daily newspaper, the &quot;Coeur d&#x27;Alene Press&quot;, which covers issues in North Idaho and has an estimated circulation of about 17,300. The publication was founded in 1892 by Joseph T. Scott and printed its first issue on February 20 of that year. The newspaper is among the properties of the Hagadone Corporation.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Roads and highways====

In Coeur d&#x27;Alene, the city roads are oriented in the four cardinal directions, with roads going north–south being designated as &quot;streets&quot; and roads going east–west as &quot;avenues&quot;. Sherman Avenue divides the streets into north and south, and Government Way divides the avenues into east and west. Major east–west thoroughfares include Sherman Avenue and Harrison Avenue and major north–south thoroughfares include U.S. Route 95 (US 95), Government Way, 15th Street, and Ramsey Street. Coeur d&#x27;Alene is accessed from Interstate 90 (I-90) at exits 11 through 15. Not too far to the east on I-90 is the Fourth of July Pass and further east near the Montana border is Lookout Pass that traverse the Rocky Mountains near Mullan, Idaho. The route of the Interstate east of Coeur d&#x27;Alene closely mirrors that of the old Mullan Road, although I-90 crosses the Fourth of July Pass south of John Mullan&#x27;s passage, which was carved out using pickaxes and shovels on July 4, 1861, and is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places and marked by a monument. Before the construction of I-90, the city was served by US 10, which ran through downtown; this route is now Northwest Boulevard and Sherman Avenue. The former US 10, between I-90 exits 11 and 15, is now designated as I-90 Business. I-90 was completed on October 14, 1960, and dedicated by Governor Robert E. Smylie 10 days later as the state&#x27;s first major Interstate Highway project to be completed. Major state highways in the area include State Highway 41 (SH 41) and US 95. SH 41 has its southern terminus in Post Falls and is routed from I-90 northward to the Newport, Washington area, where it is in the vicinity of US 2, and US 95 runs north to south across the whole of western Idaho, connecting the city with Sandpoint to the north and Moscow, Lewiston, and eventually Boise to the south. Originally an exclusively in-state highway when it was proposed by the United States Numbered Highway System in 1925, spanning from the Canadian border to Payette, it is significant for connecting the long-disconnected northern panhandle to the rest of the state; prior to the construction of US 95, one would have to travel through Washington and Oregon for passage to avoid the mountainous topography. The portion of its route that it shares with US 2 is a National Scenic Byway and part of the International Selkirk Loop. In Coeur d&#x27;Alene, US 95 runs north to south, crossing the Spokane River and serving as an arterial street for the suburbs to the north.

The greater Coeur d&#x27;Alene area is almost entirely dependent upon private automobiles for transportation, the city has a Walk Score of 36, indicating most errands require a car. Combined with the city&#x27;s rapid growth since 1990, relative congestion now occurs on a significant portion of the area highways, notably U.S. 95 between Northwest Blvd. north to Hayden. The average commute to work is 18.5 minutes.

====Public transportation====

Public transportation played a significant role in Coeur d&#x27;Alene&#x27;s early growth as a tourist destination. When an interurban electric railroad line was completed in 1903 from Spokane to the city, Inland Northwest residents often flocked to Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene to enjoy being on the lake and going on steamboat cruises and other activities. The interurban electric line would later become the Spokane and Inland Empire Railroad. The steamboats on Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene were not only used to transport goods such as ore and timber, but also people. More steamboats operated on Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene than on any other lake west of the Great Lakes, and there were intense rivalries between the steamboat lines. The electric railroad and steam navigation on Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene lasted until the late 1930s.

Free public bus service is available to area residents, provided by Citylink. Citylink buses operate in the urbanized area of Kootenai County, leaving the Riverstone Transfer Station main hub every hour, seven days a week, including holidays. Buses are wheelchair-accessible and can transport up to two bicycles. The bus system has four separate routes:
Urban Route B which serves Post Falls, Hayden and West Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Urban Route C which serves Downtown Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Fernan and Hayden, Rural Route, which serves the towns of Worley, Plummer, Tensed, and De Smet, and the Link Route, which connects the two transfer stations at Riverstone and Worley. Extension of Spokane Transit Authority service into Idaho, mainly an hourly express bus to and from Coeur d&#x27;Alene, originally proposed as part of the 2015 &quot;STA Moving Forward&quot; ballot measure, is expected to commence in 2025.

Intercity bus service to the city is provided by Jefferson Lines.

====Passenger rail====
Coeur d&#x27;Alene does not have a passenger railroad station. The closest Amtrak stations are Spokane and Sandpoint, both of which are served by Amtrak&#x27;s Empire Builder.

====Airports====
The closest major airport serving Coeur d&#x27;Alene and North Idaho is Spokane International Airport, which is served by six airlines and is to the west in Spokane, Washington. The Coeur d&#x27;Alene Airport – Pappy Boyington Field (KCOE) serves as a general aviation airport in Hayden, north of the city near U.S. 95. The airport was built by the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1942 as a fighter and light bomber training base. The Coeur d&#x27;Alene Airport was designated as an alternate airport to Weeks Field (now the site of the Kootenai County Fairgrounds) in the event of an Axis invasion; the Weeks Field airport was also used to train pilots during World War II. It is named in honor of World War II flying ace and North Idaho native, Gregory &quot;Pappy&quot; Boyington.

Near the marina on Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene is the Brooks Seaplane Base (S76), which is a city-owned, public-use seaplane base for general aviation. It is used mostly for air taxi purposes to conduct tours of Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene and Lake Pend Oreille.

===Utilities===
The city of Coeur d&#x27;Alene provides billing services for municipal water, sewer and stormwater management, street lighting, garbage collection, and recycling; Kootenai Electric Cooperative provides power and Avista Utilities provides both power and natural gas services in the area. The city draws its water supply from the Spokane Valley–Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer. Telecom services such as television, internet, and telephone service are provided by vendors including Frontier Communications, Spectrum, Time Warner, and TDS Telecom.

The Post Falls hydroelectric dam on the Spokane River was built in 1906 and has a generation capacity of 14.75 megawatts.

===Healthcare===

Kootenai Health is the primary medical center serving the Coeur d&#x27;Alene and North Idaho communities. The 329-bed community hospital is a Level III trauma center and is the largest employer in Kootenai County. Coeur d&#x27;Alene also has a Veterans Affairs Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC), the North Idaho CBOC, which has the Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center in Spokane as a parent facility. Public health programs and services for Idaho&#x27;s five northernmost counties are administered by the Panhandle Health District, one of seven health districts in the state, with a local office in Hayden.

===Police===
The Coeur d&#x27;Alene Police Department was established in 1887, shortly after Coeur d&#x27;Alene was incorporated as a town; one of the first official acts the Board of Trustees took was to appoint a Town Marshal. The police department has 103 police officers as of September 2020. In addition to the officers on staff, the department has a program called Officers Without Legal Standing (OWLS), which consists of retired law enforcement officers of various backgrounds from California who render assistance and aid as unpaid volunteers. Coeur d&#x27;Alene and North Idaho have been favored retirement destinations for former California law enforcement for decades, the trend being reported on as early as 1986 by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. By the end of the 1990s, the number of retired California police officers in North Idaho numbered over 500; former LAPD detective Mark Fuhrman is among its residents.

==Sister cities==
Coeur d&#x27;Alene has one sister city, which is the Canadian city of Cranbrook, British Columbia.

Harrison developed from a squatters homestead to a thriving village in about twelve years. A branch of the O.R. &amp; N. Railroad from Tekoa, Washington, to Harrison was completed in 1890 and was a prime factor in the development of Harrison.

In 1891, Silas W. Crane settled on a timbered tract which joins the present city on the south and east. He built the first house in Harrison which remained in the Crane family until 1936. The building is now used as the Crane House Museum. The same year Fred Grant purchased the Fisher Brothers Sawmill in St. Maries and moved it to Harrison. Known as Grants Mill, it had a capacity of 60 thousand feet per day.

In 1892, S.W. Crane opened a general store. The first post office was established in 1893, the name was chosen and W.E. Crane became the first postmaster. W.S. Bridgeman opened a Gen. Merc. in 1893, and another general store was opened in 1894 by W.A. Reiniger.

The first newspaper, &quot;The Signal&quot;, was established in 1895, later it was known as the &quot;Mountain Messenger&quot; and in 1900 became known as &quot;The Searchlight&quot;. A paper with that name is still published annually by the Oldtime Picnic Committee.

In 1895, a Methodist church was erected and School District #29 was formed. The first year of school was taught by Mr. Edelbute in the Methodist Church. The first school was erected in 1896 and by 1903 there were 59 students.

The original townsite was in the form of a triangle and covered approximately . The Village of Harrison was incorporated on July 21, 1899. The first meeting of the board of trustees for the Village of Harrison was held July 24, 1899. George W. Thompson was elected chairman.

In August 1905, a Spokane company was granted a franchise to put in a water system with a pumping plant at a cost of $20,000. An electric light plant was also installed in 1901 by Kimmel Brothers at a cost of $8,000.

The following year came the telephone, connecting Harrison with points up the St. Joe and Coeur d’Alene rivers. Rocky Mountain Bell purchased the property later that year and Harrison was connected to the outside world.

The next few years saw the opening of the First National Bank of Harrison, the Opera House, various drug, grocery, hardware, furniture, clothing &amp; jewelry stores along with tailoring, blacksmithing and shoemaker shops, and restaurants, hotels and a hospital. For a time around the turn of the century, Harrison was the largest town in Kootenai County; the city directory in 1911 reported a population of 1,250. Harrison&#x27;s growth was a result of the development of eight or more sawmills &amp; box factories. With the mills and woods jobs, approx. 280 men were employed with a combined monthly payroll around $25,000. Millions of board feet of timber were stored in the lake at Harrison. Lake Coeur d’Alene and the St.Joe and Coeur d’Alene rivers were the major transportation routes for timber coming out of the areas forests.

In 1917, the Grant Lumber Company caught fire and the ensuing blaze consumed about half of the residential area of Harrison and about half of the business district. Much of the town was never rebuilt. The easiest way to get to Harrison was by water. The OWR&amp;N Company which absorbed the OR&amp;N railroad, constructed a 600-passenger steamer called “The Harrison” for transportation. There were several other steamers such as the Georgie Oakes that carried passengers and freight making the depot a popular place for area children. Passenger service was discontinued in the early 1920s but they continued to haul freight until 1932 when the line was abandoned.

Many early day photos are on display at the Crane Historical Society Museum along with a lot of information about Harrison. Community spirit continues today with the Old Time Picnic, which is always held the last weekend in July.

Harrison&#x27;s trail head for the Trail of the Coeur d&#x27;Alenes rail trail is a welcome addition to the area and helps to keep the town &quot;alive&quot; during the off season of lake traffic. The Trail is of easy riding and runs from Plummer to Mullan on the former right-of-way of the Union Pacific Railroad. In the mid-2010s, a Resort Condominiums International was constructed at Arrow Point on Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene just north of town.

Harrison is located south of Interstate 90 on the Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene Scenic Byway, Highway 97.

The Coeur d&#x27;Alene River flows into Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene on Harrison&#x27;s northern edge. The lower reaches of the river&#x27;s valley are filled with smaller lakes, and as such water dominates much of the local geography. The Saint Joe Mountains of the Bitterroot Range rise high above the flat lakes around Harrison.

<doc id="110723" wikidata="Q1515168" url="?curid=110723" title="Hayden, Idaho">
<text>Hayden is a city in Kootenai County, Idaho, United States. Located in the northern portion of the state, it is a suburb of nearby Coeur d&#x27;Alene and its population was 15,570 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The origins of the city of Hayden has its roots in the history of Hayden Lake. The Coeur D’Alene tribe territory centered around Hayden Lake and nearby Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene, gathering plants, including abundant huckleberries, fish and wildlife found there. The first white man to visit what is now Hayden Lake was Father DeSmet while serving as a missionary to the Coeur d’Alene Indians. While visiting, he named it Lake DeNuf and recorded several stories told by the local tribe about the lake and the surrounding area.

In the 1870s, the Lake Hayden area began attracting white settlers due to the surrounding fertile soils and rich timber resources. Legend has it that three settlers, Mat Heyden (a soldier from Fort Sherman), John Hager and John Hickey played a game of Seven-Up poker to decide who would name the lake. Mat Heyden won and eventually the spelling became standardized to Hayden. Heyden planted the first orchard in the area and established his farm on the western shore of Lake Hayden.

Development centered on this side of the lake, with its close proximity to Coeur d’Alene. At the turn of the century at least three sawmills were located on the lake. One of the mills became part of the Atlas Tie Company, supplying railroad ties across Idaho. During the early 20th century, steamboats plied the waters of Lake Hayden, serving the mills and communities around the lake.

Part of John Hickey&#x27;s land claim along Hayden Lake became Avondale Cottage, a resort built in 1903. In 1906, investors expanded and reinvented the property into Bozanta Tavern. The Swiss Chalet-inspired hotel was designed by Spokane architect KK Cutter and the grounds were designed by John Charles Olmsted, one of the Olmsted Brothers who designed New York&#x27;s Central Park. The popularity of the resort was encouraged when the Spokane and Inland Empire Railroad extended a trolley line that connected the area with Coeur d’Alene. This also made the resort easily accessible to the booming city of Spokane, WA, it attracted thousands of visitors to the area. The resort became so well known that both Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft visited Bozanta. In 1910, F. Lewis Clark, a Spokane millionaire, built on the shores of Lake Hayden what was at the time considered to be the largest and most expensive house in Idaho.

Around the turn of the century, a schoolhouse began to be constructed on the shores of Lake Hayden, but was moved before its completion to make way for the Bozanta Tavern. The school building was moved closer to Government Way and finished there. In 1936 an Art Deco-inspired building was built and it still stands there today.

James Monaghan established the first general store near Lake Hayden, located approximately a half mile east of Government Way along Honeysuckle Avenue. A post office was also established there for a couple of years before relocating, along with the store, closer to Bozanta Tavern. This area, which had a stop on the electric trolley line, was developed by the Granite Investment Company, of which James Mongahan was president. Development around Monaghan and the surrounding countryside was encouraged by irrigation installed by the Malloy Brothers who established the Interstate Irrigation company. They bought up thousands of acres in the area and installed irrigation pipes from Hayden Lake.

As the logging and mining industry grew, and encouraged by irrigation from Hayden Lake, farms and businesses developed around on the west end of the lake to serve the workers. In 1906, DC Corbin took advantage of the high tariff on sugar, bought land north of the Hayden area and hired Japanese workers to farm sugar beets. Many white settlers moved into the area to prove up homesteads under the Homestead Act and the Timber and Stone Act, and worked in the logging and resort industries to help make ends meet. The area also saw poultry and dairy farms established, and by the 1920s, cherry and apple orchards were prolific.  The first fruit packing plant in the area was established in 1914 and the Seiter Cannery in Post Falls was located nearby. After cold winters in the 1930s ruined many of the trees, many orchards were not replanted.

Government Way, the main road connecting the area with Coeur d’Alene, bypassed the shores of Lake Hayden by a mile and a half. With the advent of the automobile, the center of the town shifted from the lake and railroad and reoriented towards Government Way. A collection of businesses slowly developed at the intersection of Honeysuckle Avenue which connected the lake community with Government Way. By the 1950s, Government Way was designated as Highway 95 and the community of businesses servicing travelers and locals was called Hayden Village. Meanwhile, the community located on the shores of Lake Hayden became Hayden Lake. In 1972, Highway 95 was moved slightly West to reduce traffic on the main road through Hayden.

The population numbered 718 people in 1950. In 1955, the owners of Sargent&#x27;s Restaurant in Hayden Village wanted to procure a liquor license. They were stalled by Idaho&#x27;s alcohol laws. Hayden Village next sought to be annexed into Hayden Lake. When that failed, the “movers and shakers” of the area had a meeting and decided the area should incorporate. The Village of Hayden was incorporated in 1955 with a total of 440 acres with a population of around 700 people. Sargent&#x27;s Restaurant was able to move forward in procuring its first liquor license and the City of Hayden in Kootenai County was established.

<text>Hayden Lake is a city in Kootenai County, Idaho, United States. Located in the northern portion of the state, it is considered a suburb of the city of Coeur d&#x27;Alene. Its population was 574 at the 2010 census. The city was named after the nearby Lake Hayden, which is now more commonly also known as Hayden Lake, after the city.

The city is located around the Hayden Lake Country Club and a small portion of the northern part of the lake. Most of the lake is surrounded by the larger city of Hayden. The shores of the lake are filled with summer cabins to large historical and modern mansions and the historic Hayden Lake Country Club lies at the center of the community.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Geology===
Hayden Lake, like Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene and other lakes surrounding the Spokane Valley and Rathdrum Prairie, was formed by the Missoula Floods, most recently 12,000 to 15,000 years ago. The Purcell Lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet flowed south from Canada, carving the basin of present-day Lake Pend Oreille and damming the Clark Fork river. The impounded river repeatedly filled to form Glacial Lake Missoula and broke through the ice dam, resulting in massive floods that filled the Rathdrum Prairie area with sand, gravel, and boulders. Large eddy bars formed downstream from bedrock obstructions, thereby damming tributary valleys and creating lakes.

==History==
The Coeur D’Alene tribe territory centered around what is now Hayden Lake and nearby Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene, gathering plants, including abundant huckleberries, fish and wildlife. The first white man to visit the area was Father DeSmet while serving as a missionary to the Coeur d’Alene Indians. While visiting, he named it Lake DeNuf and recorded several stories told by the local tribe about the lake and the surrounding area.

Hayden Lake&#x27;s natural beauty attracted several wealthy people in the early 1900s. The F. Lewis Clark Mansion was built in 1910, and was the most expensive home in Idaho at the time. In 1914, Lewis mysteriously disappeared and was never seen or heard from again. In 1907, the Hayden Lake Country Club became a gathering place for many area socialites, such as Bing Crosby. A railway expansion made travel easy from nearby Spokane. HLCC opened the first 18-hole golf course in the state of Idaho in 1912.

From the 1970s until 2001, the neo-Nazi Aryan Nations had its headquarters in a compound in Kootenai County near Hayden Lake. In September 2000, the Southern Poverty Law Center won a $6.3 million judgment against the Aryan Nations from an Idaho jury, who awarded punitive and compensatory damages to Victoria Keenan and her son, Jason, who were attacked by Aryan Nations guards in 1999. Bullets struck the Keenans&#x27; car several times, then the car crashed and an Aryan member held the Keenans at gunpoint. As a result of the judgment, Richard Butler turned the compound over to the Keenans, who then sold the property to a philanthropist who subsequently donated it to North Idaho College, which designated the land as a &quot;peace park&quot;.

<doc id="110725" wikidata="Q1510757" url="?curid=110725" title="Huetter, Idaho">
<text>Huetter is a city in Kootenai County, Idaho, United States. The population was 100 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. This makes Huetter the smallest incorporated city in the United States in terms of area.

==Mayoral controversy==
Bradley Keene and Jennifer Brown were among a group of young people who attempted a takeover of Huetter by running for mayor and city councilor, respectively, in 2007. Keene was elected, ousting longtime mayor Jackie Meeks, as was Brown; just 32 people voted in the election.

However, a District judge ruled in May 2008 that Keene and Brown were ineligible to serve their term because the county had kicked them off voter registration rolls earlier in the year, a result of them not responding to challenges of their Huetter residency during the election. Keene then appealed the decision. In the ensuing two years Huetter had no official mayor, due to the litigation over the position; however, Keene had been serving as acting mayor since being elected to the city council in 2009.

Finally, in 2010, the Idaho Supreme Court ruled that the District Court had misinterpreted state statute in concluding that Keene&#x27;s and Brown&#x27;s positions became vacant when their voter registration was temporarily canceled after their election. The opinion reversed the removal of Keene and Brown (who later moved out of Huetter, and her council position was filled). Keene was re-elected mayor in 2011, running unopposed.

==History==

In the 1800s the town was initially called Westwood in honor of one of the founders of the town, a Pony Express rider and rancher, Charles Wesley Wood, also known as &quot;Wes.&quot; But in 1881 the postmaster in the town was informed by the federal government that the town would need to change its name since it was already taken by another town in the territory. A local businessman, Michael M. Cowley, recommended the name &quot;Rathdrum&quot; from County Wicklow in Ireland, his place of birth.

Near the end of the 19th century, the Northern Pacific Railway built its line westwards to Spokane and Rathdrum started to grow slowly. Until today, Rathdrum remains on the only regular railway line in Idaho, now owned by BNSF Railway; the Empire Builder of Amtrak travels through Rathdrum without stopping there.

<text>Potlatch is a city in the northwest United States, located in north central Idaho in Latah County, about east of the border with Washington. On the Palouse north of Moscow, it is served by State Highway 6, and bordered on the northeast by the small community of Onaway. The population of Potlatch was 804 at the 2010 census.

==History==
===Company town===
In 1903, Frederick Weyerhaeuser incorporated the Potlatch Lumber Company (eventually becoming the Potlatch Corporation), naming his son Charles as the President. The directors of the company selected Canadian lumberman William Deary to build a mill somewhere within the company&#x27;s timber holdings. The townsite was chosen because of proximity to the company&#x27;s large holdings of Western White Pine on the Palouse River. Potlatch was chosen as the mill site, and in 1904, crews working under W.A. Wilkinson of Minnesota began constructing what would be the largest white pine sawmill in the world.

Because of the remote placement of the mill, Potlatch was built as a company town to provide housing and commerce for the mill. A total of 143 houses were built in 1906, with 58 more built the following year; other building constructed during that period include boarding houses, an ice house, a Catholic church, hotel, school, and general store.

The company developed and ran Potlatch on a model mostly patterned after that used by Pullman Company for its company town in Illinois. It provide police and fire protection, a school, churches, a hospital, an inexpensive company store, and recreational amenities. It banned prostitution, prohibited alcohol, and encouraged its workers to marry by allowing only married couples to rent the houses it owned. The paternalism was profitable, even though rents were low: during 1943 the company showed a profit of $59,000 for its &quot;townsite&quot; services. Less than a decade later, with labor costs significantly reducing its townsite profit, the mill sold most of the homes and other buildings it owned, and Potlatch was incorporated.

On the west side of town, the mill began operating on September 11, 1906, and continued for over seven decades. Due to a depressed economy and declining lumber prices, the mill closed in August 1981.

===Following the mill&#x27;s closure===
In 1981, the mill was shut down, shortly after the town was sold to the residents. Five years later, part of the commercial district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

After the mill&#x27;s closure, Potlatch became a bedroom community for the university towns of Moscow and Pullman, Washington.

Business and political leaders of Potlatch are making a concerted effort to attract companies involved in the firearms industry; they have set aside for such businesses, located on the former site of the mill. Approximately a mile (1.6 km) west of the mill, State Highway 6 connects with U.S. Route 95, Idaho&#x27;s primary north-south highway.

<text>Craigmont is a city in the northwest United States in Lewis County, Idaho. Located on the Camas Prairie in north central Idaho, it is within the Nez Perce Indian Reservation. The population was 501 at the 2010 census, down from 556 in 2000.

==History==
The city is named for Colonel William Craig (1809–69), a mountain man who had a Nez Perce wife. He settled at Lapwai near his father-in-law Hin-mah-tute-ke-kaikt or James in 1840 when he gave up being a fur trapper due to the collapse of the market for beaver.

The Nez Perce Reservation was opened to white settlement in 1895, and a town named &quot;Chicago,&quot; a mile west of the current Craigmont, was founded in 1898. In response to not getting their mail from the post office, it was renamed &quot;Ilo&quot; four years later, after Ilo Leggett, daughter of town founder and merchant W.O. Leggett. A fire burnt the town in 1904 and shortly thereafter the Camas Prairie Railroad bypassed the town and started a settlement, platted by Lewiston financier John P. Vollmer, on the northeast side of the railroad tracks, and he named it &quot;Vollmer.&quot; Ilo responded and moved its community to the southwest side of the tracks, adjacent to Vollmer. After a decade-long feud and the consolidation of the school districts, the communities merged in 1920 to become Craigmont.

==Geography==

After several ownership changes since 1998, the line from Spalding is now operated by BG&amp;CM Railroad and terminates in Cottonwood. Passenger service on the Camas Prairie ended in 1955. Lawyers Canyon is named after Chief Lawyer (1801–76) of the Nez Perce, nicknamed for his skill in dealing with the encroaching whites; he is buried in Kamiah.

===Highways===
* - US 95 - to Lewiston, Moscow (north) and Grangeville, Boise (via ) (south)

Northbound U.S. Route 95 was formerly routed westward through Craigmont as Main Street, then resumed westward toward Winchester. The highway was re-routed in 1991 and now bypasses Craigmont on its south side. Southbound, the new route between Craigmont and Ferdinand stays out of the canyon, crossing it on a bridge (photo) which opened in October 1991 and passes over the site of the previous bridge, built in 1948. After the bridge, the southbound highway passes to the east of Ferdinand, a new routing completed in 1993.

Eastbound from Craigmont, State Highway 62 connects to Nezperce, the county seat.

<text>Winchester is a city in western Lewis County, Idaho, United States, located on the Camas Prairie in the north central part of the state. The population was 356 at the 2020 census, up from 340 in 2010. Winchester Lake State Park lies south of the city.

==History==

Winchester is within the Nez Perce Indian Reservation, and similar to the opening of lands in Oklahoma, the U.S. government opened the reservation for white settlement in November 1895. The proclamation had been signed less than two weeks earlier by President Cleveland.

The city was named in 1900 during a meeting to establish a school district. While considering the possibilities, an individual looked at the stack of Winchester rifles at the door and suggested the name, which was approved. The sawmill closed in May 1965 after the mature timber in the area had been cut. The mill was operated by Boise Cascade for its final five years; its closure followed a fire which destroyed much of downtown Winchester in November 1964.

A outside of town is Winchester Lake State Park, planned in 1966 and established in 1969. Originally it was a mill pond, created in 1910 by damming Lapwai Creek. Water quality issues at the lake were addressed with the installation of aeration units in 2002.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

Winchester is located on the northern shore of Lapwai Lake at the location where Lapwai Creek emerges from the lake. U.S. Route 95 passes about a mile to the northeast of Winchester, but the town is connected to the highway by a business route of U.S. 95. It is located in the broader Camas Prairie region.

===Highway===
* - US 95 - to Lewiston (north) and Grangeville (south)

The city is west of U.S. Route 95, which connects it to Craigmont to the east and Lewiston to the northwest, via the Lapwai Canyon.

Until 1960, US 95 was routed through Winchester on this spur and descended Culdesac Hill (), considered the worst of the three major grades (White Bird, Lewiston), all of which were extremely twisty. The new route through Lapwai Canyon was built in three years and reduced the distance by over and saved 25 minutes of driving time. The earlier road was completed in 1923. The first organized road race on the old road took place in 1964; among the participants in the hill climb was Bob Knievel of Butte, Montana, later known as Evel Knievel.

The timber trestles of the former Camas Prairie Railroad are visible throughout the area.

==Education==
The public schools are in Craigmont, operated by the Highland Joint School District #305, led by Highland High School. The consolidated district was formed in 1962; prior to that Winchester had its own schools and the high school&#x27;s mascot was a logger.

==In popular culture==
In the television series &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, the episode “The Thirty-Caliber Town” dramatized how Winchester rifles gave the town its name. An epilogue featuring host Robert Taylor and Lester Shadduck, the mayor of Winchester, was shot on location in 1967.

<doc id="110746" wikidata="Q1517737" url="?curid=110746" title="Shoshone, Idaho">
<text>Shoshone ( ) is the county seat and largest city of Lincoln County, Idaho, United States. The population was 1,653 at the 2020 census. In contrast to the Shoshone Native American tribe for which it is named, the city&#x27;s name is correctly pronounced &quot;Show-shown&quot;, with a silent &quot;e&quot;.

== History ==
Founded in 1882 during the construction of the Oregon Short Line, Shoshone has long been considered the main railroad station in south central Idaho&#x27;s Magic Valley region. The much larger community of Twin Falls to the south never developed a strong railroad presence due to the logistical issues presented by its location south of the Snake River Canyon. For many years, Shoshone was the only Amtrak stop in south central Idaho.

The Union Pacific Railroad opened the Sun Valley resort in 1936 (and owned it until 1964), and its pre-existing spur route to Ketchum connected here. The spur first headed northeast, following today&#x27;s to Richfield and Tikura, then peeled northwest to Picabo and on to Bellevue, Hailey, and Ketchum, so the distance was greater than today&#x27;s more direct drive north on 

About north of Shoshone are the Shoshone Ice Caves. The caves are lava tubes that stay cool enough for the ice inside them to remain frozen throughout the summer. In the days before refrigeration, this feature, coupled with the railroad, made Shoshone popular with travelers as &quot;the only place for hundreds of miles where one could get a cold beer.&quot;

== Economy ==
Today, Shoshone still has one bar, but also boasts a cafe, a movie theater, and a grocery store—unusual for such a small town. While limited retail jobs exist, Shoshone is primarily a farming and dairy community.

Shoshone is home to a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) facility. The town also has a small medical clinic, and recently built a new K-12 school building.

In recent years, Shoshone has become a bedroom community for workers of neighboring Blaine County, due to a significant difference in cost of living. The resort cities of Ketchum and Sun Valley are about an hour north on Highway 75. This commuting phenomenon has contributed greatly to recent growth in the Shoshone area. Shoshone also has a few historical buildings.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. The Little Wood River runs through the town.

Much of the land around Shoshone is lava rock, which can make excavation for building problematic, and limits the amount of useful farmland.

=== Climate ===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Shoshone has a cold semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;).

==Highways==
* - US 26
* - US 93
* - SH-24
* - SH-75 - &quot;Sawtooth Scenic Byway&quot;

The four highways converge in Shoshone, the southern terminus of SH 75. Traffic between the Magic Valley and Sun Valley passes through Shoshone, maintaining its early heritage as a brief rest stop for travelers.

<doc id="110747" wikidata="Q818311" url="?curid=110747" title="Rexburg, Idaho">
<text>Rexburg is a city in Madison County, Idaho, United States. The population was 39,409 at the 2020 census. The city is the county seat of Madison County and its largest city. Rexburg is the principal city of the Rexburg, ID Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes Fremont and Madison counties. The city is home to Brigham Young University–Idaho (BYU-Idaho), a private institution operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

==History==
The city takes its name from founder Thomas Edwin Ricks. The city was incorporated in 1883.

The Navy Electronics Laboratory oceanographic research ship USS &quot;Rexburg&quot; was named for the city.

In June 1976, Rexburg was severely damaged by the Teton Dam Flood. The Teton River flowed through northern Rexburg, and left most of the city underwater for several days after the Teton Dam ruptured. A museum dedicated to the Teton Dam Flood and the history of Rexburg and the area, located in the basement of the Rexburg Tabernacle, has been a major city landmark for decades.

The city gained attention after the murders of Tylee Ryan and J.J. Vallow, two siblings who went missing in September 2019 and were found dead in June 2020.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Much of the city, including BYU-Idaho and the Rexburg Idaho Temple, rests on top of a shield volcano just north of Rigby. Eruptions are not expected in the near future so far south; Yellowstone National Park and Island Park are thought to be the most likely settings for future volcanic activity in the area. Many different types of volcanoes exist near Rexburg, including cinder cones, spatter cones, other shield volcanoes, and volcanic fissures. There are lava fields to the west and south of Rexburg, the results of open fissure eruptions from about two thousand years ago. The nearby Craters of the Moon National Monument presents the most obvious features of this recent activity. Sediment deposits enriched by volcanism make the surrounding area famous for its production of large starch-rich potatoes.

Rexburg is close to the St. Anthony Sand Dunes, the West Entrance of Yellowstone National Park and the Teton Range.

==Climate==
From a technical standpoint, Rexburg experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;&quot;Dfb&quot;&quot;) with freezing winters and warm—if chilly at night—summers, and frosts have occurred in all months of the year.

The wettest year has been 1983 with and the driest has been 1988 with including rainless months in July and October, though the wettest month was June 2009 with .
