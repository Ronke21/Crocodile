<text>South Pasadena is a city in Los Angeles County, California, United States. As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 25,619, up from 24,292 in the 2000 census. It is located in the Western San Gabriel Valley. It is in area and lies between the city of Pasadena, of which it was once a part, and the metropolis of Los Angeles. South Pasadena is the oldest self-builder of floats in the historic Tournament of Roses Parade.

== History ==
The original inhabitants of the area were members of the Native American Hahamog-na tribe, a branch of the Tongva Nation (part of the Shoshone language group) that occupied the Los Angeles Basin. Akuvranga was the Tongva name for the area that covers modern-day South Pasadena and part of Pasadena. Tongva dwellings lined the Arroyo Seco (Los Angeles County) in South Pasadena and south to where it joins the Los Angeles River and along other natural waterways in the city. They lived in thatched, dome-shape lodges characteristic for their use of carved wood decorations. They lived on a diet of corn meal, acorns, seeds and herbs, fish, venison, berries, fruits and other small animals. They traded for ocean fish with the coastal Tongva on a daily basis. They made cooking vessels from steatite soapstone from Catalina Island. South Pasadena&#x27;s adjacency to a natural fording place along the Arroyo Seco served as a gateway to travel and commerce for aboriginal peoples. It was here that Hahamognas greeted Portola and the missionaries who later established the San Gabriel Mission a few miles to the east. The Hahamogna had a small settlement in South Pasadena that was known as “Little Hahamog-na”.

The initial buildings on the Rancho San Pascual were built on the land which eventually became the cities of Pasadena, South Pasadena and Altadena. The first of these adobe structures became headquarters for General Flores and his staff in 1847 where they agreed to surrender to American forces, ending Mexican Colonial rule in California. In 1875, the landowners of the area voted to rename their association Pasadena.

In February 1888, members of the southern portion of Pasadena attempted to gain more control over their own property and a vote for incorporation was made. In 1888, South Pasadena incorporated the southern portion of the Indiana Colony and land south and eastward to the Los Angeles border. South Pasadena&#x27;s first mayor was Donald McIntyre Graham. Few Tongva had received any land. On March 2, 1888, the city of South Pasadena was incorporated with a population slightly over 500 residents, becoming the sixth municipality in Los Angeles County. It was chartered with roughly the same area as the current South Pasadena, about . With the completion of the Pacific Electric Short Line, putting the entire city within easy walking distance of the red car stations, South Pasadena also became one of the first suburbs of Los Angeles.

=== Interstate 710 extension ===
South Pasadena, together with a broad coalition of national, state and local organizations, has opposed the 710 Freeway Long Beach Freeway (I-710) extension from Alhambra&#x27;s Valley Blvd. to the Foothill Freeway (I-210) in Pasadena at California Blvd. The proposed 1960s route would have sliced through the middle of the city, as well as through neighborhoods in El Sereno and Pasadena having an impact on nearly 1,000 homes in its path. However, this incompletion cuts off a north–south route from the San Gabriel Mountains in the north to Long Beach in the south, as well as connecting the 710 to the 110, 134, and 210 freeways.

On July 19, 1999, United States District Court Judge Pregerson issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting defendants Caltrans, et al., from proceeding with the 710 Freeway Project.
The financial support for the fight against a major highway project through the city has come mostly from the residents themselves, who pay legal bills incurred by the city in the freeway fight from their general fund (no special taxes are used), making the fight an ongoing local election issue. South Pasadena has been cited five times on the National Trust for Historic Preservation&#x27;s list of &quot;Most Endangered Places&quot;.

Litigation over the 710 extension has run for over 50 years. The City of South Pasadena has filed a federal lawsuit citing failure to protect clean air, the environment and historic properties, and until the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) completes a comprehensive new environmental study, this will bring additional delays to the 40-year-old project. Caltrans (the California Department of Transportation) proposed a compromise route of boring a tunnel beneath the city. Having purchased hundreds of properties along the proposed right-of-way in the 1960s, Caltrans proposed selling these in order to partially finance the tunnel. The Southern California real estate boom of the early 2000s caused those properties in South Pasadena alone to appreciate to a combined value of over $300 million. State Senator Carol Liu sponsored a bill to compel Caltrans to sell the properties no longer needed for the project. SB-416 also prohibits funds from the sale of surplus properties in the SR 10 corridor from being used to advance or construct any proposed North State Route 710 tunnel. State Assemblyman Chris Holden co-sponsored the bill and remarked after it was signed into law, &quot;…the surface route of the 710 Freeway is not going to happen and everyone knows that and so these properties should then be put back into the community&quot;. Caltrans, however, maintains that the freeway extension/connections are needed for the overall benefit of the Southern California public and continues to fight for its completion.

In May 2017, the MTA board voted unanimously to withdraw its support for the 710 tunnel proposal, and to reallocate all funding previously earmarked for it to surface street and other improvements, effectively killing the project for the foreseeable future. Subsequently, Assemblyman Chris Holden, along with State Senator Anthony Portantino, proposed similar bills effectively deleting the uncompleted portion from the Highway grid. Both bills were passed and signed by governor Gavin Newsom and the deletion took effect on January 1, 2024.

<text>Temple City is a city in Los Angeles County, California located northeast of downtown Los Angeles and at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains. Temple City is part of a cluster of cities, along with Pasadena, Arcadia, Alhambra, San Marino, and San Gabriel, in the west San Gabriel Valley.

== History ==
The town of Temple originated on May 30, 1923, when Walter P. Temple (June 7, 1870 – November 13, 1938) purchased of land east of San Gabriel which had been part of Lucky Baldwin&#x27;s Rancho Santa Anita. The original townsite (Tract 6561, recorded with the LA County Tax Assessor in June 1923) corresponds to the present-day area bounded by Garibaldi Avenue on the north, Baldwin Avenue on the east, Live Oak Avenue on the south, and Encinita Avenue on the west.

Temple, the son and tenth child of Pliny Fisk Temple and William Workman&#x27;s daughter Antonia Margarita Workman, was born on Rancho La Merced, which is today part of the city of Montebello. This was the site of the original San Gabriel Mission, founded by the Franciscan Fathers next to the rich bottom lands of the San Gabriel River. Historically called &quot;Rio de los Temblores&quot;, which means the River of the Earthquakes, it is today known as the Rio Hondo.

Temple envisioned building a community where average people could afford to live and own their homes. He then divided the area into lots and laid out the park facing Las Tunas Drive. He named other streets after friends and family: Workman, Kauffman, Rowland, Temple and Agnes. Bond issues initiated by Temple were responsible for street paving and electricity. Temple also petitioned the Pacific Electric Railway Company to extend its Los Angeles to Alhambra line to a depot adjacent to Temple City Park. The extension of the railway contributed to the steady growth of Temple City, and is commemorated by statues of railcar passengers along Rosemead Boulevard.

In 1925, the Women&#x27;s Club of Temple City was founded.

===City name===
The town was originally named &quot;City of Temple&quot; after its founder, Walter Temple, but the United States Postmaster General Harry Stewart New demanded a name change in 1926 because the mail was accidentally being directed to the Phoenix suburb of Tempe. It was officially designated &quot;Temple City&quot; but remained a city in name only until after the post–World War II population explosion followed by incorporation on May 25, 1960, which resulted in the redundant name: &quot;City of Temple City&quot;. (This redundancy is shared with other cities in California, such as the City of California City.) Merrill Fitzjohn, the founder and original owner of Fitzjohn Jewelers on Las Tunas Drive, was appointed as the city&#x27;s first mayor.

===2009 Temple City Affair===
In January 2009, the Los Angeles County District Attorney began investigating allegations that Temple City&#x27;s mayor, Judy Wong, along with city council members David Capra, and former mayor Cathe Wilson solicited bribes in exchange for support of the proposed $75 million Temple City Piazza mall project and both women were charged with lying on fair political practice commission disclosure forms. Randy Wang, developer of the Piazza project, made allegations that Wong, Wilson and Councilman David Capra demanded and received cash bribes for their support of the development. Wang raised the allegations as part of his counter-suit against the city, which sued him in April 2008, claiming he failed to meet contractual deadlines of construction on the Piazza project. Temple City&#x27;s lawsuit asks that the property, at Las Tunas Drive and Rosemead Boulevard, be returned to the city because of the delays after two groundbreaking ceremonies.

Wong, 55, the city&#x27;s first Asian council member, was elected in 2003, was re-elected in 2007, and served as the city&#x27;s first Asian mayor in 2007. Capra pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of failure to report a campaign contribution and agreed to resign as a condition for no prison time. Nine months after being indicted on charges of bribery and perjury, Wong resigned from office in March 2010; Wilson was voted out of office in spring 2009. In May 2010, Wong accepted a plea agreement of no contest for 10 counts of bribery and perjury. Wong served a 16-month sentence at Chowchilla after pleading no contest to 10 felony counts of bribery, solicitation of bribery and perjury, and she is required to pay $16,700 in restitution to developer Randy Wang. She will have to pay about $16,300 in fines and fees. The judge denied a request from Wong&#x27;s attorney seeking probation for the one-time politician.

Cathe Wilson was charged with three counts each of perjury and bribery. The perjury charges included one count of lying to the Los Angeles County Grand Jury in 2008 and two counts of submitting false material in Fair Political Practices reports. Although she maintains her innocence, she chose not to plea, and her case was continued. On March 30, 2011, Wilson pleaded innocent to all charges. &quot;Oh, yes, I&#x27;ve got to prove my innocence,&quot; Wilson, 78, said at the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center when asked if she was going forward with the trial. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t put my life savings … if I didn&#x27;t believe in my innocence. It&#x27;s all a crock.&quot; In May 2011 she was convicted on six felony counts. She was sentenced on June 23, 2011, to four years in state prison and to pay more than $10,000 in restitution to the developer. She was released under an Alternative Custody Program in 2013.

Former candidate Scott Carwile, Wilson&#x27;s protege, pleaded guilty to felony perjury and was granted probation in exchange for testifying against Wilson.

As of August 2014, all persons sentenced to imprisonment in the Temple City Affair have been released.

=== Attempts to block housing ===
In the aftermath of the passage of SB9, California state housing law, that permitted owners of single-family housing to subdivide their houses into duplexes, NIMBY local officials in Temple City enacted new regulations that sought to disincentivize homeowners from creating duplexes. For example, the city required a 1,000-square-foot courtyard separating housing units, as well as enacted a string of burdensome rules and regulations. As a consequence of these rules, there was not a single application for SB9 in Temple City.

California state housing officials have warned Temple City they are potentially in violation of state housing law. According to Temple City city manager Bryan Cook, the city is working in &quot;good faith&quot; with California state housing officials.

It shows famous authors, and is an &quot;interesting and unique way of showing what&#x27;s inside the library,&quot; Mortimer said. Further stating that &quot;The way they depict famous writers throughout history, the things they put in the background, such as books with wings, and their ways of showing the importance of the library in the community was very charming the way they did it.&quot;

===Camellia Festival===
History: In 1944 a contest held by the Woman&#x27;s Club of Temple City brought forth a slogan &quot;Temple City, Home of Camellias&quot;, from which stemmed the annual Camellia Festival. It was in recognition of the significance of family life that the Camellia Festival was founded. The festival, which has attracted national recognition in ensuing years, is sponsored by the City of Temple City. Its purpose is to encourage every youngster in the community to belong to one of recognized youth organizations and to participate in the affairs of their community. Only members of recognized organizations are eligible to enter the Camellia Festival Parade. The Royalty Coronation of two first graders is held the first Friday of February.

<doc id="107690" wikidata="Q489197" url="?curid=107690" title="Torrance, California">
<text>Torrance is a coastal city in the Los Angeles metropolitan area located in southwestern Los Angeles County, California, United States. The city is part of what is known as the South Bay region of the metropolitan area. A small section of the city, , abuts the Pacific Ocean. Torrance has a moderate year-round climate with average rainfall of per year. Torrance was incorporated in 1921, and at the 2020 census had a population of 147,067 residents. Torrance has a beachfront and has 30 parks located around the city. It is also the birthplace of the American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO).

==History==
=== Pre-colonial era ===
For thousands of years, the area of Torrance was occupied by the Tongva Native Americans. The land that is now part of the City of Torrance and much of the modern South Bay was part of the extensive marshlands.

=== Spanish and Mexican eras ===
In 1784, the Spanish Crown deeded Rancho San Pedro (including present-day Torrance), a tract of over in the province of Las Californias of New Spain, to soldier Juan José Domínguez. It was later divided in 1846, with Governor Pío Pico granting Rancho de los Palos Verdes to José Loreto and Juan Capistrano Sepulveda in the Alta California territory of independent Mexico.

=== Modern Era ===
In the early 1900s, real estate developer Jared Sidney Torrance and other investors saw the value of creating a mixed industrial–residential community south of Los Angeles. They purchased part of an old Spanish land grant and hired landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. to design a planned community. The resulting town was founded in October 1912 and named after Torrance. The city of Torrance was formally incorporated in May 1921, the townsite initially being bounded by Western Avenue on the east, Del Amo Boulevard on the north, Crenshaw Boulevard on the west, and on the south by Plaza del Amo east of where it meets Carson Street, and by Carson Street west of where it meets Plaza del Amo.

The first residential avenue created in Torrance was Gramercy and the second avenue was Andreo. Many of the houses on these avenues reached the centennial mark in 2012. Both avenues are located in the area referred to as Old Torrance. This section of Torrance is under review to be classified as a historical district. Some of the early civic and residential buildings were designed by the renowned and innovative Southern California architect Irving Gill, in his distinctive combining of Mission Revival and early Modernist architecture.

==== Historic Olmstead District ====
Torrance was planned as a new prototype of a balanced industrial city based on the principles of the Garden City Movement. The original tract developed by the Olmstead Brothers consists of 109 city blocks divided into three sub-districts: residential, commercial, and industrial. The plan is most notable for its axial landscaped downtown commercial neighborhood aligned to have a view of Mount San Antonio in the San Gabriel Mountains. The Olmsted Tract includes a number of buildings designed by the noted Southern California Architect Irving Gill, including the original train depot.

The footprint of the downtown neighborhood, now called Old Torrance, was designed on a diagonal to allow the trade breezes coming from the Pacific Ocean to keep the air clean from industrial pollution for the residential and commercial neighborhoods. The industrial sections of the city were placed on the eastern side of the original tract.

Public transportation played a key role in the founding of Torrance. The Pacific Electric Red Car connected downtown Los Angeles to the new development of downtown Torrance. Designed in 1912 by Irving Gill, the terminus depot of the Red Car line was designed in a Spanish revival style popularized during this era. In May 1913, the Pacific Electric Railroad Bridge was built. Often called the &quot;El Prado Bridge&quot;, it further expanded the industrial heart of the South Bay. The concrete double-tracked arch bridge was the Pacific Electric Railway&#x27;s first interurban line that connected north–south to San Pedro via the Gardena Line. The bridge was used for transporting freight and commuting workers to Torrance factories. The Red Car line connected under the bridge as it connected to the train depot located on Cabrillo Avenue. The bridge no longer carries any rail cars, with Pacific Electric closing the Red Car line to Torrance in the 1940s. The bridge became the city of Torrance&#x27;s second entry in the National Register of Historic Places on July 13, 1989, and is used as a logo for the city&#x27;s new wayfinding signage and city materials.

==Geography==
Torrance is a coastal community in southwestern Los Angeles County sharing the climate and geographical features common to the Greater Los Angeles area. Its boundaries are: Redondo Beach Boulevard and the cities of Lawndale and Gardena to the north; Western Avenue and the Harbor Gateway neighborhood of Los Angeles to the east; the Palos Verdes Hills with the cities of Lomita, Rolling Hills Estates and Palos Verdes Estates on the south; and the Pacific Ocean and the city of Redondo Beach to the west.

The western portion of Torrance is in ZIP Code 90277 which is a city of Redondo Beach postal address. It is about southwest of Downtown Los Angeles.

Torrance Beach lies between Redondo Beach and Malaga Cove on Santa Monica Bay. The southernmost stretch of Torrance Beach, on a cove at the northern end of the Palos Verdes peninsula, is known to locals as Rat Beach (Right After Torrance).

An urban wetland, the Madrona Marsh is a nature preserve on land once set for oil production and saved from development, with restoration projects enhancing the vital habitat for birds, wildlife, and native plants.

=== Climate ===
Torrance has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;), bordering with a semi-arid climate (&quot;Bsk&quot;). The rainy season is November through March, as shown in the adjacent table. Summers tend to be warm but dry, despite Torrance&#x27;s proximity to the coast. The Sunset Western Garden Book places most of Torrance in Zone 22, part of a basin area in Greater Los Angeles where cold air can pool -- hence the surprisingly chilly record low temperatures for each calendar month at the airport, which has risk of frost over six months. Milder microclimates are found upslope of the airport to the south (Zone 23 -- thermal belt) and in the western blocks bordering the beach communities and Palos Verdes Estates (Zone 24 -- marine influence dominant).

===Japanese Americans===

In the pre-World War II period, the South Bay region was one of the few areas that allowed non-U.S. citizens to acquire property, so a Japanese presence came. According to John Kaji, a Torrance resident quoted in Public Radio International who was the son of Toyota&#x27;s first American-based accountant, the Japanese corporate presence in Torrance, beginning with Toyota, attracted many ethnic Japanese. Toyota moved its operations to its Torrance campus in 1982 because of its proximity to the Port of Long Beach and Los Angeles International Airport, and many other Japanese companies followed suit.

<text>Val Verde () (Spanish for &quot;Green Valley&quot;) is an unincorporated community in the southeastern Topatopa Mountains foothills, and in northwestern Los Angeles County, California. The unincorporated community of Valencia (Newhall Ranch) is southeast, and the city of Santa Clarita is east of the community. Its population was 2,468 at the 2010 census, up from 1,472 at the 2000 census. For statistical purposes the Census Bureau has defined Val Verde as a census-designated place (CDP).

==Geography==
Val Verde is located in the San Martinez Chiquito Canyon in the southeastern foothills of the Topatopa Mountains at an elevation ranging from . The canyon contains a creek with runs intermittently through the community. It is about northwest of the county seat in downtown Los Angeles and west of the community of Valencia and city of Santa Clarita.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP boundary has a total area of , all of it land.

=== Vegetation ===
The area is a coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitat. The area is surrounded by mature trees, including native Coast Live Oaks and California Sycamores, as well as introduced trees that were planted in Val Verde Park like River She-Oak, Deodar Cedar, Silk Oak, and Ash.

==History==
The area of modern-day Val Verde was part of the territory of the Tataviam people who had migrated to the region before the mid-5th century AD. One of the nearest settlements to the Val Verde area was called Chaguibit, located to the east of the confluence of the Santa Clara River and Castaic Creek.

=== Spanish and Mexican era ===
Spanish colonization of the region began in the late 1700s. With the establishment of the San Fernando Rey de España Mission in 1797, the native populations around this mission, named &quot;fernandeños&quot; by the Spanish, were relocated from their ancestral settlements, referred to as &quot;rancherías&quot;, to the mission where they were coerced into conversion and forced labor with the purpose of Christianization and assimilation. By 1810, nearly the entire Tataviam population had been displaced to the mission lands and baptized under the Spanish mission system. In 1804, the Santa Clarita Valley began to be used by the Spanish when the missionaries established the San Francisco Xavier Estancia near the Santa Clara and Castaic confluence to supplement agricultural and livestock production for the San Fernando Mission using native labor.

Following the independence of Mexico, the missions went through a process of secularization and mission lands were inventoried and sold off by the government as &quot;ranchos&quot;; the lands were supposed to be returned to the natives who had belonged to the missions, but this principle was not followed. The former estancia lands were sold as Rancho San Francisco by California governor Juan Bautista Alvarado to his friend lieutenant Antonio del Valle on January 22, 1839. The northern boundaries of this rancho ran along the north bank of the Santa Clara River up to an area near the current intersection of Chiquito Canyon Road and Henry Mayo Drive and up along the mountains east of Val Verde.

In 1842 Francisco López, a relative of Del Valle, found gold in Placerita Canyon, leading to a small local gold rush in which Mexican settlers, many of them from Sonora, came to the rancho to mine gold. The original settlement of Val Verde was a short-lived boom town built by colonial Mexican settlers. During the Mexican–American War, Del Valle destroyed the mine to prevent the United States from gaining its control.

The rancho stayed in the Del Valle family through the occupation and annexation of Alta California by the United States until 1862 when economic strife caused by floods and droughts forced him to sell most of the land to speculators, eventually ending up in the hands of Henry Newhall.

=== Val Verde Ranch ===
By the early 1900s, the Janes family owned the where the modern settlement is located. Laura C. Janes, a wealthy white woman from Pasadena, opened her ranch to African Americans in the 1910s in response to the discrimination they faced which excluded them from public recreational facilities and prevented them from owning and developing property in certain areas. Under these conditions of segregation and discrimination, a group of prominent members of the African American community in Los Angeles searched for locations to create a place of recreation for their families. The group was led by real estate entrepreneur Sidney Preston Dones and other investors like Norman O. Houston, Charlotta Bass, and Hattie S. Baldwin. The group ended up connecting with Laura C. Janes.

=== Eureka Villa and Val Verde ===
In 1924, the modern settlement was founded by Sidney P. Dones and his group of investors. It was named Eureka Villa. That settlement was designed as a resort community for African Americans, as in that period, African Americans were frequently barred from public beaches and swimming pools. The town became known as the &quot;Black Palm Springs&quot;. By the 1930s, the area was wildly popular, mainly because it was one of only a few places blacks could go for recreation.

Other Southern California destinations included Lake Elsinore reservoir in Riverside County, a section of Venice Beach, Bruce&#x27;s Beach in the South Bay, and a park in Pasadena only open to blacks one day a year.

Two land tracts were being sold, one was the Eureka Villa Tract and the other was the Val Verde Tract. Eureka Villa was the land running north-south along the east side of Chiquito Canyon Road while Val Verde covered the east-west area of land. Newspaper promotions focused on Black Angelenos and encouraged them to invest in these properties to build vacation homes. and larger sites were offered starting at $75, including the full deed and title and a paid lifetime membership to the community club. Eventually, Dones and his group along with Janes discontinued their management of sales for the Val Verde Tract, focusing only on Eureka Villa and Harry M. Waterman, another white landowner who was instrumental in the development and management of the lots, took charge of Val Verde.

In 1927, a was donated to the county by white landowners led by Harry M. Waterman which later became Val Verde Park. By this time, the area was known simply as &quot;Val Verde&quot; and Waterman continued to be an important developer of the community. Cafés, restaurants, and nightclubs were opened along with motels, lodges, and campgrounds. Entertainers like Ella Fitzgerald and Lena Horne made appearances in the town.

By 1939, prices for the lots ranged from $99 to $400 and more than fifty homes had been built. The park continued to be the site of gatherings. In 1939, the cornerstone for the Olympic swimming pool was laid in a ceremony attended by the community and thousands of others and presided over by actress Hattie McDaniel. The 1994 Northridge earthquake damaged the original pool. Advertising for the area continued in the 1940s. Leon Perdue began to serve as Val Verde Park&#x27;s director in 1942, becoming the first African American to have this permanent position for the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation. Perdue worked with the Chamber of Commerce to orchestrate various programs including the Bathing Beauty Pageant, the Musclemen Shows, Fourth of July Dances, Christmas programs among others. In 1945 William S. Hart High School was built and students no longer had to travel to San Fernando High School. Elementary school-aged kids traveled to Castaic Elementary.

In the 1950s and 60s, the main employers in the community were Thatcher Glass in Saugus, Burmite Powder Company, and Kaiser Manufacturing. African Americans continued to compose the majority of the population in the 50s. A Baptist church opened in 1953 which is now the Castaic Community African Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1951, the Val Verde Improvement Association initiated a water and lighting district to improve the poor water supply system in the community.

The Val Verde Chamber of Commerce appointed Marguerite Carr as president in 1960 after James Barksdale resigned due to declining health. She had promoted the park&#x27;s first &quot;Goodwill Relationship Day&quot; to bring together members of different racial groups in the area starting in 1952. She was instrumental in the establishment of a post office branch in the community in June 1956.

Despite the community having been built as a safe-haven for African Americans, residents still faced difficulties. In 1964, a home owned by Frank D. Godden, an African American World War II veteran and community developer, was burned down by members of the Klan who had a &quot;nucleus&quot; in the area at that time.

=== Post-1960s ===
With the advent of civil-rights reforms in the 1960s and the unenforceability of racial covenants, many African Americans moved out of the area for larger areas from which they were previously segregated. Farm workers from nearby agricultural areas began to move to the area. The town now has a large percentage of Latinos and Whites.

By the 1970&#x27;s the population was nearing 500. In 1973, 126 new homes were built. In November 1971, the California Institute of the Arts established their Valencia campus and instructors and alumni moved to the area. In the 1980s, the total population had risen to between 600 and 1,000 people with 10% to 15% being white. The area began to decline as vacation homes that weren&#x27;t intended to be permanent became dilapidated. In 1980, city officials reported that half of the houses were deemed sub-standard. Many of the dwellings were rented out.

In the early 1990s the Chiquita Canyon Landfill, which had been constructed near the community in 1971, faced resistance as its expansion was sought. As part of negotiations, the landfill provides the community with funds for scholarship programs.

The 1994 Northridge earthquake wreaked tremendous havoc on the town, damaging most of the original structures. The original pool was damaged and has since been repaired and shortened. The pool is part of the Los Angeles County Park system. It opens late spring until early fall. Day and evening swimming sessions occur daily.

In 2011, Verizon Wireless attempted to build a 30,000 watt, 12-panel antenna array cell site in Val Verde, less than from an adjacent residence. Verizon Wireless and its contractor claimed that the main reason for the cell site was for community of Val Verde, but inquiries were made and the cell site is designed to fill coverage holes in the adjacent Valencia Commerce Center industrial park, Hasley Hills housing tract, and for future developments outside of Val Verde. Local residents banded together and protested the cell site, claiming that big business was trying to run rampant over the little community of Val Verde. As of early 2013, Verizon Wireless has not built the cell tower, and has decided to build the tower on a hillside away from homes.

On May 16, 2017, the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department seized 7,000 cockfighting birds at a ranch on Jackson Street in Val Verde. Although 2,700 birds had been seized from the same location in 2007, the 2017 raid was the &quot;largest cockfighting bust in U.S. history&quot; according to &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, while the sheriff department said it was, &quot;one of the largest seizures of flying fowl used for illegal cockfighting and (for) breeding for illegal cockfighting purposes.&quot; The owner was not arrested.

<text>Vernon is a city south of downtown Los Angeles, California, the nearest separate city to downtown Los Angeles. The population was 112 at the 2010 United States Census, the least of any incorporated city in the state. Its population nearly doubled to 222 by the 2020 census, making it the least populous city in Southern California, and the second least populous city in the state, after Amador City.

The city is primarily composed of industrial areas and touts itself as &quot;exclusively industrial&quot;. Meatpacking plants and warehouses are common. As of 2006, there were no parks in the city.

== History ==
Vernon is the site of the Battle of La Mesa on January 9, 1847, when General Stephen W. Kearny again defeated General José María Flores the day after the Battle of Río San Gabriel. Accepting defeat, General Flores fled southeast to Sonora, while Major Pico headed north into the San Gabriel Mountains with a hundred Californios. This ended hostilities in Alta California during the Mexican–American War of 1846–1848. By the dawn of the 20th century, it was a stretch of unincorporated grassland near Los Angeles&#x27; flourishing downtown.

In 1905, Vernon was incorporated by ranchers James J. and Thomas J. Furlong and John B. Leonis, a merchant. Vernon was incorporated to promote industrial development along the railroads in the area. John Leonis, of Basque origin, had come to Southern California in 1880 to work for his uncle, Miguel Leonis, and later established his own ranch on unincorporated county land southeast of downtown Los Angeles. Recognizing the importance of the three major railroads running through the area, he persuaded railroad executives to run spur tracks off the main lines and incorporated the adjacent as the first &quot;exclusively industrial&quot; city in the southwestern United States. He named the new city after a dirt road, Vernon Avenue, that crossed its center.

In 1907, on land leased from Leonis, the founders of the city marketed Vernon as a &quot;sporting town&quot;. The Vernon Arena was known for its 20-round boxing matches. Shortly thereafter, the Pacific Coast League built a baseball park. The Vernon Tigers, a minor league baseball team in the Pacific Coast League, played from 1909 through 1925. The team won back-to-back PCL pennants in 1919 and 1920. The ballpark also housed two 1910 Southern California Trolley League teams, the Los Angeles Maiers and the Los Angeles McCormicks.

Leonis created an enticing attraction, leasing property to the founders of the city, for a baseball stadium, a 7,000-seat boxing arena, and the &quot;world&#x27;s longest bar&quot;, 100 feet long with thirty-seven bartenders. The Vernon Country Club was a popular night spot for young Hollywood for a time, especially during a brief window before national prohibition was instituted where Los Angeles was &quot;dry&quot; but Vernon still permitted the sale of alcohol. As industrialists from the East Coast traveled to Vernon for heavyweight matches, Leonis sold many of them on locating their West Coast factories in Vernon. By the 1930s, Owens-Illinois and Alcoa had facilities there, purchasing subsidized electricity from the new utility Vernon Light &amp; Power.

While some land adjacent to the original incorporated area was excluded from the city in 1910 and 1924, land to the east and south was incorporated in 1914, 1920, 1925, 1926 and 1928. The most important of these was that of 1925, when almost 800 acres of the Central Manufacturing District, which was already built up with 28 industrial plants, adding an assessed valuation of $8 million to the city&#x27;s resources. This annexation was voted up unanimously by Mr &amp; Mrs A. J. Olsen, of 4318 S. Downey Road, the only two legal voters in the district. Such selective annexations ensured industrial areas were brought within the city, while residential areas were excluded.

The Studebaker factory was built in 1938 at 4530 Loma Vista Avenue. It was the company&#x27;s only West Coast factory, producing 64 cars a day. It was closed in 1956, and ten years later in 1966, Studebaker folded. It is now the location of St. Regis Paper.

Following Leonis&#x27; death in 1953, he left behind an estate reportedly worth $8 million, as well as several parcels of land, to his grandson Leonis. Leonis Malburg first won a council seat in 1956 and was elected mayor in 1974. &quot;Vernon has long been dogged by accusations that it is a fiefdom run by a family that has held sway over the town for generations.&quot;

The Poxon China Company was founded by George Wade Poxon (b. 1887, Castle Donington, Leicestershire, England) and his wife Judith (née Furlong), who in 1913 were married at St. Martha&#x27;s Church in Vernon. The church had been built by the Furlong family in 1913. George Wade Poxon, a cousin of George Albert Wade (later Colonel Sir George Albert Wade), was well known as the chairman of Wade Potteries Limited in England, which produced &quot;Wade Whimsies&quot;. George Wade (b. about 1863 Tunstall, Staffordshire, father to George Albert Wade and uncle to George Wade Poxon) owned a pottery in Burslem, Staffordshire, England. The Wade family had been associated with the pottery industry for many years. George Wade Poxon was a member of the Royal Science Academy. At the age of 24, in 1911, he emigrated to the United States. The kilns were located on the Furlong ranch.

Vernon Kilns was founded in July 1931 after Faye G. Bennison purchased the Poxon China Company in Vernon. The Poxon China Company had its headquarters on 52nd Street, which is now part of Los Angeles. Bennison continued to produce Poxon lines, using Poxon shapes until an earthquake in 1933 forced Bennison to develop new and original shapes for the company. Two fires in the late 1940s almost destroyed Vernon Potteries, Ltd., but Bennison rebuilt and the company continued to thrive. The company was not able to compete when foreign imports flooded the US. In 1958 Vernon Kilns sold all its holdings to Metlox. Metlox continued to market some Vernon shapes and patterns under the division Vernonware until 1989. The company produced dinnerware, art pottery, figurines, ashtrays and other popular items. All products were of earthenware, with clays from Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, and England. Glazes were developed from minerals mined in California, and many patterns, including all of the plaids, were hand painted.
Vernon returned to being exclusively industrial around 1919. Two giant stockyards were opened and meat packing quickly became the city&#x27;s main industry. Twenty-seven slaughterhouses and the Los Angeles Union Stock Yards eventually lined Vernon Avenue from Soto Street to Downey Road until the late 1960s.

The 1940s and 1950s added aerospace contractors Norris Industries, box and paper manufacturers, drug companies such as Brunswig, and food processors General Mills and Kal Kan. Giant meat packers Farmer John and Swift flourished.

In 1932, after a dispute with Southern California Edison over industrial rates for electricity, John Leonis sponsored a bond measure to authorize the building of a city-owned power plant, which is still operational today, providing the city with its notably lower utility rate.

=== Elections of 2006 ===
The city held no contested or meaningfully competitive elections from 1980 to 2006. Out of five city council members serving in 2006, only one had been chosen by the voters, the other four having been appointed to their positions by city officials.

Most of the city&#x27;s fewer than 90 voters are city employees or connected to city employees who live in homes rented at a nominal fee. In 1979 a firefighter tried to run for mayor and was immediately evicted and told he couldn&#x27;t run.

In 2006, a few people moved into Vernon and ran for city council, the first time in more than two decades that there was a competitive race for city council. Eight people converted a 1950s-era office building into a five-room apartment (the building had previously been used as a tanning facility turning sheepskin into billiard/pool pockets), and three of them filed to run for office. In response, the city turned off their power and attempted to evict them as illegal squatters. The City of Vernon alleged that the men were part of a hostile takeover attempt by convicted felon Albert T. Robles, who nearly bankrupted the nearby city of South Gate as treasurer, and Eduardo Olivo, a former Vernon attorney who also worked with Albert T. Robles in South Gate. The city tried to cancel their registrations but was ordered to allow them to run and to count the ballots.

On June 30, California Secretary of State Bruce McPherson called on the city to count the votes and expressed his support for the state to take over the responsibility of conducting the city&#x27;s elections. During the trial it was alleged that all three of the newcomer candidates had direct ties to Albert T. Robles: Alejandro Lopez is a first cousin, David Johnson Jr. is the brother-in-law of a business partner, and Don A. Huff is associated through Eduardo Olivo. In March 2006, Judge David P. Yaffe ruled that the city could not prohibit legally registered voters who reside within its boundaries from running for city council. The city had to be ordered to allow the election to proceed. An election was held under a court order on April 11, 2006. But the city clerk, Bruce Malkenhorst Jr., refused to count the ballots until the legal disputes were resolved, and temporarily ordered the ballots to be sealed. In August 2006, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Aurelio Munoz ruled that the newcomers received free rent and jobs prior to registering to vote and that they were involved in a scheme orchestrated by Albert T. Robles and Eduardo Olivo to &quot;steal&quot; the election, but that such actions were not illegal. On October 16, 2006, it was announced that city officials were ready to count the votes from the contested April 11 election. The officials failed to prove their claim of voter fraud. A judge granted Vernon&#x27;s motion to count the votes. The challengers lost by a landslide.

=== Corruption ===
==== Corruption charges ====
On November 15, 2006, the investigation into alleged public corruption in Vernon resulted in charges against the city&#x27;s mayor, Leonis Malburg, as well as his wife, his son, and the former city administrator. The Los Angeles District Attorney&#x27;s office had launched an investigation in April 2005 upon allegations that the city&#x27;s former administrator, Bruce Malkenhorst Sr., had misappropriated public funds for personal use.

Their investigation uncovered evidence of voter fraud on the part of the ruling family, which, it was asserted, tried to keep out new residents. Leonis Malburg, who has been mayor for 50 years, claimed he lived in a small Vernon apartment in the 2800 block of Leonis Boulevard (named after his grandfather, also a mayor), when in fact he was living in upscale Hancock Park, Los Angeles. His wife and son also claimed to live in Vernon, voting in Vernon elections although evidence indicated they too lived in Hancock Park. Charges against the Malburgs included voter fraud, assisting unqualified voters, false registration, and perjury.

Malkenhorst Sr. was charged with 18 counts of &quot;misappropriation of public funds&quot; for reportedly taking $60,000 of city money for personal use. His salary from the city had been $600,000. Malkenhorst at one time collected a pension of $499,674.84. In 2010, Malkenhorst received a reported $510,000 annual pension, plus health benefits, as former city administrator, the most of any of the 9,111 retired California government workers receiving pensions from CalPERS. Malkenhorst retired in 2005.

==== Corruption and disincorporation campaign ====
&quot;With longstanding political woes, Vernon faced allegations of corruption similar to those in nearby cities such as the City of Bell. Although Vernon and Bell share a border in Southeast Los Angeles County, they are very different cities. Bell is a working-class, largely immigrant city with 38,000 residents. Vernon has fewer than 100 residents and is largely a business and industrial hub.&quot;

==== Corruption allegations ====
Expanding legal action against excessive salaries and pensions in two southeast Los Angeles County cities, then-Attorney General Jerry Brown had subpoenaed testimony from the City of Vernon. Brown&#x27;s subpoena sought testimony under oath from Vernon officials about compensation and pension benefits for six highly paid city officials, one of whom received more than $1.6 million in a single year from the city.

According to media reports and other sources, former Vernon city administrator Eric T. Fresch was paid $1.65 million in 2008. In 2009 O&#x27;Callaghan was paid $785,000, Burnett, $570,000, and Harrison, $800,000. Malkenhorst Jr. was paid $290,000 in 2008. Malkenhorst Sr., who also has been charged with misappropriation of public funds, retired in 2005, and as a former employee, still receives a pension that is the highest in the state of California. Malkenhorst Sr. has been convicted of fraud and is under investigation for several other charges. Malkenhorst pleaded guilty in May 2011 to illegally using public money to pay for personal items. Prosecutors said that from 2000 to 2005, he was illegally reimbursed for personal expenses that included meals, golfing, massages, a personal trainer, and a home security system. He received three years&#x27; probation and was fined $35,000, including penalties. He was ordered to repay $60,000 in restitution. He was fined $10,000 in addition to other penalties. His total of $105,000 in fines will be no problem for Malkenhurst, who continues to receive the highest public pension in California: $509,664. &quot;The law states that pensions are revoked if an elected official is convicted of a felony, but not in the case of an employee,&quot; said Brad Pacheco, a spokesman for CalPERS. Malkenhorst &quot;would continue to receive his pension according to the law.&quot;

In September 2010, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that the inquiry followed the newspaper&#x27;s report that Donal O&#x27;Callaghan, then city administrator, received $243,898 in consulting payments through June 2010, through Tara Energy, Inc., the company run by his wife, Kimberly McBride. The payments were in addition to O&#x27;Callaghan&#x27;s yearly salary of $380,000. He was accused of corruption for his role in obtaining city jobs for his wife. O&#x27;Callaghan was indicted by a Los Angeles grand jury on three felony counts of conflict of interest and misappropriation of public funds. He pleaded not guilty to two felony counts of conflict of interest involving contracts and one of public officer crime.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Eric Fresch, who now serves as a legal consultant, has been paid over $1 million for the last four years. He was paid almost $1.65 million in salary and hourly billings in 2008, when he was serving as both city administrator and deputy city attorney. Others in Vernon received $570,000 to $800,000 in 2009. Former City Attorney Jeffrey A. Harrison earned $800,000 in 2009, and City Treasurer/Finance Director Roirdan Burnett made $570,000. In 2008, Harrison was paid $1.04 million.

In 2010, Malburg, the former mayor for fifty years, was ordered to pay more than $500,000 after being found guilty of fraud. Prosecutors stated he claimed to live in Vernon but actually had a home in the wealthy Hancock Park area of Los Angeles. Leonis Malburg and his wife, Dominica, were convicted of voter fraud and other charges.

State Senator Tony Strickland (R-Moorpark) proposed a bill that would divest the pensions of any public official convicted of abusing public funds. The bill, SB115, was killed in a state Senate committee. The bill drew the ire of several employee groups, including the AFL–CIO, the California Professional Firefighters, and the California State Employees Association. These groups and the lawmakers who voted against the bill contended that &quot;it discriminated against public employees relative to private employees and said such a law would really harm the innocent spouse and family of the convicted officer, who will lose their financial security.&quot; Strickland stated he was &quot;shocked&quot; that the bill was killed. &quot;State law affects judges and elected officials, but not people like Rizzo,&quot; he said. &quot;The argument about the family is a weak argument that can apply to any person convicted of a crime. Families are always affected when you talk about criminals.&quot;

=== Disincorporation legislation ===
Vernon has dealt with the idea of disincorporation after city government corruption was discovered. In 2011, legislation was being considered to move to disincorporate the city. If this had taken effect, Vernon would be the third incorporated place in California to be disbanded in the past forty years, after Cabazon in 1972 and Hornitos in 1973. California State Assemblyman John Pérez submitted a bill to the California legislature which would have disincorporated Vernon as a city. The allegations of rampant corruption prompted the state Assembly to approve Pérez&#x27;s proposed legislation, AB46, to disincorporate cities with fewer than 150 residents. Vernon is the only city that would have been affected by the bill.

According to an editorial in the April 26, 2011, edition of the &quot;Long Beach Press-Telegram,&quot; support to maintain Vernon&#x27;s city status came from two powerful groups that were rarely allied: The business community (including the California, Los Angeles, and Vernon chambers of commerce) and the labor community (including the Los Angeles Federation of Labor and the Teamsters) joined in the battle against Sacramento. Both groups acknowledged that Vernon needed a comprehensive political housecleaning, but both maintained its right to cityhood. Gloria Molina, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, which has voted in support of disincorporating Vernon, stated: It is a &quot;company town masquerading as a city.&quot; &quot;The city has been a facade for some personal gain issues. The residents are employees of the city or major companies and consequently are controlled.&quot; If the bill becomes law, Los Angeles County could and most certainly would absorb Vernon.

The bill had passed in the Assembly on a bipartisan vote of 58–7.

In the last few weeks of the legislative session of summer 2011, a team of attorneys and lobbyists from Vernon were trying to kill the bill that would disincorporate the city when state Senator Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles) came to them with a creative and unconventional offer. De Leon, who had earlier supported disbanding Vernon, said he would help to defeat the legislation if Vernon would accept a proposed list of government reforms and set aside $60 million in order to fund community projects in the small, working-class cities that surround Vernon. Vernon agreed to the offer, and de Leon then proceeded to support the groups fighting disincorporation. City officials in nearby Huntington Park, which stood to receive some of Vernon&#x27;s grant money, also reversed their support to the City of Vernon. On August 29, the state Senate rejected the bill to disband Vernon.

The Vernon City Council unanimously passed salary limits and other wide-ranging reforms on May 26, 2011, as the tiny Los Angeles suburb fought efforts to eliminate its cityhood. The council approved an amended package that cut the salaries of council members from $70,000 to $25,000 a year, but not beginning until the end of their current terms. Other officials, including the police chief, also saw their salaries trimmed. Department heads&#x27; salaries were capped at $267,000. Previously, some city officials allegedly made more than $1 million to govern the city. The council also authorized benefit reductions for officials, established a city housing commission, and voted to place a proposal on the city ballot that would change the city charter and limit council members to two, five-year terms. The city owns nearly all residential housing in town and there had been concerns that its officials were &quot;de facto&quot; landlords of the voters.

The reforms took the city of Vernon further toward a more open, transparent and inclusive governance structure,&quot; MacFarlane said. &quot;The business community will have a role to play, as will representatives of labor, and those are two key constituencies.&quot; On August 2, 2011, former state attorney general John Van de Kamp, hired by the city to do an independent review of its policies, released a report that found &quot;no significant fault&quot; in Vernon&#x27;s compliance with the Political Reform Act, conflict of interest policies, the Brown Act, or the Public Records Act.

=== Transparency and progress ===
In an effort to modernize the city and stave off the potential threat of disincorporation in the future, for the first time in the city&#x27;s history Vernon opened its doors to new residents from the general public. In 2015, Vernon&#x27;s population nearly doubled with the opening of Vernon Village Park Apartments on E. 52nd Drive and King Avenue, the majority of which were made available to the public and not exclusively to those affiliated with Vernon industry and city government, as had been the case for most of the city&#x27;s history. In effect, this means that the democratic process in Vernon can no longer be a carefully managed internal affair used to keep already influential individuals in power, a major adjustment in its own right.

Facing significant revenue shortfalls, in 2017 the Vernon city government proposed &quot;Measure Q&quot; to voters, which would have generated additional revenue to fund the government via a tax increase on electricity generated and sold by the city to residents and industries. Vernon residents rejected the tax increase by a margin of nine votes, with 23 voting no, and only 14 voting in favor of the utility tax increase.

Vernon&#x27;s City Council is composed of five members, each elected to a five-year term according to the city&#x27;s charter. Voters elect one City Council member during the city&#x27;s April municipal elections, which take place on a second Tuesday. Vernon is one of the cities opposed to California&#x27;s Senate Bill 415, which prohibits stand-alone elections for city councils, K–12 public schools, community colleges, and special districts, consolidating them with even-year county, state, and federal primary and general elections.

== Economy ==
Consisting almost entirely of warehouses and factories, the city&#x27;s main industries are food service manufacturing, metalworking, and manufacture of glass and plastic equipment. Housing is owned by the city and its few residents are employed within the city limits. There are approximately 46,000 direct and 54,000 indirect mostly skilled workers employed by business within the City of Vernon. Food companies in Vernon include Bon Appetit Bakery, Papa Cantella&#x27;s Sausages Company, Core-Mark, F. Gaviña &amp; Sons Inc, Newport Meat, J &amp; J Snack Foods, Overhill Farms, Pacific American Fish Company, Red Chamber Co., and Tapatío Foods. Apparel companies in Vernon include 7 for All Mankind, BCBG Max Azria, Lucky Brand Jeans, and True Religion. The city is also home to rendering plants, smelters and metalworking companies. Vernon has a $4.5 billion private employer payroll.

Vernon is primarily industrial, with very few residents, and so has several singular city services. Vernon is one of 57 jurisdictions in the United States with a Class 1-rated fire department and one of four cities in California with its own health department that specializes in industrial issues. It has a police force, municipally owned housing for city employees, and a light and power department with rates that were, once, up to 40% lower than those of Southern California Edison and Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. These services are designed for industry. In 1989, Vernon formed a redevelopment agency, which has since invested millions of dollars to develop property within the city to successfully attract and retain business.

In 2008, the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation named Vernon Los Angeles County&#x27;s &quot;Most Business Friendly City&quot; among cities with less than 50,000 residents. Vernon produces a $250,000,000 flow of revenue every year, much of it from city-owned utilities.

Lead contamination from the Exide battery recycling plant in Vernon has impacted residents in nearby communities. In March 2015, the facility was permanently shut down by California regulators due to decades-long arsenic and lead leakage and emissions that are expected to require extensive cleanup efforts.

Vernon is also home to the Derby Dolls, a roller derby league that competes regularly.

<text>View Park−Windsor Hills is an unincorporated community in Los Angeles County, California. The View Park neighborhood is the community surrounding Angeles Vista Boulevard and the Windsor Hills neighborhood is on the southern end to the north of Slauson Avenue.

<text>Walnut is a city in the eastern part of Los Angeles County in the U.S. state of California. According to the 2010 census, the city had a population of 29,172, and the population was estimated to be 29,685 in 2019.

The greater Walnut Valley is located between the steep San Jose Hills to the north and the gently sloping Puente Hills to the south. Quality housing consists of master-planned single family homes ranging in size from . The city hosts a highly ranked public school system: the Walnut Valley Unified School District, which has been ranked by numerous sources as one of the top public school districts in Southern California, as well as Mt. San Antonio College.

The city covers nearly and is home to hundreds of businesses. According to the 2010 United States Census, Walnut has a median household income at one of the top-earning percentiles in the country at $101,250.

The city&#x27;s name is derived from the Rancho Los Nogales Mexican land grant, &quot;nogales&quot; being the Spanish word for &quot;walnut trees&quot;; the native California black walnut is a common tree, native to the San Jose Hills. The City of Walnut is a general law city incorporated on January 19, 1959. It is governed by a city council/city manager form of government. A five-member city council is elected by the residents, and a mayor is elected annually by the council to serve a twelve-month term. A city manager is appointed by the council to oversee the daily activities of the city.

==Geography==
Walnut is located on the southern slopes of the San Jose Hills, with West Covina to the northwest, Covina to the north, San Dimas to the northeast, Pomona to the east, Diamond Bar, Rowland Heights, and the City of Industry to the south, and La Puente to the west. Several small creeks (i.e. Snow Creek, Lemon Creek) run mostly to the south toward the valley of San Jose Creek, which runs west to the San Gabriel River.

===Climate===
==History==

The area are the traditional lands of the Tongva people. Spanish missionaries who arrived in the 18th century called the indigenes &quot;Gabrieleño&quot;, because the area where they lived was controlled by the San Gabriel Mission. The Walnut area was part of the network of outlying ranches used for the grazing of cattle and sheep by the Mission.

Following secularization of the missions in the 1830s, former mission lands were divided into &quot;ranchos&quot;, and given away as land grants by the Mexican government of Alta California. In the Walnut area, the first grants were Rancho San Jose (granted to Ricardo Vejar and Ygnacio Palomares in 1837); Rancho Los Nogales (granted to Jose De La Cruz Linares in 1840); and Rancho La Puente (granted to John Rowland and William Workman in 1842). In 1868, John Rowland and William Workman divided Rancho La Puente, leaving Rowland the eastern half and Workman the western half. Rowland&#x27;s land included the western portion of Walnut and the adjacent community now called Rowland Heights. The land was used mainly for raising cattle and growing wheat, grapes, and fruit trees (mostly citrus).

In 1895, the first U.S. post office was established and given the name &quot;Lemon&quot;. In 1908, the post office name was changed to Walnut. As a reminder of those early days, the U.S. Post Office is on Lemon Avenue, one of the town&#x27;s main streets.

The City of Walnut&#x27;s Bicentennial Commission selected the construction of Lemon Creek Park and the restoration of the William R. Rowland Adobe Redwood Ranch House as Walnut&#x27;s bicentennial project. In 1872, the Lemon Creek Park area became the property of Sheriff William Rowland, who inherited the ranch from his father, John Rowland. The modest structure built in 1883 served as the home of Mr. Meridith, ranch foreman for William Rowland. The adobe redwood ranch house is one of the few remaining original ranch style redwood and adobe structures in the area. On October 1, 1975, the State Landmark Committee placed the W.R. Rowland ranch house in the National Registry of Historical Places.

==History==
The Tongva were the earliest inhabitants of the San Gabriel Valley.
Governor Pío Pico sold much of the land of West Covina to John Rowland and William Workman in 1845.

The first permanent settlers arrived in West Covina in 1905. Most famous among them were William Payne, Bob Dancer, Bender, Robinson and Larsen. They cleared the land of sagebrush and cactus. They also planted the first walnut trees in the area.

West Covina was incorporated as an independent city in 1923 to prevent the city of Covina from building a sewage farm in the area. Benjamin Franklin Maxson Jr. (1897–1928) initiated the incorporation process and was the first mayor. Walnut groves and orange groves continued to flourish. The population in 1930 was 769 and blossomed to 1,549 in 1940.

<text>West Hollywood is a city in Los Angeles County, California, United States. Incorporated in 1984, it is home to the Sunset Strip. As of the 2020 U.S. Census, its population was 35,757.

==History==
Most historical writings about West Hollywood begin in the late-18th century with European colonization when the Portuguese explorer João Rodrigues Cabrilho traveled to and eventually laid claim on the region for Spain. Around 5,000 of the indigenous inhabitants from the Tongva Indian tribe canoed out to greet the ship. The Tongva tribe was a nation of hunter-gatherers known for their reverence for dance and courage. By 1771, these native people had been severely ravaged by the diseases brought in by the Europeans from across wide oceans. The Spanish mission system referred to the Tongva tribe as &quot;Gabrielinos&quot;, in reference to the Mission de San Gabriel. Early in 1770 Gaspar de Portola&#x27;s Mexican expeditionary force stopped just south of the Santa Monica Mountains near what would become West Hollywood. Here they collected pitch (&quot;brea&quot; in Spanish) from tar pits which they used to waterproof their belongings and to say Mass. The Gabrielinos are believed to have burned the pitch for fuel.

By 1780, what became the &quot;Sunset Strip&quot; was the major connecting road for El Pueblo de Los Angeles, and all ranches westward to the Pacific Ocean. This land passed through the hands of various owners during the next one hundred years, and it was called names such as &quot;La Brea&quot; and &quot;Plummer&quot; that are listed in historical records. Most of this area was part of the Rancho La Brea, and eventually it came to be owned by the Henry Hancock family.
During the final decade years of the nineteenth century, the first large land reconstruction of the town of &quot;Sherman&quot; significantly accelerated the development of the region. In what would later become West Hollywood—the town of &quot;Sherman&quot;—was established by Moses Sherman and his partners of the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad, an interurban railroad line which later became part of the Pacific Electric Railway system. Sherman became the location of the railroad&#x27;s main shops, railroad yards, and &quot;car barns&quot;. Many working-class employees of the railroad settled in this town. It was during this time that the city began to earn its reputation as a loosely regulated, liquor-friendly (during Prohibition) place for eccentric people wary of government interference. Despite several annexation attempts, the town elected not to become part of the City of Los Angeles. In 1925 Sherman adopted &quot;West Hollywood&quot;, &quot;...a moniker pioneered earlier in the decade by the West Hollywood Realty Board&quot; as its informal name, though it remained under the governance of Los Angeles County.

For many decades, the area that is now the city of West Hollywood was an unincorporated area in the midst of Los Angeles. Because gambling was illegal in the city of Los Angeles, but still legal in Los Angeles County, the 1920s saw the proliferation of many casinos, night clubs, etc., along Sunset Boulevard (which starts near downtown Los Angeles and runs westward). These businesses were immune from the sometimes heavy-handed law-enforcement of the L.A. Police Department.

Some people connected with movie-making were attracted to this less-restricted area of the County, and a number of architecturally distinctive apartment buildings and hotels were built. Many interior designers, decorators and &quot;to the trade&quot; furnishing showrooms located in West Hollywood date back to the middle of the century.

Eventually, the area and its extravagant nightclubs fell out of favor. The Sunset Strip and its restaurants, saloons, and nightclubs continued to be an attraction for out-of-town tourists. During the late 1960s, the Sunset Strip was transformed again during the hippie movement which brought a thriving music publishing industry coupled with the &quot;hippie&quot; culture. Some young people from all over the country flocked to West Hollywood.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, thousands of Russian Jews immigrated to the city. A majority of the 5,000 to 6,000 Russian Jews settled in two major immigration waves, 1978–79 and 1988–92. Other than New York, West Hollywood&#x27;s Russian-speaking community is the most concentrated single Russian-speaking region in the United States.

The Gauntlet was a body piercing business founded by Jim Ward in West Hollywood that is considered the first business of its type in the United States and was the beginning of the body piercing industry. The Gauntlet began in November 1975, with its original location in Ward&#x27;s West Hollywood home, but on the evening of Friday, November 17, 1978, it celebrated the grand opening of its first commercial location at 8720 Santa Monica Boulevard (also in West Hollywood).
Due to the expiration of rent control protections in LA County, a coalition of gay men, Russian Jews, and the elderly successfully held a vote to officially incorporate the City of West Hollywood in 1984. Voters elected a city council with an openly gay majority and it immediately passed a series of rent control measures to protect its longtime citizens. West Hollywood then immediately adopted one of the strongest rent control laws in the nation.

The city of West Hollywood gave the keys to the city to Stormy Daniels on &quot;Stormy Daniels Day&quot;, May 23, 2018.

==Geography==
West Hollywood is bounded by the city of Beverly Hills on the west, and by neighborhoods of the city of Los Angeles: Hollywood Hills on the north, Hollywood on the east, the Fairfax District on the southeast, and Beverly Grove on the southwest. The city&#x27;s irregular boundary is featured in its logo; it was largely formed from the unincorporated Los Angeles County area which had not become part of the surrounding cities.

West Hollywood benefits from a very dense, compact urban form with small lots, mixed land use, and a walkable street grid. According to Walkscore, a website that ranks cities based on walkability, West Hollywood is the most walkable city in California with a Walkscore of 89. Commercial corridors include the nightlife and dining focused on the Sunset Strip, along Santa Monica Boulevard, and the Avenues of Art and Design along Robertson Boulevard, Melrose Avenue, and Beverly Boulevard.

Residential neighborhoods in West Hollywood include the Norma Triangle, West Hollywood North, West Hollywood West, West Hollywood East, and West Hollywood Heights, all of which are only a few blocks long or wide. Major intersecting streets typically provide amenities within walking distance of adjacent neighborhoods.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
Traffic congestion, public transport and parking are critical issues in the city due to its location between access to areas such as Greater Hollywood to the east and the San Fernando Valley to the north and the area of the Los Angeles West Side, with the Hollywood Hills creating a natural impediment to the north. Santa Monica Boulevard and Sunset Boulevard are critical east-west arteries in the metropolitan area, and Laurel Canyon Boulevard is a popular shortcut through the hills. Nearly 600 employees and 260 buses in the District 7 fleet of the LACMTA are based in a large facility on prime real estate near San Vicente Boulevard and Santa Monica Boulevard. The K Line extension to the Hollywood/Highland station is likely to pass through, or along, the edge of West Hollywood.

===Social services===

West Hollywood, with a gay male population of about 39%, has been disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic which has ravaged its gay male population since the early 1980s. The city funds or subsidizes an array of services for those living with HIV or AIDS. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation parks a Mobile HIV/STD testing van outside of the city&#x27;s busiest nightclubs on Friday and Saturday nights, and again on Sunday afternoons. This outreach attempts to intervene with those young people most at-risk for HIV infection. Project Angel Food receives city funding to deliver hundreds of fresh lunches and dinners daily which are prepared under the supervision of a registered dietitian who tailors the meals to meet individual client&#x27;s nutritional needs. AIDS Project Los Angeles (APLA) is a national leader for AIDS policy and advocacy issues and provides assistance to clients navigating the maze of available public benefits. APLA also provides free dental, psychotherapy and pharmaceutical services. Aid for AIDS provides direct financial support by assisting clients with rent, utility and pharmacy expenses. The city also subsidizes agencies that help clients train for a return to the workforce. The city permits all residents living with HIV/AIDS to have up to two pets in his or her home regardless of a landlord&#x27;s specifications in the property&#x27;s lease.

West Hollywood subsidizes programs for its growing population of children through a partnership with the USDA and local schools. &quot;Healthy Start West Hollywood&quot; is a program of the city&#x27;s Social Services division that introduces pre-Kindergarten through High School age kids to the benefits of good nutrition through such activities as collective vegetable gardens and yoga.

The special needs of senior citizens are addressed through a variety of programs. West Hollywood either funds or subsidizes agencies that offer adult day care, a roommate matching service, and nutritious meals. The West Hollywood Senior Center provides recreational programs, excursions, and socializing as well as counseling and case management.

West Hollywood also seeks to address the health needs of residents who do not have adequate insurance by subsidizing the LA Free Clinic and The Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center. Residents can access free medical, dental, legal and mental health services between these two sites.

The West Hollywood&#x27;s Public Safety Division publishes guides on sexual assault prevention, nightclub safety, and how to access rape services.

===Public library===

County of Los Angeles Public Library operates the West Hollywood Library at 625 North San Vicente Boulevard.

Until early September 2011, the library was based at 715 North San Vicente Boulevard in a building designed by architect Edward H. Fickett. On September 6, 2011, the City demolished that building, which aroused controversy among some community members, including the architect&#x27;s wife.

The current library building officially opened to the public on October 1, 2011. The building, which was designed by architects Steve Johnson and James Favaro, received a favorable review in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that ended by calling it &quot;...a tremendously encouraging achievement&quot;. Exterior surfaces of the library building and adjacent parking structure are decorated with murals by Shepard Fairey, Kenny Scharf and Marquis Lewis (aka Retna), and the interior incorporates design work by Fairey and David Wiseman.

==Notable people==
The issue of Paparazzi chasing celebrities is raised regularly and the city participates in meetings with other nearby municipalities such as Beverly Hills and Los Angeles to discuss the problem and possible actions to better control the activity. The epicenter of the Thirty Mile Zone lies just blocks to the south of the city, and is the basis for the name of TMZ on TV, a paparazzi footage-based program. TMZ moved their operations from Sunset and Crescent Heights Boulevards to Los Angeles.

On May 28, 2018, Mayor John Duran announced that Stormy Daniels would receive the &quot;Key to the City&quot; alongside her attorney, Michael Avenatti. “In these politically tumultuous times, Stormy Daniels has proven herself to be a profile in courage by speaking truth to power even under threats to her safety and extreme intimidation from the current Administration”, said the mayor.

Actress Drew Barrymore grew up on Poinsettia Place until the age of 7, when she moved to Sherman Oaks; she moved back to West Hollywood at the age of 14.

==Landmarks and distinctive places==
Alta Loma Road is home to the Sunset Marquis Hotel with its 45-person Whisky Bar and NightBird Recording Studios, an underground music production facility. Alta Loma Road was one of the main locations for the film &quot;Perfect&quot;. Actor Sal Mineo lived on Holloway Drive in the 1970s; he was murdered in his carport just around the corner from Alta Loma.

The western stretch of Melrose Avenue, between Fairfax Avenue and Doheny Drive, is notable for its trendy clothing boutiques, interior design shops, restaurants and antique stores. The west end of Melrose Avenue, near the Pacific Design Center, is especially known for its exclusive furniture.

==Controversies==
===Discrimination issues===
Sometime in the 1940s, a sign appeared over the bar at Barney&#x27;s Beanery that said &quot;FAGOTS – STAY OUT.&quot; The message so offended locals that &quot;Life&quot; magazine did an article on opposition to the sign in 1964, which included a photograph of the owner steadfastly holding on to it. The owner died in 1968, and efforts continued to have the sign removed. The Gay Liberation Front organized a zap of the restaurant on February 7, 1970, to push for its removal. The sign disappeared that day. The sign was put up and taken down several times over the next 14 years, but the practice ended in December 1984, days after the city voted itself into existence. The then-mayor, Valerie Terrigno, the entire city council and gay-rights activists marched into Barney&#x27;s and relieved the wall of the offending sign. It was held by Morris Kight for many years and now rests in the ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives.

Jewel-Thais Williams, who owned the bar Jewel&#x27;s Catch One, originally opened the bar in 1973 because she experienced discrimination in both heterosexual bars and gay bars because she was both black and a woman.

A resident drew national attention during the 2008 presidential campaign by including a Sarah Palin mannequin hung in effigy in a Halloween display. The home&#x27;s decorations also featured a doll of John McCain surrounded by decorative flames in the chimney. Some residents complained about the display as a hate crime, but the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department concluded the display did not violate any laws.

In March 2006, agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Secret Service seized 250 fake denomination notes, each bearing a denomination of $1 billion, from a West Hollywood apartment.

===Celebrity incidents===
In 1982, John Belushi died of a drug overdose at the Chateau Marmont hotel in Hollywood, adjacent to WeHo. On the night of his death, he was visited separately by friends Robin Williams (at the height of his own drug exploits) and Robert De Niro, each of whom left the premises, leaving Belushi in the company of assorted others, including Cathy Smith.
On Halloween night in 1993, actor River Phoenix died at age 23 of a drug overdose at The Viper Room, a club that was opened that year and was partly owned by actor Johnny Depp until 2004.

On January 8, 2006, New Zealand film director Lee Tamahori, dressed as a woman, was arrested for allegedly offering an undercover police officer oral sex on the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and Lodi Place. He was convicted only of criminal trespass, having pleaded no contest in exchange for other charges being dropped.

On November 17, 2006, during a performance at the Laugh Factory, a cell phone video captured Michael Richards shouting &quot;Shut up&quot; to a heckler in the audience, followed by repeated shouts of &quot;He&#x27;s a nigger!&quot; to the rest of the audience (using the word six times altogether), and also making a reference to lynching.

==Legislation==
In 1985, West Hollywood was the first city to create a same-gender domestic partnership registration for its residents, as well as to offer same-gender domestic partner benefits for city employees. West Hollywood&#x27;s comprehensive Domestic Partnership Ordinance allows those couples that are prohibited from marrying (same-sex) and those who can marry but choose not to (heterosexual), to register their union with the city. These unions are treated on an equal basis with legal marriages with respect to city-level benefits and services. In California as a whole, same-sex couples may enter domestic partnerships which offer them all of the state rights of marriage.

West Hollywood has inclusionary zoning laws governing development. The city established the Affordable Housing Trust Fund in 1986 requiring developers to either provide affordable housing in new projects or pay a fee in-lieu to the city which it directs towards other affordable housing projects.

In 1993 the West Hollywood City Council voted for West Hollywood to become the first official pro-choice city in America.

In 2006, the City Council passed a medicinal marijuana resolution, by a vote of 4–0, making it the first city in Southern California to adopt a lowest law enforcement priority law for cannabis offenses. The resolution stated, &quot;it is not the policy of the City or its law enforcement agency to target possession of small amounts of cannabis and the consumption of non-medical cannabis in private by adults&quot;.

West Hollywood adopted one of the nation&#x27;s first mandatory green building ordinances on October 1, 2007.

The city designed a law that pets are to be called &quot;companions&quot; and their owners &quot;guardians&quot; and was the first city in the country to outlaw the de-clawing of cats. In 2011, West Hollywood became the first city in the United States to ban the sale of clothing with real animal fur; the ban took effect on September 21, 2013. In May 2014, the ordinance was upheld by the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, after a local business had challenged the prohibition as unconstitutional.

Legislation prohibiting discrimination in the workplace on the basis of sexual orientation is widely recognized as the toughest in the nation. The city is one of 225 jurisdictions in the country where it is illegal to discriminate on the basis of gender identity or expression.

City legislation bans the sale of handguns, prohibits smoking in public places, and restricts the city from doing business directly or indirectly (via vendors) with any country known to violate human rights. The city has banned the use of gas-powered leaf blowers.

As of July 2023, West Hollywood has the country&#x27;s highest minimum wage, at $19.08 per hour.

<text>Westmont is an unincorporated community in Los Angeles County, California, a part of the South Los Angeles area, just east of Inglewood. The population was 33,913 at the 2020 census, up from 31,853 at the 2010 census. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Westmont as a census-designated place (CDP).

==Geography==
Westmont has a total area of , all land. It adjoins the Vermont Vista neighborhood of the city of Los Angeles.

==History==

In 2009, Westmont was the subject of a feature story by Hector Tobar in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; who wrote that the community was &quot;officially (but rarely) called Westmont&quot; but that it had &quot;no &quot;&#x27;mont,&#x27; not even a hill. It got its name, it seems, from being west of Vermont Avenue.&quot; Tobar noted that Westmont&#x27;s unemployment rate was at the time &quot;a staggering 23.6%, the highest in Los Angeles County.&quot;

Five years later, the strip of Vermont Avenue which is shared between Westmont and Vermont Vista was called &quot;death alley&quot; by the newspaper because during the past seven years sixty people had been killed by violence on that two-mile stretch. It remained at the highest rate of killings of any neighborhood in Los Angeles County.

The 2014 article stated that &quot;The area was long been controlled by a gang named the Underground Crips, whose members would, in more violent days, walk across Normandie Avenue to shoot at rivals.&quot;

==Demographics==
According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, fewer than six percent of residents held bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 2000. The neighborhood is fraught with gang and police-related violence, as well as structural racism and entrenched poverty.

<text>Whittier () is a city in Southern California in Los Angeles County, part of the Gateway Cities. The city had 87,306 residents as of the 2020 United States census, an increase of 1,975 from the 2010 census figure. Whittier was incorporated in February 1898 and became a charter city in 1955. The city is named for the Quaker poet John Greenleaf Whittier and is home to Whittier College. The city is surrounded by three unincorporated areas sharing the Whittier name, West Whittier-Los Nietos, South Whittier, and East Whittier, which combined are home to a larger population than Whittier proper.

==Etymology==
In the founding days of Whittier, when it was a small, isolated town, Jonathan Bailey and his wife, Rebecca, were among the first residents. They followed the Quaker religious faith and practice and held religious meetings on their porch. Other early settlers, such as Aquila Pickering, also espoused the Quaker faith. As the city grew, the citizens named it after John Greenleaf Whittier, a respected Quaker poet, and deeded a lot to him. Whittier wrote a dedication poem and is honored today with statues and a small exhibit at the Whittier Museum; a statue of him sits in Whittier&#x27;s Central Park, and another representing his poem &quot;The Barefoot Boy&quot; used to reside by the City Hall and is now in front of the main library. Whittier never set foot there, but the city still bears his name and is rooted in the Quaker tradition.

==History==
The Gabrielino first inhabited the area.

Whittier&#x27;s roots can be traced to Spanish soldier Manuel Nieto. In 1784, Nieto received a Spanish land grant of , Rancho Los Nietos, as a reward for his military service and to encourage settlement in California. The area of Nieto&#x27;s land grant was reduced in 1790 as the result of a dispute with Mission San Gabriel. Nonetheless, Nieto still had a claim to stretching from the hills north of Whittier, Fullerton, and Brea, south to the Pacific Ocean, and from what is known today as the Los Angeles River east to the Santa Ana River. Nieto built a rancho for his family near Whittier, purchased cattle and horses for his ranch, and planted cornfields. When he died in 1804, his children inherited his property.

At the time of the 1840s Mexican–American War, much of the land that became Whittier was owned by Pio Pico, a rancher and the last Mexican governor of Alta California. Pio Pico built a hacienda on the San Gabriel River, known today as Pio Pico State Historic Park. After the war, German immigrant Jacob F. Gerkens paid the U.S. government $234 to acquire of land under the Homestead Act and built the cabin known today as the Jonathan Bailey House. Gerkens later become the Los Angeles Police Department&#x27;s first chief of police. His land was owned by several others before a group of Quakers purchased it and expanded it to , intending to found a Quaker community. The area soon became known as a thriving citrus ranching region, with &quot;Quaker Brand&quot; fruit shipped all over the United States. Beginning in 1887, walnut trees were planted, and Whittier became the nation&#x27;s largest walnut grower. In addition to walnuts and citrus, Whittier was also a significant producer of pampas grass.

For many years, the sole means of transport from this area to Los Angeles was by foot or horse and wagon over rough dirt roads, impeding settlement, development, and the export of agriculture. Thus in 1887 &quot;enterprising and aggressive businessmen&quot; contracted with the Southern Pacific Railroad to build the first railroad spur to Whittier, including a depot. The businessmen covered the $43,000 construction cost for the six-mile spur, which branched off from the Southern Pacific mainline at a junction near what is now Studebaker Road between Firestone Boulevard and Imperial Highway. By 1906, 650 carloads of oranges and 250 carloads of lemons were shipped annually by rail. In 1904, the Pacific Electric opened the trolley line known as &quot;Big Red Cars&quot; from Los Angeles to Whittier. In the first two decades, over a million passengers a year rode to and from Los Angeles on the Whittier Line.

During the 1920s and 30s, Whittier was a conservative sundown town. New housing tracts such as College Hills were developed under restrictive covenants and minorities were restricted to areas outside the city limits such as Jimtown (portions of which were destroyed by the building of the 605 Freeway). Whittier even had a branch of the Silver Shirts. Liquor sales were forbidden in the city; Bailey&#x27;s Liquor Store was just outside the city limits. Richard Nixon, though born and buried in Yorba Linda, grew up in East Whittier. He attended and played football at Whittier High School (1928–30) and Whittier College (1930–34) In the 1930s, Nixon&#x27;s law office was in the National Bank of Whittier Building in Uptown Whittier. Upon Nixon&#x27;s return from World War II service, conservative Whittier businessman Herman Perry, Nixon&#x27;s former landlord at the bank, spearheaded an effort to form a Committee of 100 Republicans in Eastern Los Angeles County to get Nixon elected to Congress in 1946.

After World War II, Whittier grew rapidly. The subdividing of orange groves began, driven by housing shortages in southern California. In 1955, the Civic Center complex was completed, and the City Council met in new chambers for the first time on March 8, 1955. The city continued to grow as it annexed portions of Whittier Boulevard and East Whittier. The 1961 annexation added over 28,000 people to the population, bringing the total to about 67,000. South and West Whittier remained unannexed by the city.

===Quakers===

The first Quaker meetings were held on the front porch of the Jonathan Bailey House. As more Quakers arrived, the need for an actual Quaker meeting house arose, and the first one was built in 1887 on the corner of Comstock Avenue and Wardman Street. The meeting soon outgrew this 100-seat meeting house, and a larger building was erected on the corner of Philadelphia Street and Washington Avenue in 1902. By 1912, membership had grown to 1,200, and a third building was dedicated on the same site in 1917. With a capacity of 1,700, the 1917 meeting house had a balcony and was constructed of brick with mahogany paneling and pews. The present meeting house, dedicated in 1975, has many architectural elements and materials from the 1917 building, including the stained glass windows and mahogany interior. The Quakers also founded Whittier Academy (later Whittier College), and additional meetings met in East Whittier and at Whittier College&#x27;s Mendenhall. The Mendenhall and East Whittier meetings kept the silent meeting longer than the main church.

===Colleges===

In 1887, the Pickering Land and Water Company set aside a parcel of land to develop a college, but a collapse in the land boom stalled construction. Progress on developing a college was sporadic, but on July 30, 1896, the Whittier Academy, operating since 1891, officially changed its name to Whittier College and enrolled 100 students. The school mascot is &quot;The Poet.&quot; By 1906, Whittier College was an educational institution with laboratories, boarding halls, a large gymnasium, and athletic fields. Due to an economic depression in the 1890s, the first bachelor&#x27;s degrees were not awarded at the college for 17 years.

Leona May Mendenhall donated the Mendenhall Building at Whittier College in honor of her husband, Oscar. The Mendenhalls were among Whittier&#x27;s founding families. Oscar&#x27;s brother, Samuel Mendenhall, helped bring in the water system and post office. The Mendenhalls were major growers of Sunkist oranges and Blue Diamond walnuts.

Whittier was the first home to Azusa Pacific University, established in 1899 by the Quaker community and a Methodist evangelist under the name Training School for Christian Workers.

===Whittier Narrows earthquake===

On October 1, 1987, at 7:42 a.m., the Whittier Narrows earthquake struck, the epicenter north-northwest of Whittier. The seismic event, which registered 5.9 on the moment magnitude scale, killed eight people and damaged many of uptown Whittier&#x27;s historic buildings. Three days later, on October 4 at 3:59 a.m., a major aftershock measuring 5.2 caused further damage. Buildings and residential structures that were already borderline unsafe were now deemed unsafe or uninhabitable. In the years following the earthquake, the city&#x27;s deteriorating uptown business district became the focus of renewed development, meeting opposition from many Whittier citizens. The Whittier Conservancy was formed in 1987 to stop the demolition of many historic buildings and residences after the disaster. The city also created a Historic Resources Commission to oversee the approval of landmark designations, historic districts, and Mills Act proposals. The Whittier Narrows earthquake destroyed The Quad at Whittier, a shopping mall that was rebuilt.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , virtually all land.

Whittier is bordered by Hacienda Heights to the northeast, City of Industry to the north, and several other unincorporated communities in the San Gabriel Valley mostly along its northern sections. Pico Rivera lies to the west, La Habra Heights to the east, La Habra to the southeast, and Santa Fe Springs to the south.

===Neighborhoods===
Whittier has several neighborhoods. The area around Philadelphia Street and Greenleaf Avenue is known as Uptown Whittier and contains the traditional central business core. Just north of it are the neighborhoods known as Central Park and Hadley-Greenleaf. They have been designated historic districts by the city Historic Resources Commission and comprise most of the Whittier Historic Neighborhood Association area. These districts contain many Craftsman and Spanish Colonial Revival homes. In and abutting the hills north of the historic districts is Starlite Estates. The area surrounding Whittier College is known as College Hills and was also recently designated a historic district, as it has a small cluster of homes along Earlham Drive. The area east of College Avenue is called East Whittier. It was an unincorporated agricultural community until the postwar era. The eastern part of East Whittier, developed in the 1950s and 1960s, is known as Friendly Hills, and was developed at the same time as Murphy Ranch and Leffingwell Ranch. Friendly Hills and Murphy Ranch are generally considered north of Whittier Boulevard, while Leffingwell Ranch is south of it. The area at the extreme east of Whittier is occasionally called Sunglow.

=== Climate ===
Whittier is about inland of the Pacific Ocean, resulting in higher daytime temperatures, and since it lies at a higher elevation than the cities further west, cold air drains into the lower elevation of the Los Angeles Basin, causing warmer nighttime lows, an example of thermal inversion. Winter daytime highs typically range from with overnight lows dropping to about 41 °F to 50 °F (6° to 12 °C). In the summer highs range from and corresponding overnight lows in the . Rainfall follows a Mediterranean pattern, with most falling during winter, while summers tend to be rather dry. The mean annual rainfall is about .

On April 17, 1900, the Whittier Public Library Board of Trustees held its first meeting in Landrum Smith&#x27;s drugstore. With an initial collection of 60 books and 200 magazines, the library facilities began in the Woody Building as a reading room maintained by Hester in exchange for space for his telegraph office. In 1907, a Carnegie grant funded building construction at Bailey and Greenleaf that many Whittierites fondly remember. As the city expanded, a more extensive library was needed, and the Friends of the Library was organized in 1956 to raise money for a new building. Through their efforts and those of the board members, librarians, and citizen fundraising groups, the new library was completed at the Washington Avenue site in May 1959. In 1968, service was further expanded with the construction of the Whittwood Branch Library on Santa Gertrudes Avenue.

<text>Willowbrook, alternatively named Willow Brook, is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Los Angeles County, California. The population was 24,295 at the 2020 census, down from 35,983 at the 2010 census.

Willowbrook is the home to the newly renovated Martin Luther King Jr. Outpatient Center. Also located in Willowbrook is the Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science, which oversees residency training programs, allied health programs, a medical education program (jointly with the University of California, Los Angeles), a medical magnet high school, the area Head Start program, and various centers for health disparities research. Due to severe deficiencies, the former King/Drew Medical Center lost accreditation of several key residency training programs.

==History==

Long before the name &quot;Willowbrook&quot; was given, willows and a slow, shallow brook separated this portion of the Los Angeles plain from the rest of it. The original rancho boundary of the 1840s was a lone, streamside willow tree along the present intersection of 125th Street and Mona Boulevard.

In the early days, springs were abundant in Willowbrook. Winter rains brought up fine ryegrass stands between gravelly ridges left by the long-ago floods of the Los Angeles River. Anastacio Avila was grazing cattle on the land as early as 1820. The Mexican governor had granted him acres by 1843. The grant was called Rancho La Tajauta, and it extended from the marshes along present Alameda Street westward to approximately the present line of the Harbor Freeway. Within the area covered by Rancho La Tajauta is all of present-day Willowbrook.

In 1894 and 1895, the first subdivisions in the Willowbrook area were registered along what is now Rosecrans Avenue. The name of Willowbrook was first formally used when Willowbrook Tract was recorded by the County Recorder in 1903. Next to the tract was the recently opened Pacific Electric Railway to Long Beach. There is no indication that a townsite had been envisioned and that street patterns were not synchronized. The Willowbrook name came into use for the entire area, because Pacific Electric Railroad Company&#x27;s Big Red Cars stopped at Willowbrook&#x27;s 126th Street. The first branch of the Los Angeles County Free Library was established in Willowbrook: &quot;It was opened in April, 1913, in a private house, but has been located for several years since in the post office building.&quot;

In Willowbrook, lot purchasers expected to live a definitely suburban life. The deep lots, sometimes 300 feet or 91 meters in depth, attracted working-class families, especially newcomers to Southern California. The Big Red Cars offered fast and convenient transport to shops in downtown Los Angeles and jobs in port areas of Long Beach and San Pedro. During the Depression years, residents used the land behind their homes to cultivate fruits and vegetables, run hogs, and raise chickens. This use of land, along with the vacant lots filled with mustard plants, enhanced the rural appearance of the area. Increased suburban growth occurred in Willowbrook after the end of the Depression and World War II, but not so much that the agricultural character of the area was drastically modified. Even the Watts Riots of 1965 did not change that, although Willowbrook had a variety of buildings, including the community library of Willowbrook, damaged.

The blend of agricultural and residential land use persisted at Willowbrook into the early 1980s, when a redevelopment plan drawn up by the Watts Labor Community Action Committee from 1965 to 1993 and funded by Los Angeles County caused the area to lose its rural character. acres of Willowbrook land were redeveloped under this plan to include new commercial and residential facilities. The appearance of present-day Willowbrook is similar to other communities in the South Central section of Los Angeles because of this.

<text>Bonadelle Ranchos and Madera Ranchos are a pair of communities in Madera County, California, United States. They are part of the Madera–Chowchilla Metropolitan Statistical Area. Prior to 2020, the communities were part of the Bonadelle Ranchos-Madera Ranchos Census Designated Place, with a population of 8,569 at the 2010 census. For the 2020 census, the area was split into two CDPs, Bonadelle Ranchos and Madera Ranchos.

==General information==
The Bonadelle Ranchos-Madera Ranchos community is located at (36.936378, -119.886723).

According to the United States Census Bureau, in 2010 the CDP had a total area of , all of it land.

==Environment==

The Bonadelle Ranchos is often regarded as a Valley-Foothill transitional zone, because its elevation is higher than average for valley but slightly too low to be considered part of the Sierra foothills. About to the northeast lie the rugged foothills of the Sierra Nevada range. Its environment corresponds, showing qualities of a transition zone. The northeast portion of the area is the highest in elevation, and small tabletop hills are present: most notably Adobe Hill, with an elevation of . Throughout the area there are large, rolling hills. Multiple creeks run through the area, but none are large enough to bring constant flow. The creeks include Little Dry Creek, Bonadelle Creek, Cottonwood Creek, and Root Creek. Many of these waterways flow in the winter months, when rainfall and snow filter down from the nearby foothills. There are many seasonal ponds in the area, but most are too small and short-lived to offer recreational activities. Much of the wildlife is typical for this type of environment. Mammals include foxes, ground squirrels, coyotes, raccoons, skunks and occasionally bobcats and mountain lions. Dove, crows, ravens, ducks, Scrub jays, California woodpeckers, egrets, red tailed hawks, turkey vultures, and geese can be found as well.

==Climate==
The climate in this area is noticeably different than the nearby cities, often cooler during the winter months. Because of the openness of the surrounding areas, wind and storm systems can often become a temperature factor.

The climate in the area varies drastically throughout the year. Spring in the area is warm and mild, starting in March and ending in May. Temperatures generally reach the high 60s (in March). April-Mays highs reach the 70s and 80s, and nightly lows can still be in the mid 30s (in April), although the average low is . Many trees often begin to bloom as early as March.

Summer in the area is very hot and starts in June, lasting until early October. Temperatures regularly exceed . Sun is constant with essentially no clouds. Nightly lows in the area generally are in the high 50s and 60s, although some extremes have even reached the high 40s. Because of the virtual absence of rainfall, drought is constant through summer, and the risk of fire is high.

Fall in the area is mild, with highs in the 60s and 70s (°F), although some late fall patterns have highs still in the 80s. Fall is usually short lived, only encompassing mid-October until the end of November. That is typically when winter weather starts to move in. Nightly lows can greatly vary this time of year. Lows are generally , but in some cases can reach as low as .

Winters are generally mild, although variances can occur. The area experiences thick Tule fog, which is extremely dense fog that limits visibility to in some cases. Tule fog can last all day, although this is not a very common occurrence. The area experiences rain from November to March. Snow is never present in any measurable amount, but in some cases precipitation and temperature can coincide and bring flurries. They are short and nearly impactless. Winter lows can dip down quite low for California standards, as lows have been known to drop down to the high teens and 20s, although most winter lows are in the 30s and frost is quite prevalent. Highs in winter are in the 40s–50s, and most days are sunny with high-altitude clouds. Very windy days are present every winter, and these patterns may last for weeks at a time.

==History==
The Bonadelle Ranchos has a relatively long history, but not much is known about it. John Bonadelle, the founder of the area, was a landowner and owned most of the properties in the area. Many of the streets were named by him. Street names were often sold to people in Hollywood, who sometimes named them after themselves. Settlement began as early as 1940, but the movement trend boomed in the 1970s and continued on.

Bonadelle originally purchased the land from one of the three Smith family siblings that split the land into thirds once their father had passed. Currently, Kirby Smith still owns a comparable amount of land to the Bonadelle Ranchoes, which lies to the east and continues until Highway 41.

<doc id="107712" wikidata="Q2008503" url="?curid=107712" title="Oakhurst, California">
<text>Oakhurst (formerly Fresno Flats) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Madera County, California, United States, south of the entrance to Yosemite National Park, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. At an elevation of , Oakhurst is situated at the junction of Highway 41 and Highway 49, marking the southern end of California&#x27;s Gold Country. It is part of the Madera metropolitan statistical area.

Oakhurst originated in 1858 as Fresno Flats, evolving from a ranching community to a hub for the timber industry and later, tourism. The town was renamed Oakhurst in 1912 following a secret petition by a resident after a local stagecoach robbery. The area was historically a meeting ground for the Miwok, Yokut, and Mono tribes. However, the enactment of the Act for the Government and Protection of Indians in 1850 led to the displacement of many Native Americans, catalyzing the Mariposa War, the first battle of which was fought near present-day Oakhurst.

From 1981 to 1999, Oakhurst was home to Sierra On-Line, a pioneer in the computer game industry, known for creating the first 3D adventure game and the first dedicated online gaming network.

==Geography==
Oakhurst is located south-southwest of Yosemite Forks, along the Fresno River, and sits at an elevation of .

Surrounded by mountains in the upper Sierra Nevada foothills, Oakhurst acts as a significant geographic crossroads. It is bordered by the Fresno River to the west and north. To the south, there are roads leading to the San Joaquin Valley, and to the east, paths extend to Crane Flat and the High Sierra. Historically, this strategic positioning made Oakhurst an important meeting location for Native American tribes across Central California. Today, Oakhurst remains a critical hub, connecting mountain routes that lead in all four compass directions.

Oakhurst is positioned at the southern end of California&#x27;s Gold Country, on Highway 49. It bridges the San Joaquin Valley and the Yosemite Valley via Highway 41. Nearby communities include Ahwahnee, Coarsegold and Bass Lake. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.02%, are water.

==History==

===Native people===

Oakhurst was a common meeting ground for the Miwoks, Yokuts, and Monos before the time of the California Gold Rush.

Many Native Californians were displaced by white settlers following the enactment of the Act for the Government and Protection of Indians in 1850. This act facilitated the removal and displacement of Native Californian Indians from their traditional lands, and led to the Mariposa War, the first battle of which was fought near present-day Oakhurst on January 11, 1851. By June 1851, most Native Americans in the region had been relocated to the Fresno River Farm Reservation, opening the region to the first permanent white settlers.

===Fresno Flats===
Oakhurst&#x27;s existence began in 1858 as &quot;Fresno Flats,&quot; named for the Spanish word for ash trees and flat, a colloquial term for a mountain meadow.

Unlike most nearby towns along what is now the Golden Chain Highway., Fresno Flats was not founded due to the discovery of precious metals in the nineteenth century.

John Robert Nichols, a rancher, was likely the first Anglo settler in Fresno Flats in 1858. Others joined him, raising livestock and planting orchards, establishing the area permanently. Post-gold rush, the first Chinese family settled by a creek flowing into the Fresno River. As more Chinese families used it, the creek was named China Creek, which remains its name.

Fresno Flats opened its first post office in 1873. The following year, the Madera Flume and Lumber Company started building a log flume by the Fresno River, sparking the local timber industry. By 1876, a wagon road from Madera to Yosemite was complete, shifting the area&#x27;s main economic focus to tourism. Fresno Flats grew into a key station on this road to Wawona, boasting hotels, stores, a blacksmith, a skating rink, a dancehall, a schoolhouse, and saloons by 1884. The first school, made of logs, was built in 1871, and by 1884, it had an average attendance of 26.9 students with one teacher.

===Name change===
Fresno Flats lost its name in 1912 after a resident secretly petitioned the town be renamed over fear that the town&#x27;s reputation was forever tarnished because of a local stagecoach robbery. The town was renamed Oakhurst by an Act of Congress that took most people in town by surprise.

===Highway Era===
Oakhurst&#x27;s decline started with the mining industry collapse, the end of stagecoach travel to Yosemite, and the 1931 closure of the Madera Sugar Pine Company. The All-Year Highway, opened in 1926, rerouted Yosemite bound auto traffic via California State Route 140 through Merced, further reducing visitor numbers and economic activity in Oakhurst. A new highway route to Yosemite came to fruition in the 1930s with the Fresno-Yosemite road, known today as California State Route 41. This route shortened the trip from Fresno to Yosemite Valley by 35 miles.

Over 1.2 million people annually enter Yosemite National Park through its south gate, predominantly passing through Oakhurst on Highway 41. Tourism significantly affects Oakhurst, especially during summer. This season sees the highest traffic on Highway 41, full hotel occupancy, and a peak in jobs serving visitors, including lodging, dining, retail, and transportation services. The total sales for accommodation and food services in 2017 were $36.5 million dollars. In contrast, these activities and related employment decrease in winter due to reduced off-season activities in Yosemite and surrounding areas.

===Sierra On-Line===
The pioneering computer game developer Sierra On-Line was based in Oakhurst from 1981 to 1999. The company achieved many industry firsts, including the development of the first 3D adventure game (&quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot;, 1984) and one of the first online gaming networks (&quot;The Sierra Network&quot;, 1989).

==Demographics==

Oakhurst, California, has experienced notable demographic and socio-economic transformations between the 2000 and 2020 census periods. The population more than doubled from 2,868 to 5,945, with a significant increase in households and a shift towards a younger age demographic. While remaining predominantly White, the community saw fluctuations in its Hispanic or Latino population, rising from 9.94% in 2000 to 16.7% in 2010, and then slightly decreasing to 12.0% by 2020. Socio-economic developments included a substantial rise in median household income from $27,679 to $73,333, alongside high rates of educational attainment and technological adoption. Despite these socio-economic improvements, challenges in poverty rates and health insurance coverage persist, reflecting ongoing issues within the community.

The growth of short-term rental platforms like Airbnb has influenced the housing market. As more property owners opt for short-term rentals due to higher potential earnings, the availability of long-term rental housing has decreased. This shift has contributed to increased competition and rising rental prices for residents, prompting discussions about potential regulations to balance tourism benefits with the community&#x27;s housing needs.

===2020===
According to the 2020 census, the CDP has a population of 5,945 across 2,180 households.

===Honorary mayor===
Oakhurst, an unincorporated area, does not have an official mayor. Instead, an Honorary Mayor is selected annually through a fundraising competition where candidates generate funds for selected non-profits, with each dollar equating to one vote. The top fundraiser is named Honorary Mayor, a tradition that has supported local charities by raising significant amounts over the years.

==Education==
Oakhurst is home to Yosemite High School and the headquarters for the Yosemite Unified School District. Many primary schools across eastern Madera County feed into the high school.

Oakhurst Community College Center is a two-year institution that offers programs in two-year degrees and general education for transfer.

The State Center Community College District Board of Trustees approved plans to relocate the Oakhurst campus to a new 30-acre site along Highway 49. Construction on the new campus officially began in October 2024.

==Attractions==

===The Talking Bear===

Celebrated as both a local landmark and roadside attraction, the Talking Bear is a prominent fiberglass grizzly bear statue located at the intersection of Highway 41 and Road 426. Known for its distinctive design and cultural significance, the statue has become a notable feature in the area since it was installed in 1965. Visitors press a button to hear a recorded message about the California Grizzly Bear. Hugh Schollenbarger installed the bear which was made by Alpine&#x27;s Fiberglass Menagerie Co.

===Historic Buildings===

The Little Church on the Hill was built in 1894 and moved from Chapel Hill to its current location in Oakhill Cemetery in 1957. Built from sugar pine lumber from the local mills, it was the first house of worship in Fresno Flats and met the needs of all denominations for over 50 years. The church and cemetery were designated as California Point of Historical Interest in 1994.

Many original pioneer structures are on display at the Fresno Flats Historical Village and Park including the 1869 Taylor Log House, where Boot Taylor, one of the first Sierra National Forest rangers was raised, the two-story Laramore-Layman House, built in the 1870s, the Raymond Jail built in 1890, and several single-room schoolhouses.

===Sierra Mountaineer Days===

Sierra Mountaineer Days, an annual festival established in 1964, became a significant event, drawing over 10,000 visitors each year at its peak. The three-day event featured a parade, barbecue, rodeo, and beauty pageant, celebrating the region&#x27;s history. It focused on the 19th-century miners&#x27; lifestyle and the importance of the logging industry, highlighting the area&#x27;s rich heritage.

In the late 1990s, the festival experienced a revival and was renamed Mountain Heritage Day, now held at Fresno Flats Historic Village. This modern version of the event continues to honor the area&#x27;s unique cultural and historical background.

Belvedere and Tiburon share a post office and the 94920 ZIP code.

== Location ==
Belvedere is located at , about north of San Francisco.

Belvedere&#x27;s two islands are Belvedere Island and Corinthian Island. Corinthian Island is shared with Tiburon.

Belvedere Lagoon is situated between the two causeways (Beach Road and San Rafael Avenue) that connect Belvedere Island to the town of Tiburon.

Belvedere has a total area of , of which is land and (78%) is water.

== History ==
Belvedere incorporated as a city in 1896. Its first post office was opened in 1897.

Belvedere&#x27;s City Hall was originally a Presbyterian Church. It was moved to its present location on San Rafael Avenue in 1949.

Actress Vivian Vance, who played Ethel on &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, died in Belvedere in 1979 at the age of 70.

In 2017, Belvedere became a twin city with Portofino, Italy.

== Houses ==
Depending on where their homes are located, residents of Belvedere enjoy views of San Francisco, Angel Island, Sausalito, the Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco and Richardson Bays, and Mount Tamalpais.

Houses on Belvedere and Corinthian Islands encompass a range of periods and architectural styles from Victorian to Mediterranean to post-and-beam &quot;mid-century modern&quot;. Many are &quot;cliff-hangers&quot;. Houses on the Belvedere Lagoon were designed by architects in the 1950s and 1960s. Houses on the lagoon have their own boat docks. Many of the homes on Belvedere and Corinthian Islands have docks with access to San Francisco Bay.

A number of Belvedere homes are listed on the National Register of Historic Places; e.g., the Valentine Rey House designed by Willis Polk and built in 1893. Notable designers of homes in Belvedere have included Joseph Esherick, Albert Farr, who designed the Belvedere Land Company building and cottages, Henry Gutterson, and Charles Warren Callister.

New construction has become a contentious issue as residents have become frustrated with large projects that they believe are negatively affecting the character of the community.

<text>Black Point-Green Point is a census-designated place (CDP) in Marin County, California, United States. It is unincorporated, sitting between the city of Novato to the southwest and the Petaluma River and San Pablo Bay to the northeast. The population was 1,431 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Black Point was part of the Rancho de Novato land grant. The &quot;1880 History of Marin County&quot; by Alley, Bowen and Co. mentions &quot;a man by name of Day&quot; who &quot;settled on an island in Novato township which has since borne his name&quot; in 1851. This island is still known as Day Island. According to the book, several more settlers moved into the area in 1853. Some of them owned land there, while others were squatters, a problem common across the county. Lumber that came from Black Point was used to build part of the USS &quot;Saginaw&quot;, a steamer built at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. It served in the navy until 1870, when it ran aground on a reef not far from Ocean island. Deer Island, a former island east of Olive Avenue, actually was an island in the early 1900s. The house on the island, owned by Antonio DeBorba, whose shop on Grant Avenue is still intact, was completely encompassed by water, and his house was only accessible by boat. When both the county and the state refused to build a levee, he spent a small fortune deepening the creek and taking water out of the marsh. Once that was done, he donated the land that is now Highway 37.

The first Black Point post office operated from 1865 to 1891. The Grandview post office opened in 1905, changed its name to Black Point in 1944, and closed in 1952. Black Point-Green Point is located along the Brazos Railroad Subdivision, with Northwestern Pacific running trains through twice a week. Trains passing through Black Point-Green Point cross the Black Point Railroad Bridge, built in 1911. The fields to the south of Black Point were used for the location of the Black Point Communications Annex, an antenna array that was used to communicate with the Hamilton Air Force Base.

==Geography==
Black Point-Green Point is east of the center of Novato and north of San Rafael, the Marin county seat. The Petaluma River, which forms the northeast edge of the community, is the Sonoma County line.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which , or 2.42%, are water. Black Point-Green Point is also located near various public lands, such as the Rush Creek Open Space Preserve and the Vince Mulroy Wildlife Prerserve.

==Commercial activity==
There are several businesses in Black Point-Green Point, such as Rossi&#x27;s Deli (an old gas station built in the 1930s), Penske Truck Rental, Kelleher Lumber, and two self-storages. There used to be an inn built during the 1890s, but it burned down in the spring of 1976. Black Point also used to have a train station and a freight depot near the lumberyard. Both the Northwestern Pacific Railroad and the Black Point Aggregates company used to operate a quarry in Black Point to produce ballast and fills for the railroad, as well as shipment abroad. The steep scars are still visible, although the flattened area is now part of the StoneTree Golf Course. Black Point was the location of the annual Northern California Renaissance Faire from 1971 to 1998, after which the site was developed into the StoneTree Golf Course.

<text>Bolinas is an unincorporated coastal community and census-designated place in Marin County, California, United States. As of the 2020 census it had a population of 1,483. It is located on the California coast, approximately (straight line distance) northwest of San Francisco, and by road.

The community is known for its reclusive residents. It is only accessible via unmarked roads; any road sign along State Route 1 that points the way into town has been torn down by local residents, to the point where county officials offered a ballot measure to which the voters responded by stating a preference for no more signs.

== History ==

Prior to the European colonization of California, the Coast Miwok lived in the area, possibly calling the area &quot;Bali-N&quot;.

Bolinas and present-day Stinson Beach were once encompassed by Rancho Las Baulines, a Mexican land grant given by Governor Pío Pico to Gregorio Briones in 1846.

The first post office in the town of Bolinas opened in 1863. The post office closed on March 3, 2023, leaving the town more isolated. The town&#x27;s residents have petitioned for it to reopen. 

In 1927, a former dairy farm on the Big Mesa was subdivided into a grid of streets and 5,336 lots measuring . Many of these lots were sold for $69.50 by the San Francisco Bulletin as a subscription promotion. Portions of the mesa, including sections of Ocean Parkway, have since eroded into the sea. A few streets on the mesa are paved and maintained by the county, but many are unpaved, and either maintained by adjoining property owners or completely unmaintained. The Big Mesa has no sewer system, and houses on the mesa have individual septic systems.

The Bolinas beaches were hit hard by the 1971 San Francisco Bay oil spill, with the community coming together to clean the beach of crude oil.

The Bolinas Museum was founded in 1983. Today, it contains five galleries featuring contemporary art, historical information, and works from local artists. Today, it puts on auctions and events for locals and visitors alike.

== Geography ==

Bolinas sits at an elevation of above sea level. It is bound on the northeast by Bolinas Lagoon and Kent Island, on the south by Bolinas Bay and Duxbury Point, on the southwest by the Pacific Ocean, and on the northwest by Point Reyes National Seashore. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land. The GNIS has cited archaic alternate town-names, including &quot;Ballenas&quot;, &quot;Baulenas&quot;, &quot;Baulings&quot;, and &quot;Bawlines&quot;.

Bolinas&#x27; downtown is located on the eastern side of town along Wharf Road, which ends at Bolinas Lagoon. The downtown buildings were mostly built between 1850 and 1920. Brighton Avenue connects downtown to the south-facing Brighton Beach. In the southeast corner of town is the Little Mesa. The Big Mesa, also known as the Gridded Mesa, lies to the west, with Agate Beach at its western end.

By air, Bolinas is just west-southwest of San Rafael, and northwest of San Francisco. While located just from State Route 1, the area is not very accessible by car. The driving time from San Rafael is roughly 52 minutes, and it takes over an hour to drive to downtown San Francisco.

Bolinas lies west of the San Andreas Fault, which runs the length of Bolinas Lagoon and continues northward through Olema Valley and Tomales Bay. Bolinas and the Point Reyes peninsula are on the Pacific Plate, moving north relative to Stinson Beach and the North American Plate at an average rate of about per year.

Point Reyes National Seashore borders Bolinas to the northwest. Duxbury Reef State Marine Conservation Area encompasses Bolinas&#x27; western shoreline.

===Climate===
Bolinas experiences warm (occasionally hot) and dry summers, with some average monthly days in summer months above . According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Bolinas has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps. Like much of the California coast, summer afternoons are often cool and windy (and sometimes foggy) as winds blow in off the ocean.
It receives more rain than other coast cities in the San Francisco Bay Area in this latitude with of rain.

==Education==
Bolinas is in the Bolinas-Stinson Union School District, the Tamalpais Union High School District, and the Marin Community College District. Students in primary grades (kindergarten – grade 2) attend Stinson Beach School, while elementary grade students (grades 3–8) attend Bolinas School. Bolinas is included in the attendance area of Tamalpais High School, in Mill Valley.

In 1951, &quot;Ford Times&quot; identified Bolinas as the first in its series of &quot;Tom Sawyer Towns... a good place for boys and girls to live and grow... its school days, its summer vacations, its vast adventures in fishing, swimming, baseball, basking and dreaming in the sun. Such a place is Bolinas.&quot;

==Government==

Bolinas is unincorporated, receiving general government services from Marin County, including law enforcement, land use planning, public health, and code enforcement. Two special districts provide local services. The Bolinas Community Public Utility District provides water and wastewater service and contracts for garbage and recycling collection. The Bolinas Fire Protection District provides fire protection, emergency medical care, and disaster management services.

===Bolinas Community Public Utility District===
In 1967, the Bolinas Community Public Utility District was formed by the Marin County Board of Supervisors. It merged two local water districts, the Bolinas Beach Public Utility District which served the Big Mesa, and the Bolinas Public Utility District which served the Downtown and Little Mesa, with the Marin County Sanitary District #3, formed in 1908 to provide sewer service in the downtown. The BCPUD provides water service and solid waste pickup throughout Bolinas, and sewer service to the Downtown and Little Mesa.

In November 1971, the Bolinas Community Public Utility District instituted a moratorium on new water permits, which halted the construction of new homes. The moratorium was based on the limited local water supply during the summer months and in drought years, and also serves to limit new development in Bolinas. In 1990, the BCPUD enacted a moratorium on new sewer connections, to address the limited capacity of the sewage collection system. Many lots, especially on the Big Mesa, remain undeveloped.

In 2003, Bolinas voters adopted Measure G, authored by Bolinas artist Jane &quot;Dakar&quot; Blethen. The advisory measure called for the following language to be adopted as a policy of the Bolinas Community Public Utility District:

==Regional recreation and marine protected areas==
Besides the public access beach near the downtown area, there is a county park, Agate Beach, which contains extensive tide pools that are protected as part of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. The town also hosts the Marin-Bolinas Botanical Gardens, and borders on the Point Reyes National Seashore to the north. Alamere Falls, one of only two beach waterfalls in the continental U.S., is on the California Coastal Trail from Palomarin Trailhead at the end of Mesa Road.

Duxbury Reef State Marine Conservation Area lies offshore from Bolinas. Like an underwater park, this marine protected area helps conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.

==In popular culture==
Bolinas and its reclusive reputation are featured in the 1981 novel &quot;Ecotopia Emerging&quot; by Ernest Callenbach.

&quot;Wildflowers&quot;, a 1999 film starring Daryl Hannah, was partly filmed in Bolinas.

Stickers that say &quot;Radio Free Bolinas&quot; were subtly put on a couple of the Y-wing pilot helmets seen in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. Radio Free Bolinas was a pirate radio station that was founded in 1978, and was shut down by the FCC sometime after the station had a call from San Francisco, over 10 miles away and out of their broadcast range. This sticker was put on by the prop makers as they were likely in or around the area listening to the station while making the helmets.

<text>Corte Madera (; Spanish for &quot;Chop Wood&quot;) is an incorporated town in Marin County, California. Corte Madera is located south of San Rafael, at an elevation of 39 feet (12 m). The population was 10,222 at the 2020 census. The town was named after the Spanish imperative command &quot;chop wood&quot;, as the area was famous for producing redwood tree lumber which was used in the construction of the city of San Francisco.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which of it is land and of it (28.19%) is water.

==History==
The first post office in Corte Madera opened in 1878, and closed in 1880. The Adams post office opened in 1902, and changed its name later that year to Corte Madera. The name &quot;Adams&quot; honored Jerry Adams, its first postmaster. Corte Madera incorporated in 1916.

The town of Corte Madera is situated on a portion of Rancho Corte Madera del Presidio granted to John Reed in 1834 by Mexican Governor José Figueroa. Reed quickly took to the lumber industry, logging the area&#x27;s immense supply of redwoods and shipping the lumber to San Francisco by way of Corte Madera Creek — some of this wood was used to build the Presidio in San Francisco; the town&#x27;s growth continued.

In 1850, California joined the Union, and the Gold Rush, by then a year old, brought more settlers to the area. By 1875, the North Pacific Coast Railroad set its tracks through Corte Madera, allowing flatcars to haul lumber, and later, passenger trains to service commuters to and from San Francisco, aided in its early stages by the Sausalito ferry. A few of those commuters significantly influenced the formation of Old Town.

In 1885, a New England lawyer, Frank Morrison Pixley, was guaranteed a title for from Reed&#x27;s daughter, Hilarita. (Pixley later practiced law in San Francisco, became involved in local politics and founded an esteemed magazine called &quot;The Argonaut&quot;, whose writers included Mark Twain and Ambrose Bierce.) The Pixley family was credited with creating Corte Madera&#x27;s first subdivision and with developing downtown. The population continued to grow (eventually exploding after construction of the Golden Gate Bridge was completed in 1937).

The first business structure in Corte Madera was a hotel and tavern just south of the train station, built by Jerry Adams of Switzerland in 1898. The three-story building still exists today on First Street, between Corte Madera Avenue and Montecito Drive, and these days houses a beauty salon, an architectural sheet metal firm and a number of residential apartments. A smaller barn-like building constructed around that time behind the Adams&#x27;s hotel went through its evolution as a hardware store, a mattress place, an antique shop, a design studio, a gallery and a neighborhood video store. Today it is a textile arts studio and Swedish textile home products store.

Across from the railroad station, a huge barn was built in 1898, and was used as a livery stable, handy for horses to haul goods from nearby mines and for local freight delivery from the trains. In 1906, it then operated as Buckley &amp; Co. general store for the next 50 years. After renovations, the barn exists today at the corner of Tamalpais Drive and Serra Street as a luxurious spa and full-service beauty salon.

In 1905, Del Mahood came to Corte Madera to be the railroad agent and stationmaster. He was also a telegrapher and, along with his brother Foster, Del operated the local telephone agency, the post office and a sweets shop in their building next to the Episcopal Church. The Mahoods&#x27; building still stands, over a century later, on Redwood Avenue. Other buildings remain from that era: the dramatic triangular-peaked Holy Innocents church built in 1901 at the northeastern corner of Old Corte Madera Square still stands, as does the Presbyterian Church built on the old road above the square around the same time. Across from the Holy Innocents Episcopal Church, two stucco structures were built in the early 1900s. That property, featuring a creamery and an automobile repair shop, now exists as a yoga studio. Most of the remaining buildings around the historical village square went up in the 1920s and 1930s.

The square around the train station was the original center of Corte Madera, around which everything bloomed. Established in 1916 and preserved by the Women&#x27;s Club, Railroad Park is located in the northwest quadrant of the old train station square. It was renamed Menke Park in the early 1950s after the town leased the property from the railroad and took over maintenance of the land. Several homes constructed during that time pay tribute to the New England-influenced architecture of the late 1880s, and can still be seen in the Old Square&#x27;s surrounding neighborhoods.

The hill at the base of Corte Madera is called Christmas Tree Hill because the early street lights (and later, the lighted homes) on the hill leading up to Mt. Tamalpais create the shape of a lighted Christmas tree.

==Community festivals==

The Fourth of July celebration—joining Corte Madera and its &quot;twin city&quot;, Larkspur—draws thousands of spectators and residents from all over the Bay Area. The event includes a parade through Old Town, as well as festivities and a picnic in the nearby Town Park. During the Parade, winning baseball teams are in the parade, such as the minors Indians, in 2015

From the 1950s until the early 1970s, Holy Innocents Episcopal Parish held an Epiphany pageant with all of the church&#x27;s younger members costumed and singing, followed by a Christmas tree bonfire in the triangle outside of the church. Residents would drop off their trees after Christmas and the fire department would supervise the burning on the twelfth day of Christmas (Epiphany). In some years, the church handed out candles to attendees. The rector of the church, Reverend Todd Ewald, chose to discontinue the bonfire in the early 1970s, saying he wanted to do it voluntarily before the growing environmental movement forced the change.

<doc id="107720" wikidata="Q2104029" url="?curid=107720" title="Dillon Beach, California">
<text>Dillon Beach is a census-designated place (CDP) in Marin County, California, United States. It is located west of Tomales, at an elevation of . The population was 246 at the 2020 census. Dillon Beach was named after the founder, George Dillon, who settled there in 1858. The area includes a public access beach, as well as a private beach resort, the only private beach in California. While Dillon Beach cannot legally claim exclusive ownership over the sandy area below the high tide mark due to California’s public trust doctrine, it can market itself as having a “private beach” based on ownership of adjacent lands and management practices that restrict public access. Thus, while technically incorrect in claiming exclusivity over all aspects of the beach itself, they leverage their control over entry points and surrounding properties to create an impression of privacy.
==Geography==
Dillon Beach is located at Bodega Bay (near the mouth of Tomales Bay), at .

The Estero de San Antonio State Marine Recreational Management Area is a marine protected area located north of Dillon Beach. Like an underwater park, this marine protected area helps conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land.

==History==

The Coast Miwok people had a presence in the area around Dillon Beach long before Europeans arrived in the Americas. It is thought that a few of their villages were located within the greater Dillon Beach area, including one around the feature known locally as the Sand Point.

In the 1850s, local historical figure Tom Wood operated in the area, employing the natives in harvesting of grain to be milled nearby. He would attempt to ensure that they were not taken advantage of by the British, French, or American traders who frequented the coast. Hides and tallow were traded for various manufactured goods, among them whiskey. Despite Wood&#x27;s efforts, many of them succumbed to alcoholism. Today, while a few individuals claim descent from the local Coast Miwoks, no full-blooded members are alive. Tom&#x27;s Point, immediately south of Dillon Beach on the eastern shore of the bay, is named for Tom Wood, and Wood resided there with the small village he ingratiated himself into.

Irishman George Dillon and wife Mathilda arrived at what is now Dillon Beach from the eastern U.S. in 1868. When his friends and family showed interest in the area, he thought to capitalize on it; in 1888, he built an 11 bedroom hotel, restaurant, and general store. This is the Dillon Beach Resort in operation today. Visitors would explore the area on their way up the coast toward the redwood forests, strolling the beach, fishing, or digging clams from the nearby clam bars of Tomales Bay.

In 1903, Dillon sold out to John Keegan with the agreement that the beach would always be named Dillon Beach. Keegan also built cottages, one of which still stands along the road to the beach. Keegan ran a stagecoach from Dillon Beach to Tomales where it met the train.

Keegan sold the holdings to the California Eucalyptus Plantation Company in 1911. They planted the area with eucalyptus trees, a few of which still stand, but continued to operate the resort, and redoubled these efforts as the eucalyptus crop proved to warp easily and was effectively worthless. Under the subsidiary of the Dillon Beach Company, they operated the resort, ferried guests from the train in Tomales, ran a charter boat, and created Portola Beach, a subdivision along Cliff Street. Try as they might, their Dillon Beach operations were failing.

When regular visitors and Woodland ranchers Sylvester and Carrie Lawson offered to lease the property, the California Eucalyptus Plantation Company promptly agreed. Different portions of the business and land were leased or purchased by the Lawson family, and by 1942 Dillon Beach was firmly in Lawson hands. Sylvester and Carrie&#x27;s older son, Howard, and his wife, Winifred, owned and ran the resort, while the younger son, Walter, and his wife, Nita, ran the southern side of the property, operating it as a ranch and opening Lawsons Landing on it. The Landing is operated by Walter&#x27;s descendants to this day as a campground with a store and boating access to Tomales Bay.

During World War II, fears of a Japanese invasion of the West Coast were considered well founded, especially along sparsely populated Marin and Sonoma counties, where enemy forces could conceivably make landfall and prepare for a larger invasion of San Francisco Bay. The military commandeered many cottages and monitored the water from outposts on the surrounding hills supported by ground patrols. The sand dunes on the Lawsons Landing property were also a site for rifle and grenade practice, and the Lawson family recalls at least one instance of an armored vehicle&#x27;s .50 caliber machine gun being fired around their cows, resulting in a tense conversation between soldiers and ranchers. One soldier reportedly sighted a Japanese submarine off the beach, prompting the garrison to scramble to nearby Marshall to requisition its civilian fishing boats for use in a counterattack, several of which were run by their respective owners. It took several hours to coordinate the operation, and once the soldiers finally arrived at the area of the supposed sighting, armed only with small arms, the submarine had departed, if it had been there at all.

The College of the Pacific operated from 1933 until some time in the 1980s. It stood between Portola Beach and Lawsons Landing, offering a hands-on experience for a small number of marine biology students. The concrete foundation is all that remains today, hinting at what was there before to passersby today.

During the 1960s, Oceana Marin was developed north of town by John Keegan&#x27;s grandson, James Keegan of Wells Fargo Bank and Henry Trione of Sonoma County Mortgage. Fancy modern coastal houses were built on the hillsides overlooking the quaint town of small cottages, giving it a unique appeal.

<text>Fairfax is an incorporated town in Marin County, California, United States. Fairfax is located west-northwest of San Rafael, at an elevation of . The population was 7,605 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The Coast Miwok Native Americans occupied stretches along local creeks, spring and seep areas; moreover, prehistoric habitations were usually chosen near permanent and seasonal drainages, typically along flat ridges and terraces.

The town was named for Lord Charles Snowden Fairfax. In 1861, Fairfax was the site of the last political duel in California. Daniel Showalter and Charles W. Piercy, both former assemblymen in the state legislature, decided to settle a political dispute at the home of Lord Fairfax, a mutual friend. Although Fairfax provided lunch to both men and tried to talk them out of it, they eventually headed to an open field nearby and dueled, with Showalter killing Piercy.

The first post office opened in 1910. Fairfax became an incorporated town in 1931.

On May 16, 1946, a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber, crashed on White&#x27;s Hill just west of Fairfax.

Irving Berlin used to serenade from a treetop piano at Pastori&#x27;s Hotel, formerly Bird&#x27;s Nest Glen, the home of Lord Charles Snowden Fairfax, and later known as the Marin Town &amp; Country Club.

The popularity of outdoor hot tubs soared after Al Garvey designed his own redwood hot tub in July 1966, installed outside Al and Barbara Garvey&#x27;s home on Scenic Road on the hillside leading up to Fairfax Manor. The Garvey hot tub was used by hundreds of people in the first few months, including jazz musician John Handy, eccentric architect Roger Somers and sex worker/feminist Margo St. James. Barbara Garvey said, &quot;We decided to make the hot tub a social enterprise and started throwing parties.&quot; Soon, many others had hot tubs of their own. The social fashion of hot-tubbing with friends became connected with Marin County culture and style.

Fairfax is a popular destination for mountain bikers and road cyclists due to its proximity to Mount Tamalpais.

<text>Inverness is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in western Marin County, California, United States. It is located on the southwest shore of Tomales Bay northwest of Point Reyes Station and about by road northwest of San Francisco, at an elevation of . In the 2020 census, the population was 1,379. The community was named by a Scottish landowner after Inverness in Scotland.

== Community ==
Inverness is located on the west shore of Tomales Bay, which runs southeast along the line of the San Andreas Fault. Surrounded by Point Reyes National Seashore, it is primarily a residential community, with little industry other than tourism. It has a small downtown area with a general store, post office, library, two restaurants, one gift shop and a coffee shop. A third restaurant is located a short way north of downtown. There are also a number of hotels and inns spread throughout the town. 

One aspect of the town is a concentration of recreational (and some commercial) boating. There is a small public marina, a few private piers, and the Inverness Yacht Club.

Portions of the John Carpenter film &quot;The Fog&quot; as well as most of his film &quot;Village of the Damned&quot; were shot in and around Inverness. In 1970, American singer and songwriter Jesse Colin Young moved his home and recording studio to Inverness. In 1993, Young and his wife Connie founded Ridgetop Music, a label based out of their home in Inverness.

== History==
The town is about northeast of Drakes Bay on the Pacific Ocean, named after Sir Francis Drake, who explored the coast in the 16th century. Although Drake&#x27;s official log was lost, the ship&#x27;s doctor&#x27;s log described landing in an area that reminded him of the White Cliffs of Dover. Drakes Bay is backed by similar-looking cliffs, leading many to believe this is where the ship landed.

The region became the property of James Shafter, who began to develop the property in the 1890s. It became a summer resort where people from San Francisco and Oakland came to camp, hike and swim in Tomales Bay. Many built small summer cabins that still exist today. Small steamboats took day trippers down the bay to secluded beaches. They left from Brock Schreiber&#x27;s boathouse, which has been preserved and is a prominent local landmark with its prominent sign &quot;Launch for Hire&quot;.

The first post office opened in 1897.

In 1995, Inverness Ridge was the site of the Mt. Vision Fire, which burned a large area of Point Reyes National Seashore and a number of homes built on the ridge. The town itself was threatened but was saved by helicopters dipping water from Tomales Bay to drop on the Bishop pine forest between the town and the burning ridgetop.

<text>Lucas Valley-Marinwood is a census-designated place (CDP) in Marin County, California, United States. It includes the neighborhoods of Lucas Valley and Marinwood. As of the 2020 census, the population was 6,259.

==History==

James Miller, of Irish descent, came overland to California in 1844 with the Stephens–Townsend–Murphy Party and in April 1845 arrived in San Rafael. In 1846 he purchased of land from Timothy Murphy, grantee of Rancho San Pedro, Santa Margarita y Las Gallinas. The land encompassed present-day Marinwood and a creek which was later named Miller Creek. He rebuilt an old adobe on a hill where the Miller Creek condominiums are located and called it Miller Hall. By 1862 Miller had 10 children, and in 1864 he donated a -acre site next to Miller Creek to have the Dixie School built upon it. The building still stands but has been relocated in front of Miller Creek Middle school on Las Gallinas Avenue. It is on the National Register of Historic Places.

James Miller died in 1890. The ranch he owned at the time was eventually sold to the Sequeira family in 1935. The family tore down Miller Hall later that year. A portion of the Miller land was sold to Anthony Faustine (A.F.) Silveira, who had leased the property from 1900 to 1935. Silveira built his own home and dairy facility in 1935 on the east side of what is now the 101 Highway. Silveira, the founding president of Marin Dairymen&#x27;s Milk Co. Ltd. aka Marin-Dell, died in a ranch accident in 1937. His family continued the ranching operation, which still exists.

Lucas Valley was named after John Lucas, a 19th-century rancher and nephew of Timothy Murphy (not related to George Lucas).

In the 1950s and 1960s, suburbia came to Marinwood. It was brought partly on the shoulders of modernist builder/developer Joseph Eichler. His highly recognizable and stylish homes can be found throughout Lucas Valley and Eastern Marinwood. The Lucas Valley community center and pool were also constructed by Eichler as a centerpiece of the neighborhood.

The original subdivision of Marinwood consisted of streets to the north of Miller Creek Road and featured a blend of suburban single story ranch-style homes and two-story Cape Cod-inspired homes. The streets were named so that all the names ended in &quot;-stone&quot;. In alphabetical order, they are Adobestone, Blackstone, Cobblestone, Deepstone, Emerystone, Flagstone, Heatherstone, Johnstone, Millstone, Opalstone, Peachstone, Rhinestone, Unionstone, and Windstone.

The second subdivision was smaller, built to the south of Miller Creek Road, featuring the same mix of ranch- and Cape Cod-style homes. The streets were named with &quot;-wood&quot; as their suffix. They are Pinewood and Quietwood.

A later development was the area that became known as Lower Lucas Valley. This development featured the Eichler-style homes, as opposed to the Marinwood mix. The streets of lower Lucas Valley were named so their names all ended in berry. The streets are, in alphabetical order: Appleberry, Blackberry, Cedarberry, Danberry, Elderberry, Flaxberry, Greenberry, Huckleberry, Idylberry, Juniperberry, Kernberry, Loganberry, Mulberry, Newberry.

The final development was the area up the valley to the west, known as Upper Lucas Valley, and also featured Eichler-style homes. The streets of this area are all named for famous mountains, such as Mt. Shasta, Mt. Rainier, Mt. Whitney, etc.

In 1977, George Lucas purchased west of Marinwood, which he subsequently refashioned into Skywalker Ranch. Geographically, Skywalker Ranch is located on the western side of the Big Rock Ridge and is not part of the Lucas Valley–Marinwood CDP.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land. It is bordered to the north by Novato and to the south by San Rafael. The U.S. Route 101 freeway forms the eastern limit of the CDP, and Lucas Valley Road is the southern border. The CDP extends west up Lucas Valley road to the height of land at Big Rock.

<text>Mill Valley is a city in Marin County, California, United States, located about north of San Francisco via the Golden Gate Bridge and from Napa Valley. The population was 14,231 at the 2020 census.

Mill Valley is located on the western and northern shores of Richardson Bay, and the eastern slopes of Mount Tamalpais. Beyond the flat coastal area and marshlands, it occupies narrow wooded canyons, mostly of second-growth redwoods, on the southeastern slopes of Mount Tamalpais. The Mill Valley 94941 ZIP Code also includes the following adjacent unincorporated communities: Almonte, Alto, Homestead Valley, Tamalpais Valley, and Strawberry. The Muir Woods National Monument is also located just outside the city limits.

==History==

===Coast Miwok===
The first people known to inhabit Marin County, the Coast Miwok, arrived approximately 6,500 years ago. The territory of the Coast Miwok encompasses all of Marin County, north to Bodega Bay and southern Sonoma County. More than 600 village sites have been identified, including 14 sites in the Mill Valley area. Nearby archaeological discoveries include rock carvings and grain-grinding sites on Ring Mountain. The pre-Missionization population of the Coast Miwok is estimated to have been between 1,500 (Alfred L. Kroeber&#x27;s estimate for the year 1770 AD) and 2,000 (Sherburne F. Cook&#x27;s estimate for the same year). The pre-Spanish era Coast Miwok population may have even been as high as 5,000. Cook speculated that by 1848, their population had decreased to merely 300, from foreign disease-exposure and Spanish violence, and was down to 60 by 1880. As of 2011, there are over 1,000 registered members of the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, which includes both the Coast Miwok and the Southern Pomo, all of whom can date their ancestry back to 14 survivors as original tribal ancestors.

In Mill Valley, on Locust Avenue (between Sycamore and Walnut avenues), there is now a metal plaque set in the sidewalk in the area believed to be the birthplace of Chief Marin in 1781; the plaque was dedicated on May 8, 2009. The village site was first identified by Nels Nelson in 1907, and his excavation revealed tools, burials and food debris, among other things, just beyond the driveway of a residence on Locust Ave. At that time, the mound was high. Shell mounds have been discovered in areas by streams and along Richardson Bay, including in the Strawberry and Almonte neighborhoods.

Another famous Mill Valley site was in the Manzanita area, underneath the Fireside Inn, previously known as the Manzanita Roadhouse (and the Manzanita Hotel, Emil Plasberg&#x27;s Top Rail, and Top Rail Tavern); the bulk of such establishments were notoriously regarded during the time of United States Prohibition-era gin joints and brothels. The Manzanita was located near the intersection of U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1. Built in 1916, the &quot;Blind Pig&quot; roadhouse was located outside of the dry 
laws that were enforced more strictly within the city itself.

In 1776, with the foundation of Mission San Francisco de Asís (commonly known as Mission Dolores), the Coast Miwok of southern Marin began to slowly enter the mission; first, those from Sausalito came, followed by those from areas now known as Mill Valley, Belvedere, Tiburón and Bolinas. They called themselves the &quot;Huimen&quot; people. At the mission, they were taught the Catholic faith, lost all of their known freedom, and over three-quarters died as a result of exposure to foreign diseases, to which the Native Americans lacked immunity. Nearly just as many people died from violent acts perpetrated by the Spaniards and Europeans. As a result of the high death rate at Mission Dolores, it was decided to build a new Mission San Rafael, built in 1817. Over 200 surviving Coast Miwok were taken there from Mission Dolores and Mission San Jose—including the 17 survivors of the Huimen Coast Miwok of the Richardson Bay area California Missions.

===Early settlers===
By 1834, the Mission era had ended and California was under the control of the Mexican government. They took Miwok ancestral lands, divided them and gave them to Mexican soldiers or relatives who had connections with the Mexican governor. The huge tracts of land, called ranchos by the Mexican settlers, or Californios, soon covered the area. The Miwoks who had not died or fled were often employed under a state of indentured servitude to the California land grant owners. That same year, the governor of Alta California, José Figueroa, awarded to John T. Reed the first land grant in Marin, Rancho Corte Madera del Presidio. Just west of that, Rancho Saucelito was transferred to William A. Richardson in 1838 after being originally awarded to Nicolas Galindo in 1835. William Richardson also married a well-connected woman; both he and Reed were originally from Europe. Richardson&#x27;s name was later applied to Richardson Bay, an arm of the San Francisco Bay that brushes up against the eastern edge of Mill Valley. The Richardson rancho contained everything south and west of the Corte Madera and Larkspur areas with the Pacific Ocean, San Francisco Bay, and Richardson Bay as the other three borders. The former encompassed what is now southern Corte Madera, the Tiburon Peninsula, and Strawberry Point.

In 1836, John Reed married Hilaria Sanchez, the daughter of a commandante in the San Francisco Presidio. He built the first sawmill in the county on the Cascade Creek (now Old Mill Park) in the mid-1830s on Richardson&#x27;s rancho and settled near what is now Locke Lane and LaGoma Avenue. The mill cut wood for the San Francisco Presidio. He raised cattle and horses and had a brickyard and stone quarry. Reed also did brisk businesses in hunting, skins, tallow, and other products until his death in 1843 at 38 years of age. Richardson sold butter, milk and beef to San Francisco during the Gold Rush. Shortly thereafter, he made several poor investments and wound up massively in debt to many creditors. On top of losing his Mendocino County rancho, he was forced to deed the Rancho Saucelito to his wife, Maria Antonia Martinez, daughter of the commandante of the Presidio, in order to protect her. The rest of the rancho, including the part of what is now Mill Valley that did not already belong to Reed&#x27;s heirs, was given to his administrator Samuel Reading Throckmorton. At his death in 1856 at 61 years old, Richardson was almost destitute.

Throckmorton came to San Francisco in 1850 as an agent for an eastern mining business before working for Richardson. As payment of a debt, Throckmorton acquired a large portion of Rancho Saucelito in 1853–54 and built his own rancho, &quot;The Homestead,&quot; on what is now Linden Lane and Montford Avenue. The descendants of ranch superintendent Jacob Gardner continue to be active in Marin. Some of the rest of his land was leased out for dairy farming to Portuguese settlers. A majority of the immigrants came from the Azores. Those who were unsuccessful at gold mining came north to the Marin Headlands and later brought their families. In Mill Valley, Ranch &quot;B&quot; is one of the few remaining dairy farm buildings and is located near the parking lot at the Tennessee Valley trailhead. Throckmorton also suffered devastating financial problems before his death in 1887. His surname would later be applied to one of the major thoroughfares in Mill Valley. Richardson and Reed had never formalized the boundary lines separating their ranchos. Richardson&#x27;s heirs successfully sued Reed&#x27;s heirs in 1860 claiming the mill was built on their property. The border was officially marked as running along the Arroyo Corte Madera del Presidio along present-day Miller Avenue. Everything to the east of the creek was Reed property, and everything to the west was Richardson land. It was Richardson&#x27;s territory that would soon become part of Mill Valley when Throckmorton&#x27;s daughter Suzanna was forced to relinquish several thousand acres to the San Francisco Savings &amp; Union Bank to satisfy a debt of $100,000 against the estate in 1889.

In 1873, San Francisco physician Dr. John Cushing discovered 320 &quot;lost&quot; acres between the Reed and Richardson boundaries between present-day Corte Madera Avenue, across the creek, and into West Blithedale Canyon. Using the Homestead Act he petitioned the government and managed to acquire the land. Before his death in 1879 he had built a sanitarium in the peaceful canyon. In Sausalito the North Pacific Coast Railroad had laid down tracks to a station near present-day Highway 101 at Strawberry. Seeing the financial advantages of a railroad his descendants then turned the hospital into the Blithedale Hotel after the land title was finally granted in 1884. The sanitarium was enlarged, cottages were built up along the property, and horse-drawn carriages were purchased to pick up guests at the Alto station. Within a few years, several other summer resort hotels had cropped up in the canyon including the Abbey, the Eastland, and the Redwood Lodge. Fishing, hunting, hiking, swimming, horseback riding, and other activities increased in popularity as people came to the area as vacationers or moved in and commuted to San Francisco for work. Meanwhile, Reed&#x27;s mill deforested much of the surrounding redwoods, meaning that most of the redwoods growing today are second- or third-growth. The King family (King Street) owned property near the Cushing land. One of its buildings was a small adobe house which is believed to have predated the King farm. The Blithedale Hotel used it as a milk house. The adobe structure is still standing and connected to a house on West Blithedale Avenue; it is the oldest structure in Mill Valley.

The San Francisco Savings &amp; Union Bank organized the Tamalpais Land &amp; Water Company in 1889 as an agency for disposing of the Richardson land gained from the Throckmorton debt. The board of directors was President Joseph Eastland, Secretary Louis L. Janes (Janes Street), Thomas Magee (Magee Avenue), Albert Miller (Miller Avenue), and Lovell White (Lovell Avenue). Eastland, who had been president of the North Pacific Coast Railroad in 1877 and retained an interest, pushed to extend the railroad into the area in 1889. Though Reed, Richardson, and the Cushings were crucial to bringing people to the Mill Valley area, it was Eastland who really propelled the area and set the foundation for the city today. He had founded power companies all around the San Francisco Bay area, was on the board of several banks, and had control of several commercial companies. The Tamalpais Land &amp; Water Co. hired Michael M. O&#x27;Shaughnessy, already a noted engineer to lay out roads, pedestrian paths, and step-systems for what the developers hoped would become a new city. He also built the Cascade Dam &amp; Reservoir for water supply, and set aside land plots for churches, schools, and parks. 

On May 31, 1890, nearly 3,000 people attended The Tamalpais Land &amp; Water Co. land auction near the now-crumbling sawmill. More than were sold that day in the areas of present-day Throckmorton, Cascade, Lovell, Summit, and Miller Avenues and extending to the west side of Corte Madera Avenue. By 1892, there were two schools in the area and a few churches. The auction also brought into Mill Valley architects, builders, and craftsmen. Harvey A. Klyce was one of the most prominent of the architects and designed many private homes and public buildings in the area, including the Masonic Lodge in 1904. Before his death in 1894, Eastland built a large summer home, &quot;Burlwood&quot;, constructed on Throckmorton Avenue in 1892 that still stands though much of the original land has been parceled off. Burlwood was the first home in the town to have electricity, and when telephones were installed only he and Mrs. Cushing, the owner of the Blithedale Hotel, had service. After the land auctions the area was known as both &quot;Eastland&quot; and &quot;Mill Valley&quot;.

Janes, by then the resident director of Tamalpais Land &amp; Water Co. (and eventually the city&#x27;s first town clerk), and Sidney B. Cushing, president of the San Rafael Gas &amp; Electric Co. set out to bring a railroad up Mt. Tamalpais. The Mt. Tamalpais Scenic Railway opened in 1896 (with Cushing as president) and ran from the town center (present-day Lytton Square) all the way to the summit. In 1907, the railroad added a branch line into &quot;Redwood Canyon&quot;, and in 1908, the canyon became Muir Woods, a national monument. The railroad built the Muir Inn (with a fine restaurant) and overnight cabins for visitors. The Mt. Tamalpais &amp; Muir Woods Scenic Railway, &quot;The Crookedest Railroad in the World&quot; and its unique Gravity Cars brought thousands of tourists to the Tavern of Tamalpais on the mountain summit (built in 1896, rebuilt after the 1923 fire, and razed in 1950 by the California State Parks), the West Point Inn (built in 1904, by the scenic railway, operated commercially until 1943, closed briefly and then run by volunteers to the present day), and the Muir Woods Inn (burned in 1913, rebuilt in 1914, destroyed in 1930). The tracks were removed in 1930 after the 1929 fire. This occurred as a result of a drop in ridership due to increased usage of automobiles rather than trains for recreation and construction of the Panoramic Highway and connecting road to Ridgecrest in 1929. Rails connected Mill Valley with neighboring cities and commuters to San Francisco via ferries.

===Incorporation through WWII===

By 1900, the population was nearing 900 and the locals pushed out the Tamalpais Land &amp; Water Co. in favor of incorporation. Organizations and clubs cropped up including the Outdoor Art Club (1902) (organized by Laura Lyon White), Masonic Lodge (1903) which celebrated its centennial in 2003 and the Dipsea Race (1905), the latter marking its 100th anniversary in 2010. The second big population boom came after the 1906 Great earthquake. While much of San Francisco and Marin County was devastated, many fled to Mill Valley and most never left. In that year alone the population grew to over 1,000 permanent residents. Creeks were bridged over or dammed, more roads laid down and oiled, and cement sidewalks poured. Tamalpais High School opened in 1908, the first city hall was erected in 1908, and Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s library in 1910. The Post Office opened under the name &quot;Eastland&quot;, however after many objections it was changed to &quot;Mill Valley&quot; in 1904. The very first Mountain Play was performed at the Mountain Theater on Mt. Tam in 1913.

By the 1920s, most roads were paved over, mail delivery was in full swing, and the population was at its highest at more than 2,500 citizens. Mill Valley Italian settlers made wine during Prohibition, while some local bar owners made bootleg whiskey under the dense foliage around the local creeks. January 1922 saw the first of several years of snow in Marin County, coating Mt. Tam white. Two years later the Sulphur Springs, a natural hot spring where locals could revive their lagging spirits, was covered over and turned in the playground of the Old Mill Elementary School.1929 was a year of great change for Mill Valley. The Great Fire raged for several days in early July and nearly destroyed the fledgling city. It ravaged much of Mt. Tam (including the Tavern and 117 homes) and the city itself was spared only by a change in wind direction. In October of that year, the Mt. Tamalpais and Muir Woods Scenic Railway ran for the last time. The fire caused great devastation to tourism and tourist destinations, but the railroads were also crushed by the automobile. Panoramic Highway, running between Mill Valley and Stinson Beach was built in 1929–1930. The stock market crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression crippled what little railroad tourism there was to the point where the tracks were eventually taken up in 1931.

During the Great Depression, many famous local landmarks were constructed with the help of the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps, including the Mead Theater at Tam High (named after school board Trustee Ernest Mead), the Mountain Theater rock seating, and the Golden Gate Bridge in 1934–1937. The latter event suspended ferry commuting between Marin and the city from 1941 through 1970 and helped increase the Marin population. With the demise of the railroads came the introduction of local bus service. Greyhound moved into the former train depot in Lytton Square in October 1940. In Sausalito, Marinship brought over 75,000 people to Marin, many of whom moved to Mill Valley permanently. At the height of the War, nearly 400 locals were fighting, including many volunteer firemen and government officials. By 1950, 1 in 10 Mill Valleyans were living in a &quot;Goheen Home&quot;. George C. Goheen built the so-called &quot;defense homes&quot; for defense workers throughout the 1940s and 1950s in the Alto neighborhood.

===1950s to present===

 With a population just over 7,000 by 1950, Mill Valley was still relatively rural. Workers commuted to San Francisco on the Greyhound bus when the streets were not flooding in heavy rain, and there still were not any traffic lights. The military built the Mill Valley Air Force Station to protect the area during the Korean War. In 1956, a group of Beat poets and writers lived briefly in the Perry house, most notably Jack Kerouac and San Francisco Renaissance Beat poet Gary Snyder. The house and its land is now owned by the Marin County Open Space District. By the beginning of the 1960s, however, the population swelled. The Mill Valley Fall Arts Festival became a permanent annual event and the old Carnegie library was replaced with an award-winning library at 375 Throckmorton Ave. Designed by architect Donn Emmons, the new library was formally dedicated on September 18, 1966.

The 1970s saw a change in attitude and population. Mill Valley became an area associated with great wealth, with many people making their millions in San Francisco and moving north. New schools and neighborhoods cropped up, though the city maintained its defense of redwoods and protected open space. Cascade Dam, built in 1893, was closed in 1972 and drained four years later in an attempt to curb the &quot;hordes&quot; of young people using the reservoir for nude sunbathing and swimming. Youth subculture would come under attack again in 1974 when the City Council banned live music, first at the Sweetwater and later at the Old Mill Tavern, both now defunct. In 1977, the Lucretia Hanson Little History Room in the library opened and became the base of operations for the Mill Valley Historical Society. Marin County was hit with one of the worst droughts on record beginning in 1976 and peaking in 1977, brought on by a combination of several seasons of low rainfall and a refusal to import water from the Russian River, instead relying solely on rain water from Mt. Tam and the West Marin watersheds to fill the then-six reservoirs. By June 1977, the County managed to pipe in water from the Sacramento River Delta, staving off disaster. The rainfall during the winter of 1977-78 was one of the heaviest on record. The Mill Valley Film Festival, now part of the California Film Institute, began in 1978 at the Sequoia Theatre.

The 1980s and 1990s saw the decline of small businesses in Mill Valley. Local establishments like Lockwood&#x27;s Pharmacy closed in 1981 after running almost continuously for 86 years. Old Mill Tavern, O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s, and the Unknown Museum shut their doors, as did Red Cart Market and Tamalpais Hardware. In their places came boutiques, upscale clothing stores, coffee shops, art galleries, and gourmet grocery stores. Downtown Plaza and Lytton Square were remodeled to fit the new attitude. The population in the city alone swelled over 13,000 and many of the old, narrow, winding streets grew clogged with traffic congestion. The Public Library expanded with a new Children&#x27;s Room, a downstairs Fiction Room, and Internet computers. It also joined MARINet, a consortium of all the public libraries in Marin, to allow patrons greater access to information. MARINet now has an online catalogue of all the materials, both physical and electronic, in the Marin public libraries, which patrons can order, pick up, and drop off materials at any of the participating libraries. The Old Mill also got a facelift; it was rebuilt to the same specifications as the original in 1991. The 1990s also saw another influx of affluence. Many new homeowners gutted homes built in the 19th and early 20th centuries or tore them down altogether.

The dawn of the new millennium brought reflection on the past, as the city celebrated 100 years of incorporation. Soon after Mill Valley got its brand new Community Center at 180 Camino Alto, adjacent to Mill Valley Middle School.

On January 31, 2008, Mill Valley&#x27;s sewage treatment plant spilled 2.45 million gallons of sewage into the San Francisco Bay. This marked the second such spill in Mill Valley within a week (the previous one spilled 2.7 million gallons), and the most recent of several that occurred in Marin County in early 2008. Mill Valley&#x27;s treatment plant attributed the spills to &quot;human error&quot;. The spills caused distress in Mill Valley&#x27;s administrative government, which remains outspoken about &quot;dedicating itself to the protection of air quality, waste reduction, water and energy conservation, and the protection of wildlife and habitat&quot; in Mill Valley.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau the city has a total area of , of which is land and of (1.74%) water.

The Mill Valley 94941 area lies between Mt. Tamalpais on the west, the city of Tiburon on the east, the City of Corte Madera on the north, and the Golden Gate National Recreational Area (GGNRA) on the south. Two streams flow from the slopes of Mt. Tamalpais through Mill Valley to the bay: the Arroyo Corte Madera del Presidio; and Cascade Creek. Mill Valley is surrounded by hundreds of acres of state, federal, and county park lands. In addition, there are many municipally maintained open-space reserves, parks, and coastal habitats which, when taken together, ensconce Mill Valley in a natural wilderness.

Mill Valley and the Homestead Valley Land Trust maintains many minimally disturbed wildland areas and preserves which are open to the public from sunrise to dusk every day. Several nature trails allow access as well as providing gateway access to neighboring state and federal park lands, and the Mt. Tamalpais Watershed wildland on the broad eastern face of Mt. Tamalpais that overlooks Mill Valley. These are undeveloped natural areas and contain many species of wild animals, including some large predators like the coyote, the bobcat, and the cougar.

===Climate===

Mill Valley has a mild Mediterranean climate which results in relatively wet winters and very dry summers. Winter lows rarely drop below freezing and summer highs rarely peak with 90% of the annual rain falling in November through March. Wind speeds average lower than national averages in winter months and higher in summer, and often become quite gusty in the canyon regions of town. California coastal fog often affects Mill Valley, making relative humidity highly variable. The wetter winter months tend to make for a more consistent daily relative humidity around 70–90% (slightly higher than US averages). During the summer months, however, while the morning fog often keeps morning humidity normal, in a typical 70–80% range, by afternoon after the fog burns off, the humidity regularly plummets to around 30% as one would expect in this dry seasonal climate. 
Mill Valley is also affected by microclimate conditions in the several box canyons with steep north-facing slopes and dense forests which span the southern and western city limits, which, along with the coastal fog, all conspire to make many of the dense forested regions of Mill Valley noticeably cooler and moister, on average, than other regions of town. This microclimate is what makes for the favorable ecology required by the Coastal Redwood forests which still cover much of the town and surrounding area, and have played such a pivotal role throughout the history of Mill Valley.

==Government==

===Federal and state===

In the United States House of Representatives, Mill Valley is in . From 2008 to 2012, Huffman represented Marin County in the California State Assembly.

In the California State Legislature, Mill Valley is in:
* .

According to the California Secretary of State, as of February 10, 2019, Mill Valley has 10,189 registered voters. Of those, 6,270 (61.5%) are registered Democrats, 965 (9.5%) are registered Republicans, and 2,605 (25.6%) have declined to state a political party.

==Cityscape==
The combination of Mill Valley&#x27;s idyllic location nestled beneath Mount Tamalpais coupled with its relative ease of access to nearby San Francisco has made it a popular home for many high-income commuters. Over the last 30 years, following a trend that is endemic throughout the Bay Area, home prices have climbed in Mill Valley (the median price for a single-family home was in excess of $1.5 million as of 2005), which has had the effect of pushing out some residents who can no longer afford to live in the area. This trend has also transformed Mill Valley&#x27;s commercial activity, with nationally recognized music store Village Music having closed, then replaced in 2008 by more commercial establishments.

In July 2005, CNN/Money and &quot;Money&quot; magazine ranked Mill Valley tenth on its list of the 100 Best Places to Live in the United States. In 2007, MSN and &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked Mill Valley seventy-third on its &quot;Most expensive zip codes in America&quot; list.

While Mill Valley has retained elements of its earlier artistic culture through galleries, festivals, and performances, its stock of affordable housing has diminished, forcing some residents to leave the area. This trend has also affected some of the city&#x27;s well-known cultural centers like Village Music and the Sweetwater Saloon. As of April 2007, only one affordable housing project was underway: an initiative to renovate and expand a century old but now abandoned local landmark roadhouse and saloon called the Fireside Inn. This renovation was completed in the fall of 2008 and provided around 50 low-income apartments, with around 30 dedicated to low-income seniors and the remainder going to low-income families.

===Neighborhoods and unincorporated areas===
Strawberry is an unincorporated census-designated place to the east of the City of Mill Valley. The other CDP with a Mill Valley mailing address is Tamalpais-Homestead Valley. Smaller unincorporated areas include Alto and Almonte. Muir Beach is in the Mill Valley School District, but it is in the Sausalito mailing area.

===City recreational parks===

Mill Valley maintains many recreational parks which often contain playgrounds, wooded trails and other designated areas specifically designed for playing various sports.

==Education==
===Public schools===

Public schools are managed by the Mill Valley School District. There are five elementary schools and one middle school, Mill Valley Middle School, a four-time winner of the California Distinguished School Award. The local high school, Tamalpais High School, is part of the Tamalpais Union High School District, whose five campuses serve central and southern Marin County. North Bridge Academy, a private school located in downtown Mill Valley, serves 2nd - 8th grade students with dyslexia. Marin Horizon School is an independent school serving students in grades PK-8. Founded in 1977, the school enrolls 296 students.

===Mill Valley Public Library===

The municipal library overlooks Old Mill Park and provides many picturesque reading locations, as well as free computer and Internet access. The Mill Valley library first digitized its vast holdings under the stewardship of Thelma Weber Percy, who was determined to see the Mill Valley Public Library come into the computer age. Recently they have begun offering Museum Passes to 94941 residents for free entry to Bay Area museums. As part of the City of Mill Valley&#x27;s decision to &quot;go Green&quot;, the library has a Sustainability Collection with books and DVDs with information about how to become more environmentally friendly.

The Mill Valley Public Library is also home to the Lucretia Hanson Little History Room, which has thousands of books, photographs, newspapers, pamphlets, artifacts, and oral histories on the history of California, Marin County, and Mill Valley.

*Writer Jack Kerouac and beat poet Gary Snyder shared a Mill Valley cabin in 1955-56 around 370 Montford Ave. in Homestead Valley. The cabin&#x27;s coincidental location in Marin County and its adjacent location to a meadow where horses grazed, combined with Snyder&#x27;s expertise in Asian languages and cultures, inspired Snyder name the cabin &quot;Marin-An&quot; (Japanese translation: &quot;Horse Grove Hermitage&quot;) It was during this stay in Mill Valley that Kerouac&#x27;s recent budding interest in Zen Buddhism was greatly expanded by Snyder&#x27;s expertise in the subject. Kerouac&#x27;s novel &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot; (1958) was consequently composed while living here and contains many semi-fictionalized accounts of his and Snyder&#x27;s lives while living at Marin-An.
*The fictional character Charley Furuseth, in Jack London&#x27;s 1904 novel &quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot; (1904), had a summer cottage here.
*American writer Cyra McFadden, while living in Mill Valley in the 1970s, wrote a column for the &quot;Pacific Sun&quot; newspaper entitled, &quot;The Serial&quot;, which satirized the trendy lifestyles of the affluent residents of Marin County. She later turned her column ideas into a novel, &quot;The Serial: A Year in the Life of Marin County&quot; (1977), which focused on the fictional exploits of a Mill Valley couple, Kate and Harvey Holroyd, who never quite fit into the Marin &quot;scene&quot;. The highly successful book was later adapted as a comedy film called &quot;Serial&quot; (1980), starring Tuesday Weld and Martin Mull.

===In music===
* The song &quot;Mill Valley&quot;, recorded in 1970 and released on the album &quot;Miss Abrams and the Strawberry Point 4th Grade Class&quot;, reached #90 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and #5 Easy Listening.

*The cover art for &quot;Sports&quot; (1983), the third album of Huey Lewis and the News, features a photo of the band at the 2 AM Club, a bar located in Mill Valley, where the band had performed during its early days.

<text>Muir Beach is a census designated place (CDP), unincorporated community, and beach on the Pacific Ocean. The community is located northwest of San Francisco in western Marin County, California, United States. Unlike many other entities in the area, it is not named directly in honor of conservationist John Muir; instead, it was named after Muir Woods National Monument to capitalize on the latter&#x27;s popularity. The population was 304 at the 2020 census. The community itself flanks the northwest side of the beach.

Located about from the entrance to Muir Woods, the beach is about long and wide, with coarse sand and several large boulders. Redwood Creek empties into the beach. There is a parking lot at the beach, which is accessible via a footbridge.

The subdivision of homes was formerly called Bello Beach, and the beach itself was formerly called Big Lagoon after a freshwater lagoon that was located where the parking lot is now. Damage from 20th century dairy farms interfered with the flow of the creek and the lagoon.

<text>Novato (Spanish for &quot;Novatus&quot;) is a city in Marin County, California, United States, situated in the North Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area. At the 2020 census, Novato had a population of 53,225.

==History==
What is now Novato was originally the site of several Coast Miwok villages: Chokecherry, near downtown Novato; Puyuku, near Ignacio; and Olómpali, at the present-day Olompali State Historic Park.

===Mexican era===

In 1839, the Mexican government granted the Rancho Novato to Fernando Feliz. The rancho was named after a local Miwok leader who had probably been given the name of Saint Novatus at his baptism. Subsequently, four additional land grants were made in the area: Rancho Corte Madera de Novato, to John Martin in 1839; Rancho San Jose, to Ignacio Pacheco in 1840; Rancho Olómpali, awarded in 1843 to Camilo Ynitia, son of a Coast Miwok chief; and Rancho Nicasio, by far the largest at , awarded to Pablo de la Guerra and John B.R. Cooper in 1844.

===Post-Conquest era===
Following the American Conquest of California and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Novato, along with the rest of California, became part of the United States on February 2, 1848. Early pioneers included Joseph Sweetser and Francis De Long who bought in the mid-1850s and planted orchards and vineyards.

The first post office at Novato opened in 1856; it closed in 1860, and a new post office opened in 1891.

The first school was built in 1859, at the corner of Grant Avenue and what is today Redwood Boulevard.

The original town was located around Novato Creek at what is now South Novato Boulevard. A railroad was built in 1879, connecting Novato to Sonoma County and San Rafael. The area around the train depot became known as &quot;New Town&quot;, and forms the edge of what today is Old Town Novato. The Novato Flatiron Building was built in 1908.

===Modern era===
The Great Depression of the 1930s had a marked effect on the area, as many farmers lost their land. After World War II, Novato grew quickly with the construction of tract homes and a freeway. As the area was unincorporated, much of the growth was unplanned and uncontrolled.

Novato was finally incorporated as a city in 1960. One of the most important events of the time (1960 to 1965) was &quot;Western Weekend&quot;. Beard-growing contests, sponsored by Bob&#x27;s Barber Shop, and many other odd activities helped to bring this community together.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, Novato has a total area of and is the largest city in area in Marin County. A total of is land and (1.85%) is water.

The southwestern part of Novato is significantly more mountainous, whereas eastern Novato is characterized by marshland and diked fields and pastures.

Major geographical features nearby include Mount Burdell and Mount Burdell Open Space Preserve to the north and Big Rock Ridge to the southwest. Stafford Lake to the west is a secondary water supply for Novato, with the Russian River in Sonoma County to the north supplying 80% of the city&#x27;s water.

Novato includes ten Marin County Open Space District preserves: Mount Burdell, Rush Creek, Little Mountain, Verissimo Hills, Indian Tree, Deer Island, Indian Valley, Ignacio Valley, Loma Verde, and Pacheco Valle. Although Novato is located on the water, access to the water is blocked by expansive farmland and wetlands.

Novato has a history of flooding due to its low-lying position, as well as the fact that much of the city used to be marshland. Due to the system of levees in Eastern Novato, flooding is quite common in that area, both from excessive rain and levee breaches.

The former Hamilton Air Force Base is also located in Novato, but was decommissioned in 1974 and designated a Historic District in 1998. After lying stagnant for many years, major renovations were pushed through by then-mayor Michael DiGiorgio. As of 2008 the base has largely been redeveloped into single-family homes.

=== Mining and quarrying ===
Novato&#x27;s history of mines and quarries goes back to 1863, when all of a sudden, multiple mining claims popped up in the area. At this time, most of the mines were either gold, silver, or copper mines. Initial results seemed promising, but eventually, prospects shifted elsewhere. Instead of mining for silver or gold, Novato&#x27;s quarries and mines turned to Mount Burdell. Mount Burdell ended up being the source of hundreds of thousands of hand-cut andesite paving blocks, that were used as ballast in ships and street construction as far away as in Europe. Many of San Francisco&#x27;s foundations and retaining walls from before the 1906 earthquake also came from Mount Burdell. Novato&#x27;s largest quarry, the Burdell quarry, produced upwards of 2000-4000 tons of stone daily. Even with such high production, the quarrying activity in Novato slowly waned until the last quarry, located on the west side of Mount Burdell, shut down in the 1990s.

<text>Point Reyes Station (formerly Marin and Olema Station) is a small unincorporated town in western Marin County, California, United States. Point Reyes Station is located south-southeast of Tomales, at an elevation of . Point Reyes Station is located along State Route 1 and is a gateway to the Point Reyes National Seashore, an extremely popular national preserve. The Point Reyes Station census-designated place (CDP) covers the unincorporated town and adjacent development to the north, with a total population of 895 as of the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Point Reyes Station is located at , just south and east of the southern end of Tomales Bay, and slightly east of the San Andreas Fault just before the fault submerges down the center of Tomales Bay. Via State Route 1, it is northwest of Stinson Beach and southeast of Tomales. San Francisco is to the southeast via Point Reyes–Petaluma Road, Nicasio Valley Road, and Lucas Valley Road.

Formerly an actual port and railway terminus, Point Reyes Station nominally borders Tomales Bay; the introduction of European cattle and planting of European grass seed on the natural hills caused destructive erosion, and a combination of small dirt dams, silting, and intentional landfill for farming raised the level of former salt marshes and has left Point Reyes Station approximately from the nearest tidal flats, and that after expenditure of millions of dollars and recent efforts for reclamation of the natural environment.

The CDP has a total area of , all land.

==History==
Once land of the Coast Miwok Indians, Point Reyes Station gets its name from the nearby Point Reyes Peninsula (a major peninsula sticking out into the Pacific Ocean) and its status as a terminus stop on the North Pacific Coast Railroad connecting Cazadero to the Sausalito ferry.

Point Reyes Station is very close to the San Andreas Fault, which was responsible for the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. At one time, the epicenter of the quake was thought to be near Olema. A walking tour of the fault can be taken from the Point Reyes National Seashore&#x27;s Visitor Center.

The place was called &quot;Olema Station&quot; when the railroad arrived in 1875. The Point Reyes post office opened in 1882. Its name changed thrice in 1891: first to Marin, then back to Point Reyes, and finally to the modern Point Reyes Station.

==History==
After the Mexican Revolution of 1821, the &quot;land grant&quot; system of parceling out land gave rise to what is now known as Marin County. Ross was originally part of an Mexican land grant to Juan B.R. Cooper in 1840 known as Ranch Punta de Quentin Canada de San Anselmo.

In 1857, James Ross (1812–1862) bought Rancho Punta de Quentin for $50,000. Ross, a Scot who had arrived in San Francisco from Australia in 1848 and made his fortune in the wholesale liquor business, set up a trading post called &quot;Ross Landing&quot;. He built his home on Redwood Drive and moved there with his wife and three children. When James Ross died in 1862, his wife, Annie Ross, was forced to sell a portion of her husband&#x27;s larger land holdings to pay each of their daughters $10,000. The remaining comprises the present-day Town of Ross.

<text>Santa Venetia is a census-designated place (CDP) in Marin County, California, United States. It is located north of downtown San Rafael, at an elevation of . The population was 4,289 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Santa Venetia is located in eastern Marin County at . It is bordered to the south and west by the city of San Rafael (the county seat) and to the east by San Pablo Bay, the northern part of the San Francisco Bay estuary. Gallinas Creek forms the northern edge of the community, and the eastern part of the CDP is occupied by China Camp State Park.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.79%, are water.

The main road of the community is North San Pedro Road, which passes by the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Marin County Civic Center. The road runs east through China Camp State Park, along the bay through Peacock Gap, and ends in San Rafael. Santa Venetia has an open space preserve for its marsh as it borders San Pablo Bay.

==History==
Santa Venetia is built on marshland that was filled in 1914. At that time, real estate developer Mabry McMahan envisioned a bayside luxury development modeled after Venice, Italy. Venice is known as &quot;Venezia&quot; in Italian; however, there is no actual Christian saint (&quot;Santa&quot;) named Venice or Venetia. The development was designed to be complete with canals and gondolas. The economic decline following the First World War put an end to the project.

It was only after the Second World War that significant development took place in Santa Venetia, with suburban developments such as Gallinas Village being built on the land originally filled in 1914.

Santa Venetia was home to the local YMCA until it was destroyed by a fire in 1986. Eventually the property was purchased by a developer who erected residential houses that were completed in 1987.

During the 1960s and 1970s the area was known affectionately to residents, especially teenagers, as &quot;Lower Scabo&quot; and &quot;Upper Scabo&quot;.

Today Santa Venetia is a quiet neighborhood with a rural feel. Residents treasure its proximity to China Camp State Park, and many homes along the canal have water access.
