<text>Homestead is a city within Miami-Dade County in the U.S. state of Florida, between Biscayne National Park to the east and Everglades National Park to the west. Homestead is primarily a Miami suburb and a major agricultural area. It is a principal city of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida, which was home to an estimated 6,012,331 people at the 2015 census. It is located approximately southwest of Miami, and northwest of Key Largo. The population was 80,737 as of the 2020 census.

The city of Homestead is located near the southern terminus of the Homestead Extension of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike where it ends at its junction with U.S. 1. Homestead is immediately north and east of Florida City, and these two cities comprise the greater Homestead–Florida City area. Some of the notable unincorporated communities in the area are Redland, Leisure City, Naranja, and Princeton.

==History==

In 1898, the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) planned an extension from Miami to Key West, proposing a station 30 miles south of Miami. Henry Flagler, founder of the FEC, agreed and suggested naming the station &quot;Ingraham&quot; after James E. Ingraham who was the vice president and land commissioner for the FEC at the time. Ingraham declined and suggested naming it &quot;Homestead&quot; instead, even though no one had homesteaded in the area at the time. At this time homesteading was ongoing north and northwest of the proposed station in the area that is now known as Redland.

Before the Homestead station was built a railway surveyor named John S. Fredricks laid out a town site around the planned station site on land owned by the FEC. At the time, it was common to plan towns around rail stations in undeveloped areas.

In July 1904, the Florida East Coast Railway opened the first station in what would later become Homestead. In October 1904, a settler and entrepreneur named William D. Horne arrived to homestead and was the first person to buy a lot at the new town site surrounding the railway. Shortly after his arrival, Mr. Horne constructed the first privately owned building in homestead &amp; used it as a store, rooming house &amp; post office. Today that building still stands as the historic Redland Hotel.

Homestead was incorporated in 1913 and is the second oldest city in Miami-Dade County next to the city of Miami. The name originates from when the Florida East Coast Railway extension to Key West was being built. The rail line was passing through an area opened up for homesteading, and as the construction camp at the end of the line did not have a particular name, construction materials and supplies for the workers were consigned to &quot;Homestead Country&quot;, shortened to &quot;Homestead&quot; by the engineers who mapped the area.

The 1926 hurricane and real estate downturn caused many small businesses and banks in Florida to fail. A lot of people left because their homes were destroyed or flooded, and most didn&#x27;t have insurance, facing hefty mortgage payments.

Homestead and neighboring South Miami-Dade County communities bore the brunt of Category 5 Hurricane Andrew on August 24, 1992.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of it is land and of it (0.63%) is water.

Homestead is a small-sized city. At its greatest north–south points – along SW 137th Avenue (Speedway Boulevard) – its city limits extend only  – from SW 288th Street (Biscayne Drive) at the north end to (theoretical) SW 352nd Street at the south end. At its greatest east–west points – along SW 328th Street (North Canal Drive / Lucy Street) – its city limits extend  – from (theoretical) SW 132nd Avenue at the east end to SW 192nd Avenue at the west end. U.S. 1 – known as Homestead Boulevard within the city limits – extends through a rather narrow northeast / southwest corridor of the city from SW 304th Street (Kings Highway) at the north end to SW 328th Street (Lucy Street) at the south end. It is at this point at the south end that Homestead and Florida City share a common border. (North of the north end at SW 304th Street is known as Unincorporated Miami-Dade County, but it is locally known as the community of Leisure City).

Major east–west streets within Homestead include SW 304th Street / NE &amp; NW 15th Street (Kings Highway), SW 312th Street / NE &amp; NW 8th Street (Campbell Drive), SW 320th Street (Mowry Drive), SW 328th Street / SE &amp; SW 8th Street (North Canal Drive / Lucy Street), and SW 344th Street / SE 24th Street (Palm Drive).

The original Homestead Air Force Base was once located several miles to the northeast of Homestead, but due to annexation of formerly unincorporated land immediately to the east and northeast of the original city limits during the late-1990s the city and the far southwestern perimeter of the (now) Homestead Air Reserve Base share a common border for a small portion along SW 137th Avenue (Speedway Boulevard).

A noteworthy tourist attraction within Leisure City is Coral Castle, built by a jilted lover, Edward Leedskalnin, over the course of 28 years from 1923 to 1951. The Fruit and Spice Park is also of interest.

Summers are hot and humid and high temperatures average between 90° and 92 °F (32° to 33 °C). Winters are warm and dry. The all-time record high temperature is , on July 10, 2023, and August 11, 2023. Lows in summer average between and , with low temperatures in all times of year averaging 5 degrees cooler than coastal Miami, mainly because of its inland and rural location. In winter, the area sees cold fronts bring cold weather for short periods from November to March. The lowest temperature ever recorded is 26 °F (–3 °C), on 13 December 1934, which was recorded at Homestead Air Force Base, some 10 miles east of the town. High temperatures in winter average between 68° and 80 °F (18° to 26 °C), and lows average between 57° and 64 °F (8° to 14 °C). Summer is the season when most of the rain occurs. Homestead has a wet season lasting from mid-May to early October. The dry season sees some rain, with most of it coming with the passing of cold fronts. Snow flurries were reported to have been observed in the air at Homestead Air Force Base, on January 20, 1977, and marked the farthest south that snow flurries have ever been reported in the lower 48 United States.

====Hurricanes====

In August 1992, the Category 5 hurricane Andrew devastated the town, as well as nearby Homestead Air Force Base. Hurricane Katrina caused flooding in Homestead in August 2005. The following October, Hurricane Wilma damaged light poles, grandstands, garages, and sections of catch fence at the Homestead–Miami Speedway, a motor racetrack built in the years following Hurricane Andrew. After Hurricane Wilma, a Homestead man was killed in a tractor accident while clearing debris.

When Hurricane Irma struck Florida in September 2017, parts of Homestead lost electric power. South Dade Center, a low-income housing project for farmworkers, was flooded with rainwater. Residents were without electricity and waste collection for about a week without relief.

The Trolley connects with Metrobus at the Busway and other Metrobus stops throughout the city.

Starting in 2014 the Homestead Trolley began seasonal service to Everglades National Park and Biscayne National Park. The free Homestead National Parks Trolley is offered by the City of Homestead in partnership with the National Park Service. Operating on weekends between January and April, the service is the only public transportation option available to these two parks.

The Homestead General Aviation Airport is located just northwest of the city&#x27;s central business district.

It is located in the upper Florida Keys on the islands of Elliott Key and other nearby keys, such as Totten Key. It was the only municipality in the Florida Keys not located in neighboring Monroe County. The population was 18 at the 2010 Census. Most residents of the city were National Park Service employees.

In the 2010 Primary Election, the Miami-Dade County Commission was empowered via a charter amendment to abolish Islandia. On December 6, 2011, Miami-Dade County Commissioners unanimously approved an ordinance to abolish the city, with final action to be taken after a public hearing. Following a public hearing, the ordinance abolishing Islandia received final approval on March 6, 2012, and took effect on March 16, 2012.

==History==

Islandia, particularly Elliott Key, was originally fished by the Native American Tequesta people. It subsequently became a haven for shipwreck survivors. By the mid-1800s, a group of Bahamians had made their way to the key, where they unsuccessfully tried farming on an island with a base of coral rock. By the early 1900s, Islandia had its own school district and more than 100 residents. However, the number of residents dwindled over time due to the lack of electricity, poor farming, and the relatively long distance from the mainland.

In 1950 the Dade County Planning Board announced a plan to build a highway connecting Key Biscayne with the Overseas Highway on Key Largo. The project envisioned a series of bridges connecting artificial islands, to be built on the Safety Valve, and existing small keys to Elliott Key and on to Key Largo. When the Dade County Planning Board was unable to secure a right of way for the highway across the southern end of Key Biscayne, it dropped the plan.

At the end of 1960, however, 13 of the island&#x27;s 18 registered voters approved the incorporation of a municipality, and the 33 northernmost islands of the Florida Keys became the city of Islandia. Developers and the residents revived the plan to build a causeway across the bay, and sought to fill Elliott Key with luxury hotels, golf courses, oceanfront homes, and a six-lane roadway running down the center of the key. A grassroots opposition of fishermen, gardeners, and elected state leaders opposed the plan, and sought to include the islands in the national park system. Islandia mayor Luther Brooks and his small city council fought back, and at one point obtained a large bulldozer and cleared a wide swath down the center of Elliott Key as the beginning of the proposed six-lane Elliott Key Boulevard.

Nevertheless, the purchase by the federal government of most of the land on Elliott Key ended those plans, and in 1968, Islandia was made a part of Biscayne National Monument (which later became Biscayne National Park). What remains today of the failed Elliott Key Boulevard is an wide nature trail covered by a tree canopy that is mockingly referred to as &quot;Spite Highway.&quot;

By 1990, exasperated by decades of the city not filing papers or following municipal procedures, the state of Florida ruled all of Islandia&#x27;s elections illegal on the grounds that only land owners, as opposed to all residents, had been permitted to vote, in violation of voting-rights laws. The state called for the dismantling of the municipality. In December 2011, the Miami-Dade County Commission finally agreed, and the area reverted to unincorporated status in March 2012 after the Commission gave final approval to the ordinance abolishing the City of Islandia.

The Kendale Lakes Country Club was bought by the Miccosukee tribe. It originally was an amenity offered to local homeowners. It is still surrounded by tree lined streets - a canopy of trees and lush green lawns. Coral rocks cover a moat which is located around its circumference, and it is dotted with lakes. At one time there was a small sandy beach and picnic area and pier which is now closed. There are remnants of the old pier.

<text>Kendall is an unincorporated area and census-designated place in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Miami metropolitan area. At the 2020 census, the area had a population of 80,241.

==History==
Much of what is now Kendall was purchased from the State of Florida in 1883 by the Florida Land and Mortgage Company. It was named for Henry John Broughton Kendall, a director of the company, who moved to the area in the 1900s to manage the company&#x27;s land. As the land was not open to homesteading, development was slow well into the 20th century. A post office opened in 1914, and the first school opened in 1929. After the end of the land boom in 1926, some residents left. Two Seminole camps were in the Kendall area, and Seminoles continued to live there into the 1940s.

Prior to the 1950s, the term &quot;Kendall&quot; was used to describe a region centered around U.S. Route 1, bounded by Snapper Creek to the north, the Everglades to the west, Old Cutler Road to the east, and the former community of Rockdale to the south. This area was largely uninhabited, generally consisting of pine rockland interspersed with fields and groves. As the region experienced rapid development in the 1950s, the moniker &quot;Kendall&quot; came to refer to the various communities built in the vicinity of present-day Pinecrest and the eastern half of the current Kendall CDP. When growth shifted west in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, the usage of the term steadily shifted west concurrently, and today it is most often applied to the area more formally known as West Kendall. Prior to incorporation in 1996, the Village of Pinecrest was still included in the official boundaries of Kendall CDP.
In August 1992, Kendall and the surrounding South Dade area were severely damaged by Hurricane Andrew. Many of the homes and businesses in the area were destroyed. In the subsequent years, the area was slowly rebuilt.

==Geography==

U.S. Route 1 forms the eastern boundary of Kendall; it leads northeast to Miami and southwest to Homestead. The Homestead Extension of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike forms the western boundary of Kendall, leading north to Doral and south to its southern terminus at Florida City. The Don Shula Expressway (Florida State Road 874) crosses Kendall from northeast to southwest.

<doc id="109444" wikidata="Q1650594" url="?curid=109444" title="Key Biscayne, Florida">
<text>Key Biscayne is an island village in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. The village is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. The population was 14,809 at the 2020 census, up from 12,344 in 2010.

==Geography==
Key Biscayne lies south of Miami Beach and east of Miami. The village is connected to Miami via the Rickenbacker Causeway, originally built in 1947. Because of its low elevation and direct exposure to the Atlantic Ocean, it is usually among the first Miami areas to be evacuated before an oncoming hurricane.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has an area of , of which is land and (27.0%) is water. The village is bordered on the north by Crandon Park, a Miami-Dade County park; on the south by Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park; on the east by the Atlantic Ocean; and on the west by Biscayne Bay.

==History==

===Rickenbacker Causeway===

While there had been earlier plans to develop a town on Key Biscayne, the opening of the Rickenbacker Causeway from Miami to Virginia Key and on to Key Biscayne in 1947 opened the island up to large-scale residential development. The northern two-thirds of the island had operated as the largest coconut plantation in the continental United States during the first half of the 20th century. 

In 1940, the Matheson family donated over of their land to Dade County for a public park, which became Crandon Park, in exchange for a commitment from the county that it would build a causeway to the island. The remaining Matheson property, stretching across the middle of the island, was sold to developers. Beginning in 1951, the Mackle Construction Company offered new homes on the island for $9,540, with $500 down. A U.S. Post Office branch opened in Key Biscayne, the Community Church started holding services in an old coconut-husking shed, and Key Biscayne Elementary School opened in 1952.

The island&#x27;s southern third, which included Cape Florida, was owned by James Deering, and, after his death, by his brother Charles, for 35 years. In 1948, José Manuel Áleman, a Cuban politician in exile, bought the Cape Florida property from the Deering estate. After Áleman died in 1951, his widow, Elena Santeiro Garcia, added to the property, purchasing an ocean-to-bay strip that had been part of the Matheson property. This strip included a canal William Matheson dug in the 1920s that extended from the bay across most of the island. The land north of the canal was developed as part of what is now the Village of Key Biscayne. In 1966, Garcia sold the Cape Florida property to the state of Florida, and the property became Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park, which opened January 1, 1967.

===Richard Nixon compound===

In 1969, U.S. President Richard Nixon purchased the first of his three waterfront homes, forming a compound known as the Florida White House, to be near his close friend and confidant Bebe Rebozo, owner of Key Biscayne Bank, and industrialist Robert Abplanalp, inventor of the modern spray can valve. Rebozo was indicted for laundering a $100,000 donation from Howard Hughes to Nixon&#x27;s election campaign. Presidents Kennedy and Nixon met for the first time after Nixon&#x27;s 1960 presidential campaign defeat in an oceanfront villa at the old Key Biscayne Hotel. 

Plans for the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate complex were discussed at Nixon&#x27;s Key Biscayne compound and, as the Watergate scandal unfolded, Nixon retreated into seclusion there with greater regularity. Between 1969 and 1973, he visited Key Biscayne over 50 times. The U.S. Department of Defense spent $400,000 constructing a helicopter landing pad in Biscayne Bay adjacent to his compound; when Nixon later sold the property, including the helicopter pad, there were public accusations that he had enriched himself at taxpayer expense.

===Incorporation===
The area was incorporated as a new municipality in 1991, making it the first new city in Miami-Dade County in over 50 years. Rafael Conte was elected the first mayor, along with the members of the founding village council: Clifford Brody, Mortimer Fried, Michael Hill, Bautista Tedin, Lucas Keller, Luis Lauredo, Joe Rasco, and Raymond Sullivan. The municipality&#x27;s first manager was C. Samuel Kissinger and the first clerk was Guido Inguanzo. The village&#x27;s incorporation, overseen by Alfred Brewer, provided local control over taxes and future development.

Key Biscayne is a small, intimate community. Most families that live there have known each other for generations. Children who grew up on the island are sometimes referred to as &quot;Key Rats&quot;.

===Hurricane Andrew===
In 1992, Hurricane Andrew flooded some homes and businesses on Key Biscayne, impacting insurance. The eye wall passed over uninhabited Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park, which received the brunt of the storm. The damage was a blessing for the park because it destroyed all the non-native vegetation the state had been trying to eradicate. Federal and state funding allowed the replanting with native vegetation, making the park a showplace natural area. The town is in Evacuation Zone A. 

In 2017, a study found that the town could be partly flooded at high tides by 2045 after sea-level rise. Property values fell. 

In November 2020, the town voted to approve a $100 million bond to protect itself.

The village has its own fire, police and public elementary and middle school. The millage tax rate remains one of the lowest of any municipality in Miami-Dade County. In 2004, the village completed the construction of a civic center, including fire, police and administration buildings and a recreation and community center with indoor multi-use courts, an outdoor swimming pool, and a musical theater program.

==Climate==
Key Biscayne has a tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot;). Key Biscayne experiences hot, humid summers and warm, dry winters. The island is in USDA plant zone 11a. Due to its island location, Key Biscayne is subject to cooler highs than Miami year-round. Hurricanes threaten the island occasionally, though landfalls are rare. Precipitation is lower than that of Miami, as the Atlantic Ocean inhibits summer thunderstorm convection.

==Hotels and condominiums controversy==
As noted above, the construction of several condominium complexes in Key Biscayne caused the population to soar. In 2007, voters approved an amendment to the village charter requiring that future land use changes be approved by voters. In 2008, the village council, saying that requiring community voting on zoning changes infringed on its responsibility, submitted another proposal to revise the charter. But on November 4, 2008, voters overwhelmingly rejected the council&#x27;s proposed change, defeating the amendment by a more than two-to-one margin.

==Other information==

<text>Miami Beach is a coastal resort city in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. The municipality is located on natural and human-made barrier islands between the Atlantic Ocean and Biscayne Bay, the latter of which separates the Beach from the mainland city of Miami. The neighborhood of South Beach, comprising the southernmost of Miami Beach, along with downtown Miami and the PortMiami, collectively form the commercial center of South Florida. Miami Beach&#x27;s population is 82,890 according to the 2020 census. It has been one of America&#x27;s preeminent beach resorts since the early 20th century.

In 1979, Miami Beach&#x27;s Art Deco Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Art Deco District is the largest collection of Art Deco architecture in the world and comprises hundreds of hotels, apartments and other structures erected between 1923 and 1943. Mediterranean, Streamline Moderne and Art Deco are all represented in the District.

The Historic District is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the East, Lenox Court on the West, 6th Street on the South and Dade Boulevard along the Collins Canal to the North. The movement to preserve the Art Deco District&#x27;s architectural heritage was led by former interior designer Barbara Baer Capitman, who now has a street in the District named in her honor.

== History ==



In 1870, father and son Henry and Charles Lum purchased land on Miami Beach for 75 cents an acre. The first structure to be built on this uninhabited oceanfront was the Biscayne House of Refuge, constructed in 1876 by the United States Life-Saving Service through an executive order issued by President Ulysses S. Grant, at approximately 72nd Street. Its purpose was to provide food, water, and a return to civilization for people who were shipwrecked. The structure, which had fallen into disuse by the time the Life-Saving Service became the U.S. Coast Guard in 1915, was destroyed in the 1926 Miami Hurricane and never rebuilt.

Miami Beach then initiated the planting of a coconut plantation along its shore in the 1880s, led by New Jersey entrepreneurs Ezra Osborn and Elnathan T. Field, but the venture failed. One of the investors in the project was agriculturist John S. Collins, who achieved success by buying out other partners and planting different crops, notably avocados, on the land that would later become Miami Beach. In fact, the pine trees on today&#x27;s Pinetree Drive served as an erosion buffer for Collins&#x27; plantations. Meanwhile, across Biscayne Bay, the City of Miami was established in 1896 with the arrival of the railroad and developed further as a port when the shipping channel of Government Cut was created in 1905, cutting off Fisher Island from the south end of the Miami Beach peninsula.

Collins&#x27; family members saw the potential in developing the beach as a resort. This effort got underway in the early years of the 20th century by the Collins/Pancoast family, the Lummus brothers, both bankers from Miami, and Indianapolis entrepreneur Carl G. Fisher. Until then, the beach here was only the destination for day-trips by ferry from Miami, across the bay. By 1912, Collins and Pancoast were working together to clear the land, plant crops, supervise the construction of canals to get their avocado crop to market and set up the Miami Beach Improvement Company. There were bathhouses and food stands, but no hotel until Brown&#x27;s Hotel was built in 1915 (still standing, at 112 Ocean Drive). Much of the interior landmass at that time was a tangled jungle of mangroves. Clearing it, deepening the channels and water bodies, and eliminating native growth almost everywhere in favor of landfill for development, was expensive. Once a 1600-acre, jungle-matted sand bar three miles out in the Atlantic, it grew to 2,800 acres when dredging and filling operations were completed.

With loans from the Lummus brothers, Collins had begun work on a 2½-mile-long wooden bridge, the world&#x27;s longest wooden bridge at the time, to connect the island to the mainland. When funds ran dry and construction work stalled, Indianapolis millionaire and recent Miami transplant Fisher intervened, providing the financing needed to complete the Collins Bridge the following year in return for a land swap deal. That transaction kicked off the island&#x27;s first real estate boom. The Collins Bridge cost over $150,000 and opened on June 12, 1913. Fisher helped by organizing an annual speed boat regatta, and by promoting Miami Beach as an Atlantic City-style playground and winter retreat for the wealthy. By 1915, Lummus, Collins, Pancoast, and Fisher were all living in mansions on the island, three hotels and two bathhouses had been erected, an aquarium built, and an 18-hole golf course landscaped.

The Town of Miami Beach was chartered on March 26, 1915; it grew to become a City in 1917. Even after the town was incorporated in 1915 under the name of Miami Beach, many visitors thought of the beach strip as Alton Beach, indicating just how well Fisher had advertised his interests there. The Lummus property was called Ocean Beach, with only the Collins interests previously referred to as Miami Beach. In 1925, the Collins Bridge was replaced by the Venetian Causeway, described as &quot;a series of drawbridges and renamed the Venetian Causeway&quot;.

Carl Fisher was the main promoter of Miami Beach&#x27;s development in the 1920s as the site for wealthy industrialists from the north and Midwest to and build their winter homes here. Many other Northerners were targeted to vacation on the island. To accommodate the wealthy tourists, several grand hotels were built, among them: The Flamingo Hotel, The Fleetwood Hotel, The Floridian, The Nautilus, and the Roney Plaza Hotel. In the 1920s, Fisher and others created much of Miami Beach as landfill by dredging Biscayne Bay; this human-made territory includes Star, Palm, and Hibiscus Islands, the Sunset Islands, much of Normandy Isle, and all of the Venetian Islands except Belle Isle. The Miami Beach peninsula became an island in April 1925 when Haulover Cut was opened, connecting the ocean to the bay, north of present-day Bal Harbour. The great 1926 Miami hurricane put an end to this prosperous era of the Florida Boom, but in the 1930s Miami Beach still attracted tourists, and investors constructed the mostly small-scale, stucco hotels and rooming houses, for seasonal rental, that comprise much of the present &quot;Art Deco&quot; historic district.

Carl Fisher brought Steve Hannagan to Miami Beach in 1925 as his chief publicist. Hannagan set-up the Miami Beach News Bureau and notified news editors that they could &quot;Print anything you want about Miami Beach; just make sure you get our name right.&quot; The News Bureau sent thousands of pictures of bathing beauties and press releases to columnists like Walter Winchell and Ed Sullivan. One of Hannagan&#x27;s favorite venues was a billboard in Times Square, New York City, where he ran two taglines: &quot;&#x27;It&#x27;s always June in Miami Beach&#x27; and &#x27;Miami Beach, Where Summer Spends the Winter.&#x27;&quot;

Anti-semitism was rampant in the 1920s and into the 30s. Developer Carl Fisher would sell property only to gentiles so Jews were required to live south of Fifth Street. As recently as the 1930s, hotels refused to accept Jews. As the 1930s developed, the &quot;dismantling on Miami Beach of restrictive barriers to Jewish ownership of real estate&quot; was underway; many Jews bought properties from others. 

By the 1940s and 50s, an increasing number of Jewish families built hotels. The first &quot;skyscraper&quot; was the 18-story Lord Tarleton Hotel built in 1940 by Samuel Jacobs. The Jewish mobster Meyer Lansky, who ran some &quot;carpet joints&quot; (gambling operations) in Florida by 1936, and eventually controlled casinos in Cuba and Las Vegas, retired in Miami and died in Miami Beach. 

During World War II, Jewish doctors were not granted staff privileges at any area hospitals so the community built Mount Sinai Medical Center on Miami Beach. The North Shore Jewish Center was built in 1951 and became Temple Menorah after an expansion in 1963.

Post–World War II economic expansion brought a wave of immigrants to South Florida from the Northern United States, which significantly increased the population in Miami Beach within a few decades. After Fidel Castro&#x27;s rise to power in 1959, a wave of Cuban refugees entered South Florida and dramatically changed the demographic make-up of the area. In 2017, one study named zip code 33109 (Fisher Island, a 216-acre island located just south of Miami Beach), as having the 4th most expensive home sales and the highest average annual income ($2.5 million) in 2015.

The sun and warm climate attracted many Jewish families and retirees. One estimate states that &quot;20,000 elderly Jews&quot; were part of the population of the beach in the late 1970s&quot;. In a 2017 interview, a demographer from the University of Miami estimated that there &quot;might have been as many as 70,000 Jews in Miami Beach at one point&quot; declining to &quot;around 19,000 in 2014&quot;. The decline was motivated partly by &quot;increasing prices during the art deco movement and an 
increase in crime and changing cultural demographics&quot;.

In 1980 however, 62 percent of the population of Miami Beach was still Jewish. During the 1980s many of the Jewish citizens left and moved to &quot;Delray Beach, Lake Worth and Boca Raton&quot;. During the 1990s, South Beach transformed into a home of the fashion industry and celebrities. In 1999, there were only 10,000 Jewish people living in Miami Beach.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (62.37%) is water.

===Elevation and tidal flooding===
Miami Beach encounters tidal flooding of certain roads during the annual king tides, though some tidal flooding has been the case for decades, as the parts of the western side of South Beach are at virtually above normal high tide, with the entire city averaging only above mean sea level (AMSL). However, a recent study by the University of Miami showed that tidal flooding became much more common from the mid-2000s. The fall 2015 king tides exceeded expectations in longevity and height. Traditional sea level rise and storm mitigation measures including sea walls and dykes, such as those in the Netherlands and New Orleans, may not work in South Florida due to the porous nature of the ground and limestone beneath the surface.

In addition to present difficulty with below-grade development, some areas of southern Florida, especially Miami Beach, are beginning to engineer specifically for sea level rise and other potential effects of climate change. This includes a five-year, US$500 million project for the installation of 60 to 80 pumps, building of taller sea walls, planting of red mangrove trees along the sea walls, and the physical raising of road tarmac levels, as well as possible zoning and building code changes, which could eventually lead to retrofitting of existing and historic properties. Some streets and sidewalks were raised about over previous levels; the four initial pumps installed in 2014 are capable of pumping 4,000 US gallons per minute. However, this plan is not without criticism. Some residents worry that the efforts will not be sufficient to successfully adapt to rising sea levels and wish the city had pursued a more aggressive plan. 

On the other hand, some worry that the city is moving too quickly with untested solutions. Others yet have voiced concerns that the plan protects big-money interests in Miami Beach. Pump failures such as during construction or power outages, including a Tropical Storm Emily-related rain flood on August 1, 2017, can cause great unexpected flooding. Combined with the higher roads and sidewalks, this leaves unchanged properties relatively lower and prone to inundation.

===Climate===

According to the Köppen climate classification, Miami Beach has a tropical monsoon climate (Am). Like much of Florida, there is a marked wet and dry season in Miami Beach. Rainfall amounts to about per year. The tropical rainy season runs from May through October, when showers and late day thunderstorms are common. The dry season is from November through April, when few showers, sunshine, and low humidity prevail. The island location of Miami Beach, however, creates fewer convective thunderstorms, so Miami Beach receives less rainfall in a given year than neighboring areas such as Miami and Fort Lauderdale. Proximity to the moderating influence of the Atlantic gives Miami Beach lower high temperatures and higher lows than inland areas of Florida. Miami Beach is in hardiness zone 11a, with an annual mean minimum temperature of . Miami Beach has never reported temperatures below .

Miami Beach&#x27;s location on the Atlantic Ocean, near its confluence with the Gulf of Mexico, make it extraordinarily vulnerable to hurricanes and tropical storms. Miami has experienced several direct hits from major hurricanes in recorded weather history – the 1906 Florida Keys hurricane, 1926 Miami hurricane, 1935 Yankee hurricane, 1941 Florida hurricane, 1948 Miami Hurricane, 1950 Hurricane King and 1964 Hurricane Cleo, the area has seen indirect contact from hurricanes: 1945 Homestead Hurricane, Betsy (1965), Inez (1966), Andrew (1992), Irene (1999), Michelle (2001), Katrina (2005), Wilma (2005), and Irma (2017).

==Economy==
===Tourism===
The City of Miami Beach accounts for more than half of tourism to Miami Dade County. Of the 15.86 million people staying in the county in 2017, 58.5% lodged in Miami Beach. Resort taxes account for over 10% of the city&#x27;s operating budget, providing $83 million in the fiscal year 2016–2017. On average, the city&#x27;s resort tax revenue grows by three to five percent annually. Miami Beach hosts 13.3 million visitors each year. In fiscal year 2016/2017, Miami Beach had over 26,600 hotel rooms. Average occupancy in fiscal year 2015/2016 was 76.4% and 78.5% in fiscal year 2016/2017. Mayor Harold Rosen is credited with beginning the revitalization of Miami Beach when he notably abolished rent control in 1976, a move that was highly controversial at the time.

=== The Miami Beach Visitor and Convention Authority ===
The Miami Beach Visitor and Convention Authority is a seven-member board, appointed by the City of Miami Beach Commission. The authority, established in 1967 by the State of Florida legislature, is the official marketing and public relations organization for the city, to support its tourism industry.

==Arts and culture ==
 
South Beach (also known as SoBe, or simply the Beach), the area from Biscayne Street (also known as South Pointe Drive) one block south of 1st Street to about 23rd Street, is one of the more popular areas of Miami Beach. Although topless sunbathing by women has not been officially legalized, female toplessness is tolerated on South Beach and in a few hotel pools on Miami Beach. Before the TV show &quot;Miami Vice&quot; helped make the area popular, SoBe was under urban blight, with vacant buildings and a high crime rate. Today, it is considered one of the richest commercial areas on the beach, yet poverty and crime still remain in some places near the area.

Miami Beach, particularly Ocean Drive of what is now the Art Deco District, was also featured prominently in the 1983 feature film &quot;Scarface&quot; and the 1996 comedy &quot;The Birdcage&quot;.

Lincoln Road, running east–west parallel between 16th and 17th Streets, is a nationally known spot for outdoor dining and shopping and features galleries of well known designers, artists and photographers such as Romero Britto, Peter Lik, and Jonathan Adler. In 2015, the Miami Beach residents passed a law forbidding bicycling, rollerblading, skateboarding and other motorized vehicles on Lincoln Road during busy pedestrian hours between 9:00 am and 2:00 am.

=== Historic preservation ===

By the 1970s, jet travel had enabled vacationers from the northern parts of the US to travel to the Caribbean and other warm-weather climates in the winter. Miami Beach&#x27;s economy suffered. Elderly retirees, many with little money, dominated the population of South Beach.

To help revive the area, city planners and developers sought to bulldoze many of the aging art deco buildings that were built in the 1930s. By one count, the city had over 800 art deco buildings within its borders.

In 1976, Barbara Baer Capitman and a group of fellow activists formed the Miami Design Preservation League (MDPL) to try to halt the destruction of the historic buildings in South Beach. After battling local developers and Washington DC bureaucrats, MDPL prevailed in its quest to have the Miami Beach Art Deco District named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. While the recognition did not offer protection for the buildings from demolition, it succeeded in drawing attention to the plight of the buildings.

Due in part to the newfound awareness of the art deco buildings, vacationers, tourists and TV, and movie crews were drawn to South Beach. Investors began to rehabilitate hotels, restaurants and apartment buildings in the area.

Despite the enthusiasm for the historic buildings by many, there were no real protections for historic buildings. As wrecking crews threatened buildings, MDPL members protested by holding marches and candlelight vigils. In one case, protestors stood in front of a hotel blocking bulldozers as they approached a hotel.
After many years of effort, the Miami Beach city commission created the first two historic preservation districts in 1986. The districts covered Espanola Way and most of Ocean Drive and Collins Avenue in South Beach. The designation of the districts helped protect buildings from demolition and created standards for renovation.

While some developers continued to focus on demolition, several investors like Tony Goldman and Ian Schrager bought art deco hotels and transformed them into world famous hot spots in the ‘80s and ‘90s. Among the celebrities that frequented Miami Beach were Madonna, Sylvester Stallone, Cher, Oprah Winfrey and Gianni Versace.

Additional historic districts were created in 1992. The new districts covered Lincoln Road, Collins Avenue between 16th and 22nd Streets and the area around the Bass Museum. In 2005, the city began the process of protecting the mid-century buildings on Collins Avenue between 43rd to 53rd Streets including the Fontainebleau and Eden Roc Hotels. Several North Beach neighborhoods were designated as historic in 2018. A large collection of MiMo (Miami Modern) buildings can be found in the area.

===The arts===

Jackie Gleason hosted his &quot;Jackie Gleason and His American Scene Magazine&quot; (September 29, 1962 – June 4, 1966) television show, after moving it from New York to Miami Beach in 1964, reportedly because he liked year-round access to the golf course at the nearby Inverrary Country Club in Lauderhill (where he built his final home). His closing line became, almost invariably, &quot;As always, the Miami Beach audience is the greatest audience in the world!&quot; In the Fall 1966 television season, he abandoned the American Scene Magazine format and converted the show into a standard variety hour with guest performers. The show was renamed &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;, lasting from September 17, 1966 – September 12, 1970. He started the 1966–1967 season with new, color episodes of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, with Sheila MacRae and Jane Kean as Alice Kramden and Trixie Norton, respectively. The regular cast included Art Carney as Ed Norton; Milton Berle was a frequent guest star. The show was shot in color on videotape at the Miami Beach Auditorium (later renamed the Jackie Gleason Theatre of the Performing Arts), now known as Fillmore Miami Beach, and Gleason never tired of promoting the &quot;sun and fun capital of the world&quot; on camera. CBS canceled the series in 1970.

Each December, the City of Miami Beach hosts Art Basel Miami Beach, one of the largest art shows in the United States. Art Basel Miami Beach, the sister event to the Art Basel event held each June in Basel, Switzerland, combines an international selection of top galleries with a program of special exhibitions, parties and crossover events featuring music, film, architecture, and design. Exhibition sites are located in the city&#x27;s Art Deco District, and ancillary events are scattered throughout the greater Miami metropolitan area.

The first Art Basel Miami Beach was held in 2002. In 2016, about 77,000 people attended the fair. The 2017 show featured about 250 galleries at the Miami Beach Convention Center.

Miami Beach is home to the New World Symphony, established in 1987 under the artistic direction of Michael Tilson Thomas. In January 2011, the New World Symphony made a highly publicized move into the New World Center building designed by Canadian American Pritzker Prize-winning architect Frank Gehry. Gehry is famous for his design of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, California. The new Gehry building offers Live Wallcasts™, which allow visitors to experience select events throughout the season at the half-acre, outdoor Miami Beach SoundScape through the use of visual and audio technology on a projection wall.

Miami beach is also home to Miami New Drama, the resident theater company at the historic Colony Theatre on Lincoln Road. The regional theater company was founded in 2016 by Venezuelan playwright and director, Michel Hausmann, and playwright, director, and Medal of the Arts winner, Moises Kaufman. In October 2016, Miami New Drama took over operations of the Colony Theatre, and since then, the 417-seat Art Deco venue hosts Miami New Drama&#x27;s theatrical season as well as other live events.

The Miami City Ballet, a ballet company founded in 1985, is housed in a building near Miami Beach&#x27;s Bass Museum of Art.

The Miami Beach Festival of the Arts is an annual outdoor art festival that was begun in 1974.

===Jewish community===

Miami Beach is home to several Orthodox Jewish communities with a network of well-established synagogues and yeshivas, the first of which being the Landow Yeshiva, a Chabad institution in operation for over 30 years. There is also a liberal Jewish community containing such famous synagogues as Temple Emanu-El, Temple Beth Shalom and Cuban Hebrew Congregation. Miami Beach is also a magnet for Jewish families, retirees, and particularly snowbirds when the cold winter sets into the north. These visitors range from the Modern Orthodox to the Haredi and Hasidic – including many rebbes who vacation there during the North American winter. Till his death in 1991, the Nobel laureate writer Isaac Bashevis Singer lived in the northern end of Miami Beach and breakfasted often at Sheldon&#x27;s drugstore on Harding Avenue.

There are many kosher restaurants and even kollels for post-graduate Talmudic scholars, such as the Miami Beach Community Kollel. Miami Beach had roughly 60,000 people in Jewish households (62 percent of the total population) in 1982, but only 16,500 (19 percent of the population) in 2004, according to Ira Sheskin, a demographer at the University of Miami who conducts surveys once a decade. The Miami Beach Jewish community had decreased in size by 1994 due to migration to wealthier areas and aging of the population.

Miami Beach is home to the Holocaust Memorial of the Greater Miami Jewish Federation.

=== LGBT community ===

Miami Beach has been regarded as a gay mecca for decades as well as being one of the most LGBT friendly cities in the United States. Miami Beach is home to numerous gay bars and gay-specific events, and five service and resource organizations. After decades of economic and social decline, an influx of gays and lesbians moving to South Beach in the late-1980s to mid-1990s contributed to Miami Beach&#x27;s revitalization. The newcomers purchased and restored dilapidated Art Deco hotels and clubs, started numerous businesses and built political power in city and county government.

The passage of progressive civil rights laws, election of outspokenly pro-gay Miami Beach Mayor Matti Bower, and the introduction of Miami Beach&#x27;s Gay Pride Celebration, have reinvigorated the local LGBT community in recent years, which some argued had experienced a decline in the late 2000s. In January 2010, Miami Beach passed a revised Human Rights Ordinance that strengthens enforcement of already existing human rights laws and adds protections for transgender people, making Miami Beach&#x27;s human rights laws some of the most progressive in the state.

Miami Beach Pride has gained prominence since it first started in 2009, there has been an increase in attendance every year. In 2013 there were more than 80,000 people who participated to now more than 130,000 people that participate in the festivities every year. It has also attracted many celebrities such as Chaz Bono, Adam Lambert, Gloria Estefan, Mario Lopez, and Elvis Duran who were Grand Marshals for Pride Weekend from 2012 through 2016 respectively. There are over 125 businesses who are LGBT supportive that sponsor Miami Beach Pride.

==Government==
Miami Beach is governed by a ceremonial mayor and six commissioners. Although the mayor runs commission meetings, the mayor and all commissioners have equal voting power and are elected by popular election. The mayor serves for terms of two years with a term limit of three terms and commissioners serve for terms of four years and are limited to two terms. Commissioners are voted for citywide and every two years three commission seats are voted upon.

A city manager is responsible for administering governmental operations. An appointed city manager is responsible for administration of the city. The City Clerk and the City Attorney are also appointed officials.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

Public Transportation in Miami Beach is operated by Miami-Dade Transit (MDT). Along with neighborhoods such as Downtown and Brickell, public transit is heavily used in Miami Beach and is a vital part of city life. Although Miami Beach has no direct Metrorail stations, numerous Metrobus lines connect to Downtown Miami and Metrorail (i.e., the &#x27;S&#x27; bus line). The South Beach Local (SBL) is one of the most heavily used lines in Miami and connects all major points of South Beach to other major bus lines in the city. Metrobus ridership in Miami Beach is high, with some of the routes such as the L and S being the busiest Metrobus routes.

====Bicycling====
Since the late 20th century, cycling has grown in popularity in Miami Beach. Due to its dense, urban nature, and pedestrian-friendly streets, many Miami Beach residents get around by bicycle.

In March 2011 a public bicycle sharing system named Decobike was launched, one of only a handful of such programs in the United States. The program is operated by a private corporation, Decobike, LLC, but is partnered with the City of Miami Beach in a revenue-sharing model. Once fully implemented, the program hopes to have around 1000 bikes accessible from 100 stations throughout Miami Beach, from around 85th Street on the north side of Miami Beach all the way south to South Pointe Park.

<text>Miami Lakes, officially the Town of Miami Lakes, is an incorporated town in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. The town is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population was 30,467.

==History==
The development was constructed by Sengra (now the Graham Companies) beginning in 1962 on land formerly owned by Florida state senator Ernest &quot;Cap&quot; Graham. The Grahams stated for many years that it would be a 30-year development, but they are still developing to this day.

The original Miami Lakes development, east of the Palmetto Expressway, was master-planned by Lester Collins with curving tree-shaded roadways and numerous curving lakes, which are unusual compared to most surrounding areas with their treeless streets on a square grid and rectangular lakes. This original development, which is on the east side of the more recently designated Town of Miami Lakes, has neighborhood shopping centers, tot-lot parks, and a town center named Main Street. A significant portion of Miami Lakes is still owned by the Grahams, mostly apartment buildings, shopping centers, office buildings, and undeveloped land. The town is an early model of the New Urbanism movement, with shopping and services located within walking distance of residences as well as narrow, walkable streets and plenty of neighborhood parks.

When it was incorporated in December 2000, the Town of Miami Lakes became the 31st municipality in Miami-Dade County. Miami Lakes is home to more than 1,100 businesses.

The Master Plan began over 50 years ago when the Graham family began the development of what was their dairy farm. Unlike many cities and towns created during the early 1960s, the Grahams decided to create a master plan for the city that would allow decades of growth, construction, and changing market conditions. Lester Collins, former dean of the Harvard School of Design, was enlisted to create a master plan for the area that would become the center of Miami Lakes. Collins laid the foundation for an integrated community, including residential, commercial, industrial, and mixed uses.

Former U.S. Senator Bob Graham, the younger half-brother of family patriarch William &quot;Bill&quot; Graham, is one of the owners, and Katharine Graham, the late publisher of the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, had a share by marriage.

<text>Miami Shores or Miami Shores Village is a village in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The village is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population was 11,567, up from 10,493 in 2010.

==History==
By the early 1900s, the area encompassing today&#x27;s Miami Shores was occupied by a starch (coontie) mill, a tomato packing plant, a saw mill, a pineapple plantation and a grapefruit grove. These were the various enterprises in which the early pioneers were engaged, and with the coming of the railroad and its stop at the Biscayne station, they were able to live off the land. Two of the most successful growers were Major Hugh Gordon and T.V. Moore. T.V. Moore owned the land in what is today&#x27;s commercial district, while the Gordon Tract bordered the bay. By 1922, Lee T. Cooper, who had amassed his wealth from a patent medicine by the name of Tanlac, purchased T.V. Moore&#x27;s land holdings. Cooper planned to develop the area and named it &quot;Bay View Estates&quot;. In 1924, the Shoreland Company purchased the Gordon Tract, Bay View Estates and other scattered acreage in order to create Miami Shores, &quot;America&#x27;s Mediterranean&quot;.

Hugh M. Anderson, president of the Shoreland Company, and its board of directors were experienced real estate developers. They had previously completed the successful development of the Venetian Islands in Miami Beach, and they decided that their new project would be similar – residences of Italian-inspired architecture within a landscape associated with water. The master development plan for Greater Miami Shores included 9,000 building sites, 5 miles of bay frontage, four miles of inland waterways and ten miles of main roadways. The plans also called for the construction of a causeway to Miami Beach, a golf course, a country club, a yacht club, a business district, apartment buildings, hotels, a school and churches, a railroad station and beautifying features such as parks, plazas and entryways.

A total of 118 upscale Mediterranean homes were built by the Shoreland Company. These homes have great historic value, and 25 have been designated on the National Register of Historic Places so far. The commercial building program was in progress, sidewalks and roadways were being laid out, and lighting and landscape work was well underway. Record-setting sales and resales of property were being recorded. Unfortunately, on September 18, 1926, all plans for the community came to a halt with the arrival of a devastating hurricane. This and other factors contributed to the Shoreland Company&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1927.

In 1928, the New Miami Shores Corporation purchased the Shoreland Company&#x27;s holdings. This corporation was controlled by Bessemer Properties, part of the interests of the Wolstenholme family of New York. Roy H. Hawkins, the general manager of Bessemer Properties, proceeded with the plans for the community. He is credited as being the &quot;principal founder&quot; of Miami Shores. In 1931, under his leadership, a request to grant a charter creating the Miami Shores Village was presented in the state legislature.

The present Miami Shores roughly corresponds with the original &quot;Biscayne&quot; neighborhood of the city of Miami. With the arrival of the Great Depression, Miami gave up its jurisdiction and the area incorporated under the name &quot;Miami Shores Village&quot; in 1932. Previously, part of the area that now comprises the city of North Miami had been known as Miami Shores. Under the leadership of Roy H. Hawkins, a request to grant a charter creating Miami Shores Village was presented in the state legislature. On January 2, 1932, the village became official at a council meeting. The charter named the following five members to the first council: Hugh H. Gordon, a banker whose father had owned the Gordon Tract; Frank O. Pruitt, who was in the insurance business; John M. Carlisle, president of the Eli Witt Cigar Company; W.F. Andes, a prominent dentist; and M.R. Harrison, a general contractor, who constructed much of Biscayne Boulevard. At this first meeting, Pruitt was elected mayor, and other appointments were made including Village Manager Miller Williams, Village Attorney George E. Holt, and a single policeman, Ed Badger.

In the decades that followed its incorporation, growth was steady. A variety of architectural styles were introduced, yet the community emerged as the type of development the Shoreland Company had envisioned. The community retains many of its original characteristics – well situated and served by major highways, having tree-lined streets and wide roads, a downtown area, well-maintained homes provided with efficient services. and a variety of community activities.

Miami Shores is primarily a bedroom community for those working in the Miami metropolitan area, and it also has a sizable retired population. The village is mostly single family residential homes, with very few multi-family units and only two small commercial areas along Northeast 2nd Avenue and Biscayne Boulevard.

While it is frequently referred to as Miami Shores or the Village of Miami Shores, the municipality&#x27;s official name under its charter is Miami Shores Village.

==Geography==
Miami Shores is located in northeastern Miami-Dade County at . It is bordered to the north by Biscayne Park, to the west by unincorporated Pinewood, to the southwest by El Portal, to the south by the city of Miami, to the east by Biscayne Bay and, across the bay, by the city of Miami Beach.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of . of it are land, and of it (34.19%) are water.

About 6.9% of families and 8.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 11.2% of those under age 18 and 7.6% of those age 65 or over.

==Government==

===Form of government===
The village operates under a council-manager system. It has a city council of five members, who are elected at-large. The Village Charter provides that the two individuals receiving the highest number of votes are elected to four-year terms. The individual(s) receiving the next highest number of votes is elected to a two-year term. The position of mayor is selected by the council at its inaugural meeting. Historically, the individual receiving the highest number of votes is selected to serve as the mayor and holds this position for two years of the four-year term. At the conclusion of his or her term as mayor, the individual retains a seat on the council as a &quot;regular&quot; council member for the next two years. Elections are held every two years, with either two or three seats being open at each election in the ordinary course of events.

Each council member is a voting member of the council, with the mayor serving as the chair. The council is responsible for enacting most village laws, approving capital expenditures, and hiring the village manager. There are also a number of administrative boards, such as planning &amp; zoning, code enforcement, and personnel appeals, that manage various aspects of the village government.

The village manager is the chief executive officer in charge of managing the day-to-day functions of the village. The village maintains its own police department, but fire services are supplied by the county, with Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Department Station No. 38 located in the village.

===Regulation of vegetable gardens===
In 2013, two residents, a married couple named Hermine Ricketts and Tom Carroll, were cited by the village under a code provision that prohibited vegetable gardens in front yards. The majority of the couple&#x27;s front yard was planted with various vegetables, and had been in place for 17 years. The garden, which regularly received compliments from neighbors, supplied about 80% of the couple&#x27;s meals. And although the garden had existed for 17 years, the city could produce no record of a single complaint. Nonetheless, just weeks after amending its ordinances &quot;for clarity,&quot; the Miami Shores Code Enforcement Board ordered the couple to destroy the garden or face recurring fines of $50 per day.

The Institute for Justice filed a suit on their behalf, claiming that the &quot;backyard only&quot; rule was arbitrary and violated the couple&#x27;s property rights under the Florida Constitution. The story garnered national attention. On August 25, 2016, Judge Monica Gordo granted the village&#x27;s summary judgment motion, finding that, &quot;the prohibition of vegetable gardens except in backyards is rationally related to Miami Shores&#x27; legitimate interest in promoting and maintaining aesthetics,&quot; and that the rule therefore &quot;passes constitutional scrutiny.&quot;

The ruling subsequently was upheld by the Florida Third District Court of Appeal, which stated, &quot;Following the ineluctable conclusion that the Village ordinance does not restrict a fundamental right or suspect class, [two cases previously discussed] control the analysis in this case. The ordinance is constitutional. We agree with the trial court&#x27;s parting observation that the appellants &#x27;still have a remedy. They can petition the Village Council to change the ordinance. They can also support candidates for Council who agree with their view that the ordinance should be repealed.&#x27;&quot; The city defended the ruling, saying that &quot;without any arbiter of taste, residents could get stuck living next to a polka-dot house with pigs taking mud baths by the garage and an Oscar Mayer Wienermobile on the swale.&quot;

Although the case gathered local and national news attention, the Supreme Court of Florida declined to hear the case.

In the spring of 2019 representatives from the Florida Senate and House of Representatives passed legislation to protect private property rights and override local ordinances and allow vegetable gardens to be grown and cared for by property owners within any location on their property. The current Florida governor signed the legislature on June 24, 2019, creating Florida Statute 604.71. The new ordinance became effective July 1, 2019.

The preamble to Florida Statute 604.71 reads:

&quot;An Act Relating to Vegetable Gardens: Providing legislative intent: Prohibiting local governments from regulating vegetable gardens on residential properties except as otherwise provided by law; specifying that such regulations are void and unenforceable; specifying exceptions; providing applicability; defining the term &#x27;vegetable garden&#x27;; providing and effective date&quot;.
=== Alleged racial discrimination in seatbelt ticketing ===
Following the January 2016 report &quot;Racial Disparities in Florida Safety Belt Law Enforcement&quot;, published by the ACLU (which did not mention Miami Shores), local CBS-affiliate station WFOR-TV gathered additional statistics from the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. One sentence in the report noted that &quot;in Miami Shores, there were 261 seat belt citations issued with 186 [(71%)] going to blacks.&quot; The report did not discuss whether any of the drivers were initially stopped for other violations. It also failed to note the area&#x27;s large African American population. Miami Shores itself is 23.8% African American, as compared to 18.9% for Miami-Dade County and 16.31% for Florida as a whole. More significantly, neighboring areas have large African American majorities. For example, North Miami&#x27;s population is roughly six times that of Miami Shores, 58.9% being African American (i.e., the African American population of North Miami is more than three times the total population of Miami Shores). Other nearby neighborhoods include Little Haiti (64.9% African American), West Little River (57.2% African American), Gladeview (76.98% African American), and Westview (75.6% African American).

==Public library==

Brockway Memorial Library was founded in 1949. While over the years the countywide Miami-Dade Public Library System has taken over the libraries of most of the cities in the county, the Miami Shores public library has remained independent.

This independent public library first opened in February 1949 due to the generosity of George A. Brockway, an industrialist and part-time South Florida resident, who donated the funds to build the library.

<text>Miami Springs is a city in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. The city is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. As of 2020, the population recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau was 13,859.

==History==
The city was founded by Glenn Hammond Curtiss, &quot;The Father of Naval Aviation&quot;, and James Bright, during the famous &quot;land boom&quot; of the 1920s and was originally named &quot;Country Club Estates&quot;. It, along with other cities in Miami-Dade County such as Coral Gables and Opa-locka, formed some of the first planned communities in the state. Like its counterparts, the city had an intended theme which in its case, was to reflect a particular architecture and ambiance.

In this case it was a regional style of architecture called Pueblo Revival developed in the American Southwest, primarily New Mexico, and incorporating design elements of pueblo architecture. Other buildings incorporated Mission-style design. In fact, the original Hotel Country Club was designed to resemble a pueblo village.

Shortly prior to incorporation in 1926, the city was renamed after a spring located in the area which provided parts of Miami with fresh water until the mid-1990s.

==Geography==
Miami Springs is located northwest of downtown Miami at . It is bordered to the northeast by the city of Hialeah and to the southwest by the village of Virginia Gardens.

==History==

Miami Springs was founded by Glenn Curtiss, an aviation pioneer, and thus, the fate of the city has always been intertwined with the aviation industry, particularly since Miami International Airport (MIA) is located just south of the city on the southern border of NW 36th Street. The airline industry brought many residents from airline crew bases, as well as employment opportunities at the airport, which brought much prosperity to the city. This dependence, however, left the city vulnerable. The sudden 1991 collapses of both Eastern Airlines and Pan American World Airways left many Miami Springs residents unemployed and unable to afford living in the neighborhood. Given that the businesses in Miami Springs had always relied upon the large disposable incomes of the employees of the large airline carriers, the bankruptcy of both corporations in the same year created a chain reaction, eventually causing many small businesses to close their doors. Despite the closure of the airlines, from a residential standpoint, Miami Springs remained strong. The city is often seen as blessedly isolated from the perceived turbulence of the rest of Miami-Dade County. This has continued to provide ample replacements for the older residents who are lost over time. Nonetheless, the legacy of the airline closures remains. Residential millage taxation rates hover near the state mandated maximum.

==Economy==
The Consulate-General of Bolivia in Miami is located in Suite 505 at 700 South Royal Poinciana Boulevard in Miami Springs.

==Significant historical landmarks==

Curtiss Mansion is a Pueblo style home that belonged to city founder Glenn Curtiss. Beginning in the late 1970s, the house was subject to vandalism and a number of fires. 

Fair Haven Nursing Home is one of the oldest buildings in Miami Springs and is built in the pueblo style favored during the initial development. The building was designed by architect Bernard E. Muller. It was designated a Miami Springs Historic Site in 1984.

Back in 1927, Fair Havens Retirement Center was Miami Springs founder Glenn Curtiss’ masterpiece. But it was never added to the National Registry of Historic Places, according to documents obtained from the U.S. Department of Interior’s National Park Service by Miami Herald reporter Theo Karantsalis. [Miami Springs landmark sold for $29 million. Its historic designation is in question 

A simple timeline of events:
*1926 - Country Club Estates incorporated
*1927 - Hotel Country Club officially opened
*1930 - Miami-Battle Creek Sanitarium opened
*1942 - Sanitarium leased to US Army
*1945 - Sanitarium reopens
*1959 - Miami-Battle Creek Sanitarium becomes The Palm Spa
*1962 – Renamed Fair Havens Center
*2020 - Fair Havens sold. Miami Herald shows site not deemed historic.
Before becoming a nursing home, the building served as the Hotel Country Club. The hotel was built by Glenn Curtiss and partners, and was intended to promote the development of the then-new Country Club Estates. It was furnished in a Southwestern style, with Navajo rugs on the floor and handcrafted solid mahogany furniture. In 1929, after the crash, Curtiss sold the hotel to his friend John Harvey Kellogg, who renamed it the &quot;Miami Battle Creek Sanitarium&quot; and operated for many years. During World War II, it served the Air Transport Command as a hospital for recuperating military personnel. Later it became a home for the elderly, which it still is today.

<text>Naranja is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. Many orange groves were once located in this area, so the community name came from the Spanish word for orange, &quot;naranja&quot;, though the pronunciation among the local residents is &quot;Na-Ran-Jah&quot;. Naranja was also a stop for the Florida East Coast Railroad that once ran through this area. It is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. The population was 13,509 at the 2020 census, up from 8,303 in 2010.

==Geography==

<text>North Miami is a suburban city located in northeast Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States, about north of Miami. The city lies on Biscayne Bay and hosts the Biscayne Bay Campus of Florida International University. Originally the &quot;Town of Arch Creek&quot;, the area was incorporated as the &quot;Town of Miami Shores&quot;, which was renamed the &quot;Town of North Miami&quot; in 1931. It was reincorporated as a city in 1953. The city is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida.

The city is also home to the Oleta River State Park, which is the state&#x27;s largest urban park.

, the population recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau is 60,191. North Miami is the seventh largest city in Miami-Dade County.

==History==

===Early history===
In the final phase of Indian inhabitation of the area that eventually became &quot;North Miami&quot;, United States Army soldiers in 1856 cut a Military Trail through nearly impassable thickets and rivers connecting Fort Lauderdale to Fort Dallas at the mouth of the Miami River. This eight-foot trail, Dade County’s first roadway, crossed a unique natural bridge—a natural limestone bridge spanning across the creek that no longer stands in Arch Creek Memorial Park—in an area that would attract a settlement that early on would be known as &quot;Arch Creek&quot;. Even before 1890, a handful of adventuresome pioneers spent brief periods around the Arch Creek Natural Bridge, a centuries-old Indian settlement.

In 1891, Mr. Ilhe was the first to put down roots in the Arch Creek vicinity. He purchased from the State of Florida at one dollar an acre in the area of today’s N.E. 116th Street and Biscayne Boulevard. The place was so remote that his nearest northern neighbor was thought to live in Ft. Lauderdale. Mr. Ihle built a temporary palmetto frond shelter. During the next 27 years he grew shallots, coontie, squashes, bananas, sugar cane, Puerto Rican pineapples, lemons, guavas, limes, rose apples, Jamaican apples, and tomatoes.

By 1905 the area surrounding the nine-year-old Arch Creek Railroad Depot had become the community’s hub. It was located at 125th Street and the F.E.C. tracks. That year a post office and a school were opened nearby. By 1912, eighteen homes, a church, a general store, a blacksmith shop, and two tomato packing houses were located around the railroad. The population was estimated at less than one hundred. Farming was still the principal occupation.

The Florida land boom that was underway in the 1920s spread to the Arch Creek farming community. The Biscayne Canal was dug in 1924 to remove farmland from flooded conditions. But as a consequence, the soil began to lose its moisture, and the farming which had been the backbone of the economy was no longer profitable. However, in step with the times, this drained land became available for partitioning, lot sales, and development.

===Birth of North Miami===
Thirty-eight out of the forty-seven registered voters, at the encouragement of developers E.C. Harner, Earl Irons, and Arthur Griffing, showed up and voted to incorporate into a town on February 5, 1926. North Miami, between 1926 and 1931, was named &quot;Town of Miami Shores&quot;, partially because its early eastern boundary was the Atlantic Ocean. The Town limits were: bounded on the south by Miami and Miami Beach, on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by 17th Avenue, and on the north by a line which approximates Golden Glades Drive or 166th Street. Incorporation moved costs from developers to residents and lot purchasers. Late in 1926, a bond issue of $287,000 was passed to build streets, sidewalks, a town hall, a water system, and fire protection.

The devastating September 1926 hurricane burst the real estate land speculation. The local community recovered from the damage, but lot sales came to a stop, and the northern tourist&#x27;s names showed up in great numbers on the delinquent tax list. Some money from the bond issue was used to build a Spanish-Mediterranean style city hall building at N.E. 8th Avenue and 125th Street in 1928. The City Hall also housed the police and fire departments. In the 1930s a new water plant and gravity tank were installed behind City Hall. The first newspaper, &quot;The Miami Shores Bulletin&quot;, was published in 1927–1928 and chronicled the events of the times. The historic William Jennings Bryan school was constructed in 1928 on the same spot where the Arch Creek Elementary School had burned down the year before.

===The 1930s===
Seven miles (11 km) of Atlantic oceanfront beachland property from the Broward County line southward to Surfside were removed from the town limits as a result of a 1931 Florida Supreme Court decision. The 1926 hurricane ended plans for a causeway to deliver municipal services to that area of town. With no services being received, the beach area instituted a lengthy court lawsuit to separate and form their own community.

The wealthy Shoreland Company, located to the south of the Town, lobbied the 1931 Florida Legislature to officially grant their huge development the name &quot;Village of Miami Shores&quot;. The Legislature did so. It also passed an official act abolishing &quot;Town of Miami Shores&quot; as a name. The next step was for the local population to choose a new name. The municipality was renamed the &quot;Town of North Miami&quot;.

During the Depression years, in 1933, Mrs. Cecille Sevier and Mrs. Ella S. Klefeker became the first two women elected to the Town Council. The 1940s census stated that 1,973 inhabitants lived in the &quot;Town of North Miami&quot;.

===Post World War II growth===
At the end of World War II in 1945, the large and constant influx of former military veterans and their young families changed the face of North Miami by ushering in a great growth period. Homebuilding, road building, shops, stores, and office business construction now continued for decades almost without stopping. By 1951 it was reported nationally that North Miami was one of the fastest-growing towns in the United States. During this time, the growing community needed a high school, so in 1951 construction started for North Miami High School. In August 1954, North Miami High School opened its doors for the children of the growing community.

Partially to meet this challenge of fast growth, the voters of North Miami in 1952 voted to adopt a new charter and a new name. The new charter, enacted as an official statute of the Florida Legislature on May 27, 1953, provided for the establishment of a full-time administrative head (City Manager form of government) to carry out the policies of the elected Mayor/Council. The new and present name officially introduced on this date—the City of North Miami.

North Miami is known for its large Haitian-American population. In 2001, voters made Republican Josaphat Celestin the first Haitian American mayor of a large Miami-Dade County community. In 2009, voters made Democrat and Haitian immigrant Andre Pierre mayor of North Miami. In 2013, voters made Haitian American Lucie Tondreau the city&#x27;s first female Haitian-American Mayor; she soon left office following about being criminally charged. In 2014, voters made Haitian immigrant Dr. Smith Joseph mayor of North Miami. In 2019, voters made Philippe Bien-Aime, who was born in Haiti and migrated to the US in 1993, mayor of North Miami.

==Biscayne Landing==

Biscayne Landing is a mixed use commercial/hotel/residential community being developed on the site of the Munisport Landfill Superfund Site. The city of North Miami will retain ownership of this brownfield site, and the developers, Boca Developers, will retain a 200-year lease for the development of the project.

The master-planned development will feature approximately of commercial office and retail space, 2,800 to 5,000 residential units, a park and recreation facilities. As part of the development agreement for the site, the project&#x27;s developer has also committed to renovating the city&#x27;s library and building a school, Olympic training facility, and affordable housing on several sites located in North Miami. Completion of all elements of the project are projected by 2021.

A portion of the Biscayne Landing site includes some of the wetlands of Biscayne Bay, which will be preserved in the form of a environmental park, containing nature hikes, jogging paths, information plaques that describe the resident wildlife and trees, benches, a canoe landing and a boat house. It will also have connecting trails to Oleta River State Park. This area is the site of a former trash dump and is the home to a large sewage treatment plant nearby.

In 2009, Biscayne Landing was reeling in the real estate downturn. Most of the units in the two buildings online were uninhabited; very few were selling. There is little actual construction on any other project related to their contractual obligations under a redevelopment agreement with the city of North Miami.

Recently the now defunct Biscayne Landing was acquired by the Soffers (Aventura Mall Developers) and LeFranks and together are building SoleMia. This development will be over 1 million square feet and is the largest mixed-use construction project in the U.S.

===Public libraries===

The North Miami public library is the city&#x27;s library. While over the years the county wide Miami-Dade Public Library System has taken over the libraries of most of the cities in the county, the North Miami public library has remained independent.
The North Miami Public Library was first opened in 1932 by the Biscayne Park Woman&#x27;s Club. When the library first opened it was located at the City of North Miami&#x27;s town hall under the supervision of E.May Avil the City Clerk. The library was closed during World War II and it was reopened in September 1945 in the same location at the town hall and still under the supervision of the City Clerk E. May Avil. At this time the library was funded by donations and member fees.
&quot;In 1948 the Biscayne Park Woman’s Club turned the library over to the city of North Miami and in 1949 a public referendum established a free Public Library under provisions of the Florida Statutes, setting up a Library Fund and a Library board to administer the operation. Twin sisters, Mrs. Edla Lunden and Mrs. Alma Anderson, were appointed as Librarian and Assistant Librarian, respectively&quot;. After the twins retired, Miss Phyllis Gray served from 1955 to 1959 as the library&#x27;s first professional Librarian. Today Paul Bazile is the current Library Director.
In the fall of 2003 the North Miami Public Library&#x27;s Director signed a Reciprocal Borrowing Agreement with the public library directors of the cities of North Miami Beach, Hialeah and the Miami-Dade Public Library System thereby allowing their patrons free access to the participating libraries. Today the library is undergoing a $1.5 million renovation and the main building is closed to the public, limited library services are available from an annex building next to the main building. The library re-opening is planned for some time in June or July 2015. Library information can be accessed at the library&#x27;s website.

<text>North Miami Beach (commonly referred to as NMB) is a city in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. The City of North Miami Beach is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. Originally named &quot;Fulford-by-the-Sea&quot; in 1926, after Captain William H. Fulford of the U.S. Coast Guard, the city was renamed &quot;North Miami Beach&quot; in 1931. The population was 43,676 at the 2020 US census.

==History==
The first non-indigenous settlement was platted in 1881, and was called Fulford-By-The-Sea.

In the 1920s, Carl G. Fisher built an all-wooden racetrack with stands for 12,000 spectators, known as the Fulford–Miami Speedway. This event, held on February 22, 1926, dubbed the Carl G. Fisher Cup Race, was a forerunner to the auto races at Sebring and Daytona. In September 1926, after just one race, the track was destroyed by the 1926 Miami Hurricane.

The hurricane of 1926 essentially ended the South Florida real estate boom, and in an effort to alleviate their losses and the damage to the city, local residents came together as the Town of Fulford. In 1927, it was incorporated as the City of Fulford.

North Miami Beach is governed by a commission-manager system in the form of a Mayor, Commission, and a professional City Manager.

===Public libraries===
North Miami Beach Public Library (NMB Library), also referred to as the Lafe Allen Public Library, is a 23,000 square foot facility located at 1601 NE 164th Street in North Miami Beach, Florida. The library&#x27;s collection currently contains over 60,000 items, including both fiction and non-fiction materials, DVDs, audio books, compact discs, newspapers, magazines, and foreign language materials. Digital services include access to e-materials and reference resources, such as Florida Electronic Library, Newsbank, Reference USA, World Book, NoveList Plus, and more.

In 1959, the North Miami Beach Library was initially opened inside of a storefront on NE 163rd Street as a branch of the Miami-Dade Public Library System (then known as the City of Miami Library system). This location was relocated and expanded to two storefronts at the corner of NE 19th Avenue and NE 169th Street the following year. In 1961, however, the city ended its attachment with the City of Miami Library system and became an independent library. During this time, the library was merely a staff of two. The staff had a minor budget of 25,000 to build the collection for the library. After residents of the City of North Miami Beach voted to build a permanent location for the library in 1964, a new building was constructed on 164th Street and opened in 1965. Renovations to this facility in 1981 and 1994 grew the branch from its original 10,000 square feet to make room for the library&#x27;s expanding collection. The last reservation took place in 1994 and granted the facility its current dimensions at over 23,000 square feet. 

The NMB Library offers a variety of services to the residents of North Miami Beach, such as access to study and meeting rooms, employment resources, early literacy programs, voter registration forms, citizenship materials, and passport assistance. Computers, printers, copiers, scanners, and fax machine services are also available. The library&#x27;s dedicated teen area, known as the Discovery District, is a space specifically designed to provide library patrons aged 13–19 with a place to read, study, or work on school projects. Access to computers, 3D printers, virtual reality, and zSpace for educational and recreational purposes is also provided.

<text>Ojus is a census-designated place and formerly incorporated town in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. The population was 19,673 at the 2020 census, up from 18,036 in 2010.

==History==
People have been living in the Ojus area for thousands of years. Paleo-Indians have been documented in South Florida dating back to over 13,000 years ago. Archaeologists have uncovered ancient sites at Arch Creek and along the Oleta River. According to archaeologist Robert Carr, although the largest Tequesta settlement was located at the mouth of the Miami River, by 750 BCE approximately 100 Native Americans routinely inhabited the local area which was just a one-hour canoe trip north of the main settlement. The Oleta River, which cuts through Ojus, was one of the Tequesta&#x27;s primary &quot;roadways&quot; for millennia. Subsequent people, to include Seminoles, European explorers, and early settlers, would also use the Oleta River to traverse from Miami to the New River in Ft. Lauderdale.

During the late nineteenth century, settlers established farms along the Oleta River. These settlers grew peas, beans, sugar cane, and tomatoes. Seminoles set up a trading post near present-day Greynolds Park to conduct business with the Ojus settlers. In 1897, Albert Fitch named the area &quot;Ojus&quot; after the Seminole word for &quot;plenty&quot; or &quot;lots of&quot;. After the turn of the century, rock was discovered in the area that was ideal for road building. Many of the neighborhood lakes were created during the early part of the twentieth century to support the construction of the area&#x27;s infrastructure.

State representative Graham W. King lived in Ojus.

Voters initially approved the Town of Ojus on 4/12/1926 only to have this set aside by the state supreme court due to invalid boundary specifications. A second vote for incorporation was approved by voters on 8/31/1926. In 1927, the Town of Ojus was abolished by the state as a municipal government and re-established as a municipal corporation, along with other charter changes. In 1929, a court upheld the city council&#x27;s refusal of the mayor&#x27;s order for a charter election. Subsequently the state passed a bill calling for the abolishment of the town, which was rejected by voters. In 1931, the state abolished the Town of Ojus with voter approval on 7/15/1931. A court rescinded this on 10/26/1933 due to the outstanding debt associated with the town. The town was dissolved on 8/8/1935 after the state again abolished the town with voters approving on 8/6/1935. This time, the state was explicit regarding the handling of, and a mechanism to eliminate, the town&#x27;s debt.

Two landmarks were created in the early part of the twentieth century, but only one survives. In 1925, Carl Fischer constructed the Fulford–Miami Speedway in the present-day Sky Lake neighborhood. The wooden race track was then billed as the world&#x27;s fastest. It was unfortunately destroyed by the devastating 1926 hurricane. One of the region&#x27;s most notable features, Greynolds Park, was established in 1936 as part of President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) &quot;New Deal&quot; programs. The park was named after Mr. A.O. Greynolds, owner of the Ojus Rock Company, who donated of his property in exchange for naming the park after him. Over the years, the park has expanded to include a golf course and a boathouse, and even hosted popular musical acts during the 1960s such as the Grateful Dead. Greynolds Park was declared a historic site in 1983.

On June 6, 2006, the Ojus Urban Area District (OUAD) was formed as a result of recommendations in the Ojus Charrette Report to plan for the future of the Ojus Area in response to a request for a planning report for Ojus.

In 2018, county referendum 6 narrowly failed to form a new municipality from portions of Ojus, Skylake and Highland Lakes.

<text>Opa-locka () is a city in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. Spanning roughly , it is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. As of the 2020 Census, the population was 16,463, up from 15,219 in 2010.

Opa-locka was founded in 1926 by American aviator and industrialist Glenn Curtiss, who was inspired by the Middle Eastern folk tales of the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights.&quot; As such, the city has the largest collection of Moorish Revival architecture in the Western Hemisphere, and many of its roads bear names such as Sharazad Boulevard, Sinbad Avenue, Sabur Lane, Sultan Avenue, Ali Baba Avenue, Perviz Avenue, and Sesame Street.

The name &quot;Opa-locka&quot; is an abbreviation of a Seminole place name, Opa-tisha-wocka-locka, meaning &quot;wooded hummock&quot;, &quot;high, dry hummock&quot;, or &quot;a big island covered with many trees and swamps&quot;. 

==History==
Opa-locka was founded in 1926 by aviation pioneer Glenn Curtiss, who had retired to become a real estate developer during the nascent Florida land boom. The city&#x27;s unique &quot;Arabian&quot; or &quot;Moorish&quot; architectural theme was executed by American architect Bernhardt E. Muller, who had designed several Mediterranean and Spanish-style homes in nearby Miami in 1923. There are various accounts regarding how Opa-locka came to adopt its iconic architectural style. Curtiss had met Muller in 1925 at the suggestion of Curtiss&#x27; mother, Lua Andrews Curtiss. Muller is said to have viewed Opa-locka as an opportunity to create a new community based on an architectural theme from a literary work; he was particularly inspired by the exoticism and splendor of the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights,&quot; also known in English as the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;. By some accounts, Muller met with Curtiss on the site of the future city to describe his concept for an architectural design inspired by individual stories of the Arabian Nights; other sources indicate that Curtiss was inspired by his own reading of &quot;Arabian Nights,&quot; or by the 1924 film &quot;The Thief of Baghdad,&quot; which was adapted from the story&quot;.&quot;

Opa-locka&#x27;s overall design and layout was conceived by New York planner and architect Clinton McKenzie, who drew heavily from the contemporary &quot;Garden City Movement&quot;, which called for satellite communities centered on residences, industry, and agriculture but connected to a central hub and interspersed with greenbelts. Opa-locka became a self-contained community with a hotel, zoo park, golf course, archery club, swimming pool, airport, and train station. On May 14, 1926, it was officially chartered as a town by 28 registered voters, although much of it remained under construction.

Opa-locka was largely spared by the Great Miami hurricane that devasted much of South Florida in September 1926. While the storm ended the Florida land boom and reduced the influx of residents and capital, the town continued to develop; by the end of the year, at least 62 buildings were complete and another 31 were under construction. Ultimately, a total of 86 to 105 buildings were built in the &quot;Neo-Moorish&quot; or Moorish Revival style that had first emerged in Europe and North America in the late 19th century; common characteristics included onion-shaped domes, minarets, crenelated parapets, Saracenic arches, watchtowers, mosaic tile, and outdoor spiral staircases. Several Moorish-style buildings have survived, of which twenty are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Opa-locka Thematic Resource Area.

On January 8, 1927, as part of an effort to drive growth and generate interest, Opa-locka held its inaugural &quot;Arabian Nights Fantasy&quot;, which included dignitaries such as Florida Governor John Martin. Many residents dressed in Arabian-styled theatrical costumes shipped down from New York. The festivities also marked the opening of Opa-locka train station—billed as the &quot;grand Vizier of the Sheikdom of Opa-locka&quot;—and the inaugural run of the Seaboard Airline Railroad&#x27;s famous &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot;, a deluxe passenger train that would run from New York to Miami in winter. Though largely promotional in its origins, the Arabian Nights Fantasy has since become an annual event centered on promoting civic pride and community.

In 1933, the U.S. Navy opened a base at the Opa-locka Airport, which helped drive the city&#x27;s growth. With the closure of the base in the 1950s, Opa-locka experienced a decline.

In the 1980s, Opa-locka transitioned from majority white to majority African American and was seen as a pioneer in black empowerment in northern Dade County, where neighboring cities (North Miami, North Miami Beach, Miami Gardens, and Golden Glades) were undergoing a similar racial shift. In 1943, Opa-Locka hired its first black police officer. In 1972, the first black city commissioner was elected, Albert Tresvant, who then went on to serve as the first black mayor of Opa-Locka in 1975.

Opa-locka was the first community in the United States to commemorate the election of Barack Obama as the country&#x27;s first African American president. A mile-long section of Perviz Avenue—from Oriental Boulevard to Ali Baba Avenue—was renamed &quot;Barack Obama Avenue&quot; on February 17, 2009.
In addition to the unique buildings, Opa-locka has a large general aviation airport, three parks, two lakes and a railroad station which is currently the tri-rail station. The city is a mixture of residential, commercial and industrial zones. Opa-locka was the backdrop for several films, including &quot;Salesman&quot;, &quot;Living Dreams&quot;, &quot;Texas Justice&quot;, &quot;Bad Boys II,&quot; and &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot;.

===2016 financial emergency===
On June 1, 2016, then-Florida Governor Rick Scott issued Executive Order Number 16-135, declaring the City of Opa-Locka to be in a state of &quot;Financial Emergency&quot; under Florida Statute Section 218.503. According to the Executive Order, the Opa-Locka City Commission requested that the governor declare the financial emergency, the state and the City of Opa-Locka were to execute a State and Local Agreement of Cooperation, and the government would appoint a Financial Emergency Board. On the same day, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; reported that &quot;Millions of dollars are in arrears as the city teeters on the edge of bankruptcy&quot; and that &quot;city officials remain under an FBI corruption investigation&quot;. The article also reported that this financial emergency was the second declared for the city since 2002.

Just over a week earlier, Opa-locka Commissioner Terence Pinder apparently drove his SUV into a tree at high speed, killing himself. He was scheduled to turn himself over to prosecutors the next day, having faced bribery charges.

On June 10, Governor Scott named the Financial Emergency Board. The City of Opa-locka does not have an Audit Committee to help select the public accountant to perform the independent audited financial statements, as required by Florida Statute 218.391(2)

==Miami Municipal Airport==
Amelia Earhart launched her historic trip around the world from Miami Municipal Airport, established by the city&#x27;s founder, aviation pioneer Glenn Curtiss, then located in what is now the southern part of Opa-locka. 

==Opa-locka Airport==
The German dirigible &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; visited Naval Air Station Miami, which later became Opa-locka Airport, as a regular stop on its Germany-Brazil-United States-Germany scheduled route.

In the 1950s, the Opa-locka airport—specifically Building 67—became the site of a large CIA operation, PBSuccess, run by operatives including E. Howard Hunt. The operation helped launch the U.S.-led coup in Guatemala in 1954 and was a precursor to the Bay of Pigs Invasion in 1961. The airfield center then served as a listening post for Cuba until the 82nd Airborne took over Opa-locka Airbase during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

==Geography==

==Government==

The city of Opa-locka was incorporated in 1926 and operates under a commission/city manager form of government. The city commission consists of the mayor and four commissioners, who are responsible for enacting ordinances, resolutions, and regulations governing the city, and appointing the members of various advisory boards, the city manager, city attorney, and city clerk. As chief administrative officer, the city manager is responsible for the enforcement of laws and ordinances, and the appointment and supervision of the city&#x27;s department heads. Municipal services include police, sanitation, water and sewer services, storm water services, maintenance of streets and infrastructure, and recreational activities. The financial reporting entity, under which the financial statements are prepared, includes all the activities and functions for which the city is financially accountable.

The federal government has been investigating the city&#x27;s government since at least 2013. In 2014, auditors reported that basic bookkeeping was non-existent. The &quot;Miami Herald&quot; reported the mayor and other officials were using city funds for their own benefit. In 2016, the city manager and public works supervisor were arrested, charged with extortion of money in exchange for city permits. Both quickly pled guilty. The city&#x27;s water system had been used by city workers as means of collecting money for their own use. In August 2016 the city asked the county to take over the system.

===Police===
The city is served by the Opa-Locka Police Department. The department has an authorized force of 54 sworn officers and 10 civilian support staff. Since 2022, the chief of police has been Scott Israel, a former Broward County Sheriff who was hired in 2022 to replace acting police chief Michael Steel, who had been in the position since Steve Barreira resigned in late October 2021 after just months on the job. In 2019, Israel In a 2013 editorial, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; called the city &quot;crime-plagued&quot; and the police department &quot;deeply troubled&quot;. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suspended Israel from his Broward County position in 2019 (replacing him with Gregory Tony), citing Israel&#x27;s responses to the Fort Lauderdale airport shooting and the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.

==Crime==
In 2004, Opa-locka had the highest rate of violent crime for any city in the United States. Calvin Godfrey wrote, in a 2009 &quot;Miami New Times&quot; article, that Opa-locka was &quot;mired in crime and sinking fast.&quot; He wrote that the police department, whose headcount had decreased from 50 to 16, had been &quot;steadily deteriorating&quot; for the 20-year period leading up to 2009. The &quot;Miami New Times&quot; received memorandums that, in Godfrey&#x27;s words, &quot;reveal an agency rife with controversy&quot;.

In January 2005, after negative Florida Department of Law Enforcement evaluations of the Opa-locka police force surfaced, the Miami-Dade Police Department sent county commissioner Barbara Jordan a report that projected it would cost $7 million per period to take over the Opa-locka police duties. In 2005, Opa-locka allocated $3.5 million to its officers. Jannie Beverly, Opa-locka&#x27;s city manager, fired police chief James Wright in January 2008 after he was accused of corruption. In a 2013 editorial, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; called the city &quot;crime-plagued&quot; and the police department &quot;deeply troubled&quot;.

<doc id="109464" wikidata="Q3286127" url="?curid=109464" title="Pinecrest, Florida">
<text>Pinecrest is a suburban village in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. The village is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population was 18,388.

Pinecrest is governed by a five-member village council and operates under the council-manager form of government. 33156, the ZIP code that encompasses most of the village, has been consistently ranked as one of the wealthiest in the United States by income. Based on the median home listing price in recent years at $4,300,000, Pinecrest has been ranked as one of the most expensive cities in Florida to purchase a home in. 
==History==
During the 1900s, Miami pioneer and railroad tycoon Henry Flagler used the property at U.S. 1 and Southwest 102 Street as a staging area during the construction of the Overseas Railroad to the Florida Keys.

In the 1930s, the area&#x27;s growth continued and the community began to evolve around one of the first tourist attractions established in the Miami vicinity – Parrot Jungle and Gardens. Parrot Jungle was founded in 1936 by Franz and Louise Scherr on property located at Red Road and Southwest 111 Street and over the years has become a tourist attraction whose visitors included Winston Churchill. The idea for Parrot Jungle began after Scherr, who owned and operated a feed and supply store in Homestead, and became intrigued with the idea of building an attraction where birds would &quot;fly free&quot;. To bring his vision to life, he rented of hammock land for an annual fee of $25 (equivalent to $476.92 in 2021). Parrot Jungle was built as a winding nature trail dug through the coral rock and hammock land, indigenous to the area. All the natural plants were left undisturbed. The entrance was built on Red Road. The attraction opened on December 20, 1936, to about 100 visitors. Each paid 25 cents admission to see and hear Scherr talk about his birds, trees and flowers. Since 1936, Parrot Jungle has attracted over a million visitors. On December 17, 2002, the Village of Pinecrest purchased the Parrot Jungle with the aim of developing the site as Pinecrest Gardens. On March 8, 2003, the Pinecrest Village Council dedicated Pinecrest Gardens and officially opened it to the public as the village&#x27;s newest municipal park. The attraction moved to a new waterfront location on Watson Island between downtown Miami and Miami Beach. It was relaunched as Parrot Jungle Island.

The Miami Serpentarium, a tourist attraction that featured snakes, lizards and other reptiles and amphibians, was located on US 1 for many decades prior to closing in the mid-1980s.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the area flourished with the development and construction of ranch-style houses on lots which laid the foundation for the community&#x27;s rural and lushly landscaped residential character.

While still an unincorporated area of Miami-Dade County, what is now Pinecrest was the site of the 1986 FBI Miami shootout. The shootout took place near 12201 Southwest 82nd Avenue.
In August 1992, Pinecrest and the surrounding South Miami-Dade area were devastated by the effects of Hurricane Andrew. Many of the homes and businesses in the area were destroyed. In the subsequent years, the area was slowly rebuilt.

Rapid growth and local issues during the 1990s inspired a movement led by residents Evelyn Greer Langlieb and Gary C. Matzner to incorporate the area. The Village of Pinecrest was officially incorporated on March 12, 1996. Evelyn Greer was elected the first mayor and was succeeded, after serving two terms, by Matzner in 2004. The founding village council, including Greer, Cindie Blanck, Barry Blaxberg, Leslie Bowe, Robert Hingston, together with Village Manager Peter G. Lombardi and Village Clerk Guido Inguanzo, are credited with establishing well-regarded municipal services including police, parks and recreation, building and planning services, and public works.

<text>Pinewood is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. The population was 17,246 at the 2020 census.

Most of Pinewood was originally a neighborhood of the City of Miami, annexed into the city in 1925. With the arrival of the Great Depression, Miami gave up its jurisdiction and Pinewood became an unincorporated area of Miami-Dade County.

==Geography==
Pinewood is located north of downtown Miami. It is bordered to the north by the city of North Miami, to the east by Miami Shores and unincorporated neighborhoods, to the south and southwest by unincorporated West Little River, and to the northwest by unincorporated Westview. U.S. Route 441 (NW 7th Avenue) forms most of the eastern border of Pinewood.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 7.30%, are water.

<text>Derwent Valley Mills is a World Heritage Site along the River Derwent in Derbyshire, England, designated in December 2001. It is administered by the Derwent Valley Mills Partnership. The modern factory, or &#x27;mill&#x27;, system was born here in the 18th century to accommodate the new technology for spinning cotton developed by Richard Arkwright. With advancements in technology, it became possible to produce cotton continuously. The system was adopted throughout the valley, and later spread so that by 1788 there were over 200 Arkwright-type mills in Britain. Arkwright&#x27;s inventions and system of organising labour was exported to Europe and the United States.

Water-power was first introduced to England by John Lombe at his silk mill in Derby in 1719, but it was Richard Arkwright who applied water-power to the process of producing cotton in the 1770s. His patent of a water frame allowed cotton to be spun continuously, meaning it could be produced by unskilled workers. Cromford Mill was the site of Arkwright&#x27;s first mill, with nearby Cromford village significantly expanded for his then-new workforce; this system of production and workers&#x27; housing was copied throughout the valley. To ensure the presence of a labour force, it was necessary to construct housing for the mill workers. Thus, new settlements were established by mill owners around the mills – sometimes developing a pre-existing community – with their own amenities such as schools, chapels, and markets. Most of the housing still exists and is still in use. Transport infrastructure was built to open new markets for the mills&#x27; produce.

Mills and workers&#x27; settlements were established at Belper, Darley Abbey, and Milford by Arkwright&#x27;s competitors. Arkwright-type mills were so successful that sometimes they were copied without paying royalties to Richard Arkwright.

The cotton industry in the Derwent Valley went into decline in the first quarter of the 19th century as the market shifted towards Lancashire which was better positioned in relation to markets and raw materials. The mills and their associated buildings are well preserved and have been reused since the cotton industry declined. Many of the buildings within the World Heritage Site are also listed buildings and Scheduled Monuments. Some of the mills now contain museums and are open to the public.

The Derwent Valley Trust is now involved in the creation of a cycle-way running the entire length of the World Heritage site to promote sustainable tourism and travel.

==Location and coverage==
The Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site covers an area of and spans a stretch of the Derwent Valley, in Derbyshire, from Matlock Bath in the north to Derby city centre in the south. Within the site are mill complexes, settlements including workers&#x27; housing, weirs on the River Derwent, and the transport network that supported the mills in the valley. The site consists of the communities of Cromford, Belper, Milford, and Darley Abbey, and includes 838 listed buildings, made up of 16 Grade I, 42 Grade II*, and 780 Grade II. A further nine structures are Scheduled Ancient Monuments. The buildings are a mixture of mills, workers&#x27; housing, and structures associated with the mill communities. The Cromford Canal and Cromford and High Peak Railway, which aided the industrialisation of the area, are also part of the World Heritage Site.

==History==

In the late 17th century silk making expanded due to demand for silk as part of fashionable garments. In an attempt to increase production through the use of water power, Thomas Cotchett commissioned engineer George Sorocold to build a mill near the centre of Derby on an island in the River Derwent. Although the experiment was unsuccessful, it convinced John Lombe – an employee of Cotchett – that if water power could be perfected there was a market for its produce. He engaged in industrial espionage and gained plans of Italian machines. He patented the design in 1719 and built a five-storey mill next to Crotchett&#x27;s mill. By 1763, 30 years after Lombe&#x27;s patent had expired, only seven Lombe mills had been built because the silk market was small, but Lombe had introduced a viable form of water powered machinery and had established a template for organised labour that later industrialists would follow.
As silk was a luxury good, the market was small and easily saturated by machine produced goods. The next innovation in machine produced textiles came in the cotton industry which had a much wider market and produced more affordable goods. Spinning cotton was a more complex process than silk production. The water frame for spinning cotton was developed by Richard Arkwright and patented in 1769. The machines could spin yarn continuously and replaced skilled workers with unskilled supervisors to make sure the machines did not break. Water frames varied in size from 4 to 96 spindles. For these reasons, the water frame became popular and widespread. In 1771, Richard Arkwright took a lease on land in Cromford. By 1774, his first mill was operational, and in 1776 he began construction of a second mill at Cromford. During this time, he developed machines for pre-spinning and in 1775 took out his second patent. With spinning mechanised, the other processes involved in producing cotton could not keep up and also required mechanisation. He produced a machine for carding, the process which laid out the cotton fibres parallel, however not all his inventions were successful and cleaning the cotton was performed by hand until the 1790s when an effective machine was invented.

Arkwright sought financial assistance, and Peter Nightingale – a local landowner (and grand uncle of Florence Nightingale) – bought the Cromford Estate for £20,000 (£ as of ). Nightingale also built Rock House as a residence for Arkwright, overlooking the mill, and gave him a further £2,000 (£) to build the second mill and £1,750 (£) for workers&#x27; housing. Between 1777 and 1783, Arkwright and his family built mills at Bakewell, Cressbrook, Rocester, and Wirksworth, spread across Derbyshire and Staffordshire. Jedediah Strutt, who was Arkwright&#x27;s partner in the first Cromford Mill, built mills at Belper and Milford in 1776–1781. Thomas Evans, a landowner in Darley Abbey, bought a further in the area around Darley Abbey at a cost of £1,140 (£) and in 1782 built a cotton mill in the village. Arkwright was paid royalties by those who had copied his machines, although some people risked prosecution by engaging in piracy.

The construction of Masson Mill in Matlock Bath began in 1783, instigated by Arkwright. Contemporaneous with Arkwright&#x27;s expansionism was the entry of Jedediah Strutt into the cotton spinning industry. Strutt had the advantage that Arkwright had already done all the necessary experimentation with machinery, so he did not have to invest in researching new technology. He established a mill at Belper, about south of Cromford; it was probably complete in 1781. The site was expanded with the addition of a second mill in 1784. Strutt also built a mill in Milford, about south of Belper. By 1793, two further mills were added for printing and bleaching. The Strutts estimated that by 1789 they had invested £37,000 (£) in theirs mills at Belper and Milford (£26,000 at Belper and £11,000 at Milford), and had a return of £36,000 (£) per year.
Arkwright had a reputation as a paternalistic employer who was concerned for the well-being of his employees and their families. A Sunday School was built at Cromford in 1785 and provided education to 200 children. By 1789, the Cromford Estate was back in the ownership of the Arkwrights, who actively influenced its structure and construction. Cromford was given a market place to act as a new focus for the village. Arkwright organised a market every Sunday and as incentive to attend, gave annual prizes to those who attended most often. After Arkwright died in 1792 his son, Richard Arkwright junior, took over and sold most of his cotton mills outside Cromford and Matlock Bath. The mills in Cromford and Matlock Bath were probably retained to support the Willersley Estate. Societies and clubs were created in Cromford. The religious affairs of the community were of less interest to Arkwright, and it was not until 1797 that Arkwright junior established Cromford Church; his father had envisaged it as a private chapel for the Arkwright family at Willersley Castle. The family&#x27;s attempts to make Cromford self-sustaining through establishing a market was successful, and the village expanded until about 1840. This was even though the mills had passed their zenith and begun to enter decline in this period.
Richard Arkwright junior was uninterested in the cotton business, and after the death of his father the Arkwright family ceased to invest in the industry. The Strutt family continued to invest, fuelled by the profits of their mills in Milford and Belper. They continued building mills into the 1810s, and by 1833 their business employed 2,000 people and had dominated the cotton industry in the Derwent Valley. As Arkwright had done at Cromford, the Strutts provided housing for their employees. Belper was already an established village with its own market before Jedediah Strutt began building mills, so he was not required to have as active a role in developing the community into a self-sustaining entity as Richard Arkwright did at Cromford. The Strutts provided education, and in 1817 650 and 300 children attended Sunday Schools in Belper and Milford respectively. Compared with Cromford, whose population had plateaued at around 1,200 in the early 19th century, the population of Belper rose from 4,500 in 1801 to 7,890 in 1831 due to the prosperity of the business. Darley Abbey also expanded as a worker&#x27;s settlement although it had no market place, so providing food for the inhabitants was problematic. The settlement doubled in size between 1788 and 1801, and between 1801 and 1831 the population increased from 615 to 1,170 with the addition of much worker&#x27;s housing. A Sunday School for 80 children was established in one of the mills and a church and school were built in 1819 and 1826 respectively.

Despite being a major power of the cotton industry in the first quarter of the 19th century, the Strutts&#x27; company began to lose out to competition from Lancashire mill towns. The problem of shifting markets affected the entire Derwent Valley; Lancashire was better situated than Derbyshire in relation to the raw materials and new markets. The mills run by the Strutt family also suffered from a lack of modernisation; although they were at the forefront of fireproofing technology at the start of the 19th century, as the machines the mills used got bigger and more powerful, the Strutts persevered with child labour where adults would have been more adept at using the machinery. The company declined and in the second half of the 19th century some of its mills were leased or sold off to other companies. Although the cotton industry in the Derwent Valley declined, many of the structures associated with the industrial processes associated with producing cotton and workers&#x27; housing has survived and there are 848 listed buildings in the World Heritage Site.

==Transport==

===Cromford canal===
The Erewash Canal, begun in 1777, was intended to primarily transport coal. It flowed from the River Trent in Sawley to Langley Mill, south of Cromford. In 1788, Richard Arkwright asked William Jessop to estimate the cost of building a canal connecting the mills at Cromford to Langley Mill. The figure Jessop came up with was £42,000 (£ as of ) which was raised within a couple of weeks. Local mill owners Jedediah Strutt and Thomas Evans opposed the proposed canal, fearing it would interfere with the water supply for their own mills, but in 1789 Parliament granted permission to construct the canal.

When the Cromford Canal was opened in 1794, it had cost nearly twice Jessop&#x27;s original estimate. Between Langley Mill and Cromford Wharf, where the canal terminated in the mill complex, the canal crossed two aqueducts, traversed of tunnel beneath some ironworks at Bull Bridge, and fourteen locks. Three-quarters of the cargo transported on the canal was coal and coke, while the rest consisted of gritstone, iron ore, and lead. When the Derby and Nottingham Canals were completed by Jessop and Benjamin Outram in 1796, they provided direct routes to the important textile centres of Derby and Nottingham. In January 1845, the Cromford Canal Company decided to have a permanent pump built to provide enough water during dry conditions. This was made by Graham and Company at the Milton Iron Works, Elsecar. The canal was successful until the mid 19th century when the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway extended its line south of the canal. In 1852, the canal was sold to the railway company which accelerated its decline. By 1889 the canal was mostly used for local traffic. It was eventually closed in 1944 as the costs of maintaining and repairing the canal were too great. Derbyshire County Council acquired the canal in 1974 and the Cromford Canal Society undertook the task of restoring it.

===Cromford and High Peak Railway===
In the early 19th century, a canal had been proposed to connect the Peak Forest Canal, which terminated at Whaley Bridge, with the Cromford Canal, providing a direct route between markets in Lancashire and Derbyshire. However, costs were prohibitive and the plan was abandoned. Josias Jessop, the son of William Jessop, believed that a wagonway would be much cheaper than a canal. On 2 May 1825 an Act of Parliament for the construction of a railway from Cromford to Whaley Bridge was passed. The proposal – backed by William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire, Richard Arkwright junior, and several Manchester bankers – was ambitious; it was expected that steam locomotives would be used on the line, even though the technology was in its infancy and George Stephenson did not build his revolutionary &quot;Rocket&quot; until 1829. The south part of the railway, from Cromford Wharf to Hurdlow, south east of Buxton, opened on 29 May 1830, and on 6 July 1831 the rest of the line opened to Whaley Bridge. The first steam locomotive on the line was introduced in 1841; before that, the traffic had been made up entirely of wagons.

The railway ascended from above sea level at Cromford Wharf to a height of above sea level at Ladmanlow, before descending to at the wharves of the Peak Forest Canal. The changes in height, which would have necessitated many locks for a canal, was relatively easy for a railway. However, for a time the Cromford and High Peak Railway did have the sharpest curve out of all railways in Britain and the steepest incline for vehicles without steam power. The construction of the railway cost was £180,000, higher than the original estimate of £155,000 (£ and £ respectively as of ) but much lower than the £500,000 the canal was predicted to cost (£ as of ). Having been built to connect the Peak Forest and Cromford Canals, the railways fortunes were closely tied with those of the canals. The line was not profitable as by the time it had opened traffic had declined along the Cromford Canal. In 1855, an Act of Parliament allowed the line to transport passengers as well as freight. Although passenger travel became more important to the railway, it went into decline and closed on 21 April 1967.

==Legacy==

The Derwent Valley is considered the birthplace of the factory system. The machines developed in the Derwent Valley such as the water frame allowed continuous production. Richard Arkwright&#x27;s Cromford Mill and the associated workers&#x27; settlement provided a template for industrial communities, not just in the valley but internationally. The reason a settlement was built contemporaneously with Cromford Mill was to provide housing for the workers; the only way to secure the labour the mill required was if homes were provided for the labourers and their families. The success of Arkwright&#x27;s model lead to other industrialists copying him. Entrepreneurs such as Peter Nightingale, Jedediah Strutt and Thomas Evans founded the settlements of Belper, Milford, and Darley Abbey within the Derwent Valley for their employees. As well as the economic standpoint of ensuring a supply of labour, the industrialists were also concerned for their employees and families and acted out of a sense of paternalism.

Arkwright&#x27;s innovations were not confined to developing workers&#x27; settlements; he also had patents on many technologies used for water-powered spinning. They were so successful that rival industrialists risked legal action by copying his designs. His patents expired in 1785, and by 1788 over 200 Arkwright type mills had been founded in Britain. New Lanark in Scotland – also a World Heritage Site – was directly influenced by Richard Arkwright and the developments in the Derwent Valley; Lanark was identified as a potential site for a mill on a visit by David Dale and Arkwright in 1784. Dale later established four mills at Lanark; they were structurally similar to Arkwright&#x27;s Masson Mill and at least two of the mills used technology developed in the Derwent Valley, although the factory system was different from that used in the Derwent Valley. New Lanark was acquired by Robert Owen in 1799 who developed paternalism further than had been done in the Derwent Valley, experimenting with education for young and old and social control. Saltaire – another World Heritage Site – was founded in 1853 and featured worker&#x27;s housing and facilities, as well as other elements of the factory system developed by Arkwright.

In 1774, the British government passed an act outlawing the export of &quot;tools or utensils&quot; used in the cotton and linen industries. As a result, the only way for the new technologies being developed in Britain to spread to other countries was through industrial espionage. Carl Delius worked in England and gave plans for many of Arkwright&#x27;s inventions to Johann Gottfried Brugelmann; Brugelmann used the information to establish a mill in Ratingen, near Düsseldorf, which began production in 1784. He named the settlement associated with the mill Cromford. The mill was the first Arkwright mill in mainland Europe. The techniques for spinning cotton developed in the Derwent Valley were also spread to America. In 1790, the United States had fewer than 2,000 spindles which were powered by spinning jennies, compared to 2.4 million machine driven spindles in Britain at the same time. The Arkwright mill was introduced to America by migrants from England, many of whom were unskilled. Among them was Samuel Slater who was from the Derwent Valley and an apprentice of Jedediah Strutt. He founded Slater Mill at Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Many of the technologies developed in the Derwent Valley Mills endured and were adopted for other textile industries; until the mid-20th century, carding was still performed with machinery invented by Richard Arkwright. The factory system made it possible to produce cheap textiles and clothing.

==Preservation==

Out of the Arkwright Festival held in 1971, The Arkwright Society was formed. The Cromford Mill complex was bought by The Arkwright Society in 1979, saving the buildings associated with the mill from demolition. The charity purchased the site for the purpose of conservation and with the intention of beginning restoration. The mills had been contaminated by industrial processes involving pigments and dyes which were stored in the mills after they stopped processing cotton. With the help of local councils, the East Midlands Development Agency, English Heritage, the Heritage Lottery Fund, and at the cost of £5 million, the mills were restored and decontaminated. Now Cromford Mill is now used by small businesses and used for education.

Many of the mills built in the Derwent Valley for the cotton industry survive and were reused after the decline of the industry. Some have been reused. Most of the worker&#x27;s housing survives and is still used as homes. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, local authorities in partnership with English Heritage attempted to prevent the deterioration of the houses and mills by giving advice to owners and using grants to undertake conservation work. When the application for World Heritage Site status was made in 2000, 26 of the 838 listed buildings in the area were on English Heritage&#x27;s At Risk Register and were in a state of disrepair.

In 2000, the Derwent Valley Mills were nominated to become a World Heritage Site. Along with Blaenavon Industrial Landscape, New Lanark, and Saltaire (all now World Heritage Sites), the site was proposed to increase the representation of industrial archaeology on the list of World Heritage Sites. The proposal was successful and in 2001 the Derwent Valley Mills were designated a World Heritage Site. Its status as a World Heritage Site is intended to ensure its protection; all such sites are considered to be of &quot;outstanding value to humanity&quot;. The site was listed under the second and fourth Heritage Site selection criteria. The Derwent Valley Mills pioneered worker&#x27;s housing as well as much technology developed by Richard Arkwright, producing an industrial landscape and heralding industrial towns. The Derwent Valley Mills Partnership is responsible, on behalf of the British government, for the management of the site. In June 2009, Bath Street Mill in Derby was damaged by fire. The building was part of the World Heritage Site and dated from the 18th century.

In 2018, the &quot;Cromford Mills Creative Cluster and World Heritage Site Gateway Project&quot; was listed as a finalist for the &quot;Best Major Regeneration of a Historic Building or Place&quot; in the Historic England Angel Awards. In 2019, the Arkwright Society employed 100 persons at the Cromford Mills site; the restoration expenditure by that time was £48 million.

===Museums===
* Richard Arkwright&#x27;s Masson Mill is now a working textile museum with the largest collection of bobbins in the world.
* Leawood Pumphouse is now a working museum which still does the original job of pumping water from the Derwent to Cromford Canal, Open on selected weekends.
* At Belper, while much of the site has been converted to other business uses, the Belper North Mill building houses the Derwent Valley Visitor Centre. This features displays of machinery and other items associated with the history of the Derwent Valley textile industry.
* At the extreme southern end of the site, Lombe&#x27;s Silk Mill now houses the Derby Industrial Museum. This museum closed on 3 April 2011 and was mothballed for over two years.
* In October 2013 a programme started to reinvent the silk mill for the 21st Century, incorporating the principles of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Maths). The museum now opens 4 days a week.
*The Derby Industrial Museum was re-branded as the Museum of Making in November 2021. It houses a series of exhibits about the history of the Derwent Valley Mills and the wider context of manufacturing.

<text>Princeton is a census-designated place (CDP) and unincorporated community in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. The population was 39,208 at the 2020 census, up from 22,038 at the 2010 census.

== History ==

As a small town and depot along the Florida East Coast Railroad in the 1900s, the community was named by Gaston Drake after his alma mater, Princeton University. Many of the town buildings were even painted the school&#x27;s colors: black and orange. Drake operated a saw mill and lumber company in Princeton supplying Miami, the Florida Keys and Cuba until the local timber gave out in 1923.

== Geography ==
Princeton is located southwest of downtown Miami and northeast of Homestead at (25.535634, -80.397485). It is bordered to the north by Goulds and to the southwest by Naranja, both unincorporated.

U.S. Route 1 (Dixie Highway) runs northeast to southwest through Princeton, and the Homestead Extension of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike forms the eastern edge of the community, with access from Exit 9 (Florida State Road 989).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.67%, are water.

== Demographics ==

<text>Richmond Heights is a census-designated place (CDP) in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. The population was 8,944 at the 2020 census.

==History==

At the beginning of World War II, the United States Navy purchased of land in southwestern Dade (now called Miami-Dade) County for the purpose of constructing an airship base. The land was owned by the Richmond Timber Company, a major supplier of Dade County Pine (a denser, harder, sub-species of &quot;Pinus palustris&quot;, or longleaf pine). The base was named Naval Air Station Richmond, after the lumber company, and was home to the 25 ships of ZP-21 (Patrol, Airship Squadron 21 and Airship Wing 2). NAS Richmond was the second largest airship base in the United States, NAS Lakehurst in New Jersey being the largest. NAS Richmond was destroyed by a hurricane and fire in September 1945.

After the end of World War II, Captain Frank C. Martin, a Pan American pilot, purchased farmland adjacent to the base in rural southwest Dade County. With this purchase he created Richmond Heights, as a new community for returning African American veterans.

Of the original he purchased in 1949, the federal government had used to build the headquarters of Naval Air Station Richmond, a blimp base constructed in the early months of World War II Richmond, and was eventually home to 25 K-series blimps, three hangars, and 3,000 men. The hangars were 16 stories tall, built of Douglas fir brought in by train. The blimps protected ship convoys in the Florida Straits, and Richmond was the headquarters for the fight against U-boats operating in the Caribbean.

<text>Richmond West is a census-designated place (CDP) in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. The population was 35,884 at the 2020 census, up from 31,973 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Richmond West has its origins as an early 1900s settlement named Eureka. In 1907, the one-room Eureka Schoolhouse was built at the corner of S.W. 147th Avenue (Naranja Road) and S.W. 184th Street (Eureka Drive). It closed in 1916 when it and six other area one-room schoolhouses were consolidated into the Redland Farm Life School four miles to the south. In 1927, the Seaboard Air Line Railway arrived, building a depot in the settlement, by then known as Richmond. Although the depot has long since been demolished, the railroad line, now owned by Seaboard&#x27;s successor CSX, remains.

The 1945 Homestead hurricane caused an estimated $50,000,000-worth of damage, impacting the area. Nearly half of the financial loss happened at the neighboring Richmond Naval Air Station, where winds ignited a fire at three hangars, destroying 25 blimps, 366 planes and 150 automobiles.

The area remained mostly agricultural until the mid-1980s when several sub-developments and the Dadeland Mobile Home Park were built south of S.W. 152nd Street (Coral Reef Drive). In August 1992, Hurricane Andrew destroyed the mobile home park and devastated the surrounding area. Many of the homes and businesses in the area were completely destroyed. In subsequent years, the area was gradually rebuilt, and development proceeded southward to the community&#x27;s southern border at Eureka Drive.

<text>South Miami is a city in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. The city is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. The population was 12,026 as of the 2020 census.

==History==
South Florida had been roamed by Native Americans (Tequesta, Calusa, and Jaega), probably for centuries, before white pioneers advanced through Little Hunting Ground (later known as Miami&#x27;s Coconut Grove neighborhood) to Big Hunting Ground (now known as the Cutler neighborhood of Palmetto Bay).

Wilson Alexander Larkins (1860–1946) was 36 years old when he, his wife (Katie Estelle Burtashaw) and five children, and their livestock arrived in Fort Dallas (now the Lummus Park Historic District of Miami) in 1896. He purchased property west of Red Road and Sunset Drive, where he built a home and barn. He also built the first general store east of that area in 1898 at what is known today as Cartagena Plaza or Cocoplum Circle (actually in Coral Gables). As the community grew, he established a post office in the community. Larkins became the first postmaster, a role he held for sixteen years; he named the area &quot;Manila&quot;, but the majority of the settlers, who began building homes around his store, preferred the name of &quot;Larkins&quot; in his honor.

A depot was placed along the Florida East Coast Railway in 1904, and in the same year, John Moses Dowling built the first house within what is now South Miami city limits. His son-in-law opened the first store on the west side of the tracks, called the White Palace Grocery.

Other prominent historic families have historic buildings and streets named for them, such as Dorn Avenue (Southwest 59th Avenue) and the Shelley Building, among others. Harold W. Dorn and his brother Robert moved to the area in 1910; their primary interest was growing mango and avocado. Mary E. Dorn was the first president of the Cocoplum Thimble Club, the first Women&#x27;s club in Larkins. In 1925, the Dorn brothers built the Riviera Theatre at 5700 South Dixie Highway; in 1934, Charles T. Fuchs moved his Holsum Bakery from Homestead to South Miami and turned the Riviera Theatre Building into a bakery.

The first African-American to purchase land in the Larkins area was Marshall Williamson, who moved there from Madison, Florida. He built his home at 6500 SW 60th Avenue and allowed it to be used for church services even before the construction was completed. In 1916, he donated land for the St. John&#x27;s AME (African Methodist Episcopal) Church, one of Larkins&#x27; first churches and the first church in the black community; it is located at 6461 SW 59th Place. Later, Williamson also donated land for the J. R. E. Lee School. Because of his generosity, the black neighborhood became known as Madison Square, after Williamson&#x27;s hometown. Williamson died in 1972. Named after him is Marshall Williamson Park, at 6125 SW 68 Street.

In 1926, area residents wanted to incorporate their area, and because of the booming city to the north of them, they chose the name of &quot;Town of South Miami&quot;. The original town boundaries were Red Road on the east, Kendall Drive to the south, Palmetto Road to the west (now Palmetto Expressway), and Bird Road and Miller Drive to the north. The year 1926 also saw the first street lighting and the first incoming class of freshmen at the newly chartered University of Miami campus, which abuts the city of South Miami eastern boundary along Red Road (SW 57th Avenue). Also founded with a university theme that same year was the Cambridge Lawns neighborhood of South Miami, situated just from the university campus. The neighborhood&#x27;s Cambridge Lawns Historic District, some 30 homes in the Tudor Revival and Mediterranean revival style completed in 1928, were granted historic recognition by the City of South Miami in 2005.

Also in 1926, South Miami received extensive damage from the 1926 Miami hurricane. The town&#x27;s leaders asked Congress to &quot;relieve the people of their income tax for the current year,&quot; but federal assistance was not forthcoming. The Florida East Coast Railway station burned down, leaving the town without a station for many years. Residents suffered storm damage again from Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and from Hurricane Bonnie (1998).

On June 25, 1927, W. A. Forster was sworn in as South Miami&#x27;s first mayor.

In 1933, the original six square miles of South Miami were reduced to just over three miles (5 km) due to an effort to reduce municipal responsibilities. The city&#x27;s size was reduced again in 1937, and many of the northern city residents sued to get out of the city. This is why the city of South Miami has the most irregular boundaries of any city in Miami-Dade County today.

Of mid-century South Miami, local historian Donna Shelley writes:

Construction of the current City Hall building was approved by referendum in 1955. Designed by architect Henry George Fink, the governmental seat on Sunset Drive was dedicated in October 1956 by Mayor Paul U. Tevis.

Jack Block was elected mayor of the city in 1968, and was thereafter re-elected every two years until 1984 when, as he told interviewer Gregory W. Bush, &quot;I started to not enjoy it as much.&quot; In that interview, for the University of Miami Oral History Program, he gave snapshots of South Miami history when he told Bush (a history professor at the University of Miami),

In 1990, Catherine (Rutherford) McCann (1933–2009) was elected as South Miami&#x27;s first female Mayor, and was re-elected in 1992. She was responsible for the clean-up of South Miami after Hurricane Andrew; the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; wrote, &quot;She had an encyclopedic knowledge of the South Miami city charter. She pushed for affordable housing and responsible development.&quot;

In 2000, South Miami joined other municipalities in the country in forming city partnerships to help foster cultural and economic development between cities around the world. South Miami is a member of Sister Cities International and formed relationships with the cities of Grand Turk in Turks and Caicos Islands and Basseterre in Saint Kitts and Nevis.

According to reporting by &quot;SOMI&quot; magazine, a local publication, during early October 2018, &quot;[o]n August 21, 2018, in the City of South Miami Commission Chambers the forging of a &#x27;Sister-City&#x27; between the City of South Miami, Florida, and the &quot;Municipio de Medellin&quot;, Colombia, was formalized.&quot;

==Economy==
The South Miami business community is served by Chamber South with offices at 6410 S.W. 80 Street in South Miami, and by the Red Sunset Merchants Association of South Miami.

The Consulate-General of Mexico in Miami is located on the ground floor of the office building located at 5975 Southwest 72nd Street (Sunset Drive) in South Miami. Tech/automotive ecommerce startup company PartsHawk occupies the top floor of the same building.

The nine-acre property site of the Holsum Bakery was for decades afterward known as the Bakery Center to the local residents, and various businesses came and went on that site long after Holsum was gone.

A large complex called, in fact, the Bakery Center, a $35 million project, was proposed in 1982. It was built and opened in 1985, but it was not popular and was demolished in 1996. South Miami residents complained about the architecture, which seemed closed from pedestrians, elitist, and far too tall for a town that liked small, homey buildings and mom-and-pop shops. (Historian Donna Shelley wrote an essay about it entitled &quot;From Baking Dough, To Spending Dough, To Losing Dough&quot;; &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 1996 that &quot;few retail projects failed as badly as the Bakery Center&quot;.) Perhaps the one admired feature was on the outside: an enormous mural by Richard Haas. The investors were never able to find enough small businesses to rent all available spaces in the monolithic building. The consistently successful business, an IMAX theater, was undervalued and closed.

In the 1990s, a large shopping mall called The Shops at Sunset Place was built on the site a retail/entertainment center with a wide, welcoming entrance. The mall had many anchor stores, a mega-plex movie site with 24 movie theaters, and restaurants but several of these places have closed. Food is available from restaurants (such as sidewalk crêpe makers), and it is a popular teenage hangout.

The mall has its detractors. Gabriel Lopez-Bernal, an urban planner praised by the &quot;Miami New Times&quot; for his blogging on &quot;civic discourse&quot;, wrote: &quot;Unlike its predecessor, Sunset Place was designed to be an open-aired Mediterranean community, incorporating former mall aspects like big boxed anchor tenants with street-level restaurants, faux cityscapes, and even a few residential units. The center was originally envisioned to be an entertainment center, but the quick failure of some of the theme restaurants and IMAX Theater, quickly changed intended target use. Since its inception, the mall has struggled to maintain a strong and lasting business base.&quot;

In 2015, The Shops at Sunset Place was acquired for $110.2 million by the joint venture of Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE: FRT), Coconut Grove-based Grass River Property, and Miami Beach-based Comras Co. The mall is, thus, under new management and has been seeking to redevelop the site with plans for a new hotel and other improvements.

<text>Sunny Isles Beach (SIB or more commonly Sunny Isles, and officially the City of Sunny Isles Beach) is a city located on a barrier island in northeast Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. The city is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida, and is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east and the Intracoastal Waterway on the west. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 22,342.

Sunny Isles Beach is an area of cultural diversity with stores lining Collins Avenue, the main thoroughfare through the city. It is renowned for having the 14th tallest skyline in the United States, and according to the 2020 U.S. Census it was the mostly densely populated incorporated place in the United States outside of the New York City metropolitan area.

Developers like Michael Dezer have invested heavily in construction of high-rise hotels and condominiums while licensing the Donald Trump name for some of the buildings for promotional purposes. Sunny Isles Beach has a central location, minutes from Bal Harbour to the south, and Aventura to the north and west.

Sunny Isles Beach was the 2008 site of MTV&#x27;s annual Spring Break celebration, with headquarters at the local Newport Beachside Resort.

==History==

In 1920, Harvey Baker Graves, a private investor, purchased a tract of land for development as a tourist resort. He named it &quot;Sunny Isles, the America Riviera&quot;.

When the Haulover bridge was completed in 1925, the area became accessible from Miami Beach, attracting developers who widened streams, dug canals and inlets and created islands and peninsulas for building waterfront properties on Biscayne Bay.

Sunny Isles Beach was known as North Miami Beach until 1931, then known as Sunny Isles until 1997.

In 1936, Milwaukee malt magnate Kurtis Froedtert bought Sunny Isles. The Sunny Isles Pier was built and soon became a popular destination. Sunny Isles developed slowly until the 1950s when the first single-family homes were built in the Golden Shores area. During the 1950s and 1960s more than 30 motels sprang up along Collins Avenue including the Ocean Palm, the first two-story motel in the U.S. Designed by Norman Giller in 1948 it was developed and owned by the Gingold family for the next 45 years and provided the springboard for Sunny Isles economic development. Tourists came from all over to vacation in themed motels of exotic design along &quot;Motel Row&quot;. One motel, The Fountainhead, was named by its owner Norman Giller after the novel by Ayn Rand. As of 2013, the Ocean Palm Motel is closed.

In 1982 the half-mile-long Sunny Isles Pier was designated a historic site. In the early-mid 1980s, it went through restoration and re-opened to the public in 1986. The pier was damaged severely in October 2005 by Hurricane Wilma. After eight years, it was remodeled and reopened as Newport Fishing Pier on June 15, 2013.

In 1997, the citizens of the area voted to incorporate as a municipality. Sunny Isles was renamed Sunny Isles Beach. Sunny Isles Beach began major redevelopment during the real estate boom of the early 2000s with mostly high-rise condominiums and some hotels under construction along the beach side of Collins Avenue (A1A) replacing most of the historic one- and two-story motels along Motel Row. In 2011, construction began on two more high-rises, Regalia, located on the northern border of the city along A1A, and The Mansions at Acqualina, located adjacent to the Acqualina Resort &amp; Spa on the Beach.

==Geography==

<text>Sweetwater is a city in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. The city is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population was 19,363, up from 13,499 in 2010. 

==Geography==
Sweetwater is located west of downtown Miami at (25.765977, –80.373624). It is bordered to the north and northeast by the city of Doral, to the southeast by Fontainebleau, to the south by Westchester, and to the west by Tamiami. The Ronald Reagan Turnpike forms the western edge of the city, and the Dolphin East-West Expressway crosses the center. U.S. Route 41 (Southwest 8th Street) follows the city&#x27;s southern border.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Sweetwater has a total area of , of which are land and , or 9.58%, are water. The city tripled in size in 2010 upon the annexation of additional areas, including where Dolphin Mall is located. The annexed area is roughly bounded by Northwest Seventh and 25th streets, 107th Avenue and Florida&#x27;s Turnpike extension. The city on December 1, 2021, received approval from the county commission to annex 2 square miles of unincorporated land, bounded by NW 25th Street to the north, NW 12th Street to the south, Florida&#x27;s Turnpike extension to the east and NW 137th Avenue to the west. It doubled the size of Sweetwater, and the area includes the headquarters of the Telemundo television network, as well as many companies like Topgolf, Amazon, Goya, Home Depot, and City Furniture.

==History==
The history of Sweetwater began during the Florida land boom of the 1920s when the Miami-Pittsburgh Land Company purchased land and laid out the original plat of &quot;Sweetwater Groves&quot;. However, the 1926 Miami Hurricane and subsequent South Florida real estate &quot;bust&quot; put an abrupt end to the development venture.

In 1938, Clyde Andrews acquired most of the &quot;Sweetwater Groves&quot; tract and began to market lots. Among his buyers was a troupe of Russian dwarves seeking a place to retire after a career with the circus. They built several mini-scaled homes suited to their needs. For years, Sweetwater was known as the &quot;midget&quot; community.

In 1941, Sweetwater held a successful election for incorporation. The new town&#x27;s first mayor was Joe Sanderlin, the dwarfs’ guardian and manager. By 1959, Sweetwater had attracted 500 residents and contained a town hall, church, grocery store, service station and 183 homes. It also had a two-man police force and a volunteer fire department. In 1970, Sweetwater was still a relatively small community of about 3,000 residents.

During the 1970s, several events dramatically changed the &quot;sleepy little country town&quot; of Sweetwater forever. These events included the establishment of Florida International University to the south of the city, the construction of the two major expressways to the north and west, and the discovery of Sweetwater by Dade County&#x27;s Hispanic community. The growth and development which was precipitated by these occurrences caused Sweetwater to more than double in population and lead all other Dade cities in growth during the 1970s.

In March 1996, Sweetwater made national news as 69 animals were found dead on two properties in the city. Dade County police and the local zoologist blamed a large dog, while some residents blamed the killings on the chupacabra.

In the 2010s, there are only a few vacant lots left to develop. By 2010, the city&#x27;s population had burgeoned to 13,499 persons, of which 95.5% were of Hispanic origin. The city now has a full-service police department, four parks, an elementary school, a county fire station, 4,353 residential housing units, 14 shopping centers, over 600 businesses, several churches and a bank. Sweetwater is also located near Miami International Mall. After a December 2010 vote, Dolphin Mall is now part of the city.

At the time, very little was located around FIU, and the campus was referred to as University Park.

==History==
The name &quot;Islamorada&quot; (), spelled &quot;isla morada&quot; in Spanish, &quot;purple island&quot;, came from early Spanish explorers in the area.

Islamorada was the location of one of the stations of the Overseas Railroad.

Islamorada was hit almost directly by the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935, causing 423 deaths. A memorial, including the ashes of over 300 victims, exists today at Overseas Highway mile marker 82.

Hall of Fame baseball player Ted Williams began visiting Islamorada in 1943 and for the next 45 years was the island&#x27;s most well-known resident. After his retirement from baseball he became the national spokesman for Sears sporting goods, and became renowned for his abilities as a fisherman. Over the decades, he hosted numerous celebrities at his Islamorada house and took them on local fishing trips.

The village was incorporated on December 31, 1997. Prior to this date, &quot;Islamorada&quot; referred to the evolving community island of Upper Matecumbe Key.

Islamorada Public Library-Helen Wadley Branch is part of the Monroe County Public Library. The first public library in the Keys opened in Key West in 1853, and today there are five locations throughout the Keys that serve over 350,000 young people and adults. The current Islamorada library is housed in a Works Progress Administration (WPA) building, built originally as the Matecumbe School in the late 1930s. It was designed to be hurricane proof. As the number of children attending the school increased, they were moved to a larger school and the building housed several other entities before opening as the Islamorada Branch of the Monroe County Library in 1966. It was not considered a &quot;usual&quot; library as it offered couches, tea and coffee. Today the building is a little bigger than it was when it first opened its doors in 1938. Two additions were made, one in 1983 and another in 1999. (Bertelli, 2015) The library was rededicated in 1983, in honor of Mrs. Helen Wadley, a true friend of the library. This branch is home to six WPA commissioned bas relief sculptures by Joan van Breeman.

==The Blue Hole==
The Blue Hole is an abandoned rock quarry that was used for nearby road fills and Henry Flagler&#x27;s Overseas Railroad. The water it contains is mostly fresh and is used by various wildlife in the area, such as birds, snakes, alligators and invasive green iguanas. It is part of the National Key Deer Refuge.

==Business and commerce==
The primary grocery store is located in a shopping center just north of US 1. This shopping center contains several restaurants, an outlet store, electronics store, the visitor center for the National Key Deer Refuge, and a branch of the Monroe County Library (with WiFi internet access). Pharmacies are located along US 1, as well as a shoe store, a tropical decor store, and a bait and tackle shop. A small hardware store in the same area sells typical paint, hardware, tools, other goods needed to build/repair items around the home, and a limited selection of parts for boat repair.

Several bars and restaurants are along the US 1 corridor. The nearest city of note is Marathon about 23 miles (37 km) &quot;north&quot; on US 1. Key West, a major shopping and cultural hub for the area, is about 30 miles (48 km) &quot;south&quot; on US 1.

Accommodation is limited, though RV/camping and a small number of motel-style units are available on the far southeast side of the island.

==Key deer==

The island of Big Pine Key is home to the National Key Deer Refuge. The majority of the Key deer population are found on this island.

The Key deer is the smallest subspecies of white-tailed deer. The largest bucks are less than a yard high at the shoulders and weigh approximately 80 pounds. The does are 24 to 28 inches at the shoulders and weigh approximately 65 pounds. They have many habitats in the Florida Keys including pine rocklands, hardwood hammocks, mangroves, and freshwater wetlands. Key deer are only found from Big Pine Key to Sugarloaf Key.

As Key deer are endangered, many precautions have been taken to preserve as much Key deer habitat as possible:
*Signs are prominently placed along US 1 to inform drivers that they are entering Key deer habitat, and warning them that feeding Key deer is prohibited.
*About 2 miles of US 1 on the eastern end of Big Pine Key are elevated and fenced off to allow Key deer to pass under the road.
*The stretch of US 1 in Big Pine Key has a night-time speed limit of 35 miles per hour (as Key deer are most active at night) and the speed limits (45 MPH in the day) are &quot;strictly enforced&quot; according to signage.

<text>Cudjoe Key is a census-designated place and unincorporated community in Monroe County, Florida, United States, on an island of the same name in the lower Florida Keys. As of the 2020 census, the CDP had a population of 2,019, up from 1,763 in 2010.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The island was called &quot;Littleton Island&quot; in 1772. The name changed to Cudjoe&#x27;s by 1849, later shortened to Cudjoe. It may have been named for the Joewood or Cudjoe wood tree (&quot;Jacquinia keyensis&quot;) which grows on the island. John Viele notes that &quot;Cudjoe&quot; is an Akan name, and may have been the name of an escaped slave who lived on the island early in the 19th century.

===20th century===
The United States Army activated Cudjoe Key Air Force Station in 1959 to track missiles traveling through the Eglin Gulf Test Range. The Air Force took over operations the following year, and it subsequently became a detached installation of Homestead Joint Air Reserve Base.

===21st century===
The air force station flies a white radar aerostat, known locally as &quot;Fat Albert&quot;, which is used for drug interdiction missions by the Drug Enforcement Administration. On April 20, 2007, a Cessna 182 crashed after its left wing struck the tether anchoring &quot;Fat Albert&quot;. The aerostat is marked on air navigation charts inside a restricted area that contains the warning, &quot;Caution: Unmarked balloon on cable to 14,000 [feet].&quot;

On September 10, 2017, Cudjoe Key suffered a direct hit from Hurricane Irma which made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane.

Ownership of Newkirk&#x27;s Indies Inn changed in 1983 when the Pompano Beach Barrington Group purchased the holdings and made extensive changes. The nine-hole par 3 course designed by Robert Trent Jones was removed to make room for a resort expansion approved in 1986. The resort name was changed to Hawk&#x27;s Cay Resort and Marina. Additional swimming pools and recreational facilities were added in the late 1990s.

The Singh Company of Key West, well known for the Truman Annex, entered the Upper Keys in the middle 1990s and began Hawk&#x27;s Cay Village. This added several hundred Caribbean-style cottages all with water views, porches and the traditional white picket fence.

There are presently 381 homes, multiple recreational facilities and complete convention facilities.

<text>Key Colony Beach is a municipality in the middle of the Florida Keys, Monroe County, Florida, United States. The population was 790 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Before the early 1950s, Shelter Key (on which most of the City of Key Colony Beach is located) was a low-lying island. Then, Phil Sadowski began dredging around the island, adding to its size and increasing its height to above mean sea level, and later built developments on the island.

Around 1956–1957, residents of nearby Marathon began discussing incorporating the entire area. Sadowski was not keen on having his development swallowed up into Marathon, so he began the process of incorporating the island into its own city. The Florida Legislature passed legislation in June 1957 allowing incorporation, which local residents passed unanimously in September, thus creating today&#x27;s Key Colony Beach.

Incorporation became a blessing in 1960, when much of the city was destroyed by Hurricane Donna. As a separately incorporated city, Key Colony Beach received its own federal grant to rebuild; nearby Marathon (not yet incorporated) had to settle for a portion of the grant given to Monroe County. However, the storm (and then the takeover of Cuba by Fidel Castro) depressed real estate prices, and it took several years to for prices to stabilize.

==Geography==
Key Colony Beach is located at (24.724515, –81.017928). Most of the city is located on an island formerly known as Shelter Key; a small part of the city is on Fat Deer Key, where the Sadowski Causeway, the only road entering the city, connects to U.S. 1 (the Overseas Highway) and the city of Marathon, on the east side of the city. Marathon lies to the northwest, north, and northeast of Key Colony Beach, while the Atlantic Ocean is to the south.

Along the Sadowski Causeway are some charter fishing boats and a dockside restaurant called Sparky&#x27;s Landing. At the south end of the causeway, West Ocean Drive branches off first to the right and East Ocean Drive soon after branches to the left. On West Ocean Drive is the police station, along with the post office and town hall. In the same vicinity is a small park with a fountain and a gazebo. The entire ocean-facing side of West Ocean Drive is lined by various condominium complexes, while the side facing Marathon houses the Key Colony Inn and a par-3 golf course. Starting at the far end of East Ocean Drive, streets are numbered one to fifteen east to west, and run from south to north toward Shelter Bay. The most notable buildings along East Ocean Drive are the Key Colony Beach Motel and the Key Colony Beach Club. At the tip of West Ocean Drive is Sunset Park, the place closest to where a woman was fatally struck by a spotted eagle ray. Many news reports were recorded from this park overlooking the shallows where the Vaca Cut meets the Atlantic Ocean.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , or 32.20%, are water.

==Climate==
The City of Key Colony Beach has a tropical climate, similar to the climate found in much of the Caribbean. It is part of the only region in the 48 contiguous states that falls under that category. More specifically, it generally has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Aw&quot;), bordering a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Am&quot;).

<text>Key Largo is an unincorporated area and census-designated place in Monroe County, Florida, United States, located on the island of Key Largo in the upper Florida Keys. The population was 12,447 at the 2020 census, up from 10,433 in 2010. The name comes from the Spanish &quot;Cayo Largo&quot;, or &quot;long key&quot;. It is both the first island and town of the Florida Keys to be reached from the Overseas Highway to Key West. It was also the location of one of the stations of the Overseas Railroad.

==Geography==
Key Largo is located at (25.106637, -80.429917). It shares the island of Key Largo with Tavernier to the southwest and North Key Largo to the northeast. U.S. Route 1, the Overseas Highway, runs the length of the community, leading north to Miami and southwest to Key West.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 20.96%, are water.
Key Largo is the location of the first undersea park in the United States, established in 1963, and called the John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park (located at Mile Marker 102). The park is primarily offshore and stretches into the Atlantic Ocean and is long. Adjacent to this is the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary covering 178 square nautical miles. Both areas were designed to protect marine life, including the extensive coral reefs in the area.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification, Key Largo has a tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot;).

==Education==

The Monroe County School District operates the Key Largo School.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami formerly operated the Saint Justin Martyr, Academy of Marine Science (PK-9) school in Key Largo.

==In popular culture==
The 1948 film &quot;Key Largo&quot;, starring Edward G. Robinson, Lauren Bacall, and Humphrey Bogart, was set there. The 1981 hit single &quot;Key Largo&quot; by Bertie Higgins was inspired by the film, not the namesake town. Conversely, the 1984 single &quot;Smooth Operator&quot; by Sade references the town, rather than the film. The song &quot;Kokomo&quot; by the Beach Boys also references Key Largo.

<doc id="109495" wikidata="Q485186" url="?curid=109495" title="Key West">
<text>Key West is an island in the Straits of Florida, within the U.S. state of Florida. Together with all or parts of the separate islands of Dredgers Key, Fleming Key, Sunset Key, and the northern part of Stock Island, it constitutes the City of Key West.

The island of Key West is about long and wide, with a total land area of . Within Florida, it is southwest of Miami by air, about by road. Key West is approximately north of Cuba at their closest points, and north-northeast of Havana.

The city of Key West is the county seat of Monroe County, which includes a majority of the Florida Keys and part of the Everglades. The total land area of the city is . The population within the city limits was 26,444 at the 2020 census. The official city motto is &quot;One Human Family&quot;.

Key West is the southernmost city in the contiguous United States and the westernmost island connected by highway in the Florida Keys. Duval Street, its main street, is in length in its 14-block-long crossing from the Gulf of Mexico to the Straits of Florida and the Atlantic Ocean. Key West is the southern terminus of U.S. Route 1the longest north–south road in the United States, as well as State Road A1A, the East Coast Greenway and, before 1935, the Florida East Coast Railway. Key West is a port of call for passenger cruise ships. The Key West International Airport provides airline service. Naval Air Station Key West is an important year-round training site for naval aviation due to the tropical weather, which is also the reason Key West was chosen as the site of President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s Winter White House. The central business district is located along Duval Street and includes much of the northwestern corner of the island.

==History==
===Precolonial and colonial times===
At various times before the 19th century, people who were related or subject to the Calusa and the Tequesta inhabited Key West. The last Native American residents of Key West were Calusa refugees who were taken to Cuba when Florida was transferred from Spain to Great Britain in 1763.

&quot;Cayo Hueso&quot; () is the original Spanish name for the island of Key West. It literally means &quot;bone cay&quot;, &quot;cay&quot; referring to a low island or reef. It is said that the island was littered with the remains (bones) of prior native inhabitants, who used the isle as a communal graveyard. This island was the westernmost Key with a reliable supply of water.

Between 1763, when Great Britain took control of Florida from Spain, and 1821, when the United States took possession of Florida from Spain, there were few or no permanent inhabitants anywhere in the Florida Keys. Cubans and Bahamians regularly visited the Keys, the Cubans primarily to fish, while the Bahamians fished, caught turtles, cut hardwood timber, and salvaged wrecks. Smugglers and privateers also used the Keys for concealment. In 1766 the British governor of East Florida recommended that a post be set up on Key West to improve control of the area, but nothing came of it. During both the British and Spanish periods no nation exercised &quot;de facto&quot; control. The Bahamians apparently set up camps in the Keys that were occupied for months at a time, and there were rumors of permanent settlements in the Keys by 1806 or 1807, but the locations are not known. Fishermen from New England started visiting the Keys after the end of the War of 1812, and may have briefly settled on Key Vaca in 1818.

===Ownership claims===
In 1815, the Spanish governor of Cuba in Havana deeded the island of Key West to Juan Pablo Salas, an officer of the Royal Spanish Navy Artillery posted in Saint Augustine, Florida. After Florida was transferred to the United States in 1821, Salas was so eager to sell the island that he sold it twice – first for a sloop valued at $575 to a General John Geddes, a former governor of South Carolina, and then to a U.S. businessman John W. Simonton, during a meeting in a Havana café on January 19, 1822, for the equivalent of $2,000 in pesos in 1821. Geddes tried in vain to secure his rights to the property before Simonton who, with the aid of some influential friends in Washington, was able to gain clear title to the island. Simonton had wide-ranging business interests in Mobile, Alabama. He bought the island because a friend, John Whitehead, had drawn his attention to the opportunities presented by the island&#x27;s strategic location. John Whitehead had been stranded in Key West after a shipwreck in 1819 and he had been impressed by the potential offered by the deep harbor of the island. The island was indeed considered the &quot;Gibraltar of the West&quot; because of its strategic location on the –wide deep shipping lane, the Straits of Florida, between the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico.

On March 25, 1822, Lt. Commander Matthew C. Perry sailed the schooner to Key West and planted the U.S. flag, claiming the Keys as United States property. No protests were made over the American claim on Key West, so the Florida Keys became the &quot;de facto&quot; property of the United States.

After claiming the Florida Keys for the United States, Perry renamed &quot;Cayo Hueso&quot; (Key West) to Thompson&#x27;s Island for Secretary of the Navy Smith Thompson, and the harbor Port Rodgers in honor of War of 1812 hero and President of the Navy Supervisors Board John Rodgers. In 1823, Commodore David Porter of the United States Navy West Indies Anti-Pirate Squadron took charge of Key West, which he ruled as military dictator under martial law. The United States Navy gave Porter the mission of countering piracy and the slave trade in the Key West area.

===First developers===
Soon after his purchase, John Simonton subdivided the island into plots and sold three undivided quarters of each plot to:
* John Mountain and U.S. Consul John Warner, who quickly resold their quarter to Pardon C. Greene, who took up residence on the island. Greene is the only one of the four &quot;founding fathers&quot; to establish himself permanently on the island, where he became quite prominent as head of P.C. Greene and Company. He was a member of the city council and also served briefly as mayor. He died in 1838 at the age of 57.
* John Whitehead, his friend who had advised him to buy Key West. John Whitehead lived in Key West for only eight years. He became a partner in the firm of P.C. Greene and Company from 1824 to 1827. A lifelong bachelor, he left the island for good in 1832. He came back only once, during the Civil War in 1861, and died the next year.
* John Fleeming (nowadays spelled Fleming). John W.C. Fleeming was English-born and was active in mercantile business in Mobile, Alabama, where he befriended John Simonton. Fleeming spent only a few months in Key West in 1822 and left for Massachusetts, where he married. He returned to Key West in 1832 with the intention of developing salt manufacturing on the island but died the same year at the age of 51.

Simonton spent the winter in Key West and the summer in Washington, where he lobbied hard for the development of the island and to establish a naval base on the island, both to take advantage of the island&#x27;s strategic location and to bring law and order to the town. He died in 1854.

The names of the four &quot;founding fathers&quot; of modern Key West were given to main arteries of the island when it was first platted in 1829 by William Adee Whitehead, John Whitehead&#x27;s younger brother. That first plat and the names used remained mostly intact and are still in use today. Duval Street, the island&#x27;s main street, is named after Florida&#x27;s first territorial governor, William Pope Duval, who served between 1822 and 1834 as the longest-serving governor in Florida&#x27;s U.S. history.

William Whitehead became chief editorial writer for the &quot;Enquirer&quot;, a local newspaper, in 1834. He preserved copies of his newspaper as well as copies from the &quot;Key West Gazette&quot;, its predecessor. He later sent those copies to the Monroe County clerk for preservation, which gives us a view of life in Key West in the early days (1820–1840).

In the 1830s, Key West was the richest city per capita in the United States.

In 1846, the city suffered severely from the 1846 Havana hurricane.

In 1852, the first Catholic Church, St. Mary&#x27;s Star-Of-The-Sea, was built. The year 1864 became a landmark for the church in South Florida when five Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary arrived from Montreal, Canada, and established the first Catholic school in South Florida. At the time it was called Convent of Mary Immaculate. The school is still operating today and is now known as Mary Immaculate Star of the Sea School.

===American Civil War and late 19th century===

During the American Civil War, while Florida seceded and joined the Confederate States of America, Key West remained in U.S. Union hands because of the naval base. Most locals were sympathetic to the Confederacy, however, and many flew Confederate flags over their homes. However, Key West was also home to a large free black population. This population grew during the war as more enslaved black people fled from their enslavers and came under the relative safety of the Union garrison there. Fort Zachary Taylor, constructed from 1845 to 1866, was an important Key West outpost during the Civil War. Construction began in 1861 on two other forts, East and West Martello Towers, which served as side armories and batteries for the larger fort. When completed, they were connected to Fort Taylor by railroad tracks for movement of munitions. Early in 1864, 900 men from the 2nd United States Colored Troops (USCT) arrived in Key West as replacements for the 47th Pennsylvania Volunteers. Many of these men would see action in southern Florida and the 2nd USCT would become &quot;one of the most active&quot; black regiments in Florida. Fort Jefferson, located about from Key West on Garden Key in the Dry Tortugas, served after the Civil War as the prison for Samuel A. Mudd, convicted of conspiracy for setting the broken leg of John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of President Abraham Lincoln.

In the 19th century, major industries included wrecking, fishing, turtling, and salt manufacturing. From 1830 to 1861, Key West was a major center of U.S. salt production, harvesting the commodity from the sea (via receding tidal pools) rather than from salt mines. After the outbreak of the Civil War, Union troops shut down the salt industry after Confederate sympathizers smuggled the product into the South. Salt production resumed at the end of the war, but the industry was destroyed by an 1876 hurricane and never recovered, in part because of new salt mines on the mainland.

During the Ten Years&#x27; War (an unsuccessful Cuban war for independence in the 1860s and 1870s), many Cubans sought refuge in Key West. Several cigar factories relocated to the city from Cuba, and Key West quickly became a major producer of cigars. The Great Fire of Key West, on April 1, 1886, started at a coffee shop next to the San Carlos Institute and spread out of control, destroyed 18 cigar factories and 614 houses and government warehouses. Some factory owners chose not to rebuild and instead moved their operations to the new community of Ybor City in Tampa, leading to a slow decline in the cigar industry in Key West. Still, Key West remained the largest and wealthiest city in Florida at the end of the 1880s.

 sailed from Key West on her fateful visit to Havana, where she blew up and sank in Havana Harbor, igniting the Spanish–American War. Crewmen from the ship are buried in Key West, and the Navy investigation into the blast occurred at the Key West Customs House.

===20th century===

In October 1909, Key West was devastated by the 1909 Florida Keys hurricane. Further damage was suffered the following year in the 1910 Cuba hurricane.

Key West was relatively isolated until 1912, when it was connected to the Florida mainland via the Overseas Railway extension of Henry M. Flagler&#x27;s Florida East Coast Railway (FEC). Flagler created a landfill at Trumbo Point for his railyards.

The 1919 Florida Keys hurricane caused catastrophic damage to the area.

On December 25, 1921, Manuel Cabeza was lynched by members of the Ku Klux Klan for living with a black woman.

Pan American Airlines was founded in Key West, originally to fly visitors to Havana, in 1926. The airline contracted with the United States Postal Service in 1927 to deliver mail to and from Cuba and the United States. The mail route was known as the &quot;Key West, Florida – Havana Mail Route&quot;.

The Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 destroyed much of the Overseas Railway and killed hundreds of residents, including around 400 World War I veterans who were living in camps and working on federal road and mosquito-control projects in the Middle Keys. The FEC could not afford to restore the railroad.

The U.S. government then rebuilt the rail route as an automobile highway, completed in 1938, built atop many of the footings of the railroad. It became an extension of U.S. Route 1. The portion of U.S. 1 through the Keys is called the Overseas Highway. Franklin Roosevelt toured the road in 1939.

During World War II, more than 14,000 ships came through the island&#x27;s harbor. The population, because of an influx of soldiers, sailors, laborers, and tourists, sometimes doubled or even tripled at times during the war.

Starting in 1946, US President Harry S. Truman established a working vacation home in Key West, the Harry S. Truman Little White House, where he would spend 175 days of his presidency.

In 1948, Key West suffered damage from two hurricanes within as many months, from the September 1948 Florida hurricane then the 1948 Miami hurricane.

Prior to the Cuban revolution of 1959, there were regular ferry and airplane services between Key West and Havana.

John F. Kennedy was to use &quot;90 miles from Cuba&quot; extensively in his speeches against Fidel Castro. Kennedy himself visited Key West a month after the resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis.
In 1982, the city of Key West briefly asserted independence as the Conch Republic as a protest over a United States Border Patrol blockade. This blockade was set up on US 1, where the northern end of the Overseas Highway meets the mainland at Florida City. A traffic jam of ensued while the Border Patrol stopped every car leaving the Keys, supposedly searching for illegal immigrants attempting to enter the mainland United States. This paralyzed the Florida Keys, which rely heavily on the tourism industry. Flags, T-shirts and other merchandise representing the Conch Republic are still popular souvenirs for visitors to Key West, and the Conch Republic Independence Celebration—including parades and parties—is celebrated annually, on April 23.

In 1998, Hurricane Georges damaged the city.

In 2017, Hurricane Irma caused substantial damage with wind and flooding, killing three people.

==Geography==
Key West is an island located at in the Straits of Florida. The island is about long and wide, with a total land area of . The average elevation above sea level is about and the maximum elevation is about , within a area known as Solares Hill.

The city of Key West is the southernmost city in the contiguous United States, and the island is the westernmost island connected by highway in the Florida Keys. The city boundaries include the island of Key West and several nearby islands, as well as the section of Stock Island north of U.S. Route 1, on the adjacent key to the east. The total land area of the city is , with an additional of surrounding water within the city limits. Sigsbee Parkoriginally known as Dredgers Keyand Fleming Key, both located to the north, and Sunset Key located to the west are all included in the city boundaries. Both Fleming Key and Sigsbee Park are part of Naval Air Station Key West and are inaccessible to the general public.

In the late 1950s, many of the large salt ponds on the eastern side of the island were filled in. The new section on the eastern side is called New Town, which contains shopping centers, retail malls, residential areas, schools, ball parks, and Key West International Airport.

Key West and most of the rest of the Florida Keys are on the dividing line between the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. The two bodies have different currents, with the calmer and warmer Gulf of Mexico being characterized by great clumps of seagrass. The shallow passage known as Hawk Channel lies directly south of the island and is conducive to the exchange of Gulf waters to the Atlantic via tidal currents. The area where the two bodies merge between Key West and Cuba is called the Straits of Florida. The warmest ocean waters anywhere on the United States mainland are found in the Florida Keys in winter, with sea surface temperatures averaging in the range in December through February.

Duval Street is the main street in Key West and is in length in its 14-block-long crossing from the Gulf of Mexico to the Straits of Florida and the Atlantic Ocean.

Key West is closer to Havana (about by air or sea) than it is to Miami ( by air or by road). Key West is the usual endpoint for marathon swims from Cuba, including Diana Nyad&#x27;s 2013 swim and Susie Maroney&#x27;s 1997 swim from within a shark cage.

===Notable places===
====Old Town====

The earliest Key West neighborhoods, on the western part of the island, are broadly known as Old Town. The Key West Historic District includes the major tourist destinations of the island, including Mallory Square, Duval Street, the Truman Annex, and Fort Zachary Taylor. Old Town is where the classic bungalows and guest mansions are found. Bahama Village, southwest of Whitehead Street, features houses, churches, and sites related to its Afro-Bahamian history. The Meadows, lying northeast of the White Street Gallery District, is exclusively residential.

Many of the structures in Old Town date from 1886 to 1912. The basic features that distinguish the local architecture include wood-frame construction of one- to two-and-a-half-story structures set on foundation piers about above the ground. Exterior characteristics of the buildings are peaked metal roofs, horizontal wood siding, gingerbread trim, pastel shades of paint, side-hinged louvered shutters, covered porches (or balconies, galleries, or verandas) along the fronts of the structures, and wood lattice screens covering the area elevated by the piers.

Some antebellum structures survive, including the Oldest (or Cussans-Watlington) House (1829–1836) and the John Huling Geiger House (1846–1849), now preserved as the Audubon House and Tropical Gardens. Fortifications such as Fort Zachary Taylor, the East Martello Tower, and the West Martello Tower, helped ensure that Key West would remain in Union control throughout the Civil War. Another landmark built by the federal government is the Key West Lighthouse, now a museum.

Two of the most notable buildings in Old Town, occupied by prominent 20th-century residents, are the Ernest Hemingway House, where the writer lived from 1931 to 1939, and the Harry S. Truman Little White House, where the president spent 175 days of his time in office. Additionally, the residences of some historical Key West families are recognized on the National Register of Historic Places as important landmarks of history and culture, including the Porter House on Caroline Street and the Gato House on Virginia Street.

Several historical residences of the Curry family remain extant, including the Benjamin Curry House, built by the brother of Florida&#x27;s first millionaire, William Curry, as well as the Southernmost House and the Fogarty Mansion, built by the children of William Curry—his daughter Florida and son Charles, respectively.
In addition to architecture, Old Town includes the Key West Cemetery, founded in 1847, containing above-ground tombs, notable epitaphs, and a plot where some of the dead from the 1898 explosion of are buried.

The Casa Marina area takes its name from the Casa Marina Hotel, opened in 1921, the neighborhood&#x27;s most conspicuous landmark. The Reynolds Street Pier, Higgs Beach, the West Martello Tower, the White Street Pier, and Rest Beach line the waterfront.

====Southernmost point in the United States====

One of the most popular attractions on the island is a concrete replica of a buoy at the corner of South and Whitehead Streets that claims to be the southernmost point in the contiguous United States. The point was originally marked with a basic sign. The city of Key West erected the current monument in 1983. The monument was repainted after damage by Hurricane Irma in 2017, and is the most often photographed tourist site in the Florida Keys.
Although the monument is labeled &quot;Southernmost point continental U.S.A.&quot;, the actual southernmost point of Key West is Whitehead Spit, which is on the Truman Annex property just west of the buoy. The spit has no marker since it is on U.S. Navy land that cannot be entered by civilian tourists. The private property directly to the east of the buoy, and the beach areas of Truman Annex and Fort Zachary Taylor Historic State Park, also lie farther south than the buoy. The southernmost point of the contiguous United States is Ballast Key, a privately owned island just south and west of Key West. The southernmost location that the public can visit is the beach at Fort Zachary Taylor park.

The monument states &quot;90 Miles to Cuba&quot;, although Key West and Cuba are actually about apart at their closest points. Note that the distance from the monument to Havana is, however, about .

====Key West Library====
The first public library was officially established in 1853, which was housed in the then-Masonic Temple on Simonston Street, near where the federal courthouse is today. At the time, the first library president was James Lock, with the librarian being William Delaney. At the time, the library collected held 1,200 volumes for residents to access.

In 1919, a hurricane destroyed the library. Key West residents moved the library to various locations across the island. The county took over and finally found a permanent location. The library&#x27;s new location was found in 1959. It was built on Fleming Street, where it is still found today.

=====&quot;Spoonbill&quot;=====
In 1961, the Monroe County Library System sponsored a bookmobile, &quot;Spoonbill&quot;, to service the entire Keys. By 1962, &quot;Spoonbill&quot; was making stops in ten different Keys, over , from Key Largo in the North to Key West in the South. Mrs. Barbara Banning was the driver-librarian, driving over in the first year and a half, circulating more than 28,000 titles.

On Mondays, the &quot;Spoonbill&quot; would be loaded with books in Key West and Banning and her assistant, or volunteer, would drive up to Key Largo, Tavernier, and Islamorada, stopping for an hour in each location; Wednesdays the &quot;Spoonbill&quot; made stops in Marathon, Big Pine, Little Torch, and Summerland.

On Thursdays, the &quot;Spoonbill&quot; would only travel from home base, making stops in Bay Point, Big Coppitt, and Gulf Rest. At Bay Point there was a popular children&#x27;s story hour, servicing roughly three hundred school-age children and led by former kindergarten teacher, Mrs. Ernest Hense.

=====Collection=====
The Key West Library has a collection of 70,000 items, including a letter from singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett. Dated from October 22, 1984, the letter expresses gratitude for the library in giving inspiration for the songs he would eventually write, and for the air conditioning. As of 2022, the Key West Library is a part of the Monroe County Public Library System.

===Notable residences===
====Little White House====
Several U.S. presidents have visited Key West with the first being Ulysses S. Grant in 1880, followed by Grover Cleveland in 1889, and William Howard Taft in 1912. Taft was the first president to use the first officer&#x27;s quarters that would later be known as the Little White House. Franklin D. Roosevelt visited the Florida Keys many times, beginning in 1917.

Harry S. Truman visited Key West for a total of 175 days on 11 visits during his presidency and visited five times after he left office. His first visit was in 1946. The Little White House and Truman Annex take their names from his frequent and well-documented visits. The residence is also known as the Winter White House as Truman stayed there mostly in the winter months, and used it for official business such as the Truman Doctrine.

Dwight D. Eisenhower stayed at the Little White House following a heart attack in 1955. John F. Kennedy visited Key West in March 1961, and in November 1962, a month after the resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Jimmy Carter visited the Little White House twice with his family after he had left office, in 1996 and 2007.

====Ernest Hemingway house====
Legend has it that Ernest Hemingway wrote part of &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; while living above the showroom of a Key West Ford dealership at 314 Simonton Street while awaiting delivery of a Ford Model A roadster purchased by the uncle of his wife Pauline in 1928.

Hardware store owner Charles Thompson introduced him to deep-sea fishing. Among the group who went fishing was Joe Russell (also known as Sloppy Joe). Some scholars believe Russell was the model for Freddy in &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot;. The group had nicknames for each other, and Hemingway wound up with &quot;Papa&quot;.

Pauline&#x27;s rich uncle Gus Pfeiffer bought the 907 Whitehead Street house in 1931 as a wedding present. The Hemingways installed a swimming pool for $20,000 in 1937–38 (equivalent to about $ in ). The unexpectedly high cost prompted Hemingway to put a penny in the wet cement of the patio, saying, &quot;Here, take the last penny I&#x27;ve got!&quot; The penny is at the north end of the pool.

During his stay he wrote or worked on &quot;Death in the Afternoon&quot;, &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, &quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot;, and &quot;The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber&quot;. He used Depression-era Key West as one of the locations in &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot;—his only novel with scenes that occur in the United States.
The six- or seven-toed polydactyl cats descended from Hemingway&#x27;s original pet &quot;Snowball&quot; still live on the grounds and are cared for at the Hemingway House, despite complaints by the U.S. Department of Agriculture that they are not kept free from visitor contact. The Key West City Commission has exempted the house from a law prohibiting more than four domestic animals per household.

Pauline and Hemingway divorced in 1939; Hemingway only occasionally visited when returning from Havana until his suicide in 1961.

====Tennessee Williams house====
Tennessee Williams first became a regular visitor to Key West in 1941 and is said to have written the first draft of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; while staying in 1947 at the La Concha Hotel. He bought a permanent house in 1949 and listed Key West as his primary residence until his death in 1983. In contrast to Hemingway&#x27;s grand house in Old Town, the Williams home at 1431 Duncan Street in the &quot;unfashionable&quot; New Town neighborhood is a very modest bungalow. The house is privately owned and not open to the public. The Academy Award-winning film version of his play &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; was shot on the island in 1956. The Tennessee Williams Theatre is located on the campus of Florida Keys Community College on Stock Island.

Though Hemingway and Williams lived in Key West at the same time, they reportedly met only once—at Hemingway&#x27;s home in Cuba, Finca Vigía.

===Port of Key West===
The first cruise ship to adopt the port was the &quot;Sunward&quot; in 1969. It docked at Pier B, which was owned at that time by the U.S. Navy.

In 1984, the city opened a cruise terminal at Mallory Square. The decision was met with opponents who claimed that it would disrupt the tradition of watching the sunset at Mallory Square.

Today, the Port of Key West includes Key West Bight, Garrison Bight at City Marina, as well as three docks that could be used by cruise ships.

==Climate==

Key West has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen &quot;Aw&quot;, similar to many of the Caribbean islands). Like most localities near the edge of the tropics, Key West has a relatively large range in monthly mean temperatures between the coldest month (January) and the hottest month (July), with the annual range of monthly mean temperatures around . The lowest recorded temperature in Key West is on January 12, 1886, and January 13, 1981. Key West is located in USDA plant hardiness zone 12a, with an annual mean minimum temperature of .

Prevailing easterly trade winds and sea breezes suppress the usual summertime heating (while increasing the winter rainfall), with temperatures rarely reaching . There are 56 days per year with or greater highs, with the average window for such readings June 8 through September 24, shorter than almost the entire southeastern U.S. Low temperatures often remain above , however. The all-time record high temperature is on July 19, 1880, and August 29, 1956.

===Wet and dry seasons===

Like most tropical climates, Key West has a two-season wet and dry climate. The period from November through April is normally sunny and fairly dry, with only 25 percent of the annual rainfall occurring. May through October is normally the wet season. During the wet season some rain falls on most days, often as brief, but heavy tropical downpours, followed by intense sun. Early morning is the favored time for these showers, which is different from mainland Florida, where showers and thunderstorms usually occur in the afternoon. 

Easterly (tropical) waves during this season occasionally bring excessive rainfall, while infrequent hurricanes may be accompanied by unusually heavy amounts. On average, rainfall markedly peaks between August and October; the single wettest month in Key West is September, when the threat from tropical weather systems (hurricanes, tropical storms and tropical depressions) is greatest. Key West is the driest city in Florida, averaging just over of rain per year. This is driven primarily by Key West&#x27;s relative dryness in May, June and July. In mainland Florida peninsular areas like Orlando, Tampa/St. Petersburg and Fort Myers, June and July average monthly rainfalls typically reach , while Key West has only half such amounts over the same period.

===Hurricanes===

Key West, like the rest of the Florida Keys, is vulnerable to hurricanes. The most recent hurricane to impact Key West was Hurricane Irma, which made landfall in the Keys in the morning of September 10, 2017 as a Category 4 storm.

Some locals maintain that Hurricane Wilma on October 24, 2005, was the worst storm in memory. The entire island was told to evacuate and business owners were forced to shut their doors. After the hurricane had passed, the resulting storm surge sent of water inland completely inundating a large portion of the lower Keys. Low-lying areas of Key West and the lower Keys, including major tourist destinations, were under as much as of water. Sixty percent of the homes in Key West were flooded. The higher parts of Old Town, such as the Solares Hill and cemetery areas, did not flood, because of their higher elevations of . The surge destroyed tens of thousands of cars throughout the lower Keys, and many houses were flooded with of sea water. A local newspaper referred to Key West and the lower Keys as a &quot;car graveyard&quot;. The peak of the storm surge occurred when the eye of Wilma had already passed over the Naples area, and the sustained winds during the surge were less than . The storm destroyed the piers at the clothing-optional Atlantic Shores Motel and breached the shark tank at the Key West Aquarium, freeing its sharks. Damage postponed the island&#x27;s famous Halloween Fantasy Fest until the following December. MTV&#x27;s &quot;The Real World: Key West&quot; was filming during the hurricane and deals with the storm.

In September 2005, NOAA opened its National Weather Service forecast office building on White Street. The building is designed to withstand a Category 5 hurricane and its storm surge.

The most intense previous hurricane was Hurricane Georges, a Category 2, in September 1998. The storm damaged many of the houseboats along &quot;Houseboat Row&quot; on South Roosevelt Boulevard near Cow Key channel on the east side of the island.

=== &quot;Conchs&quot; ===

Many of the early residents of Key West were immigrants from the Bahamas, known as Conchs (pronounced &quot;conks&quot;&#x27;), who arrived in increasing numbers after 1830. Many were sons and daughters of Loyalists who fled to the nearest Crown soil during the American Revolution. In the 20th century many residents of Key West started referring to themselves as &quot;Conchs&quot;, and the term is now generally applied to all residents of Key West. Some residents use the term &quot;Conch&quot; (or, alternatively, &quot;Saltwater Conch&quot;) to refer to a person born in Key West, while the term &quot;Freshwater Conch&quot; refers to a resident not born in Key West but who has lived in Key West for seven years or more. The true original meaning of &quot;Conch&quot; applies only to someone with European ancestry who immigrated from the Bahamas, however. It is said that when a baby was born, the family would put a conch shell on a pole in front of their home.

Many of the black Bahamian immigrants who arrived later lived in Bahama Village, an area of Old Town next to the Truman Annex.

===Cuban presence===

Key West is closer to Havana () than it is to Miami (). In 1890, Key West had a population of nearly 18,800 and was the biggest and richest city in Florida. Half the residents were said to be of Cuban origin, and Key West regularly had Cuban mayors, including the son of Carlos Manuel de Céspedes, father of the Cuban Republic, who was elected mayor in 1876. Cubans were actively involved in reportedly 200 factories in town, producing 100 million cigars annually. José Martí made several visits to seek recruits for Cuban independence starting in 1891 and founded the Cuban Revolutionary Party during his visits to Key West.

Key West received a large number of refugees during the Mariel Boatlift. Refugees continue to come ashore and, on at least one occasion, most notably in April 2003, flew hijacked Cuban Airlines planes into the city&#x27;s airport.

==Government and politics==
Key West is governed via a mayor-council system. The city council is known as the city commission. It consists of six members each elected from individual districts. The mayor is elected in a citywide vote.

===Mayors===

Mayors of Key West have reflected the city&#x27;s cultural and ethnic heritage. It has had mayors of Cuban ancestry and others that were openly gay. One mayor is famous for having water-skied to Cuba.

==Military presence==
NAS Key West, Boca Chica and the Truman Annex have been the home of U.S. ships, submarines, &quot;Pegasus&quot;-class hydrofoils, Fighter Training Squadrons like the current VFC-111 &quot;Sundowners&quot;, and Light Photographic Reconnaissance Squadrons like the former VFP-62 &quot;Fighting Photos&quot; during the Cuban Missile Crisis. NAS Key West is still a training facility for US Naval Aviation personnel.

Key West has had a military presence since 1823, shortly after its purchase by Simonton in 1822. John W. Simonton lobbied the U.S. government to establish a naval base on Key West, both to take advantage of its strategic location and to bring law and order to the Key West town. On March 25, 1822, naval officer Matthew C. Perry sailed the schooner Shark to Key West and planted the U.S. flag claiming the Keys as United States property. In 1823, a naval base was established to protect shipping merchants in the lower keys from pirates that would eventually evolve through the Civil War, the Spanish American War, two world wars, and the Cold War as Naval Station Key West, eventually home to the Fleet Sonar School, Marine Barracks Key West, Submarine Squadron 4, Submarine Squadron 12, Destroyer Squadron 12, and various diesel-powered submarines and surface ships. NAVSTA Key West was closed in 1974 as part of post-Vietnam War force reductions across the Department of Defense. A portion of the original NAVSTA Key West still remains under Navy control as Naval Air Station Key West-Truman Annex while a portion containing Fort Zachary Taylor was conveyed to the State of Florida as Fort Zachary Taylor State Park. The Truman Little White House has also been preserved as a museum based on its history as a part-time residence of President Harry S. Truman during his presidency. The remainder of the original base was conveyed to civilian control for redevelopment and now comprises The Key West Amphitheater, Truman Waterfront Park, residential redevelopment consisting of both homes and condominiums, and a portion of Mallory Square.

Key West was always an important military post, since it sits at the northern edge of the deepwater channel connecting the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico (the southern edge away is Cuba) via the Florida Straits. Because of this, Key West since the 1820s had been dubbed the &quot;Gibraltar of the West&quot;. Fort Taylor was initially built on the island. The Navy added a small base from which sailed to its demise in Havana at the beginning of the Spanish–American War which later evolved into NAVSTA Key West.

===Naval Air Station Key West===

At the beginning of World War II the Navy increased its presence from , including all of Boca Chica Key&#x27;s and the construction of Fleming Key from landfill. The Navy built the first water pipeline extending the length of the Keys, bringing fresh water from the mainland to supply its bases. At its peak 15,000 military personnel and 3,400 civilians were at the base. Included in the base are:
* Naval Air Station Key West – This is the main facility on Boca Chica. The air station&#x27;s primary purpose is readiness training for carrier-based strike fighter, electronic attack and carrier airborne early warning squadrons of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet and U.S. Pacific Fleet, primarily via the Fleet Fighter Aircrew Readiness Program (FFARP), honing the skills of Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers in air combat training prior to overseas deployment. An additional squadron permanently based at NAS Key West, Fighter Composite Squadron 111 (VFC-111), is composed of both active duty and Navy Reserve pilots who fly F-5 Tiger II aircraft as simulated enemy aggressors in Dissimilar Air Combat Training (DACT) for Fleet aircrews, primarily using the offshore Key West Tactical Air Crew Training System (TACTS) Range. Permanent party officer and enlisted personnel assigned to NAS Key West are primarily housed at the Navy&#x27;s Sigsbee Park housing area eight miles to the west or in private housing on the local economy. In 2006 there were 1,650 active duty personnel; 2,507 family members; 35 Reserve members; and 1,312 civilians listed at the base. In the 1990s the Navy worked out an agreement with the National Park Service to eliminate sonic booms in the vicinity of Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas. Many of the training missions are directed at the &quot;Marquesas &quot;Patricia&quot; Target&quot; due west of the base. The target is a grounded ship hulk in length that is visible only at low tide. Bombs are not actually dropped on the target.
* Truman Annex – The area next to Fort Taylor became a submarine pen and was used for the Fleet Sonar School. President Harry S. Truman was to make the commandant&#x27;s house his winter White House. The Fort Taylor Annex was later renamed the Truman Annex. This portion has largely been decommissioned, with Fort Zachary Taylor conveyed to the State of Florida as a state park and the remainder turned over to private developers and the city of Key West. There are still a few military and U.S. government offices and facilities there, including the new NOAA Hurricane Forecasting Center and the military headquarters for Joint Interagency Task Force South, an element of U.S. Southern Command. The Navy still owns its piers.
* Trumbo Point Annex – The docking area on what had been the railroad yard for Flagler&#x27;s Overseas Railroad is now used by the Coast Guard as Coast Guard Sector Key West and Coast Guard Station Key West, to include being the homeport for several Coast Guard cutters. It is also home to the Bachelor Officers Quarters (BOQ) for NAS Key West and contains additional married family military housing.

<text>Marathon is a city in the middle of the Florida Keys, in Monroe County, Florida, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 9,689, up from 8,297 in 2010.

==History==

Though the area has been settled for some time, Marathon is a relatively new city, incorporated in 1999.

The name Marathon dates back to the origin of the Florida East Coast Railroad. The name came from the railroad workers who were working night and day to complete the railway; due to the unrelenting pace and struggle to complete the project, workers complained that &quot;this is getting to be a real marathon&quot;, and the word was later used to name the local railroad station.

The Keys historian Dan Gallager in his book &quot;Florida&#x27;s Great Ocean Railway&quot; credits New York playwright Witter Bynner for naming Marathon. According to Gallager, J.R. Parrott, then Florida East Coast Railway&#x27;s President and General Manager, invited Brynner to the Keys to &quot;plot stations for the railroad&quot;. When asked to generate a name for the station at Key Vaca, Brynner proposed &quot;Marathon&quot;, inspired by the following passage from Byron: &quot;The mountains look on Marathon—and Marathon looks on the sea.&quot;

Marathon experienced significant damage from the September 10, 2017, U.S. landfall of Hurricane Irma. One of the earliest casualties of the storm was a man who died in a school shelter. Marathon was one of the earliest spots in the Keys to receive transport of needed supplies to deal with the aftermath of Irma. The Air National Guard landed two C-130 transport planes every two hours beginning on the morning of September 11.

==Economy==

Marathon is a major sport fishing destination, with several charter fishing boats departing from local marinas every morning to both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Bountiful reefs around Marathon make it a popular diving, snorkeling, spearfishing, and lobster tickling area. One of the last untouched tropical hardwood hammocks in the Keys is found at Crane Point Museum, just a few miles west of Florida Keys Marathon Airport. The vicinity of the airport is one of the most reliable sites in the United States to see the hard-to-find Antillean nighthawk. As in the rest of the Keys in summer, gray kingbirds are often seen on telephone wires along US 1 and black-whiskered vireos incessantly sing in the hammocks. Marathon also hosts burrowing owls.

The Fisherman&#x27;s Hospital is in the west end of the city. It is one of just three hospitals in the Florida Keys. Marathon is home to another &quot;hospital&quot;, The Turtle Hospital, one of a handful of facilities in the United States that rescue, rehabilitate, and release injured sea turtles.

Marathon derives much of its livelihood from the ocean and seafood is a staple at most restaurants.

Marathon has the tallest building in the Keys, Bonefish Tower at on Coco Plum, as well as Sombrero Country Club, the Keys&#x27; only country club. It was damaged by several recent hurricanes. With the redevelopment of the Faro Blanco property with a new Hyatt Place Hotel, restaurant and marina, and the redevelopment of the former Ramada Inn hotel into a new Hampton Inn and Suites hotel, Marathon is experiencing a social and economic rebirth.

<text>Fernandina Beach is a city in northeastern Florida and the county seat of Nassau County, Florida, United States. It is the northernmost city on Florida&#x27;s Atlantic coast, situated on Amelia Island, and is one of the municipalities comprising Greater Jacksonville (formally the Jacksonville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area). The area was first inhabited by the Timucuan Indian people. Known as the &quot;Isle of 8 Flags&quot;, Amelia Island has had the flags of the following nations flown over it: France, Spain, Great Britain, Spain (again), the Republic of East Florida (1812), the Republic of the Floridas (1817), Mexico, the Confederate States of America, and the United States.

The French, English, and Spanish all maintained a presence on Amelia Island at various times during the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, but the Spanish established Fernandina. The town of Fernandina, which was about a mile from the present city, was named in honor of King Ferdinand VII of Spain by the governor of the Spanish province of East Florida, Enrique White. Fernandina has the distinction of being the last Spanish city platted in the Western Hemisphere, in 1811.

According to the 2020 census, the city population was 13,052, up from 11,487 at the 2010 census. It is the seat of Nassau County. It is also the largest incorporated city in the county, since Yulee is an unincorporated town.

==History==

Prior to the arrival of Europeans on what is now Amelia Island, Native Americans occupied the site of the original town of Fernandina. Native American bands associated with the Timucuan mound-building culture had settled on the island about 1000 CE, calling it Napoyca. They remained on the island until the early 18th century, when European settlement began.

===Old Town Fernandina===
On January 1, 1811, Enrique White, governor of Spain&#x27;s East Florida province, named the town of Fernandina, about a mile from the present city, in honor of King Ferdinand VII. On May 10 of that year, Fernandina became the last town platted under the Laws of the Indies in the Western hemisphere. The town was intended as a bulwark against U.S. territorial expansion. In the following years, it was captured and recaptured by a succession of renegades and privateers.

====Republic of East Florida====
At the beginning of the Patriot War, with the approval of President James Madison and Georgia Governor George Mathews on March 13, 1812, insurgents known as the &quot;Patriots of Amelia Island&quot; seized the island. After raising a Patriot flag, they replaced it with the United States flag. American gunboats under the command of Commodore Hugh Campbell maintained control of the island. On May 15, 1812, the British brig. &quot;Sappho&quot; fired on Gunboat no. 168, which had fired on the loyalist merchant vessel &quot;Fernando&quot; to prevent her leaving. Outgunned, the American gunboat withdrew, which enabled several vessels to escape from the port. President Madison eventually denounced the filibustering of George Mathews, however, on the grounds that Mathews had violated his instructions.

====Mexico====
Spanish pressure forced the American evacuation from the island in 1813. Spanish forces erected Fort San Carlos on the island in 1816. However, A Scottish soldier and adventurer named Gregor MacGregor with 55 musketeers seized Fort San Carlos in 1817, claiming the island on behalf of &quot;the brethren of Mexico, Buenos Ayres, New Grenada and Venezuela&quot;, and raised the Green Cross of Florida flag over the Spanish Fort San Carlos.
MacGregor claimed to be Brigadier General of the armies of the United Provinces of New Grenada and Venezuela (where he had successfully fought and led troops), and General-in-Chief of the armies for the two Floridas, commissioned by the Supreme Director of Mexico.

Spanish soldiers forced MacGregor&#x27;s withdrawal, but their attempt to regain complete control was foiled by American irregulars organized by Ruggles Hubbard and former Pennsylvania congressman Jared Irwin. Hubbard and Irwin later joined forces with the French-born pirate Louis Aury, who laid claim to the island on behalf of the Republic of Mexico. U.S. Navy forces drove Aury from the island, and President James Monroe vowed to hold Amelia Island &quot;in trust for Spain.&quot;

===Modern Fernandina===
In 1847 construction of Fort Clinch began in nearby present-day Fernandina. The Third System fort was named after General Duncan Lamont Clinch who fought in the War of 1812 and the Seminole Wars. Senator David Levy Yulee, founder of the Florida Railroad, wanted the eastern terminus of his railroad line to end in Amelia Island. The Old Town Fernandina was too cut off by the marshes to be used as a terminal. Yulee wanted to end the railroad on the banks of the Amelia River one mile to the south. The leaders of Fernandina did not want a new community to grow and prosper to surpass their town. The leaders of Fernandina decided to move the town up to the railroad where the present-day Fernandina Beach stands. Yulee began construction of the railroad in 1855 and was completed in 1861.

====Civil War====

On January 8, 1861, two days before Florida&#x27;s secession, Confederate sympathizers (the Third Regiment of Florida Volunteers) took control of Fort Clinch, already abandoned by the Federal workers who had been enlarging the structure. The Confederates erected batteries on the northern end of Amelia Island but lacked the resources to fortify Fort Clinch. Robert E. Lee, who was commanding coastal defenses in the Deep South, ordered cannons and troops withdrawn in early 1862.

Lee&#x27;s orders to withdraw the cannons and troops were too late. Union forces, consisting of 28 gunboats commanded by Commodore Samuel Dupont, occupied the island on March 3, 1862, and raised the American flag. In January 1863, the first all-black regiment of former slaves recruited to fight for the Union was read Lincoln&#x27;s Emancipation Proclamation at Fernandina. Three weeks later they set sail up the St. Marys River to engage the Confederate forces. The Union used the fort as a base for its operations in the area for the remainder of the war.

====Later 19th century====
In 1891, Harmon Murray, who had been the leader of a criminal gang operating out of Gainesville, arrived in Fernandina, where his sister lived. Murray was soon committing burglaries and robberies in Fernandina and elsewhere on Amelia Island. Law officers chased a black suspect several times, who shot at them on one occasion. Murray taunted the police with a letter in early May, to the effect that he would not be taken alive, and would take the Nassau County sheriff and Fernandina police chief with him. Acting on a tip, on May 16 police surrounded the house Murray was staying in. Murray heard the officers getting into position, and shot and killed deputy sheriff Joseph W. Robinson. In the ensuing gun battle Murray wounded Fernandina Police Chief James Higgenbotham. Although grazed on the wrist and scalp, Murray was able to escape. Despite the intensive manhunt for him, Murray was able to slip off of Amelia Island to the mainland. The City of Fernandina offered a reward for the capture of Murray, &quot;dead or alive&quot;.

<text>Crestview is the largest city and county seat of Okaloosa County, Florida, United States. The population was 27,134 at the 2020 census, up from 20,978 at the 2010 census. With an elevation of above sea level, it is one of the highest points in the state.

Crestview is a principal city of the Crestview–Fort Walton Beach–Destin, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Crestview was largely an outgrowth of the arrival of railroad service to the western Panhandle of Florida.

The Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad Company, chartered in 1881, opened its line between Pensacola and Chattahoochee in January 1883. Two express passenger trains, the &quot;Atlantic Express&quot; and the &quot;Gulf Express&quot;, as well as a local accommodation train that made stops along the route, were in daily operation. The express trains took about six hours for the journey, while the local train took thirteen hours. When the railroad company was unable to cover its debt obligations, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad covered the shortfalls until 1885 and then foreclosed, absorbing the route into its system as the L&amp;N&#x27;s Pensacola and Atlantic Division.

In 1894, sawmill operator W. B. Wright opened the Yellow River Railroad between Crestview and Florala, Alabama via Auburn, Campton, and Laurel Hill. The L&amp;N provided the line with freight cars and purchased the operation in 1906, renaming it the Yellow River Branch. However, without significant shippers to sustain the line, it was eventually used for freight car storage in the early 1980s and was abandoned in May 1985, with 25.3 miles of track removed. Parts of the former right of way were paved as local streets.

Crestview was officially incorporated as a city in 1916. The 1920 US Census recorded the population of Crestview at 500 residents.

On July 23, 1920, Crestview hosted Okaloosa County&#x27;s first public hanging. Robert Blackwell was convicted of murdering Nancy and Bud Davis in 1917 and was sentenced to death. A week before his execution, Blackwell confessed, and his confession was printed in local newspapers on the day of his hanging. The second and final public execution in Okaloosa County took place on September 23, 1921, when Putnam Ponsell and Jacob Benjamin Marin were hanged for the murder of John F. Tuggle. This double hanging was the last public execution in Florida.

In 1937, Smith-Johnson Company, Inc. opened a garment factory in Crestview, which utilized 250 machines and employed around 300 workers.

A modern bus terminal served by Greyhound Lines&#x27; Jacksonville-Los Angeles route, with connections north to Atlanta, Memphis, and New York, opened on the corner of Ferdon and Pearl Streets on May 9, 1941. The terminal featured waiting rooms, a lounge, smoking rooms, a restaurant, and a loading concourse, and was segregated according to the norms of the time.

As nearby Eglin Field expanded into a major testing base, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad laid a long sidetrack in Crestview in the spring of 1941 to handle the influx of oil tank cars required for a vast paving project on ten new airfields. A fleet of trucks operated around the clock to offload an estimated 180 carloads of petroleum products.

A recreation center for enlisted men at Eglin Field was opened in Crestview on June 21, 1941, through the efforts of the Community Recreation Council, the Works Progress Administration, and the Okaloosa Progressive Association.

In January 1943, a misunderstanding involving Crestview’s constabulary led to the town being briefly off-limits to military personnel from Eglin Field. The &quot;Pensacola News Journal&quot; reported on January 31, 1943, that the restriction had been lifted after a conference between town officials and Eglin authorities. The incident was triggered when the town marshal attempted to arrest a soldier for reckless driving and an Eglin officer for interference. The overzealous marshal was suspended following the event.

On July 31, 1949, the L&amp;N inaugurated the &quot;Gulf Wind&quot; streamliner through Crestview, connecting New Orleans and Jacksonville in partnership with the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, replacing the heavyweight &quot;New Orleans-Florida Limited&quot;. This service was discontinued on April 30, 1971, when Amtrak took over most U.S. passenger rail services.

In the 1960s, Crestview was home to the studio of the Apache Records label.

As part of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round, Crestview experienced significant population growth when the U.S. Army&#x27;s 7th Special Forces Group relocated from Fort Bragg, North Carolina to a newly built facility on the northern end of the Eglin Air Force Base reservation, about six miles south of the city.

In 2007, longtime mayor George Whitehurst resigned, leading to the election of David Cadle, a retired director of the Crestview High School band, The Big Red Machine. Cadle was succeeded in 2019 by JB Whitten, a retired U.S. Air Force member, high school teacher, and Crestview city council member.

<doc id="109508" wikidata="Q2156427" url="?curid=109508" title="Destin, Florida">
<text>Destin is a city located in Okaloosa County, Florida, United States. It is a principal city of the Crestview–Fort Walton Beach–Destin, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 13,931 at the 2020 census, up from 12,305 at the 2010 census.

Located on Florida&#x27;s Emerald Coast, Destin is known for its white beaches and emerald green waters. Originating as a small fishing village, it is now a popular tourist destination. According to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, over 80 percent of the Emerald Coast&#x27;s 4.5 million visitors each year visit Destin. The city styles itself &quot;The World&#x27;s Luckiest Fishing Village&quot; and claims to have the largest fishing vessel fleet in the state of Florida.

The city is located on a peninsula separating the Gulf of Mexico from Choctawhatchee Bay. The peninsula was originally a barrier island. Hurricanes and sea level changes gradually connected it to the mainland. In the 1940s, it technically became an island again with the completion of the Choctawhatchee-West Bay Canal.

==History==

Destin is named after Leonard Destin, a New London, Connecticut fishing captain who settled in the area between 1845 and 1850. He built a New England colonial home at the location of the Moreno Point military reservation. Captain Destin and his descendants fished the area for decades.

Condominiums were first built in Destin during the 1970s, although Destin was not incorporated as a municipality until 1984. The city has experienced rapid growth since the 1980s.

==Geography==
The city is located on a peninsula separating the Gulf of Mexico from Choctawhatchee Bay. The peninsula was originally an island; hurricanes and sea level changes gradually connected the island to the mainland.

Destin is near several other cities in the region. The city of Fort Walton Beach is located to the west at the inlet of Santa Rosa Sound into Choctawhatchee Bay. North of Destin, across the bay is Niceville, with the Mid-Bay Bridge linking the two by road. U.S. Route 98 is the main route through the city, running from west to east. U.S. Route 98 leads east 56 mi (90 km) to Panama City and west 48 mi (77 km) to Pensacola.

At the western tip of the peninsula is East Pass (also known as Destin Pass), separating it from Santa Rosa Island to the west. East Pass is the only outlet of Choctawhatchee Bay into the Gulf of Mexico, Many sources claim that the current pass was dug by hand with an inrush of water widening it within hours. The early pass appears (at the East end of Destin Harbor) in early maps and surveys from Spanish, French, and English surveyors, such as Thomas Jefferys&#x27;s 1775 map &quot;The Coast of West Florida and Louisiana&quot;. Frequent dredging is required to keep East Pass navigable.

&quot;Crab Island,&quot; was actually two islands made from sand that the Army Corps of Engineers dredged up from the East Pass. These islands were large enough to inhabit sea grass, small shrubs and nesting seabirds. It has been reduced to a significant sandbar, which appears only when the tide is out. It has become a popular anchorage in the area. The entrance to Destin Harbor, a lagoon between the beaches and the main body of the western portion of the peninsula, is located just north of the East Pass jetty. The lagoon is formed by a sand spit named Holiday Isle; many condominiums have been built along the harbor since the 1970s. Norriego Point protects the harbor and was doubled in size in order to protect against coastal erosion.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (7.95%) is water.

===Climate===

===Environmental issues===
A 2013 study identified the city as one of the cities in Florida most at risk of inundation. A 2019 report by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection listed sections of the beach as &quot;critically eroded&quot;.

The city received $11 million from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement. This was used to address coastal erosion on Norriego Point, which protects the important harbor. Otherwise, the city has not developed a plan to address sea level rise and coastal erosion.

Florida&#x27;s Department of Environmental Protection estimates that more than 80 percent of the Emerald Coast&#x27;s 4.5 million yearly visitors travel to the region to visit Destin. Visitors can charter fishing vessels from the harbor, and there are 12 beach access points in the city. Among the access points is Henderson Beach State Recreation Area. A portion of the Gulf Islands National Seashore, the Okaloosa Day Use Area, is just across East Pass on Santa Rosa Island.

The sand on Destin&#x27;s beaches is some of the whitest in the world. The sand comes from the Appalachian Mountains, and is made of finely ground quartz crystal giving the appearance of sugar. Residue flows down the Apalachicola River and is deposited into the Gulf of Mexico. Because of the currents the sand drifts west along the Gulf Coast and settles from east of Panama City to the Alabama coast.

Several events also take place throughout the year as well. For the month of October, the annual Destin Fishing Rodeo draws anglers to Destin each year since 1948. Also in the month of October is the Destin Seafood Festival, where fresh seafood and local artists gather for one weekend every October.
In addition to an assortment of hotels and motels, many high-rise condominiums are located in Destin. The first condominiums in Destin were built in the 1970s, and construction continues today. Visitors play a large part in Destin&#x27;s economy – the city&#x27;s population of around 12,000 balloons to 40,000 during the tourist season.

Real estate in Destin, Florida, is comprised in large part by privately owned vacation rentals, consisting of condominiums, beach homes, townhomes, resorts, studios, cottages, and a few bungalows. Most vacation properties are found on the south side of US Hwy 98 near the Gulf, while most locals live on the northern side of US Hwy 98 by the Choctawhatchee Bay.

Destin&#x27;s surroundings include other popular tourist destinations. Sandestin, located to the east in Walton County, is a popular golf and beach resort. Further east along the coast are the master-planned community of Seaside, filming location of the 1998 movie The Truman Show; Grayton Beach, Florida; and Rosemary Beach, Florida. To the west are Navarre Beach and Pensacola Beach, and the Civil War fortification Fort Pickens is located at the western end of Santa Rosa Island. Many celebrities own homes in the area.

<text>Fort Walton Beach, often referred to by the initialism FWB, is a city in southern Okaloosa County, Florida, United States. As of the 2020 U.S. census, the population was 20,922, up from 19,507 in 2010. It is a principal city of the Crestview−Fort Walton Beach−Destin, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Fort Walton Beach is a year-round fishing and beach resort community. Its busiest time of the year is the summer, causing a boost to the local economy because of seasonal human migration.

==History==

Prehistoric settlement of Fort Walton Beach is attributed to the mound building &quot;Fort Walton Culture&quot; that flourished from approximately 1100–1550 CE. It is believed that this culture evolved out of the Weeden Island culture. Fort Walton also appeared to come about due to contact with the major Mississippian centers to the north and west. It was the most complex in the north-west Florida region. The Fort Walton peoples put into practice mound building and intensive agriculture, made pottery in a variety of vessel shapes, and had hierarchical settlement patterns that reflected other Mississippian societies.

The first Europeans to set foot in what is now Okaloosa County and the Fort Walton Beach area were members of Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca&#x27;s party, who traveled by boat from what is now Panama City Beach, Florida in 1528 to Texas, &quot;&quot;Then we set out to sea again, coasting towards the River of Palms. Every day our thirst and hunger increased because our supplies were giving out, as well as the water supply, for the pouches we had made from the legs of our horses soon became rotten and useless. From time to time we would enter some inlet or cove that reached very far inland, but we found them all shallow and dangerous, and so we navigated through them for thirty days, meeting sometimes Indians who fished and were poor and wretched people&quot;.&quot;

The area is described at &quot;40 deaths a day&quot; in a Spanish map dated 1566. In later English and French maps the area was noted as &quot;Baya Santa Rosa&quot; or &quot;Bay St. Rose&quot;. A number of Spanish artifacts, including a portion of brigantine leather armor, are housed in the Indian Temple Mound Museum.

Contrary to popular belief, there is no documentary evidence of pirates using the area as a base of operations. Piracy was rampant in the Gulf of Mexico from pirates working out of Hispaniola, the Caribbean, and the Florida Keys. Notable raids occurred in 1683 and 1687 against the Spanish fort at San Marcos de Apalachee (by French and English buccaneers), a 1712 raid against Port Dauphin (now Alabama) by English pirates from Martinique, and the actions of the late 18th-century adventurer William Augustus Bowles, who was based in Apalachicola. Bowles was never referred to as &quot;Billy Bowlegs&quot; in period documentation; his Creek name was &quot;Estajoca&quot;.

During the era of Spanish and English colonization, the area of what was to become Fort Walton Beach was noted in several journals but no worthwhile presence was established.

Early settlers of Walton County, Florida were the first to establish permanent settlements in what is now Fort Walton Beach (the area was originally named &quot;Anderson&quot;). Two of the first settlers were John Anderson and Andrew A. Alvarez, who received land plots in 1838. The name &quot;Anderson&quot; is noted on maps from 1838 to 1884. It was not until 1911 that the name &quot;Camp Walton&quot; appeared on Florida maps.

In 1861, Camp Walton was a Confederate Army camp, a fortified post, made up of the &quot;Walton Guards&quot;, an independent Company of Florida Volunteer Infantry from Walton County. At this time, Okaloosa County did not yet exist. Walton County received its name from Col. George Walton, who served as secretary of West Florida during Andrew Jackson&#x27;s governorship (1821–1822) and whose father, George Walton Sr., was the 56th signatory of the Declaration of Independence. He is also the namesake of Walton County.

Camp Walton was located between the Indian Temple Mound, now known as the Heritage Park and Cultural Center, and the Santa Rosa Sound, its mission was to protect the &quot;Narrows&quot; from Union ships. Although the &quot;Walton Guards&quot; did not see much action, they did keep busy by digging up prehistoric Indian remains buried in the Indian Temple Mound and displaying them at camp. The post was abandoned in August 1862, and the &quot;Walton Guards&quot; were assigned to reinforce the 1st Florida Infantry Regiment, with duty in the Western Theatre on the Tennessee front.

On April 11, 1879, John Thomas Brooks purchased at a public auction in Milton, Florida, 111 acres in Section 24, Township 2, Range 24 of Santa Rosa County, a portion of the property of Henry Penny whose heirs had failed to pay the taxes on the estate. This parcel on the Santa Rosa Sound became what is now downtown Fort Walton Beach.

The United States Post Office changed the official name on their cancellations from Camp Walton to Fort Walton on 1 March 1932.

The 1940 census counted 90 residents in Fort Walton. Fort Walton was incorporated by a state senate bill effective June 16, 1941.
The community&#x27;s name was officially changed from Fort Walton to Fort Walton Beach on June 15, 1953, by agreement with the state legislature in Tallahassee, and incorporated a portion of Santa Rosa Island formerly known as Tower Beach. Tower Beach, named for a tall observation tower at the site which was later destroyed by a hurricane, had been an amusement area operated from 1928 by the Island Amusement Company by future-Fort Walton Beach mayor Thomas E. Brooks, with a boardwalk, casino, restaurant, dance pavilion, &quot;40 modernly equipped beach cottages&quot;, and concession stands which was largely destroyed by fire on Saturday, March 7, 1942. Wartime supply restrictions prevented a reconstruction. This 875-acre parcel of Santa Rosa Island with three miles of Gulf frontage was conveyed to Okaloosa County on July 8, 1950, in an informal ceremony at the county courthouse in Crestview, Florida. The county paid the federal government $4,000 to complete the transaction, the result of the efforts of Congressman Bob Sikes. The portion of Santa Rosa Island transferred is now known as Okaloosa Island. The remaining Tower Beach summer cottages were removed after the 1955 tourist season as the new Okaloosa Island Authority redeveloped the site with a new hotel and casino. The government was changed to a city manager form.

A special census conducted in 1956 listed 9,456 residents, which grew to 11,249 by 1960.

The last of three county-owned buildings on Okaloosa Island was torn down on May 31, 1995. The buildings had originally housed the Okaloosa Island Authority and more recently the Okaloosa County Council on Aging. The 1.3-acre tract on the north side of Santa Rosa Boulevard was sold.

==Economy==

The economy of Fort Walton Beach is driven by two primary factors: tourism and the military. There are two major Air Force bases which border Fort Walton Beach. Hurlburt Field is home to Headquarters, Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), the 1st Special Operations Wing, and the Joint Special Operations University. Eglin AFB is home to the Air Force Materiel Command&#x27;s Air Force Life Cycle Management Center&#x27;s Armament Directorate and the 96th Test Wing, Air Combat Command&#x27;s 53rd Wing, and Air Education Training Command&#x27;s 33rd Fighter Wing. Eglin is geographically one of the largest Air Force bases at , and thus home to joint exercises, and missile and bomb testing. For example, the &#x27;Massive Ordnance Air Blast&#x27; or &#x27;Mother of All Bombs&#x27; (MOAB) was first tested at Eglin AFB on March 11, 2003.

There is support industry in the area that benefits from the presence of the bases, including military contractors and the service industry.

The tourism industry is seasonal, with summer being the primary season, and a smaller peak season during spring break. The area also boasts a large snowbird population, which includes the Fort Walton Beach Snowbird Club. The Billy Bowlegs Pirate Festival is held annually in June.

<text>Lake Lorraine is a census-designated place (CDP) in Okaloosa County, Florida, United States. The population was 7,142 at the 2020 census, up from 7,010 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Crestview–Fort Walton Beach–Destin, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. It carries a Shalimar postal address and zip code. Lake Lorraine was originally a fresh-water body, but at some point in the 1990s the narrow sandbar that separated it from the Choctawhatchee Bay was breached and the former drainage channel to the tip of Black&#x27;s Point became blocked by silt.

The residential neighborhood originally developed along circumferential Country Club Road, surrounding a golf course, in the 1970s. The recession of 1976 left a number of properties in the interior of the golf course U in an unfinished and abandoned state. These parcels were later reconstructed. Further growth took place in the 1990s and 2000s, when the formerly wooded Black&#x27;s Point area was developed with streets bearing the names of famous golfers. A &quot;backdoor&quot; gate onto Eglin Air Force Base, adjacent to base housing, accessed by Davis Court off of the northeast corner of Country Club Road, was closed amidst tightened base security and concerns about traffic routing through residential neighborhoods in the mid-1970s.

During World War II, adjacent Eglin Field anchored a battleship-size target float in the Choctawhatchee Bay, just south of Black&#x27;s Point, the southernmost point of the Lake Lorraine area, an area designated during the war as Eglin water range 60.
