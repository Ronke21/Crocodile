==History==

In 1920, Joseph Young arrived in South Florida to create his own &quot;Dream City in Florida&quot;. His vision included the beaches of the Atlantic Ocean stretching westward with man-made lakes, infrastructure, roads, and the Intracoastal Waterway. He wanted to include large parks, schools, churches, and golf courses, all industries and activities that were very important to him. After Young spent millions of dollars constructing the city, he was elected its first mayor in 1925. The town quickly became home to northerners known as &quot;snowbirds&quot;, who fled the north during the winter and then escaped the south during the summer. By 1960, Hollywood had more than 2,400 hotel units and 12,170 single-family homes. Young bought up thousands of acres of land around 1920, and named his new town &quot;Hollywood by the Sea&quot; to distinguish it from his other real-estate venture, &quot;Hollywood in the Hills&quot;, in New York.

The Florida guide, published by the Federal Writers&#x27; Project, describes the development of Hollywood, an early example of the planned communities that proliferated in Florida during the real-estate boom of the 1920s:
Prospective purchasers of land were enticed by free hotel accommodation and entertainment, and &quot;were driven about the city-to-be on trails blazed through palmetto thickets; so desolate and forlorn were some stretches that many women became hysterical, it is said, and a few fainted.&quot; Young had a vision of lakes, golf courses, a luxury beach hotel (Hollywood Beach Hotel, now Hollywood Beach Resort), country clubs, and a main street, Hollywood Boulevard. Hollywood was severely damaged by the 1926 Miami hurricane; local newspapers reported that it was second only to Miami in losses from the storm. After Young&#x27;s death in 1934, the city encountered other destructive hurricanes, and the stock market crashed, causing personal financial misfortunes.

Hurricane Irma hit Florida in 2017, causing damage and power outages in Hollywood. 12 residents of the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills died of heat exposure. Four nursing-home staff were charged with negligence and manslaughter. Charges were dropped against the 3 nurses and the nursing home chief was acquitted.

The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity created Rebuild Florida, an initiative to provide aid to citizens affected by Irma. Its initial focus was its Housing Repair Program, which offered assistance in rebuilding families&#x27; homes. The program prioritized low-income vulnerable residents, such as the disabled, the elderly, and families with children under five. The program had varied results across the state, with hundreds of citizens claiming they were left without help.

<text>Lauderdale-by-the-Sea is a town in Broward County, Florida, United States, situated 33 miles north of Miami. The town is part of the South Florida metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the population was 6,198.

==Geography==

Lauderdale-by-the-Sea is located at (26.189561, –80.097756). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (44.2%) is water.

The southern half of Lauderdale-by-the-Sea is situated between Fort Lauderdale and the Village of Sea Ranch Lakes, Florida. The Town&#x27;s northern municipal neighbor is Pompano Beach. The entire town is located on a long, narrow barrier island separated from the mainland by the Intracoastal Waterway (spanned by one drawbridge at Commercial Boulevard), stretching approximately one-half dozen blocks to the Atlantic Ocean. The town is centered on the junction of State Road A1A and Commercial Boulevard. The main industry is tourism; the town has many hotels and motels used by visitors, especially during the winter; many of its older hotels and buildings reflect mid-century modern architecture design [MiMo]. Recognized by the Florida Legislature in 2016 for its near-shore coral reefs and efforts to promote scuba diving, the town is known as Florida&#x27;s Beach Diving Capital. With a coral reef just 100 yards offshore, the town is a popular spot for scuba divers, especially just south of Anglin&#x27;s Pier.

On the ocean at the east end of Commercial Boulevard is Anglin&#x27;s Fishing Pier, named after Lauderdale-by-the-Sea&#x27;s first mayor, Melvin I. Anglin. The town is home to SS &quot;Copenhagen&quot;, a 19th-century British steamship that wrecked in 25 feet of water in May 1900 after striking a coral reef. The historic site is a Florida archaeological underwater preserve and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The town doubled in size in 2001 when it annexed the unincorporated Intracoastal Beach Area to the north. The area included the neighborhoods of Bel Air and Terra Mar Island. Even though the town&#x27;s permanent population is 6,056, it nearly doubles when snowbirds and tourists come here to spend the winter. The Town underwent a major transformation in 2013, when it completed a streetscape project between the Commercial Boulevard Bridge and the ocean. Sidewalks were widened and enhanced with brick pavers as well as landscaping.

Two new public plazas were added in Anglin&#x27;s Square and furnished with colorful &quot;Addy&quot; chairs, boat benches and bike racks shaped like fish. Each of the four business plazas on Commercial were outfitted with coral reef themed artworks (parrotfish, green turtle, eagle ray and sea fan), reflecting the town&#x27;s ties with the ocean. An 18-foot coral reef sculpture also greets visitors as they enter the town over the intracoastal waterway.

<text>Lauderhill is a city in Broward County, Florida, United States. It is a principal city of the Miami metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population was 74,482.

==Etymology==

The development that eventually came to be known as Lauderhill was originally to be named &quot;Sunnydale&quot;, but William Safire, a friend of the developer, Herbert Sadkin, convinced him to change his mind. Safire felt that &quot;Sunnydale&quot; sounded like a neighborhood in Brooklyn. Sadkin said there were no hills in the new town, to which Safire replied, &quot;There are probably no dales in Lauderdale, either!&quot; From that discussion, the name &quot;Lauderhill&quot; was coined. The development eventually grew to become Lauderhill, the city.

==History==
Lauderhill was one of two developments (the other in New York) that began largely as off-the-shelf architectural designs which had been available to the public at Macy&#x27;s department store. The homes, which had been designed by Andrew Geller, had originally been on display at the &quot;Typical American Houses&quot; at the American Exhibition in Moscow. Following a group of approximately 200 of the homes constructed in Montauk, New York in 1963 and 1964, the same developer, Herbert Sadkin of the New York-based All-State Properties reprised his success in New York, building a series of similar homes in Florida, calling the development Lauderhill.

In 2003, the &quot;New York Times&quot; described the Macy&#x27;s homes:

The package deal included a 730- to 1,200-square-foot house on a 75-by-100-foot lot, as well as state-of-the art appliances, furniture, housewares and everything else a family would need for a weekend in the sun, including toothbrushes and toilet paper. The cost was roughly $13,000 to $17,000.

The Inverrary Country Club was built in 1970, and two years later, its East golf course became home to the new Jackie Gleason Inverrary Classic on the PGA Tour, which it hosted through 1983. Gleason himself built his final home on the golf course.

Up until the late 1980s-early 1990s, Lauderhill was mostly a retirement community for Jews and a second home for snowbirds (especially in the Inverrary neighborhood). It is now home to mostly Jamaicans, West Indians, and African Americans, but it still has a sizeable white, Jewish, and Hispanic population in the Northwest section and the Inverrary neighborhood, located north of Oakland Park Boulevard and east of University Drive).

<doc id="109045" wikidata="Q945116" url="?curid=109045" title="Lazy Lake, Florida">
<text>Lazy Lake is a village in Broward County, Florida, United States. The village is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. It has no police department or fire department. The population was 33 at the 2020 census. The village is an enclave in the city of Wilton Manors.

==History==

In 1946, real estate developer and contractor Hal Ratliff began the process of building the community around an old rock quarry (which later was filled with water and became the village&#x27;s artificial lake.) He had the help of architect Clinton Gamble, who designed the original homes, and financier and accountant Charles H. Lindfors, who initially bought the land. Ratliff&#x27;s goal was to build a community that was low-key, with heavy forestry infrastructure, allowing neighbors to keep to themselves and have some anonymity. Lazy Lake received its name when a friend of Hal Ratliff remarked that the lake looked &quot;so lazy and peaceful.&quot;

When nearby Wilton Manors decided to incorporate as a city, it asked Lazy Lake&#x27;s residents whether they wanted to be annexed to Wilton Manors. Lazy Lake&#x27;s residents decided to incorporate themselves as the Village of Lazy Lake instead.

It is the smallest incorporated municipality in Broward County by area. This low population was because the town originally had been composed of single family homes in a small housing development, with a lake named Lazy Lake (its namesake) in the middle of the houses surrounding it. The village started with 13 homes on 13 acres (the maximum allowed by the charter.) The three homes of the three main founders of the village were the first to be built on the property, which was originally platted for a subdivision.

As of 1985, the village&#x27;s annual budget was $7,000.

In 1995, residents agreed to place the entire village up for sale at $15 million, but nobody purchased it. It was on the market for two years, and Sue Carolyn Wise, their broker, went on television news stations and shows like CNN and &quot;A Current Affair&quot; to help promote the sale. People such as O. J. Simpson and a Kuwaiti prince were interested, but ultimately did not buy the village. After the two years of trying to be sold, Lazy Lake came off the market, and the village decided not to have the broker&#x27;s contract renewed.

During 2008, a few residents on the village&#x27;s north side wanted to disincorporate, secede and get annexed and incorporated into the city of Wilton Manors. The reason this small movement failed was because most residents on the south part of the village wanted to remain a village, which was due largely in part because the mayor and most council members at that time lived on the south side.

== Lighthouse Point Library ==

Mission Statement: The Doreen Gauthier Lighthouse Point Library was established (1965) for the purpose of providing community members of all ages with informational, recreational, cultural, and educational enrichment through access to print materials, digital resources, current technologies, services, programs, and a professional library staff.

The first part-time library was a small room in the Beacon Light Shopping Center where the owner gave this area rent free for three months as a gesture of goodwill. The branch began building its collection with duplicate copies of titles from Pompano and Deerfield Beach Libraries, as well as donations from the general public. On March 30, 1965, a glamorous Library Ball was held, with the Lighthouse Point Bank underwriting the cost of the event as well as cosponsoring the affair. The event raised over $5,000. By 1966 the library owned more than 3,000 items, and the tradition of having a Library Ball was continued annually from 1966 to 1971. In January 1968 a lease was signed for a rental of two empty stores in the Venetian Isles Shopping Center, and by this point the library had 921 members. Circulation grew from 314 books in 1965 to over 10,000 books in 1968. In 1972, the Library began to function under the jurisdiction of the City of Lighthouse Point. In 1984, the Publix in the Venetian Sopping center announced its plan to take over the entire shopping area, and the contents of the library was moved into a huge trailed unit in November 1985 and stored on the grounds of the Trinity United Methodist Church. The city commission pitched an idea to build a complex with the library as a focal point, and in the meantime library staff worked out of the storage unit. It wasn&#x27;t until May 1987 that the move into the current permanent library began with over 20,000 items and more than 7,000 library memberships.

The library has a print collection of over 40,000 circulating titles, patron wifi access, public computers, a fax machine, scanning and printing, AWE Kids Learning Stations, Overdrive eBooks and streaming audio-books, access to the Florida Electronic Library and digital research databases, audio books on CD, DVDs, magazines and newspapers, study rooms (by appointment), and exam proctoring (by appointment only).

<text>Miramar is a city in southern Broward County, Florida, United States. It is a suburb of the Miami metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the population was 134,721, making it the fourth-largest city in Broward County, the sixth-largest city in the Miami metro area, and the 14th-largest city in Florida.

==History==

Miramar was founded by A.L. Mailman to serve as a &quot;bedroom community&quot; for nearby Miami and Fort Lauderdale. Mailman bought the original property he was to develop from H.D. Perry Sr. in 1953. He built 56 homes on the property that were inexpensive homes of concrete and flat roofs. These homes sold quickly because of the low cost of both the homes and the land, and the city of Miramar came into being.

The city was incorporated on May 26, 1955, and was named for the Miramar area of Havana, Cuba where Mailman had a summer home (Miramar translates to &quot;look at the sea&quot; in Spanish). At the time of incorporation, the city had a population of less than 200 people. With approximately 2.9 square miles of land area, Miramar&#x27;s original city boundaries were Southwest 64 Avenue on the east, University Drive on the west, the Dade County line on the south, and Pembroke Road on the north. On June 20, 1955, the city&#x27;s first mayor (Robert Gordon) and city council were sworn in, all of whom were appointed by the governor and served until January 1959, at which time the first municipal election was held. Mayor Robert Gordon is the individual who is attributed to have given the city its name. The city seal is inscribed with the motto &quot;Beauty and Progress&quot;.

H.D. Perry Sr.&#x27;s part in Miramar did not cease with selling the land to Mailman for development. He is recognized as one of the pioneers in the history of Miramar. His character and civic-activities influenced not only the lives of early residents but continues to the present day, as evidenced by the schools and parks in the city which bear his family&#x27;s name. Many long-time residents fondly recall the community barbecues hosted by Mr. and Mrs. Perry during those early years. Others are grateful to Mr. Perry for the lessons in animal husbandry, which he conducted for the benefit of Miramar&#x27;s youth so that they could learn something of farm life.

The only major roads when Miramar was developed were U.S. 441 which was a two-lane road at that time, Hallandale Beach Boulevard to Southwest 66 Terrace and Pembroke Road which was a dirt road to University Drive. There were no other transportation routes of any kind supplying access to the new community. Miramar&#x27;s early city fathers advocated the philosophy of planned and controlled growth. The city adopted a Comprehensive Land Use Plan in 1972 before cities and counties were mandated to do so. This provided the framework for the orderly development of future growth. Two-thirds of the land within city limits is currently undeveloped.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (5.66%) is water.

A 2017 study put the city in fifth place for US cities most vulnerable to coastal flooding, with 93,000 residents living within FEMA&#x27;s coastal floodplain.

==Government==

===Municipal government===

On June 20, 1955, the city&#x27;s inaugural mayor and city council were sworn in, all having been appointed by the Governor of Florida. They all served until the city&#x27;s first municipal elections were held in 1959.

The city&#x27;s current mayor is Wayne Messam.

Miramar currently operates under a council–manager government.

Up until March 13, 1991, the city had previously operated under the &quot;strong mayor&quot; form of the mayor–city council form of government. In 1989, by unanimous accord of the mayor and the Miramar City Commission, work was laid to study changing to a council–manager form of government. On March 14, 1990, Miramar voters approved a referendum to change to this form of government.

<doc id="109053" wikidata="Q176110" url="?curid=109053" title="Insulated-gate bipolar transistor">
<text>An insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is a three-terminal power semiconductor device primarily forming an electronic switch. It was developed to combine high efficiency with fast switching. It consists of four alternating layers (NPNP) that are controlled by a metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) gate structure.

Although the structure of the IGBT is topologically similar to a thyristor with a &quot;MOS&quot; gate (MOS-gate thyristor), the thyristor action is completely suppressed, and only the transistor action is permitted in the entire device operation range. It is used in switching power supplies in high-power applications: variable-frequency drives (VFDs) for motor control in electric cars, trains, variable-speed refrigerators, and air conditioners, as well as lamp ballasts, arc-welding machines, photovoltaic and hybrid inverters, uninterruptible power supply systems (UPS), and induction stoves.

Since it is designed to turn on and off rapidly, the IGBT can synthesize complex waveforms with pulse-width modulation and low-pass filters, thus it is also used in switching amplifiers in sound systems and industrial control systems. In switching applications modern devices feature pulse repetition rates well into the ultrasonic-range frequencies, which are at least ten times higher than audio frequencies handled by the device when used as an analog audio amplifier. , the IGBT was the second most widely used power transistor, after the power MOSFET.
==Device structure==

An IGBT cell is constructed similarly to an n-channel vertical-construction power MOSFET, except the n+ drain is replaced with a p+ collector layer, thus forming a vertical PNP bipolar junction transistor.
This additional p+ region creates a cascade connection of a PNP bipolar junction transistor with the surface n-channel MOSFET. The whole structure comprises a four layered NPNP.

==Difference between thyristor and IGBT==

==History==

The bipolar point-contact transistor was invented in December 1947 at the Bell Telephone Laboratories by John Bardeen and Walter Brattain under the direction of William Shockley. The junction version known as the bipolar junction transistor (BJT), invented by Shockley in 1948. Later the similar thyristor was proposed by William Shockley in 1950 and developed in 1956 by power engineers at General Electric (GE). The metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) was also invented at Bell Labs. In 1957 Frosch and Derick published their work on building the first silicon dioxide transistors, including a NPNP transistor, the same structure as the IGBT. The basic IGBT mode of operation, where a pnp transistor is driven by a MOSFET, was first proposed by K. Yamagami and Y. Akagiri of Mitsubishi Electric in the Japanese patent S47-21739, which was filed in 1968.
In 1978 J. D. Plummer and B. Scharf patented a NPNP transistor device combining MOS and bipolar capabilities for power control and switching. The development of IGBT was characterized by the efforts to completely suppress the thyristor operation or the latch-up in the four-layer device because the latch-up caused the fatal device failure. IGBTs had, thus, been established when the complete suppression of the latch-up of the parasitic thyristor was achieved. Later, Hans W. Becke and Carl F. Wheatley developed a similar device claiming non-latch-up. They patented the device in 1980, referring to it as &quot;power MOSFET with an anode region&quot; for which &quot;no thyristor action occurs under any device operating conditions&quot;.

A. Nakagawa et al. invented the device design concept of non-latch-up IGBTs in 1984. The invention is characterized by the device design setting the device saturation current below the latch-up current, which triggers the parasitic thyristor. This invention realized complete suppression of the parasitic thyristor action, for the first time, because the maximal collector current was limited by the saturation current and never exceeded the latch-up current.

In the early development stage of IGBT, all the researchers tried to increase the latch-up current itself in order to suppress the latch-up of the parasitic thyristor. However, all these efforts failed because IGBT could conduct enormously large current. Successful suppression of the latch-up was made possible by limiting the maximal collector current, which IGBT could conduct, below the latch-up current by controlling/reducing the saturation current of the inherent MOSFET. This was the concept of non-latch-up IGBT. &quot;Becke’s device&quot; was made possible by the non-latch-up IGBT.

The IGBT is characterized by its ability to simultaneously handle a high voltage and a large current. The product of the voltage and the current density that the IGBT can handle reached more than 5 W/cm2, which far exceeded the value, 2 W/cm2, of existing power devices such as bipolar transistors and power MOSFETs. This is a consequence of the large safe operating area of the IGBT. The IGBT is the most rugged and the strongest power device yet developed, affording ease of use and so displacing bipolar transistors and even gate turn-off thyristors (GTOs). 
This excellent feature of the IGBT had suddenly emerged when the non-latch-up IGBT was established in 1984 by solving the problem of so-called &quot;latch-up&quot;, which is the main cause of device destruction or device failure. Before that, the developed devices were very weak and were easily destroyed by &quot;latch-up&quot;.

===Practical devices===
Practical devices capable of operating over an extended current range were first reported by B. Jayant Baliga et al. in 1982. The first experimental demonstration of a practical discrete vertical IGBT device was reported by Baliga at the IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) that year. General Electric commercialized Baliga&#x27;s IGBT device the same year. Baliga was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for the invention of the IGBT.

A similar paper was also submitted by J. P. Russel et al. to IEEE Electron Device Letter in 1982. The applications for the device were initially regarded by the power electronics community to be severely restricted by its slow switching speed and latch-up of the parasitic thyristor structure inherent within the device. However, it was demonstrated by Baliga and also by A. M. Goodman et al. in 1983 that the switching speed could be adjusted over a broad range by using electron irradiation. This was followed by demonstration of operation of the device at elevated temperatures by Baliga in 1985. Successful efforts to suppress the latch-up of the parasitic thyristor and the scaling of the voltage rating of the devices at GE allowed the introduction of commercial devices in 1983, which could be used for a wide variety of applications. The electrical characteristics of GE&#x27;s device, IGT D94FQ/FR4, were reported in detail by Marvin W. Smith in the proceedings of PCI April 1984. Smith showed in Fig. 12 of the proceedings that turn-off above 10 amperes for gate resistance of 5 kΩ and above 5 amperes for gate resistance of 1 kΩ was limited by switching safe operating area although IGT D94FQ/FR4 was able to conduct 40 amperes of collector current. Smith also stated that the switching safe operating area was limited by the latch-up of the parasitic thyristor.

Complete suppression of the parasitic thyristor action and the resultant non-latch-up IGBT operation for the entire device operation range was achieved by A. Nakagawa et al. in 1984. The non-latch-up design concept was filed for US patents. To test the lack of latch-up, the prototype 1200 V IGBTs were directly connected without any loads across a 600 V constant-voltage source and were switched on for 25 microseconds. The entire 600 V was dropped across the device, and a large short-circuit current flowed. The devices successfully withstood this severe condition. This was the first demonstration of so-called &quot;short-circuit-withstanding-capability&quot; in IGBTs. Non-latch-up IGBT operation was ensured, for the first time, for the entire device operation range. In this sense, the non-latch-up IGBT proposed by Hans W. Becke and Carl F. Wheatley was realized by A. Nakagawa et al. in 1984. Products of non-latch-up IGBTs were first commercialized by Toshiba in 1985. This was the real birth of the present IGBT.

Once the non-latch-up capability was achieved in IGBTs, it was found that IGBTs exhibited very rugged and a very large safe operating area. It was demonstrated that the product of the operating current density and the collector voltage exceeded the theoretical limit of bipolar transistors, 2 W/cm2 and reached 5 W/cm2.

The insulating material is typically made of solid polymers, which have issues with degradation. There are developments that use an ion gel to improve manufacturing and reduce the voltage required.

The first-generation IGBTs of the 1980s and early 1990s were prone to failure through effects such as latchup (in which the device will not turn off as long as current is flowing) and secondary breakdown (in which a localized hotspot in the device goes into thermal runaway and burns the device out at high currents). Second-generation devices were much improved. The current third-generation IGBTs are even better, with speed rivaling power MOSFETs and excellent ruggedness and tolerance of overloads. Extremely high pulse ratings of second- and third-generation devices also make them useful for generating large power pulses in areas including particle and plasma physics, where they are starting to supersede older devices such as thyratrons and triggered spark gaps. High pulse ratings and low prices on the surplus market also make them attractive to the high-voltage hobbyists for controlling large amounts of power to drive devices such as solid-state Tesla coils and coilguns.
==Applications==

, the IGBT is the second most widely used power transistor, after the power MOSFET. The IGBT accounts for 27% of the power transistor market, second only to the power MOSFET (53%), and ahead of the RF amplifier (11%) and bipolar junction transistor (9%). The IGBT is widely used in consumer electronics, industrial technology, the energy sector, aerospace electronic devices, and transportation.

==Advantages==
The IGBT combines the simple gate-drive characteristics of power MOSFETs with the high-current and low-saturation-voltage capability of bipolar transistors. The IGBT combines an isolated-gate FET for the control input and a bipolar power transistor as a switch in a single device. The IGBT is used in medium- to high-power applications like switched-mode power supplies, traction motor control and induction heating. Large IGBT modules typically consist of many devices in parallel and can have very high current-handling capabilities in the order of hundreds of amperes with blocking voltages of . These IGBTs can control loads of hundreds of kilowatts.

==Comparison with power MOSFETs==
An IGBT features a significantly lower forward voltage drop compared to a conventional MOSFET in higher blocking voltage rated devices, although MOSFETS exhibit much lower forward voltage at lower current densities due to the absence of a diode Vf in the IGBT&#x27;s output BJT. As the blocking voltage rating of both MOSFET and IGBT devices increases, the depth of the n- drift region must increase and the doping must decrease, resulting in roughly square relationship decrease in forward conduction versus blocking voltage capability of the device. By injecting minority carriers (holes) from the collector p+ region into the n- drift region during forward conduction, the resistance of the n- drift region is considerably reduced. However, this resultant reduction in on-state forward voltage comes with several penalties:

* The additional PN junction blocks reverse current flow. This means that unlike a MOSFET, IGBTs cannot conduct in the reverse direction. In bridge circuits, where reverse current flow is needed, an additional diode (called a freewheeling diode) is placed in anti-parallel with the IGBT to conduct current in the opposite direction. The penalty isn&#x27;t overly severe because at higher voltages, where IGBT usage dominates, discrete diodes have a significantly higher performance than the body diode of a MOSFET.
* The reverse bias rating of the N-drift region to collector P+ diode is usually only of tens of volts, so if the circuit application applies a reverse voltage to the IGBT, an additional series diode must be used.
* The minority carriers injected into the N-drift region take time to enter and exit or recombine at turn-on and turn-off. This results in longer switching times, and hence higher compared to a power MOSFET. 
* The on-state forward voltage drop in IGBTs behaves very differently from power MOSFETS. The MOSFET voltage drop can be modeled as a resistance, with the voltage drop proportional to current. By contrast, the IGBT has a diode-like voltage drop (typically of the order of 2V) increasing only with the log of the current. Additionally, MOSFET resistance is typically lower for smaller blocking voltages, so the choice between IGBTs and power MOSFETS will depend on both the blocking voltage and current involved in a particular application.

In general, high voltage, high current and lower frequencies favor the IGBT while low voltage, medium current and high switching frequencies are the domain of the MOSFET.

==Modeling==
Circuits with IGBTs can be developed and modeled with various circuit simulating computer programs such as SPICE, Saber, and other programs. To simulate an IGBT circuit, the device (and other devices in the circuit) must have a model which predicts or simulates the device&#x27;s response to various voltages and currents on their electrical terminals. For more precise simulations the effect of temperature on various parts of the IGBT may be included with the simulation.
Two common methods of modeling are available: device physics-based model, equivalent circuits or macromodels. SPICE simulates IGBTs using a macromodel that combines an ensemble of components like FETs and BJTs in a Darlington configuration. An alternative physics-based model is the Hefner model, introduced by Allen Hefner of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Hefner&#x27;s model is fairly complex but has shown good results. Hefner&#x27;s model is described in a 1988 paper and was later extended to a thermo-electrical model which include the IGBT&#x27;s response to internal heating. This model has been added to a version of the Saber simulation software.

==IGBT failure mechanisms==
The failure mechanisms of IGBTs includes overstress (O) and wearout (wo) separately.

The wearout failures mainly include bias temperature instability (BTI), hot carrier injection (HCI), time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB), electromigration (ECM), solder fatigue, material reconstruction, corrosion. The overstress failures mainly include electrostatic discharge (ESD), latch-up, avalanche, secondary breakdown, wire-bond liftoff and burnout.

<text>North Lauderdale is a city in Broward County, Florida, United States. It is a principal city of the Miami metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population was 44,794.

==History==
At its creation in 1963, it was largely farmland on the western edge of development in Broward County. North Lauderdale was originally grazing pasture for cows and horses of the Anderson Dairy Farm and also an agricultural area for the Lena Lyons Stringbean Farm. Recognizing a rare opportunity to work with a blank slate, famed architect Morris Lapidus turned his attention to planning a city that would become North Lauderdale. Lapidus gained international notoriety for launching the 1950s “Miami Beach” style resort hotel. His design of the Fontainebleau Resort, the Eden Roc and Americana helped create the style of Miami Beach. After hotels, Lapidus turned to designing cities. North Lauderdale, “The City of Tomorrow”, was the first city he laid out. Residents still benefit from his influence and vision, which can be seen in the whimsical “beacons” lending the city prominence and in the distinct, amoebic shape of Boulevard of Champions. In the late 1960s, recognizing the growing demand for single-family homes, the Osias Organization, headed by Colonel Nathan Rood, who was also the first appointed Mayor, purchased most of the land and began the development of North Lauderdale proper. In April 1969, by straw vote, Michael Saraniero became the city&#x27;s first elected Mayor.

Once the city was laid out, the promise of affordable homes near the seaside ushered in a 10-year development boom in the 1970s. Where the rich and famous flocked to Miami Beach, regular families enamored with the Sun Belt, moved to North Lauderdale. Thousands moved in and neighborhood after neighborhood came to life. The city&#x27;s character took shape of a younger, family-oriented community where most social interaction took place after work around a softball field. North Lauderdale is a city where a week of hard work is rewarded with sunshine-filled weekends and family barbecues.

==Geography==
The approximate coordinates for the City of North Lauderdale is located at in north-central Broward County. It is adjacent to the following municipalities:

On its north:
* Margate

On its northwest:
* Coral Springs

On its west and south:
* Tamarac

On its east:
* Fort Lauderdale

On its northeast:
* Pompano Beach

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.72%) is water.

==Climate==
North Lauderdale has a tropical climate, similar to the climate found in much of the Caribbean. It is part of the only region in the 48 contiguous states that falls under that category. More specifically, it generally has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Af&quot;), bordering a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Am&quot;).

==Demographics==
===2010 and 2020 census===

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 44,794 people, 14,049 households, and 9,412 families residing in the city.

==History==
Originally named Floranada (a blend of Florida and Canada), the town was forced into bankruptcy after the hurricane of 1926. When the municipality reincorporated, residents chose to make it a city and voted for the name Oakland Park. The original boundaries went from the Atlantic Ocean, west to what is now U.S. 441, and from the north fork of Middle River north to Cypress Creek Boulevard, but when the boundaries were reestablished, it was to approximately the west side of U.S. 1, west to Northeast 3rd Avenue and the north fork of Middle River north to what is now Prospect Road.

<doc id="109061" wikidata="Q370972" url="?curid=109061" title="Pembroke Pines, Florida">
<text>Pembroke Pines is a city in southern Broward County, Florida, United States. The city is located 22 miles (35 km) north of Miami. It is a suburb of and the fourth-most populous city in the Miami metropolitan area. The population of Pembroke Pines was 171,178 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Pembroke Pines was officially incorporated on January 16, 1960. The city&#x27;s name, Pembroke Pines, is traced back to Sir Edward J. Reed, a member of Britain&#x27;s Parliament for the County of Pembroke from 1874 to 1880, who in 1882, formed the Florida Land and Mortgage Company to purchase from Hamilton Disston a total of 2 million acres of mostly swampland located throughout the southern half of Florida. A road put through one of the tracts came to be known as Pembroke Road. When incorporating the city, Walter Smith Kipnis, who became the city&#x27;s first mayor, suggested the name Pembroke Pines because of the pine trees growing near Pembroke Road.

The first inhabitants of the area were Native Americans, who first appeared about 4,000 years ago. Skeletal remains of animal hunters dating back about 10,000 years were found around Broward County, showing that perhaps human beings had lived in the area even earlier.

The community started as agricultural land occupied by dairy farms, and grew after World War II as service members were retiring, including large eastern sections that were part of the Waldrep Dairy Farm, including the present-day Pembroke Lakes Mall. The first two subdivisions were called Pembroke Pines. One of the first homes in the city belonged to Kipnis, the city&#x27;s first mayor, and was built in 1956. It was then known as the &quot;Village of Pembroke Pines&quot; and was incorporated into a village in 1959. Builders contested the incorporation, so a legal battle ensued concerning the boundaries of the new municipality. City services were added in the 1960s with the building of the first fire department building near North Perry Airport. University Drive was then the western edge of habitable land for residents.

In January 1960, Pembroke Pines held another election, and the village became a city. This small property was less than a square mile and was between Hollywood Boulevard and SW 72nd Avenue, and had the Florida Turnpike to the east. Pembroke Pines sought to give citizens involvement, so they organized the Pembroke Pines Civic Association. The square-mile city was unable to expand due to North Perry Airport and the South Florida State Hospital. Joseph LaCroix, a developer, had his of land north of Pines Boulevard annexed to the city. This gave a new pathway to proceed westward. In 1977, a maximum security prison known as the Broward Correctional Institution was built in the northwestern part of town. This facility closed in 2012. In 1980, property from Flamingo Road to U.S. 27 was incorporated into Pembroke Pines, doubling the size of the city. This expansion included the property that is currently C.B. Smith Park as well as what was once the Hollywood Sportatorium and the Miami-Hollywood Motorsports Park. Also, in 1980, construction began to extend Interstate 75 from U.S. 27 towards Miami, passing through the new western part of the city. By 1984 the expressway reached Pines Boulevard, the main east-west arterial road in the city.

In May 1977, the Grateful Dead put on a storied performance at the Hollywood Sportatorium. Many Deadheads consider the version of &quot;Sugaree&quot; played during the first set to be the band&#x27;s—and particularly guitarist Jerry Garcia&#x27;s—finest performance of the song.

The city&#x27;s rapid population growth in the mid-to late 1990s was part of the effect of Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Thousands of southern Miami-Dade County residents moved northward to Broward County, many to Pembroke Pines. The resulting boom ranked the City of Pembroke Pines third in a list of &quot;Fastest Growing Cities&quot; in the United States, in 1999. The increase in population has increased the need for schools. In 2003, Charles W. Flanagan High School had close to 6,000 students, making it the most populated high school in Florida. In response to Broward County&#x27;s need to keep up with demands, Mayor Alex Fekete and City Manager Charles Dodge started a charter school system. As of 2006, Pembroke Pines had the largest charter school system in the county. The city is also home to campuses for Broward College and Florida International University. The city&#x27;s population had grown from 65,452 in 1990 to 157,594 in 2011.

In 2001, Pembroke Pines was home to the most dangerous road intersection (Pines Boulevard and Flamingo Road) in the United States, according to State Farm Insurance. City residents passed a bond initiative to allow the city to begin construction to redesign the intersection. The intersection has since been expanded with additional east/west Pines Boulevard lanes.

As developers expanded Pembroke Pines westward, more hurricanes have affected the city and its residents. In 1999, Hurricane Irene dumped up to of rain in the city. The western communities, such as Chapel Trail and Silver Lakes, received an estimated . Then in 2004, Hurricane Frances and Jeanne passed to the north (Palm Beach County), but brought tropical storm-force winds and left minor tree and shrub damage. The 2005 hurricane season left a mark on the city. Hurricane Katrina passed directly over the city as a category-one storm. In its wake, it left some damage, such as downed power lines and trees, especially in the Chapel Trail and Silver Lakes developments. In late October, the eye of Hurricane Wilma passed about toward the north of the city, which saw the strongest winds its residents had experienced in decades. The strongest wind officially recorded in the city was a sustained wind, with a wind gust. Most of the city was left without power for days, lights at intersections had been destroyed, a riot at a gas station led to it being closed, most landscaping was destroyed or damaged beyond repair, and minor structural damage (mainly roof and screen damage) occurred. In addition, schools remained closed for two weeks.

<text>Plantation is a city in Broward County, Florida, United States. It is a part of the South Florida metropolitan area. The city&#x27;s name comes from the previous part-owner of the land, the Everglades Plantation Company, and their unsuccessful attempts to establish a rice plantation in the area. As of the 2020 U.S. census, the population was 91,750.

==History==
=== Land acquisition and drainage (1855–1930) ===
Before the start of the 20th century, the area that became Plantation was part of the Everglades wetlands, regularly covered by 2–3 feet of water. In 1855, Florida state passed the Internal Improvement Act and established the Internal Improvement Trust Fund, the trustees of which act as a government agency to oversee the management, sale, and development of state land. In 1897, the Interior Department submitted 2.9 million acres to the Florida Land Office; however, the submission was revoked the following year, due to fears it would &quot;impinge upon the rights and interests of the Seminole Tribes.&quot; The Seminole people regularly used the area for hunting, fishing, and camping, and also used the nearby Pine Island Ridge as a headquarters during the second and third Seminole Wars.

In 1899, Florida Governor William Sherman Jennings began an initiative to drain the Everglades. To establish Florida&#x27;s entitlement to the land, Jennings obtained a new patent (known as the &#x27;Everglades Patent&#x27;) for land &quot;aggregating 2,862,280 acres.&quot; Following his election in 1905, Jennings&#x27; successor, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward appointed Jennings as general counsel of the Internal Improvement Fund and continued the initiative for complete drainage of the Everglades (which was a core theme of his election campaign). Broward described the drainage as a duty of the trustees, and promised to create an &quot;Empire of the Everglades&quot;.

The first attempts to drain the Everglades began in 1906, with the building and launching of two dredges into the New River: &quot;The Okeechobee&quot; (commanded by Captain Walter S. Holloway of the US Army Corps of Engineers) began cutting from the river&#x27;s south fork (establishing the South New River Canal), and &quot;The Everglades&quot; began cutting from the north fork up to Lake Okeechobee (establishing the North New River Canal). The first waterway opened after the drainage attempts were named The Holloway Canal, after Captain Holloway.

Following a meeting at the 1908 Democratic National Convention, Broward and Jennings established a deal with Richard &#x27;Dicky&#x27; J. Bolles: The fund trustees granted Bolles of overflowed state lands at $2 per acre, with an agreement for the State to use 50% of the $1 million proceeds purely for drainage and reclamation, and another agreement to establish 5 main canals. Following this, Bolles founded the Florida Fruit Lands Company, becoming the Everglades&#x27; first private developer.

The Everglades Plantation Company was established in January 1909, following entry into a 2-year contract with the Internal Improvement Fund trustees by Adam A. Boggs (attorney and vice president of the Miami Bank and Trust Company) and A.B. Sanders (engineer and later president of the Miami Engineering and Construction Company) to create a rice plantation in the Everglades. The agreement enabled Boggs &amp; Sanders to rent a significant amount of land around the (then work-in-progress) North New River Canal, and also subsequently purchase the land for between $3 and $15 per acre.

It was later discovered that the area leased to Boggs &amp; Sanders already belonged to Dicky Bolles, as part of the 500,000 acres he had purchased; however, the Everglades Plantation Company was able to retain the land, despite Bolles&#x27; claims. Sanders led further reclamation efforts for the area, including the digging of 60 miles of ditches. Boggs &amp; Sanders were also granted extensions to their 2-year contract, on the grounds that the land remained underwater.

In 1911, Bolles held a land lottery (known as the Progresso Land Auction) at $20–24 per acre, granting residential lots in the Town of Progresso (now the area known as Wilton Manors) to anyone purchasing farmland of five acres or more in the drainage land;&quot;&quot; however, no auction actually took place and the purchased land remained under water. As a result, a lawsuit was brought against Bolles.

In 1912, the North New River Canal opened, and the Sewell Lock (also known as Lock No.1), the first lock in Florida, and one of the older remaining structures in Broward County, was built on it, just outside of what is now Plantation. The lock enabled access between the Everglades and Lake Okeechobee by water.

The lawsuit against Bolles was settled in November 1913, with Bolles retaining the $1.4 million already received, but prohibiting any further collection until the land was drained and surveyed. Bolles was also arrested in December of that year but was subsequently found innocent.

Drainage of the land largely failed, with most of it reverting to the state for taxes; however, two local farmers, O. L Daniel and Dewey Hawkins began buying it, acquiring approximately 6,000 acres and 4,000 acres respectively.&quot;&quot;

In the years following their original agreement, contract negotiation escalated into legal battles between the Everglades Plantation Company and the Internal Improvement Trustees. These disputes ended in 1914, in the company&#x27;s favor. The Trustees no longer insisted on the continuation of the rice plantation attempts and, from this point, the company focused primarily on land sales.

Broward County (originally planned under the name Everglades County but ultimately named after former governor Broward) was created by the Florida legislature in 1915 by combining portions of Dade County and Palm Beach County.

Driven by the success of the drainage projects, the Florida Land Boom took place between 1920 and 1925, seeing rapid growth in population and land sales. The boom reached its peak in the fall of 1925 and subsequently collapsed in 1926.

The land boom was closely followed by two severe hurricanes striking the area, significantly impacting the established communities and killing thousands. The first, in September 1926 (known as the 1926 Miami hurricane), reached wind speeds of 140 miles per hour, and the second, in September 1928 (known as the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane), reached wind speeds of 135 miles per hour. In response, additional flood control laws were established, and millions of additional dollars were spent on drainage efforts across the Everglades in the subsequent decades.

=== Initial development (1931–1952) ===
Future Plantation founder, Frederick C. Peters, the millionaire heir to a shoe business, moved to Goulds, Florida in 1931 (following doctor&#x27;s advice to seek a warmer climate for his son), beginning both potato and cattle businesses; however, in 1939, Peters received advice from Stephan Zacher (a ranch-owner) to find better land for his cattle in Davie, Florida. With most large tracts of land in Davie already established as groves, Peters (following extensive testing by the United States Soil Conservation Service) purchased further north for approximately $10–25 per acre, financed with a $350,000 mortgage. The land was previously owned by Dewey Hawkins (who held the majority) and by Boggs&#x27; and Sanders&#x27; Everglades Plantation Company.

With the aim to create a farming-cooperative-based, rural alternative to suburban Dade Country, Peters built the city&#x27;s first ranch buildings, which were designed by Stephan Zacher. In 1942, he had Leslie E. Bitting (son of Ben Bitting, who worked at Peters&#x27; previous Dade County farm) begin moving Peters&#x27; cattle to the area, and look after the building.&quot;&quot;

Between 1944 and 1945, Peters shifted from the idea of building a farming cooperative, hiring architect Russell Pancoast to assist with the creation of the city master plan, and C. Kay Davis to establish a water control system. In 1946, a special-purpose local government, named the Old Plantation Water Control District, was also chartered by the state (led by civil engineer John Brendla) to commence drainage of the area previously intended for plantation development, and oversee its secondary canals.&quot;&quot;

Chauncey Clark Jr. (originally from Michigan, but living in Miami Beach) was told by Peters that, in exchange for an effective development plan, Peters would provide land options and complete drainage &amp; access as needed. Clark Jr.&#x27;s plan for 40 acre ranches, clubs, golf courses and an airfield failed to attract investment, but his father, Chauncey Clark Sr., established an alternative plan for single-acre lots with 2-bedroom houses and a 20-tree orchard in each. Miami&#x27;s Robert Law Weed designed the first homes, which were then built in 1947, on East Acre Drive under the name Plantation Homes Inc. The development&#x27;s name (which went on to become the name of the entire city) came from that by which the area had become known, including its Water Control District subdivision, &#x27;Plantation&#x27;.

Clark&#x27;s advertising referred to Plantation as &quot;the Dream City&quot; with &quot;Rich Living at Small Cost&quot; and Peters&#x27; advertising described &quot;A Full Acre with Every Home.&quot;&quot;&quot; A two-bedroom home with an acre of land and 20 fruit trees was sold for $10,241, and the property was valued at $200 per acre;&quot;&quot; however, early into construction, many of the homes were destroyed by flooding, caused by 93 consecutive days of rain and two hurricanes.&quot;&quot; Despite the setbacks, 15 houses were under construction at the time the hurricanes passed.&quot;&quot; Clark repaired and restored all of the homes damaged at his own personal expense. During this same year, road-builder Finley Smith began plans to expand Broward Boulevard from State Road 7 to the Holloway Canal.&quot;&quot;

In 1948, Chauncey Clark Jr.&#x27;s home was the first completed, and Clark moved into the house with his family.&quot;&quot; Construction operations expanded, alongside a dedicated sales group, with approximately three houses being completed and sold per week.&quot;&quot; A total of approximately 120 homes were built that year,&quot;&quot; and the city&#x27;s population grew to 30 families in size.&quot;&quot; That year, Ann Carter (wife of Claude E, Carter) also gave birth to Eugene Carter, the first child born in the city.&quot;&quot; 1948 also saw the completion of new dikes and a pumping station on the East Holloway Canal,&quot;&quot; and formation of The Plantation Community Church (which held its first services in the construction trailer office of Frederick Peters).

In September and October 1948, two hurricanes impacted the area, causing flooding and the breakage of a work-in-progress dike during the second hurricane.&quot;&quot; Rapid repairs and extensions to the dikes, new cofferdams, and pumping were used to end the flooding;&quot;&quot; however, house sales halted in 1949 due to the repeated flooding. Although work continued on new roads, dikes, and houses, Clark&#x27;s Plantation Homes Inc. was dissolved, and the assets went to Frederick C. Peters.&quot;&quot;

1949 also saw the opening of Plantation Pumping Station No. 2 (allowing the pumping of 126 million gallons per day into the North New River Canal), the founding of the Plantation Women&#x27;s Club (by Mrs. Helen Hoffman), and the founding of the Plantation Homeowners&#x27; organization (by Dr. Abram Hoffman). At this time, there were 40 occupied homes in the area.

1950 then saw the completion of the Plantation Golf Course and Country Club, built with the intent to encourage the westward extension of Broward Boulevard.

=== City incorporation (1953–1963) ===
The city of Plantation was incorporated as a city on April 23, 1953 (with a population of 300 and a budget of less than $2,000 at the time). The Plantation Homeowners Association appointed Ellsworth D. Gage (then president of the Homeowners&#x27; Association) as the city&#x27;s first Mayor, with Paul Stoner, Winslow Freeman, George Bartold, Walter Bartels, and Wilfred J. Perry Lohman elected to the City Council; however, none of these early city officials took any salary from the position. A building originally intended as a community center, but being used as a warehouse, was used for the first city council meeting, city hall, fire station, and police station. This building, originally known as the Hoffman Building, is now the kitchen area of Deicke Auditorium.

On August 1, 1954, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; publicly unveiled the city plan, calling Plantation &quot;The City of the Future&quot;.

In 1955, S. Robinson Estey was elected as the city&#x27;s second mayor (and the first elected to the position). Plantation Police Dept. was organized in the same year, with the first police car and officer (Henry C. &#x27;Hank&#x27; Donath), who ran the department alone for several years, on call 24 hours per day. At that time, the city population remained less than 800 people.

The city&#x27;s fire department&#x27;s barbecue fundraiser began in 1956 and remains one of the city&#x27;s annual traditions. Plantation&#x27;s Volunteer Fire Dept. was subsequently formed in 1957, with Richard Stephenson appointed as the first Fire Chief. The city&#x27;s first industrial plant (Airpax Products, Co.) opened on Sunrise Blvd in 1957 (in what is now Plantation Technology Park), as did Plantation Community Church&#x27;s first sanctuary (now known as Missions Prayer Chapel) and the Sunshine State Parkway (now known as Florida&#x27;s Turnpike), which connected Miami and Fort Pierce, Florida. By 1958, construction was completed on the City Hall. A fire station was built on Broward Boulevard, with Frederick T. Peters (son of Frederick C. Peters) appointed as the city&#x27;s fire chief.

Plantation&#x27;s budget had grown to over $170,000 by 1959. That year, the city&#x27;s first school was dedicated: Berenice Todd Peters Elementary School (named after the wife of city founder Frederick C. Peters; known today as Peters Elementary) was a 24-classroom, 725-child school, built on 10 acres of land given by Frederick Peters. Hank Donath was appointed as the city&#x27;s first police chief, with the operating costs of the police department covered by cigarette taxes.

In 1960, the city adopted the slogan &quot;The Dream City&quot;, including matching license plates.

The Plantation Library, based out of Peters Elementary School, was founded in 1961, with Helen B. Hoffman as chairwoman and members of the Plantation Woman&#x27;s Club as volunteer workers. In 1962, Edwin Deicke donated $100,000 to the city for expanding and renovating the Hoffman Building (which was renamed to the Deicke Auditorium in 1973). Also in 1962, the city&#x27;s chamber of commerce was founded and the Doctors General Hospital was opened.

The city&#x27;s population reached 8,500 in 1963,&quot;&quot; and its original motto &quot;From the Wilderness, This City&quot; was made official, with the adoption of a corresponding city seal (designed by Mayor Robinson Estey and architect A.T. Hardel). The Latin translation of this motto was found to include a spelling error; however, future mayor, Frank Veltri opted not to change it. The city&#x27;s community center, designed by original city master plan architect Russell Pancoast, was built in 1963, becoming the site of the first city library (which had been housed in Peters Elementary).

=== Gulfstream developments (1964–1979) ===
Following the death of Frederick C. Peters in July 1964, the Peters family sold of undeveloped land west of University Drive (originally named Annapu Road) at approximately $3,000 per acre to the Gulfstream Land Development Company, led by president John H. Cleary. The land is purchased for the development of the Jacaranda community, the intent of which was to build an equivalent to Coral Gables in Broward County.

Other expansions during this time included Plantation Elementary School in 1965, The Florida Air Academy in 1969, Plantation High School (the city&#x27;s first high school) and Plantation General Hospital (at the time, a 264-bed hospital) in 1966, and a facility for the telecommunications company Motorola in 1969.

The city&#x27;s population reached 23,523 by 1970, and in 1972, a $1.03 million construction bid was accepted for a new city hall, alongside groundbreaking for construction of the Deicke Auditorium.

Plantation Acres (which is designated a Special Public Interest Rural District to protect the natural landscape) and Melaleuca Isles were annexed into Plantation in 1973. Deicke Auditorium and the new Plantation City Hall were dedicated in May and December of that year respectively. Also in 1973, the Gulfstream consortium acquired the remaining land from the Peters family holdings. Moving away from Plantation&#x27;s original rural direction, Gulfstream instead targeted commercial, industrial and home office establishments, beginning agreements with Motorola, American Express, and those who would build the Broward Mall. The Plantation Historical Society was founded the following year by Genevieve Veltri, Dorothy O&#x27;Hare, Lois Brickhouse, and Marilyn King, with their first meeting held in the Veltri home, and Veltri elected as the first president.

Frank Veltri was elected as the city&#x27;s mayor for the first time in 1975. Veltri became the city&#x27;s longest-serving mayor, completing six terms over 24 years. That same year, the financial services company, American Express moved its &#x27;Southern Region Operations Center&#x27; to a newly constructed building in Plantation, beginning with 1,000 employees.

During the US bicentennial celebration in 1976, a 45-foot oak tree was planted in Plantation&#x27;s Fifth Street Park to represent the Liberty Tree. The park was renamed Liberty Tree Park as a result. In 1977, the city and Broward County jointly acquired land which was previously a part of the Peters family farm, and began work on the Plantation Heritage Park, using a grant from the Land and Water Conservation Fund.

The Broward Mall opened in 1978, on what had previously been cow pasture land. At the time, it was the largest mall in the Southern United States, spanning 1 million square feet. 1978 was also the year of the city&#x27;s silver anniversary, celebrated with three days of events and included the burying of a time capsule to be updated every 25 years.

In 1979, the Florida Air Academy closed, and the land was sold to the Jewish Community Center.

The final home of mobster John Roselli (born 1905), liaison and fixer for the Chicago Outfit in Hollywood, Los Angeles and the Las Vegas Strip was, until June 28, 1976, at his sister Enid and brother-in-law Joseph Daigle&#x27;s residence at 5220 SW 10th Court, and his murdered body was found in a steel drum in Dumfoundling Bay in Miami on August 9.

=== Recent history (1980–present) ===
By 1980, Plantation&#x27;s population had reached 48,653. This year is when the city was first designated as a &#x27;Tree City&#x27; by the Arbor Day Foundation. The Plantation Library was renamed to the Helen B. Hoffman Plantation Library in the following year.

In 1983, the city opened Plantation Central Park: a 77-acre recreation complex, including an Olympic swimming pool, gym, and spaces for softball, football, soccer, tennis, and basketball. The same year, the former Plantation Chamber of Commerce (a 1,000-square-foot office building) was moved over one mile by truck to a new location. The intent was for the building to be used as a museum building by the Plantation Historical Society; however, it was vandalized and fell from its foundation, requiring demolition as a result. Instead, an alternative, Plantation Historical Museum (founded by Genevieve Veltri) is dedicated in June 1985.

The city&#x27;s landscape department established the Plantation Landscaping Award for Nurturing our Town (PLANT) awards in 1984, developed as part of the Tree City USA program to reward outstanding landscaping and maintenance. The same year also saw the first opening of the Plantation Heritage Park to the public.

In 1988, 10 years after the opening of the Broward Mall, two new shopping malls were opened in the city: The Fountains Shopping Mall (450,000 square feet at a cost of $60 million) and the Fashion Mall at Plantation (660,000 square feet, featuring Macy&#x27;s and Lord &amp; Taylor as its anchor stores).

The population reached 66,116 by 1990. The following year, Plantation&#x27;s PLANT awards recognized Marjory Stoneman Douglas (then 100 years of age) as the &quot;First Lady of Conservation&quot; for her efforts to preserve the Everglades.

The insurance company Kemper National Services first opened operations in Plantation in 1993, and in the following year, announced plans to double its office space in the city and hire up to 800 additional employees. At the time, the city&#x27;s largest employers were American Express, followed by Motorola.

During the 100th anniversary of the modern Olympic Games in 1996, the relay run of the Olympic Flame passed through Plantation city center. In September of this year, a fire at the Plantation Towne Mall became the city&#x27;s largest fire to date, impacting 56,000 square feet of the mall. Following the fire, the area was re-built as Plantation Towne Square, including a new Publix as its anchor store.

The year 2000 census established the city population at 82,934, spanning 15 distinct ethnic groups. New city developments around this time included the Volunteer Park Community Center (1999), the Park East Multicultural Garden (2001), the Community Bus Service (2001), Jim Ward Community Center (2002), Jack Carter Harmony Park (2002), Happy Tails Dog Park (2002), the Plantation Equestrian Center (2005), and the Plantation Preserve Golf Course and Club (2006).

Plantation celebrated its 50-year golden anniversary in 2003, with a one-week celebration and updating of the city&#x27;s time capsule.

Hurricane Wilma hit Plantation on Monday, October 24, 2005, causing significant damage and power outages. The resulting damage led to the subsequent closure of the Fashion Mall in 2006.

In 2007, the Broward Mall was acquired by the Westfield Group, received a multimillion-dollar renovation, and was renamed to Westfield Broward.

The city was first named one as of the nation&#x27;s &quot;100 Best Communities for Young People&quot; by America&#x27;s Promise Alliance in 2008. It has won this award on other subsequent years, including 2010 and 2011.

The 2010 census established the city&#x27;s population at 84,955 people. During this year, the vacant former Fashion Mall was planned for auction, but the auction was cancelled after the property owner paid a court judgement.

In 2011, Diane Veltri Bendekovic, daughter of previous long-running mayor Frank Veltri, was elected as mayor of the city.

The city&#x27;s 60th anniversary in 2013 saw the publication of a new book dedicated to its history: &quot;Images of America: Plantation&quot;.

The developers of the previously closed Fashion Mall filed for bankruptcy in October 2014. The property was then sold in a bankruptcy auction in April 2015 for $37.7 million. Demolition of the former Fashion Mall then began in 2016 (leaving the existing hotel, office and parking areas), to make way for Plantation Walk (previously known as 321 North): a $350 million complex including 700 apartments, 200,000 square feet of retail and restaurants, and remodeled versions of the existing 160,000-square-foot office tower and Sheraton hotel. In September 2018, a settlement was reached, dismissing legal conflicts between the area&#x27;s bankruptcy trustee and other parties previously involved in the redevelopment. The development was targeting completion in 2021.

The American Express office in Plantation closed in 2017 when the company moved to a facility in neighboring Sunrise, Florida. In response to the move, committee review began on &#x27;Plantation Midtown&#x27;: a new mixed-use development, encompassing the site of the former American Express office.

On July 6, 2019, 23 people were injured, two seriously, by a gas explosion at the Market on University shopping plaza on South University Drive, which caused extensive damage to it and nearby buildings. The explosion occurred due to People&#x27;s Gas, a division of TECO Energy, failing to close and lock a gas line after a customer request dating back to December 2018, in violation of Federal and Florida law.

In June 2020, following the George Floyd protests some residents called for the city, along with certain local schools whose names include the word &quot;plantation&quot;, to be renamed due to the connotation of the word &quot;plantation&quot; with slavery in the American South. The city&#x27;s name has no direct links to slavery and other residents expressed opposition to renaming.

In 2021, Westfield Mall returned to its previous name of Broward Mall following the fall of the Westfield Group.

=== Malls ===
Plantation was home to two malls, situated across the street from one another: the Westfield Broward Mall (south of Broward Boulevard), and the Fashion Mall (north of Broward Boulevard); however, the Fashion Mall was closed in 2006 and is currently in the process of being re-developed for the Plantation Walk project.

=== Golf and country clubs ===
The oldest club in the city is the 293 acre Fort Lauderdale Country Club, which was first founded in 1926 (despite setbacks caused by the 1926 Miami hurricane). When first opened, the 6,661 yard course was known as the West Side Golf Course, and was owned by the city of Fort Lauderdale; however, the course was renamed in December 1928 when it was leased by Fort Lauderdale. In 1951, the club was expanded with a second 18-hole, 6,915 yard &#x27;North Course&#x27;. Though originally a public club, it became a private club in 1957, when it was sold by the city of Fort Lauderdale. The club&#x27;s original &#x27;South Course&#x27; was designed by Joseph A. Roseman, Hebert Charles Tippet, and George Richardson Sr., and subsequently re-designed by Charles Ankrom (1991) and Kipp Schulties (2006). The North Course was designed by Robert &#x27;Red&#x27; F. Lawrence, then re-designed by Tom Pearson (1999) and Kipp Schulties (2006).

The first club not owned by Fort Lauderdale, the Plantation Golf Course and Country Club, was designed by Robert &#x27;Red&#x27; F. Lawrence and original city master plan architect Russell Pancoast, opening in 1950. Following discovery of a Native American burial mound on the site of the 14th hole during construction, each hole on the course was given a different Native American name to honor the area&#x27;s previous Seminole and Tequesta residents. In addition to the golf course, the club included a swimming pool, tennis courts, and a clubhouse.

Another of the city&#x27;s private golf courses is the 162 acre Lago Mar Country Club (not to be confused with Mar-a-Lago). Established in 1969, Lago Mar was purchased from its original builders in 1980 and re-designed in 2009 by Kipp Schulties, reopening on January 1, 2010. The club includes teeing grounds from 5,811 to 6,756 yards and other facilities such as private tennis courts.

Another public (though privately owned) club within the city is the Jacaranda Golf Club: a 285-acre, 7,247 yard course designed by Mark Mahannah and built 1970, then redesigned by Bobby Weed in 2006.

Work on a new city-owned golf course began in 2002, when the city purchased the property of the original Plantation Golf Course and commenced the new &#x27;Plantation Preserve&#x27; development. This development work resulted in the Plantation Preserve Golf Course and Club: a 214-acre, 7,148 yard course, designed by Robert von Hagge, Michael Smelek, and Rick Baril, which was dedicated in April 2006.

==Education==

According to a 2013–2017 American Community Survey estimate, 93.4% of the city have attained high school graduation or a higher level of education. 25.4% have a bachelor&#x27;s degree, and 17.4% have a graduate or professional degree.

Plantation is part of the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood media market, which is the sixteenth largest media market, the eleventh largest radio market, and the sixteenth largest television market in the United States.

The city&#x27;s primary daily newspapers are the &quot;South Florida Sun-Sentinel&quot; and &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;, and their Spanish-language counterparts &quot;El Sentinel&quot; and &quot;El Nuevo Herald&quot;.

Plantation has also been used as a filming location for feature films, such as &quot;Caddyshack&quot; in 1980 (the Plantation Country Club was used for the film&#x27;s pool scenes), and &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot; in 1998 (the film&#x27;s high school is actually Plantation City Hall, located at 400 NW 73rd Avenue).

<text>Pompano Beach ( ) is a city in Broward County, Florida, United States. It is located along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, just north of Fort Lauderdale and 36 miles north of Miami. The nearby Hillsboro Inlet forms part of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. It is a principal city of the Miami metropolitan area, which was home to 6.14 million people in 2020. As of the 2020 census, the population was 112,046, making it the sixth-largest city in Broward County, the ninth-largest city in the South Florida metropolitan area, and the 20th-largest city in Florida.

Pompano Beach Airpark, located within the city, is the home of the Goodyear Blimp &quot;Spirit of Innovation&quot;.

==History==
Tequesta Indians lived in the area.

The city&#x27;s name is derived from the Florida pompano (&quot;Trachinotus carolinus&quot;), a fish found off the Atlantic coast.

There had been scattered settlers in the area since at least the mid-1880s, but the first documented permanent residents of the Pompano area were George Butler and Frank Sheen and their families, who arrived in 1896 as railway employees. The first train arrived in the small Pompano settlement on February 22, 1896. It is said that Sheen gave the community its name after jotting down on his survey of the area the name of the fish he had for dinner. The coming of the railroad led to development farther west from the coast. In 1906, Pompano became the southernmost settlement in newly created Palm Beach County. That year, the Hillsboro Lighthouse was completed on the beach.

On July 3, 1908, a new municipality was incorporated in what was then Dade County: the Town of Pompano. John R. Mizell was elected the first mayor. In 1915, Broward County was established, with a northern boundary at the Hillsboro Canal. Thus, within eight years, Pompano had been in three counties. Pompano Beach experienced significant growth during the Florida land boom of the 1920s. In 1940, the U.S. Supreme Court disallowed forced confessions in &quot;Chambers v. Florida&quot;, a dispute stemming from a murder in Pompano Beach.

Following the population boom due to World War II, in 1947, the City of Pompano merged with the newly formed municipality on the beach and became the City of Pompano Beach. In 1950, the population of the city reached 5,682. Like most of southeast Florida, Pompano Beach experienced great growth in the late 20th century as many people moved there from northern parts of the United States. A substantial seasonal population also spends its winters in the area. The city of Pompano Beach celebrated its centennial in 2008. It is twinned with West Bromwich in the United Kingdom.

The majority of the initial inhabitants, both African American and white, in this region migrated from northern Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas, while some black residents also came from the Bahamas.

The &quot;Lime Beach&quot; model had staggered roof gables at one end lending a geometric flair to an otherwise rectangular box. The developers marketed the houses nationally, with ads in magazines such as Life.1 Low prices and small down payments enticed many retirees to purchase homes sight unseen via mail.

==Government==
Sea Ranch Lakes has seven village council members and one mayor. All elected officials serve two-year terms. The village was incorporated on October 6, 1959, because residents in the original gated community feared that they would be forcibly annexed by Fort Lauderdale, Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, or Pompano Beach. By incorporating itself as a municipality within Broward County, it can remain indefinitely autonomous. The village is unique in that it owns no property within its municipal borders. All roads, streets, parks, and lakes are private property owned by the Sea Ranch Beach Club. Because all property in the village is private land, the Sea Ranch Lakes Police Department is legally allowed to deny access to residential areas of the village to non-residents through the use of the village&#x27;s main gate.

The Sea Ranch Beach Club owns all property within the village, including the oceanfront property on which the actual beach clubhouse and pool are built. The beach club has members who are elected to serve on its board of directors; they are responsible for maintaining all of the beach club&#x27;s property, such as roads, street lights, and street signs. All major issues that affect the beach club must be voted upon by its members, and all residents of Sea Ranch Lakes are allotted one vote for each parcel of property he/she owns. There are annual membership dues to the Sea Ranch Lakes Beach Club that all residents must pay in addition to their annual property taxes. These membership dues to the beach club are used for capital improvements such as street repaving, painting of the beach club, and salaries of the employees that manage the beach club and maintain its property.

==Public services==

===Police===
Law enforcement services to the village are provided by the Sea Ranch Lakes Police Department, which patrols the walled-in residential section of the village, the oceanfront beach club, and the shopping plaza within the village&#x27;s municipal boundaries. The department has approximately 15 certified police officers and is led by Chief James O&#x27;Brien. Chief O&#x27;Brien retired from the Rochester NY Police Department as a captain and has over 40 years of law enforcement experience. Traditionally the department was staffed by former officers of the New York Police Department. Current members reflect officers from neighboring South Florida agencies as well as former state and federal law enforcement agencies. The department is dispatched by the Broward County Sheriff&#x27;s Office 911 communications and responds as District 26. The department has six (6)patrol vehicles and a minimum of two sworn officers on duty at all times, with a normal weekday staffing of two officers, one police service aide, and the police chief.

The department prides itself on its low crime rate, with the majority offenses occurring within the commercial plaza. In the early 1980s, the department was one of the first in Broward County to have developed a formal hurricane emergency policy. Supplementing uniform patrol efforts, the department has detectives who are responsible for conducting most criminal investigations. The Sea Ranch Lakes Police Department has partnered with area law enforcement agencies through signed Memorandums of Understanding (M.O.U.) to address jurisdictional and/or resource issues that might be associated with any major occurrence. 
The department provides all first responder services and assumes responsibility for such matters as Animal Control and residential security checks. The department renders &quot;Mutual Aid Assistance&quot; to other Law enforcement agencies operating primarily along the coast.

The department sadly has experienced the line of duty death of one of its patrol officers, Sergeant Henry Nelson Adams, in 1975. Sergeant Adams suffered a fatal heart attack while conducting a traffic stop, and died at the age of 50 after having served with the department for four years.

===Fire and medical services===
Fire and emergency medical services to Sea Ranch Lakes are provided by the Pompano Beach Fire Department. The village averages fewer than 100 calls for fire or medical services each year, with many being for services to the shopping plaza or residential fire alarms in the village. The village also averages less than one working structure fire per year. Throughout the history of the village, fire services have varied with each contract. Broward County Fire Rescue, the Lauderdale-by-the-Sea Volunteer Fire Department, and Fort Lauderdale Fire-Rescue have all provided fire suppression services to the village at some point.

The lowest bidder for fire services is usually awarded the four-year contract for services to the village. Before 1996, the Lauderdale-by-the-Sea Volunteer Fire Department served the town, with Fort Lauderdale Fire-Rescue serving until 2001. The Broward County Sheriff&#x27;s Office Department of Fire Rescue &amp; Emergency Services provided fire suppression services to the town from 2001 until 2008. As of October 2008, the Pompano Beach Fire Department provides services after Broward County Sheriff&#x27;s Office closed its station in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea.

===Utilities===
Water services are provided to the town by the Fort Lauderdale Water Department. The residential section of the village has no sewer system, with each resident having an individual septic system. However, the shopping plaza is connected to the Pompano Beach sewer system. Power services are provided to the town by Florida Power &amp; Light, with all residential power lines being buried underground. By having no utility poles inside the village, it is relatively easy to return power to the entire village following a storm, and is also aesthetically pleasing.

===Public works===
The employees of the Sea Ranch Lakes Beach Club are responsible for maintaining all of the villages lakes, parks, streets, and other property.

==Education==
Residents are within the Broward County Public Schools district. It is zoned to McNab Elementary School, Pompano Beach Middle School, and Northeast High School.

<text>Sunrise is a city in central-western Broward County, Florida, United States, and is a principal city of the Miami metropolitan area. The population was 97,335 at the time of the 2020 census.

== History ==

===Early history===
In 1960, Iowa-born developer Norman Johnson paid $9 million for 2,650 acres of land in southwestern Broward County. By 1961, this community of 1.75 square miles—which Johnson named Sunrise Golf Village—had fewer than 350 residents.

It has been reported that the community was to be named Sunset Village—but this did not occur because of objections from residents who felt that &quot;sunset&quot; was too final. Originally called &quot;Sunset,&quot; the name did not sit well with the retirees whom developers wanted to attract, so a change was made to &quot;Sunrise.&quot; Dykstra developed and built an &quot;upside-down house&quot; to lure prospective property buyers. The home was completely furnished, and the carport featured an upside-down automobile. Public interest was aroused through numerous news stories—including a feature in Life magazine. The structure became a national attraction that drew thousands to the Village. People came to stand on the ceiling—and many stayed to make their home in the community.

In 1961, Norman Johnson was appointed by Governor C. Farris Bryant as the first Mayor of Sunrise Golf Village.

According to &quot;City of Sunrise Golf Village,&quot; a booklet produced by the City in 1969: &quot;On January 10, 1967, (a date called for by City Charter) Sunrise Golf Village emerged from a developer&#x27;s operation into a free city under complete control of its residents. Also, on this auspicious date, the City elected a Mayor and seven Councilmen to four-year terms of office. The City of Sunrise Golf Village which comprises 3 1/2 square miles, has no air pollution or drainage problems, all paved streets, and street lighting throughout the entire City.&quot;

That first elected mayor was John Lomelo Jr., a former Miami nightclub owner who was drawn to Sunrise Golf Village by the Upside-Down House.

===Growth===
Originally known as Sunrise Golf Village, the City had a population of 4,300 and comprised just 1.75 square miles by 1967. Then, during the 1970s, as Broward County began to push west, the city experienced its first real growth.

In 1971, the city, by referendum, changed its name to the City of Sunrise. Through annexation, Sunrise eventually expanded to its current boundaries—encompassing more than 18 square miles, reaching the Everglades and dropping south of I-595/State Road 84. The City is situated approximately six miles west of Fort Lauderdale, and is adjoined by the communities of Weston, Davie, Tamarac, Lauderhill, and Plantation.

By October 1984, the city had reached an estimated population of 50,000. In the mid-1980s, growth gave way to challenges, as the City was faced with financial difficulties, limited economic opportunities and a lack of adequate civic amenities. In the early 1990s, Sunrise worked to put its financial house in order, rebuild its infrastructure and establish itself as a center for business headquarters. It is the site of Sawgrass International Corporate Park, which is on a 612-acre lot, the largest corporate park in South Florida.

In 1990, the first phase of Sawgrass Mills opened in Sunrise. Due to its continued popularity and expansion, the shopping and entertainment center has grown to almost 2.3 million square feet. It features 350 outlet and value retailers; food courts and full-service restaurants; movie theater and family entertainment venues.

The National Car Rental Center, now the Amerant Bank Arena, opened in 1998. The arena is the home of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Florida Panthers, and hosts top entertainers and events.

Thanks in large part to these shopping and entertainment destinations, Sunrise has become one of Florida&#x27;s top tourist draws. Its location at the center of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties—in close proximity to the Florida Turnpike and I-95, and bordered by the Sawgrass Expressway, I-75 and I-595—makes Sunrise accessible to area residents and visitors alike.

Sunrise operates its own utility services, including water, wastewater, and natural gas, as well as municipal fire-rescue and police departments. The city also maintains its own system of parks, as well as a soccer club, golf course, tennis club, playgrounds and swimming pools. The Sunrise Civic Center includes a 300-seat theater, an art gallery, an athletic club, and banquet facilities. Sunrise is also home to eleven public schools.

===Google Maps loss incident===
In September 2010, Sunrise was &quot;lost&quot; by Google Maps. Individuals attempting to get driving directions or locate a business in Sunrise were redirected to Sarasota, Florida. This was the third time this occurred in Sunrise&#x27;s history.

===Recent history===

On February 2, 2021, a shootout occurred between a gunman and several FBI agents at an apartment complex in Sunrise. At the time, the agents were serving a federal warrant related to a child exploitation case. Two FBI agents were fatally shot and three others were injured. The gunman, who was the subject of the warrant, was later found dead after barricading himself inside the apartment. The shootout was the most violent incident in the FBI&#x27;s history since the 1986 shootout that left two agents dead and five others injured, and it was also the first time an agent was fatally shot in the line of duty since 2008.

On January 20, 2024, The new City Hall was built. Sunrise City Hall is a modern, five-story, 95,000-square-foot building consolidating most City departments and services. Additional enhancements to the Sunrise municipal complex will include the construction of a new 500-space parking garage, as well as an expanded amphitheater.

<text>Tamarac is a city in Broward County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Miami metropolitan area. At the 2020 census, the city had a population of 71,897.

==History==

In the early 1960s a young developer named Ken Behring came from the Midwest and bought land where he could, creating an active adult community of two-bedroom maintenance-free homes. He called his new city Tamarac, named after the nearby Tamarac Country Club in Oakland Park.

In 1963, Behring built and Jesse Pilch sold the city&#x27;s first development east of State Road 7, Tamarac Lakes Section One and Section Two. Next came homes built on a former orange grove called Tamarac Lakes North and Tamarac Lakes Boulevard. Four of Behring&#x27;s last developments were Tamarac Lakes South, then the Mainlands of Tamarac Lakes just west of State Road 7, and finally the Woodlands community.

The city&#x27;s early leaders, hoping to preserve Tamarac as a bedroom community, allowed Fort Lauderdale to annex commercial pockets, forever losing land that might have bolstered the city&#x27;s coffers. In the late 1970s, the city de-annexed a long line of commercial buildings from State Road 7 all the way to Northwest 31 Avenue, but it went along with Behring&#x27;s vision of Tamarac as a bedroom community. The boundaries were wherever Behring decided to build homes. The city&#x27;s current eastern boundaries narrow to a sliver from Northwest 31 to 37 Avenues, then widen to the south. The city&#x27;s easternmost boundary extends below Commercial Boulevard to Northwest 16 Avenue. City officials had once considered revising their east city limit lines to ensure efficient delivery of government services.

Behring also named a subdivision he built in the Pinellas Park area, the &quot;Mainlands of Tamarac By-the-Gulf&quot;.

<doc id="109087" wikidata="Q990644" url="?curid=109087" title="Weston, Florida">
<text>Weston is a master-planned city in Broward County, Florida, United States. The population was 68,107 at the time of the 2020 census.

Located just west of Fort Lauderdale and to the northwest of Miami, the City of Weston is within the Miami metropolitan area.

== History ==
In the 1950s, industrialist and philanthropist Arthur Vining Davis took control of the approximately which Weston is now located on; Davis was Arvida&#x27;s first owner. In the following years, plans were made to develop the land, and the area which is known as Bonaventure was sold and subsequently developed independently from the Arvida development; this area forms Weston&#x27;s Bonaventure Development District. The large, remaining portion of the master-planned community was developed by Arvida/JMB Realty (known for developing Walt Disney World), and the community was originally named Indian Trace; the area developed by Arvida forms Weston&#x27;s Indian Trace Development District.

The community&#x27;s name of Indian Trace was changed to Weston in the early 1980s, and in 1984, the first homes in the Arvida-developed section of Weston were completed in the Country Isles and Windmill Ranch sections of the community.

In 1994, the Board of Supervisors of Weston began discussing the possibility of either incorporating as a municipality, being annexed into a neighboring municipality, or remaining an unincorporated area of Broward County. In April 1994, the Board of Supervisors initiated an Incorporation Feasibility Study, and a nine-member Steering committee consisting of residents and consultants was established by the Board.

By November 1995, after ruling out remaining an unincorporated area or being annexed to the neighboring municipalities of Davie, Fort Lauderdale, Pembroke Pines, or Sunrise (all four of which received Requests for Proposals on the matter from the Board of Supervisors), it was concluded by both the Board of Supervisors and the Steering Committee that the best option was for Weston to incorporate itself as a city. This was determined to be the best option because the community would be able to govern itself on a local level through home rule, and because the local tax revenues generated by the residents would stay in Weston, remain in Weston&#x27;s control, and be used by and for Weston. Shortly thereafter, the Board of Supervisors formally requested to the State of Florida to let the Indian Trace Development District&#x27;s residents vote on whether or not their district should incorporate as a city.

On May 6, 1996, the State Legislature approved the Local Bill, and a vote on the matter was subsequently scheduled for that summer. Weston ultimately incorporated itself as a city on September 3, 1996. Roughly 90% of the voters in voted in favor of incorporation.

The Bonaventure section was given the choice of becoming a part of Weston or a part of the City of Sunrise, located adjacent to Weston, as part of the Local Bill. On April 1, 1997, by a nearly two-to-one margin, the voters residing in the Bonaventure area voted in favor of becoming part of the City of Weston.

<text>Wilton Manors is a city in Broward County, Florida, United States. Wilton Manors is part of the Miami metropolitan area, which was home to 6,166,488 people at the 2020 census. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 11,426.

== History ==
In the early 20th century, the area now known as Wilton Manors was known as Colohatchee. A train stop along the Florida East Coast Railroad near the current NE 24th Street shared that name. The name Wilton Manors was coined in 1925 by Ned Willingham, a Georgia transplant and land developer. Wilton Manors was incorporated in 1947.

The city is home to a sizable LGBT population and has become a destination for LGBT tourists, who frequent its many nightclubs and gay-owned businesses along the main street, Wilton Drive; the 2010 U.S. Census reported that it is second only to Provincetown, Massachusetts in the proportion (15%) of gay couples relative to the total population. It contains a large Pride Center, the World AIDS Museum and Educational Center, and a branch of the Stonewall National Museum and Archives, whose main facility is in neighboring Fort Lauderdale. A city web page highlights LGBT+ life in Wilton Manors. As of the November 2018 elections, Wilton Manors became the first city in Florida and only the second city in the United States to have an all-LGBT+ governing body.

Since the late 1990s, the Wilton Drive main street corridor has undergone an economic transformation. Formerly a sleepy street lined with small retail shops, Wilton Drive is now the city&#x27;s arts and entertainment district, home to numerous restaurants, bars, shops, condos and rental developments that have blossomed over the last decade. Many of the businesses in the arts and entertainment district are LGBT-owned and/or operated, and &quot;The Drive&quot; has become a local, regional, and national destination for LGBT+ tourism. In late 2018, construction began on a &quot;Complete Streets&quot; project that will see wider sidewalks, on-street parking, buffered bike lines, and the reduction of vehicular lanes from four to two. Construction of the roadway portion of the project is projected to be completed in late 2019, followed by the landscaping portion of the project.

Another example of the economic revitalization in Wilton Manors is the Highland Estates neighborhood, bordered by NE 26th Street on the south, Dixie Highway on the east, the North Fork of the Middle River on the north, and NE 6th Avenue on the west, was significantly transformed in the decade from 1995 to 2005 from a blighted area to an upscale neighborhood with multiple new modern townhouse developments. Citywide real estate prices increased with, and even ahead of, the national trend in the years of the expansion of the housing bubble (2000–2007). In 2007, the city&#x27;s taxable property values had grown to $1.26 billion, according to the Broward County Property Appraiser&#x27;s office. Again following the national trend as the housing bubble burst, Wilton Manors real property taxable values fell 36% from 2007 through 2011. An upward trend in values resumed in 2012 and has continued through the present, with Wilton Manors consistently ranking in the top tier of cities in Broward County with the highest increases in taxable property values. According to the Broward County Property Appraiser, the city&#x27;s 2019 taxable values are approximately $1.48 billion and total assessed market values are just over $2.22 billion.

Wilton Manors is home to several recreational facilities, the largest of which are Hagen Park, Richardson Historic Park and Nature Preserve, and Island City Park Preserve. Other Wilton Manors parks include Donn Eisele Park, Snook Creek Park and Boat Ramp, and Colohatchee Park, a recreational facility complete with a boardwalk for nature observation, a dog park, and a boat ramp for watercraft entry. In addition, there are several pocket parks throughout the city. Another major city park is Mickel Field, which was traditionally a busy hub for local baseball and softball leagues. At the request of the surrounding neighborhood residents, Mickel Field underwent a significant renovation and re-opened in Summer 2015 with new walking trails, fitness station, picnic and performance pavilion, and other new facilities more in tune with the needs of current residents. In 2019, a significant renovation was completed at Colohatchee Park.

=== 2021 Stonewall Pride Parade accident ===
On June 19, 2021, at the start of the Stonewall Pride Parade in Wilton Manors, a member of the Fort Lauderdale Gay Men&#x27;s Chorus lost control of the truck he was driving, which was to be a part of the parade, and drove into other members of his group, killing 75-year-old James Fahy and injuring 2 others, one of whom was put into critical condition, before going on to strike a nearby garden store. The driver, identified as 77-year-old Fred Johnson Jr., narrowly missed U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was seated in a convertible at the time of the accident. The accident caused the parade to be canceled.

==Name==
Blountstown is named for John Blount, a Creek Indian chief who served as a guide for General Andrew Jackson during his invasion of Spanish Florida in 1818. This invasion was not directed at Spain, per se, but at Seminoles who would attack settlements north of Florida, then retreat to relative safety below the border of Spanish Florida. Also, Spain did not return escaped slaves to the U.S. In any case, this invasion caused Spain to sell Florida to the United States, since it was apparent that Spain would have a hard time defending against invasion. Thus, this territory became a part of the U.S. in 1821. The city was officially incorporated in 1903.

The city was without power for almost three weeks and over 80% of homes and businesses were heavily damaged or destroyed.

<text>Englewood is a census-designated place (CDP) in Charlotte and Sarasota counties in the U.S. state of Florida. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 20,800, up from 14,863 at the 2010 census. It is part of the North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Archeological digs in what is now Englewood discovered ceramics belonging to both the Weeden Island culture and Safety Harbor culture.

One of the earliest white settlers in the area was William Goff, who arrived by schooner from Tampa in 1878. He settled a piece of land a few miles south of where Englewood would be platted. On July 3, 1895, a post office was established in the area as well. The Great Freeze of 1894 and 1895, along with a bad freeze in 1896, led to the decimation of many local orange plants. For this reason, by 1897, a Manatee County General Directory listed fish as the chief product for Englewood.

The original plat of Englewood was recorded and filed on August 17, 1896. The home lots were , and the grove lots—likely intended for citrus—were . The area was developed by three brothers, and the name Englewood came from their hometown, Englewood, Chicago. Some streets, such as Dearborn, Harvard, and Yale, are named after those in Chicago. 

In 1898, the Englewood Inn was opened, a relatively large hotel with 16 rooms. The hotel serviced visitors from up north until it burned down in 1909.

Both Sarasota and Charlotte Counties were created in 1921. Englewood was initially more on the Sarasota side of the modern county line; as it expanded, it came to be more equally in both counties.

In 2024, heavy rainfall from Hurricane Helene followed less than two weeks later by storm surge from Hurricane Milton caused extensive damage to Englewood. A number of houses were flooded during Helene and then destroyed during Milton.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 24.99%, is water.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 United States census, Englewood had a population of 20,800 with 10,173 households which resulted in a rate of 1.92 persons per household. 

By age the population was split with 1.2% under 5 years old, 6.3% under 18 years old, and 57.5% 65 years and older. 50.3% of the population were female persons. By race, the population was split with 95.5% white, 0.1% American Indian and Alaska Native, 2.1% Asian, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 1.9% two or more races, and 1.3% Hispanic or Latino. There were 2,626 veterans living in the city and 7.2% of the population were foreign born persons.

The CDP had an owner-occupied housing unit rate of 85.6%. The median value of owner-occupied housing units was $233,800. The median gross rent was $1,068. 93.1% of households had a computer and 84.5% had a broadband internet subscription. 

94.2% of the population 25 years and older were High School graduates or higher and 30.2% of that same population had a Bachelor’s degree or higher.

==Education==
The Englewood Community Redevelopment Area (CRA) is a special district created by the Sarasota County Board of County Commissioners in 1999 on the Sarasota side of Englewood. The Sarasota and Charlotte County School Districts have an interlocal agreement allowing some Charlotte County residents to use the Englewood Elementary School and the Sarasota County students to use the Middle and High School located in Charlotte County. Englewood has a private utility company, the Englewood Water District, and the Englewood Fire District that serve the community.

Englewood contains multiple public elementary schools and one public high school (Lemon Bay High School). Several private schools are also located within Englewood. Englewood Christian Academy, Heritage Christian Academy, and Genesis Christian Academy offer grades K–12. L.A. Ainger Middle School, a public school serving grades 6–8, located in nearby Rotonda West, Florida, is the nearest public middle school.

Popular entertainment includes the beach, restaurants, and a small shopping district located primarily along Dearborn Street.

<doc id="109098" wikidata="Q1022776" url="?curid=109098" title="Port Charlotte, Florida">
<text>Port Charlotte is a census-designated place and unincorporated community in Charlotte County, Florida, United States. The population was 60,625 at the 2020 census, up from 54,392 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Punta Gorda, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area, included in the North Port-Bradenton, Florida Combined Statistical Area.

Port Charlotte was named to the &quot;10 Best Places to Retire&quot;, in the United States for the year 2012 by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

==History==
The Calusa originally settled around the Port Charlotte area. In 1819, Florida was ceded by the Spanish and became a U.S. territory, and in 1845 Florida became the 27th state. For the first 100 years of statehood, the area around Port Charlotte was mostly undeveloped. Maps of the area at the turn of the 20th century show that most of the roads and railroads leading into southwest Florida had bypassed the Port Charlotte area. Aside from some cattle ranches and small farming, the area was mostly uninhabited. This would change when the post-World War II boom opened people&#x27;s eyes to the possibility of developing land in Florida.

In the 1950s, the now defunct General Development Corporation led by the Mackle brothers decided to take advantage of the Florida land boom and developed land primarily on both of Florida&#x27;s coastlines. Among the areas they planned and developed was the Port Charlotte area. Ultimately, Port Charlotte became the most populous community in Charlotte County, although like most GDC developments, Port Charlotte remained an unincorporated community.

Port Charlotte was severely impacted by Hurricane Charley on August 13, 2004. The hurricane, predicted to hit Tampa as a Category 2 hurricane, took a last-minute right hand turn and intensified into a Category 4 storm as it made landfall near Charlotte Harbor and caused severe damage in the city of Punta Gorda and in the Port Charlotte area. The storm&#x27;s maximum sustained winds destroyed almost half of the homes in the county and caused heavy ecological damage to sensitive wetlands in the area.

Just over 18 years later, Port Charlotte was once again severely impacted by a major hurricane, this time Hurricane Ian on September 28, 2022. Ian made landfall as a Category 4 storm in Cayo Costa State Park before moving north-east into Charlotte Harbor, with south-eastern Port Charlotte going through the eye of the storm. Ian caused severe damage to Port Charlotte, mostly wind-related, and to the rest of the surrounding area. Maximum sustained winds of and a wind gust of were reported by a private weather station in Port Charlotte.

<doc id="109100" wikidata="Q1022745" url="?curid=109100" title="Rotonda West, Florida">
<text>Rotonda West is an unincorporated, deed-restricted planned community situated in Charlotte County, Florida, United States. The 2020 U.S. Census Bureau lists it as the Rotonda census-designated place, with a population of 10,114, up from 8,759 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Punta Gorda, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area, included in the North Port-Bradenton, Florida Combined Statistical Area. It was developed and named Rotonda West by Cavanagh Communities Corporation, which purchased the land in 1969.

That developer also bought land for a projected but never developed community named Rotonda East in southern Martin County and northern Palm Beach County. The land selected for that development was swamp land, located north of West Indiantown Road, south of the Tailwinds Airport, west of Interstate 95 and east of Mack Dairy Road. It was not considered wise to drain those wetlands due to changing views on the ecological value of wetlands, and the Army Corps of Engineers refused a permit, so the Rotonda East project was abandoned.

==History==
The land was first part of a large cattle ranch owned by brothers William and Alfred Vanderbilt, direct descendants of Cornelius Vanderbilt. They purchased the land in 1952 and sold a portion in 1969 that became Rotonda West. The development of Rotonda West began in 1970. The layout of Rotonda West mimics temporary World War II airfields in Southern Florida, laid out like a wagon wheel. The choice of the airfield layout as the pattern for Rotonda West gives it a flavor of Florida history, however there was no airfield at this location prior to development, while the format was used at many locations, such as Forman Field NOLF, a training site for new pilots. The circular pattern used a configuration of four paved runways, oriented along the cardinal directions of the compass, along with a circular taxiway running along the outer boundary of the runways. This allowed easier landing maneuvers of student pilots, before having to learn how to make crosswind landings. Forman NOLF is now the location of Nova Southeastern University at Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

The circular nature of Rotonda West was developed after Walt Disney introduced his &quot;City of Tomorrow&quot; called EPCOT on national television October 27, 1966, two months before Disney&#x27;s death.

This area was one of many in Florida hit by Hurricane Ian in September 2022.

==Rotonda Neighborhood layout==

The Rotonda community is laid out into eight segments with a central hub, called the Rotonda Community Park and Preserve, that is a mile and a half circumference. Within the hub there is a playground, tennis courts, and a walking path, while most of the hub is undeveloped. There is also a designated area where people can pay to park boats, trailers, and RVs. There is also a water treatment plant next to the RV &amp; Boat Parking.

The approach was considered modern at the time, inspired by the garden city movement of urban planning, and incorporates a green belt layout throughout the property.

Parade Circle encircles the central hub, while Rotonda Circle and Boundary Boulevard encircle the outer edge. All three of these beltway roads are not contiguous. Rotonda Boulevard connects Parade Circle to Rotonda Circle and Boundary Boulevard, labeled Rotonda Boulevard North, West and East, and link the community to outside neighborhoods and surrounding communities. Rotonda Boulevard South runs along the western edge of Pine Valley and the neighborhood is undeveloped, connecting only to Boundary Boulevard and Rotonda Circle in the south.

Seven of the eight subdivision segments have neighborhood names; Oakland Hills, Pebble Beach, Pinehurst, Broadmoor, Long Meadow, White Marsh and Pine Valley. There is one segment that is undeveloped between Oakland Hills, which is the oldest, and Pine Valley in the southwest segment, which was to be called Saint Andrews, but due to wetlands conservation efforts, was not established. All but one segment, Broadmoor, incorporate a golf course between the houses, and Oakland Hills, Pinehurst, Long Meadow, and Pine Valley share a common street layout, while Pebble Beach, Broadmoor, and White Marsh incorporate cul-de-sac street layouts. The five golf courses are called Pinemoor, The Palms, The Hills, The Links and the Long Marsh, which offers 27 holes to play that are integrated into the White Marsh and Pine Valley subdivisions, while the others offer 18. Broadmoor neighborhood has twelve interconnected ponds for shallow watercraft, while the other neighborhoods have shallow canals that are linked to the other segments, and pass underneath bridges on Rotonda Boulevard and Rotonda Circle. Residents of Pine Valley do not have an inner connecting road to Parade Circle, while the other neighborhoods do, and the outer boundary roads, and don&#x27;t connect Oakland Hills and Pine Valley in the southwest.

All of the homes are single-family bungalows with an attached garage, and there are no multi-family dwellings or shopping centers within the campus.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Rotonda CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 7.74%, is water.

==Celebrity endorsement and promotion==

In 1972, the original developer Cavanagh Communities Corporation promoted available sites for sale on the &quot;Superstars&quot; sports competition show on ABC-TV in February 1973. Later Ed McMahon was a paid spokesman for the property, and advertised the community at national events, later becoming Vice President of Cavanagh Corporation. He was given a house with close proximity to a golf course at 37 Golfview Rd in the Oakland Hills neighborhood, which was used for entertaining celebrities at the Superstars competitions.

<text>Beverly Hills is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Citrus County, Florida, United States. The population was 9,961 at the 2020 census, up from 8,445 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Homosassa Springs, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Sam Kellner, a Jewish businessman from New York, made a fortune in the tire business during the 1930s and 1940s, after which he went into construction and real estate development. Around 1960 he purchased 3,500 acres of land in interior Citrus County. Within a few years, Kellner began to develop the former cattle land, selling simple, single-story homes to retirees from the urban North, especially New York and Detroit. Kellner named his new venture Beverly Hills.

Beverly Hills was among the first retirement-oriented planned communities in Central Florida. Like other such developments in South Florida and the Tampa-St. Petersburg area, a private company—Kellner’s Rolling Oaks Corporation—owned most of the non-residential property, including a nearby lumberyard and concrete plant. Purchasing land in a rural, inland area allowed Kellner to market the new community to working class retirees at affordable prices. Beverly Hills proved an early success, growing from 20 homes in the spring of 1962 to around 400 by the end of 1965. In 1972, the development’s population reached 4,500 residents living in 2,200 homes.

In 1980, Beverly Hills Development Corp. purchased the subdivision from original developer Sam Kellner in 1980 and nine years later it was sold to Morrison Homes, the Atlanta-based home builder which ceased selling homes in the subdivision in 1999.

==History==
Citrus Springs was developed by the Mackle Brothers, prominent Florida real estate developers working under The Deltona Corporation to be used as a subdivision consisting of over 34,000 homesites. (Elkcam Boulevard, a prominent street in Citrus Springs, is &quot;Mackle&quot; spelled backwards.) The area currently has two elementary schools (Citrus Springs Elementary School and Central Ridge Elementary School, opened fall 2008) and one middle school (Citrus Springs Middle School). There are plans for an high school campus complete with public park, but construction is not planned in the near future.

Phosphate mining played a major part in the history of Citrus County until the end of World War II, when phosphate mining largely moved overseas. The first newspaper of Citrus County was called the &quot;Phosphate Times&quot;. Many abandoned mines exist in the Withlacoochee River basin, with a concentration of those within Citrus Springs. Some of those areas can be seen at one of Citrus Springs&#x27; two golf courses, El Diablo. Many of those mines were part of the Dunnellon Phosphate company, headed by Capt John L. Inglis, a veteran of the Civil War. Areas in northeastern Citrus Springs were part of a proposed but unbuilt portion of the Cross Florida Barge Canal to aid the transportation of the mineral.

The Withlacoochee State Trail, a bike riding trail which was converted from the railroad lines built in the early 1900s, runs through Citrus Springs, in places parallel to US 41.

==Education==
The CDP is served by Citrus County Schools. Residents are divided between Citrus Springs Elementary and Central Ridge Elementary. All residents are zoned to Citrus Springs Middle School. Portions of the CDP are zoned to Citrus High School, Crystal River High School, and Lecanto High School.

<text>Homosassa () is a census-designated place (CDP) in Citrus County, Florida, United States. The population was 2,299 at the 2020 census, down from 2,578 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Homosassa Springs, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Homosassa is derived from a Seminole Indian name meaning either &quot;river of fishes&quot; or &quot;pepper ridge&quot;.

In 1851, David Levy Yulee established a sugar plantation on the Homosassa River, close to the current town of Homosassa. The plantation was worked by approximately 1,000 slaves, but Yulee was an absentee owner, spending most of his time in Fernandina. Among the crops raised were sugar cane, cotton, and citrus. The Yulee Groves were one of the first in Florida to grow sweet oranges budded from sour orange stock. The mill, which was steam-driven, operated from 1851 to 1864 and produced sugar, syrup, and molasses, the last of which was part of the rum-making process. After the Civil War ended in 1865, Yulee was imprisoned, the slaves were freed, and the site was abandoned. The remains of the plantation are preserved at the Yulee Sugar Mill Ruins Historic State Park.

==Wildlife==
Homosassa is home to Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park, which is often home to large numbers of &quot;migratory&quot; manatees, which frequent the area due to its springs and relatively warm waters. The park has been known to have Florida panthers, black bears, red wolves, alligators and flamingos. The park is home to Lu, a famous hippopotamus known for his performances in many movies. The park also hosts an underwater viewing platform, known as the &quot;fish bowl&quot;, where visitors can see manatees and fish swimming in the large spring from which the Homosassa River begins. The Wildlife Park helps spread awareness about the dangers of boating around areas inhabited by manatees as well as the destructive effects of polluting the environment. The park is one of the few major attractions of the area, which has a large retiree population and a very low level of activity compared to major tourist regions of Florida. The Homosassa and Halls rivers run through the area, and it is fairly common to see manatees surface near the area&#x27;s waterfront restaurants and bars.

Homosassa is considered one of the best places in the world to catch Atlantic tarpon.

<doc id="109110" wikidata="Q743247" url="?curid=109110" title="Inverness, Florida">
<text>Inverness is a city and the county seat of Citrus County, Florida, United States. It is near the Flying Eagle Preserve. As of the 2020 census, the population was 7,543, up from 7,210 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Homosassa Springs, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. 
== History ==
Archaeological digs showed that the Seminole resided in the area that is now Inverness. The Seminole leader Osceola made his wartime camp, known as Powell&#x27;s Town, in the area during the Second Seminole War. During the Second Seminole War, the nearby Fort Cooper was besieged by Osceola and his band of warriors. The garrison was just about out of food when it was relieved by a column of troops under Gen. Duncan L. Clinch.

The city of Inverness was originally named &quot;Tompkinsville&quot;. A white settlement of the area dates back to 1868. Tompkins, later known as &quot;Uncle Alf&quot;, started the community. To attract newcomers to the town, he established a mail service and helped erect the first sawmill in the county. He gave his brother-in-law, Frank M. Dampier Sr., a lot to build a store, with Dampier becoming the first merchant in town. Dampier is credited with laying out the town and naming it Tompkinsville.

Not many years later, the town of Tompkinsville was sold to a firm in Jacksonville, and the name was changed to &quot;Inverness&quot;. According to the late historian Mary McRae of Homosassa, Inverness is named directly after a Scottish city of the same name. Inverness is Great Britain&#x27;s most northerly city, and &quot;the capital of the Highlands&quot;, with a population of 46,870. The story goes that Inverness, Florida, got its name from a lonely Scotsman, far away from his home, who gazed upon the blue waters of the Native American-named Tsala Apopka Lake and thought the area looked like the headlands and lochs of the area surrounding Inverness, Scotland. &quot;Inver&quot; is a Gaelic word meaning &quot;mouth of the river&quot;, the River Ness flows through the Scottish city Inverness, so Inverness literally means the mouth of the River Ness, which flows from Loch Ness, which is one of Scotland&#x27;s most visited areas. Since the Florida city lies at the foot of one of the chain of lakes in Citrus County, Inverness seemed an appropriate name.

According to official city documentation, Inverness was incorporated on March 6, 1919.

Over twelve downtown buildings have been recognized by the historic plaque program and are presently active places for business. Central Business Development grants have helped to retain the historic character of the city. In 1961, the historic courthouse downtown was used to film the courtroom scene of &quot;Follow That Dream&quot;, featuring Elvis Presley.

The city has been designated a &quot;Gateway Community&quot; by the Florida Trail Association. Since 1995, Inverness has been recognized as a Tree City USA by the National Arbor Day Foundation and the US Forest Service. In 2009, Inverness was named &quot;City of the Year&quot; by the Forty and Eight, a national veterans&#x27; organization.

==Geography==
Inverness is located in eastern Citrus County, on the western shore of the connected Tsala Apopka and Henderson lakes. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.01%, is water. Within the city are of land reserved for passive and active park usage.

Inverness Airport is located south of the city limits, next to the Citrus County Speedway. The Citrus County Sheriff&#x27;s Office&#x27;s aviation unit operates from this airport.

U.S. Route 41 is the main north-south road through Inverness, leading north to Dunnellon and south to Brooksville. The main east-west road is State Road 44, leading west to Crystal River and east to Interstate 75 near Wildwood. The two roads join to form Inverness&#x27; Main Street from Talmage Avenue to Highland Boulevard. Other county roads include County Road 581 and County Road 470.
Inverness is home to the Lakes Region Library, which is part of the Citrus County Library System. The library offers several recreational classes such as Tai Chi, painting, gardening, basic technology usage, children and teen programs, and more.

The Withlacoochee State Trail, which replaced a former Atlantic Coast Line Railroad line, runs between two of the chained lakes, with small bridges replacing former railroad trestle crossings. The trail offers access to 46 continuous miles of enjoyment for biking, jogging and walking. It is the longest paved recreation trail in Florida. The Inverness trailhead can be found on North Apopka Avenue (CR 470) across from the trail crossing and Liberty Park.

Other parks in Inverness include Wallace Brooks Park, Whispering Pines Park, the Henderson Lake boat ramps, and Fort Cooper State Park, just south of the city. Inverness is also close to Withlapopka Community Park, the almost Flying Eagle Preserve and the almost McGregor Smith Scout Reservation.
==Government==
Inverness utilizes a council–manager form of government with a city council composed of the mayor of Inverness and five councilmembers. This council also sets policy to be administered, directed, and implemented by the city manager. As of February 2020, the current mayor is Bob Plaisted and the current city manager is Eric Williams.

==Education==
The city is served by Citrus County Schools. Residents are divided between Inverness Primary, Pleasant Grove Elementary, and Hernando Elementary. All residents are zoned to Inverness Middle School, and Citrus High School.

The Lakes Region Library of Citrus Libraries is in Inverness.

==Events==
The last full weekend in October is reserved for the Great American Cooter Festival, named after the Florida cooter turtle. A family-focused event of music, games, crafts and more is held at the adjoining Liberty and Wallace Brooks parks on Lake Henderson. In 2022, the event was replaced by the Inverness Country Jam.

Since 1971, the first weekend in November marks the Festival of the Arts, a juried fine art show that has grown to include over 100 artists.

Every year in March, there is a Seminole War re-enactment at Fort Cooper State Park called Fort Cooper Days.

==History==
The name is derived from the Yulee Sugar Mill Ruins in nearby Homosassa.

The settlement was platted in 1972, with a concept of six villages: Cypress, Oak, Pinewood, Palm, Orange, and Meadow Run — each with its own village center. 24,000 lots were planned. The first nine holes of Sugarmill Woods Country Club&#x27;s golf course, two tennis courts, and a swimming pool were completed in 1975.

Amenities included golf courses, and swim and tennis complexes.

==Geography==
Sugarmill Woods is located in southern Citrus County. It is bordered to the north by Homosassa Springs and Lecanto, to the south by Hernando County, to the west by US Highways 19/98 (Suncoast Boulevard), and the east by the Suncoast Parkway Extension (SR 589 Tollway) traversing the Withlacoochee State Forest. According to the United States Census Bureau, the Sugarmill Woods CDP has a total area of , mostly land, with the exception of several retention ponds.

==Demographics==

It is important to note that the CDP&#x27;s demography is subject to seasonal migratory owners and their preferred registry locations. The CDP&#x27;s occupancy increases significantly November through April.

Citrus County currently has plans for a MUP along US HWY 98 from the south-side intersection with Oak Village Boulevard, to the US HWY 98 trailhead.

==Government==

In Cypress Village, elected board directors are permitted to serve two consecutive 3-year terms without a maximum number of terms, while committee members serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors by invitation, and without term limits.

<text>Green Cove Springs is a city in and the county seat of Clay County, Florida, United States. Green Cove Springs is a part of the Jacksonville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 9,786 at the 2020 census, up from 6,908 at the 2010 census.

The city is named after the portion of the St. Johns River upon which it is built. The river bends here, and the area is sheltered by trees that are perennially green.

== History ==
The area was first inhabited over 7,000 years ago by Native Americans attracted to a warm mineral spring. The hydrological spring, locally known as the &quot;Original Fountain of Youth&quot;, attracted patrons in the 19th century to the spa town, where more than a dozen hotels were built near the spring to accommodate them. Today, the sulfur-scented spring water feeds an adjacent public swimming pool before flowing the short distance to the St. Johns River. The Green Cove Springs area was first developed by George J. F. Clarke in 1816 when he was provided land, under a Spanish land grant, to build a sawmill. Green Cove Springs was established in 1854 as White Sulfur Springs. Renamed in 1866, it became the Clay County seat in 1871.
Agriculture and tourism were the two primary economic activities in the area until the end of the 19th century, when Henry Flagler&#x27;s railroad began taking tourists further south in Florida. In 1895, the Great Freeze destroyed the area&#x27;s citrus crops, and tourism all but ended. The 1920s had renewed development, with automobile traffic once again bringing in tourists. The Great Depression of the 1930s marked the end of this period of growth for the city.
The first women&#x27;s club in the state of Florida was established in Green Cove Springs in 1883. The Village Improvement Association led local efforts to beautify the town, and established its first public library.

The period immediately before and during World War II again brought new growth to Green Cove Springs. On September 11, 1940, the U.S. Navy opened Naval Air Station Lee Field in honor of Ensign Bejamin Lee, who had lost his life in a crash at Killinghome, England, during World War I. In August 1943, the facility was renamed Naval Air Station Green Cove Springs and consisted of four asphalt runways. One of the Marine Corps aviators training in the F4U Corsair Operational Training Unit at Lee Field in early 1945 was eventual television personality Ed McMahon. After the war, NAS Green Cove Springs was downgraded in status to a Naval Auxiliary Air Station (NAAS) as part of the greater NAS Jacksonville complex. Thirteen piers were constructed along the west bank of the St. Johns River adjacent to NAAS Green Cove Springs to house a U.S. Navy Atlantic Reserve Fleet, Florida &quot;mothball fleet&quot; of some 500 vessels, primarily destroyers, destroyer escorts, and fleet auxiliaries. In 1960, the Navy decommissioned NAAS Green Cove Springs and the pier facility. Some of the mothballed vessels were transferred to foreign navies, while others were relocated to other Reserve Fleet locations.
In 1984, the city annexed the former naval base into the city to use it for further growth and development as the Clay County Port and Reynolds Industrial Park. The air station is now a private airfield known as Reynolds Airpark (FAA airfield identifier FL60) with a single asphalt runway currently operational, although reportedly in poor condition. Though the original air traffic control tower is still standing, attached to one of the former Navy aircraft hangars, the airfield remains an uncontrolled facility.

Green Cove Springs is the birthplace of Charles E. Merrill (1885–1956), one of the founders of Merrill Lynch. The town&#x27;s spring is described by his son James Merrill in the poem &quot;Two From Florida&quot;, published in &quot;The Inner Room&quot; (1988).

Green Cove Springs is also the birthplace of Augusta Savage (née Augusta Christine Fells, February 29, 1892 – March 26, 1962). Savage was an African-American sculptor associated with the Harlem Renaissance.

Locally, the community is known as the home of Gustafson&#x27;s Farm, a brand name of milk and dairy products sold throughout Florida. The main Gustafson Dairy Farm is located in Green Cove Springs and is one of the largest privately owned dairy farms in the Southeastern United States. Started in 1908, the main farm occupies nearly adjacent to the city limits. Gustafson&#x27;s has many bottling plants across the state, stretching from Tallahassee in the west to Tampa and Cocoa in the south. All Gustafson products have the picture of the husband-and-wife founders, Frank and Agnes Gustafson (also known as Mama and Papa Gus), who along with their first cow on their farm (named &quot;Buttercup&quot;) are prominently featured on the packaging of the dairy&#x27;s products.

Scenes for the 1971 &quot;B&quot; monster movie &quot;Blood Waters of Dr. Z&quot; (or &quot;Zaat&quot;) were filmed here. The movie was satirized on the television program &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

The Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center, one of ten regional centers for primate research, was once located just west of Orange Park in what is now the Lakeside CDP. The center, established in 1930 by psychologist Robert Yerkes and Yale University and the Rockefeller Foundation, was the first laboratory in the United States for the study of non-human primates. Prior to the opening of the facility, Yerkes was engaged in his own research with two great apes, named &quot;Chim&quot; and &quot;Panzee&quot;. His findings convinced officials at Yale University, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation to sponsor the Florida facility. Initially designed to house about 25 chimpanzees, researchers worked with an estimated 65 chimps (and possibly more) during the lab&#x27;s 35-year history. This location was home to chimpanzees nurtured as humans such as Gua and Viki and other primates from the estate of Madame Rosalia Abreu in Havana, Cuba. It was home to some of the leading behavioral scientists of the time, some of whom either liked or hated living in the humid South. These researchers studied various aspects of primate behavior, including basic biology, sensory function, reproductive systems, behavioral patterns, physiology and anatomy. Comically, rumors about the place by some Orange Park residents included those of scientists cross-breeding humans with apes. The term &quot;Monkey Farm&quot; has been used by some residents, who may be aware of the location&#x27;s history, to describe the lab&#x27;s functions.

The plot of land upon which Yerkes Labs sat was , about a mile west of Orange Park. The actual research buildings sat on less than an acre, on what is now part of the Foxwood Center plaza (facing Orange Park Medical Center on Kingsley Avenue) in unincorporated land outside the town limits. In 1966, the abandoned buildings and adjacent land were purchased by Developer Marvin Wilhite of Ahpla, Inc., who still lives in Foxwood and built other communities such as Foxridge. He chose the name Ahpla (using a backward arrangement of the letters) after a female chimp named Alpha, who was the first chimp born at the Yerkes Labs on September 11, 1930.

Foxwood Center still has some of the original laboratory buildings that once housed the chimps, the grounds caretaker, and administrative offices. These stand alongside others that have been added, including the Orange Park Chamber of Commerce building. The old caretaker&#x27;s house is now known as The Granary, an organic food and health store.

In 1956, Emory University took over operation of the Center. In 1965, the center was relocated to the campus of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2002, the Center was renamed the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, though officially the &quot;Regional&quot; name still applies.

<doc id="109119" wikidata="Q2271504" url="?curid=109119" title="Middleburg, Florida">
<text>Middleburg is an unincorporated area and census-designated place (CDP) within Clay County in the U.S. state of Florida, located southwest of downtown Jacksonville and northwest of Green Cove Springs, the county seat of Clay County. As of the 2020 census, the population of Middleburg was 12,881, down from 13,008 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Jacksonville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

It is home to Middleburg High School and to the Middleburg Historic District.

==Geography==
Middleburg is located northwest of the center of Clay County at (30.050783, -81.902013). Florida State Road Blanding Boulevard leads northeast to the Orange Park area and southwest to Keystone Heights.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Middleburg CDP has a total area of , all land.

==History==
===Early settlement===
It was first settled as a village in the early decades of the nineteenth century. Asa Clark ran the first ferry on Black Creek until 1828, leading to the settlement being called &quot;Clark&#x27;s Ferry&quot;.

Between 1824 and 1827, the Federal Military Road was constructed, running south from Colerain, Georgia to Tampa Bay. The road passed through Clark&#x27;s Ferry along the route of present-day Main Street, resulting in increased traffic through the community and providing a postal route.

Blakey (1976) wrote of a settlement called Whitesville which existed approximately near the intersection of present-day Florida State Road 21 and County Road 218, and which grew large enough to warrant its own United States Post Office, established on February 19, 1828. That same year, Isaac Boring founded the Black Creek Methodist Church, although the frontier Methodist society met in their own homes until the Methodist Church was built in 1847.

John Hanson took ownership of Clark&#x27;s ferry from 1828 through 1833, whereafter he sold to Samuel and Charlotte Garey, resulting in the area coming to be known as &quot;Garey&#x27;s Ferry&quot;. George Branning also operated a separate ferry, which competed with Garey&#x27;s, around this time.

===Forts Heileman and Sanderson===
The community expanded rapidly during the Second Seminole War. Fort Heileman, a wooden stockade fortification located between the North and South prongs of Black Creek, was hastily built in 1836 and protected settlers at Garey&#x27;s Ferry where it was the &quot;principal depot for the east coast of Florida.&quot;

During the Seminole Wars, Fort Heileman was used as a quartermaster workshop and storage depot until its armaments were moved to Fort Shannon in Palatka and the fort was largely abandoned after June 18, 1841. The fort was permanently abandoned in 1842 and destroyed by a flood later that year. The only potential remnant of Fort Heileman is the Clark-Chalker House, which was built in 1835 and may have served as Fort Heileman&#x27;s army hospital.

Fort Sanderson was constructed in July 1840 to be used for storage; both forts were abandoned the following year, and destroyed in a hurricane in 1842.

===Creation of Middleburgh, Seat of Clay County===
Garey&#x27;s Ferry expanded following the Seminole Wars, growing quickly and trading in timber, citrus fruits, cotton, and farm crops. In 1851, Garey&#x27;s Ferry and Whitesville were consolidated into the town of Middleburgh, and the post office moved from Whitesville to its current location on Palmetto Street. Clay County (named for Henry Clay) was created from Duval County in December 1858, and Middleburgh became and remained the county seat until 1874.

Throughout the 1850s, as national tensions leading to the American Civil War were increasing, Middleburgh and Clay County remained a stronghold of Whig voters and pro-Union sentiment; in 1859, Whitesville residents renamed their community &quot;Webster&quot; in honor of Whig politician Daniel Webster.

===American Civil War===
On October 23, 1864, during the American Civil War, the 4th Massachusetts Volunteer Cavalry engaged local Confederates in a skirmish from their base at the Magnolia Springs hotel. Moving into Middleburg the next day, October 24, 1864, the 4th Massachusetts raided and set fire to downtown Middleburg on Main Street and Thompson (now Wharf) Street, destroying Samuel B. Thompson&#x27;s cotton warehouses and docks, as well as a hotel. The 2nd Florida Cavalry, under command of Captain J.J. Dickison, retaliated by firing on the Massachusetts regiment, leading the latter to retreat across Black Creek and burn the ferry bridge behind them. As the Massachusetts regiment rushed back to Magnolia Springs, Dickison&#x27;s regiment detoured four miles through Whitesville and caught the Massachusetts regiment at Jeremiah Halsey&#x27;s Plantation, engaging in a skirmish that resulted in twelve Union deaths and Confederate victory. This skirmish is known officially as the Battle of Halsey&#x27;s Plantation, but has also been referred to as the Battle of Big Gum Creek. The exact location of Halsey&#x27;s Plantation is not known, but it was near the site that is currently Shadowlawn Elementary School on County Road 218.

Among the repeated skirmishes between the 4th Massachusetts and 2nd Florida cavalries was a two-hour engagement in which Dickison&#x27;s troops rescued cattle that had been seized by Union troops, which local history refers to as the Battle of the Tiger Head.

===Decline and expansion===
Middleburg suffered from the Civil War, after which there were less than 100 residents. Middleburg&#x27;s population numbered in the 700s between 1890 and 1920. The Great Freeze of 1895 in and a reduction of the river trade further contributed to the town&#x27;s decline.

In the 1890s, African American homesteaders, starting with Grant Forman (1868-1951) in 1895, settled and developed the community of Hill Top in what is Forman Circle.&quot; According to &quot;Embedded in Clay,&quot; Forman fled to South Carolina after his house was burned by a white mob. Frosard Budington, a leader of Whitesville, covered the cost of Forman&#x27;s land taxes until such time as it was safe for Forman to return to Hill Top.

The 1989 film &quot;Brenda Starr&quot; was partially filmed on Black Creek.

Since the 1990s, Middleburg&#x27;s population and industry have rapidly expanded along with the surrounding communities of Orange Park, Lakeside, Lake Asbury, Fleming Island, and Jacksonville. Because of this development, construction to extend the First Coast Expressway through the area is underway, including the addition of exit junctions in Middleburg, Green Cove Springs, and Asbury Lake.

<text>Orange Park is a town in Clay County, Florida, United States. As a suburb of Jacksonville in neighboring Duval County, it is formally a part of the Jacksonville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 9,089 at the 2020 census, up from 8,412 from the 2010 census. while the Town of Orange Park is only 5.32 sq mi large, Orange Park is the designated city on all addresses for all homes and businesses within the 32073 ZIP code, which includes Lakeside, Bellair-Meadowbrook Terrace and Oakleaf Plantation.

The town&#x27;s name reflects the hope of its founders for a fruit-growing industry, but their crops were destroyed in the Great Freeze of 1894–1895. Despite recovery elsewhere, the crops never came back to Orange Park.

== History ==
Orange Park in the late 18th century was known simply as Laurel Grove. The name Laurel Grove comes from Sarah and William Pengree, who received a land grant from the Spanish governor. Laurel Grove was sold to Zephaniah Kingsley, of the Kingsley Plantation, upon William&#x27;s death. Zephaniah developed Laurel Grove into a model farming plantation for over 10 years. In 1813, General Matthews invaded East Florida, triggering the Patriots&#x27; Rebellion. After Mathews left East Florida, Zephaniah&#x27;s wife, Anna Madgigine Jai Kingsley, burned down Laurel Grove to keep it out of Patriots&#x27; hands.

The Town of Orange Park was founded, in 1877, by the Florida Winter Home and Improvement Company. After the Civil War, the company bought several thousand acres of the McIntosh plantation at Laurel Grove, for the purpose of creating a southern retreat and small farming community. The property was divided into building lots and small farm tracts, division that involved laying out the present street system, including Kingsley Avenue and Plainfield Avenue. The town was incorporated in 1879 by a special act of the Florida Legislature. In January 1880, Ulysses S. Grant and Philip Sheridan visited Orange Park. A large hotel was built at Kingsley Avenue along with a 1,200-foot pier. In 1895, the local fruit-growing industry was destroyed in the Great Freeze of 1895.

In October 1891, the Orange Park Normal &amp; Industrial School was opened. The school was founded by the American Missionary Association and allowed for both black and white students to attend, the only unsegragated school in Florida at the time. However, by the end of 1913, the school was closed due to Jim Crow laws.

In 1922, the Loyal Order of Moose, a fraternal organization, bought the former Hotel Marion in downtown Orange Park and rebuilt the property into Moosehaven, a 63-acre retirement community that is exclusively for its senior members.

Orange Park Elementary School, built in 1927, continues to operate a few blocks from the river. It is near Moose Haven, in the River Road Historic District, a stretch of road parallel to the Saint Johns River and dotted with century-old trees, where many locals come to walk and jog in the afternoon. About a quarter of a mile away is Club Continental, previously called Mira Rio. Mira Rio, whose name was Spanish for &quot;River Watch&quot;, was the winter palazzo of Caleb Johnson, son of the founder of the Palmolive Soap Company, now the billion-dollar Colgate-Palmolive company.

In 1930, Robert Yerkes, with the support of Yale University, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Carnegie Foundation, established a research station in Orange Park to study primate biology and behavior. Originally called the Yale Laboratories for Primate Biology, it was renamed the Yerkes Laboratory of Primate Biology after Yerkes retired in 1941. In 1956, ownership of the laboratory was transferred to Emory University. The laboratory became the Yerkes National Primate Research Center; it was moved to the Emory University campus in Georgia in 1965.

<doc id="109122" wikidata="Q176011" url="?curid=109122" title="Darlington transistor">
<text>In electronics, a Darlington configuration (commonly called as a Darlington pair) is a circuit consisting of two bipolar transistors with the emitter of one transistor connected to the base of the other, such that the current amplified by the first transistor is amplified further by the second one. The collectors of both transistors are connected together. This configuration has a much higher current gain than each transistor taken separately. It acts like and is often packaged as a single transistor. It was invented in 1953 by Sidney Darlington.

== Behavior ==
A Darlington pair behaves like a single transistor, meaning it has one base, collector, and emitter. It typically creates a high current gain (approximately the product of the gains of the two transistors, because their β values multiply together). A general relation between the compound current gain and the individual gains is given by:

:formula_1

If &quot;β1&quot; and &quot;β2&quot; are high enough (hundreds), this relation can be approximated with:

:formula_2

A typical Darlington transistor has a current gain of 1000 or more, so that only a small base current is needed to make the pair switch on much higher switched currents. Another advantage involves providing a very high input impedance for the circuit which also translates into an equal decrease in output impedance. The ease of creating this circuit also provides an advantage. It can be simply made with two separate NPN (or PNP) transistors, and is also available in a variety of single packages.

One drawback is an approximate doubling of the base–emitter voltage. Since there are two junctions between the base and emitter of the Darlington transistor, the equivalent base–emitter voltage is the sum of both base–emitter voltages:

:formula_3

For silicon-based technology, where each VBEi is about 0.65 V when the device is operating in the active or saturated region, the necessary base–emitter voltage of the pair is 1.3 V.

Another drawback of the Darlington pair is its increased &quot;saturation&quot; voltage. The output transistor is not allowed to saturate (i.e. its base–collector junction must remain reverse-biased) because the first transistor, when saturated, establishes full (100%) parallel negative feedback between the collector and the base of the second transistor. Since collector–emitter voltage is equal to the sum of its own base–emitter voltage and the collector-emitter voltage of the first transistor, both positive quantities in normal operation, it always exceeds the base-emitter voltage. (In symbols, formula_4 always.) Thus the &quot;saturation&quot; voltage of a Darlington transistor is one VBE (about 0.65 V in silicon) higher than a single transistor saturation voltage, which is typically 0.1 - 0.2 V in silicon. For equal collector currents, this drawback translates to an increase in the dissipated power for the Darlington transistor over a single transistor. The increased low output level can cause troubles when TTL logic circuits are driven.

Another problem is a reduction in switching speed or response, because the first transistor cannot actively inhibit the base current of the second one, making the device slow to switch off. To alleviate this, the second transistor often has a resistor of a few hundred ohms connected between its base and emitter terminals. This resistor provides a low-impedance discharge path for the charge accumulated on the base-emitter junction, allowing a faster transistor turn-off.

The Darlington pair has more phase shift at high frequencies than a single transistor and hence can more easily become unstable with negative feedback (i.e., systems that use this configuration can have poor performance due to the extra transistor delay).

==Packaging==
Darlington pairs are available as integrated packages or can be made from two discrete transistors; Q1, the left-hand transistor in the diagram, can be a low power type, but normally Q2 (on the right) will need to be high power. The maximum collector current IC(max) of the pair is that of Q2. A typical integrated power device is the 2N6282, which includes a switch-off resistor and has a current gain of 2400 at IC=10 A.

Integrated devices can take less space than two individual transistors because they can use a &quot;shared&quot; collector. Integrated Darlington pairs come packaged singly in transistor-like packages or as an array of devices (usually eight) in an integrated circuit.

==Darlington triplet==
A third transistor can be added to a Darlington pair to give even higher current gain, making a Darlington triplet. The emitter of the second transistor in the pair is connected to the base of the third, as the emitter of first transistor is connected to the base of the second, and the collectors of all three transistors are connected together. This gives current gain approximately equal to the product of the gains of the three transistors. However the increased current gain often does not justify the sensitivity and saturation current problems, so this circuit is seldom used.

== Applications ==

Darlington pairs are often used in the push-pull output stages of the power audio amplifiers that drive most sound systems. In a fully symmetrical push-pull circuit two Darlington pairs are connected as emitter followers driving the output from the positive and negative supply: an NPN Darlington pair connected to the positive rail providing current for positive excursions of the output, and a PNP Darlington pair connected to the negative rail providing current for negative excursions.

Before good quality PNP power transistors were available, the quasi-symmetrical push-pull circuit was used, in which only the two transistors connected to the positive supply rail were an NPN Darlington pair, and the pair from the negative rail were two more NPN transistors connected as common-emitter amplifiers.

A Darlington pair can be sensitive enough to respond to the current passed by skin contact even at safe zone voltages. Thus it can form a new input stage of a touch-sensitive switch.

Darlington transistors can be used in high-current circuits such as the LM1084 voltage regulator. Other high-current applications could include those involving computer control of motors or relays, where the current is amplified from a safe low level of the computer output line to the amount needed by the connected device.

<doc id="109123" wikidata="Q1075868" url="?curid=109123" title="Chokoloskee, Florida">
<text>Chokoloskee is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located at the edge of the Ten Thousand Islands in Collier County, Florida, United States. The population was 345 at the 2020 census, down from 359 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Naples–Marco Island Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Chokoloskee was inhabited by Native Americans for at least 1500 years before European explorers first recorded visiting the island. It was briefly visited by Seminoles and the United States Army in the 1800s, and the current settlement can be traced back to 1874. Today, the isolated community&#x27;s economy is largely based on boating and recreational boat fishing in the Ten Thousand Islands and the nearby Gulf of Mexico and ecotourism to nearby Everglades National Park.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

Chokoloskee is located on Chokoloskee Island, which is opposite the mouth of the Turner River near the southeastern end of Chokoloskee Bay. The bay is about long and wide, and runs southeast to northwest along the mainland of Collier County. It is separated from the Gulf of Mexico by the northern end of the Ten Thousand Islands. Chokoloskee Island is connected to Everglades City on the mainland by a causeway.

The land around Chokoloskee Bay, both on the mainland and the islands, is very low-lying. Chokoloskee Island is an exception, as it reaches a high point of above sea level. This height is due to the shell mounds built on the island during more than 2,000 years of occupation by Native Americans of the Ten Thousand Islands district of the Glades culture.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 346 people, 155 households, and 106 families residing in the CDP.

===2000 census===
As of the census of 2000, there were 404 people, 183 households, and 139 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 589 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 98.51% White, 0.25% from other races, and 1.24% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino people of any race were 2.23% of the population.

There were 183 households, out of which 16.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 65.6% were married couples living together, 7.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 24.0% were non-families. 21.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 12.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.21 and the average family size was 2.53.

In the CDP, the age distribution of the population shows 16.3% under the age of 18, 5.0% from 18 to 24, 21.8% from 25 to 44, 32.2% from 45 to 64, and 24.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 50 years. For every 100 females, there were 98.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 101.2 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $33,750, and the median income for a family was $36,389. Males had a median income of $26,333 versus $19,250 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $16,847. About 2.4% of families and 1.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 3.7% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.

==History==

===Before European settlement===
Chokoloskee Island was inhabited by the indigenous Calusa and their ancestors for more than 1,500 years before European explorers reached the area. By the time Spain transferred Florida to Great Britain in 1763, the area was uninhabited. During the first three-quarters of the 19th century, Chokoloskee Island may have been occasionally visited by Seminoles, white hunters, &quot;Spanish Indian&quot; fishermen from Cuba and various &quot;refugees from justice&quot;.

Chokoloskee was briefly occupied by the United States Army during the Third Seminole War. In November 1856, 110 men of the Florida Mounted Volunteers reached Chokoloskee Island. From there, an expedition of 75 men went up the Turner River, where they burned a Seminole settlement and a couple of planted fields. After a skirmish with the Seminoles in which a Captain John Parkhill was killed, the expedition returned to Chokoloskee Island to find that their base had been moved to Cape Romano, because of a lack of fresh water on the island.

===Early settlement===
The modern settlement of Chokoloskee Island started in 1874. The first family to settle was the family of John Weeks. The second family on the island was that of Adolphus Santini, who was soon joined by his brother and his parents. By around 1880 the Santini family held claim to most of the island. In 1882 there were five families living on the island, including those of the two Santini brothers. These early residents farmed, fished and caught turtles, selling any surpluses in Key West. Other residents came and went fairly frequently. Due to the efforts of Charles Greenleigh (C.G.) McKinney, a post office was established in Chokoloskee in 1891, although it was known as &quot;Comfort&quot; for the first few months.

In 1897 Ted Smallwood moved to Chokoloskee Island. There were still just five other families on the island, including the Santini brothers. In 1899, the Santinis left and sold their claims to Smallwood, who became the major landholder on the island. Chokoloskee had acquired a post office in 1891, at first called Comfort, but changed to Chokoloskee within a year. At first, mail for Chokoloskee came by boat from Key West, then as the railroads extended down the Florida peninsula, the mail came from Punta Gorda and later from Fort Myers. After the highway reached Everglades City, it came by boat from there until the causeway to Chokoloskee Island was completed in 1956. Because of the uncertainty of the mail boat schedule, a conch shell would be blown to alert the islanders that the mail had arrived.

Chokoloskee Island was quite isolated. At first it was in Monroe County, with the county seat in Key West, away by boat and inaccessible by land. In 1887, Lee County was created out of part of Monroe County, including Chokoloskee, but the county seat was in Fort Myers, almost in the opposite direction from Key West. Finally, in 1923, Collier County was created out of Lee County, with the county seat at Everglades City, just a few miles across Chokoloskee Bay from Chokoloskee Island. However, access to the outside world was still by boat to Key West or Fort Myers until the Tamiami Trail was completed and connected to Everglades City in the late 1920s.

C.G. McKinney had moved to Chokoloskee in 1886. He had opened a small store soon afterwards and had been instrumental in getting the post office for Chokoloskee. In 1912 McKinney wrote a complaint about how Chokoloskee was being ignored. He was insulted that two recent letters to him had been addressed to &quot;Everglade&quot; (Everglades City). He wrote, &quot;Now I wish folks could learn that there is another part of this neck of the woods beside Everglade. Everglade is a small place beside Chokoloskee. We have two business houses... we have ten families living here.&quot;

===Ted Smallwood===

Starting in 1896 Ted Smallwood carried the mail by sailboat between Chokoloskee and Marco Island via Everglades [City]. In 1897 he married and settled down on Chokoloskee Island. He hunted alligators, cut buttonwood (for charcoal), fished, and raised tomatoes. In 1906 he became postmaster for Chokoloskee and opened a general store which housed the post office. He remained postmaster until he retired in 1941. His daughter succeeded him as postmaster.

Ted Smallwood died in 1951, but his daughters kept the store open until 1982. Ted Smallwood&#x27;s store was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. His granddaughter has opened the store as a museum.
===Edgar Watson===

The Ten Thousand Islands country, including Chokoloskee, had a reputation as being a refuge for outlaws. The Ed Watson story, as related by Ted Smallwood, is the best known example of that. Edgar Watson, a native of Ridge Springs, in the Saluda Division of Edgefield District, South Carolina, showed up in the Chokoloskee Bay country in the early 1880s. He had supposedly gotten into trouble in Columbia County in northern Florida, to which his parents had migrated sometime after 1870, and had then gone out to the Indian territory (later known as the Oklahoma Territory) where he allegedly killed Belle Starr, herself allegedly an outlaw. He then returned to Florida and killed a man in Arcadia, apparently in self-defense. After that Ed Watson moved to the Ten Thousand Islands area, then part of Monroe County, where he bought a claim on the Chatham Bend River and began raising vegetables.

On a trip to Key West, Watson got into an argument with Adolphus Santini and tried to cut his throat. Santini survived, but the incident cost Watson $900. After that Watson bought a claim on the Lost Man&#x27;s River, also in Monroe County. A man named Tucker soon squatted on the claim and would not leave. Eventually Tucker and his nephew were found murdered, and suspicion fell on Watson. After that Watson went back to Fort White, Columbia County. While there he again became involved with bad company, and came under suspicion in the deaths of two men.

Watson returned to the Chatham Bend area and began making syrup from sugar cane. According to legend, Watson would &quot;pay&quot; his African-American and Native American help by killing them on payday. Soon Watson had several people living at his place, including a man named Dutchy Melvin, who is said to have &quot;killed a policeman and burned a factory or two.&quot; While Watson and Melvin were in Chokoloskee, a man named Cox and someone identified only as &quot;the Nigger&quot; allegedly killed an old woman named Hannah Smith and a man named Walker at the Watson place. When Watson and Melvin returned, Cox and &quot;the Nigger&quot; allegedly killed Melvin as well. Hannah Smith&#x27;s body was later found in the Chatham Bend River by some settlers and given a burial.

About this time, on October 17, 1910, a major hurricane struck the area. Ed Watson went to Fort Myers during the hurricane and tried to bring the sheriff back afterwards to arrest Cox, but the Lee County sheriff would not go out of his jurisdiction past Marco. Watson then bought some shells at Ted Smallwood&#x27;s store and said he was going back to his place to kill Cox. When Watson returned to Chokoloskee a few days later a crowd met him at the landing and, after a brief standoff, killed him. The sheriff did come down to Chokoloskee after that, and took a number of Chokoloskee residents back to Fort Myers for a court session, but nothing came of it. Edgar Watson was buried in Fort Myers cemetery.

Peter Matthiessen fictionalized the story in his Watson trilogy (&quot;Killing Mister Watson&quot;, &quot;Lost Man&#x27;s River&quot;, &quot;Bone by Bone&quot;) and retold the &quot;Watson Legend&quot; in &quot;Shadow Country&quot;. Matthiessen inspired the Decemberists to retell the story as &quot;E. Watson&quot; on their EP &quot;Long Live the King&quot;.
Florida based swamp rock &amp; blues band MOFRO relates some of the story in a song titled &quot;Ten Thousand Islands&quot; from the album &quot;Lochloosa&quot;.

===Education, religion and medical care===
As a small, isolated community, Chokoloskee did not support a continuously operating school or church. A small school building was erected, and teachers were sent on occasion, but the teachers were not generally prepared for the life at Chokoloskee, and most did not stay very long. The children of Chokoloskee Island did not attend school past the eighth grade until the late 1930s, when some began attending high school in Everglades City and Naples.

Religious services were also sporadic. A priest would come up from Key West on occasion to provide for the Catholics on the island. Protestant preachers also visited the island, and a small mission church was built. One week in 1915 there were two preachers on the island, with competing revival meetings every night.

The Chokoloskee Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee) was founded in 1913 and is the third oldest church in Chokoloskee.

Except for a &quot;Doctor&quot; S.L. Greene who lived there for a few months, Chokoloskee Island never had a resident physician. C.G. McKinney provided most of the medical care on the island for 50 years. He was registered with the State Board of Health as a midwife, treated injuries and illnesses, and extracted teeth. His dental care was supplemented by the occasional visit of an itinerant dentist.

<text>Everglades City is a city in Collier County, Florida, United States, of which it was once the county seat. It is part of the Naples–Marco Island Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the Cape Coral-Fort Myers-Naples Combined Statistical Area. The Gulf Coast Visitor Center for Everglades National Park is located in Everglades City. As of the 2020 US census, the population was 352, down from 400 in the 2010 US census. 

==History==

The area around Chokoloskee Bay, including the site of Everglades City, was occupied for thousands of years by Native Americans of the Glades culture, who were absorbed by the Calusa shortly before the arrival of Europeans in the New World, but by the time Florida was transferred from Spain to the United States in 1821, the area was uninhabited. A legend says that Seminoles planted potatoes along what is now the Barron River during the Seminole Wars, in the vicinity of the present Everglades City.

American settlement began after the Civil War, when Union sympathizers who had farmed on Cape Sable to supply Key West during the war moved up the west coast of the peninsula. The first permanent settler was William Smith Allen, who arrived on the banks of Potato Creek (later renamed the Allen River) in 1873. After Allen retired to Key West in 1889, George W. Storter, Jr. became the principal landowner in the area. Storter gained fame for his sugar cane crops. He opened a trading post in 1892, and gained a post office, called &quot;Everglade&quot;, in 1895. Storter also began entertaining northern tourists who came to Everglade by yacht in the winter to hunt and fish. His house eventually grew into the Rod and Gun Club, visited by United States Presidents and other notables.

The first school in Everglade was organized in 1893. The school moved into a new building in 1895, but the building was destroyed by a tornado later in the year. The next school building was washed away by the 1910 hurricane. A Methodist circuit rider began visiting Everglade in 1888, and another Methodist minister began a four-year residency the next year. After that, Everglade was occasionally visited by itinerant preachers of various denominations. The Episcopal Church established a mission at Immokalee which eventually moved to Everglade when revitalized in the 1930s by Harriet Bedell.

In 1922, Barron Collier began buying large areas of land in what was then southern Lee County. In 1923, the Florida legislature created Collier County from Lee County, and they chose the county seat to be in Everglade. During that same year, it only consisted of a dozen families, but some northern sportsmen had established winter homes there. Also in 1923, the community was officially incorporated as the &quot;Town of Everglades&quot; (adding the &quot;s&quot;). 

The Tamiami Trail, which crossed Collier&#x27;s domain, passed five miles north of Everglades City. While construction was proceeding on the Trail (it was completed in 1929), Collier pushed construction of what became State Road 29 from Everglades City to Immokalee, providing the town with its first land connection to the rest of the state. In 1928, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad began service to Everglades City, which became the southernmost point the Coast Line ever reached. Service was provided by an extension of the Coast Line&#x27;s Haines City Branch from Immokalee to Deep Lake, where it connected to Collier&#x27;s Deep Lake Railroad, an earlier railroad that transported agricultural freight. The railroad was removed in 1957.

In 1953, the &quot;Town of Everglades&quot; became the &quot;City of Everglades&quot;. In 1960, the strong winds and coastal flooding of Hurricane Donna combined to destroy 153 homes in Collier County, as well as inflict major damage on 409 more, and damage an additional 1,049. Everglades was hard hit, and two years later, Florida&#x27;s legislature moved the county seat to East Naples, Florida. In 1965, the state legislature changed the city&#x27;s name to the &quot;City of Everglades City&quot;.

==Media==
Immokalee is home to WCIW-LP, a low power community radio station owned and operated by the Coalition of Immokalee Workers. The station was built by volunteers from Immokalee and around the country in December 2003 at the fifth Prometheus Radio Project barnraising. WCIW broadcasts music, news, and public affairs to listeners in Spanish, Haitian Creole and several indigenous languages.

WAFZ-FM (92.1 FM) is a full-power FM radio station licensed to Immokalee, Florida. The station plays a variety of hits in the Regional Mexican format. In the 1980s, WAFZ also played Tejano music on its sister station WAFZ-AM. In its beginnings WAFZ was WZOR-AM 1490 and played English-language adult contemporary music and news in the morning and until 3pm. Then it changed its format to Regional Mexican/Tejano. The early DJs who worked there were Gabino Soliz, &quot;EL CHAVO ALEGRE&quot;, and Irma Ayala. The station continued on the air until the mid-1990s, when it went silent until what is now WAFZ was bought by Glades Media Company LLC, and transmitted simultaneously what WAFZ-FM was playing (a regional Mexican format). The current format of WAFZ is a young Regional Mexican, playing newer top 40 hits of the genre.

WAFZ&#x27;s programming is also heard on WAFZ AM 1490 in Immokalee.

==Transportation==
Collier Area Transit provides local bus service and paratransit. The #5 connects to Naples, the #7 connects to Marco Island (limited trips), and the 8A circulates within the area.

Immokalee used to be served by the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad (formerly Atlantic Coast Line), which ran a branchline from Palmdale through Immokalee to Everglades City. The line generated considerable agricultural-related traffic. The line was cut back to Sunniland south of Immokalee in the 1950s and then abandoned to the mainline at Palmdale in the 1980s. This left Immokalee without rail service.

The main road through Immokalee is State Road 29. Other important county roads through the region are CR 29A and CR 846.

Immokalee Airport is a public-use general aviation airport northeast of the central business district. The closest airport for commercial service is Southwest Florida International Airport.

<doc id="109131" wikidata="Q985306" url="?curid=109131" title="Marco Island, Florida">
<text>Marco Island is a city and barrier island in Collier County, Florida, south of Naples on the Gulf Coast of the United States. It is the largest barrier island in Southwest Florida&#x27;s Ten Thousand Islands area, which extends southerly to Cape Sable. Marco Island is home to an affluent beach community with resort amenities.

Marco Island is a principal city of the Naples–Marco Island Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 15,760 at the 2020 census, down from 16,413 at the 2010 census. The population more than doubles during the winter.

Parts of the island have scenic, high elevations relative to the generally flat south Florida landscape. The island has a tropical climate; specifically, a tropical wet and dry or savanna type (&quot;Aw&quot; under the Köppen system). It is known for its distinct wet and dry seasons, with most of the rainfall between June and October.

==History==

Marco Island&#x27;s history can be traced to 500 CE, when the Calusa people inhabited the island as well as the rest of southwest Florida. A number of Calusa artifacts were discovered on Key Marco (an island then adjacent, and since attached, to Marco Island) in 1896 by anthropologist Frank Hamilton Cushing as part of the Pepper-Hearst Expedition. The most notable artifact discovered was the carved wooden &quot;Key Marco Cat&quot;, now on display at the Marco Island Historical Museum under a loan from the Smithsonian Institution. The artifact is featured on a 1989 postage stamp.

When Spanish explorers came to the island in the mid-1500s, they gave the island the name &quot;La Isla de San Marcos&quot; after St. Mark, traditionally considered the author of the Gospel of Mark. Early development of the island began in the late 1800s after the arrival of William Thomas Collier and his family. Collier founded the village of Marco on the island in 1870, and in 1896 his son, William D. &quot;Capt. Bill&quot; Collier, opened a hotel on the island, known today as the Olde Marco Inn. Clam digging became a major industry on Marco Island and throughout the Ten Thousand Islands in the early 1900s. The Burnham Clam Cannery began operation near Caxambas Pass in 1903 and operated until 1929. The Doxsee Clam Cannery also operated from 1911 to 1947. In 1912, ferry service began between Marco Island and the Isles of Capri. A road on the mainland linked the ferry landing with East Naples (just west of State Road 951). A small piece of this road remains and is known as Barefoot Williams Road.

Barron G. Collier (whom Collier County is named after, and no relation to William T. Collier) purchased a large amount of land on Marco Island in 1922, and in 1927 the island incorporated as Collier City. Collier City was abolished in 1957. James Harvey Doxsee Sr. served as Collier City&#x27;s only mayor. Also in 1927, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad began service to the island after extending its route from Fort Myers and Naples. The railroad ran to the island along the present route of State Road 951. Rail service was discontinued in 1944. The first vehicle bridge to the island was a small wooden swing bridge built in 1938 near Goodland on the island&#x27;s east side. Remnants of this bridge can be seen next to the current bridge at the site, the Stan Gober Memorial Bridge (built in 1975). The island&#x27;s ferry service was discontinued after the original Goodland Bridge opened.

Significant development of Marco Island took place in the 1960s that made it into the retirement and tourist destination it is today. The Mackle brothers of the Deltona Corporation led development of the island after purchasing large amounts of land there for $7 million. As a result of development, the S.S. Jolley Bridge opened for traffic in 1969. Marco Island reincorporated as a city on August 28, 1997. As in many coastal communities, residents battle short-term rentals and traffic congestion. On September 28, 2022, Hurricane Ian devastated the island with an 8&#x27; storm surge.

==Geography==

<text>Naples is a city in Collier County, Florida, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 19,115, down from 19,539 at the 2010 census. Naples is a principal city of the Naples–Marco Island metropolitan area, which had a population of about 375,752 as of 2020.

The city is known mostly for its high-priced homes, white-sand beaches, and numerous golf courses. Naples is the self-titled &quot;Golf Capital of the World&quot;, as it has the second most holes per capita out of all communities, and the most holes of any city in Florida. The city is also known for being appealing to retirees, who make up a large percentage of the population.

== History ==
Before the period of European colonization, the indigenous Calusa lived in Florida (including the region of present-day Naples) for thousands of years, from Charlotte Harbor to Cape Sable. In 1513, Spanish &quot;conquistador&quot; Juan Ponce de León explored the region and encountered the Calusa, who resisted attempts by de León to establish a Spanish colony in Florida. This initiated nearly two hundred years of conflict between the Spanish and the Calusa. In the early 18th century, following slave raids from Muscogee and Yamasee raiders allied with European settlers in Carolina, the majority of the remaining Calusa moved south and east to escape the raids.

The city of Naples was founded in 1886 by former Confederate general and Kentucky U.S. Senator John Stuart Williams and his partner, Louisville businessman Walter N. Haldeman, the publisher of the &quot;Louisville Courier-Journal&quot;. Throughout the 1870s and 1880s, magazines and newspapers ran stories about the area&#x27;s mild climate and abundant fish and likened it to the sunny Italian peninsula. The name Naples caught on when promoters described the bay as &quot;surpassing the bay in Naples, Italy&quot;. By the summer of 1888, Naples had a population of about 80 people, and the first hotel opened in 1889. Major development was anticipated after Collier County was established in 1923, the completion of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad extension in 1927, and the completion of the Tamiami Trail linking Naples to Miami in 1928, but did not begin until after the 1929 Stock market crash, the Great Depression, and World War II. During the war the U.S. Army Air Forces built a small airfield and used it for training purposes; it is now the Naples Municipal Airport.

In 1938, John Glenn Sample, a pioneer in radio advertising from Chicago, came to Naples. He had read about the fame and fortune of Palm Beach; however, he decided to look elsewhere and discovered the relaxed atmosphere that Naples had to offer on the Gulf of Mexico and soon began buying property on the south end of Naples below 5th Avenue and along Naples Bay, which consisted mostly of marshland. In 1949, Naples officially became a city, and the Bank of Naples, the city&#x27;s first banking service, opened on 5th Avenue. In the early 50&#x27;s, Sample began dredging to create numerous peninsulas and canals with lots overlooking the Naples Bay. He nicknamed the project &quot;Port Royal&quot;, which was conceived after the 17th century Jamaican city of Port Royal. The neighborhood&#x27;s streets are all named in pirate tradition, examples being names like Gin Lane, Rum Row, Treasure Lane, and Galleon Drive. Works to pave streets in the neighborhood were completed in the late 1970s.

In March 1956, the first modern medical facility was opened in Naples with the name Naples Community Hospital. In the 1960s the historic Cove Inn on Naples Bay was built, as well as the Collier County Public Library, and Cambier Park on 8th Avenue.

In May 1971 passenger train service to the city was discontinued by Amtrak; the station is now called Naples Depot Museum, and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places three years later.

Sample&#x27;s dredging project with Port Royal also spurred developments in the 60s and 70s like Aqualane Shores, Park Shore, and Moorings, all affluent neighborhoods in Naples with large, waterfront homes that have boat access. In 1977, the city&#x27;s first mall, the Coastland Center, was opened.

Supplies were brought in by steamboat on the Santa Fe River and distributed to other area forts. Due to sickness, flooding along the river and rumors of the railroad coming to the area, the settlement was moved east to its present location.

Named after the military fort, in 1884, the Town of Fort White was officially incorporated and grew steadily, following the arrival of the railroad in 1888. Phosphate mining, turpentine and agriculture (cotton and oranges) were the foundation of the economy, and the population grew to nearly 2,000. The boom turned to bust as severe freezes in the winters of 1896 and 1897 destroyed the local citrus industry. By 1910, the largest phosphate deposits were depleted and mining ceased. The boll weevil ended cotton farming before World War I, and the population shrank to a few hundred people, primarily farmers, ranchers and foresters. The town&#x27;s population in 1979 was 365.

===The Ichetucknee River===
The locals have always known of and enjoyed the crystal clear Ichetucknee River and springs, located northwest of the town. However, before 1970, the existence and location of this natural wonder were not widely known. The road to the spring was not paved, nor was it marked, because the spring was on private property. In 1970, the state of Florida purchased the Ichetucknee spring and river property from the Loncala Phosphate Corporation. Columbia County built a paved road, number 238, providing easier access to the springs. In 1972, the head spring of the river was declared a National Natural Landmark by the U.S. Department of the Interior. The main tributary from Ichetucknee Springs became one of the most popular tubing destinations in the world, attracting up to 5,000 visitors each day during the summer. Others came to the river to swim, picnic, snorkel, scuba dive, and explore the nearby forests.

==Schools==

The public schools located within the Town of Fort White are served by the Columbia County School District.

*Fort White Elementary School
*Fort White Middle School
*Fort White High School

The original Fort White High School was constructed during 1915, and an auditorium was added in 1936. Separate elementary school classrooms were completed in 1938.

The last high school class to graduate was in 1969, about the same time desegregation and integration forced the closing of the black schools in the area. At that time, there weren&#x27;t enough children to justify a high school in Fort White; students in grades 9–12 were bused to Columbia High School in Lake City for over 30 years. After Ichetucknee Springs State Park opened in 1971, the population in the south end of the county steadily grew to the point where the need for a local facility was substantiated. 

A $25 million high school was completed in December 2000 for grades 6–12, having opened in August 2000, in temporary buildings because of construction delays. The school had been scheduled for completion in August 2000. Fort White High School graduated the first class in a generation in 2001. A new Fort White Middle School for grade 6 was completed prior to the 2008–2009 school year. The rest of the middle school (for grades 7 and 8) has recently been finished and is in use, though the middle and high school are still joined.
