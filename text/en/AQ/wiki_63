<text>Gurnee ( ) is a village and suburb in Lake County, Illinois, United States. Its population was 30,706 as of the 2020 census. It borders the city of Waukegan, and is a popular tourist attraction within the Chicago metropolitan area. 

Best known for being the location of Six Flags Great America, Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Chicago and Gurnee Mills, the village sees an average of over 23 million visitors annually.

== History ==
Early settlers in the Gurnee area came by foot horseback and by &quot;Prairie Schooners&quot; drawn by oxen or via the Erie Canal and the Great Lakes. They came from the town of Warren, New York, which was named in honor of Major General Joseph Warren, killed at the Battle of Bunker Hill. Warren Township, formed in 1850, was also named after him. The first settlement of Warren Township commenced in 1835 in the vicinity of the Aux Plaines River (now the Des Plaines River).

In 1835–36, a land company from New York State erected a Community House (site of the old Gurnee Grade School) to accommodate families while they were locating and getting government land grants to their farms. Near the Community House, there was a ford used by the Potowatomi Indians for crossing the river. A floating log bridge was built in 1842. Later, both a wood and iron bridge were built.

With the erection of a permanent bridge, roads were established, and this area became the hub of the township. It was at this junction that the Milwaukee Road crossed the river from west to east, and then continued north to eventually connect Chicago to Milwaukee. This road was &quot;laid out&quot; in 1836 by three early settlers: Thomas McClure, Mark Noble, and Richard Steele. The east–west road, now known as Grand Avenue, was a main route from McHenry County to the port of Waukegan. Stage coaches ran on this route as late as 1870.

The hamlet was originally called &quot;Wentworth&quot;, after Congressman &quot;Long John&quot; Wentworth, who also served as the Republican Mayor of Chicago between 1857 and 1863. Thereafter, Walter S. Gurnee, the 14th Mayor of Chicago and one of the directors of the railroad, agreed to develop a station in Wentworth, which was called &quot;Gurnee Station&quot; in his honor. Over time, Gurnee Station became known simply as &quot;Gurnee&quot; and was incorporated as such.

Just east of the bridge, at the junction of Milwaukee Road and Grand Avenue, was the Mutaw Tavern, earlier known as &quot;Marm Rudd&#x27;s Tavern&quot; and more recently as the Mother Rudd House. This was a stage coach stop between Chicago and Milwaukee and was a stopover for farmers from the west traveling to Little Fort (now known as Waukegan) to barter their crops for supplies and to ship out from the ports. It also served as a stop during the Underground Railroad. This building was acquired by the Village of Gurnee in 1984, has been restored, and now houses the Warren Township Historical Society.

In May 2004, Gurnee received major rainfall, causing the worst flooding in 100 years. The flood forced several schools to close and caused building damage to dozens of homes and businesses.

<text>Hainesville is a village in Avon Township, Lake County, Illinois, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 3,546. Hainesville has the distinction of being the oldest incorporated community within Lake County.

==History==
In 1838, a young boy named Elijah M. Haines (1822–1889) and his family moved from New York City to the Chicago area. In 1836, the young boy purchased a farm in Hainesville. During the winter of 1841–42, Haines taught school in Waukegan, Illinois (then known as Little Fort). In 1846, he surveyed and platted Hainesville. On February 26, 1847, the village incorporation papers were drafted. It is recorded that Elijah Haines met Abraham Lincoln in 1847. The two men met frequently and became well acquainted. It has been said that Lincoln spent the night in Hainesville a few times.

In 1848, construction began on the Lake and McHenry Plank Road. By 1851, the road was completed to Squaw Creek just west of Hainesville, and the settlement became the location for one of three toll houses.

In 1851, Haines was accepted to the bar, and a year later he moved to Waukegan. In 1859, he was sent to the state legislature where he served eight terms. He was a member of the Illinois Constitutional Convention of 1869-70 and is considered by some historians to have been its most influential member.

Hainesville was becoming a thriving village, but the village all but disappeared off the map until recent years. In 1899, the Milwaukee Road railroad expanded into Lake County, providing convenient transportation from the area into Chicago. Local land owner, general store proprietor and Hainesville postmaster George Battershall asked for a large sum of money to build a train station in Hainesville. Milwaukee Road had no other options in Hainesville as the railway entered and exited the village of Hainesville on Battershall&#x27;s property (essentially everything south of the Plank Road in Hainesville). Amarias M. White, an early settler of what is now Round Lake, knowing that a railroad stop in Round Lake would spark commerce for his area, attracted the railroad company by offering the land for a depot for free. Unfortunately for Hainesville, commerce did start to move away from Hainesville and into Round Lake, as well as neighboring Grayslake.

The Hainesville post office closed in 1919. A few years later, the old wooden Hainesville School was destroyed by a tornado. In 1940, a new brick structure school was built near the Belvidere Road and Main Street split, but in 1945 the school became part of the Round Lake School system. In 1982, the building became Hainesville&#x27;s village hall until 2005 when a new hall was built on Hainesville Road.

After several decades of being not much more than a handful of crossroads, Hainesville finally exploded into a sprawling suburban neighborhood. In 1990, large parcels of what was once farm land to the east of Hainesville Road and north of Belvidere Road were developed into Misty Hill Farm by U.S. Shelter Group. In 1994 Deerpoint Trails was built by Deer Point Homes. In 2000, land around the south side of the former cranberry bog appropriately named Cranberry Lake just east of Hainesville Road was developed into homes. In 2001, the former Softball City, a multi-use sports complex adjacent to the Avon Township Youth Baseball Organization facilities, sold its land to Ryland Homes, and this became the townhouse community called Union Square.

In 2002, Grayslake Community Consolidated School District (CCSD) 46 built the kindergarten to 4th grade Prairieview School on Belvidere Road. In 2003, the land to the north of Cranberry Lake, just south of Washington Street, was developed into a townhouse community called Cranberry Lake North.

Despite a census just being taken in 2000, a special census was requested in 2004 due to the explosive growth of the area. This census yielded a population totaling 3,444, up over 60% from what it was only four years prior.

==Geography==
Hainesville is located at (42.348754, -88.068743).

According to the 2010 census, Hainesville has a total area of , of which (or 98.13%) is land and (or 1.87%) is water.

<doc id="111464" wikidata="Q577601" url="?curid=111464" title="Highwood, Illinois">
<text>Highwood is a North Shore suburb of Chicago in Moraine Township, Lake County, Illinois, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 5,074. It is known for its entertainment, restaurants, bars, and festivals.

== Geography ==
Highwood is located in southeastern Lake County at , on a ridge above the elevation of Lake Michigan.

According to the 2010 census, Highwood has a total area of , all land.

The city is located next to Highland Park and Fort Sheridan, and south of the Fort Sheridan Forest Preserve.

== History ==

Originally, the land was owned by the Potawatomi until it was ceded to the United States through the 1833 Treaty of Chicago. The first non-Native American settled in the town in 1846. In 1851 Highwood became the headquarter location of the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad, which ran parallel to the Chicago and North Western Railway, and is known today as Metra&#x27;s Union Pacific / North Line. Thomas Curley suggested the name High Woods because the land was the highest ground between Chicago and Milwaukee and was covered with trees.

In 1886 civil and labor unrest in Chicago eventually led to the Haymarket Riot. Chicago businessmen felt that having a military presence near the city would help alleviate tensions within the city and on November 8, 1887 purchased Camp Highwood. This land would come to host members of the Sixth Infantry Regiment. On February 27, 1888 Camp Highwood was officially named Fort Sheridan in honor of General Philip Sheridan for his ability to maintain order after the Chicago Fire of 1871.

Highwood provided several business and employment opportunities and following the fire, many of those who lost their home and a wave of immigrants settled into the town. Highwood can also give credit to much of their economic success to the Chicago and Milwaukee Electric Railway. However, with increased transportation it also caused a sudden rise in gambling dens and illegal &quot;blind-pig&quot; taverns which catered to off duty soldiers. This eventually provoked federal authorities to enact the &quot;Highwood Quadrangle&quot; which prohibited the sale of liquor within 1 1/8th miles of the army base.

Fort Sheridan acted as an entertainment center for the town and on July 18, 1888 the trustees voted to change the name from Highwood to the Village of Fort Sheridan to capitalize on its military glamour. However, 8 years later in 1894 the name was changed back to Highwood due to resident frustration and confusion with postal misrouting. The city&#x27;s business district became filled with bars and taverns which led Theodore Roosevelt to call the city &quot;one of the toughest towns in America&quot;.

In the 1920s a large number of Northern Italian immigrants (originally from Modena) moved to Highwood, many from Dalzell, Illinois, a coal mining town in Bureau County, to seek jobs. The national prohibition of alcohol at the time also attracted bootleggers who smuggled large quantities of liquor into the city. The fight to prevent Highwood from being known as a whisky den largely brought the community together.

Following the start of World War II Fort Sheridan was used as an active training ground. By the end of the war Highwood had experienced another wave of immigration, this time a majority of immigrants coming from Europe and Mexico. Since then Highwood&#x27;s business have continued to flourish and the city has become the destination for North Shore dining and nightlife. The city frequently hosts festivals for residents known as Celebrate Highwood which is hosted by the city chambers.

== Government ==
Highwood operates an council-manager government.
== Transportation ==

The main highway to Highwood is U.S. Route 41, which connects Chicago to Milwaukee. Commuter rail is available at two different Metra stations locations within the city (Fort Sheridan and Highwood). Highwood is also located near the Highland Park and Lake Forest stations which all located on the Union Pacific North Line which begins in Kenosha and ends in the downtown area of Chicago at Ogilvie Transportation Center.

Pace provides bus service on Route 472 connecting Highwood to Highland Park, Fort Sheridan, and other destinations.

The city is approximately from O&#x27;Hare International Airport and from Midway International Airport.

==Schools==
Highwood residents are served by North Shore School District 112 and Township High School District 113. The majority of Highwood&#x27;s children attend Oak Terrace School for Kindergarten through fifth grade, Northwood Junior High School for sixth through eighth grade, and Highland Park High School for grades nine through twelve.

St. James School was a private Catholic school located in Highwood, but closed in 2015 due to a lack of funding and low enrollment.

== Recreation ==

The Don Skrinar Recreation Center is a public recreation facility located near downtown Highwood. The city is also a host to the Midwest Young Artists Conservatory and The Performer&#x27;s School. The Fine Art Studio of ROTBLATT-AMRANY which is owned by Julie Rotblatt Amrany is located within the old village of Fort Sheridan.

This location may be confused with the Indian Creek Massacre, detailed below, which actually occurred in LaSalle County near Ottawa, IL. During the Black Hawk War of 1832, which was the last Indian war in Illinois, Indian Creek, was the scene of an attack, by a renegade band of 40-80 Potawatomi and Sauk, on the Davis Settlement, where 15 white settlers were killed and scalped.

<doc id="111467" wikidata="Q2544695" url="?curid=111467" title="Kildeer, Illinois">
<text>Kildeer is a village in southwestern Lake County, Illinois, United States, and a suburb of Chicago. Per the 2020 census, the population was 4,091. It has limited development to custom houses on large lots, and has worked to preserve natural features and open space.

==History==

This area was largely rural and made up of farms and undeveloped lands until after World War II. Increased population and pent-up demand for housing resulted in new suburban development outside many major cities, aided by federal investment in highways that eased commuting to work. Lake County began to prepare by paving its roads and improving some. The Kildeer area began to attract persons who wanted to live a relatively rural life. In 1951 Quentin Road was realigned, removing the four right-angle turns, and substituting a smooth curve north from Rand Road. In 1952 its entire length was paved.

In the mid-1950s, Henry Bosch Jr. submitted a residential subdivision to the county containing mostly homesites. On April 15, 1955, it was approved and called Boschome Farms. Bosch wanted to retain strict control of his subdivision and refused to sell lots to builders. As a condition of sale, each purchaser had to submit plans for their residence to Bosch and receive his approval prior to building. Not long after, the land south of Boschome Farms was subdivided as Long Grove Valley. Unit I was approved September 16, 1955, Unit 2 on February 1, 1957, and Unit 3 on June 20, 1957.

===Brickman Builders===

On October 16, 1958, Brickman Builders of Chicago announced their intent to build a planned community &quot;of the future&quot; consisting of 20,000 residential units in Ela Township, Lake County. This planned community would cover south and southeast of Lake Zurich. It would contain 16,000 single-family homes, 6,000 apartments or duplex units, one high school, four junior high schools, 29 grade schools, a country club, and ten church sites. Ten percent of the area would be reserved for industrial use. The development would have an ultimate population of 60,000 and take 15 years to build. There would be a central shopping mall at West Cuba and Quentin Road containing a major department store, a variety store, ten small shops, one or more supermarkets, a bank, two drugstores, two restaurants, a professional and medical center, with provisions for parking 2,500 cars. Six smaller shopping centers were also to be located in neighborhoods.

When Joseph M. Brickman announced his &quot;billion dollar city&quot;, he claimed to have bought or had options on 2,000 of the required . He said it would be the largest planned community in the country. It would bring organized development with planned infrastructure and amenities to the projected rapid growth of the area. Existing residents were surprised, as many had moved here to enjoy the tranquil countryside. They learned that Brickman intended to incorporate his land as a village. If there were 100 residents and 35 voters living within the prescribed boundaries, they could hold a referendum to establish a village form of government. The existing residents feared that Brickman could effectively select individuals to have voted into office, and form his own government, passing codes and ordinances to serve his own interests.

In the summer of 1957 Brickman began building a subdivision on Sturm&#x27;s farm, located on the south side of Rand Road just west of Quentin Road. He rented the completed homes to Brickman real estate agents and other company employees. Surrounding residents became suspicious when they learned that such renters were paying only $50 per month for a three-bedroom house. Brickman was rumored to be moving migrant farm workers into structures on other properties. People became convinced that Brickman would shortly incorporate the Sturm Subdivision and systematically annex his adjacent parcels. Brickman was seeking rezoning from Lake County of the latter properties in order to permit small lots, which would enable more dense development.

Inspired by longtime resident Dorothea Huszagh, local residents organized and petitioned to hold a referendum on incorporating a municipality. Brickman attempted to move a small red barn west on East Cuba Road to use as housing for his workers. Although the barn was mounted on a truck, it could not be transported across the one-lane bridge over Buffalo Creek because of large overhanging oak tree branches. The foreman ordered the branches to be cut down but neighbors told him the tree was on private property and a confrontation ensued. By the time the County police arrived, Rudy Huszagh had fired a rifle into the ground to stop the workmen. The police ordered the workers to take the barn back to the farm and dispersed the residents.

On September 8, 1996, the village of Kildeer mounted a plaque on the bridge dedicating it as a memorial to Dorothea Huszagh, who died in 1995, and to others who had opposed the 1950s planned development of this area.

===Incorporation===

On March 22, 1958, residents held a referendum on the question of establishing the Village of Kildeer. Area residents voted to incorporate the new village with a population of 153, making it the 32nd municipality in Lake County. The polling place for this election was the home of Dorothea Huszagh. Brickman filed suit to have the referendum overturned, asking the support of Deer Park and Long Grove village boards to support the dissolution of the village of Kildeer. They declined, as these villages had been incorporated in 1957 and 1959 as protection against being included in Brickman&#x27;s grand plan.

The Lake Zurich village board voted four to three against Brickman&#x27;s county rezoning attempt. Just prior to their vote, the same board had voted to rescind their required $275 contribution per home and 10 percent land dedication by builders. Some analysts thought Brickman had intended to gain rezoning by first annexing his land to Lake Zurich and later disconnecting to form a separate village.

In April 1958 a meeting of Kildeer village residents was held. The following people were selected and sworn in to serve as Kildeer&#x27;s first officials.
*President - J. Larry Powell
*Village Clerk - Hertha G. Severance
*Trustees - Edwin G. Bradshaw, Harold S. Faber, Richard W. Huszagh, Harry P. Keeley Jr., C. J. Lauer, P. H. Severance
*Police Magistrate - Samuel S. LaBue

About March 12, 1959, the Lake County Board unanimously rejected Brickman&#x27;s small lot zoning request. He sued to reverse the Board&#x27;s decision, but in September the Circuit Court of Waukegan upheld the decision. In November Brickman lost his challenge of the Kildeer referendum; he said he would appeal the case to the Illinois Supreme Court. On June 9, 1960, the Supreme Court found in favor of Kildeer. The battle was over. Brickman left the area after selling a parcel of to the Arthur T. Mcintosh Co., who developed the property as a subdivision called &quot;Farmington&quot;.

The new Kildeer village board had many tasks: First, it had to dispose of legal bills accumulated from opposing Brickman. Not having any revenue sources, the board appealed for contributions from the 45 families that made up the village. The funds received fell short by only $362.00, indicating a strong community spirit. The village president and three trustees (because of staggered terms) were appointed to one-year terms only. The first official village election was held in April 1959, at which time a new president, Harry P. Keeley, Jr., and three new trustees were elected. These officials, along with the three remaining trustees, went to work establishing commissions, ordinances, codes and sources of revenue. This was no small task. Without a public facility, all meetings were held in their homes and long hours spent on village business.

A small contingent of residents began agitating to abolish Kildeer and merge into the village of Long Grove. The issue became so heated that some members of village commissions submitted resignations. President Keeley wrote a letter to all village officials and staff stating,

&quot;The resignations that have been handed to the village board within the past month are very alarming to me as the President of the Board, and I am deeply concerned over the internal strife which has been going on. It seems to me that as adults, with reasoning power that has been given to us, we should be able to resolve our differences in an adult manner. We are doing to ourselves what Mr. Brickman with all of his law suits could not do. We are being destroyed from within by smear campaigns, rumors, half truths, etc. I am in hopes that the gentlemen who submitted their resignations will reconsider and will realize that our differences can never be resolved by any means other than hard work, gathering of facts, and reasoning.&quot; &quot;The Board and I have seen fit at this time to not accept the resignations, a matter on which we shall have to take action at the special meeting that I am calling for next Monday night to finish much business that we were not able to get to at our regular meeting.&quot;

President Keeley appointed a special representative to gather information relating to a merger with Long Grove. He went to great lengths accumulating the facts and summarizing his own views on the negative aspects of such a merger in a letter to the Board of Trustees containing the following closing statement. &quot;In light of the facts mentioned above, I feel that though we have won the battle of Brickman, we have lost the war for self preservation and home rule. I feel that your part in this administration is a failure if you condone the merger with Long Grove. I cannot and will not be part of such a movement. Therefore, with sincere regret and much sorrow, I herewith submit my resignation as President of the Village of Kildeer.&quot; Records show President Keeley served out his four-year term and the merger with Long Grove obviously did not occur. It must be assumed the majority of the village board supported their President&#x27;s position and convinced him to withdraw his resignation, but the issue would be sensitive to some for many years to come.

===Facilities===
To dispose of sewage, all Kildeer residences had septic fields. Soils in the area were of the type considered &quot;extreme&quot; for this purpose, and septic fields in general in Lake County were experiencing difficulties, adding to the pollution of local streams, rivers and lakes. The Lake County Health Department progressively increased their standards to eliminate a growing problem. A longtime resident and Kildeer trustee, Frank Angelotti, had his own civil engineering company doing consulting work for other villages. He was aware of federal funds available through the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) to assist municipalities in the construction of local sewers. Early in 1975, Trustee Angelotti, at his own expense, prepared schematic drawings of a sewer system for the entire village of Kildeer. The system would tie into a new Lake County interceptor sewer to be installed on Quentin Road for relieving Lake Zurich&#x27;s sewage treatment plant. Lake County, by agreement and service charges, would provide all sewage treatment. He presented his plan to the Kildeer Village Board.

In addition to serving Kildeer, it was proposed to extend sewers to Rand Road. Having the only sewer system in the area would give Kildeer complete control of any and all development along Rand Road and its surrounding borders. The residential system was designed for 4½ people per acre which would limit and control the density of residential development. If approved, the IEPA would provide 75% funding for the project. Seeing the merits of this project and the fact federal funding would be a one-time opportunity, the village board moved to submit an application to the IEPA. The construction estimate was $1,811,000, of which Kildeer&#x27;s 25% share would be $452,750, or $834 per residential lot. The first step was accomplished on December 16, 1975, when the Lake County Regional Planning Commission endorsed the plan. On May 26, 1976, a grant application for $1,358,250 was sent to the IEPA, and approval was received on June 25.

To confirm all costs, construction and engineering bids were solicited on March 15, 1977. Quotations were within the budget and a village referendum was held on May 14 with citizens approving the financing of 25% of project costs. A review of proposals resulted in the village board selecting the Crystal Lake firm of Baxter-Woodman to provide engineering services. About this time a small group of protesters began to oppose the project on the premise that sewers in Kildeer would promote and accelerate development in and around the village. The opposition communicated with all governmental agencies in an unsuccessful attempt to gain their support. The lack of an immediate response by the village to their request for copies of 221 documents resulted in lawsuits brought against the village President, Clerk and Trustee Angelotti.

Letters to newspaper editors and circulated flyers containing inaccurate information disturbed and confused residents. A false rumor was circulated stating &quot;strings&quot; were attached to the federal funds that would require &quot;low cost&quot; housing in Kildeer. A petition was circulated to stop the project, but signers were told it was only for the purpose of gaining more detailed information from the village. Without reading the petition, many people signed. These signatures were presented to the village board as evidence Kildeer residents did not want the project to proceed. When this ruse surfaced, many people wrote to the village office correcting their position and asking their names be removed. Supporters for sewers threatened the village with legal action if they did not proceed with construction based on the will of the people determined by referendum.

Delays caused by this controversy precluded the start of engineering. The village engineer prepared a new estimate based on current escalated costs that indicated a considerable increase above the amount approved in the IEPA application. In spite of harassment by the opposition, both the Lake County Health Department and IEPA continued to support the project. The only solution for bringing costs back within the budget was to revise plans eliminating long runs of sewers to areas with minimum users. These would be installed and paid for by future developers.

On October 22, 1979, the IEPA notified Kildeer that the reduction in scope of their sewer project resulted in a lower funding priority rating and a determination could not be made when financing would be available. Kildeer had lost the 75% federal funding. On December 6, 1979, the village board voted to accept the lower priority status, and the sewer project was abandoned. This event was the single largest loss to Kildeer for any attempt to control development adjacent to its borders.

===Police department===
In 1975 Kildeer established a part-time police department. Many of the officers were Lake Zurich paramedics. With the increase in village and area population, the department was made full-time in 1988.

Killdeer kept its small municipal offices in the Village Clerk&#x27;s home. In 1989 the position of full-time Village Administrator was established. The most qualified municipal employee, the former clerk, was selected to fill the position. During her tenure, she had earned a certificate in management from the International City Management Association. The village and police offices have been housed in the lower level of her residence since 1979.

Growth in the area began to accelerate, and developers annexed their properties to neighboring communities, enlarging their borders and virtually landlocking Kildeer. Lacking the ability to offer utilities as an inducement for developers to annex to Kildeer, the village negotiated other concessions so as to expand the village limits. The village approved a subdivision called Beacon Hill, consisting of houses on smaller lots but with considerable open space in and around the development. Through this, Kildeer annexed land on the north side of Route 22, effectively being able to influence other nearby development. These homes are served by sewers connected to the Lake County sewage treatment facility.

In 1990 the village negotiated capacity in Lake Zurich&#x27;s trunkline to the Lake County sewage treatment facility. This would allow the central portion of Kildeer to have the ability to create sewer districts. Since establishing the first sewer facility plan in 1988, Kildeer has approved subdivisions designed with sewer infrastructure to accommodate future connections of upstream developments.

Over the decades, higher density developments have been established surrounding Kildeer, while it remains an island of rural countryside. The village faces new pressures, as some residents want to preserve the rural atmosphere while others prefer increased services and programs that require the need for new sources of revenue. Other nearby communities may offer urban services and municipal recreation, but Kildeer offers open space and a more self-sufficient private lifestyle.

<text>Lake Bluff (formerly Rockland) is a village in Lake County, Illinois, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 5,616.

==History==
The first settler family to claim land within the area now part of Lake Bluff arrived in 1836. They claimed 100 acres of land extending from the lake west to the Green Bay Trail. In 1849, a few residents left to seek their fortune in the California gold rush. In 1837, William and Mary Dwyer claimed the land just north of the former Central School. They opened and operated a stage coach stop and tavern along the Green Bay Trail. Some of the other early settlers were Henry and Angeline Ostrander, James Cole and William Whitnell.

In 1855, the first railroad through Lake County was completed, running from Chicago through the county line. Henry Ostrander owned the land where the depot was to be placed, and he agreed to donate the site if the depot were called &quot;Rockland.&quot; Therefore, this area, known previously as the Dwyer Settlement and Oak Hill, became Rockland, the only stop between Highland Park and Waukegan. Rockland had a post office and general store on Mawman Avenue with a small school and church located west of the tracks near Green Bay Road.

In 1875, a group of Methodist ministers led by Solomon Thatcher of River Forest purchased 100 acres of lakefront property from Ben Cloes, the youngest son of the first settlers. 
The Lake Bluff Camp Meeting Association was formed and Rockland was renamed &quot;Lake Bluff.&quot; The Association planned a resort that would provide not only religious activities but also social, cultural, educational and recreational programs. From the beginning, the Camp Meeting was successful at bringing in well-known personalities of the time, such as Frances Willard and Mrs. Rutherford B. Hayes. Summer visitors were attracted to Lake Bluff to enjoy the beach and ravines and participate in the Camp Meeting activities. A 10-acre lake in the center of town, Artesian Lake, provided additional recreational opportunities. Lake Bluff was a summer colony at the time, as most residents were seasonal.

Land was divided into 25-foot lots on which a cottage &quot;could be erected within 20 days of purchase for $250.&quot; The first hotel, the Bluff Lodge, was opened in 1876. By the mid 1880s there were more than 30 hotels and boarding houses and a large tabernacle with seating for more than 2,000 people.

Lake Bluff incorporated as a village in 1895. Charles Trusdell, the first Village President, built his home at 115 East Center Avenue. The East School opened in September 1895. In 1904, the railroad station was erected, and in 1905 the present Village Hall was built.

During the First World War, Lake Bluff was proclaimed the &quot;most patriotic small town in America&quot; for the efforts of the residents in supporting the Red Cross and purchasing an ambulance to send to France.

In the 1920s, Lake Bluff made plans to join the other North Shore suburbs in the race to attract new homes and growing families. New brick stores were added in the business block, and a large addition to East School was constructed. However, 1929 brought the Great Depression, and the plans for expansion never materialized.

==Geography==

Lake Bluff is located in the North Shore area at (42.281, -87.849).
According to the 2010 census, Lake Bluff has a total area of , of which (or 99.83%) is land and (or 0.17%) is water. It is bordered by Lake Michigan on the east, Naval Station Great Lakes to the north, Lake Forest to the south, and Libertyville to the west. The town is named for the prominent bluff overlooking Lake Michigan that extends across the eastern boundary.

Half of Lake Bluff&#x27;s land area is residential in nature, while the rest is mainly devoted to parks and recreation. Major parks include Blair Park, Ravine Park, Sunrise Park, and Artesian Park.

==Transportation==

===Road===
U.S. Route 41 passes through the western portion of the village, and directly west of Lake Bluff is Interstate 94, both highways providing access for commuters to Chicago or Milwaukee.

During the summer of 2010, a wild turkey began to inhabit the corner of Green Bay Road and Route 176, capturing the hearts of the local residents and inspiring a book called &quot;The Town Turkey.&quot; The following year, another wild turkey was spotted on Route 176.

Scranton Avenue runs through the central business district and functions as a &quot;Main Street&quot; of sorts. The local police station, fire department, and the Village Hall are located on East Center Avenue. Both roads run from the center of town to the lake.

===Rail===
Until its bankruptcy in 1962, the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee electric interurban railroad between Chicago&#x27;s &quot;Loop&quot; and Milwaukee had a stop in Lake Bluff. As of 2018, the Union Pacific Railroad (formerly the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway and later the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company) still runs through Lake Bluff. This line, part of Chicago&#x27;s Metra commuter rail agency, provides access to Chicago through Ogilvie Station and to Kenosha, Wisconsin (but no longer to Racine and Milwaukee as did the Milwaukee Division of the &quot;Northwestern&quot; in earlier times).

Although not a passenger rail line, the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway &quot;Outer Belt Line&quot; also has trackage in Lake Bluff.

==Education==

Lake Bluff East Elementary School, originally known as &quot;Lake Bluff School&quot;, was the first school in Lake Bluff. In 1963, Lake Bluff West Elementary School was built for children living in west Lake Bluff (unincorporated Knollwood). In 1967, Lake Bluff Central Elementary School was constructed for students in north Lake Bluff. In the 1970s, West School was shut down, and held many other titles, and the whole system moved from geographic centers to grade/specific attendance centers. In April 2007, a referendum passed by only 22 votes to build a new school. In a land swap with the park district, District 65 acquired land adjacent to the old Central School and gave up land adjacent to the old West School. West School was sold in May 2007 for approximately 1 million dollars, which was also the minimum bid for the property. The new Lake Bluff Elementary School (grades K-5) opened on September 28, 2009. Additions and remodeling were also made to the Lake Bluff Middle School (grades 6-8). At the Middle School part of the original &quot;Lake Bluff School&quot; is now on display. East School held its final classes through September 2009. The cost of the new Lake Bluff Elementary School was approximately $20 million and is . Lake Bluff Middle School was renovated in 2016 with two new classroom wings, a new library, cafeteria, and a Makerspace.

==Arts and culture==
Every alternating year the Lake Bluff History Museum organizes a &quot;Ghost Walk&quot; around Halloween to celebrate their haunted history. This includes group tours of the town led by residents dressed as ghouls who tell stories about creepy occurrences in the past.

Every year there are many cultural events on the Village Green including a Veterans Day flag raising ceremony, Gazebo lighting (Christmas), and a farmers&#x27; market every Friday in the summer.

Each year Lake Bluff organizes a notable parade on Independence Day sponsored by the Lake Bluff July 4 Committee with assistance from American Legion Post 510. The parade features many organizations and entertainers, including a performance by synchronized lawnmower, the local Boy Scout Troop, and various other associations from around the North Shore.

<text>Lake Forest is a city located in Lake County, Illinois, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 19,367. The city is along the shore of Lake Michigan, and is a part of the Chicago metropolitan area and the North Shore. Lake Forest was founded with Lake Forest College and was laid out as a town in 1857, a stop for travelers making their way south to Chicago. The Lake Forest City Hall, designed by Charles Sumner Frost, was completed in 1898. It originally housed the fire department, the Lake Forest Library, and city offices.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
The Potawatomi inhabited Lake County before the United States Federal Government forced them out in 1836 as part of Indian Removal of tribes to areas west of the Mississippi River.

As Lake Forest was first developed in 1857, the planners laid roads that would provide limited access to the city in an effort to prevent outside traffic and isolate the tranquil settlement from neighboring areas. Though the town is considerably more accessible today, due in part to the extensive new construction taking place further west, the much smaller neighborhood of eastern Lake Forest, near the coast of Lake Michigan, remains relatively secluded. It is one of the most scenic, historical, and architecturally significant suburbs of Chicago. These neighborhoods include estates and homes designed by distinguished architects such as Howard Van Doren Shaw, David Adler, Frank Lloyd Wright, Arthur Heun, Jerome Cerny, Henry Ives Cobb, and modernist George Fred Keck, among others. Landscape architects Frederick Law Olmsted and Jens Jensen also designed projects in Lake Forest. Market Square, designed by Howard Van Doren Shaw, was completed in 1916 as a commercial center for Lake Forest.

Lake Forest had an African-American community from very early on in its history, drawn to employment opportunities on the estates and educational institutions in the late 19th century. Unlike other communities in the area, Lake Forest had many residents who were associated with the Abolitionist movement. Lake Forest&#x27;s first mayor and a founder of Lake Forest College, Sylvester Lind, was a major figure on the Underground Railroad, and was known to help escaped slaves settle in Lake Forest. Roxana Beecher, niece of abolitionist Harriet Beecher Stowe, taught integrated school in Lake Forest. A prominent early Lake Forest businessman was Samuel Dent, an escaped slave and Union veteran who ran a livery stable. A local jazz band was named in Dent&#x27;s memory. Another black entrepreneur was Julian Matthews, who ran a bakery, restaurant, and ice cream parlor with his wife Octavia. The second police officer hired in 1900 in Lake Forest was a black man from Kentucky, Walker Sales, who was hired in 1900 and stayed on for nearly 20 years. Members of this African-American community established the African Methodist Episcopal Church as of 1866, and it stood at what is now the corner of Maplewood and Washington Road. By 1900, another black church, the First Baptist Church of Lake Forest, had opened and is still active. By the 1980s, increased housing prices had encouraged some older black residents to sell their properties lucratively, but others stayed in the community. Lake Forest also had a small community of Jews, typified by wealthy socialites such as Albert Lasker and David Adler.

The secluded style of Lake Forest was intended as a form of protection. According to the president of the Lake Forest-Lake Bluff Historical Society, the captains of industry and upper-class elite who first settled in Lake Forest sought a refuge from late 19th and early 20th-century Chicago. In their view, the city was overrun with immigrants from southern and eastern Europe who had dangerous socialist ideas and indulged in excessive alcoholic consumption.

Country clubs became important centers of social activity in Lake Forest&#x27;s early decades. The Onwentsia Club was, in the words of one writer, &quot;the premiere social and sporting club in the Midwest&quot;.

=== Growth to present day ===
Beginning in the 1950s, Lake Forest&#x27;s population increased dramatically due to an aggressive program of real estate development and annexation of surrounding areas. While city limits did not originally extend west of Green Bay Road, they gradually expanded. The neighborhood now known as &quot;West Lake Forest&quot; was started as an unincorporated community known as Everett, with many Irish farm workers, who were served by Saint Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church. This expansion was not without controversy, as many residents felt that the community was losing its character. Novelist Arthur Meeker Jr., who grew up in West Lake Forest in the early 1900s, considered moving back to his childhood community, but upon visiting in the 1950s &quot;to my dismay I found this region wasn’t really rural anymore. … The Lake Forest of my childhood had all but vanished&quot;. Everett was annexed by Lake Forest in 1926, but did not become heavily developed for several decades. In 1988, the community expanded further westward, annexing 682 acres of land surrounding Lake Forest Academy and Conway Farms Golf Club, despite negative reactions from residents. The city government justified the expansion as necessary to prevent unwanted commercial development encroaching the edges of the community.

One of Lake Forest&#x27;s most notable features is its virgin prairies and other nature preserves. In 1967, a group of 12 long-time residents of Lake Forest formed a land conservation organization, Lake Forest Open Lands Association. Its express purpose was to purchase or otherwise set aside the rapidly disappearing open spaces in the city, in the interests of preserving animal habitat, restoring ecosystems, and providing environmental education for the city&#x27;s children. In the next 38 years, the group managed to acquire more than within the city limits, which now form six nature preserves with of walking trails open to the public.

Preserved in perpetuity are wetlands, original pre-1830 prairie, woodland, and savanna, all within the community. The restoration of these lands is celebrated by an annual &quot;Bagpipes and Bonfire&quot; event in September, which started as a community event in which controlled fires were burned to clear underbrush and preserve the savannah. From an early time, the playing of bagpipes has accompanied the community gathering, as the town had numerous Scots-Irish residents in its early years. This has also been an annual fundraising event for Lake Forest Open Lands Association.

Gorton Center, which originally housed the town&#x27;s first K-8 school, is a hub for arts and culture and a community venue. Gorton presents live music, storytelling, children&#x27;s events and community events; has a film program; produces and offers classes for youth and adults, including Gorton Drama Studio, theater and acting classes for all ages; houses a children&#x27;s learning center; houses other nonprofits; provides places for others to rent for their special events and meetings. Designed, built and opened as the Central School in 1901, the original building was designed by James Gamble Rogers and remodeled in 1907 by Howard Van Doren Shaw.

The Ragdale Foundation, an artists&#x27; community and residence, is located in Lake Forest. Formerly Howard Van Doren Shaw&#x27;s summer retreat and built in 1897, the estate has accommodated the artist Sylvia Shaw Judson.

In 1992, Lake Forest gained national attention when it attempted to ban the sale of offensive music to anyone under the age of 18. City council members used existing ordinances against obscenity—defined in the codes as &quot;morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion&quot;—to buttress their campaign. Mayor Charles Clarke stated, &quot;If they sell an obscene tape to somebody underage, we will prosecute.&quot; The person who came up most frequently in discussions of obscene content was Ice-T, a rapper who has since also performed as an actor.

Lake Forest has been named a Tree City USA by the National Arbor Day Foundation in recognition of its commitment to community forest. As of 2006, Lake Forest had received this national honor for 26 years. The actor Mr. T angered town residents by cutting down more than 100 oak trees on his estate, in what is now referred to as the &quot;Lake Forest Chain Saw Massacre.&quot;

===Polo===
Lake Forest is noted in the Chicago area for its history of polo, once being the westernmost establishment of the sport in the United States. In August 1933, the Onwentsia Club of Lake Forest hosted the &quot;World Series of Polo&quot; that pitted the top polo players of the eastern and western United States against each other in a best-of-three series. Dubbed the World Series of Polo by the press, each match drew thousands of spectators to Lake Forest from Chicago and across the country. It was home to the &quot;East-West clash of 1933&quot;, in which a team of &quot;Westerners&quot; (who would today be considered Midwesterners), challenged the best of the Eastern US polo teams, winning two of three matches. Box seats sold for $5.50, and the general public was admitted for $1.10. The Chicago press covered the match extensively, including the arrival of every horse and player, the color of the horseflesh, and the color of the goalposts. The match was described as a &quot;gleaming moment in American polo, if not the very zenith of the game in this country.&quot; Today, polo is played yearly throughout August.

<text>Lake Zurich is a village in Lake County, Illinois, United States, a northwest suburb of Chicago. Per the 2020 census, the population was 19,759. The village is named after a body of water named &quot;Lake Zurich,&quot; which is completely located inside the village.

==Geography==
Lake Zurich is located at (42.192324, -88.088098), with an elevation of above sea level.

According to the 2010 census, Lake Zurich has a total area of , of which (or 94.2%) are land and (or 5.8%) are water.

==History==
The area of Lake Zurich was first settled by European descendants in the 1830s. Three early pioneers were George Ela, after whom the Ela township is named, Seth Paine, who established a number of commercial ventures in the town, and Nathan Kowitt, who accompanied them on their voyage. New England farmers moved to the area in the 1830s and 1840s, and German immigrants began to move to the area later in the middle of the 19th century. The lake now known as Lake Zurich was named Cedar Lake at the time. The village of Lake Zurich was incorporated on September 29, 1896. It remained primarily a farming community; although the village was connected to the railroad in 1910, the line was closed ten years later. However, the arrival of the highway system with Rand Road (U.S. Route 12) in 1922 and Half Day Road (Illinois Route 22) in 1927 established Lake Zurich as a convenient summer resort. The now-defunct Palatine, Lake Zurich, and Wauconda Railroad also served the community. Housing development began in the 1950s, with the population increasing throughout the latter part of the 20th century.

The town of Lake Zurich puts on an annual festival each summer, called the Alpine Fest. The Lake Zurich Lion&#x27;s Club hosted the first Alpine Fest as a way to celebrate their victories from World War II. The first-ever Alpine Fest took place in 1942 and has been a popular summer activity for families and adults of all ages.

In 1988, a historic, landmark legal case in Illinois took place settling a dispute on Lake Zurich, thereby clarifying throughout Illinois property owners&#x27; rights on private lakes. In 1988, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Beacham v. Lake Zurich Property Owners Association&quot; (123 Ill. 2d 227; 526 N.E.2d 154; 1988 Ill. LEXIS 91; 122 Ill. Dec 14, filed June 20, 1988) that each individual owner of the private (aka non-public) lake&#x27;s bottom has the legal right to recreate over the surface waters of the entire private lake. The High Court ruled that by ownership of a lake bottom land, each partial-lake-bottom owner of a private lake can not be prohibited from recreating on the surface waters that may be located above other owners&#x27; lake bottom properties. Riparian land rights were defined in Illinois.

==Eminent domain controversy==
The village government has used eminent domain to obtain properties in an attempt to increase downtown revenue via new businesses. As of 2004 Lake Zurich had acquired all the property intended to fulfill its downtown redevelopment project. While many protests occurred regularly throughout 2005 near the promenade, the protests failed to garner much attention and ended up failing. A 2007 court defeat brought the issue back into the public eye, as a village-owned rental parcel was denied eminent domain. The renters were granted the ability to stay through the end of their lease due to clerical errors made by the village&#x27;s legal and administrative employees regarding this parcel in particular.

==Demographics==


===2000 Census===
As of the census of 2000, there were 18,104 people, 5,746 households, and 4,866 families residing in the village. The population density was . There were 5,828 housing units at an average density of .

<doc id="111475" wikidata="Q1787181" url="?curid=111475" title="Libertyville, Illinois">
<text>Libertyville is a village in Libertyville Township, Lake County, Illinois, United States. It is located west of Lake Michigan, approximately 40 miles north of the Chicago Loop. As such, it is part of the United States Census Bureau&#x27;s Chicago combined statistical area (CSA). It is bordered by Gages Lake and Gurnee to the north, Vernon Hills to the south, Mundelein to the west, and Grayslake to the northwest. The eastern portions of the village border Mettawa, unincorporated Waukegan and Lake Forest, and part of Knollwood CDP. Its 2020 census population was 20,579. 

==History==

The land that is now Libertyville was the property of the Illinois River Potawatomi Indians until August 1829, when economic and resource pressures forced the tribe to sell much of their land in northern Illinois to the U.S. government for $12,000 cash, an additional $12,000 in goods, plus an annual delivery of 50 barrels of salt.

Pursuant to the treaty, the Potawatomi left their lands by the mid-1830s, and by 1835 the future Libertyville had its first recorded non-indigenous resident, George Vardin. Said to be a &quot;well-educated&quot; English immigrant with a wife and a young daughter, Vardin lived in a cabin located where the Cook Park branch of the Cook Memorial Public Library District stands today. Though he apparently moved on to the west that same year, the settlement that grew up around his cabin was initially known as Vardin&#x27;s Grove.

In 1836, during the celebrations that marked the 60th anniversary of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, the community voted to name itself Independence Grove. 1837 brought the town&#x27;s first practicing physician, Jesse Foster, followed quickly by its first lawyer, Horace Butler, for whom Butler Lake is named. The professionals needed services, so a post office opened, necessitating a third name change, because another Independence Grove existed elsewhere in the state. On April 16, 1837, the new post office was registered under the name Libertyville.

The town&#x27;s name changed again two years later to Burlington when it became the county seat of Lake County. When the county seat moved to Little Fort (now Waukegan) in 1841, the name reverted to Libertyville, without further changes.

Libertyville&#x27;s most prominent building, the Cook Mansion, was built in 1879 by Ansel Brainerd Cook, very close to the spot where Vardin&#x27;s cabin was built in the 1830s. Cook, a teacher and stonemason, became a prominent Chicago builder and politician, providing flagstones for the city&#x27;s sidewalks and taking part in rebuilding after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. The two-story Victorian mansion served as Cook&#x27;s summer home as well as the center of his horse farm, which provided animals for Chicago&#x27;s horsecar lines. The building was remodeled in 1921, when it became the town library, gaining a Colonial-style facade with a pillared portico. The building is now a museum with furnishings of the period and other relevant displays. It is operated by the Libertyville-Mundelein Historical Society.

The community expanded rapidly with a spur of the Milwaukee Road train line (now a Metra commuter line) reaching Libertyville in 1881, resulting in the incorporation of the Village of Libertyville in 1882, with John Locke its first village president.

Libertyville&#x27;s downtown area was largely destroyed by fire in 1895, and the village board mandated brick to be used for reconstruction, resulting in a village center whose architecture is substantially unified by both period and building material. The National Trust for Historic Preservation, which gave Libertyville a Great American Main Street Award, called the downtown &quot;a place with its own sense of self, where people still stroll the streets on a Saturday night, and where the tailor, the hometown bakery, and the vacuum cleaner repair shop are shoulder to shoulder with gourmet coffee vendors and a microbrewery. If it&#x27;s Thursday between 7 a.m. and 1 p.m., it&#x27;s Farmer&#x27;s Market time (June–October) on Church Street across from Cook Park -- a tradition for more than three decades.&quot;

Samuel Insull, founder of Commonwealth Edison, began purchasing land south of Libertyville in 1906. He eventually acquired , a holding that he named Hawthorn-Mellody Farms. He also bought the Chicago &amp; Milwaukee Electric line (later the Chicago, North Shore &amp; Milwaukee), which built a spur from Lake Bluff to Libertyville in 1903. When Insull was ruined by the Great Depression, parts of his estate were bought by prominent Chicagoans Adlai Stevenson and John F. Cuneo. The home Cuneo built is now the Cuneo Museum.

From 1970 until 2013, Libertyville was the resting place of the only European monarch buried on American soil, Peter II of Yugoslavia, who died in exile in Denver. On 22 January 2013, Peter II&#x27;s remains were removed from his tomb at St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Monastery and sent to Serbia in a ceremony attended by the Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Dačić, Peter&#x27;s son Alexander with his family, and Serbian Patriarch Irinej.

<text>Lincolnshire is a village in Lake County, Illinois, United States. It is a northern suburb of Chicago. Per the 2020 census, the population was 7,940. Named after Lincolnshire, England, the village was incorporated on August 5, 1957, from the unincorporated Half Day area when land was purchased to build a residential subdivision. The community underwent an aggressive era of expansion from 1983 through the 1990s. The Des Plaines River bisects the village, passing from north to south; Illinois Route 22 also divides the village into two parts, crossing the village from east to west.

Camping World, Quill Corporation, Sysmex America and Zebra Technologies are headquartered in Lincolnshire. The village is home to the public Adlai E. Stevenson High School as part of Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103. It is also home to Lincolnshire Commons, an upscale lifestyle center. The village maintains a police department and public works system; it retrieves water from the city of Highland Park, which derives its water from adjacent Lake Michigan. The village has a council–manager government and is a home-rule municipality. The mayor of Lincolnshire is Elizabeth Brandt as of 2024.

==History==

===Prior to incorporation===
The first inhabitants of what would become the village of Lincolnshire were Native American Potawatomi migrants from Canada and Wisconsin. The tribesmen left these northern places in the 16th century in search of a warmer, more temperate climate. The first Europeans to visit the area were the French Jesuit explorers Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet. Shortly after arriving in 1673 at the site of what later became Waukegan, they sailed down the Des Plaines River and made contact with the local Potawatomi, who would dominate the area by 1768. One of the Potawatomi villages that they encountered stretched along the west bank of the Des Plaines River, from what later became Illinois Route 22 south to Aptakisic Road, the first real settlement in the Lincolnshire and Half Day region.

The Lincolnshire area was originally a part of the town of Half Day, the first region settled by non-Native American peoples in Lake County. The first white settler in the Lincolnshire area was Captain Daniel Wright, who arrived in 1834. Chief Halfda allowed Wright to build his cabin at the south end of the Potawatomi village at the site of the intersection of present-day Milwaukee Avenue and Aptakisic Road. The Potawatomi tribesmen were ousted and faced relocation through the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which was ratified in 1835 and thereafter implemented.

The Half Day area experienced an economic boom with the arrival of new settlers during the two decades after Wright&#x27;s arrival. Among these pioneers were Seth Washburn, the first postmaster of the Vernon Township, who settled at the site of what later became the Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103&#x27;s Half Day Intermediate School, and Laura Sprague, the first teacher to reside in the area. By 1855, 21 years after the settling of the Half Day area by Wright, the town was a thriving community with a blacksmith&#x27;s shop, sawmill, country store, and a church. At this time, the Chicago and Milwaukee Railway connected Milwaukee to the county seat of Waukegan, and it expanded throughout the Lake County area over the next few decades; this also contributed to the town&#x27;s prosperity. Henry Ford&#x27;s invention of the automobile in the early 20th century made Half Day a more accessible destination to other communities within the Chicago metropolitan area, and the village became a popular recreation area. This prompted the opening of many businesses, including an amusement park, a race track, a bowling alley, a dance hall, and taverns, that catered to visitors.

===Incorporation and growth===
Vernon Township, which encompassed the village of Half Day, was carved up between wealthy farmers after the end of World War I. Edward Ryerson, Adlai Stevenson II, Samuel Insull, and Louis Leverone bought the majority of the territory within Vernon Township&#x27;s borders. Leverone, who had purchased the Half Day area, sold a tract of land to developer Roger Ladd and his eponymous company in 1955. The company organized a residential subdivision out of the ceded town of Half Day and christened it &quot;Lincolnshire&quot;, the precursor to the present-day village of the same name. However, life in the village was problematic, as the new subdivision was served by dirt roads and had neither a sufficient communal sanitation system nor a gas line. Lincolnshire&#x27;s police coverage was inefficient, as officers patrolling the area had to be dispatched from Waukegan, approximately to the north. As a result, the Cambridge Forest Association (CFA) was formed to lobby for improvement in the livelihoods of the people of Lincolnshire. With sponsorship from the Cambridge Forest Association, Lincolnshire was incorporated as a village on August 5, 1957. The CFA was later renamed the Lincolnshire Community Association.
Lincolnshire&#x27;s government initially adhered to a conservative and cautious approach, and refused to annex two corporate park divisions in the 1980s. Opponents to the village government&#x27;s methods, however, won out in later years; supporting a quick growth to rival the increasing affluence of surrounding villages, they oversaw the Marriott Lincolnshire Resort and Lincolnshire Corporate Center over a period of years following 1983. Lincolnshire also sought to annex the old remnants of the unincorporated community of Half Day from which it was created, but lost in a court battle with the village of Vernon Hills in 1994; the court case set the present-day border between the two villages, which lies along Route 22 up to its intersection with Milwaukee Avenue. To consolidate these new acquisitions, Lincolnshire set to work on a new village hall that was completed in 1993, and constructed a downtown area centered on the intersection of Aptakisic Road and Milwaukee Avenue; the village&#x27;s endeavors included commercial regions like the Lincolnshire Corporate Center, City Park, and the Lincolnshire Commons. These facilities were planned and constructed from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s.

In 2005, Buffalo Grove and Lincolnshire reached a boundary agreement with respect to the allocation of properties surrounding and concerning the unincorporated Prairie View area, which lay in between the two Lake County villages. The acreage in question was divided equally between the two villages.

==Geography==
Lincolnshire is located at 42°11′47″ North and 87°55′2″ West, and shares a border with the villages of Vernon Hills to the northwest, Buffalo Grove to the southwest, Bannockburn to the east, and Riverwoods to the southeast. The city of Lake Forest is located to the northeast of the village, while the unincorporated community of Prairie View borders the village directly to the west.

According to the 2010 census, Lincolnshire has a total area of , of which (or 97.99%) is land and (or 2.01%) is water.

The village of Lincolnshire is a suburb of the city of Chicago in the southern reaches of Lake County; like Chicago, Lincolnshire is located in the extreme northeastern region of the state of Illinois. The Des Plaines River meanders through the village, dividing the town in half vertically at the village hall, while Half Day Road (Illinois Route 22) splits the village in half in an east–west direction. Milwaukee Avenue (U.S. Route 45) runs in a north–south direction through Lincolnshire, into the village of Buffalo Grove to the south and Vernon Hills to the north.

Lincolnshire has been a Tree City USA every year since 1988. To maintain Lincolnshire&#x27;s foliage, the village passed the &quot;Tree Preservation Ordinance&quot;, a law that places tight restrictions on tree removal.

Lincolnshire lies on the border of two Chicago-area watersheds: one pertaining to the Des Plaines River, and the other involving the nearby north fork of the Chicago River. This situation directly relates to the presence of the Des Plaines River in the village.

===Climate===
Due to its proximity to the city, Lincolnshire&#x27;s climate shares many of the same traits as Chicago. Lincolnshire lies in a humid continental climate zone and experiences four discernible seasons. Lincolnshire receives an average of of precipitation each year.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===

==Culture and media==
The village of Lincolnshire holds an annual summer festival, mirroring the more publicized and much larger Taste of Chicago in both nomenclature and intention. The &quot;Taste of Lincolnshire&quot; features and advertises &quot;taste-size&quot; samples of local restaurants and provides local entertainment, including musicians, a raffle, and a local pet show. Since 1993, Lincolnshire has also held the Lincolnshire Art Festival a few weeks prior to the Taste of Lincolnshire; the event encourages Lake County artists to display their work to the community. As incentives for publicity, entertainment and parking are provided free of charge. Lincolnshire hosts a Fourth of July celebration annually known as &quot;Red, White, and BOOM!&quot;, a collection of activities centered on the celebration of the American Independence Day. It incorporates live music, a raffle, and a fireworks show at local Spring Lake Park into its festivities.

Lincolnshire was also home to two motion picture performers: Alison La Placa, an actress famous for her role as snobbish yuppie Linda Phillips on the sitcom &quot;Duet&quot; and its spin-off &quot;Open House&quot;, is an alumnus of Stevenson High School; and Kyle Brandt, another graduate of Stevenson, who played Philip Kiriakis on the soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and appears as himself on the reality show &quot;The Real World: Chicago&quot;.

==Sports and recreation==
Lincolnshire, despite its relatively small size, is home to nine local public parks. Spring Lake Park, which is centered on an eponymous lake and sports a small beachhead, hosts Lincolnshire&#x27;s festivities during the Fourth of July. North Park, a major sporting field and nature reserve in northeastern Lincolnshire, collaborates with Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103 to meet both the growing need for youth sports teams and extra recreational public park space; School District 103 also collaborated with the village of Lincolnshire to create an educational nature center called Rivershire Park, which is located in southeastern Lincolnshire. The nature center runs programs to educate district students and other visitors about the local ecology, alongside the natural fauna and flora of the Lake County area, and Memorial Park is a rest stop for pedestrians and cyclists traversing eastern Lincolnshire; Florsheim Nature Preserve, which sports an unusually high Floristic Quality Index rating, is shelter to endangered and threatened species of flora rarely found elsewhere in the county. Whytegate Park, an athletic complex overshadowed by nearby North Park, sports several sports courts and a fitness course, and Balzer Park is home to a short hiking trail and sports facilities. Lincolnshire&#x27;s other two parks, Bicentennial Park and Olde Mill Park, are little more than playgrounds for local children.

The Lincolnshire Marriott Resort takes up a large area of land to the west of the Des Plaines River, and has an eighteen-hole golf course that hugs Illinois Route 22 to the south; the golf course is not only available to guests, but also offers lessons to local residents. The resort is also home to the Marriott Theatre, which garnered a reputation through the acceptance of 370 Joseph Jefferson Award nominations presented throughout its history.

Four notable sportsmen have lived within the borders of the village of Lincolnshire. Andrea Jaeger, a professional tennis player known for her successful, albeit brief, career in tennis that saw progress in Wimbledon and the French Open, graduated from Adlai E. Stevenson High School; Matt O&#x27;Dwyer, a former NFL football player who played for numerous teams ranging from the New York Jets to the Green Bay Packers, was born in Lincolnshire. Robert Berland, an Olympic who won medals at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, lives in the village. New York Knicks basketball player Jalen Brunson moved to Lincolnshire in 2010 to attend Stevenson High School.

In October 2013, the Stanley Cup made its first ever-appearance in Lincolnshire and again visited the village in July 2015.

==Government==

The government of Lincolnshire is constituted as a council-manager form government with elements of home rule, which it adopted via ordinance in 1976. The village is headed by a mayor who presides over a board of six trustees at every meeting, although the daily functions of the village are carried out by a professional salaried village manager. Once elected, the mayor serves a four-year term; the elected trustees serve four-year terms that are staggered. It is the responsibility of the mayor to appoint a village manager, although the manager cannot take office until the board has approved the mayor&#x27;s choice.

Government meetings are generally conducted on the second and fourth Mondays of the month. In the case of a tie, the mayor has the casting vote. Mayors of Lincolnshire can veto propositions set forth by the board of trustees, although this move may be overridden by a two-thirds opposition vote from the board.

As of 2008, the village office holders were:

===Safety===
Lincolnshire is served by its own police department, which is based in the village hall. This police force is staffed by 27 full-time members; 24 of them are sworn police officers, and the other is a community service officer. The Lincolnshire Police Department runs an emergency center that accepts 911 calls in the region.

The Lincolnshire Police Department collaborates with Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103&#x27;s junior high school, Daniel Wright, to form a chapter of the Drug Abuse Resistance Education program. This program has graduated sixth graders from the school every year since 1991.

The village is served by the Lincolnshire-Riverwoods Fire Protection District, which employs 36 sworn full-time firefighter/paramedics. The Fire Protection District has three fire stations: one located in central Lincolnshire, slightly to the west of the village hall, one to the south in Riverwoods, and a third located on the north end of the district in Vernon Hills. The Fire Protection District runs free services and programs, including fire safety surveys of houses in the area.

Lincolnshire lies in a floodplain region, a consequence of the presence of the Des Plaines River and the proximity a fork of the Chicago River on the far east border. A third factor involves small Indian Creek, which runs north of Lincolnshire. The village participates in the National Flood Insurance Program, a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) project, to alleviate a portion of the costs of flood damage that may overtax affected village residents. The village also implements the Community Rating System, a disaster readiness plan.

==Education==

Lincolnshire has two school districts: Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103 and Adlai E. Stevenson High School District 125, although a few students living in the village also attend school in Aptakisic-Tripp Community Consolidated School District 102 in neighboring Buffalo Grove. District 103, which feeds into District 125, is home to three schools: Laura B. Sprague Elementary School (K-2), Half Day Intermediate School (3–5), and Daniel Wright Junior High School (6–8); District 125 comprises only Adlai E. Stevenson High School. Both are public school districts, funded by the government. Aside from districts 102, 103, and 125, a very small portion of Lincolnshire, located in West Deerfield Township, is served by Bannockburn School in Bannockburn, Illinois, and ultimately Deerfield High School, also in its respective village.
The first school to be built in what is now Lincolnshire was Half Day Intermediate School, which initially served all grades for the small town; it was originally a one-room schoolhouse before a major expansion project was undertaken to accommodate the district&#x27;s increasing population. Numerous changes were made to Half Day School between 1958 and 1965, but it remained too small to receive all prospective students; in 1983, Half Day School was closed, its duties were given to Laura B. Sprague Elementary School and Daniel Wright Junior High School. It was, however, reopened nine years later as Daniel Wright and Laura Sprague began to fill to capacity. Another expansion was added to Laura Sprague and h\Half Day in 2017 to accommodate the increase in students. Grade 6 was also moved to Half Day from Daniel Wright in 2017.

Lincolnshire is also served by a number of non-government-funded educational institutions. DeVry University&#x27;s Keller School of Management operates a branch in Lincolnshire, alongside the Southlakes Campus of the College of Lake County, which is located just to the north in the village of Vernon Hills. Alumni of Stevenson High School who wish to apply for the University of Illinois may do so at an extension site located in Grayslake, a village in northern Lake County. The Lincolnshire Community Nursery School, which was founded in 1973, accepts preschoolers who live in the eastern reaches of the village of Lincolnshire.

The village is home to the Vernon Area Public Library, whose district serves a large region of the Vernon Township (specifically, the villages of Lincolnshire; Buffalo Grove; and Long Grove, and portions of the village Vernon Hills). The library district also hosts a number of special events, including book talks and informational presentations.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

Lincolnshire lies on three arterial roads: Illinois Route 22, which is known as Half Day Road in this area; Milwaukee Avenue, which appears as Illinois Route 21/U.S. Route 45; and Aptakisic Road, which meets Milwaukee in the southern region of Lincolnshire. Lincolnshire shares its eastern border with the village of Bannockburn at Interstate 94 (where it is a portion of the Tri-State Tollway). Route 22 crosses the Des Plaines River before bridging Bannockburn and Lincolnshire by arching over Interstate Highway 94.

Lincolnshire has two primary bike paths that cover a large expanse of the village. One runs in a north–south direction alongside Riverwoods Road in the eastern half of the village, while the other runs in an east–west direction from the eastern half of the village, across the Des Plaines River, and to the village hall in the west side of the village. Smaller bike paths connect individual neighborhood areas within and around Lincolnshire.

O&#x27;Hare International Airport is southwest of the village of Lincolnshire. Travel between Lincolnshire and the airport is facilitated by the Tri-State Tollway, although travel by railway is also possible via the Prairie View station just west of Lincolnshire.

Pace provides bus service on multiple routes connecting Lincolnshire to Vernon Hills, Niles, and other destinations.

===Utilities===
The Village of Lincolnshire negotiated and signed an agreement with the City of Highland Park in 1982 to create a more efficient means of obtaining water by purchasing filtered water from Lake Michigan. The Village of Lincolnshire also monitors the public pumps and water meters of private residents. Lincolnshire is served by a sanitary sewer that connects to the Lake County Sewage Treatment Plant, which lies on the Des Plaines River outside the Village limits; the disposal of wastewater is left to the government of Lake County rather than the Village of Lincolnshire itself. Lincolnshire also runs a network of storm drains that run directly into the Des Plaines River; to protect the river&#x27;s cleanliness, the village government has outlawed dumping of most chemicals into the network of storm drains. A plan to repair city streets was also implemented in 1982, and continues; the Village also offers public services to clear the streets during the fall and winter from fallen leaves and snow respectively, although on its arterial roads (Illinois Routes 22, 45, and Aptakisic Road) residents are provided with bags to clear their curbs during autumn months as it is not possible for the Village to safely clear these roads of leaf debris. The Village of Lincolnshire regularly sweeps other streets within its borders.

The Village of Lincolnshire is served by LRS for waste disposal

The engineering division of Lincolnshire&#x27;s Public Works Department maintains roads and streets under the jurisdiction of Lincolnshire, inspects existing facilities, improves existing residential subdivisions, and considers the construction of new ones. The department also manages plans in case of river floods.

<text>Lindenhurst is a village in Lake County, Illinois, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 14,406. Lindenhurst lies within Lake Villa Township.

==History==

The Village of Lindenhurst lies within the Valparaiso moraine from the most recent Ice Age. The area is rich in lakes and swamp land; it was inhabited by the Potawatomi Indian tribe, who mixed agriculture with hunting and fishing. The rich soil ultimately attracted European farmers. An expedition led by Colbee Benton in the 1830s was followed by treaties by which the Potawatomi, the Sauk and the Blackhawk Tribes agreed to leave the area. Most Euro-American settlers came from the east coast, the first recorded being the Pennsylvanian Noer Potter. There were also a number of early Scottish, German and English arrivals.

Incorporation papers for Lindenhurst were filed in November 1956 with Lake County Judge Minard Hulse. The first village officials were elected in a December 1956 election, with 90% voter turnout. The village was incorporated on January 16, 1957.

The first village president was Lee R. Lewis, and meetings were held on Saturdays to accommodate the commuting members of the board and community. The first meeting was held in the home of trustee Helen Skelton. Another election – mandated by law – was held in April 1957, and Robert Randall was elected the new president. The board held fundraisers like dances to purchase such things as stationery and record books. After his first year in office, President Randall reflected on the successes: ordinances and zoning laws had been passed, roads were being graded, snow removed, and police were patrolling the village. Running water from a tower near Fairfield Road and Hawthorne Drive arrived in the late 1950s.

== Incorporation ==

=== Housing ===
The village of Lindenhurst grew out of the farm of a wealthy landowner in northern Illinois. The Ernst E. Lehmann farm, known as Lindenhurst, was acquired by developer Morton &quot;Mort&quot; Engle, who bought it from Lehmann family friend Edna Siebel. The name Lindenhurst came from the two rows of linden trees outlining the original farmhouse. Engle subdivided the farm in 1952, and in 1953, the first homes were built behind what is now Linden Plaza. Engle Homes at the time cost $12,000–$15,000, roof extra. &quot;The idyllic family homes of Lindenhurst offered the perfect solution for a home-hungry nation,&quot; states local historian Joseph Brysiewicz. In 1961, Ted Flanagan was elected mayor, and 200 houses were being built each year, under the control of Engle. After building an estimated 2,000 homes, Mort Engle sold his remaining to the U.S. Home Corporation and to the Federal Life Insurance Company and moved to Arizona. were annexed into the village, and the growth of Lindenhurst brought up school and public safety issues.

=== Education ===
The first school was completed in September 1958. Built on land from the Howard Bonner farm and redistricted from the Millburn school district to Lake Villa District 41, the school was named B.J. Hooper School after District 41 school board president and prominent Lake Villa citizen B.J. Hooper.

=== Business Development ===
Lindenhurst&#x27;s first business, Thor&#x27;s Shell, stood at the intersection of Grand Avenue and Lindenhurst Drive. By 1960, the first major commercial development in Lindenhurst was the building of Linden Plaza, featuring Slove Bakery, Village Laundry, Linden Cleaners, and Piggly Wiggly. Other businesses established in Lindenhurst included Linden Texaco, Linden Barber Shop, Ben Franklin Variety Store, and Stretch-A-Dollar Clothing Store. The Lindenhurst Civic Center built its own facility in 1961 using the remains of the original Lindenhurst Farm ice house to anchor its building. It served as a meeting place for groups and organizations, card parties, socials, polling place, wedding receptions and family reunions. A school for the old Lindenhurst farm served as Village Hall until it burned down, and the offices moved to Linden Plaza. By 1970, the village numbered 3,141 people. The village offices couldn&#x27;t be crammed into Linden Plaza any longer, and the new village hall that was built in 1974 housed office space, the mayor, the police department, the building inspector, and the village garage.

=== Public Safety ===
The Lindenhurst police force was all-volunteer at first, buying their own uniforms and using their own cars; fundraisers were held to pay for salaries and a patrol car. A full-time police position was created in 1963, and the village acquired a reputation as a &quot;speed trap&quot;, due to radar use by the police. Lindenhurst became front-page headline material on November 27, 2006, when the village&#x27;s first homicide in over nine years took place. A Burger King manager was killed in an apparent robbery at the national fast-food chain&#x27;s Lindenhurst franchise.

In 1965, the village created its first sanitary district, replacing individual septic systems with a sewer system. Streets were paved and gutters installed during this period as well. Ted Flanagan was reelected mayor in 1969 and served until 1983.

=== Community ===
Besides the village&#x27;s 25th anniversary, the 1980s brought the village, cable TV access, fast food, and a budget of $1.5 million. Lindenfest was founded by volunteers in 1983. It grew out of tents and booths set up by local clubs and organizations in the village hall parking lot. Today it has a carnival, games, contests, marathons, and music. Other additions to Lindenhurst in recent years include Victory Lakes, the Lindenhurst-Lake Villa Chamber of Commerce, and the Lindenhurst Park District.

The population in 1990 was 8,044 and is over 14,000 today. In a 1999 &quot;Lake Villa and Lindenhurst Review&quot; article, Village Administrator James Stevens said that Lindenhurst &quot;has been able to keep the small town flavor, in large part, through selective land annexation, and by carefully choosing developers for high quality but diversified housing types, including single family, town homes and condominiums. And all the housing types have to be integrated with the lakes, marshes, open space and forested areas of the village.&quot; The Lindenhurst motto is &quot;Developing Today for Tomorrow&quot;.

<text>Mettawa is a village in Lake County, Illinois, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 533. The village maintains trails for pedestrian, bicycle and equestrian usage. Five forest preserves of the Lake County Forest Preserve District are located within village boundaries.

==History==
The name of the town derived from Potawatomi chief Mettaywah, who lived in the area before signing the 1833 Treaty of Chicago and being displaced to Kansas. The traveler Colbee reported visiting the chief&#x27;s village near the Des Plaines River and eating pork, cakes fried in pork fat, and a corn and bean dish. Many Potawatomi returned to Illinois annually until the end of the nineteenth century to visit their burial grounds.

Mettawa was founded by area residents in 1960 who worked together with a common goal of protecting their rural area from encroaching commercial development. Mettawa&#x27;s first mayor was James Getz; subsequent mayors included Edward FitzSimons, Julius Abler, Barry McLean and Jess Ray. The current treasurer is Amy Weiland. Famous residents and property owners within the area now known as Mettawa have included two-time presidential nominee Adlai E. Stevenson, city planner Edward H. Bennett, and more recently, news anchor and rancher Bill Kurtis and Chicago Bears&#x27; linebacker Brian Urlacher (brother of current Mettawa Mayor Casey Urlacher) and running back Matt Forte. Stevenson&#x27;s Mettawa estate on the Des Plaines River is a designated Illinois Historic Site and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Government==
Mettawa is governed by an elected Mayor and a six-member Board of Trustees.

;Mayor
*Casey Urlacher
;Board of Trustees
*Carol Armstrong
*Denis Bohm
*Wendie Clark
*Jan Pink
*John Maier
*Tim Towne

Mettawa lacks a dedicated Village Hall and has few paid administrative staff. Village meetings are held in a local hotel, and the Village contracts with an engineer, attorney, Mettawa Open Lands Association, and various consultants for operational services. In January 2009, the Village Board established its website which serves as a virtual Village Hall, providing official information including Village contacts, official documents and maps, meeting agendas and the Comprehensive Plan.

==Conservation and recreation==
Mettawa was founded by conservationist landowners and continues to be a center of land conservation and restoration activities. The village also supports a rural, equestrian-friendly lifestyle. Some residents maintain small farming operations, and there are eight horse stables within the village&#x27;s borders.

The Mettawa Open Lands Association (MOLA) is a non-profit organization that promotes quality open space within the village and encourages the protection of public and private open lands. MOLA supports Mettawa-area residents and open lands (including unincorporated housing developments that are surrounded by village land) with public workdays and educational programs, and provides quality open space management on village properties. In celebration of Mettawa&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 2010, MOLA distributed complimentary wildflower seed packets to all village residents and to many residents in neighboring areas, and suggested that recipients plant the seeds along roadsides to help beautify the area.

MOLA maintains the Whippoorwill Farm Preserve, an open lands area owned by the village (just west of I-94 at the northwest corner of IL-60/Townline Road and Riverwoods Boulevard). Whippoorwill Farm is currently undergoing restoration to a native prairie/wetland habitat.

The Lake County Forest Preserve District maintains five forest preserves within village boundaries, including Old School, Grainger Woods, McArthur Woods, Captain Daniel Wright Woods and Adlai Stevenson Historic Home.

Mettawa also includes nine areas designated as Illinois Nature Preserves, one area within the Libertyville Township Open Space District, and the Covington Charitable Trust area (maintained by the Lake Forest Open Lands Association).

The Des Plaines River Trail runs through the western edge of Mettawa and connects with the village&#x27;s own Mettawa Trail system, which is used by pedestrians, cyclists and equestrians.

==Commercial development==
Commercial development has occurred within and adjacent to Mettawa in recent years, despite resistance by residents and the Village Board). However, an unusually high percentage of the commercial structures are green buildings which have achieved high Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) ratings. Tax revenues from businesses in Mettawa provide income to the village, which in turn provides eligible residents with a tax rebate.

HSBC completed construction of its North American headquarters in Mettawa in 2008. Although no longer corporate headquarters, the building remains partially occupied by HSBC. This building achieved LEED Gold Certification and in March 2009 was named Green Development of the Year by the National Association of Industrial and Office Properties (NAIOP).

The W. W. Grainger company&#x27;s headquarters is located on unincorporated land enclosed within Mettawa&#x27;s borders. In 2008 this building was updated to achieve its 2009 Gold LEED certification. Through the 1980s and 1990s, many residents of Mettawa opposed Grainger&#x27;s plans for office development, fearing it would compromise the village&#x27;s pastoral character. This issue was a source of significant contention during the tenure of Mayor Edward FitzSimons, who argued that fighting Grainger outright rather than negotiating could lead to unfavorable outcomes for the village. The issue ultimately led FitzSimons to resign in 1991. He was succeeded by Julius Abler, a staunch opponent of Grainger&#x27;s development plans. In spite of this, Grainger purchased of land in Mettawa (1993–1998), then disconnected from the village to become part of unincorporated Lake County. In 1996, all of this land was annexed back into the village, with the exception of the office campus. Grainger donated to the Lake County Forest Preserve District. The resulting Grainger Forest Preserve hosts an equestrian center and includes open lands filled with rare ecosystems and species. The remaining Grainger acreage is within the village and zoned residential. Major businesses are also located near the busy intersection of Interstate 94 and Illinois Route 60 in Mettawa.

==Residential development==
The village maintains a low-density five-acre zoning requirement for residential development. Most of Mettawa&#x27;s Planned Unit Developments (PUD) have included conservation easements and land restoration.

The Deerpath Farm conservation community, Mettawa&#x27;s largest () PUD, includes of restored open lands managed by the Lake Forest Open Lands Association, and also sponsors community workdays and nature education events. In 2006 it was named Development of the Year by the Lake County Stormwater Management Association for its innovative hydrology management based on wetland restoration.

Other PUDs within Mettawa include Sanctuary Estates and Mettawa Woods.

<doc id="111481" wikidata="Q1812582" url="?curid=111481" title="Mundelein, Illinois">
<text>Mundelein is a village in Lake County, Illinois, United States and a northern suburb of Chicago. Per the 2020 census, the population was 31,560, making this the fourth largest town in Lake County. The village straddles Libertyville Township and Fremont Township, and borders Grayslake, Ivanhoe, Diamond Lake, and Libertyville. The village lies 33 miles northwest of the Chicago Loop.

Mundelein was first settled by European settlers in 1835, and was incorporated in 1909 after a spur line connected the village to the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad. The University of Saint Mary of the Lake opened in 1921, and in June 1926 the village hosted the closing events of the 28th International Eucharistic Congress, bringing hundreds of thousands of people to the town. Four name changes happened throughout the village&#x27;s history, including two after incorporation.

==History==
=== Pre-incorporation ===
Native Americans of the area, such as the Potawatomi people, were trading with French trappers as early as 1650. The Potwatomi had settled on a camp on the south end of Diamond Lake. Natives lost possession of land in the area in 1836 and were forced west of the Mississippi River. Peter Shaddle was the first European settler in 1835, and built a log cabin which is now owned by University of Saint Mary of the Lake. He later sold his claim to settlers from New York.

Later settlers from England named the town &quot;Mechanics Grove&quot;, due to the settler&#x27;s occupations of millwrights, wheelwrights and carpenters. The town&#x27;s first school opened in 1837 and a church the following year.

The town name changed to &quot;Holcomb&quot; in the early 1850s, for a settler named John Holcomb. He migrated from New York in 1847 and was a civic and spiritual leader in the community through his participation in the Methodist Episcopal Church and for his service in township offices. In 1885, he donated 20 acres of land to the Wisconsin Central Railroad. In the same year, the town name was changed to Rockefeller, after American businessman William Rockefeller Jr., who was a major stockholder in the Wisconsin Central Railroad. Rockefeller was incorporated on February 1, 1909 in a referendum in anticipation of an economic boom after the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad built a spur line terminating in Rockefeller in 1904. Residents from nearby Diamond Lake, Illinois were included in the vote in order to meet the minimum resident requirements at the time, although they later withdrew from the village.

=== Post-incorporation ===

==== 1909 to 1925 ====
The village was renamed from Rockefeller to &quot;Area&quot; in July 1909. The name came from a sales technique school located in the village called Sheldon School, which had the motto of &quot;Ability, Reliability, Endurance, and Action&quot;. In 1909, Sheldon purchased of land for the construction of the school. His property contained a lake named Mud Lake, which was dammed and renamed Lake Eara. Sheldon had previously opened another business school in Chicago in 1902. Classes first began at the school in 1910, with students from Nicaragua, Australia, Mexico, and Germany. At the school&#x27;s peak, the school had over 10,000 students. Sheldon&#x27;s business failed, with the &quot;Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago&quot; suggesting that the failure was a result of World War I. Sheldon later sold his estate, which was purchased by the Archbishop of Chicago George Mundelein to open University of Saint Mary of the Lake in 1921.

On December 10, 1924, the Village Board held a special meeting with representatives from the Soo Line Railroad, who requested that the board change the village&#x27;s name to Mundelein (for the cardinal). The board voted to make the change and asked the Illinois Secretary of State to make the name change. They received permission in April 1925, and the Village Board passed an ordinance changing the village&#x27;s name to Mundelein. 
==== 28th International Eucharistic Congress ====
The closing events for the 28th International Eucharistic Congress were held in the University of Saint Mary of the Lake on June 24, 1926. Approximately half a million people came to the campus, including 10,000 nuns, 8,000 priests, 390 bishops, 64 archbishops, and 12 cardinals. Trains were used to commute people to the village every 30 minutes before mass. A temporary terminal was built to accommodate the events at the current site of Carmel High School, which existed until the Great Depression. 18,000 cars went through Mundelein on that day, and thousands of National Guard troops were sent to control traffic after the event. In total, 820 trains went through the Mundelein station from dawn to midnight on that day.

Two events were scheduled for the Seminary, a Solemn Pontifical Mass at 10:00 am, and a Procession at 2:00 pm. During the procession, a violent thunderstorm passed the seminary, leaving people at the procession &quot;tired and soaked to the skin&quot;. The seminary was left with litter and damaged lawns after the event.

==== 1929 to present ====
Floods in 1936 and 1937 severely damaged the village. The first flood occurred on September 27, 1936, after 1.33 inches of rain fell onto the village, damaging businesses. The second occurred in June 1937, flooding the village&#x27;s main road and causing further damage to adjacent neighborhoods and businesses.

By the 1970s, the community was largely residential with a little light industrial development. Ranches and tri-level houses were built in the 1950s and 1960s in the center of town, with larger, two-story houses in the village&#x27;s periphery built from the 1970s.

A major employer of the village, Ball Glass, closed in the early 1980s. The village saw economic and industrial growth during the 1990s, gaining over 10,000 residents between the 1980 and 1990 United States census.

Mundelein greatly expanded in size in 2022 with the annexation of over 700 acres of land owned by the Wirtz family; the owners of the Chicago Blackhawks. The plan was to develop 1,200 houses and 600 townhomes following the annexation.

<text>North Chicago is a city in Lake County, Illinois, United States, and a suburb of the Chicago metropolitan area. The population was 30,759 at the 2020 census making it the third-most populous city by population in the county, after Waukegan and Mundelein.

An industrial center, North Chicago is home to the Great Lakes Naval Training Center and Great Lakes Barracks Military housing. The city is also home to Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, which houses the Chicago Medical School.

==History==
Land speculators moved into the area south of what is now the city of Waukegan in the 1890s. Industrial development began almost immediately with a railroad depot being set up in 1892; most notable was the arrival of the Washburn and Moen Manufacturing Company, a major barbed wire maker.

The settlement was incorporated as a village in 1895 and as a city in 1909. In 1911, a naval training area was created, the present Great Lakes Naval Training Center, currently the only &quot;boot camp&quot; for Navy enlisted personnel after the closure of facilities in Florida, California, and Houston, MS.

A Veteran&#x27;s Administration hospital went into service in 1926. This facility was also threatened with closure in recent years but has been retained on condition of a merger with the Naval Hospital.

Historically, North Chicago was known for large populations of Eastern Europe immigrants. With the onset of the &quot;Great Migration&quot;, large numbers of African Americans arrived in the city from states such as Arkansas and Alabama, and toward the end of the 20th century, became the best known demographic group. Housing was segregated in the mid-20th century, and until as late as 1957 the African-American section of town lacked sewers and paved roads. Latinos have arrived in significant numbers, particularly from Mexico, and now form the largest racial/ethnic group in the city (36% as of 2020), just as they do in Waukegan to the north (60% in 2020). North Chicago may have over time been the most diverse and multicultural municipality in Lake County.

Companies such as Washburn and Moen played a significant role in dividing North Chicago based on ethnicity. Workers were relocated from the Worcester plant, and later on, Swedes, Finns, and other Eastern Europeans were brought in. In the northern part of North Chicago, Slovaks, who referred to the area as &quot;Kompanija,&quot; founded the Mother of God Roman Catholic Church. Moving further south, Polish residents established Holy Rosary Catholic Church, while German and Irish residents set up schools and churches in the area.

At one time, Navy personnel were a major part of the scene in North Chicago, both the &quot;swabbies&quot; (enlisted men) and the officers. Now, with the degeneration of &quot;the Strip&quot;, or entertainment district along several blocks of Sheridan Road, sailors are rarely seen north of the railroad trestle. In the fall of 2007, the city finished demolishing the buildings on Sheridan Road between Martin Luther King Drive and the railroad trestle to the north, within the framework of a new development project involving tax increment financing.

A number of movies have been filmed on the Illinois Route 137 highway through North Chicago including Groundhog Day.

==Geography==
North Chicago is located at .

According to the 2010 census, North Chicago has a total area of , of which (or 99.81%) is land and (or 0.19%) is water.

The city is situated on Lake Michigan, immediately to the south of Waukegan. Most of its territory drains directly to the lake, but the western region drains to the North Branch of the Chicago River, and ultimately, since the engineering projects of the 19th century, to the Illinois and thence to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico.

North Chicago includes a Lake County Forest Preserve unit, the Greenbelt Cultural Center and Forest Preserve.

<text>Old Mill Creek is a village in Lake County, Illinois, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 162.

==History==
In 1838 a man known by the name of Jacob Miller built a sawmill along a tributary of the Des Plaines River, of which he named Mill Creek. However, this year is debated and historians believe it could have been built between 1835 and 1840.

There were no public schools in the area until 1840. It is reported that there were nearly a dozen instructional buildings built between the mid-1800s and 1900. Although the exact date is unknown, it is believed that Browe School existed since 1859 and would remain open for 101 years until 1960. The land was then sold to a private resident.
In 1850 land was purchased in order to construct a cemetery and it would stay in place until 1883 when the remains of nearly 80 individuals were moved to their current resting place. The oldest headstone dates to 1826.

In 1873 a train station was built along the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad in the neighboring village (once another unincorporated area) of Gurnee. This over time caused the settlement to grow.

Old Mill Creek was incorporated as a village in 1959.

The village has received fire support from Wadsworth, IL since the 1960s.

The second phase involves the development and implementation of architectural standards for office building development for properties along Greenleaf Street, to include landscape standards, parking lot light standards, architectural design standards, and decorative sign standards. The third phase involves developing incentives and encouraging development along the Greenleaf Street corridor in compliance with the architectural standards.

The first phase was accomplished, and streetlights and sidewalks were installed, the lights were turned on and the sidewalks were open to the public in a ceremony that took place on November 8, 2012. The second phase was accomplished through the adoption of the Greenleaf Street Overlay Zoning District on May 21, 2009, which provides the development standards for construction on Greenleaf Street, and phase three started with the completed construction of the Lake County Branch Court Complex on Greenleaf Street. Phase three is not yet completed, and there are properties yet to be developed on the corridor.

Park City has an aggressive policy on traffic enforcement, and the police department is one of the top agencies in the issuance of traffic citations, including DUI enforcement.

==History==

While the retreating Wisconsin glacier left an attractive environment for farmers who entered western Lake County after the Black Hawk War of 1832, the numerous lakes and wet prairies there prevented easy movement to agricultural markets. Farmers traded at stagecoach trail communities such as Hainesville, often exchanging dairy products and eggs for what they could not craft on the farm.

In the 1890s, when officials of the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railroad extended a branch line from their Milwaukee–Chicago main line at Libertyville Junction (later Rondout) to Janesville, Wisconsin, western Lake County farmers gained easy access to Chicago.

Landowners near Hainesville such as Amarias M. White knew that a railroad station would increase property values. In a classic ploy, White offered the railroad free land in exchange for a station. He also drew up a town plat to show railroad officials that profitable traffic would come through his station site. White succeeded, and Round Lake, named after the nearby lake, not Hainesville, whose inhabitants failed to offer the railroad anything, became the area station on the &quot;Milwaukee Road&quot;.

White&#x27;s promise came true in 1901 when the Armour Company decided to harvest ice from Round Lake for their refrigerator car operations. They erected a massive ice storage building holding over 100,000 tons for shipment in spring and summer months.

In 1908 White and his partners acted to incorporate the station area. The proposed village population was too small to meet incorporation requirements, so area farmers were included in the village with the understanding that, once incorporation was successful, their farms would be disconnected. On January 7, 1909, Round Lake incorporated with White as village president. Soon after, those farmers who wished to disconnect were allowed to do so—an act which prevented present-day residents of the village from having any public access to their namesake lake.

A fire in 1917 destroyed the Armour operation in the village, although a dormitory housing winter ice cutters survived. Noticing vacation resorts which had sprung up around the lake, the Armour Company remodeled its dormitory into a rural summer retreat for company employees. The praise showered on the Round Lake environment by them helped bring a slow trickle of nonagricultural residential growth to the village.

With post–World War II expansion into the suburbs, Round Lake&#x27;s Armour-era reputation as a rural refuge acted as a magnet for development. People began moving into the unincorporated area around the lake and demanding municipal services. The village of Round Lake failed to make those annexations. As a result, new communities, using the words &quot;Round Lake&quot; in their corporate titles, arose. This resulted in a duplication of political hierarchies and village services which still exists.

Since the 1970s, Round Lake has embarked on an expansive annexation program. With ongoing development of those areas, Round Lake was expected to continue to grow.

Between 2000 and 2010, the village grew by 213.1%, from 5,842 to 18,289. The population growth stalled heavily in the 2010s, and Round Lake&#x27;s population in 2020 was 18,721.

==Transportation==
The Round Lake station provides Metra commuter rail service along the Milwaukee District North Line. Trains connect Round Lake to Chicago Union Station, Fox Lake station and points in between.

Pace provides bus service on Route 570 connecting Round Lake to Fox Lake, Grayslake, and other destinations.

== Notable people ==

* Clay Guida, UFC fighter; born in Round Lake

==Education==
Round Lake students attend schools in one of five different elementary and high school districts.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago operates Catholic schools. St. Joseph School is in Round Lake. The student population from circa 2016 to 2020 declined by 92. The archdiocese asked if there were interested benefactors, but the archdiocese was unsuccessful. Therefore, the archdiocese decided to close the school after spring 2020.

<text>Vernon Hills is a suburb north of Chicago, Illinois in Lake County, Illinois, United States. The population was 26,850 at the 2020 census. Vernon Hills serves as a retail hub for its surrounding area (Libertyville, Lake Forest, Mundelein, Long Grove, Lincolnshire and Buffalo Grove).

== History ==

The land that was to become Vernon Hills, founded by Richard Theodore Freese, Ron Freese, Nathan Kowitt, and Jim Carswell, began with the establishment of a farm in 1857. Use of the land remained relatively static until the 1960s, when part of it was purchased for a residential community and golf course; the development was the first use of the name &quot;Vernon Hills.&quot; On June 16, 1958, the village officially incorporated with 123 residents and 125 houses in a single subdivision built by Quinn Hogan and Barney Loeb. During these times, the village and police department were run from a local motel until 1971 when village trustees bought two portable buildings. It saw steady but slow growth until the annexing of a plot of land near the corner of IL-60 and IL-21 in 1971, which led to the building of Hawthorn Center. By 1980, the village&#x27;s population had grown to almost 10,000 residents, and by 2000, it had surpassed 20,000.

Through the 1980s and 1990s, the village grew geographically through the annexation of surrounding areas. This included land that would become the Corporate Woods business park and Centennial Crossing residential development (1986), a section of Hawthorne-Mellody Farms (1988), and part of the village of Half Day (1994).

==History==

=== 1800s ===
According to local legend, Wauconda was named after an indigenous chief whose name translated as &quot;spirit water&quot;.

Many early settlers of Wauconda came from New England and New York by covered wagon or through the Erie Canal and the Great Lakes.

Elihu Hubbard built the first log cabin on the bank of Bangs Lake in 1836. Justus Bangs, the first settler in Wauconda, built a house next to the lake in 1848 and the lake was later named after him. In 1840, members of the Winnebago tribe who did not leave the shores of the Fox River often went to the area to trade. In 1849, Wauconda was organized into a town by a vote of the people of Lake County to divide Lake County into towns. There were 1,695 votes cast and all except three were in favor of the division. The first town meeting was held on the 1st Tuesday in April 1850 where the first officers were elected and appointed. I.

Wauconda&#x27;s first school was built in 1839 and the area&#x27;s post office was moved to Wauconda on June 27, 1849, with Hazard Green becoming its first postmaster.

Elder Joel Wheeler of McHenry built the first Baptist church in Wauconda in the autumn of 1838. A Methodist church was organized on September 3, 1852, by Reverend C. French, and built in 1856 on the Commons. Both Methodists and Baptists attended prayer at the church until February 1870, when the Baptists reorganized and built a new church on October 30, 1870. A Roman Catholic church was built in 1877 and its first trustees were James S. Murray, Charles Davlin, Felix Givens, John Givens, Hugh Davlin, and Owen McMahon. Its first priest was Father O&#x27;Neil.

In 1850, Wauconda had a population of around 200 residents, and the town had three goods stores, two public houses and various mechanics.

The Village of Wauconda was incorporated on August 18, 1877.

=== 1900s ===
By the early 1900s, Wauconda was a popular resort village for Chicago residents and Bangs Lake was made suitable for beaches. The Palatine, Lake Zurich and Wauconda Railroad was completed and hauled agricultural products, delivered mail, transported local passengers, and brought vacationers and day-trippers out from Chicago. Although the railroad did not help develop Wauconda, which remained a small town, it flourished as a resort, and residents depended on it for supplies and for mail.

The railroad closed in 1920 due to lack of business. Later in the decade, Phil&#x27;s Beach was opened by Phil Froehlke and the right-of way was purchased for Route 176 (Liberty Street) through the center of town.

By the end of the 1930s, Wauconda&#x27;s population exceeded 500 residents. At the end of the 1960s, Wauconda had three elementary schools, a junior high, and a high school. By the end of the 1970s there were about 5,600 residents living in Wauconda.

Throughout the 1980s, most of the beaches on Bangs Lake gradually closed down. They were replaced by houses, townhomes, and other development. Development continued into the 1990s and 2000s as individuals from the outlying Chicago suburbs sought cheaper land. Large new subdivisions were developed north of the town center and small suburbs were established in the surrounding areas.

=== 2000s ===
In 2000, Wauconda&#x27;s population was 9,386. By 2020, it had grown to 14,084 residents.

The village completed a switch to Lake Michigan water in October 2019. This was the largest infrastructure project in village history, costing $48 million.

<text>Waukegan ( ) is the most populous city in and county seat of Lake County, Illinois, United States. Located north of Chicago, Waukegan is a satellite city within the greater Chicagoland area. As of the 2020 census, its population was 89,321, making it the seventh-most populous city within the Chicago metropolitan area and the 10th-most populous city in Illinois.

Unlike nearby wealthy North Shore suburbs, Waukegan has long been classified by the Illinois state government as overall &quot;socioeconomically distressed&quot; despite having some middle class inhabitants.

==History==
=== Founding and 19th century ===
The site of present-day Waukegan was recorded as &quot;Rivière du Vieux Fort&quot; (&quot;Old Fort River&quot;) and &quot;Wakaygagh&quot; on a 1778 map by Thomas Hutchins. By the 1820s, the French name had become &quot;Small Fort River&quot; in English, and the settlement was known as &quot;Little Fort&quot;. The name &quot;Waukegance&quot; and then &quot;Waukegan&quot; (meaning &quot;little fort&quot;; cf. Potawatomi &quot;wakaigin&quot; &quot;fort&quot; or &quot;fortress&quot;) was created by John H. Kinzie and Solomon Juneau, and the new name was adopted on March 31, 1849.

Waukegan had an abolitionist community dating to these early days. In 1853, residents commemorated the anniversary of emancipation of slaves in the British Empire with a meeting. Waukegan arguably has the distinction of being the only place where Abraham Lincoln failed to finish a speech. When he was campaigning in the town in 1860, he was interrupted by a ringing fire alarm.

During the middle of the 19th century, Waukegan was becoming an important industrial hub. Industries included ship and wagon building, flour milling, sheep raising, pork packing, and dairying. William Besley&#x27;s Waukegan Brewing Company was one of the most successful of these businesses, being able to sell beyond America. The construction of the Chicago and Milwaukee Railway through Waukegan by 1855 stimulated the growth and rapid transformation and development of the city&#x27;s industry, so much that nearly 1000 ships were visiting Waukegan harbor every year. During the 1860s, a substantial German population began to grow inside the city.

Waukegan&#x27;s development began in many ways with the arrival of industries such as United States Sugar Refinery, which opened in 1890, Washburn &amp; Moen, a barbed-wire manufacturer that prompted both labor migration and land speculation beginning in 1891, U.S. Starch Works, and Thomas Brass and Iron Works. Immigrants followed, mostly from southeastern Europe and Scandinavia, with especially large groups from Sweden, Finland, and Lithuania. The town also became home to a considerable Armenian population. One member of this community, Monoog Curezhin, even became embroiled in an aborted plot to assassinate Sultan Abdul Hamid II, reviled for his involvement in massacres of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. Curezhin lost two fingers on his right hand while testing explosives for this purpose in Waukegan in 1904.

=== 20th century ===
By the 1920s and 1930s, African Americans began to migrate to the city, mostly from the South. The town was afflicted with racial strife. In June 1920, an African-American boy allegedly hit the car of an off-duty sailor from nearby Great Lakes Naval Base with a rock, and hundreds of white sailors gathered at Sherman House, a hotel reserved for African Americans. Although newspaper reports and rumors suggested that the officer&#x27;s wife was hit with glass from the broken windshield, subsequent reports revealed that the officer was not married. The sailors called for lynchings, but were kept back by the intervention of the police.

Marines and sailors renewed their attack on the hotel several days later. The Sherman House residents fled for their lives as the military members carried torches, gasoline, and the American flag. The Waukegan police once again turned them away, but not before firing and wounding two members of the crowd. The police were not always so willing to protect Waukegan&#x27;s citizens. The chief of police and the state&#x27;s attorney in the 1920s, for example, were avowed members of the Ku Klux Klan, facts that came to light when a wrongfully convicted African-American war veteran was released from prison on appeal after 25 years. Labor unrest also occurred regularly. In 1919, a strike at the US Steel and Wire Company – which had acquired Washburn &amp; Moen – led to a call for intervention from the state militia.

Noted organized crime boss Johnny Torrio served time in Waukegan&#x27;s Lake County jail in 1925. He installed bulletproof covers on the windows of his cell at his own expense for fear of assassination attempts.

The Waukegan urban area developed independently of Chicago, before being officially incorporated into the Chicago metropolitan area during the 2000 census. This inclusion took place as a result of suburban sprawl, effectively dissolving the region&#x27;s identity as self-standing. Despite this, Waukegan has retained a distinct industrial character in contrast to many of the residential suburbs along Chicago&#x27;s North Shore. The financial disparity created by the disappearance of manufacturing from the city in part contributed to the Waukegan riot of 1966. Central to this event and the remainder of Waukegan&#x27;s 20th-century history was Robert Sabonjian, who served as mayor for 24 years, and earned the nickname the &quot;Mayor Daley of Waukegan&quot; for his personal and sometimes controversial style of politics.

===21st century===
On Sunday, May 31, 2020, a peaceful protest in reaction to the George Floyd police shooting in Minneapolis turned violent when a portion of the protesters looted and damaged local businesses along Lewis Avenue from Glen Flora Street north into the Village of Beach Park. According to local activist Ralph Peterson, who organized the earlier peaceful march moving east along Grand Avenue into the downtown area, two intoxicated locals and about five &quot;professional provocateurs&quot; not recognized by attendees attempted to incite to violence 50-75 protesters gathered at the corner of Glen Flora and North Lewis Avenue. Following the arrival of police, Peterson and Clyde McLemore, founder of the Lake County chapter of Black Lives Matter, attempted to disperse the crowd and diffuse police confrontations. Many in the dispersed and agitated crowd then began damaging and looting local businesses near Waukegan Plaza, as well as confronting arriving police with displays of violence and damage to police vehicles. The crowd size was then estimated have grown to several hundred.

Businesses from Glen Flora Avenue north to Yorkhouse Road in Beach Park suffered looting of merchandise, property damage and vandalism. In addition to the Waukegan Police Department, about 100 officers from neighboring departments and several dozen sheriff&#x27;s deputies were dispatched to the area. Mayor Sam Cunningham issued a city-wide curfew. Five county squad cars were damaged during the confrontations, and over twenty people were arrested with no injuries reported. Upon finding that the vast majority of rioters were Waukegan residents, Cunningham stated, &quot;That really hurts, that you would hurt your own block, your own store, your own business, your own neighborhood, city.&quot; The next day, local business owners and volunteers gathered to clean up the damage. Later on Monday, another protest was held at Waukegan Plaza, which was peaceful and caused no damage. On Tuesday, local faith leaders organized a vigil to denounce looting as counterproductive while demanding justice for the shooting of George Floyd. At least one attendee and long-time resident was also present at the 1966 Waukegan Riot and expressed regret that it had occurred again.

==Geography==
Waukegan is located at (42.3703140, −87.8711404). Waukegan is on the shore of Lake Michigan, about south of the border with Wisconsin and north of downtown Chicago at an elevation around above sea level. Chicago has two major streets that venture north to Waukegan, one being Sheridan Road, which extends north from Diversey Parkway in Lincoln Park. The second street is Milwaukee Avenue, which starts at the intersection of Desplaines Street and Kinzie Street in downtown Chicago.

According to the 2010 census, Waukegan has a total area of , of which , or 0.99%, is covered by water.

===Major streets===
* Skokie Highway
* Waukegan Road
* Belvidere Road
* Green Bay Road
* Grand Avenue
* Sheridan Road/Amstutz Expressway
* Lewis Avenue
* Washington Street
* Genesee Street

===Climate===
Waukegan is located within the humid continental climate zone (Köppen: &quot;Dfa&quot;) with warm to hot (and often humid) summers, and cold and snowy winters. The record high temperature is , which was set in July 1934, while the record low is , set in January 1985. Waukegan&#x27;s proximity to Lake Michigan helps cool the city throughout the year.

===Superfund sites===

Waukegan contains three Superfund sites of hazardous substances that are on the National Priorities List.

In 1975, PCBs were discovered in Waukegan Harbor sediments. Investigation revealed that during manufacturing activities at Outboard Marine Corporation (OMC), hydraulic fluids containing PCBs had been discharged through floor drains at the OMC plant, directly to Waukegan Harbor and into ditches discharging into Lake Michigan. The OMC plants were subsequently added to the National Priorities List, and was designated as one of 43 Great Lakes Areas of Concern. Cleanup of the site began in 1990, with OMC providing $20–25 million in funding. During the OMC cleanup, additional soil contaminants were found at the location of the former Waukegan Manufactured Gas and Coke Company. Soil removal was completed at the coke site in 2005, and cleanup of that soil will continue for several years.

The Johns Manville site is located north of the OMC site. In 1988, asbestos contamination found in groundwater and air prompted listing on the National Priorities List and subsequent cleanup. In 1991, the soil cover of the asbestos was completed. However, additional asbestos contamination was found outside the Johns-Manville property, which will require further cleanup.

The Yeoman Creek Landfill is a Superfund site located west of the Johns Manville site. The site operated as a landfill from 1959 to 1969. In 1970, it was discovered that the lack of a bottom liner in the landfill had allowed leachate to enter groundwater, contaminating the water with volatile organic compounds and PCBs, and releasing gases that presented an explosion hazard. All major cleanup construction activities were completed in 2005, and monitoring of local water and air continues. The book &quot;Lake Effect&quot; by Nancy Nichols gives an account of the effects of PCBs on Waukegan residents. The Johns Manville site was cited due to its high concentration of PCBs and asbestos.

==Notable people==
===Edward Hill Amet===
===Jack Benny===
Waukegan is the hometown of comedian Jack Benny (1894–1974), one of the 20th century&#x27;s most notable and enduring entertainers. Although Benny claimed for decades on his radio and television shows to have been born in Waukegan, he was actually born at Mercy Hospital in Chicago. Despite this, Benny&#x27;s affection for the town where he grew up can clearly be felt by this exchange with his wife and co-star Mary Livingstone during a conversation they had on &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; on Mother&#x27;s Day of 1950 while they were discussing the itinerary for his summer tour that year:

:Mary Livingstone: Aren&#x27;t you going to bring your show to Waukegan?
:Jack Benny: Mary, I was &quot;born&quot; in Waukegan — how can you &quot;follow&quot; that?!.

On a 1959 episode of the television game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, Benny quipped to host John Charles Daly
They say that I put Waukegan on the map. But it&#x27;s not true. Waukegan really put me on the map. That&#x27;s a fact.

Nevertheless, Benny did put Waukegan on the map for millions of his listeners, and later viewers, over the years. The community was proud of his success. The Jack Benny Middle School in Waukegan is named in his honor, which Benny said holds as the greatest thrill he had ever experienced.

A statue of Benny, dedicated in 2002, stands in downtown facing the Genesee Theater, which hosted the world premiere of his film &quot;Man about Town&quot; in 1939, with wife Mary, Dorothy Lamour, Phil Harris, Andy Devine, Don Wilson and Eddie &quot;Rochester&quot; Anderson appearing onstage.

Benny&#x27;s family lived in several places in Waukegan during his formative years there, but the house at 518 West Clayton Street is the only one of them still standing. It was designated a landmark by the town on April 17, 2006.

===Ray Bradbury===
Science-fiction author and novelist Ray Bradbury (1920–2012) was born in Waukegan. Although he moved with his family to the West Coast while still a child, many of his stories are built on his formative years in the town of Waukegan, often called Green Town in his stories, such as &quot;Dandelion Wine.&quot; The Ray Bradbury Park, located at 99 N. Park Ave. in Waukegan, is named after him.

===Otto Graham===
Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Otto Graham (1921–2003) was born and raised in Waukegan and attended nearby Northwestern University on a basketball scholarship, though football soon became his main sport. Graham played quarterback for the Cleveland Browns in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and National Football League (NFL), taking his team to league championships every year between 1946 and 1955, winning seven of them. While most of Graham&#x27;s statistical records have been surpassed in the modern era, he still holds the NFL record for career average yards gained per pass attempt, with 8.98. He also holds the record for the highest career winning percentage for an NFL starting quarterback, at 0.814. Graham is one of only two people (the other being Gene Conley) to win championships in two of the four major North American sports—1946 NBL (became NBA) and AAFC championship, plus three more AAFC and three NFL championships.

<text>Winthrop Harbor is a village in Lake County, Illinois, United States. Winthrop Harbor is considered the corner stone of Illinois. Per the 2020 census, the population was 6,705. It is located along the northern border of Illinois and is part of the Chicago metropolitan area. Winthrop Harbor is known for its North Point Marina, and is a warning demarcation point for the National Weather Service&#x27;s marine warnings for Lake Michigan. With moorage over 1,500 boats, it is the largest marina on the Great Lakes. Nearly one million visitors take advantage of the marina, its associated beaches and other recreational facilities every summer.

==History==
J. H. Van Vlissingen originally intended on developing the area in 1883, however nothing came of it. In 1899 the Winthrop Harbor and Dock Company purchased over 2,000 acres just south of the state line of Wisconsin.

In 1871 a post office was built on Sheridan Road named Spring Bluff. Not only did this spur an increase in population in the area, but it would inspire the name of the Spring Bluff Forest Preserve. Of which the state began purchasing land for in 1963.

Winthrop Harbor was incorporated as a village in 1901.

Despite the intention of the settlement to be an industrial district, the village remained mainly residential until 1989 when the North Point Marina was constructed. Until the modern day the marina is considered the pride and soul of village.

<doc id="111509" wikidata="Q113602" url="?curid=111509" title="Dixon, Illinois">
<text>Dixon is a city and the county seat of Lee County, Illinois, United States. The population was 15,274 as of the 2020 census. The city is named after founder John Dixon, who operated a rope ferry service across the Rock River, which runs through the city. The Illinois General Assembly designated Dixon as &quot;Petunia Capital of Illinois&quot; in 1999 and &quot;The Catfish Capital of Illinois&quot; in 2009.

Dixon was the boyhood home of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan. The city is also the site of the Lincoln Monument State Memorial, marking the spot where Abraham Lincoln joined the Illinois militia at Fort Dixon in 1832 during the Black Hawk War. The memorial is located on the west side of Dixon&#x27;s main north-south street, Galena Avenue (U.S. Route 52, also Illinois Route 26), north of the Rock River. The city is also the site of the Dixon Bridge Disaster of 1873, the worst road bridge disaster in American history. A marker for the disaster stands near the Lincoln Statue, on the north bank of the river.

==History==
Around 1828, Joseph Ogee, a man of mixed French and Native American descent, established a ferry and a cabin along the banks of the Rock River. In 1829, an employee of Ogee was named postmaster at the newly constructed post office. John Dixon, the eponymous founder, bought Ogee&#x27;s Ferry in the spring of 1830 and brought his family to his newly purchased establishment on April 11 of that year. Shortly after, the name of the post office was changed to Dixon&#x27;s Ferry.

On May 4, 1873, the Truesdell Bridge collapsed resulting in the deaths of 46 people. About 150-200 people were on the bridge in order to watch a baptism ceremony in the river below.

Running by Interstate 88 is a road named Bloody Gulch Road. The road is named after a murder and body disposal. On September 12, 1885, two young men walked along a county road south of Dixon, one a farm hand named Joseph M. Mosse and the other, Frank C. Thiel, a traveling salesman from Elgin, IL. The unemployed farmhand told the salesman of a place he could sell his Bibles and proceeded to take him to a farm where he had worked. As the two men passed a gulch the farmhand struck and killed the salesman with a knife and a walnut baluster he was seen carrying under his arm. He then buried the body in the culvert. The body was later discovered when cattle refused to use the underpass en route to a milking barn. An overnight rain had washed away some of the dirt exposing a limb. When the sheriff arrived to question the farm hand, since he was seen leaving Dixon with the deceased, he pretended to get a drink while throwing a watch chain taken from the salesman in the bushes. The evidence was found and the farmhand was eventually put in jail for life, while the road over the underpass began to be called Bloody Gulch Road.

In April 2012, Dixon Municipal Comptroller Rita Crundwell was indicted by a Federal Grand Jury for embezzlement. She used the embezzled funds to pay for her lavish lifestyle and what became one of the nation&#x27;s best-known quarter horse-breeding programs, among other things. Crundwell&#x27;s crimes, thought to be the most substantial municipal theft in U.S. history, impacted Dixon&#x27;s finances severely. Federal prosecutors estimated the amount embezzled at $53 million since 1990. The city sued the auditors who had failed to detect the embezzlement and the bank at which Crundwell maintained a secret account, and received $40 million in settlements. In February 2013, Crundwell was sentenced to almost 20 years in prison.

On May 16, 2018, Matthew Milby, a 19-year-old student, entered Dixon High School and fired shots during graduation practice. He was pursued by School Resource Officer Mark Dallas, of the Dixon Police Department. After firing shots at the officer, the shooter was wounded by Dallas as he returned fire. Milby was then taken into custody. There were no additional injuries. Milby was diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder and initially found unfit to stand trial. On July 14, 2022 he pleaded guilty to aggravated discharge of a firearm towards a peace officer and aggravated discharge of a firearm in a school building; he was sentenced to thirty years in prison.

===Ronald Reagan===
Dixon was the childhood home of the 40th President of the United States, Ronald Reagan. Reagan was born in nearby Tampico and moved to Dixon, aged nine. In his teen years, he lifeguarded along the banks of the Rock River. His family house is preserved at 816 South Hennepin Avenue, and authorized by Congress to become the Ronald Reagan Boyhood Home. On February 6, 1984, during his first term as president, Reagan returned to Dixon to celebrate his 73rd birthday. He toured his boyhood residence and the city held a parade in his honor.

Every summer Dixon holds the annual Petunia Festival featuring a parade, carnival (Farrow shows), country concert, fireworks show, and a 5K race—the Reagan Run. The parade features a multitude of floats from surrounding businesses, politicians, and other area groups. A carnival is also held in Dixon during this time, and the festival ends with the Fourth of July fireworks. The Downtown district has become a National Historic District. The Rock River which runs through the center of Dixon has been designated a National Waterway by the Federal Government. Dixon residents have supported a variety of large-scale projects that have created several aspects to their rural community. One aspect of this small town is that an individual can kayak the Rock River to the city&#x27;s downtown docks and join a public Yoga session on the riverfront.

The Petunia Festival was conceived after Dutch Elm Disease and highway expansion wiped out the trees along the major roads in the late 1950s. In response to the dramatic change the streetscape underwent, the Dixon Men&#x27;s Garden Club planted petunias along Galena Avenue to regain some sort of streetscape identity once again in the early 1960s. Before this annual festival, volunteers plant thousands of pink petunias along the main streets. The flowers are watered and maintained by the combined efforts of city workers and volunteers.

An iconic arch along Galena Avenue, just south of the Rock River, features the word &quot;Dixon&quot; in neon glasswork. Though commonly referred to as the Dixon Arch, the proper name for the structure is the War Memorial Arch. The Northwest Territory Historic Center is a History Research and Learning Center housed in President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s boyhood South Central School. Restored with the dedicated support of the townspeople and Reagan colleagues, the Center is proudly affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution.

<text>Paw Paw is a village in Lee County in the U.S. state of Illinois. As of the 2020 census, the village was home to 830 people, down from 870 at the 2010 census. It was settled in the mid 19th century and by 1878 the village had a railroad connection. Paw Paw is home to a house which is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places and was the recipient of a 2005 federal grant to construct a water tower.

==History==

In 1829, present-day Chicago Road was part of the Frink and Walker stagecoach line from Galena, Illinois to Chicago, though the Potawatomi Indians were the first to use the trail. The tribe didn&#x27;t turn over the area to the U.S. government until 1833. Frink and Walker also held the mail contract for the area&#x27;s settlers. The route became popular and garnered a mention in the work of writer Margaret Fuller.

Paw Paw&#x27;s first permanent resident was David A. Town in 1834, a native of Vermont, Town settled on the southeast side of a grove. The first cabin was built the next spring by Edward Butterfield on the site of Paw Paw. This first house also held the village&#x27;s first store and would eventually become the first structure in town to burn. During its earliest days, the town was sectioned off into East, West, and South Paw Paw, all of which became known as simply Paw Paw. In 1837, the village got its first postmaster, William Rodgers. Before, the nearest post office was 20 miles away in Somonauk. In 1839, a new road was constructed which allowed mail to be carried from Paw Paw to Princeton. The first stagecoach station (known as a &quot;Tavern&quot;) was built along Chicago Road and operated by Isaac Balding. Balding operated the station until the railroad came to town several years later.

Though settlement in present-day Paw Paw began during the 1830s, by 1847 there were probably no more than 50 people in the village. The name Paw Paw was derived from a nearby grove of Pawpaw trees on the edge of a forest. American general Winfield Scott is credited with being the first person of European ancestry to discover the area. The area that Paw Paw is located in was home to more than one stand of Paw Paw trees, thus more than one settlement took the name Paw Paw. To avoid confusion the townspeople renamed the village Wyoming Township. The new name came from the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania, where many of Paw Paw&#x27;s earliest settlers originated. The Wyoming Valley was the scene of a massacre during the American Revolution in which over 300 American settlers were killed by Native Americans allied with the British. Many of Paw Paw&#x27;s early settlers shared surnames with those who are listed as having been involved in the fighting and massacre.

In 1850, Wyoming Township experienced a growth spurt despite being passed over for the coveted railroad link, by this time there were several businesses and a school. By 1878, the village finally got a railroad connection, was home to two newspapers, three churches and was christened, officially, as Paw Paw. The village was officially established in 1882 and is celebrating its 125th anniversary in 2007. 

In June 1890 a cyclone destroyed much of Paw Paw, including a schoolhouse. Fourteen people were killed, including 7 in the school.

In 2005, the village received some U.S. federal government attention. On May 22 of that year, a local Queen Anne style house, the Stephen Wright House was listed in the U.S. National Register of Historic Places, it is the only property with that designation in Paw Paw. The same year the village was the recipient of a US$192,000 United States Environmental Protection Agency earmark to construct an elevated water tower.

<doc id="111514" wikidata="Q2194507" url="?curid=111514" title="Steward, Illinois">
<text>Steward is a village in Lee County, Illinois, United States. The population was 256 at the 2010 census, down from 271 in 2000.

== History ==
Steward, Illinois, was named for Wesley Steward, who in 1855 came to this area in Alto Township to settle the land owned by his father, Marcus Steward. John Grimes built the first house in Alto Township in Plum Thicket in 1847, located east on the outskirts of the village as it is today. In 1861, Mr. Steward married and built the first farm house in the location of Steward, which is still standing. The town is located in the west central part of Alto Township and the northeast part of Lee County. Mr. Steward was influential in getting the Chicago and Iowa Railroad, now known as the Burlington Northern, through the township extending from Hinckley, Illinois to Rochelle, Illinois completed in 1870. The Village Hall on Main Street is one of the oldest buildings in existence and the jail cells bought in 1903 and housed in the building are still one of the few reminders of the early days (not used). In 1872 Mr. Steward built the first elevator at the east end of Main Street run by steam. The history of the elevators in Steward over the years is a story in itself. The first house in Steward after the town&#x27;s formation is on John Street, also standing today, built in 1872.

The railroad offices and warehouse were in Wesley Steward&#x27;s barn until 1871, when the first depot was then built. It is said to have burned down in 1894. The present depot, no longer in use by the Burlington Northern and in the process of being salvaged by a group in interested citizens of the village as a historical landmark, a museum, library, and social meeting place for anyone in the community, was built in 1896. This project “The Steward Illinois Depot Project, Inc.” was being projected as a Bicentennial venture during the 1976 year. In 1902 Steward was selected as the junctional point for the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad Company as they recognized the need for a railroad to run south out of Rockford, Illinois. The Milwaukee depot and switch tower for both railroads were on the northwest edge of town.

The first businesses were a restaurant and general merchandise store built in 1871. By the early 1900s, business houses were located on both sides of Main Street with a steady growth and expansion until the depression days when the town could then gradually see a decline in the businesses. The charter for the First National Bank of Steward was signed and issued on December 18, 1902. A new building was erected and business started January 2, 1903, and continued till 1933. The first Post Office was established at Heaton August 31, 1871, and located in the Steward depot. It was relocated in Steward April 12, 1876. Today it is located in the old bank building on Main Street. By 1976, the village became mostly a residential community with the exception of the Post Office.

In 1854, the Illinois Central Railroad built a line through Hanno and constructed a depot there for passenger and freight services. A plat map from the following year lists the town&#x27;s name as being &quot;Soublette&quot; or the &quot;Town of Soublett&quot;. The town name was officially changed to &quot;Sublette&quot; by an act of the state legislature in 1857. The name is unaffiliated with the town being sublet from the railroad; it likely traces back to an Americanized spelling of the French surname Soblet.

<text>Campus is a village in Round Grove and Broughton townships, Livingston County, Illinois. The population was 149 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Campus was laid out and platted by Charles William Sheldon (1839–1911) in April 1880, along the Wabash Railroad on his farm of . The town was named &quot;Campus&quot; because the many trees reminded of a college campus. 

Sheldon was a farmer and he owned the first business in town, Campus Brick &amp; Tile Co. He later sold the company, which passed through several owners before closing in 1952. Over the years the tile company produced millions of feet of drain tile and was one of the principal industries in the town.

Thomas Feehery (1839–1926) built the first store and post office in Campus. The Chariton brothers built the second store in town. In 1896, the first hotel was built. Other businesses at that time included Ole Nelson and Thomas Connors&#x27; livery stable.

Campus had a water system by 1894. The town also had street lights, cement sidewalks, an electric light plant and tile drains, which were great improvements for such an isolated rural town in those early years.

The town had a disastrous fire in 1897 that destroyed three of the business houses. A brick building was built on the ruins. 

Sacred Heart Catholic Church was the first brick structure in the village. The Catholic Church had its start in the area in the 1870s when a small church was built in Broughton Township a mile south of Campus. The building was later moved into town. Joseph Zeller (1918–2018), Pennsylvania businessman and state legislator, was born in Campus.

The present brick building on Elm Street was begun in June 1983 and completed a year later. A rectory was built next to the church. A convent school was built in 1898 on the other side of Elm Street. The school closed in 1930 and was vacant for several years. It later served as a vocation center and home for priests.

By the 1970s the former school building had become a rooming house and laundromat. The beautiful building later became vacant and in disrepair.

In 2024 the village was awarded $1.3 million from the USDA and U.S. Representative Robin Kelly for water system improvements.

<text>Chatsworth is an incorporated town in Livingston County, Illinois, United States. The population was 1,332 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Chatsworth is located in southeastern Livingston County in northern Chatsworth Township, with a small panhandle extending north into Charlotte Township. The town limits also extend south from the town center and include a large undeveloped area in central Chatsworth Township.

U.S. Route 24 runs through the town south of the town center, leading east to Interstate 57 at Gilman and west to Interstate 55 at Chenoa.

According to the 2020 census, Chatsworth has a total area of , all land.

==History==

===Founding===

Chatsworth was laid out by Zeno Secor (1809 – 1875) and Cornelia Gilman on June 8, 1859. Both founders were from New York. Secor was a member of the Board of Directors of the company that was building the Peoria and Oquawka Railroad. He was a noted civil engineer and marine engine designer, who was involved with a number of railroads. Secor was later president of the Toledo Peoria and Western Railroad. Secor is best known for building a number of ironclad warships for the Union Navy. Cornelia Gilman was perhaps the person of that name who was the wife of Samuel Gilman, another director of the firm, and the man who gave his name to the nearby town of Gilman. The town of Chatsworth is perhaps named for Chatsworth House, the home of the Duke of Devonshire. Trains were running along the Peoria and Oquawka Railroad before the town was platted. The railroad soon became the Toledo, Peoria and Western.

===Original design===

Chatsworth was surveyed by Nelson Buck, the County Surveyor of Livingston County. However, the plan used was virtually identical to that used at Fairbury, including the street names, and very similar to that used at Gridley, El Paso and other places along the Peoria and Oquawka Railroad. This suggests that the railroad supplied the plan from which Buck worked. Like these other towns, Chatsworth was centered on a long narrow depot grounds rather than a public square. The plat of the original town was exceptionally large, covering and consisting of 42 blocks, most located north of the railroad. The early depot was on the south side of the tracks. Block 16 of the plat was not divided into lots, and 1878 was listed as the City Park. It was eventually planted with over 500 maple trees, and a pavilion was added in 1962.

===Growth===

The first building was a -story frame structure used as both a residence and store, which was built by Charles D. Brooks and Truman Brockway of New York. Brooks was the first postmaster and the first grain dealer. Early growth of the town was very rapid, and by 1870 Chatsworth had 999 people. The first hotel was the Cottage House, built by Samuel Patton. Soon a newspaper, the &quot;Plaindealer&quot;, was being published. In 1879 a second railroad, the Kankakee and Southwestern, passed through the town and was given a right of way down Second Street. In 1887 the town rendered aid in the train accident known as the Great Chatsworth Train Wreck. Telephone service came in 1883, and an electric light plant was built in 1894. In March 1924 seventy to one hundred men arrived in town to work on a paved highway, at first known as the Corn Belt Trail, which soon became Route 24 and formed an important east-west route across Illinois.

==Demographics==

<text>Cornell is a village in Livingston County, Illinois, United States. The population was 446 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The modern town of Cornell is a blending of two towns founded at almost the same time. Both were attempting to attract a station on the new Fairbury Pontiac and Northwestern Railroad, which eventually became part of the Wabash Railroad. The town of Cornell was laid out by Walter P. Cornell (April 3, 1811 – May 5, 1889) on June 15, 1871. The adjoining town of Amity was laid out two days later by Willard D. Blake (February 5, 1840 – June 1, 1875). Walter Cornell was born in Rhode Island, came to Illinois in 1837, served three years as County Treasurer, and was a director of the railroad. Blake was a farmer born in LaSalle County, Illinois, who died at the age of 35. Ironically, while the name Cornell was kept by the new town, most of the early businesses were in the Amity part of the plat. Indeed, several early houses built in Cornell were soon moved a few blocks down to the Amity part of the town. Cornell was officially organized as a town in 1873. 

The original town of Cornell was centered on a block of public land, which is today called North Park. Neither original town had a railroad ground, but a small triangular “Public Ground” was later added. South Park dates from a later addition to the town. Years ago the town had several grocery stores, a bank, four churches, a stockyard, a harness shop and a newspaper, the &quot;Cornell Journal&quot;.

==Geography==
Cornell is located in northwestern Livingston County in the northeastern part of Amity Township. Illinois Route 23 passes through the village, leading northwest to Streator and southeast to Pontiac, the Livingston county seat.

<text>Cullom is a village in Livingston County, Illinois, United States. Cullom is situated twenty miles east of Pontiac which is the county seat, and is one mile west of the Ford County line. The population was 555 at the 2010 census.
==History==
Cullom owes its beginning to the Illinois Central Railroad which reached the village in 1878. The location of the village was established by Frederick Hack who granted a 90 foot right of way across his farm and paid a cash bonus of $4000 to the railroad company. Hack platted and laid out the village and donated forty acres of land on which to build it.

The village was named for Shelby Moore Cullom, 17th governor of Illinois. The story was that Mr. Hack wanted the town called Jeffrey after the man who was roadmaster of the Illinois Central Railroad at that time. Jeffrey wanted the town called Hack but he declined the honor. The two men then compromised and called it Cullom. The governor was notified of their decision, and he sent a draft for $25, to be given to the denomination that built the first church in the village. The money was given to the Methodists which built the first church in 1880.

The main street going through the business district was then called Hack Street in honor of Mr. Hack. The first building was moved here from Chatsworth, Illinois in the fall of 1878 by John Tims. It was used for a lumber office. J. W. White and Dr. Keck arrived about the same time from Barrington, Illinois and shipped the first lumber into town with which to erect a building that was later used as a saloon.

James Righter moved a two-story frame building from Sullivan Center, Illinois which was used for a general store. Another store building was erected on Maple Street by Dr. Kay and E. K. Brown which was later known as Crosten’s Drug Store.

A post office has been in operation at Cullom since 1878. John Weinland was the first postmaster. He had a small building near the stockyards and traded hogs and grain as a sideline. He also sold building lots for Mr. Hack, some of them selling for $15.

Peter Gingry and Andrew Keck Sr. operated the first saloon and Mike Harshbarger ran a pool hall in an adjoining room. Cullom’s first train depot was a small “two by four” building which was used until a better one was moved from Kempton, Illinois on a flat car. James Fitzmaurice was the first permanent station agent. David Farmer built a brick building, known as the Cullom Hotel, on Maple Street which was used for many purposes. Some of the early businessmen rented space there to start a store before buying a building of their own. The first school in Cullom was built about 1880. It was a frame building and consisted of two rooms. The primary room on the lower floor and the intermediate grades on the upper floor.

Although Cullom was started in 1878, it was not incorporated until July 27, 1882, the charter being signed by James A. Rose, Secretary of State. Election of the village officers was held in August with the following being elected: Mayor: Jesse Hatfield; Trustees: Frederick Hack, Dr. Z. L. Kay, James Dorsey, J.W. White, A. Loubke; Clerk: W. C. Bullard.
The town was enlarged in 1901 and 1902 with the Hertlein’s addition to the south and east and Peterdorf’s addition to the west. A few years later Heckelmans addition to the east and north further enlarged the village. By the early 1900s the population of Cullom had risen to over 500. H. G. Steiman of Melvin, Illinois came to Cullom and opened the first bank called the First National Bank in 1907.

At one time Cullom had four grocery stores, five saloons, two hotels, a bank, a milliner shop, a hardware store, a drug store, a post office, a clothing store, a pool and billiard hall, a cobbler, a baker, a confectionery and ice cream parlor, a shoe store, two barbershops, a tin shop, two blacksmith shops, a glove factory, two livery barns, a cement factory, three doctors, a weekly newspaper, a tile factory, and two grain elevators.

<text>Fairbury is a city in Livingston County, Illinois, United States. The population was 3,633 at the 2020 census.

Fairbury is located on U.S. Route 24 11 miles east of Chenoa and six miles west of Forrest. It was founded in 1857. The town has a large population of members of the Apostolic Christian faith, who first settled in the area in 1864.

==History==

===Founding===
Fairbury was laid out on November 10, 1857 by Caleb L. Patton and Octave Chanute. Like most Illinois towns of the 1850s, the original town of Fairbury was centered on a depot ground. It consisted of twenty-six blocks, each divided into fourteen to sixteen lots. There was no central public square, but one was later included in Marsh&#x27;s addition. The plan used was virtually identical to that at Chatsworth, Illinois, including the street names, and the plan was similar to that at Gridley and El Paso on the same railroad.

Octave Chanute was a civil engineer employed by the new Peoria and Oquawka Railroad, which is now the Toledo, Peoria and Western Railroad. Caleb L. Patton was an early settler on the land where the town was built. Chanute, a French native, was later famed for publishing &quot;Progress in Flying Machines&quot;, which helped pioneer aviation (the Wright brothers even mentioned Chanute as a mentor to them). Chanute built the railroad that made Fairbury possible, but did so against the will of Patton, Fairbury&#x27;s first citizen.

Caleb Patton owned the land that the original town was built on and advertised lots for sale, attracting other people to live there. When Patton heard that Chanute wanted to build a railroad in the area&#x27;s general direction, he saw it as an opportunity to make use of his otherwise deserted land and struck a deal. If Chanute built his railroad through Fairbury, then Patton would give Chanute half of the town&#x27;s property.

Patton and Chanute reached an agreement, and Chanute kept up his end of the deal. Patton gave a small chunk of the land to the Baptist Church and set aside an area for the railroad and a depot. However, when Chanute reached Fairbury, he was met by a group of armed citizens. The town had passed an ordinance that no railroad would pass through Fairbury, and they advised Chanute to simply build around the town. They had even received an injunction from Pontiac, Illinois forbidding Chanute from building a railroad through the town. Alma Lewis-James, author of &quot;Stuffed Clubs and Antimacassars: Account and Tales of Early Fairbury&quot;, best describes what Chanute did next:

In 1859, John Marsh bought of land to the west of Patton&#x27;s. He donated a section of his property to the town, and it was named Marsh Park. He named another part of his addition to the town Livingston Square. It was to be used for businesses and markets. He built the Arcade Block in another section, which were a series of brick buildings connected to each other. In 1866, the Livingston Hotel was built. It was renowned for being the only hotel in Illinois with running water.

Marsh did not like the east side of Fairbury and developed his west side vigorously, creating a feud. After a devastating fire, many of the people on the east side went to work in Marsh&#x27;s west side because of all of the work opportunities over there. A new railroad was being considered, and Marsh used his power to see that it passed through only the west side of Fairbury and not through the east.

===The Most Flammable Town in the Midwest===
After the fire caused by the train, three more subsequent fires succeeded in destroying many parts of the town. All of them were around the railroad, and together they destroyed more than twenty buildings and houses. Additionally, every few nights someone would try to start a fire in a residential area, and sometimes succeeded. Fairbury became known as the most flammable town in the Midwest.
The fire era of Fairbury came to an end after the Livingston Hotel burned. Marsh blamed Amsbary for the fire, and Amsbary blamed Marsh. Both of the men filed suits against each other for arson, and then for slander. Marsh was indicted, but was found not guilty. The power that the two men held in the town quickly died down, as did the feud between the east and west sides of Fairbury. The town ceased its civil quarrel, and agreed to work with each other instead of against each other.

===McDonald&#x27;s lawsuit===
It was in this very town that a resident and restaurant owner named Ronald McDonald was in a 26-year legal battle with McDonald&#x27;s over the name of his restaurant. He ultimately prevailed and continued using his name on his restaurant despite objections by the franchise.

<doc id="111524" wikidata="Q2671811" url="?curid=111524" title="Forrest, Illinois">
<text>Forrest is a village in Livingston County, Illinois, United States. The population was 1,220 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==

Forrest is located in southeastern Livingston County in the northern part of Forrest Township, with a small area extending north into Pleasant Ridge Township.

U.S. Route 24 (Wabash Avenue) passes through the village, leading east to Interstate 57 at Gilman and west to Interstate 55 at Chenoa. Illinois Route 47 (Center Street) crosses US 24 near the village center; it leads north to Dwight and south to Gibson City.

According to the 2010 census, Forrest has a total area of , all land.

==History==

=== Founding and naming ===

Forrest was laid out on December 11, 1866, by Israel J. Krack (1816 – 1900). Krack was born in Baltimore, Maryland. Both of his parents had come from Germany. He was briefly a teacher, lived in Indiana, and came to Livingston County in 1854. Krack was a farmer, notary public, grain dealer, and in later life an insurance agent. Krack was elected to the Illinois General Assembly in 1872 and became treasurer of Livingston County in 1878. Krack Street, which parallels the railroad, was named for the town&#x27;s founder. 

When Forrest was established, the Toledo, Peoria and Western Railroad had already been in operation for almost ten years, and therefore the origin of the town is unlike Fairbury, Chatsworth, Chenoa, Gridley and El Paso, all of which were founded when the railroad was first built. Within a few years of its founding, the people of Forrest did not know the full name of the person for whom the town was named. The author of the 1878 &quot;History of Livingston County&quot; says only two things about Mr. Forrest: he was a business partner of C. L. Frost, an official of the Toledo, Peoria and Western, and that he had promised to do something for the young village and that promise was &quot;unfulfilled&quot;. The first version of the name was said to be &quot;Forestville&quot;, spelled with one &quot;r&quot;, but the &quot;Forrest&quot; spelling quickly came into use. Forrest Township was created soon after the village was founded and took its name from the village.

=== Design and commerce ===

In 1861 or 1862, before the town was platted, Israel J. Krack was operating a grain elevator at the location. Like most towns of the period, the plan of the original town of Forrest was centered on a long narrow depot grounds, which were on the north side of the tracks. The plat was for a simple grid of twenty blocks. The first house in Forrest was built by Mr. Krack, who was also the first postmaster and the first station agent. He also laid out many additions to the town. The first hotel was built by William Umberfield and was known as the Forrest House. The first mill was built by R. B. Wilson. The first church was built by the Methodists in 1868. The town grew rapidly and by 1890 had over 1,000 people. Forrest, like almost every other early town of central Illinois during this period, was built from inexpensive pine lumber brought in by the railroad from Michigan or Wisconsin. In the winter of 1868-1869 much of the business district, including one grain warehouse, was burned. It was quickly rebuilt. This was the first of many fires that plagued the new town. In 1890 a particularly devastating blaze destroyed much of downtown Forrest. Rebuilding was rapid, and by 1893 there were five hotels.

=== Introduction of the Wabash Railroad ===

The people of Forrest worked to attract a second railroad. At first there were hopes that the Chicago and Paducah Railroad could be induced to construct its tracks through the town, but this road was diverted to nearby Fairbury. Success came when the Wabash Railroad was constructed through Forrest in 1880. On May 1 of that year, the first train on the Wabash passed through Forrest. The village became an important stopping place on the Wabash line linking Chicago and Kansas City. Soon repair shops were built, and by the early 1890s over sixty men were employed here. The town became a freight shipment point for the Chicago Division of the railroad. In 1894 local workers supported a strike against the Wabash, and many of those who had supported the strike lost their jobs to strikebreakers. The Freight Division was removed to Decatur. Between 1914 and 1921 it was briefly returned to Forrest. By the 1920s the days of Forrest as a railroad center began to fade. In 1924 the state of Illinois began construction on a paved road that eventually became Route 24.

==Historical landmarks==

In the Railroad Park at Forrest are several important railroad-related remains. A surviving railroad turntable is located here. The turntable was re-painted in 2017. The park also contains the former Wabash Railroad station and a restored Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad caboose. The Wabash Railroad station is now a museum, and contains a scale model of the town as it was in its railroad heyday. The model includes a fully functional turntable and electric railroad track. The museum also contains many artifacts from the early 1900s.

<text>Odell is a village in Livingston County, Illinois, United States. The population was 1,046 at the 2010 census.

==Media==
In October 2006, Odell was featured on the USA Food Network&#x27;s &quot;Riding Old Route 66&quot;, which visited the Standard Oil station.

==Geography==
Odell is in northern Livingston County, in the northern part of Odell Township. Interstate 55 passes north and west of the village, with access from Exit 209. I-55 leads northeast to Dwight and to downtown Chicago, while to the southwest it leads to Pontiac, the Livingston county seat, and to Bloomington. Historic US 66 passes through the northwest side of the village, on a bypass predating I-55.

According to the 2010 census, Odell has a total area of , of which (or 98.58%) is land and (or 1.42%) is water.

==History==

===Founding===

Odell was laid out by Sydney S. Morgan (1823 – 1884) and Henry A. Gardner (1816 – 1875) on August 10, 1856. Both men were civil engineers who had worked on the survey and construction of what soon became the Chicago and Alton Railroad. For a time Sydney S. Morgan divided his time between Joliet and Odell, but soon settled in Odell on a permanent basis where he became the town&#x27;s chief promoter. Gardner was born in Berkshire County, Massachusetts, and had begun his railroad career working as a rodman on an extension of the Great Western Railroad in Massachusetts. He rose quickly through the ranks until he became chief engineer of the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad. Gardner came west in 1853 to work as assistant engineer to Oliver H. Lee on the Chicago and Mississippi Railroad. He purchased land near Dwight and later went on to become Chief Engineer on the Michigan Central Railroad. Gardner was never a resident of Odell.

The town was platted when it became clear that the railroad would pass through Morgan&#x27;s and Gardner&#x27;s land. The railroad was originally known as the Chicago and Mississippi, but quickly became the Chicago, Alton and St. Louis, and then the Chicago and Alton. An excursion train ran through the town on July 4, 1854, and regular service began in August 1854. Before the coming of the railroad, the land which became Odell Township was completely unsettled. Between 1852 and 1855 almost all of the land in the township was entered, and farms were rapidly developed. The land on which the town would soon be erected had been first purchased from the government by James C. Spencer and Henry A. Gardner on May 4, 1853. Through a series of quick transactions, Spencer sold his land to William H. Odell who then transferred it to Sydney S. Morgan.

===Original design===

The town was surveyed by Thomas F. Norton, deputy surveyor of Livingston County. The railroad had been granted a swath of land extending diagonally through the town. This presented a problem in town design, which was solved at Odell by aligning the entire original town with the tracks. A similar problem was presented by several towns along this railroad. Unlike the Toledo, Peoria and Western Railroad, built through Livingston County at about the same time, a standard plan with shared street names does not seem to have been used along the Chicago and Mississippi. Lots sold from twenty to thirty dollars, with twenty being more common. Where the tracks passed through the town, the land used by the railroad was widened an additional 100 yards on both sides of the tracks, to create railroad grounds, although at Odell they were not labeled as such. This kind of widening of railroad property at townsites was a common feature of railroad towns built in the 1850s and may be seen at places like Dwight, Towanda, McLean, Fairbury and Chatsworth; it became less common with later railroad towns. The depot at Odell was on the north side of the tracks and the two early elevators on the south side. The original town included 24 numbered blocks, each of which contained up to 20 lots. There was no central public square designated on the plat. The original town plan remains substantially unaltered to this day.

===Early growth===

The first sign of activity at the site of the new town was the building of a siding and a tank. For the first year the only inhabitants of the place were railroad employees who manned the station and kept water in the tank. Daniel Smith, of New York, was the first station master. Slowly a few local merchants were attracted to the townsite; some came from the now-defunct town of New Michigan in northern Livingston County. David Williams put up a shack and began to sell &quot;a few basketfuls of groceries and notions&quot;. He soon gave up and returned to New Michigan. The railroad erected a small warehouse that was rented out for use as a grocery store. The first dwelling in Odell was erected by Sydney S. Morgan for the use of Thomas Lyon. Morgan also began buying grain from local farmers. In the fall of 1857 A.A. Streator built a small hotel. In the same year a grain elevator and a school were erected. By the spring of 1858 Odell had about 100 people. On February 8, 1867, the town of Odell was officially organized.

=== Becoming a highway town ===

Early Odell was a railroad town and a grain collection point. It was surrounded by some of the richest agricultural land in the United States. By the late 1870s over a million and a half bushels of grain were being shipped from Odell. In 1877 a newspaper, the &quot;Odell Herald&quot;, was established. In May 1886 several buildings in Odell were destroyed by a powerful tornado. By 1900 there were 1,000 people in the town, and since that date its population has remained at about that number. The major change came not in population, but in transportation, as Odell made the transition from a railroad town to a highway town. In 1921 the state put under contract a highway paving project for what at first was known as the &quot;Chicago-Springfield East St. Louis Road&quot;. Paving was finished through Odell in 1922. The designation of the road was soon changed to Route 4. In 1926, what was substantially the same road became Route 66. At first all of these roads passed through the center of Odell, and by 1933 the local citizens became so frustrated by the inability of people to cross the road that they constructed a pedestrian underpass beneath the highway. In 1946 the problem was eased when a bypass was built around the town. In 1932 Patrick O&#x27;Donnell built the Standard Oil and Gasoline Station to serve traffic along the highway; this building has been carefully restored to become a popular stop for visitors touring Route 66. The station was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. In 1964 the first stage of Interstate 55 was completed past Odell. It was improved in the 1970s. This highway substantially paralleled both the earlier roads and the original route of the Chicago and Mississippi Railroad.

<text>Pontiac is a city in and the county seat of Livingston County, Illinois, United States. The population was 11,150 in the 2020 Census. The 1984 movie &quot;Grandview, U.S.A.&quot; was set in Pontiac.

==Geography==

===Location===
According to the 2010 Census, Pontiac has a total area of , of which (or 98.22%) is land and (or 1.78%) is water.

Most of the land adjacent to Pontiac is farmland.

Pontiac lies on the Vermilion River. On December 4, 1982, Pontiac had the worst flood in the town&#x27;s history, cresting at 19.16 feet, caused by a major storm. The most recent flooding occurred on January 9, 2008, cresting at 18.85 feet, the second worst in the town&#x27;s history.

===Climate===
==History==
===Slow beginnings===
Pontiac was laid out on July 27, 1837, by Henry Weed and brothers Lucius Young and Seth M. Young. A small group of people gathered at the cabin of Andrew McMillan on the banks of the Vermilion River. They intended to create a county seat for the newly established county of Livingston. The town they would design was nearly the last of hundreds of new towns laid out in Illinois between 1835 and 1837. Livingston County, created five months before, had almost no functioning government. Illinois, like the rest of the nation, was slipping into an economic depression that would cause the next decade to be called “the hungry forties&quot;. 

Moreover, the men had guaranteed a great deal in order to be granted the right to found the seat of the new county. They had agreed to donate twenty acres of land for a courthouse, another acre for a jail, and a pen for stray livestock. They had agreed to give the new county $3,000 toward erecting new buildings, to erect “a good and substantial wagon bridge&quot; across the Vermilion River, and to build a county courthouse. None had the ready cash to support such an effort. They had simply promised to do so, and their promises were guaranteed by three others: C. H. Perry, the county&#x27;s first storekeeper; James McKee, who had an interest at a mill at the new town site; and Jesse W. Fell, an Illinois legislator and Bloomington land dealer. Fell was the person who had been responsible for creating the new county. As it turned out, for the town&#x27;s three founders, the future of Pontiac would not be their problem. Within five weeks of the founding of the town, both Young brothers would be dead, and Henry Weed soon drifted away and would die of pneumonia in 1842 while working on a railroad near Binghamton, New York. The men who founded Pontiac would not be its developers.

===The design of Pontiac===
The design of the original town was typical of Midwestern town plats in the 1830s. Since there were neither improved roads nor railroads, the plan was centered on a town square; such squares would become much less common after the arrival of railroads. In these early towns, the public square served to define the town center and therefore to establish the location of the highest value lots. Isaac Wicher, the County Surveyor, made the initial survey of Pontiac and staked out its streets and lots. Pontiac was the only town laid out in Livingston County in the 1830s, but similar square-centered towns from that time can be found at Metamora, Lexington, Danvers, Clinton, and Le Roy, all established within two years of Pontiac. The original Town of Pontiac differed somewhat from these others because it was unusually large, with ninety-three blocks, most divided into eight lots with some left unsubdivided. The new town extended on both sides of the river. The square, where the courthouse would be built, was bounded by Washington, Madison, Main and Mill Streets. At first, lots were sold for as little as five dollars each and, even as late as 1850, good lots could be had for as little as twenty dollars each.

===Naming and first attempt to take away the county seat===
Jesse W. Fell had been asked to use his influence to establish a post office in the area. In order to do this, he needed a name and selected “Pontiac” in honor of the Native American leader, who as far anyone knew had never set foot in the area that would be Livingston County. Fell had also selected the name of Livingston County. The town did have a few advantages. It was a good place to cross the river, there was a good mill seat, and James McKee was working to establish a sawmill on the Vermilion river at the town site. By 1838, the mill was in operation. Before leaving the county, Seth Weed had built the first house in Pontiac.

After the Young brothers&#x27; deaths, Isaac Fellows came west to settle their estate. He liked the location and took up residence. Work started on the courthouse, but was behind schedule. Early growth was so slow that rivals decided there was a good chance they could strip the honor and the business of the county seat from Pontiac. In 1839 they forced the matter to a vote. The proprietors of Pontiac, they argued, had not lived up to their obligations: the courthouse was unfinished and no bridge across the Vermilion had been built. Their new suggestion for the seat of Government of Livingston County, four or five miles upstream would, they said, be more centrally located. They complained that the site of Pontiac had been poorly chosen and was low, damp, and generally unhealthy. The people of the county agreed. By a margin of 81 to 56, they voted to move the county seat but a two-thirds majority was needed to relocate a county seat. As a two-thirds majority failed by a small margin, Pontiac was continued to be the location of the county offices. After considerable delay, the first Courthouse, a twenty-two by thirty-foot wooden building, was finished and, in 1847, the promised bridge across the Vermilion was completed. Shortly after the $450 bridge was opened, a sudden rise in the Vermilion river swept it away.

===Second attempt to displace Pontiac===
The 1878 History of Livingston County remarked, “the town of Pontiac was little more than a name.” In the early 1840s it had only a half-dozen cabins and an unfinished courthouse, and everything was so scattered among “clumps of bushes” that the town was almost invisible. In 1848, August Fellows, who now owned much of the town, had managed to set up a hostelry. Some of the first church services in Pontiac were held at the tavern. In 1849 cholera swept through Pontiac, killing Fellows and two of his children. One early settler remembered that in Livingston County one person in two suffered from the disease. Fellow&#x27;s widow, Maria Tracey Fellows, continued to run the hotel; she remarried Nelson Buck in 1850 and renamed the place Buck Hotel.

In 1851, there was a second attempt to displace Pontiac. On June 23, 1851, a town called Richmond was platted two miles east of Pontiac. Its backers included powerful local business and political figures. These men had calculated that the new Chicago and Mississippi Railroad would miss Pontiac and cross the Vermilion River at their location. Stores, shops, and a schoolhouse were built at Richmond. However, the Richmond speculators had not reckoned with Jesse W. Fell, who had retained a strong economic and social interest in Pontiac and had important friends among the railroad officials. The tracks missed Richmond and passed through Pontiac, with the station located in Fell&#x27;s First Addition to the town. Richmond was quickly abandoned; some of its buildings were moved to Pontiac. On July 4, 1854, an exhibition train steamed into Pontiac, and a few months later regular service on the railroad, soon to be known as the Chicago and Alton, began.

===Years of rapid growth===
Pontiac became a boom town. People flooded in and money for improvements was available. In 1856, Pontiac was incorporated. By 1866, the people of Livingston County could afford to spend $18,000 to construct a new stone jail in Pontiac. In 1870, the state established the Reform School at Pontiac. It was to be a model correctional institution for boys. Jesse W. Fell donated sixty-four acres, valued at $10,000, and more land was purchased. Livingston County issued $50,000 in bonds. The town of Pontiac added another $25,000 in bonds, and the first buildings were constructed. In 1892, this facility became the Illinois State Reformatory and is now the Pontiac Correctional Center.

In 1870, a fire destroyed $50,000 worth of buildings in downtown Pontiac and, like many Illinois towns, the town fathers, spurred on by insurance companies, created a “fire district,” a zone in the commercial part of the city where buildings had to be constructed of brick or some other fireproof material. These districts make Pontiac a classic example of one of the key visual features of the American Midwest: towns with brick commercial districts surrounded by wooden residences. Rebuilding was rapid, and growth continued. In 1871, The Chicago and Paducah Railroad was built with the aid of local bonds. The new railroad had revenues of $21,600 by 1877, while the older Chicago and Alton Railroad was handling $61,578 worth of goods. A second and larger courthouse was built. During Independence Day celebrations on July 4, 1874, stray fireworks started a blaze which burned the courthouse, the Union Block, and the Phoenix Block. Undaunted, Livingston County set out to find the best possible architect to design a new and more splendid building. They settled on John C. Cochrane, known for his work on the Capitol building in Springfield and for the Richland County courthouse. The building was finished in 1875 and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.

===Continued growth===
By 1880, improvements continued at a rapid pace, which included the installation of the first electric lights in 1882. In 1891, the wooden bridge over the Vermilion river was replaced by an iron span. Pontiac built a municipal water works in 1892. Between 1875 and 1900, new buildings were erected around the courthouse square.

Abraham Lincoln visited Pontiac in the 1840s and again in February 1855, when his train was snowbound on the nearby tracks, and he was taken by sled to spend the night at the home of Mr. John McGregor. On January 25, 1860, Lincoln was again in town when he addressed the Young Men&#x27;s Literary Association. In 1858, Stephen A. Douglas and Owen Lovejoy, the abolitionist, both visited Pontiac. When local people learned in 1880 that former president Ulysses S. Grant would pass through Pontiac on his way to visit his son, they begged the general to stay over for breakfast, and a large reception committee quickly arranged a celebration. William Jennings Bryan came to Pontiac on October 27, 1896 and returned on several other occasions. On June 3, 1903, during his whistle stop tour through Central Illinois, Theodore Roosevelt spoke in Pontiac and unveiled the soldier&#x27;s monument. He spoke there again in 1910.

===Automobile age===
In the American Midwest, new highways often parallel early railroads. This happened at Pontiac. The Chicago Mississippi, linking St. Louis with Chicago, was Pontiac&#x27;s first railroad. In 1922 and 1923, Route 4, the first paved highway between Chicago and St. Louis, followed almost exactly the same route as the railroad. Local people called it the ‘hard road.” The new state highway passed along Ladd Street and brought traffic through the center of Pontiac. The 1891 iron truss bridge over the Vermilion proved inadequate to carry increased traffic over the river, and in 1925 it was replaced with a steel and concrete structure. Also in 1925, the designation of the road was changed to Route 66, but this was only a change in name, as most of this famous highway simply borrowed the pavement of Route 4.

The Threshermen&#x27;s Reunion started in a modest way in 1949 at Pontiac&#x27;s Chautauqua Park next to the Vermilion River as a gathering of interested people who brought together a collection of old farm machinery. The assemblage of steam engines and the people who ran them grew in popularity. In 1999, the sponsors purchased their own forty acres north of town.

The first phase of construction on Interstate 55 was finished in 1966, and in the early 1970s the road, which closely followed Route 66, was brought up to improved federal standards. Highway-oriented businesses soon clustered around these roads, at first on the north and south sides of Pontiac, and later near Exit 197, west of the old town center. Unlike many towns, Pontiac has continued to be serviced by railroad passenger service. In 1971, Amtrak took over the task of moving people between Chicago and St. Louis, and Pontiac has continued to be a stop.

Pontiac is home to the Illinois Route 66 Hall of Fame. It was previously located at Dixie Truckers Home in McLean, Illinois, but it was moved to a new, larger location in Pontiac when Dixie changed ownership.

==History==

===Founding and design of Strawn===

Strawn was laid out on June 6, 1873, by David Strawn (October 1, 1818 – September 25, 1873). David Strawn had moved to La Salle County, Illinois, with his family in 1830 from Preble County, Ohio, and in 1835 had settled in South Ottawa Township. He had been elected to the Illinois General Assembly and, by the time the Town of Strawn was platted, he had become a very wealthy land owner. In addition to his La Salle County holdings, Strawn owned thousands of acres in Livingston County. David Strawn never lived in the town that had been named in his honor. The Chicago and Paducah Railroad was at that time being built through Fayette Township in Livingston County. Alfred C. Hueston, the Livingston County Surveyor, laid out the town. He staked out ten blocks on the west side of the tracks, each divided into nine to twenty-four lots. The town was aligned with the railroad tracks rather than in true compass directions. Strawn was unusual because it was designed with a Public Square, a feature common in Illinois towns of the 1830s, but much less so in Illinois towns of the 1870s. Hueston also included a square in his design of the Livingston County town of Cornell, laid out in 1871. There was a Depot Ground near the tracks and the station was on the west side of the tracks.

===Early events in Strawn===
In an effort to attract people to the town, Strawn decided that every alternate lot would be offered free of charge to anyone who would erect a house. The houses had to be of a specified size and they had to be finished quickly; Strawn was emphatic that he did not want &quot;shanties&quot; either as homes or as places of business. E. H. Roberts bought the first lot on the first day they were offered for sale. Many doubted Strawn would be a success.

John Colfer built the first house in Strawn; it was soon converted into a hotel. Roberts also had the distinction of being partner in Aaron, Roberts and Company, the firm that sold the first goods in the town. By 1878 Strawn had eight stores, a harness shop, a blacksmith shop, shoe shops, a grain business and a saloon. A Post Office was established in 1873. On July 1, 1873, the railroad station opened for business. On that day, the first item shipped into Strawn arrived: a barrel of meat bound for the boarding house operated by S.K. Mitchell. Six days later the first freight shipped out of town was sent off: a carload of hogs loaded by Walter D. Strawn, son of the town&#x27;s founder, who was operating a nearby farm. The first school in Strawn was taught by Sarah Hanagan in the summer of 1873. The Railroad eventually became part of the Wabash system later on the Bloomer Line. Soon after its founding the population of Strawn grew rapidly, but this growth was not sustained.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2010, there were 100 people, 40 households, and 25 families residing in the village; there were 46 housing units.

<text>Broadwell is a village in Logan County, Illinois, United States. The population was 136 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Broadwell is located in southwestern Logan County. Interstate 55 passes through the western side of the village, with access from Exit 119. I-55 leads northeast to Lincoln, the county seat, and to Bloomington, while to the southwest it leads to Springfield, the state capital.

According to the 2010 census, Broadwell has a total area of , all land.

== History ==
The village of Broadwell was platted in 1856 by William Broadwell and Jacob Eisiminger, which occurred in conjunction with the construction of the railroad linking Chicago and Springfield.

Prior to the plat of the village, there was an inn three-quarters of a mile east of the present site, called &quot;Tantivy&quot; or &quot;TAN-TI-VY&quot;. The name apparently derives from an old English hunting cry. Tantivy Lodge was in existence from about 1840 through the early 1950s; tradition states that Abraham Lincoln stopped there while traveling from Springfield to the Logan County courthouse at Postville (today a part of the newer city of Lincoln, Illinois) while Lincoln rode the judicial circuit as a lawyer. It is recorded (with greater certainty) that the (later) central Illinois cattle and land baron, John Dean Gillett, proposed marriage to his future wife, Lemira Parke, at the Tantivy cabin c. 1840. It is likely that Tantivy was relocated by about one-eighth of a mile (from east to west) at least once during its existence.

When Jacob Eisiminger was offered the honor of having the village named after him, he declined, stating that the new village would be handicapped with such an unusual name; accordingly, it was named Broadwell. William Broadwell (of Springfield) owned the original land, but had very little further connection with the village, and he later moved to Kansas; the Eisiminger family, however, were long-time merchants, postmasters and schoolteachers in the village. Leola Eisiminger, the last member of the family bearing this name, died on August 16, 2005.

Broadwell became a shipping point for hogs, corn, wheat and later soybeans. The village and township has never known any great period of economic boom or bust. The surrounding Broadwell Township features some of the finest productive agricultural soils in North America.

The village was located directly on historic U.S. Route 66, from 1926 to 1978; today the limited-access Interstate 55 is located on the western edge of the village. There is a full interstate exit for the village and township. The former northbound lane of U.S. Route 66 remains intact, and it still serves the village as a major local road and tourist magnet.

Broadwell featured the well-known &quot;Pig Hip&quot; Restaurant, operated by Ernest L. (&quot;Ernie&quot;) Edwards and family from 1937 through 1991. Edwards recently received the citation for &quot;The BEST U.S. Route 66 attraction where the ORIGINAL GUY is still there&quot;. Until recently, the Pig Hip building was still open as a museum of Route 66 memorabilia, with Ernie Edwards (born August 5, 1917) as the host. The restaurant/museum and most of its contents were destroyed by fire on March 5, 2007. Ernie operated a small museum from his adjacent residence until late 2010, and he died in nearby Lincoln on April 11, 2012. He retained his wits and memory to the very end of life, and was a fount of Route 66 stories and information. On June 9, 1990, Ernie became an inaugural inductee into the Route 66 Hall of Fame of Illinois.

A bronze and stone memorial dedicated to the Pig Hip Restaurant and to U.S. Route 66 was unveiled by Ernie Edwards on August 5, 2007. The large boulder and bronze marker were presented to Ernie by his family, friends, and neighbors on the occasion of his 90th birthday.

The village and township of Broadwell sent two of its native sons to the Illinois General Assembly during the late twentieth century. John R. (&quot;Jack&quot;) Lauer served as state representative from 1973 to 1978, and Robert F. (&quot;Bob&quot;) Olson served as state representative from 1986 to 1994. Both men farmed locally for many years.

==History==

Elkhart takes its name from Elkhart (or &quot;Elk Heart&quot;) Grove, which along with Buffalo Hart was an area of woodland along the Edwards Trace. The grove&#x27;s name has been attributed to its shape, resembling the heart of an elk. Prior to the forced expulsion of indigenous peoples from Illinois, a Kickapoo village was located at the grove.

The history of non-indigenous settlement at Elkhart dates from the arrival of James Latham and his family at Elkhart Grove in the spring of 1819. James Latham&#x27;s house, and later his son Richard Latham&#x27;s place on the brow of the hill further south, were stops on the early stage routes from Springfield to Bloomington. Around 1822, James and Richard Latham built a horse mill at the foot of Elkhart Hill. Before this, the early settlers had been compelled to go to Edwardsville to mill. During the mill&#x27;s existence, settlers came a great distance to get their grinding done and frequently camped overnight waiting their turn.

In later days, Abraham Lincoln, David Davis, John T. Stuart and others frequently spent the night at Elkhart Grove when traveling the 8th Judicial Circuit.

A town site at Elkhart Grove had been laid out by early settler Aquilla Davis in the 1820s. However, nothing definite was done in that direction until the Alton &amp; Sangamon (now the Chicago &amp; Alton) railroad came through in 1853. Once the tracks were laid, an old horse mill, owned by Seneca Woods, was brought from Springfield by William Mozee and converted into a warehouse. This was the first building in the town of Elkhart. In 1855, John Shockey, of Franklin County, Pennsylvania, laid out the town, and County Surveyor Conaway Pence surveyed it on April 11 of that year. The town was given the name of Elkhart City to distinguish it from the nearby locations of Elkhart Hill and Elkhart Grove.

Also in 1855, John Shockey erected a large frame hotel. J. R. Saunders also built a brick store and offered the first general stock of goods for sale in the town. A few goods had been for sale in the old warehouse, but no regular stock had been kept. Quite a number of houses were built that same summer, and the town experienced quite a growth spurt during the later 1850s. The Elkhart City post office was established in 1856. J. R. Saunders served as the first postmaster and railroad agent, and William Rankin was his assistant. In 1858, John Gibbs erected a warehouse. Shockey&#x27;s addition was added to the original town in January 1858. Rigney&#x27;s addition was laid out in 1863, and Thompson&#x27;s addition was added in 1865. A small district school house was moved into the town in 1856, which gave way to a larger structure in 1865.

For many years Elkhart was one of the largest shipping points on the Chicago &amp; Alton Railroad. This was due in part to the large stock farms of John D. Gillett. The town was incorporated February 22, 1861, by special legislative charter. The first officers were James Rigney, president; W. M. Helm, clerk; T. H. Cantrall, treasurer; L. D. Dana, justice; Martin Buzzard, constable; and A. H. Bogardus, street commissioner. A Methodist church was built in the village in 1863, a Catholic church in 1864, and a Christian church in 1867.

The name of the post office was changed from Elkhart City to Elkhart in 1883. A new rail depot was built at Elkhart in 1888.

Like many frontier towns, Elkhart had its share of fires. The nearby residence of the rancher John D. Gillett was destroyed by fire on February 14, 1871, although he rebuilt on the same site. On May 24, 1889, lightning struck the Crang Building, which was occupied by the Hughes &amp; Mendenhall General Store. The fire spread to adjacent buildings and destroyed most of Elkhart&#x27;s commercial buildings, wiping out ten businesses and one home.On March 2, 1891, Governor Richard J. Oglesby&#x27;s residence was consumed by fire. A new residence was erected by Gov. Oglesby but on a site further to the south and east, now known as Oglehurst. Gov. Oglesby died in this home on April 24, 1899.

In 1885, the town was incorporated as a village under the general laws of the state, relinquishing the special legislative charter. The first board under the new incorporation consisted of Henry Stahl, C. P. Bridges, A. H. Bogardus, C. B. Taylor, David Lippott and Luther Wood. A new library building was erected in 1904, the gift of the Gillett family.

Elkhart was a station on the Illinois Traction System, an interurban railroad providing passenger service between Peoria and St. Louis that was built through the village in 1904. It continued in service until the 1950s.

<text>Lincoln is a city in Logan County, Illinois, United States. First settled in the 1830s, it is the only town in the U.S. that was named for Abraham Lincoln before he became president; he practiced law there from 1847 to 1859. Lincoln is home to two prisons. It is also the home of the world&#x27;s largest covered wagon and numerous other historical sites along the Route 66 corridor.

The population was 13,288 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Logan County.

==History==
The town&#x27;s standard history holds that it was officially named on August 27, 1853, in an unusual ceremony. Abraham Lincoln, having assisted with the platting of the town and working as counsel for the newly laid Chicago &amp; Mississippi Railroad which led to its founding, was asked to participate in a naming ceremony for the town. On this date, the first sale of lots took place in the new town. Ninety were sold at prices ranging from $40 to $150. According to tradition Lincoln was present. At noon he purchased two watermelons and carried one under each arm to the public square. There he invited Latham, Hickox, and Gillette, proprietors, to join him, saying, &quot;Now we&#x27;ll christen the new town,&quot; squeezing watermelon juice out on the ground. Legend has it that when it had been proposed to him that the town be named for him, he had advised against it, saying that in his experience, &quot;Nothing bearing the name of Lincoln ever amounted to much.&quot; The town of Lincoln was the first city named after Abraham Lincoln, while he was a lawyer and before he was President of the United States.

Despite that story, newspaper reports make it clear that the city&#x27;s name of Lincoln had been chosen at least several weeks before the August 27 date. The new site of Lincoln was about three-quarters of a mile from the small settlement of Postville. &quot;The position is fine and commanding, and if it does not make a big city, we have no doubt it will soon arrive at the dignity of a flourishing and respectable town,&quot; the &quot;Illinois State Register&quot; wrote. &quot;We will also add that the town was named by the proprietors, of whom our enterprising citizen, Virgil Hickox, is one, in honor of A. Lincoln, esq., the attorney of the Chicago and Mississippi Railroad Company.&quot;

Lincoln College (chartered Lincoln University), a private four-year liberal arts college, was founded in early 1865 and granted 2 year degrees until 1929. News of the establishment and name of the school was communicated to President Lincoln shortly before his death, making Lincoln the only college to be named after Lincoln while he was living. Despite the city of Lincoln&#x27;s 90%+ white population, Lincoln college was an HBCU. After a cyber attack in 2021, Lincoln College closed permanently in May 2022. The College had an excellent collection of Abraham Lincoln–related documents and artifacts, housed in a museum which was open to the general public before their closure.

The City of Lincoln was located directly on U.S. Route 66 from 1926 through 1978. This is its secondary tourist theme after the connection with Abraham Lincoln. The Lincoln City Hall was built in 1895. A phone booth was installed on the roof of the building in the 1960s for weather spotting.

American author Langston Hughes spent one year of his youth in Lincoln. Later on, he was to write to his eighth-grade teacher in Lincoln, telling her his writing career began there in the eighth grade, when he was elected class poet.

American theologians Reinhold Niebuhr and Helmut Richard Niebuhr lived in Lincoln from 1902 through their college years. Reinhold Niebuhr first served as pastor of a church when he served as interim minister of Lincoln&#x27;s St. John&#x27;s German Evangelical Synod church following his father&#x27;s death. Reinhold Niebuhr is best known as the author of the Serenity Prayer.

The City of Lincoln features the stone, three-story, domed Logan County Courthouse (1905). This courthouse building replaced the earlier Logan County Courthouse (built 1858) where Lincoln once practiced law; the earlier building had fallen into serious decay and could not be saved. In addition, the Postville Courthouse State Historic Site contains a 1953 replica of the original 1840 Logan County courthouse; Postville, the original county seat, lost its status in 1848 and was itself annexed into Lincoln in the 1860s.

Lincoln was also the site of the Lincoln Developmental Center (LDC); a state institution for the developmentally disabled. Founded in 1877, the institution was one of Logan County&#x27;s largest employers until closed in 2002 by then-Governor George Ryan due to concerns about patient maltreatment. Despite efforts by some Illinois state legislators to reopen LDC, the facility remains shuttered.

==History==

Middletown, founded in 1832, is the oldest town in Logan County. At one time, Middletown was considered as a location for the capital of Illinois. Middletown was a frequent overnight stop for legislators traveling between Springfield and Peoria in the mid-to-late 19th century. The Stage Coach Inn, located off the town square, is the oldest such wooden structure in Illinois. It is believed that Abraham Lincoln stayed at the Inn. Unfortunately, official records were destroyed in a fire many years ago.

The town does have at least one official and verified link to Abe Lincoln as he surveyed the site which would become the town during his early days surveying in Logan County.

Middletown is also home to the Knapp library and museum. The Knapp building is the oldest brick building in Logan county.

Several hot air balloon records were set in Middletown and the historic Vin Fiz, the first cross country flight, counts Middletown as one of the stops on that journey.

Middletown celebrated its Terquasquicentennial (175th birthday) during June 2007.

<text>Decatur ( ) is the largest city in and the county seat of Macon County, Illinois, United States. The city was founded in 1829 and is situated along the Sangamon River and Lake Decatur in Central Illinois. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 70,522. It is the seventeenth-most populous city in Illinois. Decatur has an economy based on industrial and agricultural commodity processing and production. The city is home to Millikin University and Richland Community College.

==History==

===19th century===

The city is named after War of 1812 naval hero Stephen Decatur. The Potawatomi Trail of Death passed through the city in 1838. Post No. 1 of the Grand Army of the Republic was founded by Civil War veterans in Decatur on April 6, 1866.

Decatur was the first home in Illinois of Abraham Lincoln, who settled just west of Decatur with his family in 1830. At the age of 21, Lincoln gave his first political speech in Decatur about the importance of Sangamon River navigation, which caught the attention of Illinois political leaders. As a lawyer on the 8th Judicial Circuit, Lincoln made frequent stops in Decatur, and argued five cases in the log courthouse that stood on the corner of Main &amp; Main Streets. The original courthouse is now on the grounds of the Macon County Historical Museum on North Fork Road. John Hanks, first cousin of Abraham Lincoln, lived in Decatur.

On May 9 and 10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur. At this convention, Lincoln received his first endorsement for President of the United States as &quot;The Railsplitter Candidate&quot;. In commemoration of Lincoln&#x27;s bicentennial, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur at the Decatur Conference Center and Hotel on June 6 and 7, 2008.

===20th century===

The first modern fly-destruction device (fly swatter) was invented in 1900 by Robert R. Montgomery, an entrepreneur based in Decatur, Ill. Montgomery was issued Patent No. 640,790 for the Fly-Killer, a “cheap device of unusual elasticity and durability” made of wire netting, “preferably oblong,” attached to a handle.

For much of the 20th century, the city was known as &quot;The Soybean Capital of the World&quot; owing to its being the location of the headquarters of A. E. Staley Manufacturing Company, a major grain processor in the 1920s, which popularized the use of soybeans to produce products for human consumption such as oil, meal and flour. At one time, over a third of all the soybeans grown in the world were processed in Decatur, Illinois. In 1955 a group of Decatur businessmen founded the Soy Capital Bank to trade on the nickname.

Decatur was awarded the All-America City Award in 1960, one of eleven cities honored that year. Decatur is an affiliate of the U.S. Main Street program, in conjunction with the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

On July 19, 1974, a tanker car containing isobutane collided with a boxcar in the Norfolk &amp; Western railroad yard in the East End of Decatur. The resulting explosion killed seven people, injured 349, and caused $18 million in property damage including extensive damage to nearby Lakeview High School.

On April 18 and 19, 1996, the city was hit by tornadoes. On April 18, an F1 tornado hit the city&#x27;s southeast side, followed by an F3 tornado the following evening on the northwest side. That same tornado then skipped twice, hitting businesses on the northeast side. The two storms totaled approximately $10.5 million in property damage.

A new branding effort for Decatur and Macon County was unveiled in 2015, Limitless Decatur. The marketing strategy intended to attract and retain business and residents by promoting the Decatur area as modern and progressive with opportunities to live, work, and develop.

====Jesse Jackson protest====
In November 1999, Decatur was brought into the national news when Jesse Jackson and the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition protested the two-year expulsion of seven African American students who had been involved in a serious fight at an Eisenhower High School football game under a recently enacted &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policy. Six of the students were arrested but not charged after the fracas. Four were later charged as adults with mob action, a felony. Jesse Jackson intervened in the incident, bringing the controversy to national attention, protesting both the severity and length of the punishment and also alleging racial bias (schools in Decatur in 1999 had an enrollment that was about 44 percent black, while five of the six Decatur students expelled in the prior year were black). Jackson pointed out he was invited by the students&#x27; parents and that he spoke with them, the kids, ministers and teachers before protesting the zero-tolerance severity of the punishment: &quot;No one can survive zero tolerance,&quot; Jackson said. &quot;We all need mercy and grace.&quot;

Outside of Decatur, public support was largely against the School Board&#x27;s decision but changed once a videotape of the incident surfaced filmed by a parent at the game. Broadcast on national TV news, it showed a melee that swept through one end of the grandstands, with kicking and punching, as some of the fighters tumbled over the rails. The game was stopped and players gawked at the fighting in the bleachers. Ed Bohem, the principal at MacArthur High School who attended the game, described it as a riot: &quot;I feared for the safety of our people -- my parents, my students,&quot; Bohem said, referring to the crowd in the bleachers. &quot;You had people pushed through bars, people covering little children so they wouldn&#x27;t get hurt. It was violent.&quot; Jackson and his Rainbow PUSH Coalition organized marches that included hundreds of people bused in from outside the area, criticizing the school board for what Jackson said was unfairly harsh treatment of the boys over a fight. Jackson was arrested and detained briefly; however, charges were later dropped. School officials say the students involved in the fighting were known as truants, described three of them as &quot;third-year freshmen&quot;, and noted that the seven students had missed a combined 350 days of high school.

The issue dissipated when the school board reduced the original expulsions from two years to one year and agreed to let the students earn credit while attending an alternative school.

The students involved in the fight have since taken different paths in life: one having been sentenced to state prison for 10 years for a 2004 felony drug conviction; another having finished college (helped by a Rainbow PUSH scholarship); another working as a butcher; and a fourth being arrested for home invasion in 2009. Jesse Jackson was criticized for turning what could have been a legitimate criticism/discussion of the effects of &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policies into national debate by attempting to present the seven youths as victims of bigotry.

==Economy==
===Industry===
Decatur has production facilities for Caterpillar, Archer Daniels Midland, Mueller Co., and Primient (previously Tate &amp; Lyle, A. E. Staley).

Caterpillar Inc. has one of its largest manufacturing plants in the U.S. in Decatur. This plant produces Caterpillar&#x27;s off highway trucks, wheel-tractor scrapers, compactors, large wheel loaders, mining-class motorgraders, and their ultra-class mining trucks (including the Caterpillar 797). Archer Daniels Midland processes corn and soybeans, Mueller produces water distribution products and Tate &amp; Lyle processes corn in Decatur.

Decatur has been ranked third in the nation as an Emerging Logistics and Distribution Center by Business Facilities: The Location Advisor, and was named a Top 25 Trade City by &quot;Global Trade&quot;. In 2013 the Economic Development Corporation of Decatur &amp; Macon County established the Midwest Inland Port, a multi-modal transportation hub with market proximity to 95 million customers in a 500-mile radius. The port includes the Archer Daniels Midland intermodal container ramp, the two class I railroads that service the ramp and the city (the Canadian National Railway, and the Norfolk Southern Railway), five major roadways and the Decatur Airport. The Midwest Inland Port also has a foreign trade zone and customs clearing, and the area is both an enterprise zone and tax increment financing district.

In August 2019, Mueller Company announced plans to construct a &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; brass foundry in Decatur on a 30-acre site in the 2700 block of North Jasper Street. The facility is expected to employ 250 personnel.

In November 2020, ADM and InnovaFeed announced plans to construct the world&#x27;s largest insect protein facility targeted to begin in 2021. The facility will be owned and operated by InnovaFeed and will co-locate with ADM&#x27;s Decatur corn processing complex. This new project represents innovative, sustainable production to meet growing demand for insect protein in animal feed, a market that has potential to reach 1 million tons in 2027. Construction of the new high-capacity facility is expected to create more than 280 direct and 400 indirect jobs in the Decatur region by the second phase.

===Top employers===

===Former employers===
From 1917 to 1922, Decatur was the location of the Comet Automobile Company, and the Pan-American Motor Corporation.

In 1950, the Marvel-Schebler Division of BorgWarner opened a new facility in Decatur. The plant, which once had as many as 1,300 employees, was sold to Facet Aerospace Products in 1982. The plant closed in April 1983.
In early November 1992, business executive Mark Whitacre of Decatur-based Archer Daniels Midland confessed to an FBI agent that ADM executives, including Whitacre himself, had routinely met with competitors to fix the price of lysine, a food additive. The lysine conspirators, including ADM, ultimately settled federal charges for more than $100 million. ADM also paid hundreds of millions of dollars ($400 million alone on the high-fructose corn syrup class action case) to plaintiffs and customers that it stole from during the price-fixing schemes. In 2014, ADM moved its upper corporate management out of Decatur and established the new ADM World Headquarters in downtown Chicago. Following the ADM corporate exit, Decatur became listed by the United States Census Bureau as number 3 in &quot;The 15 Fastest-Declining Large Cities&quot; which showed a 7.1% population loss of (-5,376) from 2010 to 2019.

Firestone&#x27;s Decatur plant was closed in December 2001 amid a tire failure controversy. All 1,500 employees were laid off. Firestone cited a decline in consumer demand for Firestone tires and the age of the Decatur plant as the reasons for closing that facility.

==Arts and culture==

===Music===
The Decatur Municipal Band was organized September 19, 1857, making it one of the oldest nonmilitary bands in continuous service in the United States and Canada. The band was originally known as the Decatur Brass Band, Decatur Comet Band and Decatur Silver Band until 1871 when it was reorganized by Andrew Goodman and became The Goodman Band. In 1942, the band was officially designated as the Decatur Municipal Band and chartered within the City of Decatur. The present Decatur Municipal Band, directed by Jim Culbertson since 1979, is composed of high school and college students and area adults from all walks of life, many of whom look to the Band as a serious avocation, or as a prelude to a life-long profession.

===Historic sites===

The city&#x27;s symbol is the Transfer House, an 1896 octagonal structure that was built in the original town square (now called &quot;Lincoln Square&quot;) where the city&#x27;s mass transit lines (streetcars and interurban trains) met. Designed by Chicago architect William W. Boyington, who also designed the Chicago Water Tower, the Transfer House was constructed to serve as a shelter for passengers transferring from one conveyance to another. It was regarded as one of the most beautiful structures of its kind in the United States, and a symbol of the city&#x27;s high culture and modernity just decades after it was founded as a small collection of log cabins. The second story of the building consisted of an open-air gazebo used as a stage for public speeches and concerts by the Goodman Band. Sitting in the middle of the square as it was, increasing automobile traffic flowing through downtown Decatur on US 51 was forced to circle around the structure, and the Transfer House came to be seen by some as an impediment. The Illinois Department of Transportation, who maintained the US 51 highway route through Decatur, requested it be removed, and in 1962, the structure was transported by truck to nearby Central Park, where it stands today. In that location, it has served as a bus shelter, a visitor information center, and civic group offices.

The Edward P. Irving House, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and built in 1911, is located at No. 2 Millikin Place, Decatur. In addition, the Robert Mueller Residence, 1 Millikin Place, and the Adolph Mueller Residence, 4 Millikin Place, have been attributed to Wright&#x27;s assistants Hermann V. von Holst and Marion Mahony.

===Library===
In 1901 Andrew Carnegie gave City of Decatur $60,000 to construct a new public library. The library was built in 1902 at the corner of Eldorado and Main and opened to the public July 1, 1903. The building served the community until 1970 when the library moved to North Street at the site of a former Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. store. In 1999 the library moved to its present location on Franklin Street, which is also an abandoned Sears building. The library is part of the Illinois Heartland Library System. The original Carnegie library building was razed in 1972 and in its place a bank was built.

==Parks and recreation==

Local Macon County park resources include Lake Decatur, Lincoln Trail Homestead State Memorial, Rock Springs Conservation Area, Fort Daniel Conservation Area, Sand Creek Recreation Area, Griswold Conservation Area, Friends Creek Regional Park, and Spitler Woods State Natural Area. The Decatur Park District resources include of park land, an indoor sports center, Decatur Airport, three golf courses, softball, soccer and tennis complexes, athletic fields, a community aquatic center, an AZA-accredited zoo, and a banquet, food and beverage business. Decatur was once dubbed &quot;Park City USA&quot; because it had more parks per person than any other city in the country, as well as &quot;Playtown USA&quot; because of Decatur&#x27;s position as an early national leader in providing recreational space for its citizens. A motion picture short by that name was made in 1944 that featured the city&#x27;s recreational efforts.

==Sports==

Decatur was the original home of the Chicago Bears, from 1919 to 1920. The football team was then known as the Decatur Staleys and played at Staley Field, both named after the local food-products manufacturer. A.E. Staley created the team from regular Staley Processing employees who had an interest in the sport. As the team continued to win games and show promise, Staley decided to invest in the team further by hiring George Halas as its second head coach. Halas led the team to success in the 1920 season, going 10–1–2. As the team continued to win, Staley realized that he could make more money and further develop the team if there were larger crowds and a larger venue to play at. Halas and Staley agreed to move the team to Chicago in 1921 and play at Wrigley Field. The team was to play one season as the Chicago Staleys. In 1922, they played their first season as the Chicago Bears.

From 1900 to 1974, Decatur was the home of the Commodores, a minor-league baseball team playing at Fans Field.

The USTA/Ursula Beck Pro Tennis Classic has been held annually since 1999. Male players from over 20 countries compete for $25,000 in prize money as well as ATP world ranking points at the Fairview Park Tennis Complex. The tournament is held for eight consecutive days at Fairview Park concluding on the first weekend in August.

Decatur formerly hosted the annual Decatur-Forsyth Classic presented by Tate &amp; Lyle and the Decatur Park District. The tournament was traditionally held in June. The final year for the tournament was 2019.

==Government==

Between 1829 and 1836, the County Commissioners Court had jurisdiction as it was the seat of Macon County. By 1836 the population reached approximately 300, and Richard Oglesby was elected president of the first board of trustees. Other members of the board of trustees included Dr. William Crissey, H.M. Gorin and Andrew Love as clerk.

In 1839 a town charter was granted to Decatur that gave power to the trustees &quot;to establish and regulate a fire department, to dig wells and erect pumps in the streets, regulate police of the town, [and] raise money for the purpose of commencing and prosecuting works of public improvement.&quot; Those who served as president of the town of Decatur were: Richard Oglesby (1836), Joseph Williams (1837), Henry Snyder (1838), Kirby Benedict (1839), Joseph King (1840), Thomas P. Rodgers (1841), David Crone (1846–47), J.H. Elliott (1848), Joseph Kauffman (1849), Joseph King (1850), William S. Crissey (1851), W.J. Stamper (1852), William Prather (1853–54), and Thomas H. Wingate (1854–55).

In the winter of 1855–56, a special city incorporation charter was obtained. This charter provided an aldermanic form of government and on January 7, 1856, an election was held for mayor, two aldermen for each of the four wards, and city marshal. This aldermanic form of government continued until January 18, 1911, when Decatur changed to city commissioner form of government. The new commissioner system provided a mayor elected at-large and four commissioners to serve as administrators of city services: accounts and finance, public health and safety, public property, and streets and public improvements. The mayor also served as Commissioner of Public Affairs.

The mayor and commissioner system prevailed until a special election on November 25, 1958, in which the present council-manager form of government was adopted.
According to the city website, the &quot;City of Decatur operates under the Council-Manager form of government, a system which combines the leadership of a representative, elected council with the professional background of an appointed manager.&quot; The mayor and all members of the council are elected at-large. Their duties include determining city policy and representing the city in public ceremonies, for which they receive nominal annual salaries. The appointed manager handles all city administration and is the council&#x27;s employee, not an elected official. Since 1959, the following have served as City Managers: John E. Dever, W. Robert Semple, Leslie T. Allen, Jim Bacon, Jim Williams, Steve Garman, John A. Smith (acting), Ryan McCrady, Gregg Zientara (interim), Timothy Gleason, and Scot Wrighton, the current holder.
Julie Moore Wolfe serves as the current mayor of Decatur. Moore Wolfe was appointed unanimously by the Decatur City Council following the death of Mayor Mike McElroy. She is the first female to be mayor of Decatur. Moore Wolfe, who had been appointed mayor pro tem in May 2015, became acting mayor after McElroy died on July 17, 2015. McElroy had been mayor since 2009 and had recently been re-elected to a second term as mayor in April 2015. Moore Wolfe was elected to a four-year term as mayor on April 4, 2017.

===Mayors===

==Transportation==

Decatur Airport is served by daily commercial flights to and from Chicago-O&#x27;Hare International Airport by United Airlines.

For more than 100 years, Decatur has been a major railroad junction and was once served by seven railroads. After mergers and consolidations, it is now served by two Class I railroads: Canadian National and Norfolk Southern. The city is also served by Decatur Junction Railway, Decatur Central Railroad and Decatur &amp; Eastern Illinois Railroad shortlines.

Interstate 72, U.S. Route 51, U.S. Route 36, Illinois Route 48, Illinois Route 105, and Illinois Route 121 are key highway links for the area.

The Decatur Public Transit System (DPTS) provides fixed-route bus service as well as complementary door-to-door paratransit service for people with disabilities, who are unable to use the bus system, throughout the City of Decatur. Under an agreement with the Village of Forsyth, service is also provided to the Hickory Point Mall area in Forsyth.

==State government facilities==
Decatur Correctional Center, a prison for women, is in the city.

==Notable people==
==In popular culture==
Decatur has been mentioned in several movies, including the 1984 movie Bachelor Party, the 1986 movie Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off, and the 2008 movie Leatherheads. The eclectic folk artist Sufjan Stevens included a song on his 2005 album Illinois called &quot;Decatur, or, Round of Applause for Your Stepmother!&quot;

Decatur was also the primary location for the filming of &quot;The Informant!&quot;, starring Matt Damon. The movie was centered around a scandal which occurred at Archer Daniels Midland in the 1990s.

==Sister cities==
Decatur&#x27;s sister cities are:
* Tokorozawa, Japan (since 1966)
* Seevetal, Germany (since 1975)

The Decatur Sister Cities Committee annually coordinates both inbound and outbound high school students, who serve as ambassadors among the three cities.

In the fall of 1828, a band of Native Americans from the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma arrived and set up camp along Long Creek and began trapping, hunting, and fishing. When they were relatively unsuccessful at catching game, the Kickapoo began killing hogs and stealing poultry from the early settlers. Eventually a group of settlers drove them from the county.

<doc id="111553" wikidata="Q575926" url="?curid=111553" title="Benld, Illinois">
<text>Benld (pronounced ) is a city in Macoupin County, Illinois, United States. The population was 1,464 at the 2020 census, down from 1,556 in 2010. It is located in the Metro-East portion of the Greater St. Louis metropolitan area.

&quot;Benld&quot; was declared the &quot;most difficult to pronounce&quot; place name in the state of Illinois by &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;.

==History==
Benld was established in 1903. The name derives from founder Benjamin L. Dorsey (d. June 19, 1895), who was responsible for gaining the land on which the town was built and coal mining rights. &quot;Benld&quot; is the combination of Dorsey&#x27;s first name and his middle and last initial.
The village was home to a Russian Orthodox church until 2010. Opened in 1901 by Carpatho-Rusyn immigrants, Holy Dormition was converted to a Monastery in 2010. The church was founded to serve the immigrant mining community. 

On September 29, 1938, a meteorite landed in Benld, marking only the third meteorite landing in Illinois since records were kept. It is one of the few known meteorites to strike a man-made object, punching a hole in the roof of Edward McCain&#x27;s garage and embedding itself in the seat of his 1928 Pontiac coupe. A neighbor, Mrs. Carl Crum, was standing about fifty feet from the impact and may be the individual who came closest to being struck by a meteorite in history up to that time. The meteorite and portions of the car are now on display at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.

In March 2009, the seven-year-old Benld Elementary school was damaged beyond repair and ultimately condemned. The damage was caused by mine subsidence and left more than 700 students without a school. The students were moved to the Gillespie High School and Middle School campus, where they finished the remainder of the year on a split shift schedule. High school and middle school students attended school from 6:30am to noon, and elementary aged students attended from 12:30pm until 5:00 pm. The students started the 2010 school year on the split shift. On November 2, 2010, all students returned to a normal schedule, with the elementary children attending class in three different locations (modular units, middle school classrooms, and the S.S. Simon &amp; Jude Catholic School). The district was allowed to collect only $350,000 in mine subsidence insurance due to limits imposed by the state of Illinois. The district is in line to receive funding from the Capital Development Board to help with the construction of a new elementary school. The school is responsible for 20% of the $22 million budget to build a new school. The school district is actively pursuing grants to fulfill their responsibility. The Ben-Gil Boosters, an organization formed to help raise funds for the construction of the new school, won $250,000 in April 2010 through Pepsi&#x27;s Refresh Everything Campaign. The new school is adjacent to the district&#x27;s middle school and high school in Gillespie. Its name has been changed to Ben-Gil Elementary School, to reflect both communities.

At a special CUSD 7 Board of Education meeting on August 16, 2017, the board approved a $4 million settlement with the Union Pacific Railroad, legal owners of the assets of the former Superior Coal Company, in connection with the subsidence. Originally, the district had been awarded $9.85 million in 2014, but Union Pacific appealed that ruling.

<text>Bunker Hill is a city in Macoupin County, Illinois, United States. The population was 1,630 at the 2020 census, down from 1,774 in 2010.

==History==
===Settlement===
The original inhabitants of the Bunker Hill area were the Peoria people, Kickapoo people, and Winnebago people. They were forcibly removed from the area by the United States government around 1830.

As Euro-Americans arrived in Macoupin County, the site of the future Bunker Hill was settled in 1830. At that time, the area was known as &quot;Wolf Ridge&quot;, due to the presence of wolves in the vicinity. The first settler was Elijah Lincoln in 1830, who established a land claim one and a half miles southwest of present Bunker Hill. Shortly after he made his claim, Lincoln and a Mr. Tuttle laid out a town, named &quot;Lincoln&quot; after the first settler. The earliest post office in the area was established in 1833 a mile south of Lincoln. A school house was built around 1831, and was also used as the meeting hall for the Baptist denomination. The first church in the area was built by the Baptists. The second was the Congregational church in nearby Woodburn.

In 1834, County Surveyor Luke Knowlton entered of land that now cover the center of Bunker Hill. On December 25, 1835, Moses True of Salisbury, New Hampshire, John Tilden of Boston, Massachusetts, and Robert Smith of Alton, Illinois, visited Lincoln and formed a company to plat a town and improve the surrounding countryside. By 1836, the settlement of Lincoln had been abandoned, prompting Moses and company to establish a new town, which became Bunker Hill in 1837.

===The tornado of 1948===
At 6:45am CST on March 19, 1948, a tornado that originated in Alton, Illinois, blew through Bunker Hill, destroying the majority of the town&#x27;s buildings and killing 19 people. Although the tornado was only in town for less than a minute, the destruction was devastating. The downtown business district lost many of its buildings. The streets were impassable due to rubble from the storm. The newly renovated Meissner School was one of few buildings virtually undamaged by the tornado. A first aid station was set up in the school, with a temporary morgue in another classroom. By 9:00 am, ambulances from Alton, Carlinville, Litchfield, and Gillespie arrived to transport the injured to local hospitals. By the end of the day, National Guard units, US Army units, the Red Cross, Salvation Army, American Legion, VFW, and Illinois State Police had arrived to restore order and provide assistance to the citizens of Bunker Hill.

The Army and National Guard established patrols to minimize looting, and the State Police set up road blocks to keep sightseers away. The Red Cross, Salvation Army, and Lebanon American Legion opened food stations to feed the volunteers and homeless citizens of the town. Bahn&#x27;s Grocery Store donated their entire stock for the food stations. A temporary post office was opened in the lobby of the First National Bank. Local farmers brought their tractors and bulldozers to town to clear rubble and reopen the streets.

By evening, the Red Cross had pitched tents in front of Meissner School to house the newly homeless citizens. 126 people were injured and 19 killed by the tornado. Property damage was estimated between four and five million dollars. All five churches in Bunker Hill were destroyed by the tornado, prompting two local ministers, Rev. Burke of the First Congregational Church and Rev. Johnson of the Baptist Church, to conduct the Easter Sunday services on March 28, 1948, using a bulldozer as a pulpit. An estimated 500 residents and volunteers gathered at the center of town for the sermons before returning to work.

A brick pavilion stood in the middle of the intersection of Washington and Warren Streets prior to the tornado. The pavilion, which had been used as a bandstand for community events, was not rebuilt after the tornado, instead being replaced by a flagpole and memorial to local military veterans.

===Bunker Hill Military Academy===
Bunker Hill was the home of the Bunker Hill Military Academy toward the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. The school opened in 1859 as the Bunker Hill Academy, but closed during the Civil War. From 1862 until 1869, the building housed Bunker Hill&#x27;s public school. In 1883, the military academy was established in the aging building, offering strict instruction to local children as well as the cadets. The academy remained open until 1914. After the 1948 tornado, the grounds were donated to the American Legion, which built a local post and park on the site.

==Geography==
Bunker Hill is located in southern Macoupin County in the eastern part of Bunker Hill Township. Carlinville, the Macoupin county seat, is to the north, Alton on the Mississippi River is to the southwest, and downtown St. Louis is to the south-southwest.

The nearest airport is the St. Louis Regional Airport, southwest of Bunker Hill in Bethalto.

==Lincoln statue==

Bunker Hill is the home of one of four statues of Abraham Lincoln sculpted by William Grandville Hastings. In 1904, Captain Charles Clinton, formerly of Company B of the First Missouri Voluntary Cavalry, donated the statue to the citizens of Bunker Hill in commemoration of the service of local veterans in Company B during the Civil War. The cost of the granite base was raised through voluntary subscription, and the bronze casting of Lincoln was shipped from Philadelphia.

On September 7, 1904, the statue was unveiled by Miss Mary True, daughter of the town&#x27;s founder. An estimated 7,000 attended the dedication of the statue following a parade through the center of town. Illinois Governor Richard Yates Jr. and Senator Shelby M. Collum were present to witness the ceremonies. Also present were local veterans of Company B John Dennison (Carlinville), James G. Rumbolz (Bunker Hill), Fred Dabel (Bunker Hill), Herman Heuer (Dorsey), James Lawrence (Carlinville), James Pocklington (Carlinville), John Brandenburger (Bunker Hill), E.S. Williams (Bunker Hill), and August Kardel (Upper Alton). Captain Clinton was also present for the dedication.

A plaque mounted on the statue&#x27;s base reads:
The statue also includes Lady Liberty kneeling at the base, etching the words &quot;with malice toward none.&quot;

The Lincoln statue rests in the middle of the intersection of North Washington (IL Route 159) and Fayette streets.

<text>Carlinville is a city in and the county seat of Macoupin County, Illinois, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 5,710.

It is the home of Blackburn College, a small college affiliated with the Presbyterian church. The city is the former home of Prairie Farms Dairy.

== History ==
Carlinville is named for Thomas Carlin, seventh governor of Illinois, who as a member of the state legislature was instrumental in creating Macoupin County.

Carlinville has long been a site of Illinois history, and played host to many presidential hopefuls via campaign stops at a time in American history when railway routes produced many visits by politicians. Perhaps the largest and most important hallmark of Carlinville&#x27;s history is its courthouse, the largest built outside of New York City at the time of its erection. Built in 1870 and designed by famous state capitol building architect Elijah E. Myers, the construction of Carlinville&#x27;s courthouse produced its candidacy for the location of the state capitol. Locally, it is known as &quot;The Million Dollar Courthouse&quot; due to its cost overruns at the time it was built.

In the early 1900s Carlinville became the site of a great many Sears Catalog Homes. An entire neighborhood was constructed of the homes and was funded, in 1918, by Standard Oil of Indiana for its mineworkers in Carlinville, at a cost of approximately one million dollars. In gratitude, Sears, Roebuck named one of its house models the &quot;Carlin&quot;. Today 149 of the original 156 homes still exist, the largest single repository of Sears Catalog Homes in the United States.

One notable resident of Carlinville was American entomologist Charles Robertson, who carried out what is still the single most intensive study of flower-visiting insects of a single locality (Carlinville), culminating in a 221-page book published in 1928 under the title &quot;Flowers and Insects&quot;. From among the specimens he collected in the process of doing this study, he named over 100 new species of bees and wasps. Scientists in 1970–1972 did a similar survey, and found that most of the bees noted by Robertson were still present. This is presumably due to the existence of bee habitat in hedgerows, on slopes, and in other non-agricultural land in the survey area.

Other notable Carlinvillians include nature writer and novelist Mary Hunter Austin, once called &quot;the most intelligent woman in America&quot; by H.G. Wells, distinguished military personnel, politicians, and others.

==Geography==
Carlinville is in central Macoupin County. Illinois Routes 4 and 108 pass through the city center, joining as East 1st South Street through the city&#x27;s east side. Route 4 leads north-northeast to Springfield, the state capital, and south to Staunton, while Route 108 leads east to Interstate 55 and west to Carrollton.

==Transportation==
Illinois Route 4 passes north to south through Carlinville. Interstate 55 passes east of the city. Illinois Route 108 passes through Carlinville connecting Interstate 55 to the east with Kampsville to the west, where it crosses the Illinois River on a free, state-operated ferry.

The Carlinville Amtrak station is served directly by five daily trains, offering easy access south to St. Louis and north to Springfield and Chicago. One train is the &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; which connects Chicago to Texas and features sleeping cars, a dining car and a lounge.

Freight rail service is provided by the Union Pacific Railroad, formerly the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio, the Illinois Central Gulf, the Chicago, Missouri and Western, and the Southern Pacific Chicago - St. Louis Railways. The main line of the GM&amp;O passed through Carlinville.

The Illinois Terminal Railroad, an electric interurban to St. Louis from Springfield that once provided both freight and passenger service, passed down the middle of Carlinville&#x27;s West Street. It was still operating freight trains on West Street to a nearby grain elevator into the 1970s. Its trestle crossing Goat Hollow south of Carlinville burned severing the line, which was then abandoned. A small portion of the line is used by Monterey Coal Co. mine to connect with the former Chicago and North Western Transportation Company L &amp; M District, serving coal-fired power plants.
