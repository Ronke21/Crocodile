<text>Đorđe Balašević (; 11 May 1953 – 19 February 2021) was a Serbian singer and songwriter, writer, poet and director. He began his career in the late 1970s as a member of the band Rani Mraz, transitioning after two albums to a solo career. He first gained mainstream prominence for writing Rani Mraz&#x27;s hit &quot;Računajte na nas&quot; (Count on Us), which was often described as an anthem of a generation. Noted for his vivid lyricism and poetry, Balašević was also known for weaving political commentary into his songs and live performance.

Broadly supportive of South Slavic unity in late 1970s and early 1980s, in the lead up to the Yugoslav wars he began to criticise the authorities. During the Yugoslav wars, he became a prominent anti-war voice in the region, thanks to which he also became an UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador. Balašević was the first Serbian act to perform in Sarajevo following the siege of Sarajevo. Balašević became one of the most prominent critics of Slobodan Milošević&#x27;s regime, at considerable personal risk. Balašević was a prolific singer and writer, he recorded 14 albums and wrote 8 books during his career and has been characterised by media and commentators as &quot;musical legend&quot; and author of many &quot;evergreen hits&quot;.

== Early biography ==
Balašević was born to a Serbian father Jovan, and mother Veronika Dolenec, half Hungarian and a half Croatian from Rasinja near Koprivnica, Croatia. He had a sister Jasna. His grandfather&#x27;s surname was Balaš but during the World War II his grandfather changed it to Balašević in fear of being Magyarized.

The younger Balašević grew up in Jovan Cvijić street in Novi Sad, in the same house where he lived until his death. He started writing poetry in primary school. He left high school in the third year but managed to get a high school diploma as a correspondence student and passed the preliminary exam for the university study of geography. He never graduated from the university but instead, he decided to pursue a music career, and in 1977 he joined the band Žetva.

== Musical career ==
=== Early career: Žetva and Rani Mraz ===
After Balašević joined the group, Žetva recorded a humorous tango-oriented hit single &quot;U razdeljak te ljubim&quot; (I Lay a Kiss on Your Parting), which was sold in more than 180,000 copies.
In 1978, he left Žetva and, together with Verica Todorović, formed the band &quot;Rani Mraz&quot;. The band had its debut at the 1978 music festival in Opatija with the song &quot;Moja prva ljubav&quot; (My First Love). During 1978, former Suncokret members Biljana Krstić and Bora Đorđević joined the band (forming the most famous Rani Mraz lineup), and together they recorded &quot;Računajte na nas&quot; (Count on Us), written by Balašević, a song which celebrated the youth&#x27;s adoption of the communist revolution. The song became popular with both the communist authorities and the people, becoming an anthem of the Yugoslav youth. After just a few months of cooperation, Verica Todorović and Bora Đorđević left the band (Đorđević forming his famous hard rock band Riblja Čorba). Biljana Krstić and Balašević then recorded Rani Mraz&#x27;s first album &quot;Mojoj mami umesto maturske slike u izlogu&quot; (&quot;To my Mom instead of Prom Photo in the Shop-Window&quot;) with the help of studio musicians.

At the 1979 Split Festival, Balašević won the first prize with the single &quot;Panonski mornar&quot; (Pannonian Sailor). A few months later, Rani Mraz sold out Belgrade&#x27;s Dom Sindikata Hall eight times in a row. In 1980, Balašević served in the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army in Zagreb and Požarevac, where he had a role in the TV show &quot;Vojnici&quot; (&quot;Soldiers&quot;), but also found time to write song &quot;Zbog tebe&quot; (Because of You) for Zdravko Čolić and lyrics for several songs recorded on Srebrna krila album &quot;Ja sam samo jedan od mnogih s gitarom&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m only One of Many with a Guitar&quot;).

By the end of 1980, Balašević and Krstić released their second and final album under the name Rani Mraz, with a symbolic title &quot;Odlazi cirkus&quot; (&quot;The Circus Is Leaving&quot;). The album reaffirmed Balašević&#x27;s status and delivered several hit songs, one of them being &quot;Priča o Vasi Ladačkom&quot; (Story of Vasa Ladački) which went on to become one of Balašević&#x27;s signature songs. However, Rani Mraz officially dissolved after that.

=== Solo career ===
==== 1980s ====
Balašević started his solo career in 1982 with the album &quot;Pub&quot; (&quot;Jack&quot;) which was well received, bringing hits &quot;Boža zvani Pub&quot; (Boža Known as the Jack), &quot;Pesma o jednom petlu&quot; (The Song about a Rooster), &quot;Lepa protina kći&quot; (Archpriest&#x27;s Beautiful Daughter) and &quot;Ratnik paorskog srca&quot; (Warrior with a Peasant&#x27;s Heart). The album was produced by Josip Boček, who would also produce Balašević&#x27;s following two releases. Shortly after, Balašević had a role in the TV series &quot;Pop Ćira i pop Spira&quot; (&quot;Priest Ćira and Priest Spira&quot;), recorded after Stevan Sremac&#x27;s novel of the same title. At the time, he wrote the song &quot;Hej, čarobnjaci, svi su vam đaci&quot; (Hey, Magicians, Everyone Can Learn from You) for the football club Red Star Belgrade.

In December 1983, Balašević released the album &quot;Celovečernji the Kid&quot; (&quot;Wholevening the Kid&quot;), which featured hits &quot;Svirajte mi &#x27;Jesen stiže, dunjo moja&#x27;&quot; (Play &#x27;Autumn Is Coming, My Dear&#x27; to Me), &quot;Neko to od gore vidi sve&quot; (Someone from up above Watches it All), &quot;Blues mutne vode&quot; (Muddy Water Blues), &quot;Lunjo&quot; (Hey, Tramp) and &quot;Don Francisco Long Play&quot;. The following album, &quot;003&quot;, was released in 1985, and brought hits &quot;Slovenska&quot; (The Slavic Song), &quot;Al&#x27; se nekad dobro jelo&quot; (Back Then Eating Was Good), &quot;Badnje veče&quot; (&quot;Christmas Eve&quot;) and &quot;Olivera&quot;.

In 1986, Balašević released the album &quot;Bezdan&quot; (&quot;Abyss&quot;), which brought hits &quot;Ne lomite mi bagrenje&quot; (Don&#x27;t Break My Locust Trees), &quot;Bezdan&quot; and &quot;Ne volim januar&quot; (I Don&#x27;t Like January). The record was produced by Đorđe Petrović and arrangements were done by Aleksandar Dujin. Those two would be the key associates of Balašević in the following years. They became the backbone of Balašević&#x27;s supporting band nicknamed The Unfuckables.

In 1987, Balašević released his first live album, double album &quot;U tvojim molitvama – Balade&quot; (&quot;In Your Prayers – Ballads&quot;). The album was recorded during 1986 and 1987 on his concerts in Zetra hall in Sarajevo, Ledena dvorana and Šalata in Zagreb, Sava Centar in Belgrade, and Studio M in Novi Sad. The album featured a gift single with previously unreleased tracks &quot;1987&quot; and &quot;Poluuspavanka&quot; (Half-Lullaby). The album also featured previously unrecorded track &quot;Samo da rata ne bude&quot; (Just Let There be no War) which was recorded live with a large children&#x27;s choir. On 19 July 1987, Balašević, alongside Parni Valjak, Leb i sol and Riblja Čorba, performed at Stadion Maksimir in Zagreb on the 1987 Summer Universiade closing ceremony.

Balašević&#x27;s next studio album, &quot;Panta Rei&quot;, released in 1988. The song &quot;Requiem&quot; was dedicated to late Josip Broz Tito, while satire &quot;Soliter&quot; (High-rise) caricatures Yugoslavia as a building in which only façade still holds while foundations slide. Blues sound was present in the songs &quot;Neki se rode kraj vode&quot; (Some Were Born By the Water) and &quot;Nemam ništa s tim&quot; (I Have Nothing to Do with It). Balašević&#x27;s following album, &quot;Tri posleratna druga&quot; (&quot;Three postwar Friends&quot;), was subtitled &quot;Muzika iz istoimenog romana&quot; (&quot;Music from the Novel of the Same Name&quot;), referring to his novel &quot;Tri posleratna druga&quot;. The album was recorded by Dujin, bass guitarist Aleksandar Kravić, and two musicians from Rijeka, guitarist Elvis Stanić (a former Linija 23, Denis &amp; Denis, and Dr Doktor member) and drummer Tonči Grabušić. The album featured radio hits &quot;Kad odem&quot; (When I&#x27;m Gone) &quot;D-moll&quot; (D minor), &quot;Ćaletova pesma&quot; (Dad&#x27;s Song), &quot;Saputnik&quot; (Fellow Traveler), &quot;O. Bože&quot; (Oh God), and folk-oriented &quot;Devojka sa čardaš nogama&quot; (A Girl with Csárdás Legs). The song &quot;Sugar Rap&quot; featured caricatured rap sound.

==== 1990s ====
The album &quot;Marim ja...&quot; (&quot;As if&quot; &quot;I care...&quot;) was released in 1991. Beside Balašević&#x27;s old associates, the album featured Davor Rodik (pedal steel guitar), Nenad Jazunović (percussion), and Josip &quot;Kiki&quot; Kovač (violin). The songs &quot;Nevernik&quot; (The Nonbeliever), &quot;Ringišpil&quot; (Carousel), &quot;Divlji badem&quot; (Wild Almond) were the album&#x27;s biggest hits.

As the Yugoslav Wars erupted, Balašević was forced to stop collaborating with Stanić and Grabušić (the two forming the jazz rock band Elvis Stanić Group). Balašević withdrew to isolation, partly due to his anti-war attitudes. His next album &quot;Jedan od onih života...&quot; (&quot;One of Those Lives...&quot;), released in 1993, featured Aleksandar Dujin on piano, Dušan Bezuha on guitar, Đorđe Petrović on keyboards, Aleksandar Kravić on bass guitar, Josip Kovač on saxophone, and Dragoljub Đuričić (formerly of YU grupa, Leb i Sol and Kerber) on drums. The songs such as &quot;Krivi smo mi&quot; (It&#x27;s Our Fault) and &quot;Čovek sa mesecom u očima&quot; (The Man with the Moon in His Eyes) heavily criticized and denounced the ongoing war. At the same time, the compilation album &quot;Najveći hitovi&quot; (&quot;Greatest hits&quot;), featuring songs recorded during the 1986–1991 period, was released. The songs which appeared on the compilation were chosen by Balašević himself.

After a long break, at the beginning of 1996, he issued &quot;Naposletku...&quot; (&quot;After All...&quot;). Beside Balašević&#x27;s old associates, the album featured young drummer Petar Radmilović. &quot;Na posletku...&quot; was mainly folk rock-oriented. Nearly all instruments on the album are acoustic, with the violin becoming dominant and woodwind instruments heavily used. In 1997, the live album &quot;Da l&#x27; je sve bilo samo fol?&quot;, recorded on 6 December 1996 on a concert in Maribor, was released in Slovenia.

The album &quot;Devedesete&quot; (&quot;Nineties&quot;), self-released by Balašević in the spring of 2000, was his most politically involved album. The album was produced by Petrović, and, beside old associates, featured the saxophonist Gabor Bunford.

==== 2000s ====

In 2001, Balašević released the album &quot;Dnevnik starog momka&quot; (&quot;Diary of an Old Bachelor&quot;). The album comprised 12 songs, each having a female name as its title. The song titles form the acrostic &quot;Olja je najbolja&quot; (Olja is the Best), Olja being the nickname of Balašević&#x27;s wife Olivera Balašević. Balašević stated on several occasions that the girls the songs were named after are pure fiction. In 2002, the compilation album &quot;Ostaće okrugli trag na mestu šatre&quot; (trans. &quot;A Round Trace Will Remain at the Place where Tent Used to Be&quot;, named after a verse from the song &quot;Odlazi cirkus&quot;) was released. The album featured the choice of songs from Balašević&#x27;s solo career, with some of the older songs prerecorded.

Balašević released the songs that should have been the soundtrack for the film &quot;Goose Feather&quot; on the album &quot;Rani mraz&quot;. The album&#x27;s subtitle was &quot;Priča o Vasi Ladačkom.../Muzika iz nesnimljenog filma&quot; (&quot;Story of Vasa Ladački.../Music from the Film that was not Filmed&quot;). The album featured folk rock sound similar to the one on &quot;Na posletku&quot;. The album featured rerecorded &quot;Priča o Vasi Ladačkom&quot; and the instrumental track based on it, &quot;Pričica o Vasi L.&quot; (Short Story about Vasa L.). The album also featured the song &quot;Maliganska&quot;, which Balašević wrote at the beginning of his career and unsuccessfully offered to Zvonko Bogdan, and which was previously released by pop rock/folk rock band Apsolutno Romantično under the title &quot;Đoletova pesma&quot; (&quot;Đole&#x27;s Song&quot;). The album, beside old associates, featured Zoran and Pera Alvirović (of Apsolutno Romantično), Andrej Maglovski (accordion), Stevan Mošo (prim), Beni Ćibri (double bass), Agota Vitkai Kučera (soprano), St. George Choir, and others.

==== 2010s ====

In 2010, Balašević directed the film &quot;Like An Early Frost&quot; (originally titled &quot;Kao rani mraz&quot;), starring Daniel Kovačević, Rade Šerbedžija and Balašević&#x27;s daughter Jovana, based on the song &quot;Priča o Vasi Ladačkom&quot;. The film received mostly negative reviews by the critics. In 2012, Balašević released six new songs among which are: &quot;Berba &#x27;59.&quot; (Harvest of &#x27;59), &quot;Ljubav ne pobeđuje&quot; (Love Doesn&#x27;t Win) and &quot;Osmeh se vratio u grad&quot; (Smile Returned to Town). In 2015, Balašević released a song &quot;Duet&quot; dedicated to Kemal Monteno who had died in January of that year. In 2016, Balašević released a song &quot;Mala vidra sa Begeja&quot; (Little otter from Bega river).

=== Concerts ===
His traditional New Year&#x27;s concerts in Sava Center hall in Belgrade were traditionally sold out. He sold out Sava Center for the first time in the 1982/1983 season.

== Civic engagement ==
After having released one of his early songs &quot;Računajte na nas&quot; (&quot;You Can Count on Us&quot;), Balašević was deemed politically involved. Together with another early single &quot;Triput sam video Tita&quot; (&quot;I Saw Tito Three Times&quot;), he was expressing support for Yugoslavism and Titoism. In 2018, he commented that &quot;Yugoslavia wasn&#x27;t much good - if it had been good it would not have fallen apart so bloodily&quot;.

During the second half of the 1980s, Balašević began to criticize the authorities, and in the early 1990s, his songs and stage speeches showed disillusionment and sadness over the fact that bloodshed was possible in the Yugoslavia he had once admired. He openly criticized the up-and-coming forms of ethnic nationalism in Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Slovenia.

In the ensuing war years, Balašević&#x27;s career suffered due to his open conflict with the government of Slobodan Milošević. At that point, Balašević was one of only handful of public figures who had openly stated their opposition to Milošević&#x27;s authoritarian regime. During his concert performances, he often criticized and mocked Milošević and other Serbian politicians. In 1996, he became the UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador for his antiwar statements during the Yugoslav Wars and held the first post-war concert in Sarajevo as the first Serbian artist visiting the war-torn Bosnia and Herzegovina.

In 2000, he took part in protests during and following the downfall of Slobodan Milošević. In 2006, after Montenegro had declared independence from the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, Balašević sent a letter to then Prime Minister of Montenegro Milo Đukanović in which he congratulated Đukanović on the independence of Montenegro. He voted for Boris Tadić in the 2008 and the 2012 Serbian presidential election.

== Personal life ==
Balašević lived in Novi Sad in the same house where he grew up, with his wife Olivera (born Savić in Zrenjanin), who was a ballerina and a member of the national gymnastics team, and their three children; daughters Jovana (an actress, born in 1980) and Jelena (born in 1984), and son Aleksa (born in 1994). He had married Olivera on 7 May 1981 in Novi Sad. On 14 November 2019, Balašević suffered a myocardial infarction. For most of his life, he declared himself as a Yugoslav.

== Death ==

Balašević died on 19 February 2021, in Novi Sad from complications of pneumonia, caused by COVID-19. On 22 February 2021, an event called Noć kada je Đole preplivao Dunav (eng. &quot;Night when Đole crossed the Danube&quot;) was organized in Novi Sad in memory of him. One of the participants was the Serbian National Theater choir.

== Legacy ==
The 1998 book &quot;YU 100: najbolji albumi jugoslovenske rok i pop muzike&quot; (&quot;YU 100: The Best albums of Yugoslav pop and rock music&quot;) features two Đorđe Balašević solo albums, &quot;Bezdan&quot; (ranked No. 25) and &quot;Pub&quot; (ranked No. 66), and one Rani Mraz album, &quot;Mojoj mami umesto maturske slike u izlogu&quot; (ranked No. 44).

In 2000, the song &quot;Slovenska&quot; polled No. 69 on the &quot;Rock Express&quot; Top 100 Yugoslav Rock Songs of All Times list. In 2006, the song &quot;Priča o Vasi Ladačkom&quot; polled No. 13 B92 Top 100 Domestic Songs list. In 2011, the song &quot;Menuet&quot; was polled, by the listeners of Radio 202, one of 60 greatest songs released by PGP-RTB/PGP-RTS during the sixty years of the label&#x27;s existence.

In 2007, twenty-one bands from Balašević&#x27;s native Novi Sad, including Zbogom Brus Li, Pero Defformero, Super s Karamelom and others, recorded a tribute album to Balašević entitled &quot;Neki noviji klinci i...&quot;. In 2012, singer-songwriter and former Azra leader Branimir &quot;Johnny&quot; Štulić released a cover of &quot;U razdeljak te ljubim&quot; on his official YouTube channel.

In 2016, the sketch show Državni posao created an episode which was based on Balašević&#x27;s song Sugar Rap. On 17 January 2020, Državni posao aired an episode which referred to concerts which Balašević had traditionally held on the Epiphany (19 January).

Only nine days before Balašević&#x27;s death, Državni posao aired an episode named after his song &quot;Računajte na nas&quot;. Within a week of his passing, Državni posao aired an episode named after Balašević&#x27;s song Odlazi cirkus.

Even after the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s, Balašević had remained immensely popular and well-liked not only in Serbia but throughout all former Yugoslav republics. News of his death was widely reported by the Croatian and Bosnian media, with Bosnian web portal &quot;Klix.ba&quot; describing Balašević as a &quot;legendary&quot; performer whose songs could &quot;inspire deepest emotions.&quot; In his hometown of Novi Sad, hundreds of people gathered on a vigil, and similar spontaneous fan gatherings occurred in Zagreb, Pula, Sarajevo, and other cities across the region. The Mayor of Novi Sad, Miloš Vučević declared 21 February a day of mourning.

<doc id="113297" wikidata="Q208086" url="?curid=113297" title="Odo of France">
<text>Odo (; c. 857 – 1 January 898) was the elected King of West Francia from 888 to 898. He was the first king from the Robertian dynasty, the parent house of the House of Capet. Before assuming the kingship, Odo was the count of Paris. His reign marked the definitive separation of West Francia from the Carolingian Empire, which would never be reunited.

==Family and inheritance==

Odo was the eldest son of Robert the Strong, Duke of the Franks, Margrave of Neustria, and Count of Anjou and Adelaide of Tours. After his father&#x27;s death at the Battle of Brissarthe in 866, Odo inherited the Margraviate of Neustria. Odo lost this title in 868 when King Charles the Bald appointed Hugh the Abbot to the title but regained it after Hugh&#x27;s death in 886. After 882 he was the count of Paris. Odo was also the lay abbot of St. Martin of Tours.

In 882 or 883 Odo married Théodrate of Troyes. The eleventh-century chronicler Adémar de Chabannes wrote that they had a son, Arnoul (c.882–898), who died shortly after his father. Guy is named as one of the couple&#x27;s children in an Alan I&#x27;s charter dated 28 August 903, but genealogist Christian Settipani has argued that the document is false.
The genealogical work Europäische Stammtafeln refers to Raoul as a son of Odo by Théodrate, but its primary source is not known.

==Reign==

For his skill and bravery in resisting the attacks of Vikings during the 885–886 Siege of Paris, Odo was chosen by the western Frankish nobles to be their king following the overthrow of Emperor Charles the Fat. He was crowned at Compiègne in February 888 by Walter, Archbishop of Sens.

Odo continued to battle against the Vikings and defeated them at Montfaucon, but was soon involved in a struggle with powerful Frankish nobles who supported the claim of Charles the Simple to the throne.

In 890 Odo granted special privileges to the County of Manresa in Osona. Because of its position on the front line against the Moorish aggression, Manresa was given the right to build towers of defence known as &quot;manresanas&quot; or &quot;manresanes&quot;. This privilege was responsible for giving Manresa its unique character, distinct from the rest of Osona, for the next two centuries.

To gain prestige and support, Odo paid homage to East Francia&#x27;s King Arnulf in 888. Despite this, in 894 Arnulf declared his support for Charles the Simple, and after a conflict which lasted three years, Odo was compelled to come to terms with his rival and surrender a district north of the Seine to him. Odo died in La Fère on 1 January 898.
==In popular culture==
A character named &quot;Count Odo&quot; is portrayed by Owen Roe in the History Channel&#x27;s 2013 hit TV series &quot;Vikings&quot;. This fictional Odo actually saves Paris from a Viking attack, but is killed before ever succeeding in becoming king.

Count Odo appears in &quot;The Siege of Paris&quot;, the second expansion to the 2020 video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&quot;.

Odo appears in the game &quot;Crusader Kings III&quot; as a bookmarked character. Players can play as him from the year 867, when he is ten years old, and may gain an achievement for leading his dynasty to rule the Kingdom of France.

<text>Odo of Bayeux (died 1097) was Bishop of Bayeux in Normandy and was also made Earl of Kent in England following the Norman Conquest. He was the maternal half-brother of duke, and later king, William the Conqueror, and was, for a time, William&#x27;s primary administrator in the Kingdom of England, although he was eventually tried for defrauding William&#x27;s government. It is likely Odo commissioned the Bayeux Tapestry, a large tableau of the Norman Conquest, perhaps to present to his brother William. He later fell out with his brother over Odo&#x27;s support for military adventures in Italy. William, on his deathbed, freed Odo. Odo died in Palermo Sicily on the way to crusade.

==Early life==
Odo was the son of William the Conqueror&#x27;s mother Herleva and Herluin de Conteville. Count Robert of Mortain was his younger brother. There is uncertainty about his birth date. Some historians have suggested he was born around 1035. Duke William made him bishop of Bayeux in 1049. It has been suggested that his birth was as early as 1030, making him about nineteen rather than fourteen at the time.

==Norman Conquest and after==
Although Odo was an ordained Christian cleric, he is best known as a warrior and statesman, participating in the Council of Lillebonne. He funded ships for the Norman invasion of England and is one of the very few proven companions of William the Conqueror known to have fought at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. The Bayeux Tapestry, probably commissioned by him to adorn his own cathedral, appears to labour the point that he did not actually fight, that is to say shed blood, at Hastings, but rather encouraged the troops from the rear. The Latin annotation embroidered onto the Tapestry above his image reads: (&quot;EPS&quot; abbreviating &quot;bishop&quot; and &quot;BACULU&quot; omitting a final &quot;m&quot; – &quot;cudgel&quot;), in English &quot;Here Odo the bishop holding a club strengthens the boys&quot;. It has been suggested that his clerical status forbade him from using a sword, though this is doubtful: the club was a common weapon and used often by leadership including by Duke William himself, as also depicted in the same part of the Tapestry. Odo was accompanied by William the carrier of his crozier and a retinue of servants and members of his household.

In 1067, Odo became Earl of Kent, and for some years he was a trusted royal minister. On some occasions when William was absent (back in Normandy), he served as regent of England, and at times he led the royal forces against rebellions (e.g. the Revolt of the Earls): the precise sphere of his powers is not certain. There are also other occasions when he accompanied William back to Normandy.

During this time Odo acquired vast estates in England, larger in extent than anyone except the king: he had land in twenty-three counties, primarily in the south east and in East Anglia.

==Trial, imprisonment and rebellion==
In 1076, at the trial of Penenden Heath, Odo was tried in front of a large and senior assembly over the course of three days at Penenden Heath in Kent for defrauding the Crown and the Diocese of Canterbury. At the conclusion of the trial he was forced to return a number of properties and his assets were re-apportioned.

In 1082, Odo was suddenly disgraced and imprisoned for having planned a military expedition to Italy. His motives are not certain. Chroniclers writing a generation later said Odo desired to make himself pope during the Investiture Controversy while Pope Gregory VII was in severe difficulty in his conflict with Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and the position of pope was in contention; but the contemporary evidence is ambiguous. Whatever the reason, Odo spent the next five years in prison and his English estates were taken back by the king, as was his office as Earl of Kent. Odo was not deposed as Bishop of Bayeux.

On his deathbed in 1087, King William I was reluctantly persuaded by his half-brother, Robert, Count of Mortain, to release Odo. After the king&#x27;s death, Odo returned to England. William&#x27;s eldest son, Robert Curthose, had been made duke of Normandy, while Robert&#x27;s brother William Rufus had received the throne of England. The bishop supported Robert Curthose&#x27;s claim to England. The Rebellion of 1088 failed and William Rufus permitted Odo to leave the kingdom. Afterwards, Odo remained in the service of Robert in Normandy.

Odo joined the First Crusade as part of his nephew Robert&#x27;s army that was bound for Jerusalem, but died on the way whilst visiting Palermo in January or February 1097. He was buried in Palermo Cathedral.

==Commentary on Odo==
William Stearns Davis writes in &quot;Life on a Medieval Barony&quot; (1923):
Bishop Odo of Bayeux fought at Hastings (1066) before any such authorized champions of the church existed. ... That bishops shall restrain from warfare is really a pious wish not easily in this sinful world to be granted.
==Portrayals on screen==
On screen, Odo has been portrayed by John Nettleton in the two-part BBC TV play &quot;Conquest&quot; (1966), part of the series &quot;Theatre 625&quot;, and by Denis Lill in the TV drama &quot;Blood Royal: William the Conqueror&quot; (1990).

<doc id="113302" wikidata="Q170749" url="?curid=113302" title="Surface tension">
<text>Surface tension is the tendency of liquid surfaces at rest to shrink into the minimum surface area possible. Surface tension is what allows objects with a higher density than water such as razor blades and insects (e.g. water striders) to float on a water surface without becoming even partly submerged.

At liquid–air interfaces, surface tension results from the greater attraction of liquid molecules to each other (due to cohesion) than to the molecules in the air (due to adhesion).

There are two primary mechanisms in play. One is an inward force on the surface molecules causing the liquid to contract. Second is a tangential force parallel to the surface of the liquid. This &quot;tangential&quot; force is generally referred to as the surface tension. The net effect is the liquid behaves as if its surface were covered with a stretched elastic membrane. But this analogy must not be taken too far as the tension in an elastic membrane is dependent on the amount of deformation of the membrane while surface tension is an inherent property of the liquid&quot;–&quot;air or liquid&quot;–&quot;vapour interface.

Because of the relatively high attraction of water molecules to each other through a web of hydrogen bonds, water has a higher surface tension (72.8 millinewtons (mN) per meter at 20 °C) than most other liquids. Surface tension is an important factor in the phenomenon of capillarity.

Surface tension has the dimension of force per unit length, or of energy per unit area. The two are equivalent, but when referring to energy per unit of area, it is common to use the term surface energy, which is a more general term in the sense that it applies also to solids.

In materials science, surface tension is used for either surface stress or surface energy.

==Causes==

Due to the cohesive forces, a molecule located away from the surface is pulled equally in every direction by neighboring liquid molecules, resulting in a net force of zero. The molecules at the surface do not have the &quot;same&quot; molecules on all sides of them and therefore are pulled inward. This creates some internal pressure and forces liquid surfaces to contract to the minimum area.

There is also a tension parallel to the surface at the liquid-air interface which will resist an external force, due to the cohesive nature of water molecules.

The forces of attraction acting between molecules of the same type are called cohesive forces, while those acting between molecules of different types are called adhesive forces. The balance between the cohesion of the liquid and its adhesion to the material of the container determines the degree of wetting, the contact angle, and the shape of meniscus. When cohesion dominates (specifically, adhesion energy is less than half of cohesion energy) the wetting is low and the meniscus is convex at a vertical wall (as for mercury in a glass container). On the other hand, when adhesion dominates (when adhesion energy is more than half of cohesion energy) the wetting is high and the similar meniscus is concave (as in water in a glass).

Surface tension is responsible for the shape of liquid droplets. Although easily deformed, droplets of water tend to be pulled into a spherical shape by the imbalance in cohesive forces of the surface layer. In the absence of other forces, drops of virtually all liquids would be approximately spherical. The spherical shape minimizes the necessary &quot;wall tension&quot; of the surface layer according to Laplace&#x27;s law.
Another way to view surface tension is in terms of energy. A molecule in contact with a neighbor is in a lower state of energy than if it were alone. The interior molecules have as many neighbors as they can possibly have, but the boundary molecules are missing neighbors (compared to interior molecules) and therefore have higher energy. For the liquid to minimize its energy state, the number of higher energy boundary molecules must be minimized. The minimized number of boundary molecules results in a minimal surface area.
As a result of surface area minimization, a surface will assume a smooth shape.

== Physics ==

=== Physical units ===
Surface tension, represented by the symbol &quot;γ&quot; (alternatively &quot;σ&quot; or &quot;T&quot;), is measured in force per unit length. Its SI unit is newton per meter but the cgs unit of dyne per centimeter is also used. For example,
formula_1

=== Definition ===

Surface tension can be defined in terms of force or energy.

==== In terms of force ====
Surface tension of a liquid is the force per unit length. In the illustration on the right, the rectangular frame, composed of three unmovable sides (black) that form a &quot;U&quot; shape, and a fourth movable side (blue) that can slide to the right. Surface tension will pull the blue bar to the left; the force required to hold the movable side is proportional to the length of the immobile side. Thus the ratio depends only on the intrinsic properties of the liquid (composition, temperature, etc.), not on its geometry. For example, if the frame had a more complicated shape, the ratio , with the length of the movable side and the force required to stop it from sliding, is found to be the same for all shapes. We therefore define the surface tension as

formula_2
The reason for the is that the film has two sides (two surfaces), each of which contributes equally to the force; so the force contributed by a single side is .

==== In terms of energy ====
Surface tension of a liquid is the ratio of the change in the energy of the liquid to the change in the surface area of the liquid (that led to the change in energy). This can be easily related to the previous definition in terms of force: if is the force required to stop the side from &quot;starting&quot; to slide, then this is also the force that would keep the side in the state of &quot;sliding at a constant speed&quot; (by Newton&#x27;s Second Law). But if the side is moving to the right (in the direction the force is applied), then the surface area of the stretched liquid is increasing while the applied force is doing work on the liquid. This means that increasing the surface area increases the energy of the film. The work done by the force in moving the side by distance is ; at the same time the total area of the film increases by (the factor of 2 is here because the liquid has two sides, two surfaces). Thus, multiplying both the numerator and the denominator of by , we get
formula_3
This work is, by the usual arguments, interpreted as being stored as potential energy. Consequently, surface tension can be also measured in SI system as joules per square meter and in the cgs system as ergs per cm2. Since mechanical systems try to find a state of minimum potential energy, a free droplet of liquid naturally assumes a spherical shape, which has the minimum surface area for a given volume.
The equivalence of measurement of energy per unit area to force per unit length can be proven by dimensional analysis.
==Effects==

===Water===
Several effects of surface tension can be seen with ordinary water:

===Surfactants===
Surface tension is visible in other common phenomena, especially when surfactants are used to decrease it:

* Soap bubbles have very large surface areas with very little mass. Bubbles in pure water are unstable. The addition of surfactants, however, can have a stabilizing effect on the bubbles (see Marangoni effect). Surfactants actually reduce the surface tension of water by a factor of three or more.
* Emulsions are a type of colloidal dispersion in which surface tension plays a role. Tiny droplets of oil dispersed in pure water will spontaneously coalesce and phase separate. The addition of surfactants reduces the interfacial tension and allow for the formation of oil droplets in the water medium (or vice versa). The stability of such formed oil droplets depends on many different chemical and environmental factors.

===Surface curvature and pressure===
If no force acts normal to a tensioned surface, the surface must remain flat. But if the pressure on one side of the surface differs from pressure on the other side, the pressure difference times surface area results in a normal force. In order for the surface tension forces to cancel the force due to pressure, the surface must be curved. The diagram shows how surface curvature of a tiny patch of surface leads to a net component of surface tension forces acting normal to the center of the patch. When all the forces are balanced, the resulting equation is known as the Young–Laplace equation:
formula_4
where:
* is the pressure difference, known as the Laplace pressure.
* is surface tension.
* and are radii of curvature in each of the axes that are parallel to the surface.
The quantity in parentheses on the right hand side is in fact (twice) the mean curvature of the surface (depending on normalisation).
Solutions to this equation determine the shape of water drops, puddles, menisci, soap bubbles, and all other shapes determined by surface tension (such as the shape of the impressions that a water strider&#x27;s feet make on the surface of a pond).
The table below shows how the internal pressure of a water droplet increases with decreasing radius. For not very small drops the effect is subtle, but the pressure difference becomes enormous when the drop sizes approach the molecular size. (In the limit of a single molecule the concept becomes meaningless.)


=== Floating objects ===
When an object is placed on a liquid, its weight depresses the surface, and if surface tension and downward force become equal then it is balanced by the surface tension forces on either side , which are each parallel to the water&#x27;s surface at the points where it contacts the object. Notice that small movement in the body may cause the object to sink. As the angle of contact decreases, surface tension decreases. The horizontal components of the two arrows point in opposite directions, so they cancel each other, but the vertical components point in the same direction and therefore add up to balance . The object&#x27;s surface must not be wettable for this to happen, and its weight must be low enough for the surface tension to support it. If denotes the mass of the needle and acceleration due to gravity, we have

formula_5

===Liquid surface===

To find the shape of the minimal surface bounded by some arbitrary shaped frame using strictly mathematical means can be a daunting task. Yet by fashioning the frame out of wire and dipping it in soap-solution, a locally minimal surface will appear in the resulting soap-film within seconds.

The reason for this is that the pressure difference across a fluid interface is proportional to the mean curvature, as seen in the Young–Laplace equation. For an open soap film, the pressure difference is zero, hence the mean curvature is zero, and minimal surfaces have the property of zero mean curvature.

===Contact angles===

The surface of any liquid is an interface between that liquid and some other medium. The top surface of a pond, for example, is an interface between the pond water and the air. Surface tension, then, is not a property of the liquid alone, but a property of the liquid&#x27;s interface with another medium. If a liquid is in a container, then besides the liquid/air interface at its top surface, there is also an interface between the liquid and the walls of the container. The surface tension between the liquid and air is usually different (greater) than its surface tension with the walls of a container. And where the two surfaces meet, their geometry must be such that all forces balance.

Where the two surfaces meet, they form a contact angle, , which is the angle the tangent to the surface makes with the solid surface. Note that the angle is measured &quot;through the liquid&quot;, as shown in the diagrams above. The diagram to the right shows two examples. Tension forces are shown for the liquid–air interface, the liquid–solid interface, and the solid–air interface. The example on the left is where the difference between the liquid–solid and solid–air surface tension, , is less than the liquid–air surface tension, , but is nevertheless positive, that is

formula_6

In the diagram, both the vertical and horizontal forces must cancel exactly at the contact point, known as equilibrium. The horizontal component of is canceled by the adhesive force, .

formula_7

The more telling balance of forces, though, is in the vertical direction. The vertical component of must exactly cancel the difference of the forces along the solid surface, .

formula_8

Since the forces are in direct proportion to their respective surface tensions, we also have:

formula_9

where
* is the liquid–solid surface tension,
* is the liquid–air surface tension,
* is the solid–air surface tension,
* is the contact angle, where a concave meniscus has contact angle less than 90° and a convex meniscus has contact angle of greater than 90°.

This means that although the difference between the liquid–solid and solid–air surface tension, , is difficult to measure directly, it can be inferred from the liquid–air surface tension, , and the equilibrium contact angle, , which is a function of the easily measurable advancing and receding contact angles (see main article contact angle).

This same relationship exists in the diagram on the right. But in this case we see that because the contact angle is less than 90°, the liquid–solid/solid–air surface tension difference must be negative:

formula_10

====Special contact angles====
Observe that in the special case of a water–silver interface where the contact angle is equal to 90°, the liquid–solid/solid–air surface tension difference is exactly zero.

Another special case is where the contact angle is exactly 180°. Water with specially prepared Teflon approaches this. Contact angle of 180° occurs when the liquid–solid surface tension is exactly equal to the liquid–air surface tension.

formula_11
===Liquid in a vertical tube===

An old style mercury barometer consists of a vertical glass tube about 1 cm in diameter partially filled with mercury, and with a vacuum (called Torricelli&#x27;s vacuum) in the unfilled volume (see diagram to the right). Notice that the mercury level at the center of the tube is higher than at the edges, making the upper surface of the mercury dome-shaped. The center of mass of the entire column of mercury would be slightly lower if the top surface of the mercury were flat over the entire cross-section of the tube. But the dome-shaped top gives slightly less surface area to the entire mass of mercury. Again the two effects combine to minimize the total potential energy. Such a surface shape is known as a convex meniscus.

We consider the surface area of the entire mass of mercury, including the part of the surface that is in contact with the glass, because mercury does not adhere to glass at all. So the surface tension of the mercury acts over its entire surface area, including where it is in contact with the glass. If instead of glass, the tube was made out of copper, the situation would be very different. Mercury aggressively adheres to copper. So in a copper tube, the level of mercury at the center of the tube will be lower than at the edges (that is, it would be a concave meniscus). In a situation where the liquid adheres to the walls of its container, we consider the part of the fluid&#x27;s surface area that is in contact with the container to have &quot;negative&quot; surface tension. The fluid then works to maximize the contact surface area. So in this case increasing the area in contact with the container decreases rather than increases the potential energy. That decrease is enough to compensate for the increased potential energy associated with lifting the fluid near the walls of the container.


If a tube is sufficiently narrow and the liquid adhesion to its walls is sufficiently strong, surface tension can draw liquid up the tube in a phenomenon known as capillary action. The height to which the column is lifted is given by Jurin&#x27;s law:

formula_12

where

* is the height the liquid is lifted,
* is the liquid–air surface tension,
* is the density of the liquid,
* is the radius of the capillary,
* is the acceleration due to gravity,
* is the angle of contact described above. If is greater than 90°, as with mercury in a glass container, the liquid will be depressed rather than lifted.
===Puddles on a surface===

Pouring mercury onto a horizontal flat sheet of glass results in a puddle that has a perceptible thickness. The puddle will spread out only to the point where it is a little under half a centimetre thick, and no thinner. Again this is due to the action of mercury&#x27;s strong surface tension. The liquid mass flattens out because that brings as much of the mercury to as low a level as possible, but the surface tension, at the same time, is acting to reduce the total surface area. The result of the compromise is a puddle of a nearly fixed thickness.

The same surface tension demonstration can be done with water, lime water or even saline, but only on a surface made of a substance to which water does not adhere. Wax is such a substance. Water poured onto a smooth, flat, horizontal wax surface, say a waxed sheet of glass, will behave similarly to the mercury poured onto glass.

The thickness of a puddle of liquid on a surface whose contact angle is 180° is given by:

formula_13

where

* is the depth of the puddle in centimeters or meters.
* is the surface tension of the liquid in dynes per centimeter or newtons per meter.
* is the acceleration due to gravity and is equal to 980 cm/s2 or 9.8 m/s2
* is the density of the liquid in grams per cubic centimeter or kilograms per cubic meter

In reality, the thicknesses of the puddles will be slightly less than what is predicted by the above formula because very few surfaces have a contact angle of 180° with any liquid. When the contact angle is less than 180°, the thickness is given by:

formula_14

For mercury on glass, = 487 dyn/cm, = 13.5 g/cm3 and = 140°, which gives = 0.36 cm. For water on paraffin at 25 °C, = 72 dyn/cm, = 1.0 g/cm3, and = 107° which gives = 0.44 cm.

The formula also predicts that when the contact angle is 0°, the liquid will spread out into a micro-thin layer over the surface. Such a surface is said to be fully wettable by the liquid.

===Breakup of streams into drops===

In day-to-day life all of us observe that a stream of water emerging from a faucet will break up into droplets, no matter how smoothly the stream is emitted from the faucet. This is due to a phenomenon called the Plateau–Rayleigh instability, which is entirely a consequence of the effects of surface tension.

The explanation of this instability begins with the existence of tiny perturbations in the stream. These are always present, no matter how smooth the stream is. If the perturbations are resolved into sinusoidal components, we find that some components grow with time while others decay with time. Among those that grow with time, some grow at faster rates than others. Whether a component decays or grows, and how fast it grows is entirely a function of its wave number (a measure of how many peaks and troughs per centimeter) and the radii of the original cylindrical stream.

===Thermodynamic theories of surface tension===

J.W. Gibbs developed the thermodynamic theory of capillarity based
on the idea of surfaces of discontinuity. Gibbs considered the case of a sharp mathematical surface being placed somewhere within the microscopically fuzzy physical interface that exists between two homogeneous substances. Realizing that the exact choice of the surface&#x27;s location was somewhat arbitrary, he left it flexible. Since the interface exists in thermal and chemical equilibrium with the substances around it (having temperature and chemical potentials ), Gibbs considered the case where the surface may have excess energy, excess entropy, and excess particles, finding the natural free energy function in this case to be formula_15, a quantity later named as the grand potential and given the symbol formula_16.

Considering a given subvolume formula_17 containing a surface of discontinuity, the volume is divided by the mathematical surface into two parts A and B, with volumes formula_18 and formula_19, with formula_20 exactly. Now, if the two parts A and B were homogeneous fluids (with pressures formula_21, formula_22) and remained perfectly homogeneous right up to the mathematical boundary, without any surface effects, the total grand potential of this volume would be simply formula_23. The surface effects of interest are a modification to this, and they can be all collected into a surface free energy term formula_24 so the total grand potential of the volume becomes:
formula_25

For sufficiently macroscopic and gently curved surfaces, the surface free energy must simply be proportional to the surface area:
formula_26
for surface tension formula_27 and surface area formula_28.

As stated above, this implies the mechanical work needed to increase a surface area &quot;A&quot; is , assuming the volumes on each side do not change. Thermodynamics requires that for systems held at constant chemical potential and temperature, all spontaneous changes of state are accompanied by a decrease in this free energy formula_16, that is, an increase in total entropy taking into account the possible movement of energy and particles from the surface into the surrounding fluids. From this it is easy to understand why decreasing the surface area of a mass of liquid is always spontaneous, provided it is not coupled to any other energy changes. It follows that in order to increase surface area, a certain amount of energy must be added.

Gibbs and other scientists have wrestled with the arbitrariness in the exact microscopic placement of the surface. For microscopic surfaces with very tight curvatures, it is not correct to assume the surface tension is independent of size, and topics like the Tolman length come into play. For a macroscopic-sized surface (and planar surfaces), the surface placement does not have a significant effect on ; however, it does have a very strong effect on the values of the surface entropy, surface excess mass densities, and surface internal energy, which are the partial derivatives of the surface tension function formula_30.

Gibbs emphasized that for solids, the surface free energy may be completely different from surface stress (what he called surface tension): the surface free energy is the work required to &quot;form&quot; the surface, while surface stress is the work required to &quot;stretch&quot; the surface. In the case of a two-fluid interface, there is no distinction between forming and stretching because the fluids and the surface completely replenish their nature when the surface is stretched. For a solid, stretching the surface, even elastically, results in a fundamentally changed surface. Further, the surface stress on a solid is a directional quantity (a stress tensor) while surface energy is scalar.

Fifteen years after Gibbs, J.D. van der Waals developed the theory of capillarity effects based on the hypothesis of a continuous variation of density. He added to the energy density the term formula_31 where &quot;c&quot; is the capillarity coefficient and &quot;ρ&quot; is the density. For the multiphase &quot;equilibria&quot;, the results of the van der Waals approach practically coincide with the Gibbs formulae, but for modelling of the &quot;dynamics&quot; of phase transitions the van der Waals approach is much more convenient. The van der Waals capillarity energy is now widely used in the phase field models of multiphase flows. Such terms are also discovered in the dynamics of non-equilibrium gases.

===Thermodynamics of bubbles===
The pressure inside an ideal spherical bubble can be derived from thermodynamic free energy considerations. The above free energy can be written as:
formula_32
where formula_33 is the pressure difference between the inside (A) and outside (B) of the bubble, and formula_18 is the bubble volume. In equilibrium, , and so,
formula_35

For a spherical bubble, the volume and surface area are given simply by
formula_36
and
formula_37

Substituting these relations into the previous expression, we find
formula_38
which is equivalent to the Young–Laplace equation when .

====Influence of temperature====

Surface tension is dependent on temperature. For that reason, when a value is given for the surface tension of an interface, temperature must be explicitly stated. The general trend is that surface tension decreases with the increase of temperature, reaching a value of 0 at the critical temperature. For further details see Eötvös rule. There are only empirical equations to relate surface tension and temperature:
* Eötvös: formula_39 Here is the molar volume of a substance, is the critical temperature and is a constant valid for almost all substances. A typical value is = . For water one can further use = 18 ml/mol and = 647 K (374 °C). A variant on Eötvös is described by Ramay and Shields: formula_40 where the temperature offset of 6 K provides the formula with a better fit to reality at lower temperatures.
* Guggenheim–Katayama: formula_41 is a constant for each liquid and is an empirical factor, whose value is for organic liquids. This equation was also proposed by van der Waals, who further proposed that could be given by the expression formula_42 where is a universal constant for all liquids, and is the critical pressure of the liquid (although later experiments found to vary to some degree from one liquid to another).

Both Guggenheim–Katayama and Eötvös take into account the fact that surface tension reaches 0 at the critical temperature, whereas Ramay and Shields fails to match reality at this endpoint.

====Influence of solute concentration====
Solutes can have different effects on surface tension depending on the nature of the surface and the solute:
* Little or no effect, for example sugar at water|air, most organic compounds at oil/air
* Increase surface tension, most inorganic salts at water|air
* Non-monotonic change, most inorganic acids at water|air
* Decrease surface tension progressively, as with most amphiphiles, e.g., alcohols at water|air
* Decrease surface tension until certain critical concentration, and no effect afterwards: surfactants that form micelles

What complicates the effect is that a solute can exist in a different concentration at the surface of a solvent than in its bulk. This difference varies from one solute–solvent combination to another.

Gibbs isotherm states that:
formula_43

* is known as surface concentration, it represents excess of solute per unit area of the surface over what would be present if the bulk concentration prevailed all the way to the surface. It has units of mol/m2
* is the concentration of the substance in the bulk solution.
* is the gas constant and the temperature

Certain assumptions are taken in its deduction, therefore Gibbs isotherm can only be applied to ideal (very dilute) solutions with two components.

====Influence of particle size on vapor pressure====

The Clausius–Clapeyron relation leads to another equation also attributed to Kelvin, as the Kelvin equation. It explains why, because of surface tension, the vapor pressure for small droplets of liquid in suspension is greater than standard vapor pressure of that same liquid when the interface is flat. That is to say that when a liquid is forming small droplets, the equilibrium concentration of its vapor in its surroundings is greater. This arises because the pressure inside the droplet is greater than outside.

formula_44

* is the standard vapor pressure for that liquid at that temperature and pressure.
* is the molar volume.
* is the gas constant
* is the Kelvin radius, the radius of the droplets.

The effect explains supersaturation of vapors. In the absence of nucleation sites, tiny droplets must form before they can evolve into larger droplets. This requires a vapor pressure many times the vapor pressure at the phase transition point.

This equation is also used in catalyst chemistry to assess mesoporosity for solids.

The effect can be viewed in terms of the average number of molecular neighbors of surface molecules (see diagram).

The table shows some calculated values of this effect for water at different drop sizes:

The effect becomes clear for very small drop sizes, as a drop of 1 nm radius has about 100 molecules inside, which is a quantity small enough to require a quantum mechanics analysis.

==Methods of measurement==

Because surface tension manifests itself in various effects, it offers a number of paths to its measurement. Which method is optimal depends upon the nature of the liquid being measured, the conditions under which its tension is to be measured, and the stability of its surface when it is deformed. An instrument that measures surface tension is called tensiometer.

* Du Noüy ring method: The traditional method used to measure surface or interfacial tension. Wetting properties of the surface or interface have little influence on this measuring technique. Maximum pull exerted on the ring by the surface is measured.
*Wilhelmy plate method: A universal method especially suited to check surface tension over long time intervals. A vertical plate of known perimeter is attached to a balance, and the force due to wetting is measured.
* Spinning drop method: This technique is ideal for measuring low interfacial tensions. The diameter of a drop within a heavy phase is measured while both are rotated.
* Pendant drop method: Surface and interfacial tension can be measured by this technique, even at elevated temperatures and pressures. Geometry of a drop is analyzed optically. For pendant drops the maximum diameter and the ratio between this parameter and the diameter at the distance of the maximum diameter from the drop apex has been used to evaluate the size and shape parameters in order to determine surface tension.
* Bubble pressure method (Jaeger&#x27;s method): A measurement technique for determining surface tension at short surface ages. Maximum pressure of each bubble is measured.
* Drop volume method: A method for determining interfacial tension as a function of interface age. Liquid of one density is pumped into a second liquid of a different density and time between drops produced is measured.
* Capillary rise method: The end of a capillary is immersed into the solution. The height at which the solution reaches inside the capillary is related to the surface tension by the equation discussed above.
* Stalagmometric method: A method of weighting and reading a drop of liquid.
* Sessile drop method: A method for determining surface tension and density by placing a drop on a substrate and measuring the contact angle (see Sessile drop technique).
*Du Noüy–Padday method: A minimized version of Du Noüy method uses a small diameter metal needle instead of a ring, in combination with a high sensitivity microbalance to record maximum pull. The advantage of this method is that very small sample volumes (down to few tens of microliters) can be measured with very high precision, without the need to correct for buoyancy (for a needle or rather, rod, with proper geometry). Further, the measurement can be performed very quickly, minimally in about 20 seconds.
* Vibrational frequency of levitated drops: The natural frequency of vibrational oscillations of magnetically levitated drops has been used to measure the surface tension of superfluid 4He. This value is estimated to be 0.375 dyn/cm at = 0 K.
* Resonant oscillations of spherical and hemispherical liquid drop: The technique is based on measuring the resonant frequency of spherical and hemispherical pendant droplets driven in oscillations by a modulated electric field. The surface tension and viscosity can be evaluated from the obtained resonant curves.
* Drop-bounce method: This method is based on aerodynamic levitation with a split-able nozzle design. After dropping a stably levitated droplet onto a platform, the sample deforms and bounces back, oscillating in mid-air as it tries to minimize its surface area. Through this oscillation behavior, the liquid&#x27;s surface tension and viscosity can be measured.

===Surface tension of water===

The surface tension of pure liquid water in contact with its vapor has been given by IAPWS as

formula_45

where both and the critical temperature = 647.096 K are expressed in kelvins. The region of validity the entire vapor–liquid saturation curve, from the triple point (0.01 °C) to the critical point. It also provides reasonable results when extrapolated to metastable (supercooled) conditions, down to at least −25 °C. This formulation was originally adopted by IAPWS in 1976 and was adjusted in 1994 to conform to the International Temperature Scale of 1990.

The uncertainty of this formulation is given over the full range of temperature by IAPWS. For temperatures below 100 °C, the uncertainty is ±0.5%.

===Surface tension of seawater===

Nayar et al. published reference data for the surface tension of seawater over the salinity range of and a temperature range of at atmospheric pressure. The range of temperature and salinity encompasses both the oceanographic range and the range of conditions encountered in thermal desalination technologies. The uncertainty of the measurements varied from 0.18 to 0.37 mN/m with the average uncertainty being 0.22 mN/m.

Nayar et al. correlated the data with the following equation
formula_46
where is the surface tension of seawater in mN/m, is the surface tension of water in mN/m, is the reference salinity in g/kg, and is temperature in degrees Celsius. The average absolute percentage deviation between measurements and the correlation was 0.19% while the maximum deviation is 0.60%.

The International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS) has adopted this correlation as an international standard guideline.

<text>Embleton is a village and civil parish in the English county of Northumberland. Besides the village of Embleton itself, the civil parish includes the settlement of Christon Bank, situated about a mile to the west.

Embleton village has a main street with one shop. There is a small green with the village pump on it, out of use now but at one time the source of the water supply. The village is about from Embleton Bay. The sandy beach is backed by dunes where a variety of flowers bloom: bluebells, cowslips, burnet roses and bloody cranesbill, amongst others. Also near the beach is Embleton&#x27;s 18-hole Dunstanburgh Castle Golf Course which opened in 1900 and was updated in 1922.

Christon Bank lies on the East Coast Main Line railway, and until 1965 was the site of a station.

Beyond the bounds of the parish, Dunstanburgh Castle stands at the southern end of Embleton Bay. Close by, to the south, is the fishing village of Craster.

== Landmarks ==
Close by the church is Embleton Tower, a pele tower which was the vicarage until 1974.

The Creighton Memorial Hall is said to be the largest village hall in the county and is named after Mandell Creighton, who was vicar 1875–1884 and later became Bishop of London.

One road is named after the Embleton-born W. T. Stead, a journalist and social campaigner who died in the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;.

== Religious sites ==
The Church of the Holy Trinity is large with several interesting features and is historically connected with Merton College, Oxford. Creighton, the vicar, had a poor opinion of the villagers:
&quot;In many ways the moral standard of the village was very low, and it was a difficult place to improve. There was no resident squire, the chief employers of labour were on much the same level of cultivation as those they employed, and in some cases owned the public-houses and paid the wages there.&quot;

==Notable people==

* Robert de Emeldon (died 1355), Lord Treasurer of Ireland, and a personal friend of King Edward III, was born in Embleton in the thirteenth century. 
* Richard de Emeldon, who was Robert&#x27;s cousin, and was later five times mayor of Newcastle upon Tyne and one of its leading citizens, was also born here.
* W. T. Stead, journalist and social campaigner.

<doc id="113319" wikidata="Q837545" url="?curid=113319" title="Lulu (opera)">
<text>Lulu (composed from 1929 to 1935, premièred incomplete in 1937 and complete in 1979) is an opera in three acts by Alban Berg. Berg adapted the libretto from Frank Wedekind&#x27;s two &quot;Lulu&quot; plays, &quot;Erdgeist&quot; (&quot;Earth Spirit&quot;, 1895) and &quot;Die Büchse der Pandora&quot; (&quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;, 1904). Berg died before completing the third and final act, and the opera was typically performed as a &quot;torso&quot; until Friedrich Cerha&#x27;s 1979 orchestration of the act 3 sketches, which is now established as the standard version. &quot;Lulu&quot; is notable for using twelve-tone technique during a time that was particularly inhospitable to it. Theodor W. Adorno praised it as &quot;one of those works that reveals the extent of its quality the longer and more deeply one immerses oneself in it.&quot;

The opera tells the story of Lulu, an ambiguous in the fin de siècle, through a series of chiastic structures in both the music and drama alike. Introduced allegorically and symbolically as a serpent in the prologue, she survives three dysfunctional marriages while navigating a network of alternately dangerous and devoted admirers. Her first husband, the physician, dies of stroke upon finding her with the painter. Her second husband, the painter, dies by suicide when he learns that she is being married off and has been sexually exploited since childhood by the businessman, among others. This latter man, she says, was &quot;the only one&quot; who &quot;rescued&quot; and &quot;loved&quot; her. She convinces him to become her third husband but kills him when he becomes paranoid and violent. She escapes prison with the help of her lesbian admirer, the Countess Geschwitz, and they flee to London with her lover (and last husband&#x27;s son) Alwa. But they are ruined by a stock market crash, reducing her to prostitution. One of her clients beats Alwa to death, and the next, Jack the Ripper, murders Lulu and Geschwitz.

==History==

=== Sources ===
Berg was familiar with Wedekind&#x27;s &quot;Erdgeist&quot; by 1903, when he was 19. He also saw &quot;Die Büchse der Pandora&quot; in 1905 in a production by Karl Kraus on 29 May, and was inspired by the introductory speech that Kraus delivered on that occasion. In Wedekind&#x27;s two &quot;Lulu&quot; plays, now often performed together under that title, &quot;Erdgeist&quot; forms the basis for the act 1 and act 2, scene 1, of the opera culminating in her shooting Dr. Schön, while &quot;Die Büchse der Pandora&quot; forms the basis for the rest of act 2 and act 3, Lulu&#x27;s imprisonment, escape and subsequent decline and murder.

=== Composition ===
Berg did not begin work on &quot;Lulu&quot; until 1929, after he had completed his other opera, &quot;Wozzeck&quot;. Thanks to &quot;Wozzeck&quot;″s success Berg had economic security that enabled him to embark on a second opera. But life in the musical world was becoming increasingly difficult in the 1930s in both Vienna and Germany due to rising antisemitism and the Nazi cultural ideology that denounced the music of Berg, Webern, and others. Even to have an association with someone Jewish could lead to denunciation, and Berg had studied with the Jewish composer Arnold Schoenberg. &quot;Wozzeck&quot;&#x27;s success was short-lived, as theatre after theatre succumbed to political pressure and refused to produce it, Erich Kleiber&#x27;s 30 November 1932 production being the last, while sets and scenery were systematically destroyed. &quot;Wozzeck&quot; was also banned in the Soviet Union as &quot;bourgeois&quot;. Berg found that opportunities for his work to be performed in Germany were growing scarce, and in September 1935 his music was proscribed as &quot;Entartete Musik&quot; (degenerate music) under the label &quot;Kulturbolschewismus&quot; (Cultural Bolshevism).

Despite these conditions, Berg worked on &quot;Lulu&quot; in seclusion at his lodge, the &quot;Waldhaus&quot;, in Carinthia. In the spring of 1934 he learned from Wilhelm Furtwängler that production of &quot;Lulu&quot; in Berlin would be impossible with the current cultural and political situation. It was at this point that he set the work on the opera aside to prepare a concert suite, in the event that the opera could never be performed, and also considered expanding it into a &quot;Lulu&quot; Symphony. This was his &quot;Symphonische Stücke aus der Oper &quot;Lulu&quot;&quot; (&quot;Lulu Suite&quot;) for soprano and orchestra. Kleiber performed the piece at the Berlin State Opera on 30 November, and despite an enthusiastic reception by some sections of the audience, condemnation by the authorities prompted Kleiber&#x27;s resignation four days later and departure from Germany. The reaction of periodicals such as &quot;Die Musik&quot; and &quot;Zeitschrift für Musik&quot; was particularly hostile. On December 7, Goebbels made a speech equating atonality with &quot;the Jewish intellectual infection,&quot; while the January 1935 issue of &quot;Die Musik&quot; suggested that any reviewer who had written anything favourable about the suite should be dismissed.

In January 1935, the Russian-born American violinist Louis Krasner, who had championed Berg&#x27;s work in the United States, approached Berg to commission a violin concerto. Berg was reluctant to set aside &quot;Lulu&quot; for this, but the money ($1,500) was welcomed, as Berg was in financial difficulties, financially and artistically ruined by the &quot;Reichskulturkammer&quot; (Nazi cultural committee). At first there was only a tentative agreement, but at the end of March he told Krasner he would compose it and had started some preliminary work. But it was the tragic death of 18-year-old Manon Gropius (the daughter of Walter Gropius and Alma Mahler, whom the Bergs treated as their own daughter) on April 22 that prompted Berg to set aside &quot;Lulu&quot; for the concerto, which he dedicated to her. The concerto was completed swiftly, between April and August of that year, but the time he spent on it prevented him from completing the opera before his sudden death on December 24.

The following portions of the third and final act were fully scored: the first 268 bars; the instrumental interlude between scenes 1 and 2; and the finale of the opera, beginning with the monologue of Countess Geschwitz. (The last two of these passages comprise the fourth and fifth movements of the &quot;Lulu Suite&quot; that Berg compiled for concert performance.) The rest of the work remained in short score with indications of instrumentation for much of it. Berg heard the Symphonic Pieces in a BBC radio broadcast from the Queen&#x27;s Hall, London, on 20 March 1935, conducted by Sir Adrian Boult and produced by Edward Clark. It was the first time he had ever heard any of the music of &quot;Lulu&quot;. He did not hear these excerpts performed live until a concert in Vienna on December 11, a fortnight before his death.

==Roles==

Berg specified that a number of cast members should take more than one role. Thus, the singers of Lulu&#x27;s three husbands return as her clients while a prostitute: one performer each appears as the Doctor and the Professor, as the Painter and the Negro, and as Dr. Schön and Jack the Ripper. Other specified combinations are one mezzo-soprano as the Dresser, the Schoolboy, and the Groom; one tenor as the Prince, the Manservant, and the Marquis; one bass as the Animal Tamer and the Athlete, and another bass as the Theatre Manager and the Banker. Another aspect of the cast list that differs from Wedekind&#x27;s original is that all characters in the two plays receive a proper name. Berg removed these names except for the five leading roles of Lulu, Schön, Alwa, Geschwitz and Schigolch. Some of Wedekind&#x27;s other names have sometimes been applied to Berg&#x27;s characters; for example, the Athlete is often called &quot;Rodrigo Quast&quot;, but this name is not in the score.

Berg perhaps modeled the Geschwitz role on his lesbian sister Smaragda, Dr. Schön on Arnold Schoenberg, the Painter on Richard Gerstl, Schigolch on his wife Helene&#x27;s biological father (perhaps Franz Joseph I of Austria), and Alwa on himself, among other semiautobiographical and allegorical elements, according to Olaf Winnecke. The physician Dr. Goll, as in &quot;Wozzeck&quot;, may represent society.

==Synopsis==
In the Prologue, a circus animal tamer introduces Lulu symbolically as a serpent and the other roles likewise as various &quot;domesticated&quot; animals (&quot;Hereinspaziert in die Menagerie!&quot;).

In Act 1, Lulu is being painted in a late 19th-century studio in a city like Vienna. Dr. Schön and his son Alwa, a composer and admirer, are visiting. When they leave, the Painter ravishes her (&quot;Gnädige Frau ...&quot;). Dr. Goll, her physician husband, finds them and dies of stroke. Lulu inherits his wealth (Verwandlungsmusik I). Later in scene 2, the Painter has happily married her, but one day news of Schön&#x27;s engagement angers her (&quot;Eva? – Befehlen?&quot;). Since childhood, she has been sexually groomed (she says &quot;rescued&quot; and &quot;loved&quot;) by the elder Schön, who is trying to discard her. The same day, the asthmatic Schigolch, who may or may not be Lulu&#x27;s father or another one of her lovers, had visited them as a beggar. Schön explains these matters to the Painter so that he may properly &quot;handle&quot; Lulu. But the Painter reaches his breaking point, realizing that he does not know who Lulu—or &quot;Nelly&quot;, &quot;Eva&quot;, or &quot;Mignon&quot;—is. When the Painter dies by suicide, Schön blames Lulu, calling her a &quot;murderess&quot;. In scene 3, Schön himself tries to manage Lulu by making her a dancer. A Prince plans to marry her and move to Africa. She persuades Schön to marry her instead (&quot;Sehr geehrtes Fräulein&quot;).

In Act 2, Schön is jealous of her cadre of admirers, including the lesbian Geschwitz. He experiences paranoid delusions and hallucinations. He tries to kill Lulu (&quot;Du Kreatur ...&quot;), but she kills him instead (Lied der Lulu: &quot;Wenn sich die Menschen&quot;). During the cinematic sequence (Filmmusik, the dramatic and musical midpoint of the opera), Lulu is tried, convicted, and imprisoned before Geschwitz helps her escape via the infirmary, having both contracted cholera together to this end. Though free (&quot;O Freiheit!&quot;) in scene 2, Lulu is a shadow of her former self. Alwa still idealizes her as his muse (Alwa&#x27;s hymn: &quot;Durch dieses Kleid&quot;). They flee the law to London, and her admirers follow.

In Act 3, some of them blackmail and threaten to sex traffick her, perhaps to Africa (Lied des Mächenhändlers, quoting Wedekind&#x27;s lute song; Lied der Lulu reprise). She arranges to have one murdered with Geschwitz&#x27;s help. The stock market crashes, ruining everyone (Verwandlungsmusik). In scene 2, Lulu is reduced to prostitution as perhaps before in her childhood. Seeking money, Schigolch finds only a book of homilies in the coat of Lulu&#x27;s first client, the Professor (the mirror, in a dual role, of her first husband Dr. Goll), who has discreetly paid Lulu in advance. Her second client, an African Prince (the Painter&#x27;s double), refuses to pay and beats Alwa dead. Geschwitz contemplates suicide. Lulu is so captivated by (or afraid of) her third client, Jack the Ripper (Schön&#x27;s double), that she waives payment. He murders Lulu and her &quot;crazy sister&quot; Geschwitz, who dies mourning Lulu (&quot;Lulu! Mein Engel!&quot;).

===Prologue===
&quot;The animal tamer appears from behind the curtain, whip in hand&quot;

A circus animal tamer welcomes the audience, &quot;Hereinspaziert in die Menagerie&quot; (Come on in to the menagerie) and describes the various animals in his menagerie, such as tigers, bears and monkeys. He lifts the curtain, and calls for the snake to be brought on. A stage hand carries out Lulu (&quot;Lulu motif&quot;) dressed as Pierrot, while the animal tamer describes her in biblical terms as the source of evil, fated to murder, &quot;Sie ward geschaffen, Unheil anzustiften ... Zu morden – ohne dass es einer spürt.&quot; (She was created, evil to instigate ... to murder – without leaving any clues), and orders her off, while inviting the audience to see what will unfold. He then retires behind the curtain, which rises on scene 1.

===Act 1===

&quot;Scene 1: A spacious but shabby artist&#x27;s studio. A podium, folding screen, easel with unfinished portrait of Lulu, divan with tiger skin, step ladder and sculpture. Lulu is standing on the podium, posing as Pierrot, holding a shepherd&#x27;s crook&quot;

The Painter is painting Lulu&#x27;s portrait. Dr. Schön is watching, and is joined by his son, Alwa. He excuses himself because he has to go to a rehearsal, and he and Schön leave. Alone with Lulu, the Painter makes passes at her. She rejects him initially, as he pursues her round the studio (&quot;canon, beginning with Lulu motif&quot;: &quot;Gnädige Frau ... Frau Medizinalrat – Wer hätte das gedacht!&quot;; Dearest Lady ... Frau Medizinalrat – Who would have imagined it!), during which the ladder falls and the statue breaks. At one stage, he calls her &quot;Eva&quot;. She explains that she is expecting her husband. Eventually she succumbs to his advances. The artist has locked the studio door, and when Dr. Goll arrives, there is consternation. Goll breaks the door down, and on finding Lulu and the artist together, dies of a stroke. At first they do not realise her husband is dead and call a doctor. Lulu is alone with her husband&#x27;s corpse (&quot;canzonetta: Auf einmal springt er auf&quot;; In a moment he will spring to life). When she accepts that he is dead, she reflects that she is now rich, to the artist&#x27;s horror, &quot;Jetzt bin ich reich – Es ist grauenerregend&quot; (Now I am rich – How revolting). They sing a duet in which he questions her beliefs, and the answer is always the same, &quot;Eine Frage: Kannst Du die Wahrheit sagen? – Ich weiss es nicht&quot; (A question: Can you tell the truth? – I don&#x27;t know). While Lulu is changing into her street clothes, the artist addresses her husband&#x27;s corpse (&quot;arioso&quot;: &quot;Ich möchte tauschen mit Dir, Du Toter! Ich geb&#x27; sie Dir zurück&quot;; I would trade places with you, dead man. I would give her back to you).

&quot;Interlude&quot;

&quot;Scene 2: An elegant drawing room in Lulu&#x27;s apartment, the studio beyond, her finished portrait on the wall. Lulu, on a chaise-longue is gazing into her hand mirror&quot;

The artist enters with the mail, again addressing her as Eve. In the mail he learns he has sold another painting of her, and mentions he has sold a number of paintings since they were married. She places one, a letter from Countess Corticelli, in her bosom. Another brings notice of Schön&#x27;s engagement, which seems to trouble her. They sing a love &quot;duettino&quot;, &quot;Ich finde, Du siehst heute reizend aus – Ich komme aus dem Bad&quot; (I find you so beautiful today – I have just come from my bath). She is visited by Schigolch, who remarks of the artist (&quot;chamber music&quot;, &quot;Den hab&#x27;ich mir auch ganz anders vorgestellt&quot;; I thought he would be different than he is). Schigolch is an asthmatic beggar who seems to have been featured in her past in an unspecified way, he asks for money which she gives him, and when he calls her &quot;Lulu&quot;, she says she has not been called that in a long time. As she is showing him out, Schön arrives (&quot;sonata movement&quot;) and recognises him, referring to him as Lulu&#x27;s father, which she does not deny. Schön asks Lulu to stay out of his life from now on, since he is engaged and it would be scandalous for them to see each other socially, but she says she belongs only to him (&quot;coda: love theme&quot;. &quot;Wenn ich einem Menschen auf dieser Welt angehöre, gehöre ich Ihnen&quot;; If I belong to any man in this world, I belong to you). Their discussion reveals that all the good fortune Lulu has experienced comes from Schön&#x27;s interventions, and that they have been meeting regularly. The exchange becomes increasingly agitated, until the return of the artist, who asks what has transpired. Lulu leaves in a huff, while Schön implies that he has had a longstanding affair with Lulu, since she was 12, and rescued her from the streets as a flower seller. The artist becomes increasingly distressed as he learns how little he knows about Lulu, not even her name, which appears to be different for every lover. Schön informs him about Schigolch being her father, and that after the death of his wife, Lulu appeared to be trying to take her place, so that he arranged to marry her off to Goll. Increasingly Schön urges the artist to confront Lulu, which he agrees to, leaving the room, but a terrible groan is heard offstage and Schön discovers the artist has locked the door. Lulu returns and they discuss what to do next, but are interrupted by the arrival of Alwa, who announces that revolution has broken out on the streets of Paris, which is causing consternation at the newspaper office. Lulu brings a hatchet, and they force open the door to find the artist dead. From a partly audible telephone conversation Schön has, which he implies is with the police, it is revealed that the artist cut his throat. Lulu, once again, is unmoved by the tragedy, while Schön and Alwa hope that the political news will sweep aside the scandal. When Schön calls her &quot;Ungeheuer!&quot; (Monster!), Lulu hints that she and Schön will be married after all (&quot;Lulu motif&quot;: &quot;Sie heiraten mich ja doch!&quot;; You will marry me after all). The curtain falls as the doorbell rings, which they believe is the police.

&quot;Interlude (Love theme)&quot;

&quot;Scene 3: In Lulu&#x27;s dressing room in the theatre, a folding screen upstage, a poster of Lulu&#x27;s portrait is seen&quot;

Lulu is changing behind the screen, Alwa is pouring champagne. The two discuss whether Schön will come that night, and a Prince who wants to take her to Africa. Alwa recalls his mother&#x27;s death, and how he had hoped that Lulu would replace her, while Lulu observes that his father put her on the stage in the hope that someone rich would marry her and take her off his hands. Lulu emerges in a ballet dress, Alwa appears smitten and they drink. At the sound of a bell, Lulu leaves to take the stage. Alwa watches her leave and then contemplates writing an opera based on her life, but as he draws out the scenes he concludes that they are too gruesome. Applause can be heard, and the Prince enters and reveals his wish to marry Lulu. It is apparent her sudden fame is due to favourable reviews published by Schön. Suddenly the bell starts ringing incessantly and an uproar is heard offstage. Alwa appears startled and Lulu enters suddenly, flinging herself in a chair, followed by the dresser and theatre manager, who explain that she fainted. She implies it was because she saw Schön with his fiancée, &quot;Mit seiner Braut!&quot; (With his bride!) whereupon Schön himself enters and Lulu refuses to continue because his fiancée is in the audience. All try to persuade Lulu to return to the stage, in a sextet &quot;Das hättest Du Dir besser erspart!&quot; (This you could have spared yourself!), then Schön dismisses the company leaving Lulu and himself alone. He admonishes her, &quot;Wie kannst Du die Szene gegen mich ausspielen?&quot; (how can you play this scene to get me?), they argue and she taunts him with the Prince and his inability to break off their relationship. It is apparent that he is torn between the two women, and she begins to exploit his weakness, compelling him to write a letter that she dictates, breaking off the engagement (Letter duet: &quot;Sehr geehrtes Fräulein …&quot;; Most respected Fräulein ...). Schön expresses feelings of impending doom, &quot;Jetzt – kommt – die Hinrichtung...&quot; (Now – comes – the execution) and Lulu, having achieved her purpose, prepares to return to the stage.

===Act 2===
&quot;Scene 1: In Lulu&#x27;s house, a magnificent German Renaissance style room with a gallery and staircase. A folding Chinese screen in front of the fireplace. Again, Lulu&#x27;s portrait can be seen, this time on an easel. Lulu is in an armchair in a morning gown, Countess Geschwitz on an ottoman, in masculine clothes, her face veiled. Dr. Schön is standing.&quot;

Countess Geschwitz, an admirer of Lulu, who is now married to Schön, is visiting her to invite her to a ball. She has brought flowers and, complimenting her on her portrait, wishes to paint her herself. Schön is clearly uncomfortable and Lulu shows Geschwitz out. Schön, left alone, appears disturbed and jealous and speaks of madness, producing a revolver, &quot;Der Irrsinn hat sich meiner Vernunft schon bemächtigt&quot; (Madness has conquered my reason already). On her return Lulu tries to convince Schön to take the afternoon off and go for a drive with her (&quot;cavatina&quot;: &quot;Könntest Du Dich für heute Nachmittag nicht freimachen?&quot;; Can&#x27;t you make this afternoon free?), but he points out that he is due at the stock exchange. Lulu starts to lavish affection on Schön, and they go into the bedroom, whereupon Geschwitz reenters the house and hides behind the screen. Schigolch and two other admirers, the athlete, who is carrying the struggling schoolboy (played by a woman, &quot;i.e.&quot; a travesti role), all enter. Schigolch says that he also lives in the house and that they have paid him to leave them with Lulu, who then reappears. She is dressed for the ball, décolleté with orchids between her breasts. She leans in to the schoolboy, urging him to smell the flowers. As she leaves they begin to discuss the Prince, who has gone abroad (&quot;canon&quot;: &quot;Er hat sie nämlich ursprünglich heiraten wollen&quot;; She was the one he originally wanted to marry) and Schigolch says that he too wishes to marry Lulu, &quot;Wer hat sie nicht ursprünglich heiraten wollen!&quot; (Who has not always wanted to marry her!), a sentiment with which they all agree, as he explains that Lulu is not his daughter.

When Lulu returns, she also agrees that she never had a father. They discuss Schön, who has left for the exchange, and what Lulu calls his &quot;Verfolgungswahn&quot; (paranoia), but a servant announces his return and the athlete and schoolboy also hide while Schigolch starts to leave. However, it is Alwa who enters, not his father, and she orders refreshments as they sit and start to talk and flirt. Schön enters unnoticed, sees his son, and he too hides. Their conversation becomes more intense and Alwa declares his love for Lulu, &quot;Liebst Du mich Mignon?&quot; (Do you love me, Mignon?), burying his head in her lap. At this point, Lulu confesses to Alwa that she poisoned his mother. Meanwhile, unnoticed by the couple, Schön sees the athlete and draws his revolver, but the athlete indicates it is Alwa he should kill, and hides again. Lulu notices them and announces his presence.

Schön reveals himself, once again announcing revolution in Paris, newspaper in hand, and drags Alwa away. The athlete briefly reappears, pursued by Schön, revolver in hand. Schön, believing the athlete escaped, begins to harangue Lulu (&quot;aria in five strophes&quot;: &quot;Du Kreatur, die mich durch den Strassenkot zum Martertode schleift!&quot;; You wretch, that drags me through the faeces in the streets to martyrdom!), handing the revolver to Lulu, who appears unperturbed, and implying she should kill herself before he kills Alwa. She points the revolver at him, but instead she fires at the ceiling. Increasingly agitated, Schön seizes the revolver and begins to search the house for Lulu&#x27;s lovers, but finds only Geschwitz, whom he locks in another room. Again he gives Lulu the gun, implying her suicide will save his reputation from being considered a cuckold, &quot;meine Stirn zu verzieren&quot; (my head to decorate) – i.e. with horns. Lulu sings the &quot;Lied der Lulu&quot; (&quot;Wenn sich die Menschen um meinetwillen umgebracht haben&quot;; When men have killed for my sake) in which she asks for a divorce, saying she can only be &quot;als was ich bin&quot; (what I am). Schön only replies that he will murder her and make it look like suicide, forcing her to her knees and pointing the gun at her while holding it in her hand (&quot;5th strophe&quot;: &quot;Nieder, Mörderin! In die Knie!&quot;; Get down, murderess, on your knees!). While Schön is momentarily distracted by the schoolboy&#x27;s sudden appearance, Lulu empties the remaining five rounds into him. But he is still alive, and realises he has yet another &#x27;rival&#x27;, &quot;Und – da – ist – noch – einer!&quot; (And – there – is – another!). He calls for his son, who reappears, while Lulu appears remorseful, and then he dies. Lulu goes to leave but Alwa bars her way. She begs him not to give her up (&quot;arietta&quot;: &quot;Du kannst mich nicht dem Gericht ausliefern!&quot;; You cannot deliver me up to the Law!), which he refuses to do despite her offers to be his for the rest of her life, &quot;Ich will Dir treu sein mein Leben lang&quot; (I will be faithful to you my whole life long). Once again, a doorbell announces the arrival of the police.

&quot;Interlude in the form of a silent film. Both film and the musical accompaniment are in the form of a palindrome. The film depicts four main events, pivoting on Lulu&#x27;s one year in prison, and four following her imprisonment, forming the palindrome. The first sequence shows the arrest, detention, trial and the prison door closing. The second sequence shows the reverse with the prison door opening, the medical assessment, the isolation ward in hospital, and her escape. In each mirror event the number of people involved is the same, for example three people arrest her and three liberate her. As the palindrome progresses, Lulu loses hope in detention, is tried and transferred to prison, where she becomes resigned to her fate. There hope returns as she contracts cholera and after a further &quot;trial&quot; by doctors is transferred to hospital where hope grows as Geschwitz visits her, they change clothes, and Lulu escapes disguised as the other woman. During the palindrome many details and symbols, before and after prison, match each other, including Lulu&#x27;s portrait, a recurring visual motif throughout the opera.&quot;

&quot;Scene 2: The same place as scene 1, one year later, an air of neglect, daylight has been shut out. The portrait is now leaning against the fireplace, facing away from the audience,&quot;

Geschwitz, Alwa and the athlete are anxiously awaiting Schigolch and discussing the escape plan. The athlete is dressed as Alwa&#x27;s footman and is planning to marry Lulu and take her to Paris as an acrobat. Geschwitz appears frail and will take Lulu&#x27;s place in hospital. She is funding the escape, but refuses Alwa&#x27;s offer of financial help. She is going to sacrifice her own freedom by taking Lulu&#x27;s place so that nobody will discover she has escaped until it is too late. When Schigolch arrives, he and Geschwitz depart for the hospital, while the other two men discuss their plans. Alwa has sold the newspaper and written a melodrama for Lulu to star in. They begin to argue over money but are interrupted by the schoolboy (&quot;chamber music II&quot;, &quot;Mit wem habe ich&quot;; With whom have I), who has just broken out of prison and devised a scheme to free Lulu. Alwa and the athlete lie to him that Lulu is dead, showing him a newspaper article about her illness, then throw him out. Schigolch arrives with Lulu (&quot;melodrama&quot;: &quot;Hü, kleine Lulu: – wir müssen heut&#x27; noch über die Grenze&quot;; Well, little Lulu: we must cross the border today), looking very pale and weak from her illness. The athlete is disgusted at seeing her in this state, abandons his plan and goes off saying that he will summon the police instead. Schigolch goes to buy train tickets. As soon as he has gone, Lulu, who has been acting the part of the invalid, makes an instant recovery. Now alone with Alwa, she explains the plot in detail. Geschwitz went to Hamburg to nurse cholera patients and deliberately infected both herself and Lulu with contaminated clothing so that they were both placed in an isolation ward together. After Geschwitz was discharged, she returned to visit Lulu and they changed places (&quot;melodrama&quot;: &quot;Jetzt liegt sie dort drüben als die Mörderin des Doktor Schön&quot;; Now she lies there as the murderer of Dr. Schön), while Lulu feigned illness to get rid of the athlete. Now alone with Alwa, the portrait is returned to the easel and Lulu seduces the willing Alwa once again. They declare their love for each other in a second love duet, &quot;uns sehen, so oft wir wollen&quot; (to see each other as often as we want) reaching its climax with Alwa&#x27;s hymn to Lulu (&quot;hymne&quot;: &quot;Durch dieses Kleid empfinde ich Deinen Wuchs wie Musik&quot;; Through this dress I feel your body like music), and make plans to go away together. At the end of the duet and scene she asks him, &quot;Ist das noch der Diwan, – auf dem sich – dein Vater – verblutet hat?&quot; (Isn&#x27;t this the sofa on which your father bled to death?).

===Act 3===
&quot;Scene 1: A spacious drawing room in Lulu&#x27;s luxurious house in Paris. Lulu&#x27;s portrait hangs on the wall. The guests are assembled&quot;

Lulu is living in Paris under the alias of a French countess. A grand birthday party is taking place at her house and the athlete who is planning to get married proposes a toast to her. The Marquis shows an unusual interest in the 15-year-old girl. The guests move to the gaming room to play baccarat. The conversation moves to discussing shares in the Jungfrau Railway, which most of the guests at the party have invested in to varying extents, and which appear to be performing magnificently.

The Marquis has discovered Lulu&#x27;s true identity, and is blackmailing her (&quot;duet&quot;:&quot;Sag es nur gleich heraus, wieviel du haben willst&quot;; Tell me without delay, how much money you want), threatening to hand her over to the authorities. She offers herself to him, having had a previous affair, but his interests lie more in trafficking women and girls for commercial sexual exploitation, &quot;Lied des Mächenhändlers&quot;: &quot;Ich sagte dir doch, daß ich auch Mächenhändler bin&quot; (song of the human tafficker: I told you I am a white slave trader). Again, Lulu sings about who she is and what she has become, as in her act II Lied; &quot;Ich tauge nicht für diesen Beruf. Als ich fünfzehn Jahre alt war, hätte mir das gefallen können&quot; (I&#x27;m no good for this sort of work, when I was fifteen it was different, I might have enjoyed it). The Marquis indicates he could summon the policeman stationed out in the street and claim the reward for her capture, but he would get a far higher price by selling her to a Cairo brothel to which he has sent a picture of her portrait as Eve. She offers to pay him, but he is aware that Alwa&#x27;s fortune is all in the railway shares, and he wants cash, giving her a deadline later that day. She reads a note the athlete handed her just before the Marquis confronted her and learns that he too wants to blackmail her. Geschwitz accuses her of not returning the favours and affection she showed Lulu when they were in hospital. The athlete returns and makes apparent that he is still interested in Lulu&#x27;s affections and also gives her a deadline, &quot;duet&quot;: &quot;Einen Moment! Hast du meinen Brief gelesen?&quot; (One Moment! Have you read my note?). A telegram arrives for the Banker informing him the railway shares are now worthless. When Schigolch arrives, asking for money for his girlfriend (&quot;duet&quot;: &quot;Ich brauche nämlich notwendig Geld...Ich miete meiner Geliebten eine Wohnung&quot;; I need some money now, I am renting an apartment for my lover), Lulu collapses in despair but confides in him.

Schigolch too has designs upon Lulu, but she persuades him that if he can arrange for the athlete&#x27;s death she will give him the money, which he says he will do if she can persuade the athlete to come to his home, which she promises. The Marquis suspects the athlete, but he denies it. Lulu then convinces the athlete that if he spends the night with Geschwitz, she will pay Lulu, who can then pay him the blackmail money. She then persuades the countess that she will give herself to her if she spends the night with the athlete. Although puzzled, Geschwitz agrees to the bargain. Having achieved this, Lulu turns to her valet and orders him to change clothes with her. The news of the railway collapse spreads through the company to general despair. Lulu, dressed as her valet, informs Alwa they have been discovered and the police are on their way, and they escape. Again the scene ends with the arrival of the police, who confront the valet before realising their mistake.

&quot;Scene 2: A windowless garret in London, with a leaking skylight. A bucket collects water dripping from the skylight. On the floor a torn mattress. A door leads to Lulu&#x27;s bedroom&quot;

Alwa and Schigolch are discussing their predicament. They and Lulu are now living in poverty and on the run. It is Lulu&#x27;s first day of work as a &quot;Freudenmädchen&quot; (sex worker), from which they intend to make a living, although Alwa is ambivalent. When they hear Lulu approaching with her first client, a professor, they hide. The professor remains silent throughout, is very gentle and pays her generously. Lulu is thrilled. Geschwitz, now shabbily dressed, then arrives with the portrait of Lulu, which she has removed from the frame and brought from Paris. Lulu is disturbed at seeing it, but Alwa is inspired and hangs it on the wall, believing it will please the clients, and they discuss the fate of the artist, &quot;quartet&quot;: &quot;Ihr Körper stand auf dem Höhepunkt&quot; (Her body, then, was at it highest peak). Lulu goes out to prove her attractiveness, leaving with Geschwitz. Alwa reveals that Lulu had contracted venereal disease from the Marquis and in turn passed it on to him.

Lulu returns with her second client, the Negro, &quot;Komm nur herein, mein Schatz! Komm!&quot; (Come in, my love! Come in!), who becomes angry at being asked to pay in advance and attacks her. Alwa rushes to her defence but is killed by the Negro, who then leaves, followed by Lulu in despair while Schigolch removes the body. Geschwitz returns, saying Lulu sent her away, while Schigolch leaves. She produces a gun and considers killing herself, bitterly believing that Lulu would shed &quot;mir keine Träne nach&quot; (not one tear for me), then changes her mind and goes to hang herself, pausing first in reverence before Lulu&#x27;s portrait. She is interrupted by the entrance of Lulu and her third client, Jack the Ripper. When asked, she says Geschwitz is her crazy sister. Jack makes to leave, saying he has little money and she is asking too much. She pleads with him and they haggle over the price, while she reveals it is her first day on the job, as he suspected. He also guesses the true nature of Geschwitz&#x27;s feelings for Lulu. Lulu says she is drawn to Jack and eventually offers to give herself to him without payment. They go into the bedroom. Geschwitz, left to herself, resolves to return to Germany to become a lawyer and work for women&#x27;s rights. On hearing Lulu&#x27;s screams, she rushes to the bedroom door but Jack emerges with a blood-stained knife that he plunges into her body, and she collapses. Jack calmly washes his hands in the basin, not believing his luck at having killed two women at once, &quot;Ich bin doch ein verdammter Glückspilz&quot;! (I am just the luckiest of men!), complains about the lack of a towel and leaves. In her dying breath Geschwitz declares her eternal love for Lulu, &quot;Lulu! Mein Engel! Laß dich noch einmal sehn! Ich bin dir nah! Bleibe dir nah! In Ewigkeit!&quot; (Lulu! My Angel! Let me see you one more time! I am close! Stay close! For eternity!).

== Analysis ==

=== Dramatic ===
The character of Lulu has been described as embodying both elements of female sexuality&#x27;s dualism, earth-mother and whore. In the words of Karl Kraus, she is the woman &quot;who became the destroyer of all because everyone destroyed her&quot;. Berg&#x27;s involvement with the lower depths of society in his two dramatic works, &quot;Wozzeck&quot; and &quot;Lulu&quot;, surprised even Schoenberg. Like &quot;Wozzeck&quot;, &quot;Lulu&quot; is social criticism, a tragedy in which the protagonists are portrayed as victims, gradually becoming enslaved to social forces they are too weak to deal with. Significantly, Lulu is canonically startlingly young, only about 15 years of age when the drama begins, and Schigolch, who may or may not be her father, is implied to have been her first sexual experience. Palindromes in the piece take many forms, such as the rise and fall of Lulu and the recycling of the actors: the three men whose deaths she contributes to become Lulu&#x27;s three clients, and the man she murdered murders her. Alwa, thought to be the antithesis of Lulu, was changed from Wedekind&#x27;s dramatist to Berg&#x27;s composer and is assumed to be a stand-in for Berg himself. In all cases, the music underscores and confirms Berg&#x27;s dramatic allusions.

&quot;Lulu&quot; is arguably the first seminal work of western art music that used the vibraphone, an instrument that had previously been associated with jazz. However, it has been used in smaller works by major composers prior to &quot;Lulu&quot;, such as Maurice Ravel&#x27;s orchestrations of &quot;Don Quichotte à Dulcinée&quot; and &quot;Ronsard à son âme [fr]&quot; (1933 and 1935 respectively), as well as Darius Milhaud&#x27;s incidental music to &quot;L&#x27;annonce faite à Marie&quot; (1932).

====Structure====

Berg was obsessed with symmetry in his works and &quot;Lulu&quot; is no exception, the whole being perceived as a palindrome or mirror. Lulu&#x27;s popularity in the first act is mirrored by the squalor she lives in during act 3, and this is emphasised by Lulu&#x27;s husbands in act 1 being played by the same singers as her clients in act 3. The motifs associated with each are repeated.

This mirrorlike structure is further emphasised by the film interlude at act 2 at the very centre of the work. The events shown in the film are a miniature version of the mirror structure of the opera as a whole (Lulu enters prison and then leaves again) and the music accompanying the film is an exact palindrome – it reads the same forwards as backwards. The centre of this palindrome is indicated by an arpeggio played on the piano, first rising, then falling (shown here on the top staff).

Berg assigns specific vocal styles to each character with descriptive orchestral representation, recapitulative episodes to emphasise psychological significance and pitch-sets. Recapitulation includes having single singers performing multiple roles. The use of pitch includes the use of twelve-tone rows.

====Serialism====
Cell z (also one of the basic cells in Bartók&#x27;s String Quartet No. 4) is the basic cell of &quot;Lulu&quot; and generates trope I:

Although some of &quot;Lulu&quot; is freely composed, Berg also makes use of Schoenberg&#x27;s twelve-tone technique. Rather than using one tone row for the entire work, however, he gives each character his or her own tone row, meaning that the tone rows act rather like the leitmotifs in Richard Wagner&#x27;s operas.

From this one tone row, Berg derives tone rows for many of the characters. For example, the tone row associated with Lulu herself is: F, G, A, B, C, D, F, D, E, A, B, C. This row is constructed by extracting one note (F) from the basic row&#x27;s first trichord, then taking the next note (G) from the basic row&#x27;s second trichord, then taking the third note (A) from the basic row&#x27;s third trichord, and so on, cycling through the basic row three times.

The tone row associated with Alwa is arrived at by repeating the basic tone row over and over and taking every seventh note;

this results in the following tone row: B, F, E, G, F, B, E, D, A, C, C, G

Similarly, the tone row associated with Dr. Schön is arrived at by repeating the basic tone row (as in the previous example) and taking the first note, missing one note, taking the next, missing two, taking the next, missing three, taking the next, missing three, taking the next, missing two, taking the next, missing one, taking the next, missing one, taking the next, missing two, taking the next, and so on; this results in the following tone row: B, E, G, G, D, F, E, A, B, C, F, C

== Posthumous history ==
The opera was first performed by the Zürich Opera in an incomplete form on June 2, 1937. Erwin Stein made a vocal score of the whole of act 3 following Berg&#x27;s death, and Helene Berg, Alban&#x27;s widow, approached Schoenberg to complete the orchestration. Schoenberg at first accepted, but upon being sent copies of Berg&#x27;s sketches he changed his mind, saying that it would be a more time-consuming task than he had thought. Helene subsequently forbade anybody else to complete the opera, and for over 40 years only the first two acts could be given complete, usually with the act 3 portions of the &quot;Lulu Suite&quot; played in place of act 3. The last recording made of the original two-act version—Christoph von Dohnányi conducting the Vienna Philharmonic, with Anja Silja in the title role (Decca/London, recorded 1976 and released 1978)—presented it in this form.

Director Heinz Ruckert shot the silent film featured at the midpoint according to Berg&#x27;s exacting specifications. The film wordlessly depicts Lulu&#x27;s arrest, trial, incarceration, and ultimate liberation thanks to the cunning of the Countess Geschwitz. Like the music for this sequence (and the opera as a whole), the film has a palindromic structure. The original film is lost save for four stills which remain in the Zürich Stadtarchiv. Each successive production requires a new film to be shot with the stage actors, though many recent productions have omitted the film altogether.

==Performance history==
After the Zürich premiere, the opera was seen at La Fenice on 4 September 1949 during the Venice Biennale, conducted by Sanzogno. The German premiere was at the Grillo-Theater in Essen on 7 March 1953 with Carla Spletter in the title role, and the Netherlands premiere on July 7 of that year at the Stadsschouwburg in Amsterdam as part of the Holland Festival, both with conducted by Gustav König and broadcast to the UK on the BBC on 10 August. This was followed by a production at Hamburg in 1957 with Helga Pilarczyk in a Günther Rennert production, conducted by Leopold Ludwig which was also seen at the Paris Opera in 1960 and La Scala in 1963, and Sadler&#x27;s Wells 1962.

In its two-act form plus sketches of the third act, &quot;Lulu&quot; made its American debut at the Santa Fe Opera in New Mexico during the 1963 season, with the American soprano Joan Carroll in the title role, together with Donald Gramm (Schön), Elaine Bonazzi (Geschwitz), and George Shirley (Alwa), with Robert Craft conducting. The Opera&#x27;s general director, John Crosby, attempted to negotiate for Santa Fe to stage the American premiere of the full three-act opera, but was not successful. A notable Lulu, Silja, made her debut in a Wieland Wagner production at the Staatsoper Stuttgart in 1966 (which was later filmed, with Carlos Alexander as Schön). In 1967 the Metropolitan Opera presented the Hamburg State Opera production with Ludwig conducting, Toni Blankenheim (Schön), Anneliese Rothenberger (Lulu), Kerstin Meyer (Geschwitz), Gerhard Unger (Alwa), Kim Borg (Schigolch) and Maria von Ilosvay (Theatre dresser). This production was recorded by Electrola the following year. Celebrated Lulus have included Evelyn Lear, Teresa Stratas, Nancy Shade, Karan Armstrong, Julia Migenes, Barbara Hannigan, Christine Schäfer, and Marlis Petersen.

Helene Berg&#x27;s death in 1976 paved the way for a new completed version of the opera to be made by Friedrich Cerha. There was insufficient time to have the score of this three-act version ready for the first production of the work at the Metropolitan Opera in April 1977 (in a production by John Dexter, with Carole Farley in the title role), so the incomplete version was used. Published in 1979, the Cerha completion premiered on 24 February the same year at the Opera Garnier and was conducted by Pierre Boulez, with Stratas singing the lead role; the production (by Patrice Chéreau) was a sensation and the recording won the Gramophone Award for 1979.

The U.S. premiere of the complete opera was on 28 July 1979 at Santa Fe, with Nancy Shade (Lulu), William Dooley (Schön), Katherine Ciesinski (Geschwitz) and Barry Busse (Alwa). The Metropolitan Opera first presented it in December 1980, a performance later released on DVD. Its 2015 production, with Marlis Petersen in the title role, was broadcast in high definition on 21 November. That production featured projections and animated drawings by William Kentridge. The same production, with a different cast, also played at De Nationale Opera, Amsterdam (2015), the English National Opera, London in 2016, and the Teatro dell&#x27;Opera di Roma (2017).

<text>&quot;I Shot an Arrow into the Air&quot; is the fifteenth episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
A crewed space flight with eight astronauts crash lands on what they believe to be an unknown asteroid, with an area of desert and jagged mountains. Only four of the crew survive the crash: the commanding officer Donlin, crewmen Corey and Pierson, and a crewman named Hudak who is badly injured and barely alive, and the chances of rescue or survival are bleak. After they bury the dead men, Donlin and Pierson concern themselves with taking care of Hudak, but Corey, who is only concerned with saving himself, declares that sharing their limited supply of water with Hudak will reduce the chances of survival for the rest of them. This sets Corey at odds with both Pierson and Donlin, who insist that they will care for Hudak and share their water with him for as long as he does survive. Hudak dies a short time later; after they bury him, Donlin has Corey and Pierson trek out into the barren desert to see if there is anything that might improve their chances of survival.

Six hours later, Corey returns alone, claiming not to know where Pierson went. Donlin calls Corey out on having more water in his canteen now than he had when he left, and demands to know where Pierson is. Corey claims that he found Pierson dead and took his water. Not believing this account, Donlin wants to see for himself and forces Corey at gunpoint to lead him to Pierson&#x27;s body. When they reach the spot Corey claims to have found Pierson, the body is not there, nor is there any evidence that backs Corey&#x27;s claim, leaving Donlin more dubious. They later find Pierson near the edge of a mountain, alive but severely wounded. Donlin drops the gun and rushes to Pierson, who wordlessly gestures that he climbed the mountain and saw something. With his last bit of strength, Pierson draws a primitive diagram in the sand with his finger (two parallel lines intersected by a perpendicular line), and then dies. Meanwhile, Corey grabs the dropped gun, and confesses that he attacked Pierson earlier. He then shoots and kills Donlin and sets out alone, confident that he will survive longer now that he has all of the water for himself.

Corey climbs a mountain and sees a sign for Reno, along with telephone poles, which was what Pierson had attempted to draw before he died. Realizing that they had in fact never left Earth and that he had killed his partners for nothing, Corey breaks down weeping and begging his deceased crewmates for forgiveness.

==Closing narration==
==Episode notes==
* Despite this, Serling did end up producing an idea from an industry outsider when he paid Madelon Champion $500 () for the idea on which this episode was based, an idea that came up in a social conversation between the two. Though Serling was frequently approached with suggestions for the series, such a purchase was never repeated.
*Much of this episode was filmed in Death Valley National Monument (now a National Park), particularly around Zabriskie Point.
*In addition to the usual opening and closing narration, this episode features a rare bit of narration from Serling in the middle of the show—after Corey kills Donlin, Serling narrates Corey&#x27;s travels through the desert landscape. This was the last use of mid-show narration until season 3&#x27;s &quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot;.
*The title of the episode comes from the opening line of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;The Arrow and the Song&quot;: &quot;I shot an arrow into the air, it fell to Earth I knew not where.&quot; Serling also used this title for a prospective &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; pilot episode that was eventually shot, in modified form, as &quot;The Gift&quot;.
*The plot idea of astronauts thinking they had crashed on an unknown planet, only to discover that in fact they had been on Earth all along, would be adapted by Rod Serling in his work on the initial screenplay of the 1968 film &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;.
*This is one of several episodes from season one to have its opening title sequence replaced with the opening for season two. This was done during the summer of 1961 in order to match the re-running episodes of season one to episodes of the second season.

<text>&quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot; is the sixteenth episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; which originally aired on January 22, 1960, on CBS. It is based on Lucille Fletcher&#x27;s radio play &quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot;. It is frequently listed among the series&#x27; greatest episodes.

==Opening narration==
The narration continues after the dialogue between Nan and the mechanic.

==Plot==

Nan Adams, on a cross-country road trip from New York City to Los Angeles, gets a flat tire on U.S. Route 11 in Pennsylvania and survives losing control of the car and skidding onto the shoulder. The mechanic she has called to come put a spare tire on comments that he is surprised she survived, saying &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t have called for a mechanic. Somebody should&#x27;ve called for a hearse.&quot; He directs her to follow him into town where he will supply her with a new tire. As she is driving from the site of her blow-out, Nan notices a shabby and strange-looking man hitchhiking. Later, as she is preparing to leave the service station in town, she again sees this hitchhiker, but the mechanic does not see him when she mentions it. Unnerved, she drives away. As she continues her trip, Nan sees the same hitchhiker thumbing for a ride again in Virginia and at several other points in her journey.

She grows increasingly frightened of him. When she stops at a railroad crossing for an oncoming train, the man is situated on the other side of the tracks. She decides to drive ahead but the car stalls on the tracks. She manages to restart the vehicle and back up just as the train speeds past.

Nan is now convinced that the hitchhiker is trying to kill her. She continues to drive, becoming more and more afraid, stopping only when necessary. Every time she stops, however, the hitchhiker is there, always ahead of her.

She takes a side road in New Mexico but gets stranded when she runs out of gas. She reaches a gas station on foot but it is closed; although she rouses the proprietor from bed, he refuses to reopen and sell her gas due to the late hour. Nan is startled by a sailor on his way back to San Diego from leave. Eager for protection from the hitchhiker, she offers to drive the sailor all the way to his destination. He gladly accepts and persuades the station attendant to provide gas. As they drive together and discuss their mutual predicaments, she sees the hitchhiker on the road and swerves toward him. The sailor, who cannot see him, questions her driving; she admits she was trying to run over the hitchhiker. The sailor begins to fear for his safety and leaves her, despite her efforts to have him stay, even going so far as offering to go out with him.

In Arizona, Nan stops to call her mother in Manhattan, New York City. The woman who answers the phone says Mrs. Adams is in the hospital, having suffered a nervous breakdown after finding out that her daughter, Nan, died in Pennsylvania six days ago when the car she was driving blew a tire and overturned. Nan realizes the truth: she didn&#x27;t survive the accident in Pennsylvania and the hitchhiker is none other than the personification of death, patiently and persistently waiting for her to realize that she has been dead all along. She loses all emotion, concern, and feels empty.

Nan returns to the car and looks in the vanity mirror on the visor. Instead of her reflection, she sees the hitchhiker, who says, &quot;I believe you&#x27;re going...&quot;my&quot; way?&quot;

==Closing narration==
==Episode notes==

In the original radio play by Lucille Fletcher, the character of Nan was a man named Ronald Adams. &quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot; was first presented on &quot;The Orson Welles Show&quot; (1941), &quot;Philip Morris Playhouse&quot; (1942), &quot;Suspense&quot; (1942), and &quot;The Mercury Summer Theater&quot; (1946). All of these radio productions were live performances starring Orson Welles as Ronald Adams.

When the teleplay was adapted for radio on &quot;The Twilight Zone Radio Dramas&quot; in 2002, the role of Nan Adams was played by Kate Jackson.

<doc id="113326" wikidata="Q3364302" url="?curid=113326" title="Billy Bass Nelson">
<text>William &quot;Billy Bass&quot; Nelson (born January 28, 1951) is an American musician, who was the original bassist for Funkadelic. He is a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, inducted in 1997 with fifteen other members of Parliament-Funkadelic.

== Career ==
Nelson was born in Plainfield, New Jersey and as a teenager worked at George Clinton&#x27;s barbershop, sweeping the floor and singing and dancing for the customers. Clinton was a member of the doo wop vocal group the Parliaments, who scored a nationwide hit in 1967 with the song &quot;(I Wanna) Testify&quot;. Clinton put together a backing band as musical support for a tour and recruited Nelson, who in turn recommended his friend Eddie Hazel. Nelson and Hazel eventually took on bass and lead guitar roles respectively. The backing band was originally unnamed, but Nelson later coined the name &quot;Funkadelic&quot; to reflect the style (funk) and connect it with the then-burgeoning psychedelic music scene.

By 1970, Funkadelic was a full band consisting of Nelson, Hazel, drummer Tiki Fulwood, guitarist Tawl Ross, and keyboardist Mickey Atkins (later replaced by Bernie Worrell). Since 1967 the band had been billed as the musical backing for The Parliaments. Due to legal problems, in the early 1970s Clinton had temporarily lost the rights to the name &quot;The Parliaments&quot; and instead signed the entire ensemble to Westbound Records under the name Funkadelic. Nelson was a prominent contributor to the first three Funkadelic albums, &quot;Funkadelic&quot; (1970), &quot;Free Your Mind... and Your Ass Will Follow&quot; (1970), and &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; (1971).

Nelson left the group in late 1971 after a financial dispute with George Clinton (making Nelson the first Parliament-Funkadelic member to defect over such concerns, foreshadowing a major problem that would haunt Clinton in the late 1970s). Nelson and Hazel next performed with The Temptations. Nelson rejoined Funkadelic briefly in the studio in 1975, playing on the track &quot;Better By the Pound&quot; on the Funkadelic album &quot;Let&#x27;s Take It To The Stage&quot;. Nelson later played with The Commodores, Chairmen of the Board, Fishbone, Jermaine Jackson, Parlet, Lionel Richie, Smokey Robinson, and Lenny Williams.

In the 1990s, Nelson enjoyed a surge of name-checking by such legendary bassists as John Norwood Fisher (of Fishbone) and Flea (of the Red Hot Chili Peppers), while his early Funkadelic work was being sampled often by hip hop artists. Joining with some other P-Funk alumni, in 1994 Nelson released the album &quot;Out of the Dark&quot; under the name O.G. Funk. Since 1994 he has served in various touring lineups of Parliament-Funkadelic. He has also toured with P-Funk spinoff acts the 420 Funk Mob and Sons of Funk.

<text>&quot;The Fever&quot; is the seventeenth episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It originally aired on January 29, 1960, on CBS. The complete, original text for this story was run in the debut issue of Harvey Kurtzman’s &quot;Help!&quot;, cover dated August, 1960.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Franklin Gibbs and his wife Flora go to Las Vegas because she won a slogan contest. He detests gambling, but his wife is excited about their vacation. In a casino, she puts a nickel in a slot machine and Franklin admonishes her for wasting money. She convinces him to let her pull the arm since she already put the money in, but wins nothing on the spin. Happy that his point was made, he implores her to go back to their room so they can get ready for dinner. As they walk, Franklin is given a silver dollar by a drunk man who makes him use it in a different machine that advertises a $10,000 jackpot. He wins a few dollars and tells Flora that they should keep the winnings and not lose it back like other people. As they depart, Franklin believes he hears the slot machine calling his name in a monstrous-sounding voice.

Franklin continues to hear the voice as he tries to sleep. He gets out of bed, telling his wife he cannot keep &quot;tainted&quot; money, and that he is going to get rid of it by putting it back in the machine. Later, Flora goes to the casino and finds Franklin playing the machine obsessively. When Flora tries to coax him to stop, he declares that he has lost so much that he has to try to win some of it back. He becomes enraged when she presses him to leave; he declares that the machine is &quot;inhuman,&quot; that it &quot;teases you, [...] sucks you in.&quot; The casino workers watch and talk about him as he constantly plays and ignores his wife&#x27;s pleas to go to bed. When Franklin puts his last dollar into the machine, it suddenly malfunctions and the reels will not spin. He loses his temper, knocks the machine over, and is taken screaming out of the casino.

Later in bed, Franklin tells Flora that it was about to pay off, but deliberately broke down so that it would not have to give him his money. He again hears the machine calling his name, then sees it coming down the hallway toward the couple&#x27;s room and pursuing him. To his horror, its coin hopper is now covered by a hood etched with a large smile. Flora can neither see nor hear the machine as it backs Franklin up toward the window, until he crashes backwards through it and falls to his death. The police stand over his body, noting that his wife had stated that he had not slept in 24 hours, and a casino manager comments that he has never seen anyone develop a gambling addiction so quickly and severely. Franklin&#x27;s last dollar rolls across the pavement to stop by his outstretched hand, and the camera pans in the direction from which it came and stops on the &quot;smiling&quot; machine.

== Episode notes ==
In &quot;Serling: The Rise and Twilight of Television&#x27;s Last Angry Man&quot;, Gordon F. Sander wrote, &quot;Serling celebrated the signing of his new show, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; by spending a weekend in Las Vegas. While Carol Serling was having good luck nearby, he became enslaved by a merciless one-armed bandit, an incident he would turn into one of his first &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episodes.&quot;

The slot machine was reused in the later episodes &quot;A Nice Place to Visit&quot; and &quot;The Prime Mover&quot;.

This is one of several episodes from Season One with its opening title sequence plastered over with the opening for Season Two. This was done during the Summer of 1961 to help the Season One shows fit in with the new look the show had taken during the following season. This is also one of three Season One episodes with Marius Constant&#x27;s theme instead of Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s over the closing credits.

<text>Sandra Marie Schmirler (June 11, 1963 – March 2, 2000) was a Canadian curler who captured three Canadian Curling Championships (Scott Tournament of Hearts) and three World Curling Championships. Schmirler also skipped (captained) her Canadian team to a gold medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics, the first year women&#x27;s curling was a medal sport. At tournaments where she was not competing, Schmirler sometimes worked as a commentator for CBC Sports, which popularized her nickname &quot;Schmirler the Curler&quot; and claimed she was the only person who had a name that rhymed with the sport she played. She died in 2000 at 36 of cancer, leaving a legacy that extended outside of curling. Schmirler was honoured posthumously with an induction into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame and was awarded the World Curling Freytag Award, which later led to her induction into the World Curling Federation Hall of Fame.

In 2019, Schmirler was named the second greatest Canadian female curler in history (after Jennifer Jones) in a TSN poll of broadcasters, reporters and top curlers. Schmirler&#x27;s Olympic team, which also included Jan Betker, Joan McCusker and Marcia Gudereit, was named the greatest female Canadian curling team of all time as part of the same poll.

==Curling career==
While attending Biggar Composite School in Biggar, Saskatchewan, Canada, Schmirler started curling in Grade 7 as part of the school&#x27;s physical education program. She grew up an athlete, playing volleyball, badminton, and softball. She was also an avid speed swimmer. She continued to curl on the local scene, participating in the Biggar Curling Club ladies&#x27; league in Grade 9. Playing as third on her high school team, she won a provincial championship in Grade 12, when her team went undefeated throughout the season.

She continued to curl after graduating from high school, while attending the University of Saskatchewan, making her first appearance in Saskatchewan&#x27;s provincial playdowns in 1983. Schmirler threw fourth stones for a team which consisted of 1979 Canadian Junior Champions Denise Wilson (skip), Dianne Choquette and Shannon Olafson. The team represented the University of Saskatchewan at the Saskatoon city playdowns where they were eliminated. After graduating university, Schmirler moved to Regina to take a job at the North West Leisure Centre. She continued to curl, and was given the nickname &quot;Schmirler the Curler&quot; by a supervisor at the facility. Schmirler joined the Saskatoon-based Carol Davis rink, playing third for the team. In their first season together, they made it to the 1984 provincial finals where they lost to Lori McGeary.

In 1987, as a member of Kathy Fahlman&#x27;s rink, Schmirler won her first provincial championship, sending her to her first national championship, where she and her team finished in fourth place with a 7–5 win–loss record. The following season, the team lost in the A-B final of the 1988 provincials to Michelle Schneider (now Englot), eliminating them from a chance at a second straight trip to the Hearts. In the 1989 playdowns, Team Fahlman lost in the southern Saskatchewan playdowns, failing to even make it to the 1989 Saskatchewan Scott Tournament of Hearts.

Prior to the 1988–89 curling season, Schmirler and Jan Betker found themselves curling with different teammates, attempting to put together a stable squad. After a disappointing season, Schmirler decided to skip for the 1990–91 season, with Betker playing third. They recruited Joan Inglis (McCusker) to play second, and McCusker recommended Marcia Gudereit as a lead. This rink won the provincials in their first year together, defeating Kim Armbruster (Hodson) in the Saskatchewan final, 5–3. At the 1991 Scott Tournament of Hearts, the team finished in fourth place. In 1993, the Schmirler rink again won the provincial title, defeating Sherry Scheirich (Middaugh) in the final, 7–2. Representing Saskatchewan at the 1993 Scott Tournament of Hearts, her rink defeated Maureen Bonar in the finals, giving Saskatchewan its first national women&#x27;s curling championship since Marj Mitchell&#x27;s win in 1980. The rink moved on to the World Championship and defeated Janet Clews-Strayer from Germany in the final that year, winning Canada its sixth world women&#x27;s title. The next season, she and her rink competed at the Tournament of Hearts as defending champions. The team finished first in the round robin, and defeated Connie Laliberte in the final to clinch a second consecutive Canadian championship. She and her team then represented Canada at the World Women&#x27;s Curling Championship, where they finished first in the round robin. She then advanced to the playoffs, and won the semifinal against Josefine Einsle of Germany and the final against Christine Cannon of Scotland. With her win in the final, she and her team clinched their second world championships, equalling their run from the previous season. At the time, no other Canadian women&#x27;s rink had won consecutive world championships. Schmirler returned to the Tournament of Hearts the next year as the defending champion. She and her team finished with an 8–3 win–loss record and advanced to the playoffs as the second seed. She lost her next two games, however, and failed to advance to the final, losing a chance to win a third consecutive title. The next season, Schmirler added Renelle Bryden to the lineup, as McCusker took the year off. For the 1996 Saskatchewan Tournament of Hearts, Gudereit who had been playing second was replaced for health reasons by Karen Daku. At the provincial Hearts, the team fell to Sherry Scheirich (now Middaugh) in the final.

In 1997, Schmirler and her rink returned to the Tournament of Hearts, where they finished with a 9–2 win–loss record in the round robin. They advanced to the playoffs, and defeated Alison Goring of Ontario twice en route to winning her third Canadian championship. They then went to the World Championships, where they again finished first in the round robin and advanced to the playoffs, defeating Helena Blach Lavrsen of Denmark in the semifinals and Andrea Schöpp of Germany in the final to win a third world title. After each of these three seasons, her rink was named &quot;Team of the Year&quot; by Sask Sport.

In the 1998 Winter Olympics, curling became a medal sport for the first time. Olympic trials were held in November 1997 to select Canada&#x27;s representatives at the Olympics. Schmirler qualified for the Trials through a best of three series against Connie Laliberte held in December 1995. At the Trials, the Schmirler rink finished first in the round robin, and defeated Shannon Kleibrink in the final with a score of 9–6, behind strong shot making from Schmirler and McCusker. Schmirler made a difficult in-off to win and clinch the berth to the Olympics. The 1998 Winter Olympics were held in Nagano, Japan. The Schmirler rink was among the favourites for gold, but there was a strong field in the event. After finishing the round robin in first place with six wins and one loss, Canada played their semifinal game against Great Britain&#x27;s Kirsty Hay. The game was tied after regulation play and went to an extra end, where Schmirler barely made a draw with her last rock to win the game. In the final against Denmark&#x27;s Helena Blach Lavrsen, Schmirler secured a win in nine ends, winning Canada the gold medal. After winning the gold medal, Sandra appeared on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. After the Olympics, the Schmirler rink was named &#x27;Team of the Year&#x27; by the Canadian Press. The team were also inducted into the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame in 1999. After returning from the Olympics, Schmirler and her rink had to compete almost immediately in the Scott Tournament of Hearts as Team Canada. Schmirler and her team made the playoffs, and won the 3 vs. 4 playoff game before dropping the semifinal to Anne Merklinger. After losing in the semis, Schmirler joined CBC as a colour commentator for the final match.

===Career statistics===
==Personal life==

===Family and education===
Schmirler was born to parents Shirley and Art Schmirler on June 11, 1963. She was born with a club foot, which required her to wear a cast for two months. She had two older sisters, Carol and Beverley. She attended high school in Biggar, and moved to Saskatoon to attend university. She started out towards a degree in computer science, but transferred after her first year to work for a degree in physical education. She convocated with a Bachelor of Science in Physical Education in 1985.

In 1993, teammate Marcia Gudereit introduced Schmirler to Shannon England. On June 22, 1996, they were married. In 1997, Schmirler was pregnant with their first child. When this information was revealed to reporters at the Scott Tournament of Hearts, they jokingly dubbed her &quot;Schmirler the Hurler&quot;. On September 15, 1997, their daughter Sara Marion was born. In April 1999, Sandra&#x27;s father Art Schmirler died from esophageal cancer. On June 30, 1999, the couple&#x27;s second daughter, Jenna Shirley, was born.

===Illness and death===
After Jenna&#x27;s birth, Schmirler experienced many health problems. She had suffered from back pain, which was thought to be pregnancy related, and following Jenna&#x27;s birth, she began to suffer from stomach pains. Tests showed that a cancerous node the size of a fist had developed behind her heart. As her condition worsened, she underwent surgery on September 6, 1999. During surgery, a dead piece of the tumour broke off and released a blood clot into her lung. Her heart stopped beating, and only emergency heart massage kept her alive. Almost a month after being diagnosed with cancer, doctors finally provided a specific diagnosis – metastatic adenocarcinoma, with an unknown primary site. Because no one could pin down where the cancer came from, Sandra referred to it as &quot;the cancer from Mars.&quot; In addition to chemotherapy and radiation, Schmirler explored orthomolecular medicine through the Canadian Cancer Research Group. This form of alternative medicine involves large doses of vitamins and nutrients.

In 2000, Schmirler worked as colour commentator for CBC during Canada&#x27;s national junior curling championships. During her illness, Schmirler had been largely removed from the public eye. While in Moncton for the championships, Schmirler held a press conference to update her situation. In speaking publicly about her ordeal for the first time, Schmirler spared few details about what she had gone through, while also expressing her hope for the future: &quot;There were three goals I had coming out of this thing, and the first one was to look after my family. And the second one...because I curl so much, I&#x27;ve never taken a hot vacation, so I&#x27;m going to put my feet in the sand in a warm place. And the last one was to actually be here today, and I thank CBC, I thank Lawrence (Kimber), and Joan Mead.&quot;

After returning from Moncton, Schmirler felt physically well, but suffered a setback when a CAT scan revealed spots around her lungs. The decision was made not to proceed with further chemotherapy, but she continued with the orthomolecular therapy. She had been scheduled to work the 2000 Scott Tournament of Hearts, but was unable to do so. She faxed a statement from the hospital, which was read by TSN&#x27;s Vic Rauter. &quot;I&#x27;m still fighting hard and I still hope to make it to the Brier, not playing but talking. For Saskatchewan, I was hoping to be in your green shoes (at the Scott). But keep things in perspective. There are other things in life besides curling, which I have found. But I hope to be on the curling trail again next year. And I&#x27;ll see you all in Sudbury (the next Scott site) in 2001. Your curling friend, Sandra.&quot; However, the optimism in her statement belied the seriousness of her condition. She had been moved to palliative care. She died in her sleep at the Pasqua Hospital Palliative Care Unit on the morning of March 2, 2000, at age 36.

Her death caused reactions not just within Saskatchewan and the curling community, but also across the country. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien said in a statement: All Canadians have been touched by the untimely death of Sandra Schmirler. Most of us came to know her through her exploits as a champion curler and as an exemplary sports ambassador for Canada. But what really set her apart was her bright, engaging personality and her incredible zest for life, qualities that were so clearly in evidence as she fought so valiantly against her illness. She will be sorely missed. In honour of Schmirler, flags at provincial office buildings in Saskatchewan were lowered to half-staff.

TSN offered to broadcast her funeral live and to make the signal available to any other stations at no charge. Her husband, Shannon England, agreed to the broadcast on the condition that the family would not be shown during the service. CBC also broadcast the service, marking the first time a Canadian athlete&#x27;s funeral had been televised live on two networks. The Brier was just getting underway and games in the afternoon draw were delayed to allow curlers and fans to watch the funeral, which was broadcast on screens at the rink. Regina&#x27;s Agridome and Schmirler&#x27;s home Caledonian Curling Club also opened to show the funeral. Nine hundred people attended the service at the Regina Funeral Home, thousands watched at satellite locations around the province, and hundreds of thousands watched on television. The funeral was conducted by the Rev. Don Wells, and Sandra was eulogized by Brian McCusker, teammate Joan McCusker&#x27;s husband.

==Awards and honours==
In addition to the titles captured by her team on the ice, Schmirler has been recognized in several different ways off the ice as well. In 2000, Schmirler was awarded the Saskatchewan Order of Merit, becoming the first posthumous recipient. Along with the other members of her rink, she had been previously awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Regina. In the fall of 2000, Schmirler was inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame. Schmirler and her team were inducted into the Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame on two separate occasions, once in 1997 for winning three World Curling Championships and once in 2001 for winning the gold medal at the Olympics. At the annual Scotties Tournament of Hearts, the top player in the playoff round is awarded the Sandra Schmirler Most Valuable Player Award.

After her death, the city of Regina honoured Schmirler in several ways. The South East Leisure Centre where she used to work was renamed the &quot;Sandra Schmirler Leisure Centre,&quot; and the road leading up to the Callie Curling Club, where her team curled out of, was renamed &quot;Sandra Schmirler Way.&quot; Schmirler&#x27;s hometown of Biggar also honoured her memory with the construction of &quot;The Sandra Schmirler Olympic Gold Park.&quot;

“The Sandra Schmirler Foundation was created in May 2001 by a group of Sandra’s friends and teammates. Their vision was to create a living legacy in honour of this amazing woman who touched the hearts of so many Canadians from coast to coast to coast.
While she lost her biggest battle, her legacy lives on. The lives of countless babies born premature and critically ill have been, and continue to be saved, with life-saving equipment the Foundation has funded in her name. 
Millions of dollars have been given to hospital NICUs in every province, the Yukon and Northwest Territories to fund life-saving equipment for babies born too soon, too small or too sick. This list continues to grow every year with the generous support of our many donors.
Sandra reached out to her country in sickness and in health and made us understand what really matters in life. While we mourn her passing, we celebrate the lasting legacy she left behind.” Robin Wilson

On January 7, 2009, Sandra was named the winner of the 2009 World Curling Freytag Award (later incorporated into the WCF Hall of Fame). The award, named after American Elmer Freytag, who founded the World Curling Federation, honours curlers for championship play, sportsmanship, character and extraordinary achievement. Her husband and daughters accepted the award on her behalf at the 2009 World Men&#x27;s Curling Championship.

<text>Werner Erhard and Associates, also known as WE&amp;A or as WEA, was a commercial personal development program which operated from 1984 until early 1991. It replaced Erhard Seminars Training. Initially WE&amp;A marketed and staged &quot;est&quot; training (in the form of the &quot;est&quot; seminars and workshops), but in 1984 the est training was replaced by WE&amp;A with a briefer, a less authoritarian and more marketable program based on Werner Erhard&#x27;s teachings and called The Forum.

In 1991 Erhard sold the assets of WE&amp;A to a group of employees, who later formed Landmark Education. Erhard then retired and left the United States.

== Timeline ==

== The Forum ==
&quot;Evaluating a Large Group Awareness Training&quot;, a longitudinal study published by Springer in the series &quot;Recent Research in Psychology&quot; in 1990 concluded that attending the Forum had minimal lasting effects — positive or negative — on participants.
The research won an American Psychological Association &quot;National Psychological Consultants to Management Award&quot; in 1989. The results of the research study appeared in two articles in the &quot;Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology&quot; in 1989 and in 1990,

Public-opinion analyst Daniel Yankelovich did an investigation of the response of participants to their experience of the Forum. Yankelovich reported that &quot;more than seven out of ten participants found the Forum to be one of their life&#x27;s most rewarding experiences&quot;. The study reported that 95 percent of Forum graduates believe the Forum had &quot;specific, practical value&quot; for many aspects of their lives, and 86 percent of those surveyed said that it helped them &quot;cope with a particular challenge or problem&quot;.

<text>George Bernard Worrell, Jr. (April 19, 1944 – June 24, 2016) was an American keyboardist and record producer best known as a founding member of the Parliament-Funkadelic collective. In later years, he also worked with acts such as Talking Heads, Bill Laswell, and Jack Bruce. He is a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, inducted in 1997 with fifteen other members of Parliament-Funkadelic. Worrell was described by journalist Jon Pareles as &quot;the kind of sideman who is as influential as some bandleaders,&quot; with his use of synthesizers particularly impactful on funk and hip hop.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Worrell was born in Long Branch, New Jersey, and grew up in Plainfield, New Jersey, where his family moved when he was eight. A musical prodigy, he began formal piano lessons by age three and wrote a concerto at age eight. He went on to study at the Juilliard School and received a degree from the New England Conservatory of Music in 1967. As a college student, Worrell played with a group called Chubby &amp; The Turnpikes; this ensemble eventually evolved into Tavares.

===1970s===
After meeting George Clinton, leader of a Plainfield-based doo wop group called The Parliaments, Worrell moved with Clinton, The Parliaments and their backing band, The Funkadelics, to Detroit, Michigan; thereafter, both groups became collectively known as Parliament-Funkadelic. During the 1970s the same group of musicians separately recorded under the names Parliament and Funkadelic, (among several others), but toured as P-Funk. Worrell played grand piano, Wurlitzer electric piano, Hohner Clavinet, Hammond B3 organ, ARP String Ensemble and Moog synthesizer, co-wrote, and wrote horn and rhythm arrangements on hit recordings for both groups and other associated bands under the &quot;Parliafunkadelicment Thang&quot; production company, and many of his most notable performances were recorded with Bootsy&#x27;s Rubber Band, Parlet, The Brides of Funkenstein and The Horny Horns. Worrell recorded a 1978 solo album, &quot;All the Woo in the World&quot;, with the musical backing of P-Funk&#x27;s members.

While funk musicians traditionally utilized electric keyboards, such as the Hammond organ and Fender Rhodes electric piano, Worrell was the second recipient of the Moog synthesizer created by Bob Moog. Mainly responsible for creating Parliament&#x27;s futuristic sound, Worrell&#x27;s use of the Minimoog bass on the Parliament song &quot;Flash Light&quot;, on 1977&#x27;s &quot;Funkentelechy Vs. the Placebo Syndrome&quot;, heavily influenced the sound of R&amp;B music and served as a bridge between American R&amp;B and the insurgence of new wave, new age and techno. He used the ARP Pro Soloist as well. Worrell played synthesizer and digital keyboard on P funk songs throughout the 1970s, most notably &quot;Mothership Connection (Star Child)&quot; and &quot;Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker)&quot; from &quot;Mothership Connection&quot; (1975) and &quot;Aqua Boogie&quot; from &quot;Motor Booty Affair&quot; (1978).

===1980s===
When Parliament-Funkadelic took a hiatus from touring in the early 1980s, Worrell was recruited, along with other musicians from differing musical genres such as guitarist Adrian Belew, to perform and record with Talking Heads. Worrell&#x27;s experience and feel for different arrangements enhanced the overall sound of the band. Though he never officially joined Talking Heads, he was a &quot;de facto&quot; member of the group for most of the &#x27;80s: appearing on one of their studio albums, several solo albums, two tours and performing in their 1984 concert film &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot;. Talking Heads officially disbanded in 1991. Worrell was later invited to perform with Talking Heads as part of their 2002 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

In 1983, Worrell provided keyboard parts for Mtume&#x27;s hit song &quot;Juicy Fruit&quot;.

Worrell co-produced Fred Schneider&#x27;s 1984 solo album &quot;Fred Schneider and the Shake Society&quot; and played keyboards and synthesizers on some of the album&#x27;s tracks.
In 1987 he appeared on the critically acclaimed solo release &quot;Casual Gods&quot; by Jerry Harrison of Talking Heads. The LP contained the US Album Rock Tracks chart hit &quot;Rev It Up&quot;, which reached number seven and appeared in the movie &quot;Something Wild&quot;. He worked with Jerry Harrison on his other releases also.

===1990s–2010s===
From the late 1980s through the 2010s, Worrell recorded extensively with Bill Laswell, including Sly and Robbie&#x27;s Laswell-produced &quot;Rhythm Killers&quot; and the 1985 Fela Kuti album &quot;Army Arrangement&quot;. Worrell performed with Gov&#x27;t Mule. Through the beginning of the 21st century, he became a visible member of the jam band scene, performing in many large summer music festivals, sometimes billed as Bernie Worrell and the Woo Warriors. He appeared on several Jack Bruce albums, including &quot;A Question of Time&quot;, &quot;Cities of the Heart&quot;, &quot;Monkjack&quot; and &quot;More Jack than God&quot;.

Worrell was a founding member of the CBS Orchestra when the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; launched in August 1993, playing lead synthesizer. Worrell departed in November when the orchestra added a horn section.

In 1994, Worrell appeared on the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album, &quot;Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool&quot;. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in the African-American community, was heralded as &quot;Album of the Year&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

Worrell joined the rock group Black Jack Johnson, with Mos Def, Will Calhoun, Doug Wimbish and Dr. Know. He appears with the band on Mos Def&#x27;s 2004 release &quot;The New Danger&quot;.

Worrell joined forces with bass legend Les Claypool, guitarist Buckethead and drummer Bryan Mantia to form the group Colonel Claypool&#x27;s Bucket of Bernie Brains.

In 2009, he joined longtime Parliament-Funkadelic guitarist DeWayne &quot;Blackbyrd&quot; McKnight, bassist Melvin Gibbs and drummer J.T. Lewis to form the band SociaLybrium. Their album &quot;For You/For Us/For All&quot; was released on Livewired Music in January 2010.

Worrell appeared in the 2004 documentary film &quot;Moog&quot; with synthesizer pioneer Bob Moog and several other Moog synthesizer musicians. In 2011, he toured with Bootsy Collins, another major figure from Parliament-Funkadelic.

From 2011 through 2015, Worrell performed with his group, the Bernie Worrell Orchestra. The band became known for the appearance of special guests at live performances, including Bootsy Collins, Tina Weymouth, Chris Frantz, Jimmy Destri, Mike Watt, Rah Digga and Gary Lucas.

In 2012 and 2013, Worrell played a series of concerts with guitarist Steve Kimock, bassist Andy Hess, and vocalist-percussionist Camille Armstrong. Kimock&#x27;s son John Morgan Kimock played drums for the group in 2013.

Worrell worked on the Seattle-based Khu.éex&#x27; project fusing traditional Tlingit music with funk, jazz, and experimental music. The project includes Preston Singletary, Skerik, Stanton Moore, Captain Raab and Randall Dunn among others.

In 2015, Worrell appeared in the movie &quot;Ricki and the Flash&quot; as the keyboard player in Meryl Streep&#x27;s band. The movie reunited Worrell with director Jonathan Demme, who had directed &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot;.

Worrell was a judge for the 12th, 13th, and 14th annual Independent Music Awards.

During May 2016, the New England Conservatory of Music gave Worrell, who studied at the school until 1967, an honorary Doctor of Music degree.

==Death==
In January 2016, Worrell was diagnosed with a &quot;mild form&quot; of prostate cancer, stage-four liver cancer and stage-four lung cancer. He relocated from New Jersey, his long-time home, to Bellingham, Washington.

A tribute and benefit concert to raise funds for Worrell&#x27;s cancer treatment, produced by the Black Rock Coalition and featuring musicians with whom Worrell has worked over his career, occurred on April 4 and 5, 2016.

On May 9, Worrell&#x27;s wife Judie posted an update on his condition on his Facebook page:

Judie Worrell issued a statement on Facebook on June 16 to friends and family that &quot;I was just told that Bernie is now headed &#x27;Home&#x27;.&quot; She encouraged people close to Worrell to &quot;visit him to say your goodbyes&quot; and added that he is too ill to speak on the phone or text.

Bernie Worrell died at his home in Everson, Washington, on June 24, 2016, at the age of 72. His wife issued a statement that &quot;Bernie transitioned Home to The Great Spirit. Rest in peace, my love—you definitely made the world a better place. Till we meet again, vaya con Dios.&quot;

Following his death, guitarist Buckethead created a 21.5 minute long tribute song: &#x27;Space Viking&#x27;. Buckethead published it on his &#x27;Pike&#x27; series, as part of Pike 245. The song was captioned: &quot;To Bernie Worrell, The Greatest Music Maker Of All&quot;.

==Documentary==
&quot;Stranger: Bernie Worrell on Earth&quot; is a documentary film about Worrell&#x27;s life, music and impact. At AllMovie, critic Mark Deming wrote that the film &quot;profiles his life and career while also examining how even a genius has to find a way to make a living&quot;.

<text>Sila María Calderón Serra (born September 23, 1942) is a Puerto Rican politician, businesswoman, and philanthropist who was the governor of Puerto Rico from 2001 to 2005, becoming the first female to be elected and serve as governor in Puerto Rican history. Prior to her term as governor, Calderón held various positions in the government of Puerto Rico, including the 12th Secretary of State of Puerto Rico from 1988 to 1989, and Chief of Staff to Governor Rafael Hernández Colón. She was also mayor of San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico, from 1997 to 2001.

==Early life and education==
Sila Calderón Serra was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico on September 23, 1942, to entrepreneur César Augusto Calderón and Sila Serra Jesús. Her maternal grandfather Miguel Serra Joy emigrated from Mallorca, Balearic Islands to Puerto Rico in the late 19th century which granted Calderón Spanish citizenship in 2012. She attended high school at the Colegio Sagrado Corazón de Las Madres in Santurce, Puerto Rico. In 1964 she graduated with honors from Manhattanville College in Purchase, New York, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Government. She later attended the Graduate School of Public Administration at the University of Puerto Rico.

==Professional career==
===First career years: 1973–1985===
Her career began in 1973 when she was named Executive Aide to the Labor Secretary, Luis Silva Recio. Two years later, she was named Special Aide for Economic Development to then Governor, Rafael Hernández Colón.

After Hernández Colón was defeated in the 1976 general elections, Calderón went to work on the private sector working as Director of Business Development at Citibank, N.A. in San Juan. At the time, Citibank in San Juan was one of John Reed&#x27;s experimental marketing centers. As part of her business development responsibilities, Calderón designed and marketed several new consumer products which significantly increased the earnings of the Retail Division of the Bank. In 1978, she became president of Commonwealth Investment Company, a family real estate concern that owned and managed industrial buildings.

===First government positions: 1985–1990===
In 1984, Rafael Hernández Colón was again elected governor and he appointed Calderón as Chief of Staff, being the first woman in that position. In 1988, Hernández Colón named her Puerto Rico&#x27;s 12th Secretary of State.

During this time, Calderón was also part of the Governor&#x27;s Economic Adviser Council and the board of directors of the Puerto Rico Government Development Bank and the Center for Specialized Studies in Government Management. She also presided the Inversions Committee of the Industrial Development Company. She was also Secretary General of the Commission that organized the activities of the Fifth Centenary of the Discovery of the Americas.

===Return to private life: 1989–1995===
Calderón resigned in 1989 and returned to her business endeavors. She served on the boards of major local corporations such as BanPonce, Banco Popular, and Pueblo International. She also served as part of the Committee for Economic Development of Puerto Rico, the Sor Isolina Ferré Foundation, and as President of the Puerto Rico Public Broadcasting Corporation during 1991 and 1992.

==Political career==
===Mayor of San Juan: 1997–2001===
Calderón returned to public life in 1995, running in the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) primary for Mayor of San Juan. She won the primary handily over her two opponents by a huge margin. After that, she became President of the Municipal Committee of the PPD in San Juan, and later became part of the board of directors of the Party.

In the 1996 mayoral general election, she was elected Mayor of San Juan, becoming the second woman in the city&#x27;s history to serve in that office and the first woman elected to the position. As mayor, she undertook one of the largest public works program in the city to date, sponsoring various urban redevelopment projects to revitalize Old San Juan, Condado, Río Piedras, Santurce, and other deteriorated sections of the city. She also initiated the Special Communities Program to assist poor communities’ empowerment and economic development.

===Governor: 2001–2004===
On April 21, 1999, Calderón presented her candidacy to be Governor of Puerto Rico. On May 31, she won the primary and took the presidency of the party, with then-President Aníbal Acevedo Vilá assuming the role of Vice-president. Acevedo Vilá eventually became Calderón&#x27;s running mate for Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico.

In 2000, Calderón led the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) during a close campaign for governor against Carlos Pesquera (PNP) and Rubén Berríos (PIP). Calderón was elected governor, becoming the first elected female governor in the history of Puerto Rico. After being sworn in, Calderón appointed her two daughters, Sila Mari and María Elena, to serve as First Ladies.

As governor, Calderón took action to help the most disadvantaged communities. With the passing of Law 1 of 2001 the government invested $1 billion to create the Puerto Rico Office for Socioeconomic and Community Development with the intention of developing the marginalized communities of the island. The program intended to create 14,500 development projects in 686 communities. The program has been criticized for many of the projects never being completed and funds instead being diverted.

In 2003, Calderón announced her determination to fulfill the commitments of her platform and her decision not to seek re-election in 2004.

On May 26, 2004, Calderón had to deal with a man who entered La Fortaleza, the governor&#x27;s mansion, with a knife and took a receptionist hostage, demanding to speak directly with Calderón. After Calderón negotiated with the hostage taker, the man dropped the knife and surrendered to the police.

==Present==
Calderón is a partner in Inter-American Global Links, Inc. (IGlobaL), a business and trade consulting firm with links in Central America, the Caribbean and the United States. She chairs a philanthropic Foundation which has establish a non-profit and non-partisan entity – The Center for Puerto Rico: Sila M. Calderón Foundation – which gives attention to the issues of poverty, women, urban revitalization, ethical values and social responsibility.

==Honours and awards==

During her career, Calderón has received many honors and awards:

* The Puerto Rico Chamber of Commerce named her Outstanding Woman in the Public Sector three times (1975, 1985, 1987). 
* In 2005, she was named as one of the Distinguished Women of the Year by the Product Association of Puerto Rico.
* In 1987, she was granted the Order of Isabella the Catholic by Juan Carlos I, King of Spain.
* In 1988, she was selected Leader of the Year in the field of Public Works by the American Public Works Association, Chapter of Puerto Rico.
* In 2003, she received the Harvard Foundation Award.
* In 2004, she received the Golden Plate Award from the Academy of Achievement in Washington, DC.

Calderón has also received several honorary degrees:

* 1989 – Manhattanville College – Doctor in Arts and Humanities
* May 1997 – Manhattanville College – Doctor of Humane Letters
* May 2001 – Boston University – Doctor of Laws 
* May 2001 – New School University – Doctor of Laws

During her tenure, Calderón gave particular attention to strengthening the economic, commercial and cultural ties between Puerto Rico and its Latin American neighbors. Underlining this effort, official visits were paid by Governor Calderón to the Dominican Republic, Panama and Costa Rica in the years 2001, 2002 and 2004. In recognition of her administration&#x27;s efforts of collaboration between these countries and Puerto Rico, their governments bestowed upon her their most important civil orders: the Order of Merit of Duarte, Sánchez and Mella of the Dominican Republic; the Order of Núñez de Balboa of Panama; and the Order of Juan Santamaría of Costa Rica.

==Personal life==
Calderón was married to engineer Francisco Xavier González Goenaga from 1964 to 1975. They had three children together: Sila María, Francisco Xavier, and María Elena. Both Sila María and María Elena are attorneys, and they served as &quot;First Ladies&quot; of the Commonwealth during Calderón&#x27;s governorship. Francisco is an investment banker at RBC Capital Markets.

In 1978, Calderón married entrepreneur Adolfo Krans. They divorced in 2001 after 23 years of marriage.

Calderón married again, during her tenure as governor, with Ramón Cantero Frau, her former Secretary of the Department of Economic Development. The wedding was celebrated on September 10, 2003. They were divorced two years later.

<doc id="113347" wikidata="Q2342581" url="?curid=113347" title="Constant folding">
<text>Constant folding and constant propagation are related compiler optimizations used by many modern compilers. An advanced form of constant propagation known as sparse conditional constant propagation can more accurately propagate constants and simultaneously remove dead code.

== Constant folding ==

Constant folding is the process of recognizing and evaluating constant expressions at compile time rather than computing them at runtime. Terms in constant expressions are typically simple literals, such as the integer literal codice_1, but they may also be variables whose values are known at compile time. Consider the statement:
 i = 320 * 200 * 32;
Most compilers would not actually generate two multiply instructions and a store for this statement. Instead, they identify constructs such as these and substitute the computed values at compile time (in this case, codice_2).

Constant folding can make use of arithmetic identities. If codice_3 is numeric, the value of codice_4 is zero even if the compiler does not know the value of codice_3 (note that this is not valid for IEEE floats since codice_3 could be Infinity or NaN. Still, some environments that favor performance such as GLSL shaders allow this for constants, which can occasionally cause bugs). 

Constant folding may apply to more than just numbers. Concatenation of string literals and constant strings can be constant folded. Code such as codice_7 may be replaced with codice_8.

== Constant folding and cross compilation ==

In implementing a cross compiler, care must be taken to ensure that the behaviour of the arithmetic operations on the host architecture matches that on the target architecture, as otherwise enabling constant folding will change the behaviour of the program. This is of particular importance in the case of floating point operations, whose precise implementation may vary widely.

== Constant propagation ==

Constant propagation is the process of substituting the values of known constants in expressions at compile time. Such constants include those defined above, as well as intrinsic functions applied to constant values. Consider the following pseudocode:
 int x = 14;
 int y = 7 - x / 2;
 return y * (28 / x + 2);
Propagating x yields:
 int x = 14;
 int y = 7 - 14 / 2;
 return y * (28 / 14 + 2);
Continuing to propagate yields the following (which would likely be further optimized by dead-code elimination of both x and y.)
 int x = 14;
 int y = 0;
 return 0;
Constant propagation is implemented in compilers using reaching definition analysis results. If all a variable&#x27;s reaching definitions are the same assignment - which assigns a same constant to the variable - then the variable will always have the same value, and can be replaced with the constant.

Constant propagation can also cause conditional branches to simplify to one or more unconditional statements, if the conditional expression can be evaluated to true or false at compile time to determine the only possible outcome.

== The optimizations in action ==

Constant folding and propagation are typically used together to achieve many simplifications and reductions, and their interleaved, iterative application continues until those effects cease.

Consider this unoptimized pseudocode returning a number unknown pending analysis:
 int a = 30;
 int b = 9 - (a / 5);
 int c = b * 4;
 if (c &gt; 10) {
 c = c - 10;
 return c * (60 / a);
Applying constant propagation once, followed by constant folding, yields:
 int a = 30;
 int b = 3;
 int c = b * 4;
 if (c &gt; 10) {
 c = c - 10;
 return c * 2;
Repeating both steps twice produces:
 int a = 30;
 int b = 3;
 int c = 12;
 if (true) {
 c = 2;
 return c * 2;
Having replaced all uses of variables codice_9 and codice_10 with constants, the compiler&#x27;s dead-code elimination applies to those variables, leaving:
 int c = 12;

 if (true) {
 c = 2;
 return c * 2;
(Boolean constructs vary among languages and compilers, but their details—such as the status, origin, and representation of true—do not affect these optimization principles.)

Traditional constant propagation produces no further optimization; it does not restructure programs.

However, a similar optimization, sparse conditional constant propagation, goes further by selecting the appropriate conditional branch, and removing the always-true conditional test. Thus, variable codice_11 becomes redundant, and only an operation on a constant remains:
 return 4;
If that pseudocode constitutes a function body, the compiler knows the function evaluates to integer constant codice_12, allowing replacement of calls to the function with codice_12, and further increasing program efficiency.

<text>Howard Allan Stern (born January 12, 1954) is an American broadcaster and media personality. He is best known for his radio show, &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, which gained popularity when it was nationally syndicated on terrestrial radio from 1986 to 2005. He has broadcast on Sirius XM since 2006.

Stern landed his first radio jobs while at Boston University. From 1976 to 1982, he developed his on-air personality through morning positions at WRNW in Briarcliff Manor, New York; WCCC in Hartford, Connecticut; WWWW in Detroit, Michigan; and WWDC in Washington, D.C. He worked afternoons at WNBC in New York City from 1982 until his firing in 1985. In 1985, he began a 20-year run at WXRK in New York City; his morning show entered syndication in 1986 and aired in 60 markets and attracted 20 million listeners at its peak. In recent years, Stern&#x27;s photography has been featured in &quot;Hamptons&quot; and &quot;WHIRL&quot; magazines. From 2012 to 2015, he served as a judge on &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;.

Stern has won numerous industry awards, including &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Nationally Syndicated Air Personality of the Year eight consecutive times, and he is the first to have the number one morning show in New York City and Los Angeles simultaneously. He became the most fined radio host when the Federal Communications Commission issued fines totaling $2.5 million to station owners for content it deemed indecent. Stern became one of the highest-paid radio figures after signing a five-year deal with Sirius in 2004 worth $500 million.

Stern has described himself as the &quot;King of All Media&quot; since 1992 for his successes outside radio. He hosted and produced numerous late-night television shows, pay-per-view events, and home videos. Two of his books, &quot;Private Parts&quot; (1993) and &quot;Miss America&quot; (1995), entered &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list at number one and sold over one million copies. The former was made into a biographical comedy film in 1997 that had Stern and his radio show staff star as themselves. It topped the US box office in its opening week and grossed $41.2 million domestically. Stern performs on its soundtrack, which charted the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number one and was certified platinum for one million copies sold. Stern&#x27;s third book, &quot;Howard Stern Comes Again&quot;, was released in 2019.

==Early life and education==
Howard Allan Stern was born on January 12, 1954, the second child of Ben (1923–2022) and Ray (&quot;née&quot; Schiffman) Stern (b. 1927), in the Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens in New York City. Stern&#x27;s parents are Jewish. Their families are from Poland and Austria-Hungary. Ray was an office clerk in New York City before she became a homemaker and later took up work as an inhalation therapist. Ben served in the U.S. Army on Long Island and in California during the war. He later worked as a radio engineer at WHOM in Manhattan and as a co-owner and operator at Aura Recording Inc., a Manhattan recording studio where cartoons and commercials were cut. Stern described his older sister Ellen as the &quot;complete opposite&quot; of himself and &quot;very quiet.&quot; 

In 1955, the family moved to Roosevelt, New York, on Long Island, where Stern attended Washington-Rose Elementary School followed by Roosevelt Junior-Senior High School. Stern also attended Hebrew school where he was given the name Tzvi. As a youngster Stern took five years of piano lessons and took an interest in marionettes, using them to entertain his friends with explicit shows. He formed a band with two school friends, the Electric Comicbook, on vocals and keyboards. From the age of nine to his second year at university, Stern spent his summers at Camp Wel-Met, a youth camp in Narrowsburg, New York where he worked camper, kitchen, and counselor duties. He recalled his time there as &quot;the greatest experience.&quot; 

Stern wished to be in radio at the age of five. He was an infrequent listener in his youth, but names talk personalities Bob Grant and Brad Crandall as early influences. His father set up a microphone, tape machine, and turntable in the basement of his home, which Stern used to record his make-believe radio shows, incorporating different characters and pre-recorded prank calls, sketches, and commercials. He made several visits to his father&#x27;s recording studio and witnessed &quot;some of the great voice guys&quot; work with him, including Don Adams and Larry Storch voice &quot;Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales&quot;, which began his desire to be on the air and &quot;do a show&quot;, rather than play records.

In the late 1960s, Roosevelt became a predominantly black area; Stern remembered just &quot;a handful of white kids&quot; had remained in his school and repeated instances of bullying from black students. In June 1969, the family moved to nearby Rockville Centre, and Stern, at age fifteen, transferred to South Side High School where he became &quot;a total introvert.&quot; He graduated from the school in 1972; his yearbook lists Stern&#x27;s sole student activity, a membership of Key Club.

In 1972, Stern declined a place at Elmira College to instead pursue a communications degree at Boston University, but his average high school grades caused him to spend the first two years in its College of Basic Studies. In his second year, he started work at the campus radio station WTBU, where he played records, read the news, and hosted interview programs. With three fellow students, he later co-hosted a weekly comedy show named &quot;The King Schmaltz Bagel Hour&quot;, which was initially canceled during its first broadcast for a racial sketch named &quot;Godzilla Goes to Harlem&quot;. Stern took cannabis, Quaaludes, and LSD during his studies, but he quit after he experienced a difficult trip on too much LSD.

In 1974, he gained admission to the university&#x27;s School of Public Communications. He then studied for a diploma at the Radio Engineering Institute of Electronics in Fredericksburg, Virginia, in July 1975, which earned him a first-class radio-telephone operator license, a required certificate for all radio broadcasters at the time, which was issued by the Federal Communications Commission. With the license, Stern landed his first professional radio job at WNTN in Newton, Massachusetts from August to December 1975 doing air shifts, news casting, and production work. For the next five months, he taught students basic electronics in preparation for their own FCC exams.

In May 1976, Stern graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; with a 3.8-grade point average. His major was broadcasting and film, and his minor was English and speech. In the past, he funded a scholarship at the university.

==Career==
===1976–1981: WRNW, WCCC, and WWWW===
In his search for radio work following his graduation, Stern took up an offer to work evenings at WRNW, a progressive rock station in Briarcliff Manor, New York. He was unsure of his talent and questioned his future as a professional in the industry, writing &quot;I freaked out. I got real nervous that I wasn&#x27;t good enough&quot;. Stern accepted a marketing role at Benton &amp; Bowles, a New York advertising agency, which he soon &quot;quit without giving notice&quot; in favor of a position in the creative department. He lasted three hours before he was fired &quot;because their personnel department realized that I was the guy who just quit&quot;. Stern then worked in Queens as a radio salesman selling advertising time without considerable success. He wrote, &quot;All of a sudden ... I realized I had turned down a job in radio&quot;. With encouragement from his mother and girlfriend, Stern contacted WRNW for work and agreed to take cover shifts surrounding the Christmas holidays in 1976. Impressed with his reliability and professional approach, the station&#x27;s director hired Stern full-time for a four-hour midday shift for six days a week, for $96 a week. After several months, Stern became the station&#x27;s production director, which lasted until November 1977 when he became its program director for an increased salary of $250 a week. To save money, Stern rented a room in a monastery in Armonk, New York.

In 1979, Stern spotted an advertisement in &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; for a &quot;wild, fun morning guy&quot; at rock station WCCC in Hartford, Connecticut. He used some morning airtime to assemble an aircheck with more outrageous bits, including Robert Klein and Cheech and Chong records with added flatulence routines and one-liners. Stern was hired for the same salary but worked a more intense schedule. After four hours on the air, he voiced and produced commercials for another four. On Saturdays, following a six-hour show, he did production work for the next three. He also completed duties as the station&#x27;s public affairs director and hosted a Sunday morning talk show that he favored above playing records, as it &quot;represented what I wanted to do on the radio more than anything. Take the average guy and dissect what he does&quot;. In the summer of the 1979 energy crisis, Stern urged listeners to a two-day boycott of Shell Oil Company, a stunt that attracted media attention. It was at WCCC where Stern first met Fred Norris, the overnight disc jockey, who went on to become Stern&#x27;s writer and producer since 1981. Stern left WCCC in early 1980 after he was denied a &quot;lousy, stinking twenty-five-dollar-a-week raise&quot;. At the same time, local rival station WHCN had assembled tapes and press clippings of Stern and forwarded them to Burkhart/Abrams, a radio consulting firm, to get Stern out of the Hartford market as a rise in his ratings increased his threat to the station&#x27;s numbers. The tapes were received by Dwight Douglas, a consultant at Burkhart/Abrams, who offered Stern work in Columbus, Ohio, but Stern declined.

In his search for new work, Stern found an advertised position in &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; for a morning host at WWWW, a struggling rock station in Detroit, Michigan. His aircheck was well received by management who made an offer, but Douglas advised Stern against the move and suggested he wait for an offer from a better station. Stern went ahead regardless and accepted a deal, starting on April 21, 1980. He thought of new ways to improve his show and to be more open on the air, &quot;to cut down the barriers ... strip down all the ego ... and be totally honest&quot;. His efforts paid off with his first industry recognition, winning a &quot;Billboard&quot; Award for Album-Oriented Rock Personality of the Year For a Major Market and the debut Top Five Talent Search contest in the album-oriented rock category from radio syndication firm Drake-Chenault, which then distributed the winning radio segments to stations across the country. Despite the success, WWWW continued to decline in the ratings and failed to overtake the three more popular rock stations in the area. The quarterly Arbitron ratings released in January 1981 showed no signs of a strong audience, causing the station to change formats overnight from rock to country music, to Stern&#x27;s surprise and annoyance. He lasted another two weeks before &quot;it was time to hit the road again. Somehow, I couldn&#x27;t see myself as Hopalong Howie&quot;. He declined offers to work at WXRT in Chicago and CHUM in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

===1981–1985: WWDC and WNBC===
Douglas found Stern&#x27;s next job, hosting mornings at album-oriented rock station WWDC in Washington, D.C. Stern was cautious about the offer at first as the general manager &quot;was not really aware of what I did,&quot; but he accepted the offer and started on March 2, 1981. During his time relocating from Detroit, Stern spent several weeks planning out a new show, determined to become more successful as the station presented a good chance for him to work in New York City, his career goal. He was determined to &quot;kill my competition. I was going to say whatever the fuck I was going to say ... The first step was to put my team together&quot;. He sought a co-host with a sense of humor to riff with on news and current events. The station then paired Stern with Robin Quivers, a former nurse in the air force and news reporter at WFBR in Baltimore. Quivers was sent a tape of Stern interviewing a prostitute on the air, and she accepted the job without meeting him. She assumed she &quot;would come in and do the news ... but it wasn&#x27;t that way&quot;. Despite several issues management had over content, which led to the installation of a seven-second delay to censor questionable moments, Stern &quot;kept chipping away at management&#x27;s archaic approach, and we began to assemble the program I had envisioned&quot;, which included the addition of Norris as his writer and producer. In one incident, Stern revealed his wife&#x27;s miscarriage on the air. In January 1982, Stern had the second highest-rated morning show in the city.

Impressed with his rapid rise in the ratings, WWDC management offered Stern an initial one-year extension to his contract, but Stern wished for a more long-term deal. At the same time, he was offered a five-year deal worth $1 million to work afternoons at WNBC in New York City, then an adult contemporary station, after radio manager Jerry Nachman became a fan of Stern and suggested his name to the station. Stern signed with WNBC in March 1982, four months before his contract with WWDC was to expire. His relationship with station management declined from then on, and he repeatedly criticized them and other deejays on the air, including an incident when he revealed the manager&#x27;s salary. The situation culminated on June 25, 1982, when Stern was terminated from the station. Towards the end of his stay, Stern had more than tripled his ratings since he began, and &quot;The Washingtonian&quot; named him the city&#x27;s best disc jockey. It was often believed that Stern was suspended over a controversial bit regarding the 1982 crash of Air Florida Flight 90 that made people believe he had called the airline and asked for prices to the 14th Street bridge, the site of the crash, and if it would be a &quot;regular stop&quot;. But Stern said it was false, claiming &quot;no one ever complained about it&quot;. In his last few months, Stern secured a $35,000 advance deal with Wren Records to produce a comedy album of song parodies with Norris, titled &quot;50 Ways to Rank Your Mother&quot;. It was reissued in 1994 as &quot;Unclean Beaver&quot;.
In April 1982, four months before he started at WNBC, &quot;NBC Magazine&quot; aired a critical news report on shock radio by Douglas Kiker that centered around Stern and the controversial nature of his show. The piece caused NBC executives to discuss the potential withdrawal of Stern&#x27;s contract, but rather than spend money on buying Stern out of the deal, management agreed to control Stern. To make matters worse, the station did not allow Stern to bring his show partners at first, which caused some friction between Stern and Quivers for several months. Stern began his afternoon show at WNBC on August 30, 1982, and was closely monitored, instructed to avoid discussions of a sexual or religious nature. In his first month, he was suspended for &quot;Virgin Mary Kong&quot;, a sketch about a video game where a group of men pursued the Virgin Mary around a singles bar in Jerusalem. The station then hired an attorney to operate a seven-second delay if Stern said something potentially offensive. This soon became the task of program director Kevin Metheny, who Stern infamously feuded with and nicknamed &quot;Pig Virus&quot;. While at WNBC, Stern also began his longtime feud with its morning host Don Imus.

In 1984, Stern acquired Don Buchwald as his agent, who supervised Stern&#x27;s new three-year contract with WNBC in early 1985. His popularity with the audience grew despite management&#x27;s continual restrictions. On May 21, 1984, he made his debut appearance on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; and was featured in &quot;People&quot; magazine, increasing his national exposure. Around this time Stern appeared in the low budget comedy film &quot;Ryder, P.I.&quot; (1986) as Ben Wah, an out of control newscaster, for which he was paid $1,000. In May 1985, Stern claimed the highest ratings at WNBC in four years with a 5.7% market share of the afternoon audience. In a sudden turn of events, Stern and Quivers were fired shortly before they were to go on air on September 30, 1985, for what WNBC management termed &quot;conceptual differences&quot; regarding the show. Program director John Hayes explained: &quot;Over the course of time we made a very conscious effort to make Stern aware that certain elements of the program should be changed ... I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s appropriate to say what those specifics were&quot;. Stern was not told whose decision it was. In 1992, he believed Thornton Bradshaw, chairman of WNBC owner RCA, heard his &quot;Bestiality Dial-a-Date&quot; segment that aired ten days before his suspension and ordered the show&#x27;s cancellation.

===1985–1993: WXRK and early television and video projects===
After his firing from WNBC, Stern kept in touch with his audience by booking dates at clubs with a live stage show. He declined offers to work in Los Angeles, including NBC&#x27;s offer of $50,000 if he accepted the move, but chose to stay in New York to &quot;kick NBC&#x27;s ass&quot;. In a press conference held in October 1985, Stern announced the signing of a five-year contract with Infinity Broadcasting worth an estimated $500,000 to host afternoons on its rock music station WXRK from November 18. WNBC agreed to let Stern out of his contract. Otherwise, the station was obliged to pay him for the remainder of his deal. Determined to beat Imus and WNBC in the ratings, Stern moved to the prime time morning slot in February 1986. The show entered syndication on August 18 that year when WYSP in Philadelphia began to simulcast the program. In the New York market, Stern had the highest-rated morning radio program between 1994 and 2001. During Stern&#x27;s twenty years at WXRK, his show was syndicated in 60 markets across North America and gained a peak audience of 20 million listeners.

Stern&#x27;s first venture into television began when the Fox network sought a replacement for &quot;The Late Show&quot;, a late-night talk show hosted by Joan Rivers. Following discussions with the network that began in late 1986, Stern agreed to five one-hour pilots that were produced for an estimated $400,000, with guitarist Leslie West as his band leader and comedian Steve Rossi as the show&#x27;s announcer. The show was subject to screen tests among focus groups in California, after which Fox decided not to pick it up. One Fox executive described the pilots as &quot;poorly produced&quot;, &quot;in poor taste&quot;, and &quot;boring&quot;. Stern went on to host his first pay-per-view event, &quot;Howard Stern&#x27;s Negligeé and Underpants Party&quot;, in February 1988. The special was purchased in 60,000 homes and grossed $1.2 million. After Stern joked about drugs being used backstage at the show, Michael Levine of the Drug Enforcement Administration complained to the &quot;Daily News&quot; which sparked media attention, though no investigation was made. In October 1989, fans sold out Nassau Coliseum in four hours for &quot;Howard Stern&#x27;s U.S. Open Sores&quot;, a live event that featured a tennis match between Stern and his producer Gary Dell&#x27;Abate following an on-air challenge. Stern released both events for home video.

In its 1990 feature on Stern, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; predicted he was &quot;on the fast track to multimedia stardom&quot;. He re-signed with Infinity Broadcasting that year to continue his radio show for five years, a deal that &quot;New York Magazine&quot; estimated was worth over $10 million. In July 1990, Stern became the host of the Saturday night variety television show &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; on WWOR-TV, starring himself and his radio show staff. Initially produced as four, one-hour specials and broadcast during the summer, the show continued to air and entered syndication in 1991 to a peak of 65 markets across the country, including cities where the radio show did not air. In the New York area, the show frequently beat &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in the ratings during the thirty minutes when the two overlapped. Stern ended the program after 69 episodes, in 1992.

By this time, the radio show had been the subject of several fines issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) over material it deemed indecent. As part of his rally against the FCC&#x27;s actions, Stern released a compilation album of censored radio segments titled &quot;Crucified by the FCC&quot; in early 1991.

Stern&#x27;s rise as a popular radio and television figure in 1992 led to the first instance of his self-proclaimed title &quot;King of All Media&quot;. This was initially a tongue-in-cheek jab at Michael Jackson, who had been dubbed &quot;King of Pop&quot;. In October 1992, Stern became the first to have the number one morning radio show in the New York and Los Angeles markets simultaneously. In the same month, Stern released &quot;Butt Bongo Fiesta&quot;, a home video containing the highlight feature of &quot;butt bongoing&quot;, an act Stern described as &quot;frenetic spanking in time to a rock record playing in the background&quot;. The video was a commercial success; approximately 260,000 copies were sold for a gross of over $10 million. In November 1992, Stern returned to Saturday night television as the host of &quot;The Howard Stern &quot;Interview&quot;&quot;, a weekly one-on-one celebrity interview series on the E! network which ended in 1993. Stern appeared at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards as Fartman, a fictional superhero originating from the humor magazine &quot;National Lampoon&quot;. Presenting an award with Luke Perry, Stern appeared on stage in the Fartman costume with his buttocks exposed. According to the trademark Stern filed for the character in October 1992, he first used Fartman at WWDC in July 1981. Development for &quot;The Adventures of Fartman&quot;, a feature film based around the character, began in late 1992 with Stern reaching a verbal agreement with New Line Cinema to release it. Screenwriter J. F. Lawton was hired to prepare an outline to a script and to direct the film with producer David Permut, and it received a budget of $8–11 million. Lawton described the film as &quot;a real comedy with a beginning, middle and an end with a strong story&quot;. In 1993, the project was abandoned due to disagreements between Stern and New Line regarding the film&#x27;s content, rating, and merchandising rights.

In November 1993, Stern was again in talks with Fox to host a late-night talk show, this time replacing Chevy Chase, whose show had been cancelled in October of that year.

===1993–1994: &quot;Private Parts&quot; and run for Governor of New York===
After &quot;The Adventures of Fartman&quot; was shelved, Buchwald started to pitch deals with book publishers as &quot;there was a perception that [Stern] had taken a hit ... we thought of the book as something that would both produce income and suggest to people that Howard had economic clout&quot;. In early 1993, Stern signed a deal with Simon &amp; Schuster worth around $1 million to write his first book, &quot;Private Parts&quot;. He spent the summer writing it with collaborator Larry &quot;Ratso&quot; Sloman and editor Judith Regan, calling the experience &quot;the most challenging thing I have ever done in my career&quot;. Upon its release on October 7, 1993, &quot;Private Parts&quot; was an immediate commercial success. The entire first print of 225,000 copies sold within hours. In five days, it became the fastest selling title in the history of Simon &amp; Schuster. Over one million copies were distributed after two weeks. &quot;Private Parts&quot; entered &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best-Seller list at number one and stayed on the list for 20 weeks. Stern held book signings across the country, with sessions lasting as long as seven hours. The first, held in New York City, was attended by an estimated ten thousand people.

In its twentieth anniversary issue in 1993, &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; named Stern &quot;the most influential air personality of the past two decades&quot;. In February 1994, Stern was featured in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine for his first of three cover stories. That year, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine added the Nationally Syndicated Air Personality of the Year category to its annual awards, based on &quot;entertainment value, creativity, and ratings success&quot;; Stern was awarded the title each year from 1994 to 2002. In late 1993, Stern urged his listeners to elect Christine Todd Whitman as Governor of New Jersey after Stern promised to support the first candidate to phone in his radio show. In March 1995, following her election success, Whitman named a highway rest stop after Stern in exchange for his endorsement on Interstate 295, south of Trenton, New Jersey. A $1,000 plaque was installed at the stop, which was stolen days later and mailed to Stern. The rest area closed in 2003 as part of budget cuts by Governor Jim McGreevey.

Stern held his second pay-per-view special, &quot;The Miss Howard Stern New Year&#x27;s Eve Pageant&quot;, on December 31, 1993. The show centered around a mock beauty pageant with celebrity judges to crown the first &quot;Miss Howard Stern&quot;. An estimated 400,000 households purchased the show for a gross of $16 million, breaking the subscriber record for a non-sports event held by a New Kids on the Block concert in 1990. The &quot;New York Post&quot; called it &quot;The most disgusting two hours in the history of television&quot;. The show was released for home video in early 1994, entitled &quot;Howard Stern&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rotten Eve 1994&quot;. It cost Stern a second television deal with Fox after network executives had disliked the content of the event and ceased discussions.
During his radio show on March 22, 1994, Stern announced his candidacy for Governor of New York under the Libertarian Party ticket, challenging Mario Cuomo for re-election. Stern planned to reinstate the death penalty, remove highway tolls to improve traffic flow and limit road work to graveyard shifts hours. Stern announced that once those three goals were accomplished, he would resign and pass the governorship to his lieutenant. At the party&#x27;s nomination convention on April 23, Stern won the required two-thirds majority on the first ballot, receiving 287 of the 381 votes cast; James Ostrowski finished second with 34 votes. To place his name on the final ballot, Stern was obliged to state his home address and complete a financial disclosure form under the Ethics in Government Act. Stern applied for an injunction as he wished to avoid stating his income; the request was denied by a judge on August 2. Stern withdrew his candidacy in an on-air press conference two days later, saying: &quot;I spend 25 hours a week telling you all the most intimate details of my life ... One fact I&#x27;ve never revealed is how much I make and how much money I have ... it&#x27;s none of your business&quot;. In the gubernatorial election on November 8, Cuomo was defeated by George Pataki, whom Stern backed. In August 1995, Pataki signed a bill that limited construction on state roads to night hours in New York City and Long Island, which was named the &quot;Howard Stern Bill&quot; in honor of Stern originally proposing the plan. Stern has since felt &quot;firmly opposed&quot; to the death penalty.

In June 1994, Stern founded the Howard Stern Production Company for &quot;original film and television production enterprises as well as joint production and development ventures&quot;. He intended to assist in a feature film adaptation of &quot;Brother Sam&quot;, the biography of comedian Sam Kinison written by his brother. In the same month, the E! network began to air weekday highlights from Stern&#x27;s radio show using cameras installed in the studio. &quot;Howard Stern&quot; ran for eleven years; the last original episode aired on July 8, 2005.

===1995–1997: &quot;Miss America&quot; and &quot;Private Parts&quot; film===
On April 3, 1995, three days after the shooting of singer Selena, Stern&#x27;s comments regarding her death and Mexican Americans caused controversy among his listeners in Texas and some Mexican American communities. Among his criticisms of her music, sound effects of gunfire were played: &quot;This music does absolutely nothing for me. Alvin and the Chipmunks have more soul ... Spanish people have the worst taste in music. They have no depth&quot;. After three days of widespread media reaction and boycott threats, Stern responded with a statement in Spanish, stressing his comments were made in satire and were not intended to hurt those who loved her. The next day, Eloy Cano, a Justice of the Peace of Harlingen, Texas, issued an arrest warrant on Stern for disorderly conduct that carried a potential maximum fine of $500 if he entered the state. Stern was never arrested on the warrant.

In 1995, Stern signed an advance deal with ReganBooks worth around $3 million to write his second book, &quot;Miss America&quot;. Stern wrote about various topics, including his cybersex experiences on the Internet service Prodigy, a private meeting with Michael Jackson, his suffering with back pain and obsessive–compulsive disorder, and his run for Governor of New York. Following its release on November 7, 1995, &quot;Miss America&quot; sold 33,000 copies at Barnes &amp; Noble stores which set a new one-day record for the chain, and 120,000 in its first week. It entered &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best-Seller list at number one and stayed on the list for 16 weeks. According to &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, 1.39 million copies were sold in 1995 alone which ranked it the year&#x27;s third best-selling book. As with &quot;Private Parts&quot;, Stern&#x27;s book signings attracted thousands. His November 30, 1995, appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; caused controversy after he appeared on the show with two bikini-clad women who kissed each other and received spanks from Stern. Leno, who urged that both acts would be edited out from the final broadcast, walked off the stage after the segment without thanking Stern.

In February 1996, production began on a biographical comedy film adaptation of &quot;Private Parts&quot; for Paramount Pictures. Development had lasted over two years as Stern, who had final script approval, &quot;rejected every script there was ... they were over the top comedies that I think were dumb, boring and dull&quot;. After producer Ivan Reitman got involved with the project, Stern agreed to a script developed by Len Blum and Michael Kalesniko. Filming began in May 1996 with director Betty Thomas and lasted four months with Stern, Quivers, and Norris acting as their younger and current selves. The crew traveled to the film set after each radio show and stayed there to shoot on weekends. Stern embarked on an extensive publicity tour to promote the film which included numerous television appearances and magazine interviews in his attempt to appeal to people who were not listeners of his radio show. &quot;Private Parts&quot; premiered on February 27, 1997, at The Theater at Madison Square Garden; outside the theatre, Stern and Rob Zombie performed &quot;The Great American Nightmare&quot;, a track they recorded for its soundtrack. The film&#x27;s wide release followed on March 7, 1997. It topped the US box office in its opening weekend with a gross of $14.6 million and earned a domestic total of $41.2 million. In 1998, Stern received a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Male Newcomer. The soundtrack, &quot;Private Parts: The Album&quot;, sold 178,000 copies in its first week of release and entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in the United States at number one in March 1997, the highest selling debut release for a soundtrack to a feature film. Three months after its release, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipping one million copies. Stern also provides vocals on &quot;Tortured Man&quot;, a track he recorded with The Dust Brothers.

In October 1997, Stern filed a $1.5 million lawsuit against Ministry of Film Inc., claiming the studio recruited him for a film called &quot;Jane&quot; starring Melanie Griffith while knowing it had insufficient funds. Stern, who remained unpaid when production ceased, accused the studio of breach of contract, fraud, and negligent representation. A settlement was reached in 1999 which resulted in Stern receiving $50,000.

===1998–2004: Television and film projects===
In April 1998, Stern announced his return to Saturday night television after he signed a deal with CBS to compete with &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on NBC and &quot;MADtv&quot; on Fox. His show, &quot;The Howard Stern Radio Show&quot;, an hour-long program that aired on mostly CBS affiliates, was formed of taped highlights from the radio show with additional material unseen from his nightly E! show, including animated segments and exclusive behind the scenes footage. Following its debut on August 22, 1998, on 79 stations nationwide, the show began to lose affiliates after two episodes as local broadcasters became concerned with the risque content. By June 1999, the number of stations carrying the show had decreased to fifty-five. After three seasons, the final show aired on November 17, 2001, to around thirty stations. Stern reflected on the endeavor: &quot;It was a weird thing. When I did the Channel 9 show we used to beat &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in New York ... I didn&#x27;t think [the CBS show] was a good idea actually because [the radio show] was already running on the E! network. It was a mistake ... they ultimately wanted what the Channel 9 show was doing&quot;.

In the first Celebrity 100 list compiled by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine in March 1999, Stern ranked at number 27 with an estimated $20 million earned that year. During the time of his CBS television show, Stern ventured into work as an executive producer through his production company for several television and film projects. In September 1999, the UPN network announced the production of &quot;Doomsday&quot;, an animated science-fiction comedy television series, for an initial thirteen episodes originally set to air in 2000. The series was described as: &quot;Set in a post-apocalyptic America nearly destroyed by a freak radiation burst, [the show] follows the travels of the Bradley family as they cross the country in an RV looking for a new place to call home&quot;. Stern was to produce the series and voice Orinthal, the family&#x27;s dog, but the show never made it to air. Stern&#x27;s most successful executive production was &quot;Son of the Beach&quot;, a television parody sitcom of &quot;Baywatch&quot; that ran from March 2000 to October 2002 on FX. The show was not renewed for a fourth season.

On December 16, 2000, Stern&#x27;s last live radio show of the year, he announced the signing of his new contract with Infinity Broadcasting to continue his show for five years after four months of negotiations. &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated his new earnings ranged between $17 million and $20 million a year. Stern spoke at The Concert for New York City in October 2001 in a hazmat suit with his buttocks exposed similarly to his 1992 MTV Music Video Awards appearance. In November 2001, Stern&#x27;s production company had begun development on a weekly television sitcom titled &quot;Kane&quot; for CBS, originally intended to replace &quot;The Howard Stern Radio Show&quot; following its cancellation, with Ron Zimmerman as the writer of its pilot episode. Its premise followed &quot;an oddball southern family and its strong-willed patriarch. The lead character&#x27;s life is altered when his previously long-lost wife returns home to him and their group of eccentric children&quot;. The project was canceled before the filming stage. In late 2002, Stern acquired the rights to the comedy films &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot; (1979) and &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; (1982) with Arclight Films. He expressed a wish to use a remake of the former as a launchpad for an unknown band. Under the deal, Stern was served as executive producer and was allowed to place &quot;Howard Stern Presents&quot; in the titles. He reasoned, &quot;If I say to ... my audience, this is &#x27;Howard Stern Presents&#x27;, it means something to them ... it&#x27;s going to be crazy. It means that it&#x27;s going to be different, and they know I&#x27;m not going to be giving them any schlock&quot;. Development for &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; came to a halt in 2011 following legal action regarding the ownership of the film&#x27;s rights.

In March 2003, Stern filed a $100-million lawsuit against ABC, Telepictures and the producers of its reality television series &quot;Are You Hot?&quot;. He claimed its premise was copied from a radio show segment of his known as The Evaluators, whereby its staff and guests evaluate the bodies of contestants. Before the show aired, Stern was in talks of producing his version of the show. A settlement was reached five months later. In early 2004, Stern spoke of talks with ABC to host an hour television interview special as part of its &quot;Primetime&quot; series, but the project never came to fruition. In August 2004, cable channel Spike ordered thirteen episodes of &quot;Howard Stern: The High School Years&quot;, an animated series set during Stern&#x27;s childhood that he was to executive produce. By late 2005, episode scripts and some test animation had been completed, but the project was soon shelved. Stern explained the series could have been produced &quot;on the cheap&quot; at $300,000 per episode, but the quality he demanded would have cost over $1 million each. Actor Michael Cera was cast as the lead voice. Stern also worked on a pilot with Robert Schimmel for The WB, based around the comedian&#x27;s real-life experience of falling in love with his daughter&#x27;s best friend following his battle with cancer, but was not picked up.

===2004–2010: Signing with Sirius and terrestrial radio departure===
The controversy surrounding the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show, aired live on February 1, 2004, led to the government&#x27;s crackdown on indecency in radio and television following a surge in audience complaints. The situation prompted tighter control over content by station managers which made Stern feel &quot;dead&quot; creatively. After Clear Channel Communications and Viacom were fined for content the FCC deemed indecent, the situation culminated on October 6, 2004, when Stern announced the signing of a five-year deal with Sirius Satellite Radio, a subscription-based satellite radio service exempt from the FCC&#x27;s broadcast regulations, starting in 2006. It was a move that has been regarded as the start of &quot;a new era of radio&quot;. Stern&#x27;s final live show on terrestrial airwaves aired on December 16, 2005.

Stern&#x27;s first contract with Sirius was worth $500 million; a budget of $100 million a year for production, staff, and programming costs. In 2005, he formed two channels, Howard 100 and Howard 101, which launched in September, and formed Howard 100 News, a team of news reporters hired to report daily stories surrounding the radio show and those associated with it. Stern ended his eleven-year association with E! and secured a deal with the iN DEMAND network to launch Howard Stern On Demand, a digital cable video-on-demand service, to broadcast uncensored tapings of the Sirius radio show. The service was relaunched as HowardTV in March 2006 and lasted until it was discontinued in December 2013. A new, state-of-the-art studio and office space were constructed for the show at Sirius&#x27; headquarters in New York City. On January 9, 2006, the day of his first broadcast on Sirius, Stern and Buchwald received a total of 34.3 million shares of Sirius stock worth $218 million for exceeding agreed subscriber number targets set when the contract was signed. A second subscriber bonus was met in January 2007, and Stern received 22 million shares of stock worth $82.9 million. In 2006, &quot;Time&quot; magazine included Stern in its &quot;Time&quot; 100 list, and he also ranked seventh on &quot;Forbes&quot;″ Celebrity 100 list in June 2006. When Sirius merged with rival service XM Satellite Radio in 2008 to form SiriusXM, the company paid Stern $25 million as per a clause in his contract. In 2006, Stern filed a trademark for the name &quot;King of All Media&quot;.

On February 28, 2006, CBS Radio, formerly Infinity Broadcasting, filed a lawsuit against Stern, Buchwald, and Sirius, claiming that Stern misused CBS broadcast time to promote Sirius for unjust enrichment during his last fourteen months on terrestrial radio. Stern held a press conference hours before the suit was filed; he stressed to the media that the suit was nothing more than a &quot;personal vendetta&quot; against him by CBS president Leslie Moonves, and a distraction to the failure of the company&#x27;s radio division in the aftermath of his departure from terrestrial radio as it struggled to attain ratings as strong as Stern&#x27;s. Suit was filed in the New York Supreme Court, and was before Judge Ira Gammerman. A settlement was reached out of court in May 2006 which involved Sirius paying CBS $2 million for the rights to Stern&#x27;s radio shows since 1985, which CBS had until then prohibited Stern from playing on Sirius.

===2010–present: Sirius contract renewals, &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, and third book===

In December 2010, Stern renewed his contract with SiriusXM to continue his radio show for a further five years. His new deal allows him to work a reduced schedule from four to three live radio shows each week. On March 22, 2011, Stern and Buchwald filed a lawsuit against SiriusXM for $300 million, claiming further annual bonuses were not paid despite Stern meeting subscriber growth targets. On April 17, 2012, Judge Barbara Kapnick disagreed with their suit and dismissed it &quot;with prejudice&quot;, thus preventing Stern and Buchwald from filing other suits over similar allegations against the company. The pair filed an appeal to the decision, but it was rejected by an appeal court.

By mid-2011, Stern had reduced his time playing chess and took up photography. Among his first shoots was taking layouts for &quot;Hamptons&quot; magazine in July. He continued to shoot throughout the year, including &quot;WHIRL&quot; magazine and the North Shore Animal League, and established his photography company Conlon Road Photography, a reference to the name of the road he lived on while growing up in Roosevelt.

Later in 2011, Stern announced his return to network television as a replacement for Piers Morgan as a judge on &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; for its seventh season. He had the show relocate to Radio City Music Hall in New York City to cater to his radio show schedule. Stern subsequently reappeared on the &quot;Forbes&quot; Celebrity 100 list at No. 26. He continued as a judge on the show for the eighth, ninth and tenth seasons. Stern left at the end of the show&#x27;s tenth season in September 2015 to devote more time to his radio show.

Stern was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2012. He has been openly critical of the organization.

In August 2013, Stern and Simon Cowell shared first place on &quot;Forbes&quot;″ list of America&#x27;s highest-paid television personalities with $95 million earned between June 2012–13. Stern and Cowell tied first place in the following year&#x27;s poll with the same amount earned from June 2013–14. In 2015, &quot;Forbes&quot; placed Stern as the world&#x27;s highest paid media personality and the fifth highest earning celebrity worldwide, at $95 million.

In February 2015, Whalerock Industries announced its partnership with Stern to set up a future direct-to-consumer digital &quot;media hub&quot; service, with a potential mix of free and subscription-based programming. On December 15, Stern announced his new deal with SiriusXM to continue his radio show for an additional five years. The agreement also gives Sirius the rights to his radio and video archives for an upcoming on-demand streaming application until 2027.

In October 2015, the Palestine Liberation Organization delegation to the US condemned Stern for remarks about Palestinian minorities in the Middle East denouncing them as a people that &quot;do not exist&quot; or &quot;did not live there [Palestine]&quot;, and earlier comments calling Arabs &quot;dogs&quot;.

In April 2018, Stern inducted Bon Jovi into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

In March 2019, Stern announced his third book for Simon and Schuster entitled &quot;Howard Stern Comes Again&quot;. It was released on May 14, 2019.

In May 2020, Stern admonished Trump supporters that listen to his SiriusXM show, saying President Trump despised his own supporters. In response to Stern&#x27;s criticisms of Trump, Donald Trump Jr. tweeted video from the &quot;Miss Howard Stern New Year&#x27;s Eve Pageant&quot; in which Stern parodied Ted Danson&#x27;s Friars Club appearance by wearing blackface and repeatedly using the N-word and other racial slurs. Stern admitted, &quot;The shit I did was fucking crazy&quot; and that he has since toned down his show, crediting years in psychotherapy for his evolution.

In December 2020, Stern renewed his contract with SiriusXM, agreeing to produce his show for five more years.

In June 2022, Stern stated his interest in running for President of the United States in 2024, if Donald Trump becomes the Republican nominee once again. In April 2024, he completed a one-on-one interview with President Joe Biden.

==FCC fines==

Between 1990 and 2004, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined owners of radio station licensees that carried &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; a total of $2.5 million for content it considered to be indecent.

Stern blamed the Bush administration for increased FCC fines and scrutiny of radio broadcasts in 2004 following the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy that February, and that year began openly promoting John Kerry&#x27;s presidential campaign and urged listeners to oust Bush.

==Personal life==

===Family and relationships===
Stern met his first wife, Alison Berns, while at Boston University through a mutual friend. He featured Berns in a student film he made about Transcendental Meditation. Stern wrote, &quot;Within a week after our relationship began, I knew I was going to marry her&quot;. They married at Temple Ohabei Shalom in Brookline, Massachusetts, on June 4, 1978; both were 24 years old. They have three daughters: Emily Beth (b. 1983), Debra Jennifer (b. 1986), and Ashley Jade (b. 1993). In October 1999, they decided to separate. Stern said, &quot;I was totally neurotic and sort of consumed with work. I took work as the most important thing and the only thing&quot;. He moved from the home he shared with Berns in Old Westbury, New York into a 4,000-square-foot apartment in Millennium Tower in the Upper West Side of Manhattan which he bought in 1998 for $4.9 million. The marriage ended in 2001 with an amicable divorce and settlement. Stern has since bought a home in Southampton, New York on Long Island.

In the several months when Stern was single, he dated Angie Everhart and Robin Givens. He started seeing a psychotherapist. In 2000, he started to date model and television host Beth Ostrosky. He announced their engagement on his radio show on February 14, 2007. They married at Le Cirque restaurant in New York City on October 3, 2008. The ceremony was officiated by Mark Consuelos. In 2017, Stern purchased a home in Palm Beach, Florida, for $52 million.
===Other activities===

In the early 1970s, Stern&#x27;s parents began to practice Transcendental Meditation and encouraged him to learn. Stern credits the technique with helping him quit smoking, achieve his goals in radio, beat obsessive–compulsive disorder, and cure his mother of depression. As of 1997, he continued to practice it. Stern has interviewed Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of the technique, and thanked him for relieving his mother&#x27;s depression.

Stern revealed his suffering with obsessive–compulsive disorder in &quot;Miss America&quot;. His condition originated while at university and continued into his radio career. As part of the Staff Revelations Game on his radio show in January 2006, Stern revealed that he had undergone rhinoplasty and had liposuction under his chin in the 1990s.
In 2012, Stern said he had adopted a pescetarian diet. In 2019, Stern revealed that he had a cancer scare two years prior, after a growth was found on one of his kidneys. It turned out to be a benign cyst.

Stern is a longtime supporter and fund raiser for North Shore Animal League America. Stern and Ostrosky have been fostering cats in their Long Island home since 2014. Approximately 200 cats come through their home every year.

<text>Burns and Allen were an American comedy duo consisting of George Burns and his wife, Gracie Allen. They worked together as a successful comedy team that entertained vaudeville, film, radio, and television audiences for over forty years.

The duo met in 1922 and married in 1926. Burns played the straight man and Allen played a silly, addle-headed woman whose convoluted logic Burns was often ill-equipped to challenge. The duo starred in a number of films, including &quot;Lambchops&quot; (1929), &quot;The Big Broadcast&quot; (1932) and two sequels in 1935 and 1936, and &quot;A Damsel in Distress&quot; (1937). Their 30-minute radio show debuted in September 1934 as &quot;The Adventures of Gracie&quot;, whose title changed to &quot;The Burns and Allen Show&quot; in 1936; the series ran, moving back and forth between NBC and CBS, until May 1950. After their radio show&#x27;s cancellation, Burns and Allen reemerged on television with a popular situation comedy, which ran from 1950 to 1958.

Burns and Allen&#x27;s radio show was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1994. Their TV series received a total of 11 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, and produced what &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked No. 56 on its 1997 list of the 100 greatest episodes of all time. They were inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1988.

==Vaudeville==

Burns and Allen met in 1922 and first performed together at the Hill Street Theatre in Newark, New Jersey, continued in small town vaudeville theaters, married in Cleveland on January 7, 1926, and moved up a notch when they signed with the Keith-Albee-Orpheum circuit in 1927.

Burns wrote most of the material and played the straight man. Allen played a silly, addle-headed woman, a role often attributed to the &quot;Dumb Dora&quot; stereotype common in early 20th-century vaudeville comedy. Early on, the team had played the opposite roles until they noticed that the audience was laughing at Gracie&#x27;s straight lines, so they made the change. In later years, each attributed their success to the other.

The Burns and Allen team was not an overnight sensation. &quot;We were a good man-and-woman act,&quot; Burns said, &quot;but we were not headliners or stars or featured attractions. We were on the bill with them. There would be a star or two stars and a featured attraction, and then we would come—fourth billing in an eight-act show.&quot; Their career changed direction when they made their first film.

==Motion pictures==
In the early days of talking pictures, the studios eagerly hired actors who knew how to deliver dialogue or songs. The most prolific of these studios was Warner Bros., whose Vitaphone Varieties shorts captured vaudeville headliners of the 1920s on film.

Burns and Allen earned a reputation as a reliable &quot;disappointment act&quot; (someone who could fill in for a sick or otherwise absent performer on a moment&#x27;s notice). So it went with their film debut. They were last-minute replacements for another act (Fred Allen) and ran through their patter-and-song routine in &quot;Lambchops&quot; (1929). After a restoration, the film was released on DVD in October 2007, on disc three of a three-disc 80th anniversary edition of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;.

Paramount Pictures used its East Coast studio to film New York-based stage and vaudeville stars. Eddie Cantor, Fred Allen, Ethel Merman and Smith and Dale were among the top acts seen in Paramount shorts. Burns and Allen joined the Paramount roster in 1930 and made a string of one-reel comedies through 1933, usually written by Burns and featuring future Hollywood character actors such as Barton MacLane and Chester Clute.

In 1932, Paramount produced an all-star musical comedy, &quot;The Big Broadcast&quot;, featuring the nation&#x27;s hottest radio personalities. Burns and Allen were recruited, and made such an impression that they continued to make guest appearances in Paramount features through 1937. Most of these used the &quot;Big Broadcast&quot; formula of an all-star comedy cast. In 1935 the team also starred in a pair of low-budget features, &quot;Here Comes Cookie&quot; and &quot;Love in Bloom&quot;.

At RKO, Fred Astaire succeeded in his efforts to make a musical feature without Ginger Rogers, and the studio borrowed Burns and Allen from Paramount for the 1937 film, &quot;A Damsel in Distress&quot;. Their names appeared with Astaire&#x27;s before the title. Under contract to RKO, the young Joan Fontaine was assigned as Astaire&#x27;s romantic interest, but when she proved to be an inadequate dance partner Astaire did most of his dancing with Burns and Allen. The trio&#x27;s comic dance in the film&#x27;s &quot;Fun House&quot; sequence earned an Academy Award for choreographer Hermes Pan. Burns suggested a dance number that employs whiskbrooms as props, used in vaudeville by a duo called Evans and Evans. He bought the idea and auditioned the routine for Astaire, with Allen and the surviving member of the vaudeville team.

This movie led Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to cast Burns and Allen in its Eleanor Powell musical, &quot;Honolulu&quot; (1939). This was their last film as a team; Gracie made two subsequent film appearances on her own, but Burns and Allen did not return to the cameras until their television series in 1950.

When Burns was 79, he had a sudden career revival as an amiable, beloved and unusually active comedic elder statesman in the 1975 film &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot;, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. In 1977, his starring role in &quot;Oh, God!&quot;, along with the former film, permanently secured his career resurgence. At the age of 80, Burns was the oldest Oscar winner in the history of the Academy Awards, a record that would remain until Jessica Tandy won an Oscar for &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; in 1989. Burns, who became a centenarian in 1996, continued to work until just weeks before his death of cardiac arrest on March 19, 1996, at his home in Beverly Hills.

===Filmography===
==Radio==

In 1929 Burns and Allen made their debut radio performance broadcast in London on the BBC. In the United States, they failed at a 1930 NBC audition. After a solo appearance by Gracie on Eddie Cantor&#x27;s radio show, they were heard together on Rudy Vallée&#x27;s &quot;The Fleischmann&#x27;s Yeast Hour&quot; and on February 15, 1932, they became regulars on &quot;The Guy Lombardo Show&quot; on CBS. When Lombardo switched to NBC, Burns and Allen took over his CBS spot with &quot;The Adventures of Gracie&quot; beginning September 19, 1934.

Along the way, the duo launched the temporary running gag that made them near-irrevocable radio stars: the famous hunt for Gracie&#x27;s &quot;lost brother,&quot; which began on January 4, 1933 and eventually became a cross-network phenomenon. Gracie was also liable to turn up on other shows (especially those produced by the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, which produced the Burns &amp; Allen series) looking for her brother. Bad publicity after a bid by NBC to squelch the stunt—and an accidental mention by Rudy Vallée on his &quot;Fleischmann&#x27;s Hour&quot;—helped the stunt continue, according to radio historian John Dunning&#x27;s &quot;On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio&quot;, which also mentioned that Gracie&#x27;s real brother, a &quot;publicity-shy accountant&quot; living in San Francisco, went into hiding until the gag ran its course.

Burns and Allen followed this with another stunt: &quot;Gracie Allen for President.&quot; During the election year of 1940, Gracie represented the fictitious Surprise Party and advocated nonsense as part of her platform. The &quot;campaign&quot; was successful enough for Gracie to actually receive write-in votes on election day.

The title of their top-rated show changed to &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot; on September 26, 1936. One successful episode, &quot;Grandpa&#x27;s 92nd Birthday,&quot; aired July 8, 1940. In 1941 they moved from comedy patter into a successful sitcom format, continuing with shows on NBC and CBS until May 17, 1950. As in the early days of radio, the sponsor&#x27;s name became the show title, such as &quot;Maxwell House Coffee Time&quot; (1945–49).

The show featured several regulars on radio, including Toby Reed, Gale Gordon, Bea Benaderet, Mel Blanc, Gracie&#x27;s real-life friend Mary &quot;Bubbles&quot; Kelly, Ray Noble, singers Jimmy Cash and Tony Martin and actor/writer/director Elliott Lewis. The Sportsmen Quartet (appearing as &quot;The Swantet&quot; during the years the show was sponsored by Swan Soap) supplied songs and occasionally backed up Cash. Meredith Willson, Artie Shaw and announcers Bill Goodwin and Harry Von Zell were usually made a part of the evening&#x27;s doings, often as additional comic foils for the duo.

For a long time they continued their &quot;flirtation act&quot; with Burns as Allen&#x27;s most persistent suitor. Their real-life marriage was not written into the show until 1941, when Burns noticed that their ratings were slowly but steadily slipping. He realized that he and Gracie &quot;were too old for our jokes,&quot; and revised the format to include husband-and-wife characters in a situation-comedy setting. Burns&#x27; assessment was correct, and the Burns and Allen program went on to achieve new heights.

Recordings of 176 episodes of the radio shows circulate on the web, CDs and DVDs—including all installments of the &quot;Gracie for President&quot; routine and some of the &quot;lost brother&quot; episodes.

===Broadcast history===
===Accolades===
&quot;The Burns and Allen Show&quot; was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1994.

==Television==


In 1950, Burns and Allen transitioned to television with &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot;. An immediate success, the half-hour situation comedy was broadcast October 12, 1950 – September 22, 1958, on CBS. The show was initially staged live in New York and presented every other week. In the fall of 1952 it became a weekly series filmed on the West Coast. With 291 episodes, the show had a long network run through 1958 and continued in syndicated reruns for years.

The sets were designed to look like the couple&#x27;s real-life residence. An establishing shot of the actual house on Maple Drive in Beverly Hills, California, was often used. Although extensively remodeled, that house still exists today—including the study over the garage where George would &quot;escape&quot; from Gracie&#x27;s illogical logic. Burns lived in the house until his death in 1996, at the age of 100.

The format had George watching all the action (standing outside the proscenium arch in early live episodes; watching the show on TV in his study towards the end of the series) and breaking the fourth wall by commenting upon it to the viewers.

During the course of the eight-year run, the TV show had remarkable consistency in its cast and crew. The episodes were produced and directed by Ralph Levy (1950–53); Frederick de Cordova, later director of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; (1953–56); and Rod Amateau (1956–58). The original writing staff consisted of Sid Dorfman, Harvey Helm, Paul Henning and William Burns (George&#x27;s brother). The TV show was produced under the banner of McCadden Productions, a company run by George Burns which he named after the street on which his brother, William, lived. The McCadden catalog is owned by Sony Pictures Television.

Bea Benaderet carried over from the radio show, portraying neighbor Blanche Morton. Her husband Harry Morton was first portrayed by Hal March (October–December 1950), and then by John Brown (January–June 1951), and after that, Fred Clark, until 1953 when the role was assumed by Larry Keating.

Also appearing in the TV series were Burns and Allen&#x27;s two adopted children, Ronnie and Sandra. Ronnie became a near-regular on the show, playing himself but cast as a young drama student who tended to look askance at his parents&#x27; comedy style. Sandra declined becoming a regular member of the cast, although she appeared in a few episodes, usually as a secretary or the voice of a telephone operator.

In March 1953, &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot; joined &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; as part of the CBS Monday night prime-time lineup. As a result, the show entered the top 30 television programs in the Nielsen ratings ranking at No. 20. For the 1954–1955 season, it ranked No. 26, and for both the 1955–56 and 1956–57 seasons it was No. 28. With &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; ending its six-year run on CBS in the spring of 1957, the television network wanted to renew the Burns and Allen series, but by this time Allen had grown tired of the grind. Nevertheless, Burns committed both of them for another year, which would be their eighth—and last—on television.

Allen announced her retirement on February 17, 1958, effective at the end of the current season.

Burns and Allen filmed their last show June 4, 1958. The filming was an emotional experience, although nothing was said about it being Allen&#x27;s last performance. At the wrap party, Allen took a token sip of champagne from a paper cup, hugged her friend and co-star Bea Benaderet, and said &quot;Okay, that&#x27;s it.&quot; After one last look around the set, she said, &quot;And thank you very much, everyone.&quot;

&quot;She deserved a rest,&quot; Burns said when Allen devoted herself to gardening and being a housewife:

She had been working all her life, and her lines were the toughest in the world to do. They didn&#x27;t make sense, so she had to memorize every word. It took a real actress. Every spare moment—in bed, under the hair dryer—had to be spent in learning lines. Do you wonder that she&#x27;s happy to be rid of it?

Burns attempted to continue the show with the same supporting cast but without Allen. &quot;The George Burns Show&quot; lasted one season (October 21, 1958 – April 14, 1959) on NBC.

Following a mild heart attack in the 1950s, Gracie Allen suffered a series of angina episodes over a number of years. She had a major heart attack in 1961. She lived a slower but comfortable retirement for another three years, often appearing in public with her husband but never performing. Gracie Allen died August 27, 1964.

===Accolades===
&quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot; received a total of 11 Primetime Emmy Award nominations.

In 1997, the 1954 episode, &quot;Columbia Pictures Doing Burns and Allen Story&quot;, was ranked No. 56 on TV Guide&#x27;s 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time.

===McCadden Productions===
&quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot; was produced under the banner of McCadden Productions, a company run by George Burns which he named after the street on which his brother William lived. While the series was in production Burns began producing other television shows and commercials. McCadden Productions employed more than 300 people and produced series including &quot;Mister Ed&quot;, &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot;, &quot;The People&#x27;s Choice&quot;, &quot;The Marie Wilson Show&quot; and &quot;Panic!&quot;.

&quot;Television was still so new that nobody really knew what kinds of shows the audience would watch,&quot; Burns wrote, &quot;but I figured that people would like the same things on television that they liked in vaudeville, so we did shows with pretty girls and animals.&quot;

==Legacy==
Known for his philanthropy, George Burns made numerous contributions to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. The hospital is located at the intersection of George Burns Road, dedicated in 1986, and Gracie Allen Drive, dedicated in 1995. The George Burns–Gracie Allen Chair in Cardiology was established in 1989. The Burns and Allen Research Institute was dedicated in 1996, on Burns&#x27; 100th birthday.

<text>The Lone Ranger is a fictional masked former Texas Ranger who fought outlaws in the American Old West with his Native American friend Tonto. The character has been called an enduring icon of American culture.

He first appeared in 1933 in a radio show on WXYZ (Detroit), conceived either by station owner George W. Trendle or by Fran Striker, the show&#x27;s writer. Test episodes aired earlier on radio station WEBR in Buffalo. The radio series proved to be a hit, and spawned a series of books (largely written by Striker), an equally popular television show that ran from 1949 to 1957, comic books, and several films.

The title character was played on the radio show by Earle Graser for some 1,300 episodes, but two others preceded him, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;a man named Deeds, who lasted only a few weeks; a George Stenius [actually George Seaton according to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;]. After Graser died in 1941, Brace Beemer assumed the role after serving as the program&#x27;s narrator. On the radio, Tonto was played by John Todd and Roland Parker, among others.

Clayton Moore portrayed the Lone Ranger on television, although during a contract dispute, Moore was replaced for a season by John Hart. Jay Silverheels, a Mohawk from the Six Nations Indian Reserve in Ontario, Canada, was cast as Tonto.

==Origin==
While details differ, the basic story of the Lone Ranger&#x27;s origin is consistent in most versions of the franchise. The Lone Ranger is the sole survivor of a group of six ambushed Texas Rangers. A posse of six members of the Texas Ranger Division, led by Captain Dan Reid, pursue a band of outlaws led by Bartholomew &quot;Butch&quot; Cavendish but are betrayed by a civilian guide who was secretly working with Cavendish, and who led the unsuspecting rangers into an ambush at a canyon known as Bryant&#x27;s Gap.

Later, a Native American named Tonto stumbles onto the grisly scene. He discovers one of the rangers, Captain Reid&#x27;s younger brother John, barely alive, and he nurses the man to health. In some versions, Tonto recognizes the lone survivor as the man who had saved his life when they both were children. According to the television series, Tonto gave Reid a ring and the name Kemo Sabe, which he said means &quot;trusty scout&quot;. John Reid then tells Tonto that he intends to hunt down Cavendish and his men and to bring them to justice. To conceal his identity and honor his fallen brother, Reid fashions a black domino mask using cloth from his late brother&#x27;s vest. To aid in the deception, Tonto digs a sixth grave and places at its head a cross-bearing John Reid&#x27;s name so that Cavendish and his gang will believe that all the Rangers have been killed.

In many versions, Reid continues fighting for justice as the Lone Ranger even after the Cavendish gang is captured.

==Characters==

===The Lone Ranger===
As generally depicted, the Lone Ranger conducts himself by a strict Moral Code based on that put in place by Striker at the inception of the character. It read:
&lt;poem&gt;
I believe that to have a friend,
a man must be one.

That all men are created equal
and that everyone has within himself
the power to make this a better world.

That God put the firewood there
but that every man
must gather and light it himself.

In being prepared
physically, mentally, and morally
to fight when necessary
for what is right.

That a man should make the most
of what equipment he has.

That &#x27;this government,
of the people, by the people
and for the people&#x27;
shall live always.

That men should live by
the rule of what is best
for the greatest number.

That sooner or later...
somewhere...somehow...
we must settle with the world
and make payment for what we have taken.

That all things change but truth,
and that truth alone, lives on forever.

In my Creator, my country, my fellow man.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In addition, Fran Striker and George W. Trendle drew up the following guidelines that embody who and what the Lone Ranger is:
* The Lone Ranger was never seen without his mask or some sort of disguise.
* He was never captured or held for any length of time by lawmen, avoiding his being unmasked.
* He always used perfect grammar and precise speech devoid of slang and colloquialisms.
* Whenever he was forced to use guns, he never shot to kill, but instead tried to disarm his opponent as painlessly as possible.
* He was never put in a hopeless situation; e.g., he was never seen escaping from a barrage of gunfire merely by fleeing toward the horizon.
* He rarely referred to himself as the Lone Ranger. If someone&#x27;s suspicions were aroused, either the Lone Ranger would present one of his silver bullets to confirm his identity or someone else would attest on his behalf; the latter happened at the end of most episodes when someone would ask, &quot;Who &quot;was&quot; that masked man?&quot; as the Lone Ranger departed. His decision to adopt the moniker of Lone Ranger was inspired by Tonto; following the ambush at Bryant&#x27;s Gap, Tonto observed him to be the only ranger left—in other words, he was the &quot;lone&quot; ranger.
* Though the Lone Ranger offered his aid to individuals or small groups facing powerful adversaries, the ultimate objective of his story always implied that their benefit was only a byproduct of the development of the West or the country.
* Adversaries were rarely other than American, to avoid criticism from minority groups, with some exceptions. He sometimes battled foreign agents, though their nation of origin was generally not named. An exception was his having helped the Mexican Benito Juárez against French troops of Emperor Maximilian, as occurred in the radio episodes &quot;Supplies for Juarez&quot; (September 18, 1939), &quot;Hunted by Legionnaires&quot; (September 20, 1939), and &quot;Lafitte&#x27;s Reinforcements&quot; (September 22, 1939).
* The names of unsympathetic characters were carefully chosen so that they never consisted of two names if it could be avoided. More often than not, a single nickname or surname was selected.
* The Lone Ranger never drank or smoked, and saloon scenes were usually shown as cafes, with waiters and food instead of bartenders and liquor.
* Criminals were never shown in enviable positions of wealth or power, and they were never successful or glamorous.

====The Lone Ranger&#x27;s first name====
Although the Lone Ranger&#x27;s last name in the radio shows was given as Reid, his first name was never specified in any of the radio or television shows. Various radio reference books, beginning with &quot;Radio&#x27;s Golden Age&quot; (Eastern Valley Press, 1966), give the Lone Ranger&#x27;s first name as John. Some cite the 20th-anniversary radio program in 1953 as the source of the name, but the Lone Ranger&#x27;s first name is never mentioned in that episode.

In the final chapter of the 1938 Republic &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; movie serial, he is revealed to be Texas Ranger Allen King. In the second serial, &quot;The Lone Ranger Rides Again&quot;, he identifies himself as Bill Andrews.

The Lone Ranger&#x27;s first name is also thought to have not been mentioned in contemporary Lone Ranger newspaper comics, comic books, and tie-in premiums, though some have stated that the name John Reid was used in an illustration of the grave marker made by Tonto, which appeared in either a comic-book version of the character&#x27;s origin story or in a children&#x27;s record set.

The name John Reid is used in the 1981 film &quot;The Legend of the Lone Ranger&quot;. The Lone Ranger is also John Reid in Dynamite Entertainment&#x27;s licensed Lone Ranger comic-book series that began in 2006, and in the 2013 Disney film &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;.

The name Luke Hartman was used in the 2003 TV-movie/unsold series pilot.

===Tonto===
The character made his initial appearance in the 11th episode of the radio show. Fran Striker told his son that Tonto was added so the Lone Ranger would have someone to talk to. He was named by James Jewell, who also came up with the term &quot;Kemosabe&quot; based on the name of a summer camp owned by his father-in-law in upstate Michigan. In the local Native American language, &quot;Tonto&quot; meant &quot;wild one&quot;.

The character spoke in broken English that emphasized Tonto had learned it as a second language.

Because means &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;ignorant&quot; in Spanish, the character is renamed &quot;&quot; (Spanish for &quot;bull&quot;) or &quot;&quot; in Spanish-speaking countries.

===Dan Reid Jr.===
Dan Reid was introduced on the radio series in 1942 as a juvenile sidekick to the Masked Man; the character is Captain Reid&#x27;s son, and the Lone Ranger&#x27;s nephew. When Trendle and Striker later created &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; in 1936, they made this Dan Reid the father of Britt Reid, alias the Green Hornet, thereby making the Lone Ranger the Green Hornet&#x27;s great-uncle. In &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; radio series, Dan was played by Ernest Winstanley, Bob Martin, Clarence Weitzel, James Lipton, and Dick Beals.

The Lone Ranger&#x27;s nephew made his first appearance in &quot;Heading North&quot; (December 14, 1942) under the name Dan Frisby, the grandson of Grandma Frisby. The two lived in an area described as &quot;the high border country of the northwest&quot; near the town of Martinsville close to the Canada–US border. This and the following four episodes (&quot;Design for Murder&quot;, December 16, 1942; &quot;Rope&#x27;s End&quot;, December 18, 1942; &quot;Law of the Apex&quot;, December 21, 1942; and &quot;Dan&#x27;s Strange Behavior&quot;, December 23, 1942) centered on a plot to steal the valuable Martin Copper Mine and Dan&#x27;s being fooled by a Lone Ranger impostor into helping him steal it. The Lone Ranger and the Mounties foil the plot and capture the impostor and his gang.

In the final episode of the arc, &quot;A Nephew Is Found&quot; (December 25, 1942), dying Grandma Frisby reveals to the Lone Ranger Dan&#x27;s true identity and how he came to be with her. Fifteen years previously, Grandma Frisby had been part of a wagon train travelling to Fort Laramie. Also on that wagon train had been Linda Reid, wife of Texas Ranger Captain Dan Reid, and her six-month-old son, Dan Jr., who were travelling from their home in Virginia to join her husband. Before the wagon train could reach Fort Laramie, Indians attacked it and Linda Reid was among those killed. Grandma Frisby took charge and care of Dan Jr., but upon reaching Fort Laramie, found two messages waiting, one that Captain Reid (voiced in this story by Al Hodge) had been killed in an ambush at Bryant&#x27;s Gap and the other that her own husband had been killed in an explosion. Taking Dan and certain items concerning his identity (including a small gold locket containing a picture of Dan&#x27;s parents and a picture of Captain Reid&#x27;s brother), Grandma Frisby travelled to Martinsville and raised Dan as her grandson.

On hearing this story, the Lone Ranger reveals his true identity and his own story to Grandma Frisby, and promises that he will care for Dan like his own son. Before Grandma Frisby dies, the Lone Ranger removes his mask and lets her see his face. Her last words are, &quot;Ride on, Lone Ranger ... ride on forever ... with Danny at your side.&quot; The Lone Ranger takes the grieving Dan outside the cabin, gives him the locket, and reveals their true relationship. Dan Reid Jr. went on to be a recurring character throughout the remainder of the series, riding with the Lone Ranger and Tonto on his own horse Victor.

Eventually, Dan Reid Jr. was sent East to gain an education, making infrequent appearances on the series whenever Fran Striker wanted to remind the audience of the family connection, and later became part of &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; radio series, first appearing on October 22, 1936, establishing the connection between the Lone Ranger and the Green Hornet in the episode &quot;Too Hot to Handle&quot; (November 11, 1947) and being played throughout the series by John Todd, who played Tonto on &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; radio series.

===Their horses===
According to the episode &quot;The Legend of Silver&quot; (September 30, 1938), before acquiring Silver, the Lone Ranger rode a chestnut mare called Dusty. The Lone Ranger saves Silver&#x27;s life from an enraged buffalo, and in gratitude, Silver chooses to give up his wild life to carry him.

The origin of Tonto&#x27;s horse, Scout, is less clear. For a long time, Tonto rides a white horse called White Feller. In &quot;Four Day Ride&quot; (August 5, 1938), Tonto is given a paint horse by his friend Chief Thundercloud, who then takes White Feller. Tonto rides this horse and refers to him simply as &quot;Paint Horse&quot; for several episodes. The horse is finally named Scout in &quot;Border Dope Smuggling&quot; (September 2, 1938). In another episode, however, the Lone Ranger, in a surge of conscience, releases Silver back to the wild. The episode ends with Silver returning, bringing along a companion that becomes Tonto&#x27;s horse Scout.

In an echo of the Lone Ranger&#x27;s line, Tonto frequently says, &quot;Git-um up, Scout!&quot; (The phrase became so well embedded in the Lone Ranger mythos that International Harvester used it as an advertising line to promote their Scout utility vehicle in the 1970s.) In the Format Films animated cartoon, which ran from 1966 to 1968, Tonto also had an eagle he called Taka, and installments that focused exclusively on him or had him team up with the Lone Ranger ended with his saying, &quot;Fly, Taka! On, Scout!&quot; (Those where he teamed with the Lone Ranger had the Ranger following this up with the customary &quot;Hi-yo, Silver! Away!&quot;)

==Original radio series==
The creators of the character were George Trendle (manager of WXYZ radio station) and writer Fran Striker.

The first of 2,956 radio episodes of &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; premiered on WXYZ, a radio station serving Detroit, Michigan, on January 31, 1933. As Dunning writes in &quot;On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio:&quot;

&quot;There may have been a few late-night on-air shakedown shows prior to the official January 31, 1933, premiere date. Lacking concrete evidence, [&quot;Lone Ranger&quot; authority Terry] Salomonson is inclined to doubt it. &quot;There is nothing in any of the Detroit papers to indicate this, but that in itself doesn&#x27;t mean much. The papers didn&#x27;t even list the show in their radio logs at first.&quot;

The show was an immediate success. Though it was aimed at children, adults made up at least half the audience. It became so popular, it was picked up by the Mutual Broadcasting System and, on May 2, 1942, by NBC&#x27;s Blue Network, which in time became ABC.

By 1939, some 20 million Americans were listening to the program. It also had numerous listeners in other countries.

===Introductions===
An announcer introduced each episode with the following, which was sometimes changed to reflect the storyline of the episode:

In the early days of the western United States, a masked man and an Indian rode the plains, searching for truth and justice. Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear, when from out of the past come the thundering hoofbeats of the great horse Silver! The Lone Ranger rides again!

By the time it was on ABC at 7:30 pm Eastern, the introduction, voiced by Fred Foy, had become &quot;Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear&quot;, followed by, &quot;From out of the west with the speed of light and a hearty &#x27;Hi-yo, Silver! The intro was later changed to:

A fiery horse with the speed of light, a cloud of dust and a hearty Hi-Yo Silver! The Lone Ranger! ... With his faithful Indian companion Tonto, the daring and resourceful masked rider of the plains led the fight for law and order in the early western United States! Nowhere in the pages of history can one find a greater champion of justice! Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear! From out of the past come the thundering hoofbeats of the great horse Silver! The Lone Ranger rides again!

This was followed by Brace Beemer&#x27;s voice, declaring, &quot;Come on, Silver! Let&#x27;s go, big fellow! Hi-yo, Silver! Away!&quot;

===Cast===
The Lone Ranger was played by several actors:
* John L. Barrett, on test broadcasts on WEBR in January 1933;
* George Seaton (under the name George Stenius) (January 31 – May 9, 1933);
* Series director James Jewell, for one episode;
* An actor known only by the pseudonym &quot;Jack Deeds&quot;, for one episode;
* Earle Graser (May 16, 1933 – April 7, 1941). On April 8, Graser died in a car accident; and, for five episodes, the Lone Ranger was unable to speak beyond a whisper, with Tonto carrying the action. In addition, six episodes broadcast in August 1938 did not include the Lone Ranger&#x27;s voice other than an occasional &quot;Hi-Yo Silver!&quot; in the background. In those episodes, Tonto carried the dialog;
* Brace Beemer (April 18, 1941, to the end), who had been the show&#x27;s deep-voiced announcer for several years;
* Fred Foy (March 29, 1954), also an announcer on the show, took over the role for one broadcast when Beemer had laryngitis.

Tonto was played throughout the run by actor John Todd (although in a few isolated occasions, he was replaced by Roland Parker, better known as Kato for much of the run of sister series &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;). Other supporting players were selected from Detroit area actors and studio staff. These included Jay Michael (who also played the lead on &quot;Challenge of the Yukon&quot;, or &quot;Sgt. Preston of the Yukon&quot;), Bill Saunders (as various villains, including Butch Cavendish), Paul Hughes (as the Ranger&#x27;s friend Thunder Martin and as various army colonels and badmen), future movie star John Hodiak, Janka Fasciszewska (under the name Jane Fae), and Rube Weiss and Liz Weiss (later a married couple, both actors in several radio and television programs in Detroit, Rube usually taking on villain roles on the &quot;Ranger&quot;, and Liz playing damsels in distress). The part of nephew Dan Reid was played by various child actors, including Bob Martin, James Lipton, and Dick Beals.

===Music===
The theme music was primarily taken from the &quot;March of the Swiss Soldiers&quot; finale of Gioachino Rossini&#x27;s &quot;William Tell&quot; Overture, which thus came to be inseparably associated with the series. The theme was conducted by Daniel Pérez Castañeda, with the softer parts excerpted from &quot;Die Moldau&quot;, composed by Bedřich Smetana.

Many other classical selections were used as incidental music, including Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Flying Dutchman Overture&quot;, Bizet&#x27;s Symphony in C, Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Fingal&#x27;s Cave&quot; Overture, Emil von Řezníček&#x27;s &quot;Donna Diana&quot; Overture, Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Les préludes&quot;, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;1812&quot; Overture and music by Schubert. Classical music was originally used because it was in the public domain, thus allowing production costs to be kept low while providing a wide range of music as needed without the cost of a composer.

In the late 1930s, Trendle acquired the rights to use incidental music from Republic Pictures motion picture serials as part of a deal for Republic to produce a serial based (loosely) on the Lone Ranger. This music was then modified by NBC radio arranger Ben Bonnell and recorded in Mexico to avoid American union rules. This music was used in both the radio and later television shows.

===&quot;The Green Hornet&quot;===

The radio series inspired a spinoff called &quot;The Green Hornet,&quot; which depicts the son of the Lone Ranger&#x27;s nephew Dan, Britt Reid, originally played by Al Hodge, who in contemporary times, fights crime with a similar secret identity and a sidekick, Kato. One major difference between the two characters is that everyone considers the Green Hornet to be a bad guy. Reid embraces this persona, thus enabling him to infiltrate real crime syndicates, while secretly aiding the police.

Rights to The Lone Ranger and The Green Hornet have been acquired by separate owners and the familial link has been ignored in the Western character&#x27;s various incarnations. The Lone Ranger – Green Hornet connection is part of Philip José Farmer&#x27;s Wold Newton Universe, which connects disparate fictional characters.

===Hi-Yo Silver!, Kemo sabe, and other cultural tropes===

At the beginning of each episode, the magnificent white stallion, Silver, would rear up with the Lone Ranger on his back, then they would dash off, the Ranger encouragingly shouting, &quot;Hi-Yo, Silver!&quot; Tonto could occasionally be heard to urge on his mount by calling out, &quot;Get-um up, Scout!&quot; At the end of each episode, mission completed, one of the characters would always ask the sheriff or other authority, &quot;Who was that masked man?&quot; When it was explained, &quot;Oh, he&#x27;s the Lone Ranger!&quot;, the Ranger and Tonto would be seen galloping off with the cry, &quot;Hi-Yo, Silver! Away!&quot; catching the attention of one of the townspeople crossing the street.

Tonto usually referred to the Lone Ranger as &quot;Kemo sabe&quot;, described as meaning either &quot;faithful friend,&quot; or &quot;trusty scout&quot;. It is more likely the word derives from the Anishinaabe language. Gimoozaabi is said to mean &quot;he looks out in secret.&quot; These catchphrases, the Ranger&#x27;s trademark silver bullets, and the theme music from the &quot;William Tell&quot; Overture have become tropes of popular culture.

==Film serials==
Republic Pictures released two serials starring the Lone Ranger. The first, released in 1938, used several actors playing different Texas Rangers, one of whom was also the masked hero, like Don Diego de la Vega was also Zorro. Unlike Vega/Zorro, however, the Lone Ranger&#x27;s true identity remained unknown to the audience until the conclusion. The character played by Lee Powell is ultimately revealed to be the Lone Ranger.

The second serial, &quot;The Lone Ranger Rides Again&quot;, was released in 1939 and starred Robert Livingston.

Tonto was played in both by Victor Daniels, billed under his usual stage name, Chief Thundercloud.

A feature version of the first serial, with added footage, was released by Republic in 1940 as &quot;Hi-Yo Silver&quot;.

==Television==

===&quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; (1949–1957)===
&quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; is a TV show that aired for eight seasons, from 1949 to 1957, and starred Clayton Moore as the Lone Ranger and Jay Silverheels as Tonto. Only five of the eight seasons had new episodes. It was the ABC television network&#x27;s first big hit of the early 1950s. Moore&#x27;s tenure as the Ranger is probably the best-known treatment of the franchise. Moore was replaced in the third season by John Hart, but he returned for the final two seasons. The final season was shot in color. A total of 221 episodes were made.

After the series ended, Moore continued to make public appearances as the Lone Ranger. In 1979, Jack Wrather, then owner of the rights to the character, obtained a restraining order against Moore, enjoining Moore from appearing in public in his mask. The actor began wearing oversized wraparound Foster Grant sunglasses, as a substitute for the mask. Moore later won a countersuit, allowing him to resume his costume.

===&quot;The Return of the Lone Ranger&quot; (1961)===
In 1961 CBS produced &quot;Return of the Lone Ranger&quot;, starring Tex Hill, as the pilot episode for a proposed TV series.

===Format Films animated cartoon, 1966 to 1968===
An animated series of &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; ran from 1966 to 1968 on CBS. It was produced by Herbert Klynn and Jules Engel of Format Films, Hollywood, and designed and animated at the Halas and Batchelor Cartoon Film studios in London, England. The show lasted thirty episodes; however, these were invariably split into three separate shorts, with the middle segment being a solo adventure for Tonto, so that there were actually 90 installments in all. The last episode aired on March 9, 1968.

These Lone Ranger adventures were similar in tone and nature to CBS&#x27;s science fiction Western, &quot;The Wild Wild West,&quot; in that the plots were bizarre and had elements of science-fiction and steampunk technology thrown in. Even the Lone Ranger&#x27;s greatest enemy in the animated series was a dwarf, similar to James T. West&#x27;s greatest enemy, Dr. Miguelito Loveless. He was called Tiny Tom, and was voiced by Dick Beals. This animated cartoon was credited as being a Jack Wrather production, and it provided the first exposure many 1960s children had to the characters.

The Lone Ranger&#x27;s voice was provided by Michael Rye, who had portrayed &quot;Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy&quot; on radio. Shepard Menken played Tonto. The narrator in the opening title was Marvin Miller. Other &quot;guest voices&quot; were provided by Paul Winchell, Agnes Moorehead and Hans Conried.

===&quot;The Tarzan/Lone Ranger Adventure Hour&quot;, early 1980s===
The Lone Ranger was featured, along with Zorro and Tarzan, in &quot;Adventure Hour&quot; cartoon shorts in the early 1980s, produced by Filmation. These episodes featured William Conrad as the voice of the Masked Man, although he was listed in the credits as &quot;J. Darnoc&quot; (Conrad spelled backward). This series took a more realistic tone with a heavily historical context to include an educational element to the stories, even though there were several episodes that did feature elements of science fiction (much like the earlier cartoons from the 1960s). There were 14 episodes, combining two adventures in each episode, for a total of 28 stories. Though Conrad was the main voice featured, other noted voice actors in the Filmation series include an uncredited Lou Scheimer, Frank Welker, and Michael Bell.

===&quot;The Lone Ranger &quot;(2003)===
In 2003, the WB network aired a two-hour Lone Ranger TV movie, starring Chad Michael Murray as the Lone Ranger. The TV movie served as the pilot for a possible new series. However, the movie was greeted unenthusiastically; the name of the secret identity of the Lone Ranger was changed from &quot;John Reid&quot; to &quot;Luke Hartman&quot;, and while an empty grave was still alongside those of the five dead Rangers, its supposed occupant was unidentified, and the hero maintained his unmasked identity, as well, becoming a cowboy version of Zorro, as in the first film serial. Ultimately, the project was shelved, with the pilot aired in telefilm form during the summer season due to Murray&#x27;s popularity with the target audience of the network.

===Other appearances===

Clayton Moore appeared in character in an episode of &quot;Lassie&quot; in 1958. John Hart appeared in an episode of &quot;Happy Days&quot;.
An episode of &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot;, titled, &quot;My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys,&quot; had a special appearance by John Hart as The Lone Ranger. In the story, superhero Ralph Hinkley is despondent over his failures, and considers giving up, until he is encouraged by Hart&#x27;s retelling of the Lone Ranger&#x27;s exploits.

==Films==

===Clayton Moore series===
After the end of the television series, Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels starred in two feature films, &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; in 1956 and &quot;The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold&quot; in 1958.

====&quot;The Lone Ranger and the Peace Patrol&quot;====
In 1958 the Lone Ranger appeared in the eight-minute-long documentary, &quot;The Lone Ranger and the Peace Patrol&quot;. Presented and narrated by Clayton Moore, it revolves around purchasing U.S. Savings Stamps, a child&#x27;s version of Savings Bonds. The main focus is to get children to invest in the stamps. The narrated segment culminates with the inaugural ceremonies on the grounds of the Washington Memorial before a crowd of thousands of children and their parents.

===Other Lone Rangers===

====&quot;The Legend of the Lone Ranger&quot; (1981)====

At the time of the 1981 release of the film &quot;The Legend of the Lone Ranger&quot;, the company that owned the rights to the character, Wrather Corp., filed a lawsuit and obtained a court injunction to prevent Clayton Moore from appearing as the Lone Ranger, and then gave a cameo to his TV replacement, John Hart. The film itself was a critical and commercial failure. It starred Klinton Spilsbury in his only motion picture appearance. His lines were overdubbed by James Keach. The part of Tonto was played by Michael Horse.

Moore, who never appeared publicly without his mask, was enjoined in the lawsuit from wearing it and, in protest, he began wearing oversized sunglasses that were the approximate size and shape of the mask. In a sequence in the movie, John Reid, a newly graduated attorney, is travelling west in a stagecoach to meet his brother. Another passenger announces his intent to make his fortune from his invention of sunglasses. The stage is robbed and the inventor killed. As John Reid lays the dead man on the floor with the broken dark glasses, yet another passenger says, &quot;So much for American opportunity.&quot;

====&quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; (2013)====
In 2013, Walt Disney Pictures released &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, starring Armie Hammer as the Lone Ranger and Johnny Depp as Tonto. Directed by Gore Verbinski, the film is an origin story of the two characters and explores the duo&#x27;s efforts to subdue the immoral actions of the corrupt, and to bring them to justice, in the American Old West. The film, produced with an estimated budget of $225 million, was received negatively by American critics and performed poorly at the box office.

==Other media==
The series also inspired numerous books, comic books, and records.

===Novels===
The first Lone Ranger novel appeared in 1936, and eventually 18 volumes were published, as listed below. The first book was written by Gaylord Du Bois, but the others were written by the character&#x27;s primary developer, Fran Striker. Striker also re-edited and rewrote parts of later editions of the first novel. First published between 1936 and 1956 in hardback by Grosset and Dunlap, these stories were reprinted in 1978 by Pinnacle Books.

In 2012, Moonstone Books published the novel &quot;The Lone Ranger: Vendetta&quot;, written by Howard Hopkins.

===Anthologies===
In 2012, Moonstone Books published the anthology &quot;The Lone Ranger Chronicles&quot;, edited by Matthew Baugh with stories by Johnny Boggs, James Reasoner, Mel Odom, Bill Crider, Matthew Baugh, Tim Lasiuta, Joe Gentile, Paul Kupperberg, Dennis O&#x27;Neil, Kent Conwell, David McDonald, Thom Brannon, Troy D. Smith, Chuck Dixon, and Richard Dean Starr, stories incorporating famous characters of the western, such as Cisco Kid, Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday.

Moonstone followed this up in 2018 with a second anthology, also edited by Matthew Baugh, &quot;The Lone Ranger and Tonto: Frontier Justice&quot;. This volume featured stories by Spur Award winners Troy D. Smith and Johnny Boggs, as well as Matthew Baugh, Frank Schildiner, Chuck Dixon, Joe Gentile, Richard Dean Starr, Tim Lasiuta, Bill Crider, Win Scott Eckert, and Thom Brannon. Troy D. Smith’s story, “The Lake Spirit”, won Western Fictioneers’ Peacemaker Award for Best Short Western Fiction.

In, 1993, Perennial published the anthology &quot;The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven&quot;, a collection of linked short stories by Sherman Alexie. Despite the title, these stories are not authorized Lone Ranger adaptations or focused mainly on the characters. Rather, the Lone Ranger and Tonto are symbols for white and Native-American identity, respectively, along with other cultural references.

===Newspaper strip===
In 1938, King Features Syndicate debuted a comic strip about the Lone Ranger, initially written by Fran Striker, himself. When the time involved proved too much, Striker left the strip and it was turned over to Bob Green, later followed by Paul S. Newman and others. The strip began with art by Ed Kressy. In 1939, art chores were handed over to Charles Flanders, who remained with the strip until 1971, when the strip ended.

In 1981, the New York Times Syndicate launched a second Lone Ranger strip, written by Cary Bates with art by Russ Heath. It ran until 1984. In 1993 Pure Imagination Publishing collected two of the storylines and put them in a comic book.

===Comic books===

Western Publishing, with its publishing partner Dell Comics, originally published some stand-alone &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; stories in 4 of Dell&#x27;s &quot;Large Feature Comics&quot; (1939–1941) and in 7 issues of Dell&#x27;s &quot;Four Color Comics&quot; series (1945–1947). (&quot;Lone Ranger&quot; stories also appeared in miscellaneous issues of &quot;Ace Comics&quot;, &quot;March of Comics&quot;, &quot;Future Comics&quot;, &quot;King Comics&quot; and &quot;Magic Comics&quot;, all anthology-type comic book titles.)

In 1948, Dell launched an actual &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; comic book title which began with No. 1 and lasted for 145 issues. This series originally consisted of reprints from the newspaper strips (as had all previous comic book appearances of the character in various titles from David McKay Publications and from Dell). However, new stories by writer Paul S. Newman and artist Tom Gill began with issue No. 38 (August 1951). Some original content was presented as early as No. 7 (January 1949), but these were non-Lone Ranger fillers. Newman and Gill produced the series until its final issue, No. 145 (July 1962).

Tonto got his own spin-off title in 1951, which lasted 31 issues. Such was the Ranger&#x27;s popularity at the time that even his horse Silver had a comic book, &quot;The Lone Ranger&#x27;s Famous Horse Hi-Yo Silver&quot;, starting in 1952 and running 34 issues; writer Gaylord DuBois wrote and developed Silver as a hero in his own right. In addition, Dell also published three big &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; annuals, as well as an adaptation of the 1956 theatrical film.

The Dell series came to an end in 1962. Later that same year, Western Publishing ended its publishing partnership with Dell Comics and started its own comic book imprint, Gold Key Comics. The new imprint launched its own &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; title in 1964. Initially reprinting material from the Dell run, original content did not begin until issue No. 22 in 1975, and the magazine itself folded with No. 28 in 1977. Additionally the same year, AB published a three-part Swedish Lone Ranger story in &quot;Hemmets Journal&quot;.

In 1994, Topps Comics produced a four-issue miniseries, &quot;The Lone Ranger and Tonto&quot;, written by Joe R. Lansdale and drawn by Timothy Truman. One of the major changes in this series was the characterization of Tonto, who was now shown to be a very witty, outspoken, and sarcastic character, even willing to punch the Lone Ranger during a heated argument, and commenting on his past pop-culture depictions with the words, &quot;Of course, &quot;quimo sabe&quot;. Maybe when we talk I should use that &#x27;me Tonto&#x27; stuff, the way they write about me in the dime novels. You&#x27;d like that, wouldn&#x27;t you?&quot;.

The first issue of a new Lone Ranger series from Dynamite Entertainment by Brett Matthews and Sergio Cariello shipped on September 6, 2006. It was started as a six-issue miniseries; but due to its success, it has become an ongoing series by the same team. On September 15, 2006, Dynamite Entertainment announced that &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; No. 1 had sold out its first printing. A second printing of the first issue was announced; a first for the company. The series has received an Eisner Awards nomination for best new series in 2007. &quot;True West&quot; magazine awarded the publication the &quot;Best Western Comic Book of the Year&quot; in their 2009 &quot;Best of The West Source Book!&quot; And in 2010 Dynamite released &quot;The Lone Ranger Avenges the Death of Zorro&quot;.

The second volume of the series by Dynamite was issued in January 2012. Written by Ande Parks and drawn by Esteve Polls, it ran for a total of 25 numbers, with the last issue being released in June 2014.

Apart from the ongoing series, Dynamite released several miniseries starring the Lone Ranger, such as &quot;The Lone Ranger and Tonto&quot; (4 issues, written by Brett Matthews; John Abrams with art by Mario Guevara) in 2008; &quot;Snake of Iron&quot;, a 5-part by Chuck Dixon and Steve Polls published in 2012, and &quot;Vindicated&quot;, 4 issues by Justin Gray and Rey Villegas in 2014.

In 2016, The Lone Ranger teamed-up with the Green Hornet in a 5-part miniseries written by Michael Uslan with art by Giovani Timpano.

A Dynamite &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; third volume, written by Mark Russell and drawn by Bob Q, was released in October 2018 and ran 5 issues.

===&quot;The Lone Ranger (Pulp) Magazine&quot;===
In 1937, eight issues of &quot;The Lone Ranger Magazine&quot; (pulps) were published by Trojan Publishing, with stories written by Fran Striker. The series was recently reprinted as facsimiles by Adventure House Publishing.

===1930s cartoon===
In late 1930s Roy Meredith produced the first-known animated film based on Lone Ranger, in this silent film The Lone Ranger and Tonto capture a band of cattle rustlers and save the life of the rancher.

This cartoon was produced by &quot;Pathegrams&quot; on 16mm film and sold to the home market and libraries, which often showed cartoons as a prelude to the feature films they would play for children, much as they do videos now. It was a silent film, like most films produced for the home market in those days, and had dialog written on title cards, just as films of the silent era.

===Video game===
A video game version of &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; was released by Konami for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America in 1991. It is an action adventure game featuring three different perspectives: side-scrolling, overhead, and first-person exploration. The game loosely follows the plot of the 1981 film &quot;The Legend of the Lone Ranger,&quot; with the ultimate goal being the rescue of the President of the United States, whom the Lone Ranger&#x27;s nemesis, &quot;Butch&quot; Cavendish, has kidnapped.

==Merchandise==

===Premiums===
&quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; program offered many radio premiums, including the Lone Ranger Six-Shooter Ring and the Lone Ranger Deputy Badge. Some used a silver bullet motif. One ring had a miniature of one of his six-guns atop it, with a flint and striking wheel, as used in cigarette lighters, so that &quot;fanning&quot; the miniature pistol would produce a shower of sparks. During World War II, the premiums adapted to the times. In 1942, the program offered the Kix Blackout Kit.

Some premiums were rather anachronistic for a 19th-century hero. In 1947, the program offered the Kix Atomic Bomb Ring, also known to collectors as the Lone Ranger Atom Bomb Ring. This ring was a miniature spinthariscope that actually had a small amount of polonium-210 in it, which emitted alpha particles to produce scintillations on the zinc sulfide outer part of the ring. With its tailfin piece removed, though, the &quot;bomb&quot; body looked like a silver bullet.

The sponsor was General Mills, with its breakfast-cereal products: Cheerios, Wheaties, and Kix. In 1947, Cheerios produced a line of Frontier Town cereal boxes with the Lone Ranger likeness on the front of the box. Different versions of the boxes would have Frontier Town buildings on their backs to cut out. One could also send in ten cents and a box-top to get each of the four map sections of the town. These, as well as nine different boxes, were needed to complete the cardboard Frontier Town.

===Toys and games===
Besides the premiums offered in connection with the radio series, there have been many Lone Ranger commercial toys released over the years. One of the most successful was a line of 10-inch action figures and accessories released by Gabriel Toys in 1973. Board games were released by Parker Brothers: The Lone Ranger Game, in 1938, and The New Lone Ranger Game, in 1956.

==Parodies and spoofs==

In the 1939 Looney Tunes &quot;The Lone Stranger and Porky&quot;, supervised by Bob Clampett, the masked man comes to the rescue of stagecoach driver in distress, Porky Pig.

In 1940, Hugh Harman made a Lone Ranger parody for MGM Cartoons titled &quot;The Lonesome Stranger&quot;.

Jay Silverheels appeared as Tonto on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; starring Johnny Carson in a comedy sketch in which Carson is interviewing Tonto for employment. The audio portion of this sketch was included in the LP &quot;Here&#x27;s Johnny: Magic Moments from the Tonight Show&quot;, released by Casablanca Records in 1974.

Both Clayton Moore and Silverheels appeared as the Lone Ranger and Tonto in a commercial for Jeno&#x27;s Pizza Rolls produced by ad man/satirist Stan Freberg. The commercial was a spoof of a then-current commercial for Lark cigarettes which also used the &quot;William Tell&quot; overture theme music.

A recorded routine by comic Lenny Bruce formed the basis for the 1971 animated cartoon, &quot;Thank You Mask Man&quot;, produced by John Magnuson Associates. This was an adult humor routine, comically implying a gay relationship between the Ranger and Tonto.

Parody versions of The Lone Ranger (called Lonely Rider) and Tonto appear as main characters in the 1971 Finnish western comedy &quot;The Unhanged&quot; (&quot;Hirttämättömät&quot;). They were played by Vesa-Matti Loiri and Simo Salminen.

&quot;The Top Ranger&quot; is a parody produced by Disney starring Mickey Mouse (Top Ranger) and Goofy (Tonto-lone), with the story and illustrations by Marco Gervasio and published in an Italian comic book, &quot;Topolino&quot; #3005 (July 2, 2013).

&quot;The Provolone Ranger&quot;, an episode of the &quot;Super Mario Bros. Super Show&quot;, featured Mario donning a mask to fight outlaws alongside of a speedy companion named Pronto. In a spoof of the Lone Ranger&#x27;s habit of leaving before those whom he has helped can thank him, the episode ends with Mario returning to collect a reward of pasta.

In &quot;Wild West Rangers&quot;, a two-part episode of &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, Pink Ranger Kimberly Hart (Amy Jo Johnson) falls backward through time to the Old West, where she meets look-alike ancestors of her fellow Power Rangers and other characters in the show. A hero called the White Stranger, a mask-less duplicate of Kimberly&#x27;s boyfriend Tommy Oliver, the White Ranger (played by Jason David Frank) rides to the rescue on more than one occasion when danger threatens.

In &quot;Who Was That Mashed Man&quot;, a 1987 episode from the fifth season of &quot;Night Court&quot;, an old actor who had played a Lone Ranger-esque character named the Red Ranger was being sued to prevent his appearing in public in costume by a movie company seeking to release a new movie based on the Red Ranger.

In &quot;The Land Before Time VI: The Secret of Saurus Rock&quot; (1998), the sixth film in &quot;The Land Before Time franchise&quot;, Littlefoot&#x27;s grandfather tells the children, the legend about &quot;The Lone Dinosaur&quot;, a legendary Longneck who protected the Great Valley from the most ferocious Sharptooth to ever live.

In &quot;VeggieTales&quot;, there is an episode that is a retelling of the story of Moses leading the Hebrews out of Egypt from the Book of Exodus, a sequel to &quot;The Ballad of Little Joe&quot; and a parody of the Lone Ranger called &quot;Moe and the Big Exit&quot; with Larry the Cucumber as the Lone Stranger, who is the parody of the Lone Ranger and is the episode&#x27;s equivalent to the biblical Moses.

Musician Frank Zappa occasionally featured brief references to the Lone Ranger in some of his songs, usually an exclaimed &quot;Hi Yo Silver!&quot;. This habit started in the 1980s after an on-stage joke from band member Ike Willis.

==Ownership==
From its inception, George W. Trendle had legal ownership of the Lone Ranger and characters associated with the Lone Ranger through his company, The Lone Ranger, Inc. Trendle sold The Lone Ranger, Inc. to oil man and film producer Jack Wrather in 1954 for $3 million (). After Wrather died in 1984, his widow, Bonita Granville, sold the Wrather Productions properties to Southbrook International Television Co. in 1985 for $10 million (). Broadway Video acquired the rights in 1988. Classic Media acquired the rights in 2000. DreamWorks Animation acquired Classic Media in 2012 and renamed the division DreamWorks Classics. This was later acquired by NBCUniversal in 2016 for $3.8 billion (). Its Universal Pictures unit currently has the rights to the Lone Ranger.

==Possible inspirations==

===John R. Hughes===
The character was originally believed to be inspired by Texas Ranger Captain John R. Hughes, to whom the book &quot;The Lone Star Ranger&quot; by Zane Grey was dedicated in 1915. John R. Hughes was born on February 11, 1855, in Henry County, Illinois. At 14 years old, he made his way into Indian Territory and lived among the Choctaw, Osage, and Comanche. In 1886, at 31 years old, Hughes killed a number of men for stealing his and a neighbor&#x27;s horses, and for a number of months, trailed the ones whom he did not kill. This would mark his first time actively participating in bounty hunter-like activities. Not long after that in 1887, Hughes assisted Texas Ranger Ira Aten in tracking and killing an escaped murderer. A month after, he was persuaded to join the ranks of the Rangers and served along the southwest borders of Texas, and at 38 years old, Hughes became the captain of Company D. Frontier Battalion. He went on to retire in 1915, after serving 28 years as a Ranger. He was dying and chose to end his own life at 92 years old on June 3, 1947, and was buried in Austin, Texas.
Many could relate John Hughes to being the Lone Ranger due to his career as an actual Texas Ranger, and because he actually lived in Texas, unlike others who have been cited as possibilities. He learned the languages of the Native American tribes that he lived among for some time, which could make him a more competent ranger when traveling familiar territory to track down criminals and give him the ability to communicate with other native people. He went on to capture and kill many criminals without ever being injured in his 28 years as a Ranger.

===Bass Reeves===
In his 2006 Reeves biography &quot;Black Gun, Silver Star&quot;, historian Art T. Burton suggests one possible historical inspiration was Bass Reeves, the first Black deputy U.S. Marshal west of the Mississippi River. After escaping slavery during the Civil War, Bass Reeves spent the remainder of the war in Indian Territory, in what would become Oklahoma. After the Civil War, Reeves was appointed as a U.S. Marshal in Indian Territory, and then worked as a Marshal for 32 years. Burton suggests that Reeves&#x27;s career as a lawman was widely known in his time and cites similarities with the Lone Ranger, including wearing disguises, having a Native American partner, riding a white or grey horse, giving out silver keepsakes, and possessing legendary marksmanship and horsemanship skills. Burton&#x27;s theory is disputed for a number of reasons. Reeves was never a Ranger nor did he ever live in Texas, and it was a common practice of U.S. Marshals working in Indian territories to have Indian assistants and to use silver dollars as payments or tributes. Critics of the Bass theory also point out that it was common for pulp fiction writers to portray heroes as masked individuals. Ultimately, Burton notes that it is not possible &quot;to prove conclusively that Reeves was the inspiration for the Lone Ranger&quot;, but he is &quot;the closest real person to resemble [him]&quot;.

===Others===
Other suggested inspirations were Zorro and Robin Hood.

<text>The Shadow is a fictional character created by American magazine publishers Street &amp; Smith and writer Walter B. Gibson. Originally created to be a mysterious radio show narrator, and developed into a distinct literary character in 1931 by Gibson, The Shadow has been adapted into other forms of media, including American comic books, comic strips, serials, video games, and at least five feature films. The radio drama included episodes voiced by Orson Welles.

The Shadow debuted on July 31, 1930, as the mysterious narrator of the radio program &quot;Detective Story Hour&quot;, which was developed to boost sales of Street &amp; Smith&#x27;s monthly pulp &quot;Detective Story Magazine&quot;. When listeners of the program began asking at newsstands for copies of &quot;that Shadow detective magazine&quot;, Street &amp; Smith launched a magazine based on the character, and hired Gibson to create a concept to fit the name and voice and to write a story featuring him. The first issue of the pulp series &quot;The Shadow Magazine&quot; went on sale April 1, 1931.

On September 26, 1937, &quot;The Shadow&quot;, a new radio drama based on the character as created by Gibson for the pulp magazine, premiered with the story &quot;The Death House Rescue&quot;, in which The Shadow was characterized as having &quot;the hypnotic power to cloud men&#x27;s minds so they cannot see him&quot;. In the magazine stories, The Shadow did not become literally invisible.

The introductory line from the radio adaptation of The Shadow – &quot;Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows!&quot; – spoken by actor Frank Readick, has earned a place in the American idiom. These words were accompanied by an ominous laugh and a musical theme, Camille Saint-Saëns&#x27; &quot;Le Rouet d&#x27;Omphale&quot; (&quot;Omphale&#x27;s Spinning Wheel&quot; composed in 1872).

The Shadow, at the end of each episode, reminded listeners, &quot;The weed of crime bears bitter fruit! Crime does not pay...The Shadow knows!&quot;

Some early episodes used the alternate statement, &quot;As you sow evil, so shall you reap evil! Crime does not pay...The Shadow knows!&quot;

==Publication history==
===Origin of the character&#x27;s name===
To boost the sales of its &quot;Detective Story Magazine,&quot; Street &amp; Smith Publications hired David Chrisman, of the Ruthrauff &amp; Ryan advertising agency, and writer-director William Sweets to adapt the magazine&#x27;s stories into a radio series. Chrisman and Sweets thought the upcoming series should be narrated by a mysterious storyteller with a sinister voice and began searching for a suitable name. One of their scriptwriters, Harry Engman Charlot, suggested various possibilities, such as &quot;The Inspector&quot; or &quot;The Sleuth&quot;. Charlot then proposed the ideal name for the phantom announcer: &quot;The Shadow&quot;.

Thus, beginning on July 31, 1930, &quot;The Shadow&quot; was the name given to the mysterious narrator of the &quot;Detective Story Hour&quot; radio program. The narrator was initially voiced by James LaCurto, who was replaced after four months by prolific character actor Frank Readick Jr. The episodes were drawn from the &quot;Detective Story Magazine&quot; issued by Street &amp; Smith, the nation&#x27;s oldest and largest publisher of pulp magazines at the time. Although the latter company had hoped the radio broadcasts would boost the declining sales of &quot;Detective Story Magazine&quot;, the result was quite different. Listeners found the sinister announcer much more compelling than the unrelated stories. They soon began asking newsdealers for copies of &quot;that &quot;Shadow&quot; detective magazine&quot;, even though it did not exist.

===Creation as a distinctive literary character===

Recognizing the demand and responding promptly, circulation manager Henry William Ralston of Street &amp; Smith commissioned Walter B. Gibson to begin writing stories about &quot;The Shadow&quot; Using the pen name of Maxwell Grant and claiming the stories were &quot;from The Shadow&#x27;s private annals&quot; as told to him, Gibson wrote 282 out of 325 tales over the next 20 years: a novel-length story twice a month (1st and 15th). The first story produced was &quot;The Living Shadow&quot; published April 1, 1931.

Gibson&#x27;s characterization of The Shadow laid the foundations for the archetype of the superhero, including stylized imagery and title, sidekicks, supervillains, and a secret identity. Clad in black, The Shadow operated mainly after dark as a vigilante in the name of justice, terrifying criminals into vulnerability. Gibson himself claimed the literary inspirations upon which he had drawn were Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; and Edward Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s &quot;The House and the Brain&quot;. Another possible inspiration for The Shadow is the French character Judex; the first episode of the original &quot;Judex&quot; film serial was released in the United States as &quot;The Mysterious Shadow&quot;, and Judex&#x27;s costume is similar to The Shadow&#x27;s. French comics historian Xavier Fournier notes other similarities with another silent serial, &quot;The Shielding Shadow&quot;, whose protagonist had a power of invisibility, and considers The Shadow to be a mix between the two characters. In the 1940s, some &quot;Shadow&quot; comic strips were translated in France as adventures of Judex.

Because of the great effort involved in writing two full-length novels every month, several guest writers were hired to write occasional installments in order to lighten Gibson&#x27;s workload. Those guest writers included Lester Dent, who also wrote the Doc Savage stories, and Theodore Tinsley. In the late 1940s, mystery novelist Bruce Elliott (also a magician) temporarily replaced Gibson as the primary author of the pulp series (he wrote #&#x27;s 306 through 320). Richard Wormser, a reader for Street &amp; Smith, wrote two Shadow stories. For a complete list of Street and Smith&#x27;s Shadow novels (and a list of the reprint editions), see the List of The Shadow stories article.

===A new beginning at Belmont Books===
&quot;The Shadow Magazine&quot; ceased publication with the Summer 1949 issue, but Walter B. Gibson wrote three new &quot;official&quot; stories between 1963 and 1980. The first began a new series of nine Shadow mass market paperback novels from Belmont Books. In this series, The Shadow is given psychic powers, including the radio character&#x27;s ability &quot;to cloud men&#x27;s minds&quot;, so that he effectively became invisible. &quot;Return of The Shadow&quot; was published under his own name. The remaining eight novels in this series, &quot;The Shadow Strikes&quot;, &quot;Shadow Beware&quot;, &quot;Cry Shadow&quot;, &quot;The Shadow&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, &quot;Mark of The Shadow&quot;, &quot;Shadow Go Mad&quot;, &quot;Night of The Shadow&quot;, and &quot;The Shadow, Destination: Moon&quot;, were written by Dennis Lynds, not Gibson, under the Maxwell Grant pseudonym.

The other two Gibson works were the novelettes &quot;The Riddle of the Rangoon Ruby&quot;, published June 1, 1979 in &quot;The Shadow Scrapbook&quot;. and &quot;Blackmail Bay&quot;, published February 1, 1980 in &quot;The Duende History of The Shadow Magazine&quot;.

===Literary sequels and reboots===
The Shadow returned in 2015 in the authorized novel &quot;The Sinister Shadow&quot;, an entry in the &quot;Wild Adventures of Doc Savage&quot; series from Altus Press. The novel, written by Will Murray, used unpublished material originally written in 1932 by Doc Savage originator Lester Dent and published under the pen name Kenneth Robeson. Set in 1933, the story details the conflict between the two pulp magazine icons during a crime wave caused by a murderous kidnapping-extortion ring led by the mysterious criminal mastermind known as the Funeral Director.

A sequel, &quot;Empire of Doom&quot;, was published in 2016 and takes place seven years later in 1940. The Shadow&#x27;s old enemy, Shiwan Khan, attacks his hated adversary. Doc Savage joins forces with The Shadow to vanquish Khan in a Doc Savage novel written by Murray, from a concept by Dent.

In 2020, James Patterson Entertainment and Condé Nast Entertainment announced a new series written by James Patterson and Brian Sitts. The arrangement also includes potential screen adaptations of these novels. The first novel, &quot;The Shadow&quot;, released in 2021, serves as a sequel-update with some science-fiction elements, bringing Lamont Cranston from 1937 into 2087 to battle Shiwan Khan in a futuristic New York. The second Patterson-Sitts Shadow novel, &quot;Circle of Death&quot;, was published in 2023.

==Character development==
The character and look of The Shadow gradually evolved over his lengthy fictional existence:

As depicted in the pulps, The Shadow wore a wide-brimmed black hat and a black, crimson-lined cloak with an upturned collar over a standard black business suit. In the 1940s comic books, the later comic book series, and the 1994 film starring Alec Baldwin, he wore either the black hat or a wide-brimmed, black fedora and a crimson scarf just below his nose and across his mouth and chin. Both the cloak and scarf covered either a black double-breasted trench coat or a regular black suit. As seen in some of the later comics series, The Shadow also would wear his hat and scarf with either a black Inverness coat or Inverness cape.

In the radio drama that debuted in 1937, The Shadow does not wear a costume because he is invisible when he operates as a vigilante, a feature born out of necessity. Time constraints of 1930s radio made it difficult to explain to listeners where The Shadow was hiding and how he remained concealed from criminals until he was ready to strike, so the character was given invisibility, meaning the criminals (like the radio audience) only knew him by his haunting voice. The actors used their normal voice when the hero was in his civilian identity of Lamont Cranston and effects were added when he became invisible and acted as The Shadow, his voice now having a sinister and seemingly omnipresent quality. To explain this power, radio episodes regularly said that while a young man, The Shadow traveled around the world and then through the Orient, where he learned how to read thoughts and became a master of hypnotism, granting him &quot;the mysterious power to cloud men&#x27;s minds, so they could not see him&quot;. In the episode &quot;The Temple Bells of Neban&quot; (1937), The Shadow said he developed these abilities in India specifically, under the guidance of a &quot;Yogi priest&quot; who was &quot;Keeper of the Temple of Cobras&quot; in Delhi. He does not wear a mask or any disguise while invisible, and so in episodes such as &quot;The Temple Bells of Neban&quot; he is cautious when he meets an enemy who could potentially disrupt his hypnotic abilities, exposing his true face and instantly making him a visible target for attack.

=== Background ===

In the print adventures, The Shadow is Kent Allard, although his real name is not revealed until &quot;The Shadow Unmasks&quot; (1937). Early stories explain he was once a famed aviator who fought for the French during World War I, known by the alias the &quot;Black Eagle&quot; according to one character in &quot;The Shadow&#x27;s Shadow&quot; (1933). Later stories revised this alias as the &quot;Dark Eagle&quot;, beginning with &quot;The Shadow Unmasks&quot;. After the war&#x27;s conclusion, Allard finds a new challenge in waging war on criminals. Allard falsifies his death by crash landing his plane in Guatemala, encountering the indigenous &quot;Xinca tribe&quot; as a result, who see him as a supernatural being and provide him with two loyal aides. Allard returns to the United States and takes residence in New York City, adopting numerous identities to acquire valuable information and conceal his true nature, and recruiting a variety of agents to aid his war on crime, only a few of whom are aware of his other identities.

As the vigilante called The Shadow, Allard hunts down and often violently confronts criminals, armed with Colt .45 pistols and sometimes using magician tricks to convince his prey that he&#x27;s supernatural. One such trick is “The Devil&#x27;s Whisper”, a chemical compound on the thumb and forefinger, causing a flash of bright flame and sharp explosion when he snaps his fingers. The Shadow is also known for wearing a girasol ring with a purple stone (sometimes depicted as a red stone in cover artwork), given to Allard by the Czar of Russia (&quot;The Romanoff Jewels&quot;, 1932) during World War I. The ring is later said to be one of two rings made with gemstones taken from the eyes of an idol made by the Xinca tribe (&quot;The Shadow Unmasks,&quot; 1937).

The Shadow&#x27;s best known alter ego is Lamont Cranston, a &quot;wealthy young man-about-town&quot;. In the pulps, Cranston is a separate character, a rich playboy who travels the world while The Shadow uses his identity and resources in New York (&quot;The Shadow Laughs&quot;, 1931). The Shadow&#x27;s disguise as Cranston works well because the two men resemble each other (&quot;Dictator of Crime&quot;, 1941). In their first meeting, The Shadow threatens Cranston, saying that unless the playboy agrees to allow the aviator to use his identity when he is abroad, then Allard will simply take over the man&#x27;s identity entirely, having already made arrangements to begin the process, including switching signatures on various documents. Although alarmed at first, the real Lamont Cranston agrees, deciding that sharing his resources and identity is better than losing both entirely. The two men sometimes meet afterward in order to impersonate each other (&quot;Crime over Miami&quot;, 1940). As Cranston, The Shadow often attends the Cobalt Club, an exclusive restaurant and lounge catering to the wealthy, and associates with New York City Police Commissioner Ralph Weston.

The Shadow&#x27;s other disguises include: businessman Henry Arnaud, who like Cranston is a real person whose identity Allard simply assumes at times, as revealed in Arnaud&#x27;s first appearance &quot;The Black Master&quot; (March 1, 1932); elderly Isaac Twambley, who first appears in &quot;No Time for Murder&quot; (December 1944); and Fritz, an old, seemingly slow-witted, uncommunicative janitor who works at police headquarters, listening in on conversations and examining recovered evidence, first appearing in &quot;The Living Shadow&quot; (April 1931).

In &quot;Teeth of the Dragon&quot; and later stories including &quot;The Golden Pagoda&quot;, The Shadow is known in Chinatown as Ying Ko, often fighting the criminal Tong.

In the 2015 Altus Press novel &quot;The Sinister Shadow&quot; by Will Murray, The Shadow masquerades as celebrated criminologist George Clarendon of Chicago, a past member of the Cobalt Club and long-time friend of Commissioner Weston.

For the first half of The Shadow&#x27;s tenure in the pulps, his past and true identity (outside of his Cranston disguise) are ambiguous. In &quot;The Living Shadow&quot;, a thug claiming to have seen the Shadow&#x27;s face recalls seeing &quot;a piece of white that looked like a bandage&quot;. In &quot;The Black Master&quot; and &quot;The Shadow&#x27;s Shadow&quot;, the villains of both stories see The Shadow&#x27;s true face and remark the vigilante is a man of many faces with no face of his own. It was not until the August 1937 issue, &quot;The Shadow Unmasks&quot;, that The Shadow&#x27;s real name was revealed.

In the radio drama series that premiered in 1937, the Allard secret identity and backstory were dropped for simplicity&#x27;s sake. The radio incarnation of The Shadow is really and only Lamont Cranston with no other regular cover identities, though he does adopt disguises and short-term aliases during some adventures. The radio version of Cranston travels the world to &quot;learn the old mysteries that modern science has not yet rediscovered&quot; (&quot;Death House Rescue&quot; in 1937). Along with learning skills and knowledge in Europe, Africa, and Asia, he spends time training with a Yogi priest, &quot;Keeper of the Temple of Cobras&quot;, in Delhi and learns how to read thoughts and hypnotize people enough to &quot;cloud&quot; their minds, making himself invisible to them (as revealed in the episode &quot;The Temple Bells of Neban&quot; in 1937). He explicitly states in several episodes that his talents are not magic but based on science. Returning to New York, he decides he can best aid the police and his city by operating outside the law as an invisible vigilante. He is somewhat less ruthless and more compassionate than the pulp incarnation, and without the vast network of agents and operatives. Only cab driver/chauffeur Shrevvy makes regular appearances on the radio series, but the character is different from his print counterpart. Commissioner Weston and a few other supporting characters from the print stories also are adapted to radio.

===Supporting characters===

The Shadow has a network of agents who assist him in his war on crime. These include:

* Harry Vincent - A man who tries to commit suicide in the first Shadow story. The Shadow saves and recruits him, after which Vincent is a regular recurring character in the pulp stories and one of the most trusted agents.
* Moses &quot;Moe&quot; Shrevnitz, a.k.a. &quot;Shrevvy&quot; - A cab driver who doubles as his chauffeur. The radio version of Shrevvy is dimwitted and does not knowingly work for The Shadow, aiding Lamont Cranston on many occasions. Peter Boyle performed the role in the 1994 film.
* Margo Lane - A socialite created for the radio drama and introduced in the debut episode &quot;The Death House Rescue&quot; as The Shadow&#x27;s companion who loves him. Margo aids the Shadow in nearly every radio episode and was later introduced into the pulps as one of his agents. Penelope Ann Miller performed the role in the 1994 film, in which Margo had the power of telepathy, allowing her to pierce The Shadow&#x27;s hypnotic mental-clouding abilities.
* Clyde Burke - A newspaper reporter who also is initially paid to collect news clippings for The Shadow.
* Burbank - A radio operator who maintains contact between The Shadow and his agents. He was portrayed by Andre Gregory in the 1994 film.
* Clifford &quot;Cliff&quot; Marsland - He first appeared in the ninth novel &quot;Mobsmen on the Spot&quot;. A man with a checkered past known to The Shadow, he changed his name to Clifford Marsland. Having spent years in Sing Sing maximum security prison for a crime he did not commit, he is wrongly believed by the underworld to have murdered one or more people. He infiltrates gangs using his crooked reputation (the Green Hornet is often described as having a &quot;modus operandi&quot; similar to that of Marsland).
* Dr. Rupert Sayre - The Shadow&#x27;s personal physician.
* Jericho Druke - A large, immensely strong black man.
* Slade Farrow - He works with The Shadow to rehabilitate criminals.
* Miles Crofton - He sometimes pilots The Shadow&#x27;s autogyro.
* Claude Fellows - The only agent of The Shadow ever shown to be killed in &quot;Gangdom&#x27;s Doom&quot; (1931).
* Rutledge Mann - A stockbroker who collects information, taking over for Claude Fellows after the latter&#x27;s death. First appeared in &quot;Double Z&quot; (June 1, 1932). After his business failed and he acquired heavy debt, he was ready to commit suicide before The Shadow, knowing about his situation, recruited him.
* Hawkeye - A reformed underworld snoop who trails gangsters and other criminals.
* Myra Reldon - A female operative who uses the alias of Ming Dwan when in Chinatown.
* Dr. Roy Tam - The Shadow&#x27;s contact man in New York&#x27;s Chinatown. Sab Shimono portrayed him in the 1994 film, in which he provided valuable scientific information to Lamont Cranston, believing the latter to be an agent of The Shadow.

Though initially wanted by the police, The Shadow also works with and through them, notably gleaning information from his many chats (as Cranston) at the Cobalt Club with NYPD Commissioner Ralph Weston and later Commissioner Wainwright Barth, who is also Cranston&#x27;s uncle (portrayed by Jonathan Winters in the 1994 film). Weston believes Cranston is merely a rich playboy who dabbles in detective work out of curiosity. Another police contact is Detective (later Inspector) Joseph Cardona, a key character in many Shadow novels.

In contrast to the pulps, &quot;The Shadow&quot; radio drama limited the cast of major characters to The Shadow, Commissioner Weston, and Margo Lane, the last of whom was created for the radio series. Along with giving The Shadow a love interest, Margo was created because it was believed that including Harry Vincent as a regular would mean an overabundance of male characters (considering the criminals in the stories were usually male, too) and could possibly make it difficult for the audience to distinguish between the voices of so many male actors. The radio script for &quot;The Death House Rescue&quot; (reprinted in &quot;The Shadow Scrapbook&quot;) features Harry Vincent, but he did not appear in the actual radio broadcast or any episode of the radio drama series. Clyde Burke made occasional appearances, but not as an agent of The Shadow. Lieutenant Cardona was a minor character in several episodes. Moe Shrevnitz (identified only as &quot;Shrevvy&quot;) made several appearances as a simple-minded acquaintance of Cranston and Lane who sometimes acted as their chauffeur, unaware Cranston was actually The Shadow.

===Enemies===
The Shadow also faces a wide variety of enemies, ranging from kingpins and mad scientists to international spies.

Among his recurring foes are:
* Shiwan Khan – A would-be conqueror who is the last living descendant of Genghis Khan. Seen in &quot;The Golden Master&quot;, &quot;Shiwan Khan Returns&quot;, &quot;The Invincible Shiwan Khan&quot; and &quot;Masters of Death&quot;. In the 1994 film, he was portrayed by actor John Lone.
* Dr. Rodil Moquino – A doctor and self-proclaimed Voodoo Master who uses hypnosis to make people do his bidding. Seen in &quot;The Voodoo Master&quot;, &quot;The City of Doom&quot; and &quot;Voodoo Trail&quot;.
* Wasp – Basil Gannaford is a criminal mastermind with a bulbous head on a tall frail body whose grasp contained an electric sting and spoke in a buzzing voice. Seen in &quot;The Wasp&quot; and &quot;The Wasp Returns&quot;.
* Benedict Stark – The self-described Prince of Evil. Seen in &quot;The Prince of Evil&quot;, &quot;The Murder Genius&quot;, &quot;The Man Who Died Twice&quot; and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Paymaster&quot;, all written by Theodore Tinsley

The only recurring criminal organization he fought was the Hand (&quot;The Hand&quot;, &quot;Murder for Sale&quot;, &quot;Chicago Crime&quot;, &quot;Crime Rides the Sea&quot; and &quot;Realm of Doom&quot;), where he defeated one Finger of the organization in each book.

In addition, the villain King Kauger from the Shadow story &quot;Wizard of Crime&quot; is the unseen mastermind behind the events of &quot;Intimidation, Inc.&quot;, and the organization known as &quot;The Silent Seven&quot; was referenced in the previous title &quot;The Death Tower&quot;.

Villains Diamond Bert Farwell, Isaac Coffran, Steve Cronin, Spotter, and Birdie Crull all originated in the first two pulps and returned at least once.

The series featured a myriad of one-shot villains including: The Golden Vulture, Malmordo, The Red Blot, The Black Falcon, The Cobra, Five-Face, Li Hoang, Velma Thane, Quetzal, Judge Lawless, The Gray Ghost, The Silver Skull, Gaspard Zemba, Thade the Death Giver, Kwa the Living Joss, Mox, and The Green Terror.

In addition to The Hand and The Silent Seven, The Shadow also battled other one-shot collectives of criminals, including The Hydra, The Green Hoods, The White Skulls, The Five Chameleons, and The Salamanders.

==Radio program==
In early 1930, Street &amp; Smith hired David Chrisman and Bill Sweets to adapt the &quot;Detective Story Magazine&quot; to radio format. Chrisman and Sweets thought the program should be introduced by a mysterious storyteller. A young scriptwriter, Harry Charlot, suggested the name of &quot;The Shadow&quot;. Thus, &quot;The Shadow&quot; premiered over CBS airwaves on July 31, 1930, as the host of the &quot;Detective Story Hour&quot;, narrating &quot;tales of mystery and suspense from the pages of the premier detective fiction magazine&quot;. The bulk of the radio show was written primarily by Sidney Slon. The narrator was first voiced by James La Curto, but became a national sensation when radio veteran Frank Readick, Jr. assumed the role and gave it &quot;a hauntingly sibilant quality that thrilled radio listeners&quot;.

===Early years===

Following a brief tenure as narrator of Street &amp; Smith&#x27;s &quot;Detective Story Hour&quot;, &quot;The Shadow&quot; character was used to host segments of &quot;The Blue Coal Radio Revue&quot;, airing on Sundays at 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. This marked the beginning of a long association between the radio persona and sponsor Blue Coal.

While functioning as a narrator of &quot;The Blue Coal Radio Revue&quot;, the character was recycled by Street &amp; Smith in October 1931, for its newly created &quot;Love Story Hour&quot;. Contrary to dozens of encyclopedias, published reference guides, and even Walter Gibson himself, The Shadow never served as narrator of &quot;Love Story Hour&quot;. He appeared only in advertisements for &quot;The Shadow Magazine&quot; at the end of each episode.

In October 1932, the radio persona temporarily moved to NBC. Frank Readick Jr. again played the role of the sinister-voiced host on Mondays and Wednesdays, both at 6:30 p.m., with La Curto taking occasional turns as the title character.

Readick returned as The Shadow to host a final CBS mystery anthology that fall. The series disappeared from CBS airwaves on March 27, 1935, due to Street &amp; Smith&#x27;s insistence that the radio storyteller be completely replaced by the master crime-fighter described in Walter B. Gibson&#x27;s ongoing pulps.

===Radio drama===

Street &amp; Smith entered into a new broadcasting agreement with Blue Coal in 1937, and that summer Gibson teamed with scriptwriter Edward Hale Bierstadt to develop the new series. &quot;The Shadow&quot; returned to network airwaves with the episode &quot;The Death House Rescue&quot; on September 26, 1937, over the Mutual Broadcasting System. Thus began the &quot;official&quot; radio drama, with 22-year-old Orson Welles starring as Lamont Cranston, a &quot;wealthy young man about town.&quot; Once &quot;The Shadow&quot; joined Mutual as a half-hour series on Sunday evenings, the program was broadcast by Mutual until December 26, 1954.

Welles did not speak the signature line, &quot;Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men?&quot; Instead, Readick did, using a water glass next to his mouth for the echo effect. The famous catchphrase was accompanied by the strains of an excerpt from Opus 31 of the Camille Saint-Saëns classical composition, &quot;Le Rouet d&#x27;Omphale.&quot;

In the debut episode &quot;The Death House Rescue,&quot; Cranston explains he spent years studying in London, Paris, Vienna, Egypt, China, and India, learning different fields of science as well as &quot;the old mysteries that modern science has not yet rediscovered, the natural magic that modern psychology is beginning to understand.&quot; He states his hypnotic and seemingly telepathic abilities are not magic but based on scientific secrets most of the world has forgotten or does not yet understand. In &quot;The Temple Bells of Neban&quot; in 1937, he specifies that a Yogi priest, &quot;Keeper of the Temple of Cobras&quot; in Delhi, taught him how to be invisible by &quot;clouding&quot; peoples&#x27; minds. He indicates in &quot;The Death House Rescue&quot; that he always intended to use his acquired knowledge to secretly fight evil forces that evaded conventional authorities. In the same episode, when his companion Margo Lane suggests he work openly with the police, Cranston implies the police and general public would not understand or approve of his strange methods and abilities, concluding he is only effective by working outside of the law. The radio version of The Shadow is less ruthless than his pulp counterpart, preferring to capture his foes more often than gun them down. He sometimes openly shows compassion for his enemies, even at time criticizing society for creating circumstances that lead to certain crimes and cause some people to lose hope and support.

After Welles departed the show in 1938, Bill Johnstone was chosen to replace him and voiced the character for five seasons. Following Johnstone&#x27;s departure, The Shadow was portrayed by such actors as Bret Morrison (the longest tenure, with 10 years total in two separate runs), John Archer, and Steven Courtleigh (the actors were rarely credited).

&quot;The Shadow&quot; also inspired another radio hit, &quot;The Whistler&quot;, with a similarly mysterious narrator.

===Margo Lane===

The radio drama also introduced Margo Lane (played by Agnes Moorehead, among others) as Cranston&#x27;s love interest, crime-solving partner, and the only person who knows his identity as The Shadow. Described as Cranston&#x27;s &quot;friend and companion&quot; in many episodes, the exact nature of their relationship was not explicitly stated, but Margo mentions in the first episode that she loves him and hopes he will retire The Shadow identity and operate without secrecy if the police really need his help. Four years after the radio show began, the character was introduced into the pulp novels as one of The Shadow&#x27;s agents. Her sudden, unexplained appearance in the pulps annoyed readers and generated a flurry of hate mail printed on &quot;The Shadow Magazine&#x27;s&quot; letters page.

In early scripts of the radio drama, the character&#x27;s name was spelled &quot;Margot.&quot; The name itself was originally inspired by Margot Stevenson, the Broadway ingénue who would later be chosen to voice Lane opposite Welles&#x27;s The Shadow during &quot;the 1938 Goodrich summer season of the radio drama.&quot; In the 1994 film in which Penelope Ann Miller played the character, Margo is portrayed as telepathic, making her aware of and able to counter The Shadow&#x27;s mental abilities.

===Radio drama LPs and CDs===
In 1968, Metro Record&#x27;s &quot;Leo the Lion&quot; label released an LP titled &quot;The Official Adventures of The Shadow&quot; (CH-1048) with two original 15-minute radio-style productions written by John Fleming: &quot;The Computer Calculates, but The Shadow Knows&quot; and &quot;Air Freight Fracas.&quot; Bret Morrison, Grace Matthews, and Santos Ortega reprised their roles as Cranston/The Shadow, Margo Lane, and Commissioner Weston. Ken Roberts also returned as the announcer. 
Throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, dozens of LPs appeared in print from other record labels featuring recordings taken from the original broadcast Shadow radio show dramas. With the advent of the compact disc, more of the radio shows were commercially released.

==Comic strip==
&quot;The Shadow&quot; has been adapted for comics a number of times during his long history; his first was on June 17, 1940, as a syndicated daily newspaper comic strip offered through the Ledger Syndicate. The strip&#x27;s story continuity was written by Walter B. Gibson, with plot lines adapted from the Shadow pulps, and the strip was illustrated by Vernon Greene.

The comic strip, which ran until June 20, 1942, comprised 14 stories, the last of which was left uncompleted when the strip was canceled:

# Mystery of the Sealed Box (June 17 – Aug 10, 1940)
# The Shadow in His Sanctum (Aug 12 – Sept 21, 1940)
# The Shadow vs. Hoang Hu (Sept 23 – Nov 2, 1940)
# The Shadow on Shark Island (Nov 4, 1940 – Jan 25, 1941)
# The Shadow vs. the Bund (Jan 27 – April 19, 1941)
# The Shadow vs. Shiwan Khan (April 21 – July 26, 1941)
# The Darvin Fortune (July 28 – Oct 11, 1941)
# The Adele Varne Mystery (Oct 13 – Nov 22, 1941)
# The Shadow and Professor Scorpio (Nov 24 – Dec 13, 1941)
# The Shadow and the Gray Ghost (Dec 15, 1941 – Jan 10, 1942)
# The Star of Delhi (Jan 12 – Jan 31, 1942)
# The Earthquake Machines (Feb 2 – March 28, 1942)
# The Return of Althor (March 30 – May 23, 1942)
# The Cliff Castle Mystery (May 25 – June 20, 1942)

&quot;The Shadow&quot; daily strip was collected decades later in two comic book series from two different publishers (see below), first in 1988 and then again in 1999.

===History===
====1940s-1960s====

To both cross-promote &quot;The Shadow&quot; and attract a younger audience to its other pulp magazines, Street &amp; Smith published 101 issues of the comic book &quot;Shadow Comics&quot; from Vol. 1, #1 – Vol. 9, #5 (March 1940 – Sept. 1949). A Shadow story led off each issue, with the remainder of the stories being strips based on other Street &amp; Smith pulp heroes.

In &quot;Mad&quot; #4 (April–May 1953), &quot;The Shadow&quot; was spoofed by Harvey Kurtzman and Will Elder with a character called &quot;The Shadow&#x27;&quot; (with an apostrophe), which is short for &quot;Lamont Shadowskeedeeboomboom&quot;. This story was reprinted in &quot;The Brothers Mad&quot; (ibooks, New York, 2002, ). The charcer returned in &quot;Mad&quot; #14 (August 1954) to guest-star in &quot;Manduck the Magician&quot;, a spoof by Harvey Kurtzman and Will Elder of the &quot;Mandrake the Magician&quot; comic strip. This story was reprinted in &quot;Mad Strikes Back!&quot; (ibooks, New York, 2002, ).

During the superhero revival of the 1960s, Archie Comics published an eight-issue series, &quot;The Shadow&quot; (Aug. 1964 – Sept. 1965), under the company&#x27;s Mighty Comics imprint. In the first issue, The Shadow was loosely based on the radio version, but with blond hair. In issue #2 (Sept. 1964), the character changed into a campy, heavily muscled superhero in a green and blue costume by writer Robert Bernstein and artist John Rosenberger. Later issues of this eight-issue series were written by Superman co-creator Jerry Siegel. The change was not well received. &quot;Totally at odds with everything that personified the classic Shadow,&quot; &quot;American Comic Book Chronicles&quot; says, &quot;Archie&#x27;s incarnation is still regarded in many quarters as one of the greatest comic book misfires of the 1960s.&quot;
====1970s====
Starting in 1973, DC Comics published an &quot;atmospheric interpretation&quot; of the character by writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil and artist Michael Kaluta in a 12-issue series (Nov. 1973 – Sept. 1975) attempting to be faithful to both the pulp-magazine character and radio-drama character. Kaluta drew issues 1–4 and 6 and was followed by Frank Robbins and then E. R. Cruz. Fellow pulp fiction hero the Avenger guest-starred in issue #11. The Shadow also appeared in DC&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; #253 (Nov. 1973), in which Batman teams with an aging Shadow and calls the famous crime fighter his &quot;biggest inspiration.&quot; In &quot;Batman&quot; #259 (Nov.–Dec. 1974), Batman again meets The Shadow, and we learn that, in the past, The Shadow had saved Bruce Wayne&#x27;s life when the latter was a boy and that The Shadow knows Batman&#x27;s secret identity (he assures Batman, however, that his secret is safe with him). The Shadow is also referenced in DC&#x27;s &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #446 (1975), page 4, panel 2: Batman, out of costume and in disguise as an older night janitor, makes a crime fighting acknowledgement, in a thought balloon, to the Shadow.
====1980s====
In 1986, another DC adaptation was developed by Howard Chaykin. This four-issue miniseries, &quot;The Shadow: Blood and Judgement&quot;, brought The Shadow to modern-day New York. While initially successful, this version proved unpopular with traditional Shadow fans because it depicted The Shadow using two Uzi submachine guns, as well as featuring a strong strain of black comedy and extreme violence throughout.

&quot;The Shadow&quot;, set in the then-current day, was continued in 1987 as a monthly DC comics series by writer Andy Helfer (editor of the miniseries); it was drawn primarily by artists Bill Sienkiewicz (issues 1–6) and Kyle Baker (issues 8–19 and the second of two &quot;Shadow Annual&quot;s, the first having been drawn by Joe Orlando).

In 1988, O&#x27;Neil and Kaluta, with inker Russ Heath, returned to The Shadow with the Marvel Comics graphic novel &quot;The Shadow: Hitler&#x27;s Astrologer&quot;, set during World War II. This one-shot appeared in both hardcover and trade paperback editions.

The Vernon Greene/Walter Gibson Shadow newspaper comic strip from the early 1940s was collected by Malibu Graphics (Malibu Comics) under its Eternity Comics imprint, beginning with the first issue of &quot;Crime Classics&quot; dated July 1988. Each cover was illustrated by Greene and colored by one of Eternity&#x27;s colorists. A total of 13 issues appeared featuring just the black-and-white daily until the final issue, dated November 1989. Some of the Shadow storylines were contained in one issue, while others were continued over into the next. When a Shadow story ended, another tale would begin in the same issue. This back-to-back format continued until the final issue (#13).

Dave Stevens&#x27; nostalgic comics series &quot;The Rocketeer&quot; contains a number of pop culture references to the 1930s. Various characters from the Shadow pulps make appearances in the storyline published in the &quot;Rocketeer Adventure Magazine&quot;, including The Shadow&#x27;s famous alter ego Lamont Cranston. Two issues were published by in 1988 and 1989, but the third and final installment did not appear until years later, finally appearing in 1995 from Dark Horse Comics. All three issues were then collected by Dark Horse into a slick trade paperback titled &quot;The Rocketeer: Cliff&#x27;s New York Adventure&quot; ().

In 1989, DC released a hardcover graphic collection reprinting five issues (#1–4 and 6 by Dennis O&#x27;Neil and Michael Kaluta) of their 1970s series as &quot;The Private Files of The Shadow&quot;. The volume also featured &quot;In the Toils of Wing Fat&quot;, a new Shadow adventure drawn by Kaluta.
====1990s====
From 1989 to 1992, DC published a new Shadow comic book series, &quot;The Shadow Strikes!&quot;, written by Gerard Jones and Eduardo Barreto. This series was set in the 1930s and returned The Shadow to his pulp origins. During its run, it featured The Shadow&#x27;s first-ever team-up with Doc Savage, another popular hero of the pulp magazine era. The two characters appeared together in a four-issue story that crossed back and forth between each character&#x27;s DC comic book series. &quot;The Shadow Strikes&quot; often led The Shadow into encounters with well-known celebrities of the 1930s, such as Albert Einstein, Amelia Earhart, Charles Lindbergh, union organizer John L. Lewis, and Chicago gangsters Frank Nitti and Jake Guzik. In issue #7, The Shadow meets a radio announcer named Grover Mills, a character based on the young Orson Welles, who has been impersonating The Shadow on the radio. The character&#x27;s name is taken from Grover&#x27;s Mill, New Jersey, the name of the small town where the Martians land in Welles&#x27;s 1938 radio broadcast of &quot;The War of the Worlds.&quot; When Shadow rights holder Condé Nast increased its licensing fee, DC concluded the series after 31 issues and one &quot;Annual&quot;; it became the longest-running Shadow comic book series since Street &amp; Smith&#x27;s original 1940s series.

During the early-to-mid-1990s, Dark Horse Comics acquired the rights to The Shadow from Condé Nast. It published the Shadow miniseries &quot;The Shadow: In the Coils of Leviathan&quot; (four issues) in 1993, and &quot;The Shadow: Hell&#x27;s Heat Wave&quot; (three issues) in 1995. &quot;In the Coils of Leviathan&quot; was later collected by Dark Horse in 1994 as a trade paperback. Both series were written by Joel Goss and Michael Kaluta and drawn by Gary Gianni. A one-shot issue, &quot;The Shadow and the Mysterious Three&quot;, was published by Dark Horse in 1994, again written by Joel Goss and Michael Kaluta, with Stan Manoukian and Vince Roucher taking over the illustration duties but working from Kaluta&#x27;s layouts. A comics adaptation of the 1994 film &quot;The Shadow&quot; was published in two issues by Dark Horse as part of the movie&#x27;s merchandising campaign. The script was by Goss and Kaluta and drawn by Kaluta. It was collected and published in England by Boxtree as a graphic novel tie-in for the film&#x27;s British release. Emulating DC&#x27;s earlier team-up, Dark Horse also published a two-issue miniseries in 1995 called &quot;The Shadow and Doc Savage: The Case of the Shrieking Skeletons&quot;. It was written by Steve Vance and illustrated by Manoukian and Roucher. Both issues&#x27; covers were drawn by Rocketeer creator Dave Stevens. A final Dark Horse Shadow team-up was published in 1995: another one-shot issue, &quot;Ghost and The Shadow&quot;, written by Doug Moench, pencilled by H. M. Baker, and inked by Bernard Kolle. It was set in modern times.

The Shadow made an uncredited cameo in issue #2 of DC&#x27;s 1996 four-issue miniseries &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, re-released as a trade paperback in 1997. The Shadow appears in the nightclub scene standing in the background next to the Question and Rorschach.

The early 1940s Shadow newspaper daily strip was reprinted by Avalon Communications under its ACG Classix imprint. The Shadow daily began appearing in the first issue of &quot;Pulp Action&quot; comics. It carried no monthly date or issue number on the cover, only a 1999 copyright and a &quot;Pulp Action&quot; #1 notation at the bottom of the inside cover. Each issue&#x27;s cover is a colorized panel blow-up, taken from one of the reprinted strips. The eighth issue uses for its cover a Shadow serial black-and-white film still, with several hand-drawn alterations. The first issue of &quot;Pulp Action&quot; is devoted entirely to reprinting the Shadow daily, but subsequent issues began offering back-up stories not involving The Shadow in every issue. These Shadow strip reprints stopped with &quot;Pulp Action&quot;″s eighth issue, before the story was complete. Here are the strip&#x27;s reprinted storylines (the last issue carries a 2000 copyright date):

Pulp Action&#x27;
1, &quot;Riddle of the Sealed Box&quot;; 
2, &quot;Mystery of the Sleeping Gas&quot;; 
3 and 4, &quot;The Shadow vs. the Swindlers&quot;; 
5 and 6, &quot;The Shadow and the Adele Varne Mystery&quot;;
7 and 8, &quot;The Shadow and the Darvin Fortune&quot;.
====21st century====
In August 2011, Dynamite licensed &quot;The Shadow&quot; from Condé Nast for an ongoing comic book series and several miniseries. Its first on-going series was written by Garth Ennis and illustrated by Aaron Campbell; it debuted on April 19, 2012. This series ran for 26 issues; the regular series ended in May 2014, but a prologue issue #0 was published in July 2014. Dynamite followed with the release of an eight-issue miniseries, &quot;Masks&quot;, teaming the 1930s Shadow with Dynamite&#x27;s other pulp hero comic book adaptations, the Spider, the Green Hornet and Kato, and a 1930s Zorro, plus four other heroes of the pulp era from Dynamite&#x27;s comics lineup. Dynamite offered a 10-issue Shadow miniseries, &quot;The Shadow: Year One&quot;, followed by the team-up five-issue miniseries, &quot;The Shadow/Green Hornet: Dark Nights&quot;, and a Shadow six-issue miniseries set in the modern era, &quot;The Shadow: Now&quot;. In August 2015, Dynamite Entertainment launched volume 2 of &quot;The Shadow&quot;, a new ongoing series written by Cullen Bunn and drawn by Giovanni Timpano.

==Films==

The Shadow character has been adapted for film shorts and films.

===Shadow film shorts (1931–1932)===
In 1931 and 1932, Bryan Foy Productions created and Universal Pictures distributed a series of six film shorts based on the popular &quot;Detective Story Hour&quot; radio program, narrated by The Shadow. The shorts featured the voice of Frank Readick Jr., who portrayed The Shadow on the radio program. The six films are: &quot;A Burglar to the Rescue&quot; (© July 22, 1931), &quot;Trapped&quot; (© Sep. 21, 1931), &quot;Sealed Lips&quot; (© Oct. 30, 1931), &quot;House of Mystery&quot; (© Dec. 11, 1931), &quot;The Red Shadow&quot; (© Jan. 12, 1932), and &quot;The Circus Show-Up&quot; (© Jan. 27, 1932).

===&quot;The Shadow Strikes&quot; (1937)===
The film &quot;The Shadow Strikes&quot; was released in 1937, starring Rod La Rocque in the title role. Lamont Granston (as his name was spelled in both opening credits and a newspaper article) assumes the secret identity of &quot;The Shadow&quot; in order to thwart an attempted robbery at an attorney&#x27;s office. Both &quot;The Shadow Strikes&quot; (1937) and its sequel, &quot;International Crime&quot; (1938), were released by Grand National Pictures.

===&quot;International Crime&quot; (1938)===
La Rocque returned the following year in &quot;International Crime&quot;. In this version, reporter Lamont Cranston (despite being spelled Granston in the previous film) is an amateur criminologist and detective who uses the name of &quot;The Shadow&quot; as a radio gimmick. Thomas Jackson portrayed Police Commissioner Weston, and Astrid Allwyn was cast as Phoebe Lane, Cranston&#x27;s assistant.

===&quot;The Shadow&quot; (1940)===
&quot;The Shadow&quot;, a 15-chapter movie serial, produced by Columbia Pictures and starring Victor Jory, premiered in theaters in 1940. The serial&#x27;s villain, The Black Tiger, is a criminal mastermind who sabotages rail lines and factories across the United States. Lamont Cranston must become his shadowy alter ego in order to unmask the criminal and halt his fiendish crime spree. As The Shadow, Jory wears an all-black suit and cloak, as well as a black bandana that helps conceal his facial features.

===&quot;The Shadow Returns&quot;, &quot;Behind the Mask&quot;, and &quot;Missing Lady&quot; (1946)===
Low-budget motion picture studio Monogram Pictures produced a trio of quickie Shadow B-movie features in 1946 starring Kane Richmond: &quot;The Shadow Returns&quot; (© Jan. 31, 1946), &quot;Behind the Mask&quot; (© April 1, 1946) and &quot;The Missing Lady&quot; (© July 20, 1946). Richmond&#x27;s Shadow wore all black, including a trench coat, a wide-brimmed fedora, and a full face-mask similar to the type worn by movie serial hero The Masked Marvel, instead of the character&#x27;s signature black cape with red lining and red scarf.

===&quot;Invisible Avenger&quot; (1958)===
Episodes of a television pilot shot in 1957 were edited into the 1958 theatrical feature &quot;Invisible Avenger&quot;, rereleased in 1962 as &quot;Bourbon Street Shadows&quot;.

===&quot;The Shadow&quot; (1994)===
In 1994 the character was adapted once again into a feature film, &quot;The Shadow,&quot; starring Alec Baldwin as Lamont Cranston and Penelope Ann Miller as Margo Lane, with John Lone playing the recurring Asian villain from the pulp series Shiwan Khan, who claims to be a direct descendant of Genghis Khan. As the film opens, Cranston has become the evil and corrupt Yin-Ko (literally &quot;Dark Eagle&quot;), a brutal warlord and opium smuggler in early 1930s Mongolia. Yin-Ko is kidnapped by agents of the mysterious holy man Tulku, who knows the warlord is really Lamont Cranston of New York. He says he is determined to reform the man, that since Cranston knows the evil that lurks in his own heart he will be effective in knowing and fighting such evil in other men, and will learn how to tap into his latent psychic power. Resistant at first, Cranston accepts that is now under the Tulku&#x27;s control. Over time, he reforms and learns how to read thoughts, as well as how to &quot;cloud men&#x27;s minds&quot; to alter their perception and make himself invisible. Cranston eventually returns to his native New York City and takes up the guise of the mysterious crime fighter &quot;The Shadow,&quot; in payment to humanity for his past evil misdeeds: &quot;Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow &quot;knows&quot; ...&quot;

The Shadow has a network of agents, each of whom now wears a ring similar to his own, and is then joined by Margo Lane, a socialite born with the gift of telepathy herself who quickly discovers Cranston&#x27;s identity. In the film, the evil Shiwan Khan is an admirer of Ying-Ko who later also becomes a student of the Tulku, learning the same powers of illusion and telepathy but never reforming or regretting his murderous ways. He seeks to finish his ancestor&#x27;s legacy of conquering the world by first destroying New York City, using a newly developed atomic bomb as a show of his power. Khan nearly succeeds, but is thwarted by The Shadow. In a final psychic duel, the hero telekinetically hurls a shattered piece of mirror directly into the villain&#x27;s forehead, instantly rendering him unconscious. Shiwan Khan is not killed and wakes up in an unidentified asylum where he is now under the care of a doctor who is secretly one of The Shadow&#x27;s agents. Due to his head injury, surgery was performed on his frontal lobe, removing his telepathic powers and forcing him to remain imprisoned in the asylum.

The film combines elements from The Shadow pulp novels and comic books with the aforementioned ability to cloud minds described only on the radio show. In the film Alec Baldwin, as The Shadow, wears a black cloak and a long red scarf that covers his mouth and chin; he also wears a black, double-breasted trench coat and a wide-brimmed, black slouch hat. Contrarily to pulp novels, he is armed with a pair of modified M1911 .45-caliber semi-automatic pistols that for the film have longer barrels, are nickel plated, and have ivory grips. In reality, the prop guns were modified LAR Grizzly Win Mags nicknamed &quot;Silver Heat.&quot; The film also displays a first: Cranston&#x27;s ability to conjure the illusion of a false face whenever he is in his guise as The Shadow, giving him an appearance similar to the character&#x27;s physical portrayal in the pulp magazines and comics.

The film was financially and critically unsuccessful.

===Unmade Sam Raimi &quot;Shadow&quot; feature film===
On December 11, 2006, the website SuperHero Hype reported that director Sam Raimi and Michael Uslan would co-produce a new &quot;Shadow&quot; film for Columbia Pictures. It was rumored to also be a film involving several Street and Smith pulp heroes, including The Shadow, the Avenger, and Doc Savage. This screenplay was supposedly written by Siavash Farahani.

On October 16, 2007, Raimi stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t have any news on &quot;The Shadow&quot; at this time, except that the company that I have with Josh Donen, my producing partner, we&#x27;ve got the rights to &quot;The Shadow.&quot; I love the character very much and we&#x27;re trying to work on a story that&#x27;ll do justice to the character&quot;.

On August 23, 2012, the website ShadowFan reported that during a Q&amp;A session at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, director Sam Raimi, when asked about the status of his Shadow film project, stated they had not been able to develop a good script and the film would not be produced as planned.

==Game adaptations==
Ocean Software developed a video game version of &quot;The Shadow&quot; to tie in with the 1994 film. The game was supposed to be published on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, but after the low box office gross of the film, the game was never released despite being completed. Since then, a ROM of the game has been leaked online. 

Bally released a pinball machine based on &quot;The Shadow&quot; in 1994. The game was designed by Brian Eddy, and maintains modern popularity due to its clever use of mechanical features like the Phurba diverters, satisfying shot design, and unique upper playfield feature.

There is also a Tiger handheld game as well.

==Television==
Two attempts were made to adapt the character to television. The first, in 1954, was titled &quot;The Shadow&quot; and starred Tom Helmore as Lamont Cranston.

The second attempt in 1958 was titled &quot;The Invisible Avenger&quot;; it never aired. The two episodes produced were compiled into a theatrical film and released with the same title. It was re-released with additional footage in 1962 as &quot;Bourbon Street Shadows&quot;. Starring Richard Derr as The Shadow, the film depicts Lamont Cranston investigating the murder of a New Orleans bandleader. The film is notable as the second directorial effort of James Wong Howe, who directed only one of the two unaired episodes.

==Influence on superheroes and other media==
When Bob Kane and Bill Finger first developed Bat-Man, they patterned the character after pulp mystery men such as The Shadow. Finger then used &quot;Partners of Peril&quot;a Shadow pulp written by Theodore Tinsleyas the basis for Batman&#x27;s debut story, &quot;The Case of the Chemical Syndicate&quot;. Finger later publicly acknowledged that &quot;my first Batman script was a takeoff on a Shadow story&quot; and that &quot;Batman was originally written in the style of the pulps.&quot; This influence was further evident with Batman showing little remorse over killing or maiming criminals and not above using firearms. Decades later, noted comic book writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil would have Batman and The Shadow meet in &quot;Batman&quot; #253 (November 1973) and &quot;Batman&quot; #259 (December 1974) to solve crimes. In the former, Batman acknowledged that The Shadow was his biggest influence and in the latter, The Shadow reveals to Batman that he knows his true identity of Bruce Wayne but assures him that his secret is safe with him.

Alan Moore has credited The Shadow as one of the key influences for the creation of V, the title character in his DC Comics miniseries &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, which later became a Warner Bros. feature film released in 2006.
The Shadow is also one of the inspirations for Disney&#x27;s 1991–1992 cartoon series &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot;.

The 2015 video game &quot;Fallout 4&quot; includes a quest series centered on a character called &quot;the Silver Shroud,&quot; a crime-fighting detective from old-world radio shows.

The Lamont Cranston Band takes its name from The Shadow&#x27;s alter ego.

<text>Dragnet is an American media franchise created by actor and producer Jack Webb and owned by his company Mark VII Limited and Universal Pictures. It follows Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Detective Joe Friday and his partners as they conduct by-the-book police work and solve crimes in Los Angeles. Originating as a radio drama on NBC in 1949, &quot;Dragnet&quot; has been adapted into several successful television shows and films, though the franchise&#x27;s popularity has reduced since Webb&#x27;s death in 1982. Its name is derived from the police term &quot;dragnet&quot;, a system of coordinated measures for apprehending criminals or suspects.

&quot;Dragnet&quot; is perhaps the most famous and influential police procedural crime drama in American media history. Webb&#x27;s aims in &quot;Dragnet&quot; were for unpretentious acting and a realistic depiction of policing. The series portrayed police work as dangerous and heroic, and helped shape public perception of law enforcement in the 20th century, improving the public&#x27;s opinion of police officers.

&quot;Dragnet&quot; remains a key influence on the police procedural genre. Its cultural impact is such that seven decades after its debut, elements of &quot;Dragnet&quot; are familiar to those who are otherwise unfamiliar with the franchise itself:
*&quot;Dragnet&quot;, the four-note introduction to the franchise&#x27;s brass and timpani theme music (though its origins date to Miklós Rózsa&#x27;s score for the 1946 film version of &quot;The Killers&quot;).
*The opening narration common across the franchise&#x27;s series: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen: the story you are about to hear is true. Only the names have been changed to protect the innocent.&quot; Over time, the &quot;only&quot; and &quot;ladies and gentlemen&quot; were eventually dropped. The television version used in the 1950s and 1960s series replaced &quot;hear&quot; with &quot;see&quot; and had a backdrop of Joe Friday&#x27;s badge, number 714.
*&quot;Just the facts, ma&#x27;am&quot;, a catchphrase and misquotation often attributed to Joe Friday and popularly used to reference or evoke &quot;Dragnet&quot;, though Webb&#x27;s portrayal of Joe Friday never said that exact phrase.

==Actual cases==
The opening of &quot;The story you are about to hear is true&quot; is derived from the fact that many works in the franchise are transcribed from official LAPD case files. In some cases, the source material has been identified, including the following:

* &quot;Sullivan Kidnapping – The Wolf&quot; (Radio, 1949) – The 1927 kidnapping and murder of Marion Parker.

* &quot;The Big Thank You&quot; (Radio, 1950) – Louise Peete&#x27;s post-prison years and third murder, which led to her becoming the second of only four women to be executed in the California gas chamber.

* 1969 TV movie – The killing spree of serial killer Harvey Glatman in the late 1950s. Pierce Brooks, an LAPD captain who was involved in Glatman&#x27;s arrest and interrogation, served as a technical advisor for the film.

==Radio==
&quot;Dragnet&quot; began as a radio series, running on the NBC radio network from 1949 to 1957.

==Television==

===1951–1959 original===

In 1951, &quot;Dragnet&quot; shifted to the field of television, running on NBC from 1951 to 1959. Most early episodes of the television series were dubbed or lip-synced adaptations of episodes of the radio show, but later episodes were original plotlines. Most of the cast members were veteran radio actors who could be relied upon to read the matter-of-fact dialogue naturally.

===1967–1970 revival===

Webb relaunched &quot;Dragnet&quot; in 1966, with NBC once again chosen to air the series. He tried to persuade Ben Alexander to rejoin him as Frank Smith. Alexander was then committed to an ABC police series, &quot;Felony Squad&quot;, and the producers would not release him. Webb reluctantly came up with a new character to take the role of Joe Friday&#x27;s partner, calling upon his longtime friend Harry Morgan to play Officer Bill Gannon. Morgan had previously portrayed rooming-house proprietor Luther Gage in the 1949 radio series episode &quot;James Vickers&quot;. George Fenneman returned as the show&#x27;s primary announcer, with John Stephenson replacing Hal Gibney in the role of announcing the trial dates and subsequent punishments for the offenders. Fenneman replaced Stephenson in that role during the fourth season. Unlike the previous &quot;Dragnet&quot; series, the revival was produced and aired in color.

Webb produced a TV movie pilot for the new version of the show for Universal Television, although the pilot was not aired until January 1969. NBC bought the show on the strength of the movie, and it debuted as a midseason replacement for the sitcom &quot;The Hero&quot; on Thursday nights in January 1967. To distinguish it from the original, the year was included in the title of the show (i.e., &quot;Dragnet 1967&quot;). Although Friday had been promoted to lieutenant in the final episode of the 1950s production, Webb chose to have Friday revert to sergeant with his familiar badge, &quot;714&quot;.

When real-life LAPD Sergeant Dan Cooke, Webb&#x27;s contact in the department during production of the revived &quot;Dragnet&quot; series, was promoted to lieutenant, he arranged to carry the same lieutenant&#x27;s badge, number 714, as worn by Joe Friday. Cooke was technical advisor to the KNBC documentary &quot;Police Unit 2A-26&quot;, directed by John Orland. He brought that to the attention of Webb, who hired Orland to direct and film &quot;This is the City&quot;, a series of minidocumentaries about Los Angeles that preceded most TV episodes during the 1969 and 1970 seasons. The show had good ratings on NBC&#x27;s schedule for four seasons (although its popularity at that time did not exceed that of the 1950s version), but the show was canceled after the completion of the 1969-1970 season.

Much as was done 11 years earlier, Webb decided voluntarily to discontinue &quot;Dragnet&quot; after its fourth season to focus on producing and directing his other projects through Mark VII Limited. The first of these projects was titled &quot;Adam-12&quot;, a 30-minute police procedural similar to &quot;Dragnet&quot;, but focusing on patrol officers rather than detectives. The series premiered in the fall of 1968, while &quot;Dragnet 1969&quot; was in production, and ran for seven seasons, coming to an end in 1975. In 1971, with producer Robert A. Cinader, Webb developed another pilot originally intended to be centered around the staff of a Los Angeles–area medical center&#x27;s emergency room. When researching for the pilot, Webb and Cinader were introduced to the Los Angeles County Fire Department&#x27;s fledgling paramedic program, and the premise was reworked to include the Los Angeles County Fire Department, and &quot;Emergency!&quot; was born; running as a weekly series until 1977, and as a series of made-for-television movies for two years after that. &quot;Emergency!&quot; was centered on the then-fictitious Los Angeles County Fire Department paramedic rescue unit, Squad 51.

During the early 1970s, reruns of this version of &quot;Dragnet&quot; were popular on local stations, usually broadcast during the late afternoon or early evenings. From 1991 to 1995, &quot;Dragnet&quot; was shown on Nick at Nite, then moved to its sister cable channel TV Land. From October 1, 2011, to April 26, 2013, the series ran daily on the digital cable channel Antenna TV, and before that, the show aired on the Retro Television Network.

&quot;Dragnet&quot; was broadcast Monday through Friday on Me-TV. The show was part of the &quot;CriMe TV&quot; morning block with &quot;Perry Mason&quot; and &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, with &quot;Dragnet&quot; shown back to back from 11:00 am until 12:00 pm. In December 2014, Me-TV added a third airing of &quot;Dragnet&quot; to its late-night lineup; the series airs at 12:30 am following a second episode of &quot;Perry Mason&quot;. Me-TV ended the run of Dragnet on January 1, 2015, whereupon it became part of Cozi TV&#x27;s regular lineup. In January 2020 &quot;Dragnet&quot; returned to MeTV along with its sibling series &quot;Adam-12&quot; after Cozi TV dropped both series; &quot;Dragnet&quot; currently broadcasts one episode weekday mornings 5:30 a.m.

===Webb&#x27;s later years===
In 1982, Webb had begun working on a revival of &quot;Dragnet&quot;, writing and producing five scripts and continuing his role as Joe Friday. Once again, he needed to create a new character for Friday&#x27;s partner; Ben Alexander had died in 1969 and Harry Morgan was tied up with his commitments to &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, and its already greenlit followup &quot;AfterMASH&quot;. Webb decided on former &quot;Adam-12&quot; star Kent McCord who had several guest appearances early in the 1967 revival series, to fill the undefined role. No indication was given whether McCord would be playing his character of Jim Reed from &quot;Adam-12&quot; or a totally new character. On December 23, 1982, Webb died unexpectedly from a heart attack and the &quot;Dragnet&quot; revival was scrapped.

After Webb&#x27;s death, LAPD Chief Daryl Gates announced that badge number 714—Webb&#x27;s number on the television show—was retired, and Los Angeles city offices lowered their flags to half staff. At Webb&#x27;s funeral, the LAPD provided an honor guard, and the chief of police commented on Webb&#x27;s connection with the LAPD. An LAPD auditorium was named in his honor. Jack Webb&#x27;s LAPD sergeant&#x27;s badge and ID card are on display at the Los Angeles Police Academy.

==Film versions==
===&quot;Dragnet&quot; (1954)===
In 1954, a theatrical feature film titled &quot;Dragnet&quot;, an adaptation of the series, was released with Webb, Alexander, and Richard Boone. Dennis Weaver plays R. A. Lohrman, a detective captain. The film begins with the shooting of small-time hood Miller Starkie (Dub Taylor) on orders from his boss, Max Troy (Stacy Harris). Friday and Smith&#x27;s superior is LAPD Intelligence Division Captain Jim Hamilton (Boone), a department member and the film&#x27;s technical advisor. The Intelligence Division focused on the pursuit of organized-crime figures, and some of Max Troy&#x27;s habits resemble that of Mickey Cohen, the known Los Angeles underworld boss; for example, Troy&#x27;s LAPD file reads that he could be found at &quot;Sunset Strip taverns and joints&quot;, as could Cohen. The film depicts the working relationship between the LAPD and the Los Angeles County District Attorney&#x27;s office; Friday and Smith work to gather evidence that the DA&#x27;s office deems sufficient to gain the indictment and ultimate conviction of Troy and his fellows. One scene contains a violent fist-fight involving the two detectives, with the close-up cinematic technique typical of Webb&#x27;s style of direction. The movie&#x27;s ending represents a departure from most &quot;Dragnet&quot; stories; no arrest is made at the story&#x27;s conclusion. Chester Davitt (Willard Sage), Troy&#x27;s underling and Starkie&#x27;s killer, is killed by underworld figures, and Troy succumbs to cancer before the detectives, having gathered sufficient evidence against him, can make the arrest.

The film earned an estimated $4.7 million at the North American box office during its first year of release.

===&quot;Dragnet&quot; 1966 (aired 1969)===
&quot;Dragnet 1966&quot; is a made-for-TV movie that initiated the return of the &quot;Dragnet&quot; series to television. It was produced as the TV pilot for &quot;Dragnet 1967&quot;, but was not broadcast until 1969. The movie stars Jack Webb as Sgt. Friday and Harry Morgan as Officer Bill Gannon. The story focuses on crime more typical of the 1960s than of the previous &quot;Dragnet&quot; era; the detectives are assigned to find a voyeuristic serial killer similar to Harvey Glatman (played by Vic Perrin, who appeared in the 1954 film as an assistant district attorney). Also appearing is Virginia Gregg, who had a role in the 1954 feature and was a frequent guest actor in the 1951–59 series and the 1967–70 episodes, and John Roseboro, a catcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers, who dabbled in acting in the off season; Roseboro played a plainclothes detective who had been the target of racial slurs by a child molester until Friday came to his aid.

===&quot;Dragnet&quot; (1987)===
In 1987, a comedy film version of &quot;Dragnet&quot; was released starring Dan Aykroyd as the stiff Joe Friday (nephew of the original Sergeant Joe Friday), and Tom Hanks as his partner, Detective Pep Streebeck. The film contrasted the terse, clipped character of Friday, a hero from an earlier age, with the &quot;real world&quot; of Los Angeles in 1987 to broad comedic effect. Apart from Aykroyd&#x27;s spot-on imitation of Webb&#x27;s Joe Friday and Harry Morgan reprising his role of Bill Gannon (now Captain), the film version has few similarities with previous incarnations. This &quot;Dragnet&quot; parody was a hit with audiences, though no sequel was produced. LAPD Lieutenant Dan Cooke, who had served as technical advisor for the Jack Webb series, was also technical advisor for this production.

==Remakes after Webb&#x27;s death==
===&quot;The New Dragnet&quot; (1989)===
A revival of &quot;Dragnet&quot; by The Arthur Company, titled &quot;The New Dragnet&quot;, aired in first-run syndication in tandem with &quot;The New Adam-12&quot;, a revival of the Jack Webb series &quot;Adam-12&quot;. Like &quot;The New Adam-12&quot;, &quot;The New Dragnet&quot; had entirely different characters, music, and presentation compared to the original series, and starred Jeff Osterhage as Detective Vic Daniels, Bernard White as Detective Carl Molina, and Don Stroud as Captain Lussen.

Fifty-two episodes were aired over two seasons. The first season aired from October 24, 1989, to January 21, 1990; the second season aired from April 19, 1990, to September 9, 1990.

===&quot;L.A. Dragnet&quot; (2003)===
In 2003, a &quot;Dragnet&quot; series was produced by Dick Wolf, the producer of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; series and spin-offs. It aired on ABC, and starred Ed O&#x27;Neill as Joe Friday and Ethan Embry as Frank Smith. After a 12-episode season that followed the traditional formula, the format of the series was changed to an ensemble crime drama in an attempt to boost ratings. (The change apparently reflected Webb&#x27;s intentions for the 1980s revival series, with Joe Friday promoted again to Lieutenant and overseeing a pair or group of younger detectives.)

In &quot;L.A. Dragnet&quot;, Friday was promoted to lieutenant with less screen time and Frank Smith was written out, in favor of a younger and ethnically diverse cast played by Eva Longoria, Desmond Harrington, Evan Dexter Parke, and Christina Chang. Roselyn Sanchez was added to the regular cast in a few episodes. With the &quot;Dragnet&quot; formula no longer in place, the program had the feel of a typical procedural drama. It was cancelled five episodes into its second season. Three episodes premiered on USA Network in early 2004, with the final two on the Sleuth channel in 2006. In other countries such as the Netherlands, the show is retitled &quot;Murder Investigation&quot;.

===Music===
The theme from &quot;Dragnet&quot; has been recorded by many artists, achieving popular success. Artists who charted with it include Ray Anthony (1953) and The Art of Noise (1987).

===Nonfiction===
* In 1958, Webb authored &quot;The Badge&quot;, a book containing chapters of true stories told from the view of a patrolman, sergeant, lieutenant, and others. It had a number of photographs and recently was reissued with a foreword by James Ellroy, author of &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;, which features a fictional show, &quot;Badge of Honor&quot;, modeled after &quot;Dragnet&quot;.
* In 2001, Michael J. Hayde wrote &quot;My Name&#x27;s Friday: The Unauthorized But True Story of &quot;Dragnet&quot; and the Films of Jack Webb&quot;, with a foreword by Harry Morgan (Bill Gannon).

===Parodies===
* &quot;The Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, a 1960 cult classic comedy horror film by Roger Corman, features a parody of the traditional &quot;Dragnet&quot; dry, hard-boiled voiceover narration throughout, and in the second half of the film, an onscreen parody of &quot;Dragnet&quot; and Joe Friday&#x27;s robotic stoicism, a police detective named Joe Fink who says in voiceover &quot;My name is Fink. Joe Fink... I&#x27;m a fink&quot;.
* &quot;St. George and the Dragonet&quot;, a 1953 short audio satire by Stan Freberg, was a smash hit reaching number one on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; and the &quot;Cash Box&quot; record charts. In this satire, Freberg used the line &quot;&quot;, which entered popular lexicography as an actual catchphrase from &quot;Dragnet&quot;, despite the line never being used on the show, except for Season Two, Episode Eight (&quot;Big Lease&quot;). Freberg followed &quot;St. George...&quot; with &quot;Little Blue Riding Hood&quot; and &quot;Christmas Dragnet&quot;.
* The 1954 Woody Woodpecker cartoon &quot;Under the Counter Spy&quot; was a parody of &quot;Dragnet&quot;. At the beginning, a narrator says, &quot;The story you are about to see is a big fat lie. No names have been changed to protect anybody!&quot; At the end, a hammer and stamp make the words &quot;THE END&quot;, and the hammerer hits his thumb.
* The 1955, Three Stooges short &quot;Blunder Boys&quot; parodies &quot;Dragnet&quot;. In place of the familiar &quot;Dragnet&quot; theme, the first four notes of &quot;The Song of the Volga Boatmen&quot;, which is in the public domain, is used. At the end of the film, Moe stamps Larry&#x27;s head with a hammer; Larry&#x27;s forehead then reads, &quot;VII 1/2 The End&quot;.
* A 1956 Looney Tunes short, &quot;Rocket Squad&quot;, starred Daffy Duck and Porky Pig as Sgt. Joe Monday and Det. Schmoe Tuesday, respectively. Daffy narrated, giving a running timeline in the manner of Sgt. Friday. This police adventure ends with both officers convicted and imprisoned for false arrest. The opening title reads: &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, the story you are about to see is true. The drawings have been changed to protect the innocent&quot;. Another short, &quot;Tree Cornered Tweety&quot;, featured Tweety imitating the narrator of &quot;Dragnet&quot; as he is being pursued by Sylvester again.
* A segment of the &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; cartoon show called &quot;Bullwinkle&#x27;s Corner&quot;, which featured Bullwinkle Moose in a poetry reading of &quot;Tom, Tom the Piper&#x27;s Son,&quot; parodied &quot;Dragnet&quot;, as Bullwinkle is apprehended in the act of stealing a pig by two detectives who interrogate Bullwinkle using a terse, clipped monotone similar in style to Joe Friday and Frank Smith (&quot;You got a name?&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m Tom, Tom the Piper&#x27;s Son.&quot; &quot;All right, Piperson, what were you going to do with the pig?&quot;).
* A 1968 sketch entitled the &quot;Copper Clapper Caper&quot; during Jack Webb&#x27;s appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. Webb reprised Friday interviewing the equally deadpan victim of a robbery (played by Carson). The details of the crime started with the alliterative &quot;k&quot; or &quot;kl&quot; consonant sound, such as &quot;Claude Cooper, the kleptomaniac from Cleveland.&quot;
* A &quot;Sesame Street&quot; Muppet skit from the early 1970s, &quot;Dragnet&quot; featured Sgt. Thursday and his partner, Ben, searching for a fugitive letter ”W” using a drawing Ben carries with him of the letter; when they do encounter the letter W it disguises itself turning upside down into a letter “M”.
* The final segment of each episode of PBS&#x27;s &quot;Square One&quot; was titled &quot;Mathnet&quot; and opened with the &quot;Dragnet&quot; theme and an arrangement of the lines &quot;The story you&#x27;re about to see is a fib—but it&#x27;s short. The names are made up, but the problems are real.&quot; Each story arc of the show&#x27;s five-season run lasted five daily episodes (one week) and featured detectives Kate Monday (seasons 1–3) or Pat Tuesday (seasons 4–5) and George Ernest Frankly (all five seasons), of the LAPD in the first two of the show&#x27;s five seasons and the New York Police Department in the last three seasons, using mathematics to solve crimes.
* Isaac Air Freight, a Christian sketch comedy troupe, parodied &quot;Dragnet&quot; twice: on their 1978 album &quot;Fun in the Son&quot; (track 11, &quot;Jerusalem Dragnet&quot;) and 1980 album &quot;Foolish Guy to Confound the Wise&quot; (track 8, &quot;Jerusalem Dragnet II&quot;).
* In 1983, &quot;Prog #310&quot; of UK sci-fi comic &quot;2000AD&quot; featured a time-travelling parody of &quot;Dragnet&quot; in the story &quot;Chrono Cops&quot;, written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Dave Gibbons. In five pages, &quot;Joe Saturday&quot; and &quot;Ed Thursday&quot; encounter several time-travel &quot;tropes&quot;, including a character attempting to kill his own great-grandfather.
* The season-five episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; titled &quot;Marge on the Lam&quot; centers around Marge Simpson and neighbor Ruth Powers being pursued by police while illegally driving Ruth&#x27;s ex-husband&#x27;s car; the episode ends with a &quot;Dragnet&quot;-style epilogue detailing the characters&#x27; fates, as narrated by original series announcer George Fenneman, then the end credits run over a graphic of a police badge while a version of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; theme done in the style of the famous &quot;Dragnet March&quot; plays. Also, the season-seven episode &quot;Mother Simpson&quot; has Homer Simpson&#x27;s mother, Mona Simpson, as a fugitive from Charles Montgomery Burns, who is about to be captured after 27 years. Burns is helped by officers Joe Friday and Bill Gannon (voiced by Harry Morgan).
* &quot;Dragnet&quot; is parodied at the end of the episode of &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; titled: &quot;Sorry, Wrong Slusher&quot;. Winnie-the-Pooh performs a closing narration as a mug shot of Christopher Robin is shown on screen, in the style of &quot;Dragnet&quot;.
* The Amazon original series &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot; features a show in the fictional universe where Germany won the Second World War called &quot;American Reich&quot;, shot in the style of &quot;Dragnet&quot;. The show&#x27;s title crawl music is similar to Dragnet, and the title card contains a police badge with a swastika in the center. In keeping with the alternate history, the character equivalent of Friday is a straight-laced Nazi, with catchphrases including &quot;Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein phone call&quot; (&quot;One people, one empire, one phone call.&quot;).
* In the U.S. Acres segment of &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; season six episode &quot;How Now, Stolen Cow?&quot; featuring Orson Pig and Bo Sheep doing their send up of the series right down to the end featuring the results of the trial...!

<text>The 1992 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XVI Olympic Winter Games () and commonly known as Albertville &#x27;92 (Arpitan: &quot;Arbèrtvile &#x27;92&quot;), were a winter multi-sport event held from 8 to 23 February 1992 in and around Albertville, France. Albertville won the bid to host the Winter Olympics in 1986, beating Sofia, Falun, Lillehammer, Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, Anchorage, and Berchtesgaden. The 1992 Winter Olympics were the last winter games held in the same year as the Summer Olympics. The Games were the fifth Olympic Games held in France and the country&#x27;s third Winter Olympics, after the 1924 Winter Games in Chamonix and the 1968 Winter Games in Grenoble. This games was the first of two consecutive Olympic games to be held in Western Europe, preceding the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.

18 events in Figure skating, short track speed skating, speed skating, and the opening and closing ceremonies took place in Albertville. The 39 other events were held in the nearby 9 villages and resorts around Savoie: Courchevel, La Plagne, Les Arcs, Les Menuires, Les Saisies, Méribel, Pralognan-la-Vanoise, Tignes, and Val d&#x27;Isère. Sixty-four National Olympic Committees and 1,801 athletes participated in six sports and fifty-seven events. This included both the Unified Team, representing the non-Baltic former Soviet republics, and Germany, newly consolidated again as a team following the reunification of the former East and West Germany in 1990. The event also saw the debut of eight nations in the Winter Olympics. The Winter Olympic program has grown this time with the addition of 11 new events. While sports that were already on the program received 5 new events (2 new events in cross-country skiing, at the same time women were allowed to compete in biathlon for the first time and won 3 events exclusive to them.) Another 6 events were added with the implementation of 2 sports that were demonstrated 4 years earlier (freestyle skiing and short track speed skating).These were the last Winter Olympics to include demonstration sports, consisting of curling, aerials and ski ballet, and speed skiing. Due to a rule change implemented in 1986, this was the last edition in the history of the Winter Olympic Games in which all speed skating events were held in an open-air venue.

==Host city selection==

A record-breaking seven locations bid for the games. The non-winning bids were from Anchorage, Berchtesgaden, Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, Falun, Lillehammer, and Sofia. The 91st IOC Session, held in Lausanne on 17 October 1986, voted Albertville the host of the Games.

==Opening ceremony==
==Highlights==
Bjørn Dæhlie and Vegard Ulvang dominated the men&#x27;s cross-country skiing races, both taking home three gold medals with Norway taking a medal sweep in the event. 16-year-old Ski jumper Toni Nieminen became the youngest male gold medalist in a Winter Olympic event until 2002. Petra Kronberger won both the combined event and the slalom of alpine skiing, while Bonnie Blair won both the 500 m and 1000 m speed skating events, and Gunda Niemann took both of the longest races.

Three National Olympic Committees in Asia-Pacific region won their first medals at the Winter Olympics, one in a sport making its debut at the Games (short track speed skating.) Kim Ki-hoon&#x27;s gold medal in 1000 m short track speed skating signified South Korea&#x27;s first medal in the Winter Olympics, while Ye Qiaobo&#x27;s silver medal in women&#x27;s 500 m speed skating represented China&#x27;s first Winter Olympics medal. Annelise Coberger from New Zealand became the first Oceanian athlete to win a medal in women&#x27;s alpine skiing slalom, making her the first athlete from the southern hemisphere to mount the podium at the Winter Games.

Swiss speed skier Nicolas Bochatay died on the penultimate day of the Games, when he crashed into a snow-grooming vehicle during a training run.

==Legacy==
The 1992 Olympic Winter Games marked the last time both the Winter and Summer games were held in the same year. The 1992 Winter Olympics also marked the last time France hosted the Olympics until 2024, when Paris became the second city to host the Summer Olympics three times.

===Cost and cost overrun===
&quot;The Oxford Olympics Study&quot; established the outturn cost of the Albertville 1992 Winter Olympics at US$2.0 billion (in 2015-dollars) and cost overrun at 137% in real terms. This includes sports-related costs only, that is: (i) &quot;operational costs&quot; incurred by the organizing committee to stage the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services; and (ii) &quot;direct capital costs&quot; incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build, e.g., the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which are required to host the Games. Indirect capital costs were not included, e.g. road, rail, or airport infrastructure, or hotel upgrades or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to their staging. In comparison, the cost and cost overrun of the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics were US$2.5 billion and 13%, respectively, while the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics (the most costly Olympics to date) had costs and cost overrun at US$51 billion and 289%, respectively. The average cost for the Winter Games since 1960 is US$3.1 billion, while the average cost overrun is 142%.

== Mascot ==
The 1992 Winter Games mascot, Magique (Magic), was a small imp in the shape of a star and a cube. The mascot was created by Philippe Mairesse and replaced the bid mascot, which was a mountain goat. The star shape symbolized dreams and imagination, while the mascot&#x27;s red and blue colors originated from the French flag.

== Sports==
There were 57 events contested in 6 sports (12 disciplines). See the medal winners, ordered by sport:

===Demonstration sports===
This was the last time demonstration events were included in the Winter Olympics program. Of the 8 events that were under evaluation, 4 received the endorsement to be included in an official form in future editions of the Games (Curling tournaments and the aerials events on the freestyle skiing). The other four events (speed skiing and skiing ballet events on the freestyle skiing) were rejected and have not since returned.

* Curling – Was an official sport in the Olympic program in 1924, after which it was a demonstration sport twice, in 1932 and 1988. There was a possibility of re-inclusion in Lillehammer 1994, but in 1990 the IOC Executive Committee rejected its return as an official sport. The IOC accepted its return in Nagano 1998.
* Freestyle skiing – Like curling, it was a demonstration sport four years previously before becoming part of the official program. Only moguls skiing received this status, while aerials and ballet remained demonstration events. Aerials became an official event two years later, while ballet skiing appeared in the games for the last time, going into a progressive decline and losing its status as a competitive discipline by the International Ski Federation (FIS) in 2000.
* Speed skiing – Considered one of the most dangerous events in the sporting world, the event won a chance to be evaluated by the members of the International Olympic Committee and the FIS, with the possibility of appearing in the program of a future edition. However, this possibility was extinguished when Swiss skier Nicolas Bochatay ran into a snow-grooming vehicle during a training run, dying immediately. According to reports, Bochatay was moving at a speed of more than and was unable to hear the machine&#x27;s warning siren. His death is the subject of several controversies, as speed skiing was not a part of the official program. After this incident, the sport was excluded from any evaluation for future additions to the Olympic program.

==Participating nations==

Sixty-four nations sent competitors to the 1992 Olympics, including seven nations making their first appearance at a Winter Olympics. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, six former-Soviet bloc nations chose to form a Unified Team, while the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania competed as independent nations for the first time since 1936. Czechoslovakia made its last appearance in the Winter Olympics before its dissolution at the end of 1992. United Nations Security Council Resolution 757 took effect on 30 May 1992 (97 days after the closing ceremonies), and Yugoslav athletes were able to participate under their country&#x27;s national symbols. It also suspended the activities of the Yugoslav Olympic Committee, making the country&#x27;s athletes ineligible to compete on the 1992 Summer Olympics. Despite this, some of their athletes classified in individual sports and gained authorization to compete as Independent Olympic Participants (which also happened at the 1992 Summer Paralympics). Yugoslav athletes returned to the Olympic Games in the 1996 Summer Olympics, when only Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo were still part of the country. The 1992 Winter Olympics were the first time since the 1964 Summer Olympics that Germany competed with a unified team. Seven National Olympic Committees sent their first delegations to the Winter Olympics: Algeria, Bermuda, Brazil, Honduras, Ireland, Swaziland, Croatia, and Slovenia (the last two making their first appearances at any Olympics, just a few months after their respective declarations of independence from Yugoslavia). Through the 2022 Winter Olympics, this has been the only participation of Swaziland (now Eswatini) and Honduras in an edition of the Winter Olympics.

<doc id="113359" wikidata="Q1849885" url="?curid=113359" title="Randy White (American football)">
<text>Randall Lee White (born January 15, 1953), nicknamed &quot;the Manster&quot;, is an American former professional football player who was a defensive tackle for the Dallas Cowboys in the National Football League (NFL) from 1975 to 1988. He played college football for the Maryland Terrapins from 1972 to 1974. He is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame (1994), the Pro Football Hall of Fame (1994) and the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame (1994).

==Early life==
Playing both defensive end and linebacker at Thomas McKean High School in Wilmington, Delaware, Randy is considered to this day the &quot;Best All-Time Player&quot; in the history of Delaware high school football. Graduating in 1971, he was a star player in the state&#x27;s 15th annual Blue-Gold All-Star high school football game played each year since 1956 at the University of Delaware stadium to benefit DFRC and its programs to provide services to Delawareans with intellectual disabilities.

==College career==
White was recruited by the University of Maryland and played as a fullback for the Terrapins during his freshman year. Maryland finished the year with only 2 wins and White did little worth noting during that year. During his sophomore season, new head coach Jerry Claiborne moved Randy to defensive end, noting that he had the skill to be &quot;one of the best five linemen in the U.S.&quot; The move was a natural fit, as by his senior year, he was, as Claiborne put it, &quot;as fast as some of the offensive backs I had coached.&quot; In that senior year (1974), he won numerous awards and honors, including the Outland Trophy, the Lombardi Award, and the Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year. Though Maryland lost in the Liberty Bowl that season to Tennessee, Randy was named the game&#x27;s Most Valuable Player. In 1994, he was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame and in 2000 was named to ABC sports All-time All-America Team. In 1999, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; included him on its All-Century Team for college football.

==Professional career==
White was the Dallas Cowboys&#x27; first pick and the second player selected in the 1975 NFL draft, and was moved to middle linebacker, where he was a backup to Cowboy legend Lee Roy Jordan, playing mostly on special teams his first two seasons, including his rookie season when Dallas lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl X. Jordan retired following the 1976 season, and his slot was filled by Bob Breunig, who held the position the next nine seasons. During his third season (1977), White was moved to right defensive tackle, the same position formerly occupied by &quot;Mr. Cowboy&quot;, Bob Lilly, from 1961 through 1974, a move which in turn moved veteran Larry Cole back to his natural defensive end position (backing up Ed &quot;Too Tall&quot; Jones and Harvey Martin, though he did play left defensive tackle after the retirement of Jethro Pugh.

That year would prove to be his breakout year; he was named to his first All-Pro team, his first Pro Bowl, and (on his 25th birthday) was named co-MVP of Super Bowl XII with teammate Harvey Martin, making him one of ten defensive players to win that honor. In 1978, White was named the NFC Defensive Player of the Year, and would be named to nine consecutive All-Pro and Pro Bowl teams. He would retire in 1988 (coincidentally, also the last season on the sidelines for original Cowboys coach Tom Landry), having played 209 games in 14 seasons, only missing one game during that span. At the time of his retirement, he had played the second most of any Dallas Cowboy in history. During those 14 years, he played in three Super Bowls, six NFC Championship Games, and accumulated 1,104 tackles (701 solo) and 111 sacks. His highest single season sack total was 16 in 1978. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1994. On the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the naming of the only co-MVPs in Super Bowl history, Super Bowl XLVII, which like Super Bowl XII was played in New Orleans, Louisiana, was dedicated to White. Harvey Martin had died in 2001.

Gradually, the accumulation of injuries began to limit White&#x27;s effectiveness. He was credited with only 64 tackles in the 1987 season (a season in which White made the controversial choice to cross the picket line during the players&#x27; strike); this followed shoulder surgery the previous year and a bulging disc in his neck that worsened. In 1988, he played in a backup role, not assuming a three-point stance because of the disability. White openly and honestly acknowledged his frustration that he could no longer play at the level at which he was accustomed, and he decided to retire after the 1988 season.

==Personal life==
White married Dallas model Vicci Haney, in 1978. They have one child together, daughter Jordan.

White is nicknamed &quot;The Manster&quot; (half man, half monster). He studied Thai Boxing under Chai Sirisute, the founder of the Thai Boxing Association of the USA. White&#x27;s round kick reportedly registered 400 psi on a gauge after two months of training.

<text>The 1980 Winter Olympics, officially the XIII Olympic Winter Games and also known as Lake Placid 1980, were an international multi-sport event held from February 13 to 24, 1980, in Lake Placid, New York, United States.

Lake Placid was elected as the host city for the 1980 Winter Games at the 75th International Olympic Committee (IOC) Session in Vienna, Austria in 1974. This marked the second time the Upstate New York village hosted the Winter Games, after 1932. The only other candidate city to bid for the 1980 games, Vancouver-Garibaldi withdrew before the final vote. This was the second of two consecutive Olympic games held in North America, following by the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

Some venues from the 1932 Games were renovated for use in the 1980 Games, and events were held at the Olympic Center, Whiteface Mountain, Mt. Van Hoevenberg Olympic Bobsled Run, the Olympic Ski Jumps, the Cascade Cross Country Ski Center, and the Lake Placid High School Speed Skating Oval. The Games were a success in terms of sport, but the organization was criticized because of numerous transport problems. The 1980 Games were the last to take place in a city of less than 15,000 inhabitants.

The Lake Placid Winter Olympics brought together 1,072 athletes from 37 countries to take part in six sports and 10 disciplines comprising a total of 38 official events (one more than in 1976). People&#x27;s Republic of China, Cyprus and Costa Rica participated in the Winter Olympic Games for the first time. American speed skater Eric Heiden set the record for most medals for an athlete in one edition of the Winter Olympic Games after he medaled in all five speed skating events. The Olympic ice hockey tournament saw the young American team defeat the heavily favored Soviet professionals in what became known as the &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot;, on their way to the gold medal. In the other disciplines, Soviet Nikolaj Zimjatov won three gold medals in cross-country skiing and the Liechtenstein skier Hanni Wenzel won her country&#x27;s first two gold medals in alpine skiing. The Soviet Union finished first in the medal standings, with ten gold medals, while East Germany won the most medals overall, 23. The United States was third on both counts.

== Context ==
=== Selection of the host city ===
After Lake Placid hosted the 1932 Olympic Winter Games, the community continued to bid on upcoming editions of the Games, submitting seven total bid attempts, including 1948, 1952, 1956. Three of these were supported by the United States Olympic Committee and presented to the International Olympic Committee: 1968, 1976 and 1980. Until 1980, each of the bid attempts failed, either due to falling short of gaining support at the national level, or during the IOC vote. When Denver withdrew after being selected to host the 1976 Winter Games, the USOC initially supported Salt Lake City to replace Denver. But on January 26, 1973, the Salt Lake City bid collapsed due to unsecured financial backing and discontent by Utah residents. Lake Placid city and USOC submitted a late bid to host the 1976 Games to the IOC in February 1973,as there was a risk that this selection process would be canceled due to the lack of interested parties. The IOC selected Innsbruck, Austria to host the 1976 Games in place of Denver, with Lake Placid finishing as the runner-up. IOC President Lord Killanin later stated that members of the IOC executive favored the Austrian bid as a way to &quot;make peace with the people of Austria&quot; over the decision in 1972 to declare Austrian skiing star Karl Schranz ineligible for the games as a professional athlete.

Undeterred, Lake Placid resent the same campaign materials that were originally used for the 1976 bid to United States Olympic Committee on November 20, 1973, and made the official bid in September 1974. The United States Olympic Committee, embarrassed by Denver&#x27;s 1976 withdrawal, required Lake Placid&#x27;s bid to be widely supported by residents and government. Lake Placid satisfied the USOC requirements, with a referendum held in October 1973 garnering 75 per cent support for hosting the games, a joint resolution of the New York Legislature, a joint resolution from the Congress of the United States, a letter of support from the Governor of New York and the President of the United States. Lake Placid also secured the support of the environmental groups Sierra Club and Adirondack Mountain Club.

Three other cities declared themselves candidates for the 1980 Winter Games: Vancouver—Garibaldi (Canada), Lahti (Finland) and Chamonix (France). The bids for Lahti and Chamonix were withdrawn early in the bid process, and Vancouver (the latter hosted the 2010 games), which was unable to obtain the support of the Government of British Columbia, withdrew its candidacy on October 4, 1974. The members of the IOC awarded the 1980 Winter Games to Lake Placid on October 23, 1974, during the 75th IOC Session in Vienna.
=== International political context ===
The Lake Placid Games took place in the shadow of the Cold War with a number of other complex international events occurring in the lead up to the games. In November 1979, Sixty-two Americans were taken hostage at the United States Embassy in Tehran by Iranian militants, a situation that would not resolve until after the Games. In December 1979, the Soviet Union began the invasion of Afghanistan, which led to United States President Jimmy Carter calling for the international boycott of the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow. The Western governments first considered the idea of boycotting the Moscow 1980 Summer Olympics in response to the situation in Afghanistan at the 20 December 1979 meeting of NATO representatives. The idea was not completely new to the world: in the mid-1970s, proposals for an Olympic boycott circulated widely among human rights activists and groups as a sanction for Soviet violations of human rights. At that time, very few member governments expressed interest in the proposal. However, this idea gained popularity in early January 1980 when Soviet nuclear scientist and dissident Andrei Sakharov called for a boycott. On 14 January 1980, the Carter Administration joined Sakharov&#x27;s appeal and set a deadline by which the Soviet Union must pull out of Afghanistan or face the consequences, including an international boycott of the games. On 26 January 1980, Canadian Prime Minister Joe Clark announced that Canada, like the US, would boycott the Olympic Games if Soviet forces did not leave Afghanistan by 20 February 1980. Carter also proposed moving the Olympics to Greece on a permanent basis to eliminate the issue of politicisation of the Games&#x27; hosting, but the International Olympic Committee (IOC) rejected this idea. Ultimately, 66 nations would boycott the 1980 Summer Olympics, but this did not impact the Lake Placid Games.

Another ongoing international situation was the conflict between People&#x27;s Republic of China and Taiwan. Taiwan competed under the name of &quot;Republic of China&quot; and with its national flag until the 1976 Winter Games. In October 1979, the International Olympic Committee recognized the Olympic Committee of the People&#x27;s Republic of China after threats from China to withdraw from the Games, and forced Taiwan to take the name &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot; and to adopt a new flag for the 1980 Games. The decision was appealed to Swiss court, and was upheld on January 15, 1980. The Taiwanese delegation refused to comply with the IOC&#x27;s decision and arrived at the Olympic Village with the same flag and the same name as before. After being refused entry, the Taiwan team canceled their participation in the Games. The People&#x27;s Republic of China, which threatened to withdraw if Taiwan participated under the name of &quot;Republic of China&quot;, took part in its first Olympic Games since 1952 and the first Winter Games in its history.

== Organization ==
=== Organizing Committee ===
The Lake Placid Olympic Organizing Committee (LPOOC) was established as a not-for-profit corporation in December 1974. Its board of directors was made up of 48 people, with a 13-member executive board. Ron MacKenzie, who was instrumental in developing the region and securing the Games, was the chair of the organizing committee when it was founded. He died in December 1978, fourteen months before the start of the Games. J. Bernard Fell was the chairman of the board of directors and Art Devlin was the vice-chairman. The LPOOC&#x27;s vision for the Games was a simple Games that would return to the basics of the Olympic movement.

=== Finances ===
The budget for the 1980 Winter Olympic Games grew from an initial projection of US$30 million, to a total of million. The cost of the games was financed by three parties, the Federal government ($82.7 million), the State of New York ($32.4 million), and the organizing committee ($53.6 million). In the 2016 study of cost overruns at Olympic Games at Oxford University, researchers found the Lake Placid Winter Olympic Games had the largest cost overruns of any Winter Games at 324 per cent above the planned cost. The budget overruns were attributed to environmental protection measures, additional work undertaken to modernize existing facilities, overly optimistic cost estimates, and inflation. The Games ended with a deficit of $8.5 million. After a request for funds and the authorities&#x27; refusal, the organizing committee saw no other option but to declare bankruptcy, but in January 1981 the Governor of New York announced that the remaining deficit would be paid by New York State.

The construction was financed by the Federal government and the State of New York at a total cost of $92 million including $22.7 million for the Olympic Village, $16.9 million for the Olympic Center, more than $15 million for the alpine ski center of Whiteface Mountain, $7.9 million for the facilities of Mont Van Hoevenberg (cross-country skiing, bobsleigh and biathlon), $5.4 million for the ski jumps and $5.3 million for the bobsled run. Additional costs included transport improvements totaling $4.8 million, the extension of the electricity and hydroelectric network at $2.7 million, and construction for the headquarters of the New York State Police at $3.8 million. In addition, $8 million was allocated for security costs. The expenses of the organizing committee were mainly administrative totaling $48.1 million, and for press and broadcasting centers.

The increasing costs for the Games and charges of nepotism and mismanagement resulted in a federal auditor investigating the LPOOC. Public questions regarding accounting practices and contract awards resulted in the LPOOC&#x27;s marketing director to be replaced. Further scrutiny came when another director was asked to resign when it became public they had not filed income taxes for a number of years. The company awarded the food management contract for the Games came under federal investigation for associations with organized crime.

Revenue for the LPOOC came primarily from sponsorship contracts signed with more than 200 companies totaling around $30 million in cash, goods or services, and from the sale of broadcasting rights totaling $21 million and included $8 million donated to the IOC.

Around 550,000 tickets were distributed for the 1980 Winter Olympic Games. Ticket distribution to the public included different regions of the United States (65.8%), Canada (6%) and other countries (8.2%). The remainder was distributed among sponsors and suppliers (8.7%), the US Olympic committee, the organizing committee, authorities, donors and authorized companies (10.1%) or kept in reserve (1.2%). The public prices for tickets ranged from $15 to $70.

=== Security ===
Security for the Lake Placid Winter Games was provided by the New York State Police and 26 other agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The organizing committee also hired the private security company Pinkerton National Detective Agency. The security headquarters were located at Ray Brook, which also was the site of the Olympic Village. Police officers were trained in hostage negotiation techniques and various sensors were installed to detect any terrorist attack. A four-meter double barrier was erected surrounding the Olympic Village.

=== Transportation ===
The Lake Placid Winter Games were plagued with transportation problems complicating the planning and operations of the Games. The small mountain community did not have the accommodations or resources to handle the expected 50,000 spectators each day. Most of the accommodations within the community were reserved for Games officials and athletes&#x27; families, meaning spectators commuted as much as 90 miles daily to attend events. Anticipating these challenges, the LPOOC prohibited private cars from entering Lake Placid for the duration of the Games. Instead the LPOOC provided car parks and a shuttle system to transport spectators to the competition venues, and hired 60 taxis and 300 coaches, instead of the 450 initially planned, to be available to athletes, coaches, officials and VIPs.

The first evidence that the Games would be plagued with transportation issues came with the February 1979 pre-Olympic ski jumping competition which saw spectators create an 11-mile traffic jam. Once the Games started, the inadequate transportation planning was evident quickly as American and Soviet athletes arrived late for the opening ceremony. Throughout the Games the main street of Lake Placid was often blocked by traffic jams, and journalists, spectators and athletes found long waits at bus stops. Spectators were often left stranded either missing events or unable to return home from events. After five days, the Governor of New York Hugh Carey declared a partial state of emergency to address the issues.

The LPOOC attributed the transportation challenges, among other things, to the lack of communication with transport companies and the State.

=== Visual identity ===
The Emblem of the 1980 Olympic Winter Games contains several symbols. The right part is reminiscent of the mountains surrounding Lake Placid and the left part is a stylized Ionic Column that refers to Ancient Olympics. The indentation at the top of the column represents two basins which symbolize the two editions of the Games organized in Lake Placid. On the Games poster, the Olympic rings overhang this emblem.

== Highlights ==
Notable highlights included:
* The United States men&#x27;s ice hockey team, composed mostly of collegiate players and not predicted to advance beyond group play, won the gold medal. The United States team&#x27;s 4–3 win over the veteran and professional Soviet team, which came into the 1980 Games having won four consecutive Olympic gold medals, became known as the &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot; in American popular culture. The win captured the hearts of Americans, even though it was the win against Finland that secured the gold medal.
*Eric Heiden of the United States won gold in the 500m, 1000m, 1500m, 5000m, and 10,000m speed skating events, setting four Olympic records and one world record (10,000m) in the process and delivering 83% of the American gold medals (the only other gold, as noted above, was won by the hockey team). Heiden became the first person to win all five speed skating events, the first of only three to win five gold medals in individual events at a single Games (either Summer or Winter), and is still the only athlete to win five gold medals at one Winter Games.
* Sweden&#x27;s Ingemar Stenmark won both the giant slalom and the slalom.
* Hanni Wenzel won the women&#x27;s giant slalom and slalom, making Liechtenstein the smallest country to produce an Olympic champion.
* Ulrich Wehling of East Germany and Irina Rodnina of the USSR won their respective events for the third time, Wehling in Nordic combined and Rodnina in pairs figure skating.
* Aleksandr Tikhonov of the USSR earned his fourth straight gold medal as part of the 4 × 7.5 km biathlon relay team.
* Nikolay Zimyatov of the USSR earned three gold medals in cross-country skiing.
* Robin Cousins won gold for Great Britain in the men&#x27;s singles figure skating.
* East Germany won the most medals overall (23) but had fewer golds (9) than the USSR (10).
* In possibly the most dramatic duel of the games, Sweden&#x27;s Thomas Wassberg edged Finland&#x27;s Juha Mieto in the 15 km cross-country skiing by 0.01 seconds, the closest margin of victory ever in Olympic cross-country skiing.
* Although they did not get any medals, the People&#x27;s Republic of China entered the Olympic Games for the first time after the IOC agreed to designate the Republic of China &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot;.
* Lake Placid 1980 marked the first use of artificial snow in Olympic competition.

== Sports ==
There were 38 events contested in 6 sports (10 disciplines). See the medal winners, ordered by sport:
== Venues ==
*Intervales Ski-Hill – Nordic combined (ski jumping), Ski jumping
*Lake Placid Equestrian Stadium – Opening Ceremony
*Lake Placid Olympic Sports Complex Cross Country Biathlon Center – Biathlon, Cross-country skiing, Nordic combined (Cross-country skiing)
*Mt. Van Hoevenberg Bob and Luge Run – Bobsleigh, Luge (separate tracks)
*Olympic Center – Figure skating, Ice hockey, Closing ceremonies
*James B. Sheffield Speed Skating Oval – Speed skating
*Whiteface Mountain – Alpine skiing

The former Will Rogers Memorial Hospital was briefly used as press headquarters.

The site was considered ideal for the available infrastructure from the 1932 Winter Olympics, most notably the Bobsleigh run. The existing facilities meant the Olympics could be staged on a reasonable budget and with limited environmental impact. It was not just a matter of convenience, either, according to Lake Placid&#x27;s congressman, Representative Robert McEwen. &quot;It is no secret to us in America that the measure of federal support given to athletes in Communist countries (so that they win medals and improve the countries&#x27; image abroad) is on a level unknown to us here in America,&quot; he told Congress.&quot; This would be a step in the right direction, a worthy investment in American winter athletes.&quot;

The local Olympic committee needed congressional approval for funding to build the Olympic Village. Congress required an after use contract for facilities, and it was agreed that the Olympic Village would be built in accordance to Federal Bureau of Prisons needs. Following the Olympic Games, it was repurposed for Federal Correctional Institution, Ray Brook.

== Medal count ==

These are the top ten nations that won medals at the 1980 Winter Games.
== Participating nations ==
37 NOCs participated.

Cyprus made their Olympic debut at the games. The People&#x27;s Republic of China and Costa Rica both made their Winter Olympic debut. The Republic of China refused to attend both the Summer Games in Montreal, the Winter Games in Lake Placid and the Summer Games in Moscow over the IOC&#x27;s recognition of the People&#x27;s Republic of China as &quot;China&quot;, and its request for the Republic of China to compete as &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot;. The PRC, on the other hand, returned to the Olympics for the first time since 1952 and made its Winter Olympic debut, however then boycotting the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics.

===Number of athletes by National Olympic Committees===
== Mascot ==

Roni is the Olympic mascot of these Games, created by Don Moss. The mascot is a racoon, which is a familiar animal from the mountainous region of the Adirondacks where Lake Placid is situated. The name Roni comes from the word &quot;racoon&quot; in Iroquoian, the language of the native people from the region of the State of New York and Lake Placid and was chosen by Lake Placid school children.

== Theme song ==
The official theme song for the 1980 Winter Olympics was &quot;Give It All You Got&quot; by the American flugelhorn player Chuck Mangione, who performed the song (along with the song &quot;Piña Colada&quot;) live at the Closing Ceremony, with the Hamilton Philharmonic Orchestra (Canada).

<text>The 1984 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XIV Olympic Winter Games (Serbo-Croatian and Slovene: ; Cyrillic: ; ) and commonly known as Sarajevo &#x27;84 (Cyrillic: ; ), were a winter multi-sport event held between 8 and 19 February 1984 in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia. It was the first Winter Olympic Games held in a Slavic language-speaking country, as well as the only Winter Olympics held in a communist country before the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. It was the second consecutive Olympic Games held in a communist country, after the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union.

The Games were held in Sarajevo and at neighbouring resorts in the Dinaric Alps located less than 25 kilometers from the city. At the first days of the Games, the sports program was disrupted by extreme weather conditions and the alpine ski events started four days later than planned.

The Games brought together 1272 athletes from 49 countries, which represents a significant increase compared to 1980. Athletes participated in six sports and ten disciplines for a total of thirty-nine official events, one more than four years earlier. Seven National Olympic Committees sent their athletes to the Olympic Winter Games for the first time, including Egypt, British Virgin Islands, Monaco, Puerto Rico and Senegal. Finland&#x27;s Marja-Liisa Hämäläinen, who won all three individual races in cross-country skiing, earned the most individual medals of the Games. The host country Yugoslavia won its first-ever medal at the Winter Games after alpine skier Jure Franko came second in the giant slalom. East Germany, which won all gold and silver medals in women&#x27;s speed skating and bobsleigh, topped the medal table for the first time with twenty-four medals overall, nine of which were gold.

The 1984 Winter Olympics, considered a success, made it possible to further modernize Sarajevo and develop winter sports in Yugoslavia, but the war in Yugoslavia, which broke out in 1992, heavily damaged the city and the Olympic facilities. Some sites have been renovated after the war but others remain abandoned, the former bobsleigh/luge track being one of the more well-known abandoned sites.

==Host city selection==
=== Selection of the host city ===
A study entitled &quot;The possibilities and problems of tourism development continental in Yugoslavia&quot; and published in 1968 by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) first indicated that Yugoslavia and in particular the region of Sarajevo have favorable conditions for the development of winter sports. As early as 1970, the authorities in Sarajevo planned to host the Winter Olympics to promote this development and become a sustainable winter sports center. They first considered a candidature for the Games of 1976 or 1980 but, after having modernized the city within the framework of the project &quot;Protection of the environment and of man&quot;, applied for those of 1984. The bid committee was created on 23 November 1977.

Two other candidates for the Games were Gothenburg in Sweden and Sapporo in Japan. The Gothenburg project was considered expensive and if it were the winner, the logistics expenses would be gigantic, because the competition places would be decentralized. Sapporo had previously hosted the Games in 1972, only twelve years before the proposed 1984 Games and Japan presented Nagoya to bid to the 1988 Summer Olympics. The city therefore had experience and most of the infrastructure present and was in use since then, but new options were seen as more attractive. Sarajevo presented a compact project, with all the planned venues within 25 kilometers of the city, and has experience of several international competitions such as Alpine Skiing World Cup events, and the European Figure Skating Championishipis.

The host city for the XIV Olympic Winter Games was announced on 18 May 1978, during the 80th session of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in Athens, Greece. Sarajevo was selected by a margin of three votes over Sapporo, Japan. Gothenburg became the first Swedish city to lose a Winter Olympics bid; other Swedish cities, such as Falun and Östersund, would later lose consecutive bids to the Calgary (1988), Albertville (1992), Lillehammer (1994), Nagano (1998), and Salt Lake City (2002), respectively. Sarajevo, the capital of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, was the third-largest city of Yugoslavia at the time.

===Politics===
The 1984 Winter Games took place during the Cold War, four years after the boycott of the Moscow Games by 66 National Olympic Committees including the United States and a few months before the boycott of the Los Angeles 1984 Games by the Soviet Union and another 17 National Olympics Committees. International tensions did not affect the Winter Games.

== Organization ==
=== Organizing ===

A provisional organizing committee was created on July 13, 1978, and the final committee with 79 members was formed as April 1980 by the Yugoslav Olympic Committee and the Sarajevo Municipal Assembly. Branko Mikulic, member of the presidency of the central committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, was appointed chairman of the organizing committee. Ahmed Karabegovic was appointed the secretary-general and Anto Sucic, then president of the Sarajevo Municipal Assembly, became the president of the executive committee. The organizing committee included the president of the Yugoslav Olympic committee and representatives of the Federal Executive Council, the League of Communists and the Socialist Alliance of the Working People.

=== Financial aspects ===
According to the financial results of the Games, the revenues amounted to YUD 19.83 billion (approximately million) and expenses at YUD 17.3 billion ( million), a net amount of YUD 2.54 billion ( million). The official report for the games listed the final profit at million.

This was the first time in history that the Winter Olympic Games were organized in a communist state, but the organizers did not hesitate to partner with capitalist companies to finance the Games. The Organizing Committee argued it was not hypocritical because sport must be above political influence. The organizing committee signed 218 contracts and arrangements in Yugoslavia and 459 on the foreign market. This included the sale of television rights, sponsorship, sale of license rights, free delivery of goods and equipment, advertising, donations as well as Olympic coins, lottery and philately. Marketing brought in YUD 4.31 billion on the national market and YUD 9.42 billion on the foreign market, totaling YUD 13.73 billion ( million). The government also contributed to the financing of the Games: the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina paid YUD 1.83 billion, the national government of Yugoslavia and the other republics and autonomous regions, YUD 780 million and the city of Sarajevo, YUD 1 billion. From 1982 to the end of 1984, a deduction made from citizens&#x27; salaries (0.2% for citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, 0.3% for those of Sarajevo) brought in YUD 1.21 billion.

Building the facilities and purchasing the equipment for the Games cost a total of YUD 8.63 billion. The expenses were listed at 2.26 billion for equipment, 970 million for the Zetra hall, 600 million for the alpine ski slopes, 500 million for the ice rink and the Main Press Center, 560 million for the bobsleigh and luge track, 400 million for the speed skating track and 340 million for the ski jumps. The organizing committee also invested YUD 1.65 billion in posts, telegraphs and telephones, the television network, the expansion and modernization of the Sarajevo Airport, the road network, 23 sports centers and other facilities. Preparation and organization costs were listed at YUD 4.51 billion.

=== Transport ===
The region&#x27;s transport network was developed for the Games. Roads with a total length of 160 kilometers were constructed to improve access to mountain sites from Sarajevo or to link the sites to each other. The city&#x27;s train station and the Sarajevo International Airport were renovated, and an international terminal was built.

Most of the athletes, accompanying persons, officials and visitors arrived in Yugoslavia by regular international flights to Zagreb and Belgrade and reached Sarajevo by trains, buses or charter flights that landed directly on the city. Spectators were transported to the venues by coaches, rental or personal cars, and minibuses. These options were also used for official transport.

=== Visual identity ===
The emblem of the 1984 Winter Olympics was a stylized snowflake which also used the national embroidery motif overhung with the Olympic rings. The mascot for the competition was chosen by readers of Yugoslav newspapers from among six entries. The mascot was a wolf named Vučko and created by Slovenian Jože Trobec.

== Media ==
More than 3,000 employees of the Yugoslav public broadcaster, Yugoslav Radio Television, produced 204 hours of television broadcasts. The number of countries in which received broadcasts of the games on television increased from 40 to 100 and the broadcasting rights, which were million in 1980, stood at million. Media revenue is shared between the organizing committee which received two-thirds and the IOC which collected one-third. The channel ABC spent million to broadcast the footage in the United States, nearly 51% of all money spent on broadcasting rights.

The Games were covered by 7,393 representatives of the media from 39 countries: 2,363 journalists from the print media and 5,030 employees of television and radio channels. Seven Media Press Centers and International Broadcaster Centers were set at the various competition venues, the main one was inside the Skenderija Center.

== Torch relay ==
The torch relay for the 1984 Winter Olympics started in Olympia and then proceeded by airplane to Dubrovnik. The total distance of the torch relay through Yugoslavia was plus of local routes. There were two main routes: one in the west (Split – Ljubljana – Zagreb – Sarajevo), in length; and the other in the east (Skopje – Novi Sad – Belgrade – Sarajevo), in length. The final torchbearer, from a total of 1,600, was figure skater Sanda Dubravčić, who received the torch from cross country skier Ivo Čarman. One of the two original torches is held in a private collection in Žalec, Slovenia. There are also 20 more torches in Greece, owned by individual athletes who were the torchbearers from Ancient Olympia to the nearby military airport and from Athens Domestic Airport to the Panathinaikon Stadium where the Ceremony of handing over the Olympic Flame to the Sarajevo Olympic Games Committee occurred.

The Vučko is a long-time symbol of Sarajevo.
== Venues ==


In 1978, the Sarajevo region had an artificial ice rink, a few cross-country ski trails and biathlon and alpine ski slopes. Most of the facilities remained to be built. The construction of the new venues began in the summer of 1979 and was completed in December 1982, which made it possible to organize 31 national and international test events during the pre-Olympic period. All the events took place in Sarajevo or at the neighbour resorts in the Dinaric Alps located less than 25 kilometers from the city&#x27;s downtown.

The Koševo City Stadium, built in 1947 in the center of Sarajevo, was completely renovated to host the opening ceremony of the Games. Its capacity was 45,000. The Zetra Olympic Hall, with a capacity of 8,500, was built near the Koševo stadium for part of the ice hockey and figure skating events as well as the closing ceremony. A natural speed skating track was also set up in the same district. Skenderija Complex, located in another part of town, was renovated and expanded for the Games to include another ice rink with a capacity 8,500 seats which hosted the other hockey and figure skating events, the main press center and the medal plaza which for the first time was inside an indoor hall .

The men&#x27;s alpine ski races were held on Bjelašnica, the highest mountain at 2,067 meters located southwest of Sarajevo. The women&#x27;s events were contested on Jahorina, at an altitude of 1,913 meters and located to the south-east of the city. The Nordic events took place on Igman, in an area near Mount Bjelašnica. Igman Olympic Jumps of 70 and 90 meters were built in Malo Polje. The already existing cross-country ski and biathlon tracks in Veliko Polje were redeveloped and a new shooting range installed for the biathlon. A bobsleigh and luge track, the first in the country&#x27;s history, was built on the Trebević south-east of Sarajevo. The track has a length of 1300 meters and a drop of 126 meters.

=== Accommodation sites ===
The main Olympic village was built in the Mojmilo district of Sarajevo near the Koševo Stadium. Approximately 1,950 persons were accommodated in the 639 apartments available. The organizers built a secondary Olympic village on Mount Igman for athletes and coaches of cross-country skiing, Nordic combined and biathlon, with a capacity of 500 people. A press village built in the Dobrinja district accommodated representatives of the press, radio and television as well as accompanying staff with 2,100 apartments for a total of 8,500 beds. Members of the IOC, international sports federations, national committees and some NOCs with small delegations stayed in at existing Holiday Inn in Sarajevo comprising 340 rooms. Finally, another 19,400 beds were made available to tourists in minor hotels, private accommodation or rental apartments in the Sarajevo region.

=== Biathlon ===
The biathlon events were held in Veliko Polje on Mount Igman.

Biathlon races began with the individual 20 km sprint. The 19-year-old East German Frank-Peter Rötsch quickly took the lead, but it was ultimately the West German Peter Angerer who won with a time one minute faster. Rötsch was second, and the bronze medal went to the Norwegian Eirik Kvalfoss. The next event was the 10 km sprint. Kvalfoss, world champion in 1982 and 1983, won the race despite two missed targets. Angerer won the silver medal due to a good finish and the East German Matthias Jacob was the bronze medalist. The reigning Olympic champion Frank Ullrich missed three targets and finished only 17th. The Soviets did not win an individual medal and were not favorites for the relay. Dmitriy Vasilyev, Juri Kashkarov, Algimantas Šalna and Sergei Bulygin won the race however; this was the fifth consecutive time that the Soviet Union had won gold in the relay since the start of the event in 1968. Norway finished second with 1:20 ahead of East Germany. Kvalfoss and Angerer therefore ended the Games with three medals in three different events.

=== Bobsleigh ===
The bobsleigh races took place on the bobsleigh/luge track built on the Trebević mountain. The East Germans dominated the discipline as they won the two gold medals and two silver medals. As of 2020, this performance has still not been matched.

East Germans Wolfgang Hoppe and Dietmar Schauerhammer won the two-man bobsleigh event setting the fastest time in three of the four runs. They finished half a second ahead of their compatriots Bernhard Lehmann and Bogdan Musiol. The bobsledders of the Soviet Union created a surprise by placing third and fourth while the Swiss, world champions in 1982 and 1983, had to be content with fifth and sixth places. Swede Carl-Erik Eriksson was the first athlete to compete in six editions of the Olympic Winter Games. At 53 years old, he was also the oldest athlete at the 1984 Games.

In the four-man bobsleigh event, Hoppe again finished first ahead of Lehmann while Silvio Giobellina&#x27;s Swiss bobsleigh won the bronze medal. These three crews finished all the heats in the first three places and in the same order. The differences were large since the Swiss bob 2 crew, which came in fourth, was 2:68 behind.

=== Nordic Combined ===

The Nordic combined athletes competed in three jumps on the 70 meter hill, the two best being counted, then raced 15 kilometers on the tracks of Mount Igman the next day. The classification was established according to a points system. The Norwegian Tom Sandberg was in first place after the jumps. Among the other favorites, the Finns Rauno Miettinen and Jouko Karjalainen occupied the sixth and 15th ranks. Karjalainen won the cross-country ski race with 1:20.7 ahead of second-placed Sandberg, but it was not enough to overtake him in the final standings. Sandberg was the Olympic gold medal champion and Karjalainen silver medalist. Surprisingly, fifth in the two events, the Finn Jukka Ylipulli won the bronze medal and Miettenen, ninth in cross-country skiing, finished fourth.

=== Ice hockey ===

The ice hockey tournament took place on two rinks built in the districts of Zetra and Skenderija. The twelve teams were divided into two groups of six, and the two best teams of each group qualified for the final pool, any points acquired against the teams in the same pool being carried forward.

There was controversy over player eligibility in advance of the Games. The IOC regulations stated that players who had signed a professional contract could not participate, while the International Ice Hockey Federation ruled that only players who had played a professional match were deemed ineligible. Finally, all players who had signed a contract or played a game in the National Hockey League were ineligible to take part in the Games. Conversely, Soviets and Czechoslovaks who had participated in no other activity than ice hockey could participate without any restriction.

The Soviets won all their matches, notably thanks to the KLM Line made up of Vladimir Krutov, Igor Larionov, and Sergei Makarov. Continuing the tradition from the 1964 to 1976 Games, the Soviet Union won the gold medal with a 2–0 win over the Czechoslovaks who took silver. Sweden defeated Canada 2–0 to win the bronze.

=== Luge ===
The luge competitions were held on the Sarajevo Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track built on the Trebević mountain. The East German Torsten Görlitzer and the Italian Ernst Haspinger dominated the first two rounds of the men&#x27;s event, but they both lost time in the third round. The Italian Paul Hildgartner, silver medalist in 1980, set the best time of the last two races and became Olympic champion. The podium was completed by the Soviets Sergey Danilin and Valery Dudin. This was the first time that East Germany had not won a medal in the men&#x27;s luge competition at the Olympic Games since 1964.

East Germany dominated the women&#x27;s event, taking the first three places in every round. World champion in 1983, Steffi Martin won all four races and won the gold medal, Bettina Schmidt won the silver medal, and Ute Oberhoffner won bronze.

The doubles event was very close as the Soviets Yevgeny Belousov and Aleksandr Belyakov were first by 6.7 hundredths of a second after the opening round, but a small mistake at the end of the second and final round cost them the victory. The West Germans Hans Stangassinger and Franz Wembacher won the Olympic title, 4 hundredths of a second ahead of Belousov and Beliakov, and the East Germans Jörg Hoffmann and Jochen Pietzsch won bronze.

=== Figure skating ===
The figure skating events took place at the Skenderija sports center. The American Scott Hamilton, world champion from 1981 to 1983, was first after the compulsory figures of the men&#x27;s competition. The Canadian Brian Orser won the short program and the free skate ahead of Hamilton. Orser, who finished seventh in the compulsory figures, won the silver medal, while Hamilton won gold. The bronze medal went to Czechoslovakian Jozef Sabovčík.

The favorites in the women&#x27;s competition were the Americans Elaine Zayak and Rosalynn Sumners, world champions in 1982 and 1983, respectively, as well as East Germany&#x27;s Katarina Witt. Zayak was only thirteenth in the compulsory figures, which Sumners won, and Witt came third. The East German won the short program while Sumners took fifth place. In the free skate, Witt had a good performance that allowed her to win the gold medal while Sumners, who had a less difficult program than expected, settled for the silver medal. The Soviet Kira Ivanova took third place.

The Soviets Elena Valova and Oleg Vassiliev, world champions in 1983, won the short program and the free program and finished in first place in the pairs event. American siblings Kitty and Peter Carruthers were second and another Soviet pair, Larisa Seleznyova and Oleg Makarov, finished third.

British ice dancers Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean did not disappoint the public. They carried out a very original program set to the music of &quot;Boléro&quot; by Maurice Ravel and the nine judges give them the maximum score of six for artistic impression. Torvill and Dean become Olympic champions ahead of two Soviet couples (Natalia Bestemianova/Andrei Bukin and Marina Klimova/Sergei Ponomarenko).

=== Speed skating ===
For the Games, an outdoor track was constructed with natural ice near the Zetra Olympic Hall. The Soviet Sergey Fokichev won the 500 meters ahead of the Japanese skater Yoshihiro Kitazawa. Erroll Fraser, representing the British Virgin Islands, was the first athlete from the Caribbean to compete in a Winter Games. After finishing third in the 500 meters, the Canadian Gaétan Boucher won the 1,000 and the 1,500 meters; the Quebecer ended the Games with three medals. Soviet Sergey Khlebnikov was second in these two races and the bronze medals were awarded to the Norwegian Kai Arne Engelstad and the Soviet Oleg Bozhev respectively. The Swede Tomas Gustafson, who picked up the training techniques of Eric Heiden, won the 5,000 meters ahead of the Soviet Igor Malkov. In the 10,000 meters, Malkov was this time ahead of Gustafson. The East German René Schöfisch finished third in the two events.

East Germany dominated the women&#x27;s events, winning all of the gold and silver medals as well as a bronze medal, taking nine medals out of the twelve available. Karin Enke, who had won several world titles since winning the 500 meters Olympic gold in 1980, was the favorite in all four races. In the first event, the 1,500 meters, she easily won the gold medal by breaking the world record. She finished ahead of Andrea Ehrig and the Soviet Natalya Petrusyova, who were also among the favorites. The world record holder Christa Luding won the 500 meters ahead of Enke and the Soviet Natalya Glebova. The 1,000 meters podium was identical to that of the 1,500 meters contested three days earlier. In the last race, the 3,000 meters, the East Germans won all three medals: Ehrig ahead of Enke and Gabi Zange. This was the third time that a country had won the first three places in an Olympic speed skating event. Enke ended the Games with four medals and Ehring with three.

=== Ski jumping ===
The ski jumping events took place on the Igman hills, southwest of Sarajevo in windy weather conditions. On the normal hill, 20-year-old Matti Nykänen of Finland led the standings after the first round by achieving a jump of 91 meters. The 19-year-old East German Jens Weissflog was second with a jump of 90 meters. In the second run, Weissflog jumped to 87 meters and Nykänen, who would have won gold with a jump of 86 meters, landed at 84 meters. The East German was the Olympic champion ahead of the Finn. Jari Puikkonen, also Finnish, produced the best jump of the event: a jump of 91.5 meters allowed him to move up from 21st to third place. The final scores were close: there was a 1.2 point difference between the first and the second as well as between the second and the third.

Nykänen largely dominated the event on the big hill. He jumped to 116 meters in the first run, while Weissflog only reached 107 meters. The Finn increased his lead by also producing the best jump of the second set. He won the Olympic title with a 17.5 points lead, the biggest gap between first and second in Olympic ski jumping history. Weissflog finished second and Czechoslovakian Pavel Ploc took third place.

=== Alpine skiing ===
The alpine skiing races took place on two different mountains: the men&#x27;s events were contested on Bjelašnica and the women&#x27;s events on Jahorina. The events started on February 13, four days behind schedule, because of strong winds and heavy snowfall.

The American Bill Johnson, winner at Wengen in January, won the downhill ahead of the Swiss Peter Müller and the Austrian Anton Steiner. Johnson became the first American male to win a downhill medal in alpine skiing at the Olympic Games. The Swede Ingemar Stenmark, considered one of the best skiers in the world in technical events, surrendered his Olympic eligibility in order to negotiate an agreement with the Swedish Ski Association to personally retain more of his sponsorship money. Also missing was Marc Girardelli, who previously refused to train with the Austrian team and competed under the Luxembourg flag. Girardelli did not have Luxembourg citizenship and was not permitted to compete in the Games. The Swiss Max Julen set the fastest time of the first heat and the second of the second heat and became Olympic champion.

The Slovenian Jure Franko, winner of the second round and second in the final standings, won the first Yugoslav medal in the history of the Winter Games. The bronze medal went to Andreas Wenzel of Liechtenstein. The American Phil Mahre, favorite in Stenmark&#x27;s absence, finished first in the slalom ahead of his twin brother Steve. This was the eighth time that siblings had taken the top two places in an individual Olympic event, but the Mahres were the first twins to achieve this performance. The French Didier Bouvet won the bronze medal. Both Mahre brothers retired from professional skiing after the Games at the age of 26.

The Swiss Michela Figini won her first World Cup race two weeks before the Games. First of three of the five training heats in Sarajevo, she won the downhill ahead of her compatriot Maria Walliser and the Czechoslovak Olga Charvátová. At 17 years old, Figini became the youngest Olympic champion in alpine skiing. The giant slalom podium was unexpected: the American Debbie Armstrong, who had never won a World Cup race, won gold ahead of her compatriot Christin Cooper. The Frenchwoman Perrine Pelen was third while another American, Tamara McKinney, finished in fourth place. Only 21 of the 45 starters completed the two heats of the slalom. The Frenchwoman Christelle Guignard won the first round but did not complete the second. The Italian Paoletta Magoni, fourth in the first round and winner of the second round, became Olympic champion despite having also never won the World Cup. Pelen won a second medal, silver, ahead of Liechtenstein&#x27;s Ursula Konzett.

=== Cross-country skiing ===

The cross-country skiing races took place in Veliko Polje, on the Igman mountain. A new technique, skate skiing, was widely used at the 1984 Games. However, it was prohibited on the last 200 meters of each race to avoid falls. The women&#x27;s 20 kilometers, contested at the 1978 and 1982 World Championships, appeared at the Olympic Games.

In the 15 kilometers, the Finn Harri Kirvesniemi led the race after 5.8 kilometers, but it was the Swede Gunde Svan who won. Aki Karvonen and Kirvesniemi, both Finnish, completed the podium. The 30 kilometers took place under difficult conditions. Three-time Olympic champion in 1980, the Soviet Nikolaj Zimjatov, won another gold medal ahead of his compatriot Alexander Savjalov and Svan. Zimjatov was the third cross-country skier ever to win four Olympic titles after the Swede Sixten Jernberg and the Soviet Galina Kulakova. After a tight 50 kilometers, the Swede Thomas Wassberg took the gold, just 4.9 seconds ahead of Svan, while Karvonen finished third. In the 4 × 10 kilometer relay, Svan, the last rider of the Swedish team, took ten seconds ahead of the Soviet, Zimjatov, and finished in first place. Finland, eighth after the first skier, took the bronze medal. Svan ended his Games with four medals (two gold, one silver, and one bronze).

After unsuccessfully competing in the 1976 and 1980 Olympics, Finland&#x27;s Marja-Liisa Hämäläinen led the overall World Cup standings in 1983. In Sarajevo, she first won the 10 kilometers almost 19 seconds ahead of the Soviet Raisa Smetanina, the Olympic champion in 1976. The Norwegian Brit Pettersen won the bronze medal. Hämäläinen then won the 5 kilometers, 10 seconds ahead of the Norwegian Berit Aunli and 14 seconds ahead of the Czechoslovak Květoslava Jeriová-Pecková. She also won the 20 kilometers ahead of Smetanina and the Norwegian Anne Jahren. Norway, already in the lead after the first skier, won the 4 × 5 kilometers. Czechoslovakia won their first Olympic relay medal, silver, two seconds ahead of Finland who won the bronze medal. Hämäläinen, who won all three individual events as well as bronze in the relay, was the only three-time gold medalist of these Games.

The organizers had to face bad weather conditions at the start of the Games. During the night of 8 to 9 February, 40 centimeters of snow fell in Sarajevo and up to one meter on mountain sites. On February 9, the men&#x27;s downhill skiing was postponed due to winds blowing up to 200 km/h and the other events were held several hours late.

Northern European countries occupied the following ranks: Finland was fourth (with three gold medals by cross-country skier Marja-Liisa Hämäläinen), Sweden fifth, and Norway sixth. The host country finished with one silver medal, the first time that Yugoslavia won a medal at the Olympic Winter Games. Austria, which finished fourth in 1980, ended the Games with only one medal, a bronze, Austria&#x27;s worst result in the history of the Winter Olympics.

===Podium sweeps===

== Reactions and fallout ==
=== Reactions ===
The Sarajevo Games were considered a big success for their time. After the games, the trails were well maintained despite the bad weather conditions, the security services were discreet and the transport system worked well. The international media considered this edition more festive and warm than the Games held 4 years before. The competition has not yet left debts or losses for the Organizing Committee, for the city or even for the country.

=== Fallout ===

The Olympic Games had a positive impact on Sarajevo. The expansion of the airport, the renovation of the main train and bus stations and the expansion of the number of hotels, restaurants and parks increased the quality of life in the city. The Olympic Village became a residential area and new sports venues accelerated the development of winter sports in Yugoslavia. After the Games, the Sarajevo bobsleigh track hosted several events of the Bobsleigh World Cup.

The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the siege of Sarajevo, not foreseen at the time of the Games, lasted from 1992 to 1995. The conflict left tens of thousands of victims and severely damaged Sarajevo and Olympic venues. The Koševo stadium was renovated in 1998, the Zetra hall was rebuilt in 1999 with the support of the IOC and the alpine ski resorts are again in operation. However, the bobsleigh runs and the ski jumping hills are abandoned due to the risk of accidents with landmines and remains of weapons.

In 2001, the city of Sarajevo considered a bid for the organization of the 2010 Winter Olympics to revive the economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina and accelerate the reunification of the country, divided between different ethnic groups. However, the bid was eliminated by the IOC Executive Board. The 2017 European Youth Winter Olympic Festival which was to take place in Sarajevo (with all the events were to be held on the sites used in 1984) But due to the constant delays in the recovery works, the city decided to reverse the order of the hosts with Erzurum in Turkey and Sarajevo hosted the 2019 European Youth Olympic Winter Festival.

<doc id="113365" wikidata="Q11303017" url="?curid=113365" title="Self-evidence">
<text>In epistemology (theory of knowledge), a self-evident proposition is a proposition that is known to be true by understanding its meaning without proof, and/or by ordinary human reason.

Some epistemologists deny that any proposition can be self-evident. For most others, one&#x27;s belief that oneself is conscious and possesses free will are offered as examples of self-evidence. However, one&#x27;s belief that someone else is conscious or has free will are not epistemically self-evident.

The following proposition is often said to be self-evident: &quot;A finite whole is greater than, or equal to, any of its parts&quot;.

A logical argument for a self-evident conclusion would demonstrate only an ignorance of the purpose of persuasively arguing for the conclusion based on one or more premises that differ from it (see &quot;&quot; and begging the question).

==Analytic propositions==
It is sometimes said that a self-evident proposition is one whose denial is self-contradictory. It is also sometimes said that an analytic proposition is one whose denial is self-contradictory. But the concepts mean different things, i.e., an analytic proposition is not always a self-evident proposition. 

Provided that one understands and believes a self-evident proposition, self-evident propositions are not in need of proof. Likewise, that their denial is self-contradictory does not need to be proven. It is in this sense that the self-contradictions at work in self-evident and analytic propositions are different.

Not all analytic propositions are self-evident, and it is sometimes claimed that not all self-evident propositions are analytic: e.g. my knowledge that I am conscious.

==Other uses==
===Informal speech===
In informal speech, &quot;self-evident&quot; often merely means &quot;obvious&quot;, but the epistemological definition is stricter.

===Moral propositions===
Moral propositions may also be regarded as self-evident, although the is–ought problem described by David Hume considers that there is no coherent way to transition from a positive statement to a normative one.

For example, Alexander Hamilton cited the following moral propositions as self-evident in the Federalist No. 23:
* &quot;The means ought to be proportioned to the end.&quot;
* &quot;Every power ought to be commensurate with its object.&quot;
* &quot;There ought to be no limitation of a power destined to effect a purpose which is itself incapable of limitation.&quot;

A famous claim of the self-evidence of a moral truth is in the United States Declaration of Independence, which states, &quot;We hold these Truths to be &quot;self-evident&quot;, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&quot;; philosophically, these propositions&#x27; self-evidence is debatable.

=== Mathematics ===
In mathematics, &quot;self-evident&quot; refers to statements that need no proof. Sometimes axioms are described as self-evident. Other statements are self-evident because the statement is a proof for itself..

<text>Fishguard (, meaning &quot;Mouth of the River Gwaun&quot;) is a coastal town in Pembrokeshire, Wales, with a population of 3,400 (rounded to the nearest 100) as of the 2021 census. Modern Fishguard consists of two parts, Lower Fishguard and the &quot;Main Town&quot;. Fishguard and Goodwick are twin towns with a joint Town Council.

Lower Fishguard is believed to be the site of the original hamlet from which modern Fishguard has grown. It is in a deep valley where the River Gwaun meets the sea, hence the Welsh name for Fishguard. It is a typical fishing village with a short tidal quay. The settlement stretches along the north slope of the valley.

The main town contains the parish church, the High Street and most of the modern development, and lies upon the hill to the south of Lower Fishguard, to which it is joined by a steep and winding road. The west part of the town that faces Goodwick grew in the first decade of the 20th century with the development of Fishguard Harbour.

== Etymology ==
The English name Fishguard derives from Old Norse meaning &quot;fish catching enclosure&quot;, cognate with Modern English &quot;&quot; + &quot;.&quot; In Welsh, means &quot;the mouth of the River Gwaun&quot;, the name of the river referring to the high, wet, level ground of a marsh or moor.

==History==
Fishguard is within the historic Welsh cantref of , and part of the Welsh province of , within the historic Principality of . The coasts of Wales were subject to Norse raids during the Viking Age, and in the latter part of the 10th century Norse trading posts and settlements emerged within Dyfed, with Fishguard established sometime between 950 and 1000 AD.

In 1078 Goodwick Moor, was the scene of a bloody battle in which Rhys, son of Owain ap Edwyn, was defeated and slain by Trahaearn ap Caradog (Brut y Tywysogion) in the Battle of Pwllgwdg,

The English place name indicates that there may have been a Scandinavian trading post, although no evidence has been found. However, the V-shaped stone structures of ancient fish traps can still be seen at low tide on both sides of the bay, and it is believed these were the foundations for wooden fences that would trap the fish as the tide went out. Other examples can be found around the country, and they probably date from Saxon times, though similar devices have been in use since Neolithic times.

Called &quot;Fiscard&quot; until the turn of the 19th century when the name was Anglicised, Fishguard was a marcher borough and in 1603 was described as one of five Pembrokeshire boroughs overseen by a portreeve. The Norman settlement lay along what is now High Street between the church at its north end and the remains of a Norman motte at its south end.

In 1912, Denys Corbett Wilson made the first flight between Britain and Ireland. Starting his journey from Hendon aerodrome on 17 April 1912, he eventually landed in Goodwick on 21 April having made a few unscheduled stops along the way. He then set off from a field near Harbour Village at 5:47 on 22 April and crash-landed 100 minutes later in Crane near Enniscorthy in County Wexford.

Lower Fishguard developed as a herring fishery and port, trading with Ireland, Bristol and Liverpool. In the late 18th century it had 50 coasting vessels, and exported oats and salt herring. In 1779, the port was raided by the privateer &quot;Black Prince&quot;, which bombarded the town when the payment of a £1,000 ransom was refused. As a result, Fishguard Fort was completed in 1781, overlooking Lower Fishguard. The port declined in the latter half of the 19th century.

Fishguard&#x27;s ancient Royal Oak public house was the site of the signing of surrender after the Battle of Fishguard. This brief campaign, on 22–24 February 1797, is the most recent landing on British soil by a hostile foreign force, and thus is often referred to as the &quot;last invasion of mainland Britain&quot;. A force of 1,400 French soldiers landed near Fishguard but surrendered two days later.

A 19th-century vicar of Fishguard, the Rev. Samuel Fenton MA, wrote the book &quot;The History of Pembrokeshire&quot;.

The ancient Parliamentary Borough of Fishguard was contributory to the Borough of Haverfordwest. During the Second World War, the Fishguard Bay Hotel was Station IXc of Special Operations Executive where submersibles were tested in Fishguard Bay.

Fishguard &amp; Goodwick Golf Club was founded in 1921 and closed in the 1960s.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Fishguard, at community (town) and county level: Fishguard and Goodwick Town Council and Pembrokeshire County Council. The town council is based at Fishguard Town Hall in Market Square.

Fishguard was an ancient parish. When parish and district councils were established in 1894, the parish of Fishguard was included in the Haverfordwest Rural District. In 1906 it was decided to create an urban district covering Fishguard, making it independent from the Haverfordwest Rural District Council. The whole parish of Fishguard was considered too large to be an urban district and so it was split into two parishes: Fishguard North covering the main built up area, to be governed by Fishguard Urban District Council, and Fishguard South which stayed in the Haverfordwest Rural District. These changes took effect on 1 April 1907. The first meeting of Fishguard Urban District Council was held on 8 April 1907 at the Town Hall, when John Robertson Richards, a Conservative, was appointed the first chairman of the council.

The urban district was enlarged in 1934 to include neighbouring Goodwick, becoming Fishguard and Goodwick Urban District. Fishguard and Goodwick Urban District was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, with the area becoming part of the district of Preseli Pembrokeshire on 1 April 1974. A community covering the former urban district was established at the same time, with its council taking the name Fishguard and Goodwick Town Council. Preseli Pembrokeshire was abolished in 1996 to become part of a re-established Pembrokeshire.

==Geography==

The town is situated at the back of a north facing bay known as Fishguard Bay () which offers protection from waves generated by prevailing westerly winds. It has a relatively mild climate due to its coastal position. The winds coming from the west or south-west have a determining influence on temperature and precipitation. There is an islet in Fishguard Bay, Needle Rock which reaches .

Wildlife around Fishguard is rich with a wide variety of colourful wild flowers and sea mammals including the grey seal, porpoises and dolphins. The local birdlife include Eurasian curlew, common redshank and sanderling regularly foraging in the lower Fishguard Harbour and European stonechat, great cormorant and northern fulmar can be seen from the coastal path.

==Demography==
According to the 2021 census, Fishguard had a population of roughly 3,400, 29.6% of the population being able to speak Welsh. This compares with 39.8% in 2001, 58.9% in 1951 and 90.3% in 1901.

The population breaks down as follows:

The largest ethnic group in Fishguard is White, making up 97.7% of the population, the county average. The second largest ethnic group is Asian/Asian British who make up 0.9% of the population, also the county average. The largest religious group is Christian with 47.3% of the population, lower than the county average of 48.8%. The second largest religious group is No religion with 43.2% of the population, roughly the county average.

== Landmarks ==
Outside Fishguard there is a stone monument commemorating the signing of the Peace Treaty after the last invasion of Britain in 1797. Women dressed in Welsh costume are said to have startled the invaders. The 19th-century parish church of St Mary&#x27;s contains a memorial stone to the heroine Jemima Nicholas, who helped repel the French invasion. There is also a Bi-Centenary memorial stone monument in West Street, Fishguard to commemorate the invasion. A tapestry was created in 1997 to commemorate the invasion and is on display to the public in Fishguard Town Hall.

There are more than 80 listed buildings in and around the town.

==Community and culture==
Fishguard has hotels and is the main shopping town of North Pembrokeshire with a market in the town hall on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.

Fishguard has a Round Table doing community work including running the Fishguard &amp; Goodwick Carnival and the Fishguard Autumn Festival.

The Gwaun Lodge of the Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes, is a charitable organisation within the community who host sponsored events and other community works throughout the year.

Fishguard has a 180-seat cinema/theatre called Theatr Gwaun which provides a venue for film, music and live theatre and hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1936 and 1986.

==Transport==

Fishguard is the terminus of the London to Fishguard Trunk Road (A40). A regular ferry operated by Stena Line leaves for Rosslare in Ireland from the port of Fishguard Harbour, Goodwick. Following the Brexit withdrawal agreement, freight traffic from Rosslare fell by 50% in January 2021.

Rail services are operated by Transport for Wales Rail from Fishguard Harbour and Fishguard and Goodwick railway stations on the West Wales line to Swansea and Cardiff. Through trains to London were withdrawn in 2004.

Starting in 1909 the fast Cunard liners from New York began anchoring at Fishguard to allow passengers to take a Great Western train to London, saving a few hours compared to Liverpool.

==In the media==
Lower Fishguard was used as &quot;Llareggub&quot; in the film of Dylan Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;, starring Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor and Peter O&#x27;Toole. Many local people were involved in the production of this film as background characters. The film &quot;Moby Dick&quot; (starring Gregory Peck) was filmed there in 1955.

<text>St Davids or St David&#x27;s (, ,  &quot;David&#x27;s house”) is a cathedral city in Pembrokeshire, Wales. It lies on the River Alun and is part of the community of St Davids and the Cathedral Close. It is the resting place of Saint David, Wales&#x27;s patron saint, and named after him.

St Davids is the United Kingdom&#x27;s smallest city by population (number of residents within the wider community was 1,751 in 2021) and urban area, however it is not the smallest city by local authority boundary area (which is the City of London). St Davids was given city status in the 12th century. This does not derive automatically, but in England and Wales was traditionally given to cathedral towns under practices laid down in the early 1540s, when Henry VIII founded dioceses. City status was lost in 1886, but restored in 1994 at the request of Queen Elizabeth II.

==History==
===Early history===

Although the surrounding landscape is home to a number of Palaeolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age sites, archaeological evidence suggests that Pembrokeshire was not heavily occupied by the Romans. As such, only one or two names in Ptolemy&#x27;s Geographia have been linked to the whole county.

Following the Roman withdrawal from Britain, the area that would become St Davids was known in Ecclesiastical Latin as &quot;Meneva&quot; or &quot;Menevia&quot; and in Welsh as &quot;Mynyw&quot;. Some medieval texts state that the area was home to a cell, church or monastery founded by Saint Patrick around the year 470 AD, years before the birth of Saint David.

===Age of David===

David is said to have been born to Saint Non around 500 AD, at the place where the Chapel of St Non now stands. He was baptised by Saint Elvis at Porthclais, and was brought up by his mother at Llanon. He may also have been educated at the &quot;Ty Gwyn&quot;, Whitesands by Saint Paulinus. David is thought to have founded an earlier community somewhere to the west of modern St Davids, before establishing a new church and monastery at a place then known as &quot;Glyn Rhosyn&quot; on the banks of the Afon Alun (where the current Cathedral now stands).

During his life, David gained great fame throughout the Celtic church and was a key figure in the fight against the Pelagian Heresy. At the Synod of Brefi in 545 AD, Saint Dubricius (who held two Bishoprics, Caerleon and Llandaff) is said to have freely given David the ancient Metropolitan See of Caerleon. It is also implied that in transferring the See from Caerleon, David also transferred an important royal court. The Welsh Triads name &quot;Mynyw&quot; as the seat of &quot;one of the three Tribal Thrones of the island of Britain&quot; (the other courts being Celliwig and Pen Rhionydd). The entry states that the court had Arthur as Chief Prince, &quot;Dewi&quot; as the Chief Bishop, and &quot;Maelgwn Gwynedd&quot; as Chief Elder. Indeed, Geoffrey of Monmouth would describe David as &quot;The pious archbishop of Legions, at the city of Menevia&quot; (Caerleon&#x27;s name in both Welsh and Latin means &quot;The city of Legions&quot;).

=== Medieval pilgrim site ===
The ecclesiastical settlement would become known as &quot;Tyddewi&quot; (House of David) and was a famous centre of pilgrimage early in its history, attracting both foreign pilgrims of status and numerous Viking attacks by the ninth century. Its scholastic community was also famous throughout the Celtic world and in Anglo-Saxon England. When Alfred the Great wanted to establish a centre of learning at his court, he requested Asserius Menevensis, (Asser of St Davids) to join them. At that time, Asser had lived all his life at St Davids, being raised, tonsured, trained and ordained there. Yet Alfred&#x27;s desire to secure his service was such that he acquiesced to a number of delays and requests before finally agreeing that Asser could split his time between Alfred&#x27;s court and St David&#x27;s.

The cult of Saint David was actively encouraged by the cathedral&#x27;s pre-Norman Bishops, especially Sulien and Rhigyfarch, who would write &quot;Vita sancti Davidis episcopi&quot;, the standard Vita of the saint.
As the Normans advanced into Pembrokeshire, the city became a marcher borough, and the new hundred was named &quot;Dewisland&quot;. The cathedral was rebuilt during the Norman era and much of the earliest sections that are still extant, date back to the twelfth century. However, it is thought that this cathedral would have followed the layout of medieval structure and it continued to host its many ancient relics, including the remains of David.

At its height, the city was visited by many pilgrims, including noblemen and kings such as William the Conqueror in 1077, Henry II in 1171, and Edward I and Queen Eleanor in 1284. Pope Calixtus II decreed that two pilgrimages to St Davids were equivalent to one to Rome (&quot;Roma semel quantum dat bis Menevia tantum&quot;). This allowed a vast income to be raised from visiting pilgrims in the Middle Ages.

===Decline===
The Reformation saw both the income and importance of St Davids begin to fade as pilgrimages fell out of favour; this was exacerbated by the appointment of a number of English Bishops who were seemingly less concerned with the welfare of the cathedral or the city. Perhaps most infamously, Bishop William Barlow sold the lead from the roof of the Bishop&#x27;s Palace in 1536, beginning a long period of neglect for St Davids.

Barlow had the Bishop&#x27;s chief residence moved to Abergwili, Carmarthenshire in 1542 and St Davids continued to decline. In 1603, the antiquarian George Owen described the city as one of five Pembrokeshire boroughs overseen by a portreeve. The seventeenth century, saw two separate bishops apply for licences to demolish some of the city&#x27;s ancient buildings, and the Bishop&#x27;s palace was now considered &quot;beyond repair&quot;.

By the 19th century, only the Cathedral itself seemed to retain the city&#x27;s former glory, as described in the &quot;Penny Cyclopaedia&quot;:

At present its appearance is that of a poor village, the houses, excepting those of the clergy, being in a ruinous state. The locality is lonely, and the neighbouring district wild and unimproved; but it is still an interesting place as the seat of a large episcopal see, with a fine cathedral and the remains of other magnificent religious edifices.
===Modern city===

The unique nature of the cathedral and the city was evident as late as the twentieth century. Following the disestablishment of the Church in Wales in 1920, the Cathedral Close was allowed to operate as its own civil parish, separate from that of the adjacent city for the next 50 years.

With better transport links and the advent of tourism, the city prospered once more in the later twentieth century, with the city&#x27;s 210 listed buildings making it a destination for walkers, tourists and modern pilgrims. Many of the ancient buildings, including the Bishop&#x27;s Palace, are today maintained by Cadw and open to the public.

==Geography==

The community council area sits at the southern end of the Irish Sea on a peninsula, between Cardigan Bay, St George&#x27;s Channel and St Brides Bay. It covers not just the mainland area, but also several islands off the coast, of which Ramsey Island is the largest and the only one inhabited, separated by the Ramsey Sound. The most westerly mainland point of Wales is at Pen Dal-aderyn. To the north lie Whitesands Bay and St Davids Head, which are locally notable landscape features. The community includes the former chapelries at St Justinian and Gwrhyd. The mainland contains much area used for farming, but contains very small scattered residences and several campsites.

St Davids Lifeboat Station, at St Justinian, has saved an estimated 360 people since the first lifeboat was located there in 1869; four lifeboatmen have died while saving others. The Irish Sea includes a large number of offshore rocks and islands and is notorious for strong tides. The entire coastline around St Davids forms part of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. Saint Non&#x27;s Well overlooks the Pembrokeshire Coast Path and St Brides Bay. St David&#x27;s Airfield, although named after the city when opened in 1943, is in the neighbouring community of Solva. The highest point is Carn Llidi at .

==City status==

In the 16th century, a town was recognised as a city by the English Crown if it had a diocesan cathedral within its limits, along with a royal charter or borough privileges. This link was abolished in 1888, and amid prior borough reorganisation (see Governance below), St Davids lost the right to call itself a city. In 1991, St Davids town council proposed that a case for city status, which the residents had long considered it to have anyway, should be promoted in connection with the 40th anniversary of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, and in 1992 the Home Office agreed to refer the matter to Buckingham Palace. In 1994, at the Queen&#x27;s request, St Davids was again granted city status along with the Northern Irish town of Armagh, &quot;in recognition of their important Christian heritage and their status as cities in the last century&quot;. The letters patent conferring city status were issued on 16 September 1994. The following year the Queen visited to formally present the letters patent in a ceremony at St Davids Cathedral on 1 June 1995.

The award of city status is typically granted to a local authority, whose administrative area is then considered to be the formal borders of the city. By this definition, the whole community area of St Davids and the Cathedral Close, including the settlement of St Davids, its surrounding rural area, and islands off the coast, is considered to be within the city. St Davids contains the lowest population of all the cities of the UK, and has the smallest urban area, at . However, with the formal city area defined by its community council extent of , this sizeable expanse including offshore islands mean that several UK cities are smaller in area, with the City of London being the smallest at . In Wales, St Davids is the third smallest after the community areas of St Asaph with and Bangor with .

==Governance==

St Davids became a borough in 1115, when Bernard, the first Norman Bishop of St Davids, was granted a charter by Henry I designating the lands of Dewisland as a Marcher Lordship.

This gave Bernard wide-reaching powers over this realm, with his headquarters remaining initially at St Davids. However, subsequent Marcher Bishops came to base the administration of Dewisland, including the exchequer, chancery and court, in Llawhaden by the 13th century. King Henry VIII then passed the Laws in Wales Acts, which in 1535 and 1542 abolished the status of Marcher Lordships. Dewisland was merged with the adjacent Lordship of Kemes and the surrounding Lordship of Pembroke to form Pembrokeshire, of which Dewisland became a hundred. In 1835 a report from government commissioners investigating municipal corporations determined:
THE city and parish of St. David&#x27;s is situate in the manor of Dewisland. The Bishop of St. David&#x27;s is Lord of the Manor; and it appears that an officer, called the mayor, is annually appointed by the steward, whose duty is to collect certain chief rents to the bishop. The mayor assumes to take certain small tolls by virtue of his office: his right to do this is disputed, but the tolls being very trifling, are frequently paid. The mayor is merely an officer of the Manor Court. A belief exists amongst some of the inhabitants that the city was once a corporation; but there are no burgesses, charter, or other vestige of municipal institutions. The belief has probably arisen from the lord&#x27;s officer being called a mayor.
Under this summary, the borough was considered within the report as &quot;municipal in name only&quot;, and non-parliamentary.
Any remaining legalities pertaining to the city were removed in 1886, when these were abolished by the Municipal Corporations Act 1883, with its corporation deemed to be long extinct, and the very small population (1,025 residents in 1835) not helping its cause in an age where boroughs with unrepresentative populations were being singled out for reform. This act, in turn, appears to have caused the loss of city status, as there was no corporate body available to petition for a renewal of its charter. The subsequent renewal of the status in 1994 (see City Status above) and the reasons then given conclude that the status was in place until 1886.

The borough lay across two parishes, and by the time of the creation of registration districts in 1837 these were: the Cathedral Close of St. David&#x27;s – the close surrounding the cathedral and associated church buildings; and St Davids – the rest of the city and rural areas. These were split from the church into civil parishes during 1866, electing secular councillors from 1894, converted to Welsh community administrative areas in 1974, and merged in 1987 to form the present day St Davids and the Cathedral Close.

St Davids City Council is the community council body, which has twelve councillors. The City Council employs one City Clerk and one Financial Officer. In June 2020 the council elected its first Sikh mayor, Councillor Bira Sehmi, believed also to be the first Sikh mayor in Wales. The council is based at St Davids City Hall on High Street, which was completed in 1924.

The parishes were part of Haverfordwest rural sanitary district from 1872, and when parish and district councils were established in 1894 the two parishes were included in the Haverfordwest Rural District. In 1974 the two parishes were changed into communities and placed in Preseli district. Preseli was abolished in 1996 under further local government reform and the city presently comes under Pembrokeshire County Council for all principal government services.

The electoral ward of St Davids elects a county councillor to Pembrokeshire County Council.

<text>The Constitution of Norway (complete name: The Constitution of the Kingdom of Norway; Danish: ; Norwegian Bokmål: ; Norwegian Nynorsk: ) was adopted on 16 May and signed on 17 May 1814 by the Norwegian Constituent Assembly at Eidsvoll. The latter date is the National Day of Norway; it marks the establishment of the constitution.

It is the fourth oldest written single-document national constitution in Europe after the Constitution of Poland, the French constitution of 1791, and the Spanish Constitution of 1812. The document is also the second oldest working national constitution in the world, after the Constitution of the United States. In May 2014, the Storting passed the most substantial changes since 1814, particularly by including paragraphs on human rights.

==History==

===Writing the constitution===
Until 1814, Norway was part of the Kingdom of Denmark–Norway. Following the defeat of Napoleon&#x27;s troops at the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813, the Treaty of Kiel of January 1814 ceded Norway to Sweden. In response, the Crown Prince of Denmark–Norway and resident viceroy in Norway, Christian Frederik, started a Norwegian independence movement. The most likely goal of the young Crown Prince was reunification with Denmark. His initiative was successful, and a national assembly at Eidsvoll was called. The assembled representatives were elected by the congregations of the state church and by military units throughout Norway. They convened at the Eidsvoll manor on 10 April. The constitution was written during five weeks of the spring of 1814. It was ratified by the assembly on 16 May, and signed the following day. The latter date is now celebrated as the Norwegian Constitution Day.

The Norwegian constitution was inspired by the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the French Revolution in 1789, and the subsequent U.S. and French constitutions. The authors, Christian Magnus Falsen and Johan Gunder Adler, were also influenced by the Spanish Constitution of 1812. A deviation from the republican constitutions of France and the United States was the retention of monarchy. Importing republicanism was seen as an attempt to emulate the French and Americans directly, something the lawmakers at Eidsvoll sought to avoid. The choice of monarchy as state form would also facilitate the reunification of Denmark–Norway, something the Crown Prince was not alone in seeking. The king&#x27;s power was however severely curtailed. His absolute veto over laws was removed. The council of Eidsvoll chose Crown Prince Christian Frederik as king. Christian Adolph Diriks, who was the legal secretary of the Constitutional Committee, was the assembly&#x27;s resident expert on foreign constitutions, and played an important part in shaping the language of the constitution. Diriks is credited with formulating §100, concerning freedom of speech, and §102, guarding against unreasonable searches and seizures.

The constitution shows a curious mix of radical and traditional values. The principle of separation of powers between the executive, legislative and judicial branches was directly inspired by radical ideas from the US and French systems. The retention of a king, a constitutional church, defined as Evangelical-Lutheran, and the banning of Jesuits, monastic orders, and Jews, which latter were not allowed to travel to Norway, in the face of Republicanism was a traditionalist move; however, the king&#x27;s power was severely curtailed, and the church very much under the control of the elected body. Suffrage was extended, but was still restricted to certain groups of men. All men who were either farmers possessing their own land, civil servants, or urban property owners could vote. With this, about half of all Norwegian men were granted the right to vote.

===The union with Sweden===
The young king and Norwegian officials tried to find international backing for their bid for Norway as a sovereign state throughout spring and early summer of 1814. After failing to secure the support of the United Kingdom, war with Sweden became unavoidable. The Swedish Campaign against Norway was short and decisive. However, while badly trained and equipped, the Norwegian Army put up a determined fight, holding the Swedes back at Kongsvinger and securing a tactical victory at the battle of Langnes. This enabled the King to avoid an unconditional surrender as he was forced into negotiations with the Swedes, leading to the Convention of Moss.

Putting the strategic situation and his own abdication to good use, he persuaded the Swedish crown prince Carl Johan (the former Marshal Bernadotte of France) to let the Norwegians keep their constitution. The Swedish crown prince could have named his terms to Norway, but wanted to appease the Norwegians and avoid a bloody continuation of the war. Realizing that a forced union with himself as ruler of a conquered and hostile country would be very uneasy, he accepted the Norwegian proposition. Norway then entered into a personal union with Sweden, and the constitution was amended as necessary to form the Union between Sweden and Norway. Notably, while Norway was to keep most of its own institution, the two countries were to share a common monarch and a common foreign policy.

On 7 October, an extraordinary session of the Storting convened, and king Christian Frederik delegated his powers to the parliament and abdicated on 10 October. The Storting adopted the constitutional amendments on 4 November and on the same day unanimously elected Charles XIII king of Norway, rather than acknowledging him as such, thus reinforcing the concept a King by the will of the people.

===Dissolution of the union and the new King===
The union amendments were revoked after the dissolution of the 91-year union in 1905. The question of a King was again considered, and the Storting elected to offer the throne to the 33-year-old Prince Carl of Denmark, married to Princess Maud of Wales, the daughter of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom. By bringing in a king with British royal ties, it was hoped that Norway could court Britain&#x27;s support. Additionally, Prince Carl was related on his father&#x27;s side to Norway&#x27;s medieval kings.

Prince Carl, however, was well aware of a surge of republicanism in Norway and of the constitutional situation of the Norwegian throne. He insisted that he would accept the crown only if the Norwegian people expressed their will for monarchy by referendum and if the parliament then elected him king. On 13 November, the Norwegian votes decided on monarchy with a 78.9 percent majority, and Carl was elected King by the Storting, taking the regnal name Haakon VII.

=== World War II ===

In 1942, the national socialist Minister President Vidkun Quisling, reintroduced the Jew clause, but the change was reverted after the war.

After World War II and the restoration of peace and constitutional rule, there was much debate on how to handle the events of the previous five years. None of this led to any changes in the constitution; it had withstood the test of hard times.

==Development==
While radical in its day, the constitution of 1814 was a product of its age. As Norwegian democracy developed, some parts of it began to look increasingly dated. For example, the executive power, which in the constitution is consistently attributed to the King, came increasingly to rest in his Council of State (). Similarly, the King originally had the right to appoint members of the council, who were answerable to him alone, and they could not be chosen from the members of the Storting. With the establishment of parliamentarism in 1884, the council was effectively chosen by general election, in that the King appointed only members of the party or coalition having a majority in the Storting. Further, the Council became answerable to the Storting, in the sense that a failed vote of confidence would cause the government to resign. This last happened in March 2000, when the governing coalition refused introduction of electrical power stations based on natural gas on environmental grounds, which a majority of the Storting supported.

As a relic from the earlier laws of Denmark–Norway, Article 2 in the constitution originally read, &quot;The Evangelical-Lutheran religion remains the public religion of the State. Those inhabitants, who confess thereto, are bound to raise their children to the same. Jesuits and monastic orders are not permitted. Jews are still prohibited from entry to the Realm.&quot; In 1851, the last sentence was struck out after the Norwegian poet Henrik Wergeland had campaigned for the rights of the Jews, and in 1897 also the next to last sentence. Monastic orders were permitted 1897, but the ban on Jesuits was only lifted in 1956.

Universal &quot;male&quot; suffrage was introduced in Norway in 1898 and universal suffrage in 1913 by amendments of the constitution.

Some constitutional scholars hold that it may be necessary to change the constitution if Norway is to enter the European Union, as the first article states that Norway is a &quot;free, independent&quot; country. However, the debate on the EU has been relatively quiescent since the referendum in 1994, so such a change is not likely to occur in the immediate future.

The Norwegian High Court of the Realm is warranted by the constitution and was frequently used by the Storting as a political tool to control the government during the 19th century, but no impeachments had been made since 1927. A parliamentary report and a proposition for constitutional amendment was presented in 2004 to change the legal basis of the High Court of the Realm and reduce its political bias. The proposal was passed by a unanimous Storting on 20 February 2007, and came into effect in 2009. The new court of impeachment is composed of five regular Supreme Court of Norway judges and six lay judges appointed by the Storting.

In May 2012, parliament passed a constitutional amendment, for the second time, to separate church and state. This formally made Norway a secular country with no official religion, although the Church of Norway is still mentioned in the Constitution. Article 12 in the constitution, which stated that more than half of the persons in the Council of State had to be members of the state church was also repealed.

In the run-up for the 200th anniversary for the Constitution, work was done to see if the Constitution could be amended to be more in tune with the times. In December 2011, a Committee appointed by the Storting put forth its report, suggesting that human rights be put in a separate chapter in the Constitution.

In 2014, 200 years after the constitution was written, a chapter on human rights was added as well as being rewritten into modern Bokmål and Nynorsk.

==Language==
The events and the constitution of 1814 have a central place in Norwegian identity. For this reason, and to keep the text as consistent as possible, changes prior to the language revision in 2014 were written in a language close to the original. In 1814, Danish was still the universal written language in Norway. The current two official varieties of written Norwegian, Bokmål and Nynorsk (until 1929 called Riksmål and Landsmål respectively), were not developed until the late 19th century. Additionally, in 1903, the constitution underwent a very slight linguistic revision, changing the spelling of some words where orthography had changed since 1814 but still using conservative 19th century Danish.

All amendments prior to 2014 have attempted to imitate the language of the 1903 version, leading to peculiar constructions. The word &quot;environment&quot; was written with the archaic spelling &quot;Milieu&quot;, differing from modern Norwegian and Danish ; the modern context of that word was, however, non-existent in the 19th century. The &quot;Sami ethnic group&quot; was &quot;&quot;, even though the word &quot;Sami&quot; () was not common until the 1970s. In 1814 and 1903, the word Lappish () would have been used. In February 2006, a constitutional amendment was aimed at reverting 16 minor spelling errors to the proper 1903 forms.

Different approaches to revise the language throughout the document were suggested:
* Bring the language up to today&#x27;s usage and orthography.
* Use the 1903 standard but correct various passages where newer amendments do not really conform to that standard.
* Revert the language to the standard of 1814; an objection to this is that most modern Norwegians would find it even more difficult to read.
* Update the language to one of the spelling reforms, 1917, 1938, or 1959. This would still be fairly conservative language but closer to today&#x27;s speech.

In 2014, when the language in the constitution was officially revised they went with the first approach, which produced an updated Bokmål version and a completely new modern Nynorsk version. The Nynorsk version was compiled by a committee headed by professor Hans Petter Graver. These are based on propositions 21, 22 and 25. Before this, the official name of the Kingdom of Norway (, ) would have been &quot;Kongeriget Norge&quot;, as in the modern Danish form if taken literally from the old constitution.

The Norwegian constitution has a version written in English, provided by the Storting.

==Rituals relating to the Constitution==

===Constitution Day===

17 May, the date of the signing of the constitution, is celebrated as Norwegian Constitution Day with the school children&#x27;s flag parades. In the capital Oslo, the parade passes the Royal Palace where thousands of schoolchildren wave to the King and Queen. A notable feature of the Norwegian Constitution Day celebration is the virtual absence of any military parades, the day being almost wholly a civilian celebration.

===The State Opening of the Parliament===
Each autumn the Storting is formally opened by the King. In an election year, the session starts with representatives for each county being formally recognised as the lawful representatives. This happens every fourth year (the Norwegian Constitution does not allow for intra-period snap elections).

After the session is opened and a secretary and president are elected for the period, the King addresses the representatives with the (&#x27;Speech from the Throne&#x27;) in his capacity as formal head of state. The summarizes the government&#x27;s program for the coming year, and while delivered by the King, is written by the sitting government. The is followed by a general debate, where the opposition states their main points for the year to come. Following the debate, the youngest member of the cabinet reads The Report on the State of the Realm.

==Summary of text==

The current text of the Constitution (as amended in May 2018) consists of 121 articles, grouped into chapters A to F.

Chapter A consists of Articles 1 and 2, which state that Norway is &quot;a free, independent, indivisible and inalienable realm&quot; with &quot;a limited and hereditary monarchy.&quot; The state&#x27;s values are its &quot;Christian and humanist heritage,&quot; democracy and &quot;the rule of law and human rights.&quot; The mention of humanist values was made due to the popularity of secular humanism in Norway and the importance of secular ethics to millions of Norwegians.

Chapter B is about the King (or Queen), the royal family, the Council of State and the Church of Norway. It consists of Articles 3 to 48. It states that the King must &quot;at all times profess the Evangelical-Lutheran religion.&quot; He may not leave the state for longer than six months without the council&#x27;s permission, otherwise he automatically forfeits the Crown. It sets out the line of succession, and provides that if the line of succession dies out then the Storting shall elect a new king. It sets out the King&#x27;s coronation oath.

Executive power is vested in the King, but the government is conducted in his name by a Council of State, and all of his decisions must be counter-signed by an official. The Council consists of at least eight members chosen by the King, including the Prime Minister. Members must be Norwegian citizens who are eligible to vote. More than half the members must be present to conduct business, but if not enough members are present then temporary members may be appointed. In the event of a tied vote, the Prime Minister or, in his absence, the council&#x27;s highest-ranking member, has a second and casting vote. Two spouses, two siblings, or a parent and child may not be members at the same time. The Storting may pass a vote of no confidence in any member or in the whole Council, at which point the member or members must resign. The heir to the throne, if over 18, has a seat in the council but no vote.

If the King is absent from the realm or is too ill to carry out his duties, then the heir to the throne (if over 18) may act in his place; afterwards he is accountable for his actions to the King and to the Storting. If the heir is under 18 then the Council exercises the King&#x27;s powers.

The King may pass temporary ordinances about commerce, customs, &quot;all livelihoods&quot; and public administration. These remain in force until the next Storting.

The King in Council may pardon criminals after they have been sentenced, except in cases of impeachment. In proceedings on impeachment, he may not pardon the defendant unless the Storting consents. (He may commute a death sentence without the Storting&#x27;s consent, but the death penalty is now prohibited by Article 93.)

The King is commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and he appoints all civil and military officers, after consulting the council. Royal princes and princesses are disqualified from holding office. The King may, after consulting the council, dismiss the Prime Minister and other members of the council, and other senior government and military officials. He may appoint his own household officials at his own discretion. He may honour people for distinguished service, but not grant hereditary privileges.

The armed forces may not be deployed outside the realm, nor may foreign forces be allowed into the realm (except to defend it from attack), without the Storting&#x27;s consent.

A prince or princess may not marry without the King&#x27;s consent; contravention of that rule disqualifies them from succession to the throne. They &quot;shall not be personally answerable to anyone other than the King&quot; or a person delegated by him.

Article 16 says that the Church of Norway is the Established Church, &quot;and will as such be supported by the State.&quot; However it also guarantees the right of all inhabitants of the realm to freely exercise their own religion. Article 33 states that Norges Bank is the central bank of Norway.

Chapter C (Articles 49 to 85) is about the Storting and the rights of citizens.

Legislative power is vested in the Storting, which consists of one house containing 169 members, elected every four years in free and secret elections. All Norwegian citizens who are aged 18 or over are eligible to vote. Article 50 guarantees this right to men and women. However the right to vote may be qualified by law in the case of citizens who are resident overseas, mentally ill or in &quot;a reduced level of consciousness,&quot; and the right to vote may be lost by convicted criminals (in circumstances prescribed by law) and by citizens who serve in a foreign government without the Norwegian government&#x27;s consent.

There are 19 parliamentary constituencies. 150 seats are apportioned to each constituency according to a calculation (made every eight years) based on their population density. Those members are elected by proportional representation. No party may have a seat unless it wins at least four percent of the vote nationwide. The other 19 members are elected by each constituency at large, one for each constituency. No-one may be a member of the Storting unless they are eligible to vote. Judges of the Supreme Court and most government officials are not eligible for membership.

The members of the Council of State are not members of the Storting, but have the right to attend and take part on debate (but not to vote).

Members of the Storting are privileged from arrest during their attendance and while travelling to and from the Storting, &quot;unless they are apprehended in public crimes.&quot; They are not accountable for the opinions they express in the Storting. The Storting shall meet in the capital every year on the first weekday of October, unless the King designates another town due to an emergency. The King may also summon the Storting at other times if necessary. Each new Storting is opened by the King, or a person delegated by him, who makes a speech about the state of the realm. The Storting meets in open session, and its decisions are published, unless it decides otherwise.

The Storting appoints a person (not a member) to supervise the public administration.

The Storting has the power to naturalise aliens.

Any member of the Storting or member of the Council of State may propose a bill. To become law, a bill must be debated twice, with at least three days between each debate, and then presented to the King for his assent. If the Kings signs it, it becomes law (and it is then published under the Seal of the Realm). The King may veto a bill, but his veto may be overridden if the bill is passed in the same form by the next elected Storting.

Article 85 states that &quot;Any person who obeys an order the purpose of which is to disturb the liberty and security of the Storting is thereby guilty of treason against the country.&quot;

Chapter D (Articles 86 to 91) vests the judicial power in a Supreme Court and a Court of Impeachment.

The Supreme Court consists of a President and at least four other members, who must be at least 30 years of age. The Supreme Court&#x27;s decisions are final and cannot be appealed.

The Court of Impeachment hears proceedings brought by the Storting against members of the Storting, members of the Council of State and members of the Supreme Court &quot;for criminal or other unlawful conduct.&quot; The Court consists of the five longest-serving permanent members of the Supreme Court, including its President (who also presides over this court), and six other members elected by the Storting for six years. A member of the Storting or of the Council of State may not be elected to the Court.

Chapter E (Articles 92 to 113) sets out various human rights. Article 95 requires the state authorities to ensure the independence of the courts and the judges. Article 108 requires the state authorities to help the Sami people preserve their language, culture and way of life.

Chapter F (Articles 114 to 121) makes various other provisions, including for amendment of the Constitution.

To be eligible for high office, a person must not only be a Norwegian citizen but also speak Norwegian and meet certain other requirements. Citizens may be required to serve in defence of the country for a specified time. The national flag is to be prescribed by law. No new titles of nobility may be created.

Under Article 121, amendments to the Constitution may be proposed to the first, second or third annual Storting following a general election. If passed by two thirds of the Storting, the amendment must be signed by the King and by the Secretary to the Storting, and published. But an amendment must not &quot;contradict the principles embodied in&quot; the Constitution, or &quot;alter the spirit of the Constitution.&quot;

<text>Cosmic Slop is the fifth studio album by Funkadelic, released in July 1973 on Westbound Records. While it has been favorably reevaluated by critics long after its original release, the album was a commercial failure, producing no charting singles, and reaching only #112 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart and #21 on the R&amp;B chart. The album was re-released on CD in 1991.

&quot;Cosmic Slop&quot; is the first Funkadelic album to feature artwork and liner notes by Pedro Bell, who assumed responsibility for the band&#x27;s gate-fold album covers and liner notes until the band&#x27;s collapse after 1981&#x27;s &quot;The Electric Spanking of War Babies&quot;. Bell&#x27;s liner notes to &quot;Cosmic Slop&quot; include small illustrations next to each song&#x27;s name, summarizing the song in a picture. The album also marks the first Funkadelic album without any input from longtime guitarist Eddie Hazel, who had left the band the year before.

Lloyd Bradley in Q Magazine characterised the album a &quot;cornerstone ... coming just before James Brown sidepersons began defecting to Clinton&#x27;s outfit&#x27; and &quot;a link between fearsomely dark musings and out-and-out strangeness&quot;.

<text>The Indigenous Dialogues Foundation (Indiĝenaj Dialogoj or ID) was an international project which sought to empower organisations of indigenous peoples worldwide to communicate directly, freely, and affordably, allowing them to more effectively work together for their common interests.

ID provided internet connectivity and taught courses in Esperanto as an international bridge language. Esperanto was chosen rather than a major national language such as English because it is nationally neutral and relatively easy to master, while still backed and proven by an existing infrastructure—over a century of Esperanto culture—and its surface similarities to major European languages facilitate the learning of regional and world languages such as English, Spanish, or Russian.

Bessie Schadee and Sylvain Lelarge of the Netherlands and José Carlos Morales of the Brunka (Boruca) people of Costa Rica started ID in 1998; two worldwide and five regional courses were held from 1999 to 2001, with representatives from over twenty peoples. ID was supported by a number of international organizations, banks, governments, and private individuals.

The project also had close ties to Universal Esperanto Association in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The Dutch Ministry for Foreign Affairs monthly magazine &quot;IS - International Samenwerking&quot; (International Cooperation) dedicated almost an entire page of its October 1999 number to the project, Universal Esperanto Association wrote in a press release in October 1999.

The article was titled &quot;Esperanto Builds a Bridge Between Cultures,&quot; with the subtitle &quot;A Course on Communication for Indigenous Peoples.&quot; It described ID&#x27;s aims and reports on the first course with representatives of 18 peoples. At the end of the article Snam Stanley Iko from Papua New Guinea summed up ID&#x27;s philosophy: &quot;I believe that Esperanto can build bridges between people, because the world has a language problem. One person speaks this and the other speaks that, but we have to learn to understand each other and the world.&quot;

In 2000 a long-awaited Dutch grant was not received. After this and other hardships the project finally ceased to exist in the year 2002.

<text>The original incarnation of News Corporation (abbreviated News Corp. and also variously known as News Corporation Limited) was an American multinational mass media corporation controlled by media mogul Rupert Murdoch and headquartered at 1211 Avenue of the Americas in New York City. Prior to its split in 2013, it was the world&#x27;s largest media company in terms of total assets and the world&#x27;s fourth largest media group in terms of revenue. It had become a media powerhouse since its inception, dominating the news, television, film, and print industries.

Formerly incorporated in Adelaide, South Australia, the company was re-incorporated under Delaware General Corporation Law after a majority of shareholders approved the move on November 12, 2004. News Corporation was headquartered at 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, in the newer 1960s–1970s corridor of the Rockefeller Center complex.

On June 28, 2012, after concerns from shareholders in response to its recent controversies and to &quot;unlock even greater long-term shareholder value&quot;, founder Rupert Murdoch announced that News Corporation&#x27;s assets would be restructured into two publicly traded companies, one oriented towards media, and the other towards publishing. The formal split was completed on June 28, 2013; the original News Corp. was renamed 21st Century Fox and consisted primarily of media outlets, while the second News Corporation was formed to take on the publishing and Australian broadcasting assets. Fox Corporation became the successor to 21st Century Fox in 2019 after Disney acquired majority of the latter&#x27;s assets; it holds News Corporation&#x27;s television broadcasting, news, and sports assets.

Its major holdings at the time of the split were News Limited (a group of newspaper publishers in Murdoch&#x27;s native Australia), News International (a newspaper publisher in the United Kingdom, whose properties include &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Sun&quot;, and the now-defunct &quot;News of the World&quot; (the subject of a phone hacking scandal that led to its closure in July 2011), Dow Jones &amp; Company (an American publisher of financial news outlets, including &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;), the book publisher HarperCollins, and the Fox Entertainment Group (the holding for the 20th Century Fox Film Corporation and the Fox Broadcasting Company).

==History==
News Corp was established in 1980 by Rupert Murdoch as a holding company for News Limited. News Limited was founded in 1923 in Adelaide by James Edward Davidson, funded by the Collins House mining empire for the purpose of publishing anti-union propaganda; subsequently the controlling interest was bought by the Herald &amp; Weekly Times. In 1949, Keith Murdoch took control of Adelaide&#x27;s afternoon tabloid &quot;The News&quot;. When he died in 1952, his son Rupert inherited a controlling interest in &quot;The News&quot;. News Limited operates today as News Corporation&#x27;s Australian brand and includes ownership of &quot;The Australian,&quot; operating out of Surry Hills, in Sydney.

===Expansion into the United States===
News Ltd. made its first acquisition in the United States in 1973, when it purchased the &quot;San Antonio Express and News&quot; (the two papers merged in 1984). Soon afterwards it founded the &quot;National Star&quot;, a supermarket tabloid, and in 1976 it purchased the &quot;New York Post&quot; from Dorothy Schiff for $31 million.

In 1984, News Corp acquired the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; from Field Enterprises (later sold in 1986 to the American Publishing Company subsidiary of Canada-based Hollinger) for $90 million and &quot;Travel Weekly&quot; and other trade magazines from Ziff Davis. In March 1985, News Corp bought a 50% stake in TCF Holdings, the holding company of the movie studio 20th Century Fox from Marc Rich for $162 million, and later acquired the remaining stake from Marvin Davis in September for $325 million.

Two months after the acquisition of the 50% stake in TCF Holdings, on May 6, 1985, News Corp announced it was buying the Metromedia television stations and its syndication arm Metromedia Producers Corporation from John Kluge for $3.5 billion, setting the stage for the launch of a fourth U.S. commercial broadcasting television network. On September 4, 1985, Murdoch became a naturalized citizen to satisfy the legal requirement that only United States citizens could own American television stations. In 1986, the Metromedia deal was completed, and the Fox Broadcasting Company, simply known as Fox, launched on October 9, with Joan Rivers&#x27; &quot;The Late Show&quot; as its late-night program, it would later air prime-time programming starting in April 1987.

===Expansion and consolidation===
In 1986 and 1987, News Corp (through subsidiary News International) moved to adjust the production process of its British newspapers, over which the printing unions had long dominated. A number of senior Australian media moguls were brought into Murdoch&#x27;s powerhouse, including John Dux, who was managing director of the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot;. This led to a confrontation with the printing unions National Graphical Association and Society of Graphical and Allied Trades. The move of News International&#x27;s London operation to Wapping in the East End resulted in nightly battles outside the new plant. Delivery vans and depots were frequently and violently attacked. Ultimately the unions capitulated.

In 1987, News Corp acquired the book publisher Harper and Row for $300 million, and later acquired the British book publisher William Collins, Sons in 1989 for $721 million, who later merged with Harper to form HarperCollins that same year.

In 1988, News Corp acquired the Philadelphia-based Triangle Publications, publisher of the magazines &quot;TV Guide&quot;, &quot;Seventeen&quot;, and the &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot; for $3 billion. To raise money, the trade publications were sold to Reed International.

By 1992, News Corp had incurred large debts, which forced it to sell many of the American magazine interests it had acquired in the mid-1980s to K-III Communications, as well spinning off long-held Australian magazines interests as Pacific Magazines. Much of this debt came from its stake in the Sky Television satellite network in the UK, which incurred massive losses in its early years of operation, which (like many of its business interests) was heavily subsidised with profits from its other holdings until it was able to force rival satellite operator BSB to accept a merger on its terms in 1990. (The merged company, BSkyB, has dominated the British pay-TV market since.)

In 1993, News Corp acquired a 63.6% stake of the Hong Kong-based STAR TV satellite network from Pearson for over $500 million, followed by the purchase of the remaining 36.4% in July 1995. Murdoch declared that:

In 1995, the Fox network became the object of scrutiny from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) when it was alleged that its Australian base made Murdoch&#x27;s ownership of Fox illegal. The FCC, however, ruled in Murdoch&#x27;s favor, stating that his ownership of Fox was in the public&#x27;s best interests. It was also noted that the stations themselves were owned by a separate company whose chief shareholder was a U.S. citizen, Murdoch, although nearly all of the stations&#x27; equity was controlled by News Corp. In the same year, News Corporation announced a deal with MCI Communications to develop a major news website as well as funding a conservative news magazine, &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;. In the same year, News Corp launched the Foxtel pay television network in Australia in a partnership with Telstra and Publishing &amp; Broadcasting Limited.

On July 17, 1996, News Corporation announced that it would acquire television production and broadcasting company New World Communications (who acquired a 20% stake in 1994 for $200 million), for $2.48 billion in stock and was completed on January 22, 1997.

On October 7, 1996, the Fox Entertainment Group launched the Fox News Channel, a 24-hour cable news network to compete against Time Warner&#x27;s rival channel CNN.

In 1999, News Corporation significantly expanded its music holdings in Australia by acquiring the controlling share in a leading Australian-based label, Michael Gudinski&#x27;s Mushroom Records, merging it with already held Festival Records to create Festival Mushroom Records (FMR). Both Festival and FMR were managed by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s son James Murdoch for several years.

Also mid 1999, &quot;The Economist&quot; reported that News Corp paid comparatively lower taxes, and Newscorp Investments specifically had made £11.4 billion ($20.1 billion) in profits over the previous 11 years but had not paid net corporation tax. It also reported that after an examination of the available accounts, Newscorp could normally have been expected to pay corporate tax of approximately $350 million. The article explained that in practice, the corporation&#x27;s complex structure, international scope, and use of offshore tax havens allowed News Corporation to pay minimal taxes.

===Further development===
In late 2003, News Corp acquired a 34% stake in Hughes Electronics (now DirecTV Group), operator of the largest American satellite TV system, from General Motors for US$6 billion. DirecTV was sold to Liberty Media in 2008 in exchange for its stake in News Corporation.

In January 2005, shortly after reincorporation in the United States, News Corporation announced that it was buying out Fox Entertainment Group. The manoeuvre delisted Fox from the New York Stock Exchange; Fox had traded on the NYSE under the ticker FOX.

In 2004, Murdoch set aside $2 billion and handpicked a team of young executives to look at possible ways to use the Web as a distribution platform. That team was composed of four rising stars: Ross Levinsohn, Adam Bain, Travis Katz, and Michael Kirby. The four became the backbone of what would become News Corp&#x27;s digital division, Fox Interactive Media.

Shortly after, in July 2005, News Corporation purchased the social networking website Myspace for $580 million. News Corporation had beat out Viacom by offering a higher price for the website, and the purchase was seen as a good investment at the time. Of the $580 million purchase price, approximately $327 million has been attributed to the value of Myspace according to the financial adviser fairness opinion. Within a year, Myspace had tripled in value from its purchase price.

In February 2007, Murdoch announced at the McGraw-Hill Media Summit that the Fox Entertainment Group would launch a new business news channel later in the year, which would compete directly against rival network CNBC. Murdoch explained that the channel would be more &quot;business-friendly&quot; than CNBC, because he felt that they &quot;leap on every scandal, or what they think is a scandal.&quot; In July 2007, News Corp. reached a deal to acquire Dow Jones &amp; Company, owners of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, for $5 billion. Despite CNBC already having a contract with Dow Jones to provide content and services to the network, the Fox Entertainment Group officially launched the Fox Business Network on October 15, 2007. Alexis Glick, the network&#x27;s original morning show host and vice president of business news, indicated that its lawyers had reviewed the details of Dow Jones&#x27; contract with CNBC, but noted that it would still &quot;actively use&quot; other Dow Jones properties.

On December 16, 2008, News Corporation announced that it would transfer its US shares from the NYSE to the NASDAQ which was made effective two weeks later. In September 2009, News Corp established NewsCore, a global wire service set up to provide news stories to all of News Corp&#x27;s journalistic outlets.

In April 2010, News Corporation sold Bulgarian broadcaster bTV, which it launched on 1 June 2000, as part of a deal to Central European Media Enterprises (CME) for $400 million in addition to another $13 million for working capital adjustment. The deal included cable channels bTV Comedy and Btv Cinema and News Corporation&#x27;s 74% stake in Radio Company CJ which included five radio stations.

In September 2010, due to the Fijian government&#x27;s requirement that the country&#x27;s media outlet must be 90% owned by Fiji Nationals, News Corporation sold 90% of their stake in their Fijian newspapers (&quot;Fiji Times&quot;, &quot;Nai Lalakai&quot;, and &quot;Shanti Dut&quot;) to Motibhai Group of Companies.

In November 2010, News Corp purchased education technology and student progress tracking company Wireless Generation for $360 million. The company was the NY City Education Department&#x27;s partner for its School of One pilot program (now Teach to One).

In late February 2011, News Corp officially put the now-struggling Myspace up for sale, which was estimated to be worth $50–200 million. Losses from the last quarter of 2010 were $156 million, over double of the previous year, which dragged down the otherwise strong results of parent News Corp. Its struggles were attributed to the growth of the competing social network Facebook. The deadline for bids, May 31, 2011, passed without any above the reserve price of $100 million being submitted. The rapid deterioration in Myspace&#x27;s business during the most recent quarter had deterred many potent suitors. Later in June, Specific Media and pop singer Justin Timberlake bought the site for $35 million, which CNN reported noted was &quot;far less than the $580 million News Corp. paid for Myspace in 2005.&quot; Murdoch went on to call the Myspace purchase a &quot;huge mistake&quot;.

On July 13, 2011, Rupert Murdoch announced that the company would withdraw its takeover bid for BSkyB due to concerns relating to the &quot;News of the World&quot; scandal. News Corporation already owned, and continues to own, 39.1% of BSkyB.

On June 6, 2012, News Corporation announced that it would buy out ESPN Inc.&#x27;s stake in ESPN Star Sports to gain full control over the Asia-Pacific sports network. On November 20, 2012, News Corporation announced that it would acquire a 49% stake in the regional sports network YES Network, owned by the Major League Baseball team New York Yankees. In January 2013, News Corp. attained 54.5% majority control of Sky Deutschland.

On February 4, 2013, News Corporation announced the sale of IGN and its related properties to the publishing company Ziff Davis. News Corp. had planned to spin off IGN as an independent company, but failed to do so.

===Scandals===
In July 2011, News Corp closed down the &quot;News of the World&quot; newspaper in the United Kingdom due to allegations of phone hackings. The allegations include trying to access former Prime Minister Gordon Brown&#x27;s voice mail, and obtain information from his bank accounts, family&#x27;s medical records, and private legal files. Allegations of hacking have also been brought up in relation to former Prime Minister Tony Blair, and the Royal Family. Other allegations put out by &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper include the exploitation, with intent to gain access to or use private information, of a list of 4,332 names or partial names, 2,987 mobile phone numbers, 30 audio tapes of varying length and 91 PIN codes, of a kind required to access the voicemail of the minority of targets who change the factory settings on their mobile phones. The names are said to include those of British victims of September 11, 2001 terror attacks, family members of victims of the &quot;7/7&quot; bombings on London&#x27;s transit system, family members of British troops killed overseas, Milly Dowler, a 13-year-old missing British girl who was later found dead, actor Hugh Grant and a lawyer representing the family of Princess Diana&#x27;s lover at the inquest into her death. On July 13, 2011, News Corp withdrew its bid to purchase the final 61% stake in BSkyB after pressure from both the Labour and Conservative Parties in Parliament.

Allegations about the violation of ethical standards by the News Corporation subsidiary &quot;News of the World&quot; have been speculatively applied to News Corporation holdings in the United States. Senator John Rockefeller (D-WV) stated on July 12, 2011, that there should be a government investigation into News Corporation &quot;to ensure that Americans have not had their privacy violated.&quot; His statement was echoed on Wednesday by Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ), who specifically requested an investigation into 9/11 victims, as well as Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) who encouraged an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. On July 13, 2011, Representative Peter King (R-NY) wrote a letter to the FBI requesting an investigation into News Corporation&#x27;s ethical practices, and on July 14, the FBI opened a probe into the hacking of 9/11 victims. Les Hinton, chief executive of the media group&#x27;s Dow Jones, resigned on July 15, saying, &quot;I have seen hundreds of news reports of both actual and alleged misconduct during the time I was executive chairman of News International and responsible for the company. The pain caused to innocent people is unimaginable. That I was ignorant of what apparently happened is irrelevant and in the circumstances I feel it is proper for me to resign from News Corp, and apologize to those hurt by the actions of the News of the World.&quot;

In 2012, following a BBC &quot;Panorama&quot; report, allegations were made that News Corp subsidiary NDS Group had used hackers to undermine pay TV rivals around the world. Some of the victims of the alleged hacking, such as Austar, were later taken over by News Corp and others such as Ondigital later went bust. NDS had originally been set up to provide security to News Corp&#x27;s pay TV interests but emails obtained by Fairfax Media revealed they had also pursued a wider agenda by distributing the keys to rival set-top box operators and seeking to obtain phone records of suspected rivals. The emails were from the hard drive of NDS European chief Ray Adams. In 2012, it was also revealed that Australian Federal police were working with UK police to investigate hacking by News Corp.

===Split and Reorganization===

On June 28, 2012, Rupert Murdoch announced that, after concerns from shareholders in response to the recent scandals and to &quot;unlock even greater long-term shareholder value&quot;, News Corporation&#x27;s assets would be restructured into two publicly traded companies, one oriented towards media, and the other towards publishing. News Corp&#x27;s publishing operations were spun out into a new News Corporation with Robert James Thomson, editor of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, as CEO. The original News Corporation, which retained most of its media properties (such as the Fox Entertainment Group and 20th Century Fox) and Murdoch as CEO, was renamed 21st Century Fox. Murdoch remained chairman for both companies.

Shareholders approved the split on June 11, 2013. On June 19, 2013, preliminary trading for the new News Corporation on the Australian Securities Exchange commenced in preparation for the formal split that was finalized on June 28, 2013. Shareholders received one share of new News Corp for every four shares they owned of the old News Corp. The two new companies began trading on the Nasdaq on July 1, 2013. In early 2014, 21st Century Fox entered talks for a possible merger with Time Warner before abandoning efforts on August 5, 2014. In 2015, 21st Century Fox and National Geographic Society formed a joint venture group to control National Geographic&#x27;s media properties, with 21CF retaining a 73% stake in the company&#x27;s media assets In 2017, after months of speculation, Disney announced its intent to acquire 21st Century Fox. Comcast and Disney engaged in a contested bidding war to acquire the media conglomerate, but Comcast eventually rescinded efforts to acquire 21st Century Fox after 21CF agreed to Disney&#x27;s US$71.3 billion offer. With the acquisition set to complete by March 20, 2019, 21st Century Fox and Comcast engaged in a bidding war over Sky. While Comcast was unsuccessful in outbidding Disney to acquire 21CF, it acquired Sky in 2018, and 21CF sold its shares to Comcast. On March 19, 2019, the broadcasting, sports, and news assets of 21CF were spun off to Fox Corporation, a separate company, on March 19, 2019 to avoid anti-trust issues for Disney. 21CF&#x27;s remaining media assets were completely acquired by Disney on March 20, 2019, and assets with the &quot;Fox&quot; branding were subsequently renamed to avoid confusion with Fox Corporation. After Disney completed its acquisition, 21st Century Fox as a legal entity ceased existence on March 20, 2019. 

== Corporate affairs ==

=== Business trends ===
The key trends for News Corporation are (as of the financial year ending June 30):
=== Shareholders ===
*In August 2005, the Murdoch family owned only about 29% of the company of which as of June 2013 had been diluted to around 17%. However, nearly all of these shares were voting shares which currently stand at 39% of the total voting shares, and Rupert Murdoch retained effective control of the company. Nonetheless, John Malone of Liberty Media had built up a large stake, with about half of the shares being voting shares. Therefore, in November 2006, News Corporation announced its intention to transfer its 38.5% interest in DirecTV Group to John Malone&#x27;s Liberty Media; in return it bought back Liberty&#x27;s 16.3% stake in News Corp., giving Murdoch tighter control of the latter firm. Murdoch sold 17.5 million class A shares in December 2007.
*Another major stakeholder has been Al-Waleed bin Talal, of the Saudi Royal Family. In 1997, &quot;Time&quot; reported that Al-Waleed owned about five percent of News Corporation. In 2010, Alwaleed&#x27;s stake in News Corp. was about 7 percent, amounting to $3 billion. In 2013, News Corp. had a $175 million (19 percent) investment in Al-Waleed&#x27;s Rotana Group, the Arab world&#x27;s largest entertainment company. Al-Waleed sold all his shares in November 2017

=== Annual conference ===
News Corporation organized an annual management conference, discussing media issues related to geopolitics. Attendees included News Corporation executives, senior journalists, politicians and celebrities. Previous events were in Cancún, Mexico, and the Hayman Island off the coast of Australia. The events were private and secretive, there are no records available for the agenda or talks given at the conferences, and no uninvited journalists are permitted access.

The 2006 event in Pebble Beach, California was led by Rupert Murdoch. According to a copy of the agenda leaked to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and other media accounts, issues discussed related from Europe to broadcasting and new media, terrorism to the national policy. The event included speeches from Murdoch, Actor and former governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Bono, Al Gore, Senator John McCain and Bill Clinton while Israel&#x27;s President, Shimon Peres, appeared on a panel named &quot;Islam and the West&quot;. Other notable attendees included Newt Gingrich and Nicole Kidman.

=== Corporate governance ===

The company&#x27;s Board of Directors consisted of 17 individuals at the time of its break up: 
*Rupert Murdoch (Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer)
*José María Aznar (Former Prime Minister of Spain)
*Natalie Bancroft (Director)
*Peter Barnes
*James W. Breyer
*Chase Carey (President and Chief Operating Officer)
*Elaine Chao
*David F. DeVoe (Chief Financial Officer)
*Viet Dinh
*Sir Roderick Ian Eddington
*Joel I. Klein (Executive Vice President)
*James Murdoch (Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer, Europe &amp; Asia)
*Lachlan Murdoch
*Álvaro Uribe (Former President of Colombia)
*Stanley S. Shuman (Director Emeritus)
*Arthur M. Siskind (Director Emeritus, Senior Advisor to the Chairman)
*Daniel Suárez García (Chairman and CEO, Latin America)Political donations
In anticipation of US midterm elections, News Corporation donated $1 million to the Republican Governors Association in June 2010. The move was criticized by Democrats, who said this was evidence of News Corporation&#x27;s news outlets conservative leanings (see Fox News Channel controversies). The Democratic Governors Association also criticized the donation and demanded more transparency in the reporting by News Corporation companies. DGA head Nathan Daschle wrote to the chairman of News Corporation company Fox News, Roger Ailes: &quot;In the interest of some fairness and balance, I request that you add a formal disclaimer to your coverage any time any of your programs covers governors or gubernatorial races between now and election day.&quot;

Around the same time, News Corporation also donated $1 million to the United States Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber aggressively supported the Republican effort to retake Congress in 2010. This donation and an earlier $1 million contribution that News Corporation made to the Republican Governor&#x27;s Association led media critics to question whether the company had crossed an ethical line for a media company.

==Final holdings==
News Corporation split up to 21st Century Fox and the current incarnation of News Corporation on June 28, 2013. All media and broadcasting assets, except media assets owned by News Limited, now belong to Fox Corporation, the legal successor to News Corporation (and 21st Century Fox). Meanwhile, newspapers and other publishing assets, including media assets under News Limited, were spun off and belong to News Corp.
