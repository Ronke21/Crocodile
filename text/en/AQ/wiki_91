==Transportation==
Allerton was served by Iowa Highway 40 until it was turned over to Wayne County and made a county road. There is a network of paved farm to market roads starting in Allerton and connecting with the surrounding towns.

Allerton was a division point on the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad until the bankruptcy of the line in 1980. The old Golden State Route that ran east from Allerton through Seymour, Fairfield and Chicago was then abandoned. There had been some talk of relaying the track from Allerton to Seymour on the old Rock Island right of way to provide a connection between the Canadian Pacific (old Milwaukee Road) and the Union Pacific. This idea has since been dropped due to the objections of the adjacent landowners. The remaining line is now known as Union Pacific&#x27;s Spine Line. It was purchased by the Chicago &amp; Northwestern after the bankruptcy as a direct line between Kansas City and Minneapolis. It has seen a marked increase in traffic since the Chicago &amp; Northwestern merger with Union Pacific. The last passenger train on the old Rock Island system through Allerton was the Plainsman from Kansas City to Des Moines and Minneapolis. It was discontinued in 1970.

==History==
Allerton was platted by the Rock Island Railroad in when it came through the area in 1870. It became a legal town in 1874 and had a peak population of 1,600 in 1913. Allerton and Corydon were rivals for the Wayne County seat. On several occasions, during the early establishment of the two towns, county records were moved back and forth, sometimes illegally, before Corydon was declared the county seat.

The southeastern side of the town was heavily damaged by an EF2 tornado on March 5, 2022.

==Education==
Wayne Community School District operates public schools serving the community.

==Transportation==
Corydon is served by Iowa Highways 2 and 14 which make up the southern, eastern and northeastern portion of the town square.

Rail service through Corydon is provided by the Union Pacific Railroad. Since the Union Pacific merged with the Chicago and North Western Railway (C&amp;NW) in 1995, there has been a considerable increase in rail traffic on the line. The line was originally the Rock Island&#x27;s Short line from Allerton to Minneapolis. After the Rock Island ceased operations, its main track between Kansas City and Allerton was combined with the Short Line to form C&amp;NW&#x27;s &quot;Spine Line&quot; between Kansas City and Minneapolis and that designation has been retained by Union Pacific. The Rock Island depot was removed in the late 1950s with passenger service provided through Allerton, six miles to the southwest until about 1970.

Corydon was also served by the CB&amp;Q Railroad. The line originally was the Keokuk &amp; Western line from Humeston in the northwest part of Wayne County through Corydon, Promise City, Centerville and into northeastern Missouri. It then became part of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. The line was abandoned between Corydon and Centerville in 1958. The line was completely abandoned from Corydon to Humeston in the early 1970s. Depot service was maintained until abandonment, the last few years by a mobile depot that serviced Humeston, Mt. Ayr, Corydon, and Leon on set days of the week. The CB&amp;Q and Rock Island depots in Corydon were just 1/4 mile apart, with the Rock Island depot being on Depot Street at the end of Greeley Street. The Burlington depot still existed as a warehouse into the 2010s but has been razed.

<text>Lineville is a city in Wayne County, Iowa, United States. The population was 195 at the time of the 2020 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==History==
Lineville has been called the oldest town in Wayne County, but was not noted on early maps or in the 1850 state line survey, and probably attracted settlers from a nearby short-lived community called Grand River after the state line dispute was settled. Lineville was platted in 1858.

Because part of the town is in Missouri and part in Iowa, it was named Lineville. The town square sits on the Iowa–Missouri border with the business on the south side of the square in South Lineville, Missouri. When Wayne County was dry, liquor by the drink could be purchased at the bars on the Missouri side of the square.

During the 1968 Illinois earthquake, the quake was felt as a long shaking in Lineville. The quake damaged the town&#x27;s water tower which began to leak 300 gallons of water an hour.

Lineville used to be part of ACL Community Schools for the three namesake towns of Allerton, Clio and Lineville until 1966 when Allerton voted to join with Cambria-Corydon Community Schools to form Wayne Community Schools. Lineville and Clio then formed Lineville–Clio which survived until 2010. All classes were held in Lineville. It was one of the smallest school districts in the state of Iowa. In 2010, the State of Iowa ordered Lineville–Clio closed as its small size and tax base made it impossible to meet State of Iowa educational standards. Lineville–Clio has since merged with Wayne Community Schools with all classes being held in Corydon (22 road miles away).

==Transportation==
Lineville is located on U.S. Route 65. The city is served by the Union Pacific Railroad, which was originally the CRI&amp;P (Rock Island). Rail traffic has increased considerably on this line since it was purchased by the Union Pacific. Lineville once had rail passenger service, which was discontinued in the 1960s.

==History==
The first coal mines in Seymour were opened in 1884. In 1902, the Numa Block Coal Company took over these mines. In 1908, the largest coal mine in Appanoose-Wayne Coalfield was Numa Block number 2, known as &quot;Big Jim.&quot; &quot;Big Jim&quot; was located just east of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Depot, and was able to produce 100,000 tons of coal per year at full capacity. The Mystic coal seam was just over thick here, reached by a shaft. Numa Block Mine number 3, the Sunshine Mine, was in the southeast part of town, served by the Rock Island, with a shaft to the Mystic seam.

In 1884, Local Assembly 3143 of the Knights of Labor, based in Seymour, had 40 members. In 1912, United Mine Workers Local 206 in Seymour had 299 members, approximately 13% of the entire population.

On March 6, 2017, an EF-2 tornado (confirmed by National Weather Service WFO, Des Moines, IA damage survey) hit Seymour at approximately 8:00 pm CST, damaging homes and the high school.

==Transportation==
Seymour is served by a county-maintained road which used to be Iowa Highway 55 and is now County Road S60.

Seymour is served by the CPKC Railroad, formerly Canadian Pacific Railway which currently operates the former Milwaukee Railroad tracks.

Seymour was also served by the CRI&amp;P (Rock Island) until the early 1980s. This line passed on the southwest corner of the town square with the depot in this location. This line was abandoned when the Rock Island went bankrupt. It used to be part of the Golden State Route which was a luxury passenger train operated by the Rock Island and the Southern Pacific.

The two railroad lines crossed at the western edge of Seymour and was protected by an interlocking tower until the Rock Island was abandoned.

<text>Callender is a city in Webster County, Iowa, United States. The population was 368 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
From 1866 to 1870, the Des Moines Valley Railroad Company constructed tracks between Des Moines and Fort Dodge. The other end of the line originated at Keokuk (at the confluence of the Des Moines and Mississippi rivers). As a result, several small towns were created by the railroad along the line to support track maintenance and to grow business. At intervals were 38 stops between Keokuk and Fort Dodge. Kesho, the town that would become Callender, was the 36th stop.

According to the County Assessor&#x27;s records, the town of Kesho began south of the road (Thomas Street) on the east side of the railroad tracks. There, Gurmond and Thora Bean had established a store in 1867–68. The store was operational when the Des Moines Valley Railroad made it to Kesho in December 1869; however, a November 24, 1870 newspaper article from the &quot;Iowa Northwest Newspaper&quot; reads, “The city has disappeared from the face of the earth—not like Pompeii—but it has gone off on wheels. First the horse barn fell down, then the hotel was taken to pieces and moved off, and lately the depot has been hoisted on wheels, moved up the road and landed near the Sioux City Junction (Tara). Kesho is now inhabited by muskrats alone.” A new depot replaced the old one that existed, until it was demolished in 1972. Post office records indicate that there was a post office in Kesho from 1873 until 1877.

In 1875, the town was renamed Callender in honor of Agnes and James Callender of Brooklyn Heights, New York City, New York who owned all of the land on the west side of the railroad tracks and much of the surrounding area—Webster&#x27;s Prairies. The Callenders donated land to the town for churches, the school, City Hall and the City Park. A second depot was built on the west side of the track, north of Main (Thomas) Street. The existing town retains much of the 1875 town form, including the donated properties.

==Geography==
Callender is located at (42.362592, -94.293268).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

It also features a reconstructed village from the same time period. Additionally, The Fort Museum has a replica of the Cardiff Giant, an archaeological hoax sculpted from gypsum mined at Fort Dodge. A &quot;Frontier Days&quot; event is held annually on the Fort Museum grounds. It features a parade, beauty pageant, historical reenactments, a buckskinner camp, and live entertainment. 2014 marked the 40th year of the event. Not all portrayals of early history at the Fort Museum are historically accurate and the facility is intended to be more of a tourist attraction as opposed to an actual museum.

The Blanden Memorial Art Museum, the first public museum of art in the state of Iowa, is located in the historic Oak Hill district of Fort Dodge. The Blanden opened June 5, 1932. The permanent collection on display includes European and American artists prints, sculptures and paintings. The museum also offers art classes for children and adults.

===Theater===
Theater and musical theater are historically popular arts activities in Fort Dodge, with the community maintaining three independent theater organizations. Hawkeye Community Theatre puts on six full-length productions a year of varied genre. Comedia Musica Players is a civic musical theater troupe that produces an annual musical each fall. Stage Door Productions provides theater training and performance opportunities for middle school, high school, and college-aged students during the summer. It produces one small-cast (10 or fewer) play per year.

<doc id="114337" wikidata="Q1930484" url="?curid=114337" title="Lehigh, Iowa">
<text>Lehigh is a city in Webster County, Iowa, United States. The population was 395 at the time of the 2020 census.

Located in a valley, Lehigh is divided in two by the Des Moines River, unusual for such a small town. Originally the two halves of Lehigh were two separate towns. While the town on the west side of the River was always called Lehigh, the east town was called Slabtown, and a piece of history marks the east side&#x27;s roots––a sign that hangs over the playground with the words &quot;Slabtown Traders,&quot; perhaps alluding to the flea market which is held there every summer during Lehigh River Days. The &quot;Slabtown Traders&quot; sign was blown over by a gust of wind in the summer of 2010. It survived several floods while being located on River Street. Lehigh was surrounded by coal mines until the early 20th century and home to a large clay sewer pipe factory until the 1980s. Dolliver State Park, Brushy Creek State Recreation Area and Woodman Hollow State Preserve are located within a few miles of the town.

==History==
Lehigh&#x27;s first settlers, a Mr. Reed and Mr. Wright, set up a steam sawmill on the site in 1855. Originally, the town was named &quot;Slabtown&quot; because slabs, scrap from the mill, were used in construction. By 1870, there was a Methodist church and a school, and Oliver Tyson had purchased the mill and expanded it, adding a flour mill. Soon after this, Tyson opened a store. The town was later renamed Lehigh, comparing the local coal veins to those of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Lehigh Valley.
In 1871, W. C. Wilson of Webster City opened a coal mine in Lehigh and formed the Crooked Creek Railroad and Coal Company. The company built a 3-foot gauge rail line from Judd, on the Illinois Central Railroad 8.5 miles south to the mines, including a 370-foot wooden truss bridge across the Des Moines River. The line was later extended to Webster City. By 1894, the company had opened 5 mines, all using longwall mining. The Webster Coal and Land Company operated a mine near Lehigh from 1899 to 1902.

In 1878, Lehigh shipped 5,640 tons of coal. In 1883, 6,887 tons were shipped, in 1884, 9,000 tons. Membership in the United Mine Workers union is a useful measure of the importance of mining. In 1912, Lehigh was home to UMW Local 855 with 64 members (about 6.9% of the 1910 population).

The Crooked Creek railroad was widened to standard gauge in 1880 and a line to Webster City was built in 1886. In 1916, the line was incorporated into the Fort Dodge, Des Moines and Southern Railroad, Iowa&#x27;s longest Interurban line. Diesel traction replaced overhead electric lines in the 1950s and the track was abandoned in 1962.

By 1901, Lehigh was large enough to support a new First National Bank, with an initial capitalization of $25,000. The bank must have been small; in 1910, O. J. Woodward arrived in town to become the cashier, manager and director of the bank.
In addition to coal mines, Lehigh was home to several other industries. The most prominent were brickyards that used the shale of the coal measures as a source of clay to make both brick and drain tile, firing their kilns with local coal. One of these, the Lehigh Brick and Tile company, won the contract to provide paving brick for Dubuque, Iowa in 1896, but suffered a serious fire in late 1897.

In 1901, there were 2 large brickworks in Lehigh, the Corey Pressed Brick Company and the Lehigh Clay Works, which began operation in 1900. In addition, the old Lehigh Brick and Tile works was being rebuilt after the fire. Corey was mining clay from both above and below the coal seam. By 1903, Lehigh Brick and Tile was back in production, the Lehigh and the Campbell brickyard of the Webster city Brick and Tile Company. The Cory plant was primarily a brickworks, while the others primarily produced drainage tile.

==Geography==
Lehigh is located at (42.357332, −94.051283) on the west bank of the Des Moines River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

<text>Buffalo Center is a city in Winnebago County, Iowa, United States. The population was 857 at the time of the 2020 census. Its ZIP code is 50424.

==History==
Buffalo Center was platted in 1892, and was incorporated as a city later that same year. In 1996, Buffalo Center officially became the host community of the newly-formed North Iowa Community School.[4]

Located seven miles south of the Minnesota border, the town was named Buffalo Center because it was midway between the north and south forks of Buffalo Creek. The town was originally built south of the present site and moved north when the Chicago and Iowa Western Railroad set up lines in northern Iowa. It was settled in 1892 on mostly swampy ground, later dredged and tiled. One of the original settlers, Howard Pomeroy, took a mower and mowed through his wheat fields to show where the streets would be, and a hardware store and a blacksmith shop were the first business enterprises in the new town.

Buffalo Center has survived a number of devastating fires, which have ravaged Main Street businesses over and over, and the occasional tornado, as well as several winter storms and blizzards. One of the most severe was the historic Armistice Day blizzard of November 11, 1940, which killed 154 people throughout Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan.

On August 23, 1897, Buffalo Center became the first school system west of the Mississippi River to be consolidated, and it is believed to be the second one in the nation.

Today, Buffalo Center is a thriving town of about 1000 people. We have a large new community center, our first museum, several new businesses and a K-12 consolidated school that educates students from Buffalo Center, Rake, Lakota and Thompson.

Our 4 July celebration is a well-known all-day holiday which features a 5K, a parade, music in the park, tournaments, games and contests for the kids, and a huge fireworks display. Other annual events include the Winter Gala, Crazy Days, the Firemen&#x27;s Dance in July, and the Old-Fashioned Christmas Celebration in December. In 2022, the town had its first ‘Bison Days’ in the end of July. This celebration includes fireworks, a parade, park games, free food, vendors, concert and the famous firemen’s dance and many more activities. The July 4th celebration activities were moved to the last weekend in July for Bison Days.

Buffalo Center has a volunteer fire department along with a volunteer ambulance service.

An independent school district coinciding with the Buffalo township was established after a vote on December 13, 1895. It was renamed in 1897 to the Buffalo Center Consolidated School District. The Buffalo Center Community School District was formed on July 1, 1954, by the merger of five one-room schoolhouse districts, with the establishment of a centralized school approved by the board in August of that year. The Buffalo Center district merged with the Rake Community School District to form the Buffalo Center–Rake district on July 1, 1978. On July 1, 1992, Buffalo Center-Rake merged with the Lakota Consolidated School District to form the Buffalo Center–Rake–Lakota district, and that district merged with Thompson to form North Iowa in 1996. In March 2024 North Iowa declared to switch do a 4 day school week proposed by superintendent Joe Erickson.

Buffalo Center has a high school, North Iowa Community School, located in the town. It was the first consolidated school west of the Mississippi River. North Iowa Community School consists of students from Buffalo Center, as well as the three surrounding, smaller communities of Lakota, located to the west; Rake, to the north; and Thompson, to the east. The school&#x27;s mascot is the Bison, which had been Buffalo Center&#x27;s mascot for many years. At the time of Buffalo Center&#x27;s merger with Rake in 1978, the Bison had been members of the eight-team North Iowa Conference since the league was founded in 1929. Meanwhile, the Rake High School Tigers, Lakota Eagles, and Thompson Cubs had all belonged to the 11-member State Line Conference. Thompson had been one of the six founding members, along with Ledyard, Swea City, Ringsted, Armstrong, and Burt. Lakota had joined the State Line Conference in 1942, and Rake in 1958. Rake had been the only member of the Conference to not have girls&#x27; basketball.

In 2015, North Iowa High School became one of the nine founding members of the Top of Iowa Conference - West.

<text>Thompson is a city in Winnebago County, Iowa, United States. The population was 495 at the time of the 2020 census.

Thompson is home to the Winnebago County Fair, held annually, various agricultural businesses, a public outdoor swimming pool, the Thompson Museum, and Bethany Lutheran Church, built in 1902.

==History==
Thompson was platted in 1892. It was incorporated as a city in 1894.

A post office opened in 1890, and rural carrier service was established in 1904.

The Thompson Courier began publication in 1894, and is still in business. In 1938, the paper expanded operations with the purchase of the Rake Register, becoming the Thompson Courier and Rake Register.

Thompson&#x27;s first telephone switchboard was installed in the home of Dr. G.M. Lee in 1894. Groups of farmers joined together to establish their own small phone companies, and 12 systems shared the town&#x27;s joint switchboard and party lines. By the 1940s, the Switchboard Company had purchased its own building, and the Thompson Telephone Company and Thompson Telephone Cooperative were formed. In 1951, the local Rural Electrification Association released a movie featuring several Thompson residents, who described the struggles for adequate phone service in Winnebago County, until a federal Rural Electrification Administration telephone loan finally enabled the Winnebago Cooperative Telephone Association to provide modern dial service.

The Thompson Cooperative Creamery was chartered in 1897. The creamery consolidated the earlier milk station operations at Amund corner, Vinje, and three other locations, which used large volume separators to skim off cream. Cooling and churning were powered by a steam boiler until electricity was installed.

The Farmers Cooperative Elevator Company formed in 1907, as farmers were dissatisfied with the prices received at the three independent grain elevators.

The Thompson Fire Department built its fire hall in 1925.

Thompson was without a bank for over a year after the First National Bank shut its doors on June 26, 1932, and the State Bank of Thompson and First National Bank of Thompson failed. The Peoples State Bank opened in Thompson on August 1, 1933.

The Thompson Public Library was established in 1937-1938, as a civic improvement project by the Thompson Study Club. The library was located in the Town Hall for 45 years. The library moved into a remodeled section of the fire station in 1983.

In 1938, the Winnebago Rural Electric Cooperative was established. The first section of lines was energized on January 3, 1940.

A large cement grain elevator was built in 1950, and an even larger cement elevator in 1967.

The landmark Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot on Main Street burned to the ground on February 26, 1963. The railroad brought in a small structure which served as its replacement until the line shut down in 1980.

On October 30, 1974, Peoples State Bank was robbed by three unmasked men. An abandoned getaway car was found on a gravel road about six miles from town, but the robbers were never apprehended.

One of the worst fires in Thompson&#x27;s history occurred on December 22, 1980, and destroyed about half of the Main Street business block, including the Branding Iron Supper Club, which moved into a new building.

In 1983, one of the cement grain elevators ruptured, and was demolished.

During the 2020 Covid pandemic, 79 Thompson area businesses received CARES Act Paycheck Protection Program loans.

<text>Decorah is the largest city in and county seat of Winneshiek County, Iowa, United States. The population was 7,587 at the time of the 2020 census. Decorah is located at the intersection of State Highway 9 and U.S. Route 52. Located within the Driftless Area in northeastern Iowa, Decorah is situated in the bluffs of the Upper Iowa River, which flows through the city. Decorah is a college town, being the home of Luther College. It is known for its Norwegian-American heritage and the corresponding Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum. 

==History==
Decorah was the site of a Ho-Chunk village beginning &quot;circa&quot; 1840. Several Ho-Chunks had settled along the Upper Iowa River that year when the U.S. Army forced them to remove from Wisconsin. In 1848, the United States removed the Ho-Chunks again to a new reservation in Minnesota, opening their Iowa villages to white settlers.

The first European-Americans to settle were the Day family from Tazewell County, Virginia. According to local Congregationalist minister Rev. Ephraim Adams, the Days arrived in June 1849 with the Ho-Chunks&#x27; &quot;tents still standing—with the graves of the dead scattered about where now run our streets and stand our dwellings.&quot; Judge Eliphalet Price suggested that the Days name their new settlement &quot;Decorah&quot; after Ho-Chunk leader Waukon Decorah, who was a U.S. ally during the Black Hawk War of 1832.

During the 1850s and 1860s, Decorah grew quickly as settlers built dams and mills to harness water power at Dunning&#x27;s Spring and other local streams. In 1851, the town became the county seat of Winneshiek County. Decorah also became the site of a United States General Land Office from 1855 to 1856, making it a destination for immigrants seeking land patents in northern Iowa.

Since 1861, it has been the home of Luther College, a liberal arts institution affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.

The Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad opened a branch to Decorah in 1869.
Decorah has become a center for Norwegian-American culture originating from a high number of Norwegian settlements beginning in the 1850s. Each July, Decorah is the host of Nordic Fest, a celebration of Norwegian culture with ethnic dancing, food, and music. Decorah is also the home of the Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum, the largest museum in the country devoted to a single immigrant group. Until 1972, one of the largest Norwegian language newspapers in the nation was published in Decorah, the &quot;Decorah Posten&quot;.

==Geography==
Decorah is located approximately south of the Minnesota-Iowa border. It is the northernmost major community located along U.S. Route 52 in Iowa. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Decorah is located in and on the bluffs of the Upper Iowa River valley; the river flows through the city en route to its confluence with the Upper Mississippi River. The river is faced by steep bluffs, characteristic of the Driftless Area.
===Impact crater===

About 470 million years ago, a meteorite as big as a city block smashed into what is now Decorah, supporting a theory that a giant space rock broke up and bombarded Earth just as early life began flourishing in the oceans.

The impact dug a crater nearly four miles wide that now lies beneath the town, said Bevan French, one of the world&#x27;s foremost crater hunters and an adjunct scientist at the National Museum of Natural History.

The Decorah crater lay undiscovered until recently because almost none of it is above ground. Instead, it is filled by an unusual shale that formed after an ancient seaway sluiced into the crater, depositing sediment and an array of bizarre sea creatures that hardened into fossils. One such creature is &quot;Pentecopterus decorahensis&quot;, which was named for the city.

The convent, which had a second-floor bridge to the original school building, was renovated to be the second school building. In 1964 the current school was built for $268,000 in southern Decorah. A new addition was established in the 1980s, with a music room, a storage and teaching aid area, and two classrooms.

In 1956, power became available on a wholesale basis from the Bureau of Reclamation (and generated at the dams on the Missouri River in South Dakota). The REC receives its power from five substations, and by 1987, it had approximately of line in operation, serving 2,598 locations. The cooperative is strictly nonprofit and all revenue above the cost of delivering power to members is pro-rated back to these members on the basis of their business done with the cooperative.

It includes three sets of tee boxes for an enjoyable but challenging (somewhat hilly) golf experience on about . Designed by Martin Johnson, the bluegrass course was built in 1967–68 on land donated by Charlie and Helen Logan of Moville; its clubhouse is a former two-story barn (60 ft X 100 ft) built in 1917 for the purpose of breeding, raising and showing draft horses raised by Helen Logan&#x27;s father: W.W.

==Parks and recreation==
Moville is home to three parks within city limits and one just north of town.
* Moville City Park- 400 Main Street (built in 1916). The park includes a Pavilion that seats 200 and full kitchen, newly renovated Tennis and Basketball courts, newly-renovated playground equipment, and sand volleyball court.
* Memorial Park (built in 1942) includes a shelterhouse and a children&#x27;s play area in its shady location just up the hill east from the town&#x27;s swimming pool. Following WW2, the American Legion set and dedicated the memorial boulder in recognition of the town&#x27;s servicemen and women. The Moville Woman&#x27;s Club along with the City recently renovated the shelter house to include an indoor and outdoor seating area, and Eagle Scout Ryan Fouts led a project to replace the playground equipment. In 2021, the Woodbury Central ‘Class of 1970’ added a Sensory Area Playground in memory of classmate Chuck Logan.
* Veterans Park (built 2005) is a block south of Main Street and its landmark flagpole. It was presented to the City by Dr. EE &amp; Helen (Logan) Maxwell.
* Ridge Park (north end of Park Ridge Place) includes new children&#x27;s play area and seating.
* Midway Park (built 1955) is the site of an abandoned state gravel pit situated about midway between the towns of Moville, Kingsley, Iowa and Pierson, Iowa. The north pit was once safe for swimming, so a sandy beach was formed, lifeguards were put on duty, a bath-house was constructed and trees were planted. The south side of the gravel pit was for fishing, boating and picnicking. In the early 1980s, the park was turned over to the direction of the Woodbury County Board of Supervisors; it is no longer a swimming area but is used for ice fishing, and summer picnics and fishing.
* Jack Haskell Swimming Pool
* Ann Walker Basketball Courts

==Arts and culture==
* Woodbury County Library dates back to 1929 when it was organized by the Moville Woman&#x27;s Club and called the Moville Public Library. By 1943, the library was developing so rapidly that its board of directors asked the Moville Town Council to assume full responsibility for it. On Nov. 3, 1948, the Woodbury County Library was voted into existence, and established its headquarters in Moville in August 1950. In 1954, it merged with the Woodbury County Library and added its book collection of approximately 4,000 volumes, many of which came from the personal libraries of members of the Moville Woman&#x27;s Club as well as other local citizens. Once merged with the county library system, the circulation of the Woodbury County Library during its first year was 22,422. By 1961, it had increased to a circulation of more than 125,000 (30,000 volumes) in its county-wide system. By 1987, the library included more than 60,000 volumes and 1,000 film strips, with a circulation of more than 90,000 among the 12,000 residents it served. Board members include a person from each of the following towns in Woodbury County: Lawton, Moville, Hornick, Danbury, Anthon, Bronson and Pierson. In July 2006, the library moved from its former location amongst downtown Moville into the newly built Moville Community Center, located on land donated by Robert L. and Carol Logan of Moville.

<text>Pierson is a city in Woodbury County, Iowa, United States. It is part of the Sioux City, Iowa–Nebraska–South Dakota Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 337 at the time of the 2020 census. Pierson was platted in 1883 with railroads and lumberyards being important to its growth. The city started with only eight blocks of land until new additions were later made. Pierson has a library, a school district, and five churches, among other businesses and recreation.

==History==
Pierson was platted in 1883 and the original owners were the Railroad Land Co. The city might have been named for Moses Pearson a pioneer settler. Pierson originally only had eight blocks of land and new additions began being added in July 1892. Railroads were important to the growth of northwest Iowa, which includes Pierson, due to it carrying lumber and other material for expansion. Lumberyards were a major business in the early days of Pierson with the earliest such company being founded in 1883 as the Joyce Lumber Company. The newspaper &quot;Pierson Press&quot; was published from 1882, a year before being platted, until 1957. John C. Pierson was the mayor from 1898 to 1905.

Henry Castle from Correctionville, Iowa, founded a store in Pierson that sold groceries and hardware and acted as a post office. In 1885, the store was purchased by Mills and Robinson from Sioux City, Iowa, until 1890, when J. C. Mills purchased it, and he operated it until he died in 1903.

The Pierson Public Library had its beginnings in 1902 when 26 members formed a &quot;Literary and Reading Club.&quot; Their reading room was in a store&#x27;s basement until the group lost interest. A library association was started in December 1912, and the library was located inside the town hall. The Iowa State Traveling Library gave books to the library during that time. In February 1935, a library was started by The Pierson Federated Women&#x27;s Club. In 1951, a county library was organized, and the women&#x27;s club gave their Pierson library to Woodbury County. The library moved a few more times until its current location on Main Street within the city hall.

Pierson has an ambulance. Organizations within Pierson are the Pierson Library Friends, 4-H, Rutland Masonic Lodge, Federated Women&#x27;s Club, Legion, Legion Auxiliary, Junior Girls Auxiliary, and the Golf Club Association. Pierson&#x27;s only cemetery is Greenwood Cemetery. It was founded in 1904, although a few burials happened in the area in 1903. It is located a mile away from Pierson on D31 or Minnesota Avenue.

==Recreation==
Pierson&#x27;s city park contains an area that has plants and flowers that are native to the area. It was formed through Pierson&#x27;s Source Water Protection Plan.

Jenni Battern Memorial Park has a basketball court and a playground. Pierson&#x27;s three churches are the United Methodist Church, Salem Lutheran Church, and Pierson Christian Church.

The Old School Bell Memorial is in front of the middle school, and it has a bell taken from the 1893 school and bricks taken from the 1915 school. The Veterans War Memorial was made in 1921 to honor World War I veterans and another memorial was built in 2004 to honor veterans who served in later wars.

In August 2021, the arts and music festival Golphstok 2021 was held in Pierson. The festival was started in the summer of 2017 as a way for the founder to play music with his two sons. The first GolfStock was organized as a way to raise funds for Pierson&#x27;s golf course, but the potential was realized for GolphStok to really grow into an annual tradition for Pierson. Golphstock was originally named Golfstock as a play on words of Woodstock, but the name changed when it was not for a golf course fundraiser.

The original 1914 brick classrooms were demolished in 1977. The 1949 gymnasium structure has been renovated over the years to become the Rowan Events Center. Owned by the City of Rowan, the gymnasium is now used as the Iowa River Players Community Theatre.

<text>Humboldt is a city in Allen County, Kansas, United States. It is situated along the Neosho River. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 1,847.

==History==
===19th century===
Humboldt, originally an American settlement named after Baron von Humboldt, was founded in 1857. Germans migrating from Hartford, Connecticut, began organizing a colony during the winter of 1856–57. They arrived in Lawrence, Kansas, in March 1857, and at the townsite on May 10, 1857. Orlin Thurston, a young attorney, moved to Humboldt during the summer of 1857 and put up a steam sawmill; he began sawing wood and building houses on the prairie side of town. The first frame building was erected by J.A. Coffey; and in May 1858, W.C. O&#x27;Brien opened the first gristmill in the county. The United Brethren Denomination erected the first church in 1859.

In 1861 Humboldt was attacked by a collection of border ruffians and Osages led by John Allen Mathews out of Oswego, Kansas who took several recently freed African-Americans back into captivity. The Humboldt Home Guard joined with the Kansas 6th Cavalry under James G. Blunt to counter-attack. In a battle on September. 18, 1861 Mathews was killed at Chetopa, Kansas.

The city was organized as a village in 1866 and incorporated as a city of the second class by the act of February 28, 1870. In October 1870 the Leavenworth, Lawrence &amp; Galveston railway was run through Humboldt; the railway was operated during the 20th century as part of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and is currently operated by the South Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad.

Humboldt was the Allen county seat for seven years, from 1858 until 1865, when Iola became the seat. Humboldt won two contentious legislative elections to become the seat in 1858 and 1860, but another election in 1865 at the end of the American Civil War resulted in the re-location of the county seat to Iola. The legitimacy of this election was questioned by Humboldt residents due to low turnout arising from soldiers fighting the War. Some residents claim that the county seat was &quot;stolen&quot;. Iola effectively secured the seat by donating 100 lots to the county to aid in the construction of public buildings and subsequently raising funds to build a courthouse. However, Humboldt was also guilty of shady practices. Lieut. Col. Charles W. Blair, the commander of Fort Scott, temporarily replaced the commander of the post at Humboldt, Maj. Henry C. Haas, to keep the soldiers there from illegally voting in the county seat election. Blair claimed none of the troops were legal voters in Humboldt. The Humboldt newspaper, however, denied the troops had been involved in any wrongdoing. County seat wars of this sort were common in Kansas and the American West.

===Civil War fortifications===
Humboldt was very much involved in the American Civil War. The town was raided September 1, 1861, by Confederate raiders, who took much property and kidnapped eight free blacks, who may have been placed into slavery. Several persons may have been wounded by gunfire, but no one was killed. Many of the raiders were hunted down and one of the leaders, Col. John Allen Mathews, was killed.

Actions were taken to prevent Humboldt coming under further attack. Two home guard companies were organized in the Humboldt area. These militia units sought to protect the town and to scout as far south as the Kansas-Indian Territory border to prevent Confederates from coming too close to town. Some of the militia were involved with the pursuit of the September raiders. Two Humboldt area structures, O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Mill and W. W. Curdy dry goods store, were fortified.

Humboldt fell victim to another raid on October 14, 1861, months after the first raid. The second raid caught the town totally off guard and the 100 home guards surrendered when they discovered they could not protect the town from the 330 raiders. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Mill and most of the town was burned. The W. W. Curdy store apparently was spared, but it played no further role in Humboldt&#x27;s defenses. It was said the second raid was at least in part revenge for the killing of Mathews and for the actions of U.S. Senator James H. Lane and his brigade&#x27;s sacking and destruction of Osceola, Missouri.

After the second raid the threats to Humboldt&#x27;s safety were taken very seriously. At times the town had local militia units operating and most of the rest of the Civil War the town had Army troops stationed there. Sometimes the military post there was called Post Humboldt. A blockhouse was partially constructed at 514 S. 3rd Street. This was used by the local militia as its headquarters and as a recruiting office.

Other points in town were used by the military. The German settlers in town built a church on Bridge Street, in the east part of town. This was used as the post&#x27;s quartermaster store and was run by a sergeant. On the west side of town, a number of cabins were built on the east side of the Neosho River. This was sometimes called Log Town, but was more commonly known as Camp Hunter. When the ranks swelled beyond the capacity of the cabins, tents were pitched at the camp. Of the places used by the military, home guards and militia, today only the German church stands and it was converted into a private residence in the 1950s. The geographic coordinates of the various points are:
* O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Mill (approx. location) – 
* Camp Hunter – 
* German church – 
* W. W. Curdy dry goods store (approx. location) – 
* Blockhouse – 

In October 1864, the area was threatened by a huge raid through Missouri and eastern Kansas. The Confederate raiders were commanded by Maj. Gen. Sterling Price and most of the troops and militia went to meet the threat further east. Also, in the same time period Maj. Haas, in command of the troops, and Maj. Watson Stewart, in command of the militia had differences of opinion as to the extent of the jurisdiction of Haas. Haas wanted control of the militia and Stewart contested this. The militia maintained its independence, but not until Haas managed to arrest one of the militia&#x27;s officers.

The post at Humboldt was manned by troops at least through June 1865. It probably lasted into July and very possibly into August. When troops abandoned the town, the use of the military buildings came to an end, as well.

<text>Iola () is the county seat of Allen County, Kansas, United States. The city is situated along the Neosho River in southeast Kansas. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 5,396. It is named in honor of Iola Colborn, the wife of Josiah Colborn, one of the town&#x27;s founders.

==History==

The history of Iola began in 1859. After the location of the county seat at Humboldt, by the legislature of 1858, there was a great deal of dissatisfaction among the residents of the central and northern parts of the county, and a number of citizens selected the present site of Iola, with the intention of ultimately securing the county seat. On January 1, 1859, a large meeting was held at the Deer Creek schoolhouse. It was determined to organize a town company, which was immediately done, and a constitution was then adopted and officers elected. The officers of the company after due consideration of different points selected a site for the proposed town, about two miles (3 km) north of Cofachique, at the confluence of Elm Creek and the Neosho River. The site was owned in part by J.F. Colborn and W.H. Cochrane. The claims on two quarter-sections were bought, and were soon after surveyed into lots.

The town company worked to get the town started. A meeting was held to choose a name. Several were proposed, and the choice was determined by ballot. Some one had proposed the name Iola, which was the Christian name of J.F. Colborn&#x27;s wife. As a result of the vote, this name was chosen. Meetings of the company were held every week during the first year and efforts made to induce settlement. By the close of the year a number of lots had been disposed of, several buildings erected, and other improvements made, as all who bought lots were required to make some improvements at once. The residents of Cofachique, despairing of making their town a success, joined with Iola, and most of them moved to the new site, all working together in the endeavor to secure the location of the county seat at once.

The first building on the town site was a small log cabin owned by D.B. Bayne. Late in 1859, he built a frame house addition to it. The first building erected after the town was surveyed was a dwelling completed early in June, 1859, by J.F. Colborn, who had lived on the claim of which the town site formed a part, since 1857. On the completion of the house, Colborn and his family moved into it, thus being the first settlers in the town of Iola. The first birth in Iola was that of Luella E. Colborn.

About 1859 a stone building was built to become the town&#x27;s headquarters in the event of troubles with Indians or Bushwhackers. When the Civil War erupted in 1861, the building and the block on which it stood were fortified, becoming Iola&#x27;s fort. The fort served both the local militia and Army troops throughout the War.

During 1859, two stores were established by Aaron Case and James Faulkner, who had moved their buildings and goods from the old town of Cofachique, and the first hotel was opened. The post office for the neighborhood had previously been at Cofachique, and Aaron Case was Postmaster, but in October 1859, the office was removed to Iola, Case still being Postmaster, though James Faulkner attended to it, as his deputy, until he was appointed to the office a short time after. In 1860, a number of buildings were erected, and the population increased to about 150. Two more stores were opened—a dry goods store, by D.B. Bayne, and a grocery, by J.M. Cowan.

On March 26, 1860, an election was held on the re-location of the county seat, but the majority of votes were cast to keep the county seat in Humboldt. People were still dissatisfied, and for several years thereafter the county seat question entered largely into every political campaign. Much strife and bitterness of feeling was thus engendered between the two sections of the county, and harsh accusations and recriminations were the order of the day. After a number of years of strife, an election was again ordered, to take place on May 19, 1865. Having secured a majority of the votes, Iola was declared the county seat, and the records and county offices removed there at once, since which time it has remained.

City improvements in 1860 were nearly all made in the spring and early summer. In the latter part of the year the effects of the drought were so badly felt, in addition to failing to secure the county seat, that business became very dull, and for a time all of the citizens were much discouraged. In 1861 the war broke out, and as nearly every able-bodied man in Iola, as well as the county, had entered the army there was no chance for improvement; and until the close of the war, in 1865, the town grew to be no larger than it was in 1860. In 1865, after the return of the citizens from the army at the close of the war, the town began to improve steadily, and so continued until the year 1870, at which time (in March) it was incorporated as a city of the third class (bounded by State Street on the west, Irwin Street on the south, Cottonwood Street on the east, and Brooks Street (now Carpenter Street) on the north), and having secured the Leavenworth, Lawrence and Galveston Railroad, rapid strides were made for the next two years in the improvement of the town. Several manufacturing establishments were in project, and some of them were built.

Among other heavy institutions at that time, was the King Bridge Manufacturing Company, which located the Bridge shops at Iola, in 1871. For some time large numbers of men were employed, and good business was done. But with the monetary panic of 1873, the value of bonds so depreciated that the company failed, and removed its machinery. They received bonds in payment, generally, for their bridges and work, and for this reason the &quot;crash&quot; ruined them. The buildings and several acres of land on which they were located were sold at a Sheriff&#x27;s sale for $1,100, being purchased by several citizens of Iola. The early journal of the city disappeared during the trouble with the King Iron Bridge Company, relative to the payment of the city bonds voted to that company, which caused some trouble regarding the legality of some of the ordinances and acts said to have been enacted by the first City Council. During the period 1873 to 1876, business in all branches was very poor, and little improvement in the town was made.

The &quot;Allen County Courant&quot; was the first newspaper published int Iola, and was established January 5, 1867, by W.H. Johnson. On July 27, 1868, Messrs. Talcott &amp; Acers purchased it, and the name of the paper was changed to the &quot;Neosho Valley Register&quot;. In the following years the ownership of the paper changed five times and it was briefly renamed &quot;Kansas State Register&quot; between August 24 and December 10, 1870. On January 1, 1875, W.G. Allison &amp; H.W. Perkins took charge and changed the paper&#x27;s name to the &quot;Iola Register&quot;. The paper remained Republican under each of these different names and proprietorships.

When the county seat was located at Iola, the town company donated 100 lots to the county, to aid in the construction of public buildings. In July, 1866, bonds were voted to help raise the necessary funds, and not long after a building was purchased from George J. Eldridge, and used for county offices and all court house purposes. In 1877, a new court house, built of stone, was purchased for $1,800, and the old one was sold to the school district to use for a schoolhouse, for $500. The school was kept in two buildings, one the large two-story stone structure erected in 1868, and having an imposing appearance with its twin towers. The other building was a two-story frame, and situated just south of the stone schoolhouse.

The Allen County Jail, a strong stone structure, was built at a cost of $10,000, in county bonds, which were voted in August, 1868. The next year, the building was erected by White &amp; Hays, at a contract price of $8,400.

In November, 1871, a tax of $5,000 was voted, to purchase and fit up a poor-farm. On February 12, 1872, a tract of land comprising was purchased of David Funkhouser, for $26 per acre, and J. W. Driscoll was appointed keeper of the poor-farm.

An economic boom from natural gas (discovered December 25, 1893) began around 1895 and resulted in a surge in population and industry. In 1910, the population had reached 9,032.

==Geography==

Iola is situated along the eastern bank of the Neosho River between Deer Creek, to the north, and Rock Creek, to the south, with Coon Creek flowing through the city. Important natural gas fields are in the vicinity. U.S. Route 54 passes through Iola along Madison Street and interchanges with U.S. Route 169, which passes by the east side of the city. The smaller cities of Gas and La Harpe are a few miles to the east along US-54. The tiny city of Bassett lies adjacent to Iola&#x27;s southern border, and the city of Humboldt is approximately to the south along US-169.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Iola has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Culture==
Iola hosts its annual Farm City Days in mid-October. It&#x27;s a celebration which involves a parade, and carnival. The origins of this event go back to 1971 when Stanley Dreher, Gary Parker, and Leon Catron began an effort to bring townspeople out to the farm. The purpose of the event is to show appreciation to its farm-town qualities. Aaron Franklin and his crew now work very hard to make sure that Farm-City Days still has the magic for all townspeople that has existed in this celebration for nearly 50 years.

<text>Greeley is a city in Anderson County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 273.

==History==
===Early history===
Nomadic Native Americans, perhaps the Wichita as early as the 1400s and the Osage by the 1700s, would have been present in the area for many centuries. The Trail of Death relocated the Potawatomie to the area in 1838, and they had established subsistence farming at what would become Greeley prior to the arrival of European-Americans.

The first European-American settlement at Greeley was made in May 1854 by Valentine Gerth and Francis Myer. Though the town of Greeley had not yet been established, Myer&#x27;s cabin served as Anderson County&#x27;s temporary county seat from August 1855 through the county&#x27;s first Territorial District Court session in April 1856. At that time the county seat moved to its first &quot;permanent&quot; location at what would become the town of Shannon.

Greeley was laid out in December 1856 by several Free Staters and named for Horace Greeley. Likely unique among American frontier towns, the three officers of the original Greeley Town Company were all Ashkenazi Jews: August Bondi, Jacob Benjamin, and Theodore Wiener (sometimes misspelled Weiner, or even Weimar in later texts).

The post office was established in May 1857, though not without some controversy. Postal officials in the Buchanan Administration apparently objected to naming the office after an abolitionist newspaperman, so instead used the name of Buchannan-appointed Territorial Governor Robert J. Walker. The office was called Walker until it relocated to the competing town of Mount Gilead, Kansas in May 1861. The postal name Greeley was not used until April 1866 when the Mount Gilead townsite failed and the post office returned to its original location.

The St. Louis, Kansas and Arizona Railway (a division of the Missouri Pacific) reached Greeley in 1879, and today operates as part of the Union Pacific Railroad.

Greeley was incorporated as a city in 1881.

===20th century===
In 1901 Arizona cattle baron Colin Cameron established his midwestern operations just east of Greeley. Cameron&#x27;s Fields of Lochiel ranch served as the finishing operation for his San Rafael Ranch Herefords prior to sale in Kansas City, Missouri.

* Kaiser Avenue - Named for Charles Kaiser, a Bavarian immigrant who was seriously wounded in the Battle of Osawatomie, taken prisoner, and assassinated by his Border Ruffian captors near Olathe, Kansas.
* Brown Avenue - Greeley&#x27;s primary commercial street, named for John Brown.

<text>Atchison is a city in, and the county seat of, Atchison County, Kansas, United States, along the Missouri River. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 10,885. The city is named in honor of US Senator David Rice Atchison from Missouri and was the original eastern terminus of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. Atchison is also the home of Benedictine College.

==History==

===Founding===

Atchison was founded in 1854 and named in honor of Missouri senator David Rice Atchison, who, when Kansas was opened for settlement, interested some of his friends in the scheme of forming a city in the new territory. Senator Atchison was interested in ensuring that the population of the new Kansas Territory would be majority pro-slavery, as he had been a prominent promoter of both slavery and the idea of popular sovereignty over the issue in the new lands. However, not everyone agreed upon the location he had selected, and on July 20, 1854, Dr. John H. Stringfellow, Ira Norris, Leonidas Oldham, James B. Martin, and Neal Owens left Platte City, Missouri, to decide definitely upon a site. They found a site that was the natural outlet of a remarkably rich agricultural region just open to settlement. George M. Million and Samuel Dickson had staked claims near the river; Dr. Stringfellow staked a tract north of Million&#x27;s. Million sold his claim for $1,000—an exorbitant price. Eighteen persons were present when the town company was formally organized by electing Peter T. Abell, president; James Burns, treasurer; and Dr. Stringfellow, secretary. The site was divided into 100 shares by the company, of which each member retained five shares, the remainder being reserved for common benefit of all. By September 20, 1854, Henry Kuhn had surveyed the and made a plat, and the next day was fixed for the sale of lots, an event of great importance as it had become understood that Senator Atchison would make a speech upon the political question of the day, hence the sale would be of political as well as business significance. At his meeting on the 21st, two public institutions of vital interest to a new community were planned for—a hotel and a newspaper. Each share of stock in the town company was assessed $25, the proceeds to be used to build the National Hotel, which was completed in the spring of 1855, and $400 was donated to Dr. Stringfellow and Robert S. Kelley to erect a printing office.

The &quot;Squatter Sovereign&quot;, a paper with strong pro-slavery sentiments, was first issued on February 3, 1855. It had formerly been published at Liberty, Missouri, under the name of the &quot;Democratic Platform&quot;. In the spring of 1857 it was purchased by Samuel C. Pomeroy, Robert McBratney and F.G. Adams, who changed its policy and published it as a free-state paper until the fall of the same year, when Pomeroy became the sole owner.

The first post office in Atchison was established April 10, 1855, with Kelley as postmaster. It was opened in a small building in the block later occupied by the Otis house. In July 1883, the free-delivery system was inaugurated.

For years there had been considerable trade up and down the Missouri River, which had naturally centered at Leavenworth, but in June 1855, several overland freighters, such as Livingston, Kinkead &amp; Co., and Hooper &amp; Williams were induced to select Atchison as their outfitting point and formed the basis that established Atchison as a commercial center. Early merchants to establish businesses in the new town were George Challis, Burns Bros., Stephen Johnston and Samuel Dickson.

On August 30, 1855, Atchison was incorporated. Dr. Stringfellow had North Atchison surveyed and platted in the fall of 1857. This started a fever of additions. In February 1858, West Atchison was laid out by John Roberts, and in May Samuel Dickson had his property surveyed as South Atchison. Still another addition was made by John Challis.

Until 1858, the city was a pro-slavery bastion, but by that year, the anti-slavery forces took control of the city. On February 12, 1858, the legislature issued a charter to the city of Atchison, which was approved by the people on March 2 at a special election. The first city officers were elected at a second special election on March 13, 1858, and Republican Samuel C. Pomeroy was elected mayor. The German element, largely Catholic, opposed the Sunday closing laws of the new city government, but a satisfactory compromise was reached that allowed the sale of beer on Sundays after church services.

===Early development===
The first schools in the town were private, including parochial schools operated by the Germans. One of the first English schools was opened in 1857 by Lizzie Bay. The first school district was established in October 1858, and a month later the Atchison free high school was opened at the corner of Atchison and Commercial streets.

===Civil War===

At the outbreak of the American Civil War there were three militia companies organized in Atchison, whose members enlisted in the Kansas regiments. They were known as Companies A, C and “At All Hazards”. Early in September 1861, a home guard was organized in the town to protect it in case of invasion from Missouri, and on the 15th of the month another company was raised, which was subsequently mustered into a state regiment. In 1863 the city of Atchison raised $4,000 to assist the soldiers from the county and after the Lawrence Massacre a like sum was subscribed to assist the stricken people of that city. Citizens of the town also joined the vigilance committees that so materially aided the civil authorities in suppressing raiding and the lawless bands of thieves that infested the border counties.

During the war, Atchison was also the headquarters of numerous bands of jayhawkers including the notorious Charles Metz, who was known as Cleveland. Metz, a former prisoner at the Missouri State Penitentiary, selected Atchison as his headquarters for raids into Missouri and was accepted with open arms by the people of the town. During his period of operations, he stole hundreds of horses from Missouri farmers and sold them in Kansas. He robbed any suspected southern sympathizer and threatened several leading citizens with murder and robbery if they remained in town. He even had the audacity to run off the first president of Atchison, P.T. Abell, who was forced into exile until after the Civil War concluded. He defied all authorities who attempted to rein in his excesses, but was finally shot and killed at some point in 1862. He is buried in St. Joseph, Missouri.

===Industrialization===
In the late 1850s, plans were underway to connect California to the rest of the country by rail. The logical location for a western terminus was in or around San Francisco, California, but an eastern terminus had yet to be chosen. Atchison was in fierce competition to be selected as the terminus, and in order to bolster its position, a rail line was constructed from St. Joseph, Missouri to Atchison between 1857 and 1859, funded in large part by $150,000 raised by the citizens of Atchison and connected to the Hannibal &amp; St. Joseph R.R. at its eastern end. The Atchison and Topeka Railroad was founded in 1859 with Atchison as its eastern terminus and the intention of connecting Kansas to the southwest by rail. Although construction was delayed by the Civil War, a land grant similar to the one given the Union Pacific to construct the first transcontinental railroad was made by the federal government to Kansas in 1863, which was transferred to the newly reformed Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad (AT&amp;SF). Finally, in 1868, construction was begun on the line in Topeka, but was aimed west and south towards the Colorado border. The connection between Atchison and Topeka, a distance of less than 50 miles, would not be completed until May, 1872.

The city tried to become a major railroad center, but was surpassed by Kansas City and Omaha, due to the former&#x27;s greater industrial capability and connections to Texas and the latter&#x27;s connection to Chicago, rather than St. Louis. Furthermore, Atchison boosters were unable to unite on a single project, instead scattering their efforts to the southwest, west and northwest, none of which proved successful. A proposed &quot;Atchison and Pike&#x27;s Peak&quot; line was eventually taken over by the Union Pacific, while a speculative Atchison-Nebraska connector was eventually finished and taken over by other investors. Bickering delayed the building of bridges, stockyards, elevators, warehouses and railroad yards, revealing the disharmony that plagued Atchison&#x27;s entrepreneurs.

However, with the completion of the connector to St. Joseph, which later became part of the Missouri Pacific, and the final connection to the growing AT&amp;SF system, industrialization reached Atchison. Grain elevators, flour mills, and a flax mill were all erected in Atchison in the late 1860s and early 1870s. Several prominent businessmen in town lured Captain John Seaton, who operated a foundry in Alton, Illinois, to town to improve the Atchison Foundry and Machine Works in 1872. It soon began turning out decorative wrought iron fences, spiral staircases, and hitching posts for horses. The foundry expanded quickly, as Seaton transported his entire Alton operation to Atchison to establish the Seaton Foundry. It employed over 200 men and had a payroll of more than $14,000 per month in 1872. Expanding rapidly in the coming years, it was known as Seaton Lea for most of the 1870s, becoming the Atchison Foundry and Machine Works in 1880. A branch location was constructed in Lincoln, Nebraska in 1881, but closed in 1887. In 1905, the Locomotive Finished Materials Company was established by Harry E. Muchnic, formerly of the AT&amp;SF railroad, which produced finished materials for the construction of railroad locomotives in close conjunction with Seaton&#x27;s foundry. The companies eventually merged in 1914 after the 1912 death of John Seaton.

After his arrival in 1872, John Seaton became one of the leading citizens of Atchison. Besides establishing the foundry which became the center of the town&#x27;s industry, he also owned the local theater, served on the school board, was elected to the Kansas Legislature in 1889, served on the Kansas Penitentiary Board, and was nominated for Governor of Kansas. He died on January 12, 1912. 

In 1914, Harry Muchnic invented a revolutionary diesel locomotive piston ring. In 1924 the John Seaton Foundry built an electric arc melting furnace for efficient smelting. In 1924 Atchison began the transition from iron to steel which paved the transition from steam locomotives to diesel locomotives. The first steel locomotive truck assembly was designed, cast, and assembled in 1934. In 1938 LFM was making 18 locomotive assemblies every day for General Motors-Electric Motive Division (EMD) and continued to be a key supplier of components to EMD.

In 1958 Rockwell purchased the LFM Steel Foundry to make locomotive trucks for EMD and GM (Progress Rail). Rockwell&#x27;s Transit Truck Design Group was established in 1960. Rockwell Manufacturing and Rockwell International were the owners from 1956 to 1993 and they renamed the LFM to Atchison Casting Corporation (ACC) in 1991. Atchison Casting became a publicly held corporation in 1994. ACC bought the Old Canadian Steel Foundry in Montreal, Canada from Hawker Siddeley in 1995. The foundry has primarily become a producer of rail transport components, including commuter rail truck frames for commuter rail systems in San Francisco, Chicago, Atlanta, and Washington, D.C. It has also undergone various mergers, reorganizations, and renamings, most recently after it was purchased by Bradken, a global manufacturing company headquartered in Australia.

==Geography==
The city lies along the western bank of the Missouri River, which also marks the Kansas-Missouri state line. Located at the junction of U.S. Route 59 and U.S. Route 73, it is southwest of St. Joseph, Missouri, along US-59 and northwest of Leavenworth Kansas, along US-73. The section of US-73 between Atchison and Leavenworth is part of the Glacial Hills Scenic Byway, which follows K-7 northward from Atchison.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The community is served by Atchison USD 409 public school district, which operates four schools, and serves more than 1,600 students. In 1997 the Atchison Public Schools closed six of its neighborhood school buildings to open one large elementary school. Although schools had been desegregated for more than 50 years, this move ensured more diversity and equality of education by uniting different segments of the city&#x27;s children into one school. A few of the old neighborhood schools still stand - one, known as Lincoln school at 810 Division Street was historically a segregated school for black children. Many entities have attempted to restore Lincoln School, which is on the Kansas State Register of Historic Places.

<text>Hardtner is a city in Barber County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 167. It is located 1 mile north of the Kansas / Oklahoma state border.

==History==
Hardtner was founded in 1887. It was named for Dr. John Hardtner, a landowner.

The first post office in Hardtner was established in July 1887.

By 1908 the townspeople had realized that they would need a railroad line to the outside world in order to survive. The town&#x27;s founder Jacob Achenbach, helped set up a company to build a line east to Kiowa. The line would have to cross the Santa Fe&#x27;s tracks to link with the Missouri Pacific, the planned connection for Hardtner&#x27;s line. The Santa Fe&#x27;s Superintendent was not about to stand for that, so he had his private car block the spot where the lines would cross. A local got word to him that the Hardtner people had about 45 cowboys ready to &quot;riddle his car with bullets&quot; The Superintendent moved his car, and the line was completed.

On June 2, 1929, an F2 tornado struck Hardtner, causing minor damage. The tornado tracked 12.2 miles and was notable since it moved very slowly, yielding some of the highest quality photographs of a tornado to that date.

Hardtner is also known for its yearly Independence Day celebrations. This event attracts people from all around the Kansas/Oklahoma state-line area. Yearly events include a themed parade, medallion hunt, pit beef sandwiches, and a fireworks show.
