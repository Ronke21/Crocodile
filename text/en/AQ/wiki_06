<text>Cyberjaya (a portmanteau of &quot;cyber&quot; and &quot;Putrajaya&quot;) is a city with a science park as its core that forms part of Greater Kuala Lumpur, in Malaysia. It is located in Sepang District, Selangor. Cyberjaya is adjacent to and developed along with Putrajaya, Malaysia&#x27;s government seat. The city aspires to be known as the [[Silicon Valley]] of Malaysia.

The official opening ceremony for Cyberjaya was held on 17 May 1997 by then-Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad.

Many multinational companies and data centres are located in the city.

==History==

Until 1975, what is today Cyberjaya, Putrajaya and Dengkil were under the administration of Hulu Langat (Kajang) district. On the site of today&#x27;s Cyberjaya once stood an estate, &quot;Prang Besar&quot; (Great War).

The idea of an IT-themed city, Cyberjaya, arose out of a study by management consultancy McKinsey for the Multimedia Super Corridor commissioned by the Federal Government of Malaysia in 1995. The implementation agency was the Town &amp; Country Planning Department of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. The catalyst is the agreement by NTT in 1996 to site an R&amp;D centre at a site to the west of the new Malaysian administration centre, Putrajaya.

Multimedia Development Corporation (MDEC, then known as MDC), the agency overseeing the implementation of the MSC was located in Cyberjaya to oversee the creation. The real estate implementation was privatised to Cyberview Sdn Bhd (Cyberview) in early 1997. At the time, Cyberview was set up a joint-venture comprising entities such as Setia Haruman Sdn Bhd (SHSB), Nippon Telephone and Telegraph (NTT), Golden Hope, MDEC, Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB) and Kumpulan Darul Ehsan Berhad (KDEB), representative of the Selangor Government. SHSB, a consortium comprising Renong, Landmarks, MKLand and Country Heights, was asked to take the lead regarding the development. Federal government-linked companies Telekom Malaysia and Tenaga Nasional were conscripted to provide the telecommunication and power supply infrastructure. The ambitious plan was to develop the first phase, comprising 1,430 hectares by 2006, with the remaining 1,460 hectares to be developed after the year 2011. The engineering management consultant, Pengurusan Lebuhraya Bhd (now acquired by Opus International Malaysia) was appointed to manage the construction of utilities and infrastructure, overseeing major construction firms of Peremba and United Engineers Malaysia (UEM).
However, due to the late 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, the undertaking was deemed no longer viable and necessitated the Government taking over of the 55% and 15% stake in Cyberview shares held by SHSB and NTT respectively via the Ministry of Finance Inc. (MOF Inc.). The transaction gave MOF Inc a 70% stake, and Cyberview has remained a government-owned company ever since. Cyberview then entered into an agreement with SHSB with shareholders comprising Country Heights Holdings Berhad (CHHB), Landmarks, Menara Embun (an MKLand Controlled Company) and Renong (now UEM World) with equal shares of 25%; granting SHSB the right to develop Cyberjaya as the master developer, while Cyberview became the landowner. In 2004, CHHB and Landmarks sold their equity interest in SHSB to MKLand-controlled companies, namely Modern Eden (12.5%), Impressive Circuits (12.5%) and Virtual Path (25%), resulting in MKLand-controlled companies becoming the majority shareholder of SHSB.

Cyberview&#x27;s role grew to include implementing various development and government initiatives, while SHSB carried on its role as the master developer. In addition to this, Cyberview was also tasked to undertake citywide maintenance and spearhead investor interface and community-centric programmes in Cyberjaya.

In August 2008, Cyberjaya was awarded the &quot;Best Brand in National ICT Hub&quot; under the Corporate Branding category at the BrandLaureate Award 2007-2008.

==Physical development==

Spanning about 28.94 square kilometres (7,000 acres), the city is the nucleus of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC), until 2022 known as MSC Malaysia, since then rebranded into Malaysia Digital (MD). The site for Cyberjaya was primarily undeveloped land consisting of oil palm plantations. It has since seen extensive building activities, including a boutique hotel, numerous commercial buildings, offices for MSC (now &quot;MD&quot;) Status companies, universities, a community club, and the local council&#x27;s headquarters.

It was built as a future city, but no goals toward this end have been announced. The Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC, formerly Multimedia Development Corporation - MDC), the agency tasked with spearheading the MSC&#x27;s progress, has its headquarters in the heart of Cyberjaya.

Setia Haruman also undertakes to install properties such as office buildings, retail space and apartment suites to meet the market&#x27;s demand. Apart from being a Master Developer of Cyberjaya, Setia Haruman also wears the hat as a Property Developer and has constructed commercial, residential and enterprise buildings to meet the thriving community&#x27;s demands in Cyberjaya.

===Office and commercial facilities===
Many companies who qualify for MSC incentives have relocated their operations to Cyberjaya. Among them are:

* Huawei

* Monster.com 

Over 500 MSC status (since 2022 rebranded to &quot;MD&quot; status) companies have currently located their operations here, making the township a rapidly growing area.

==Population==

The day-time population in Cyberjaya is about 140,000 and expected to increase to 350,000 by 2039.

===Residential areas===
High rise residential and integrated developments include Cristal Serin Residence, Lakefront Residence, Shaftsbury Square, D&#x27;Pulze, Serin Residency, Cybersquare, Crystal, The Place, Pangea, Arc, D&#x27;Melor, Domain, Cyberia smart homes, Masreca19, etc. Landed housing includes Sejati Residences, Symphony Hills, Garden Residence, Summer Glades, Mirage by the Lake, Taman Pinggiran Cyber and Setia Eco Glades. With the many upcoming developments, there will be at least an additional 10,000 residential units in the next two years. Its perceived Garden Residence, Cyberjaya, is the most strategic landed properties in Cyberjaya due to its proximity to SkyPark, IOI Resort City Mall and the two MRT line 2 stations in the vicinity. Adding to that, the upcoming development around Garden Residence, Cyberjaya will be the developments of Cyberjaya City Centre, a stone throw away from Garden Residence in the next five years worth 15 billion gross development value. 

== Infrastructure ==

===Communications===
To support the aspiration to host multimedia industries, Cyberjaya was specified with extensive and intensive fibre optic cabling. As Malaysia&#x27;s premier IT hub, Cyberjaya has a telecommunication backbone running primarily on fibre optics known as Cyberjaya Metro Fibre Network (CMFN). Operated by Allo Technology Sdn Bhd (formerly known as Setia Haruman Technology Sdn Bhd). CMFN is a carrier-neutral and open-access infrastructure where multi-leading Telco/Carriers/ISPs are riding on CMFN&#x27;s fibre optic network to provide their services to end customers in Cyberjaya. CMFN delivers fibre connectivity straight to the building under the concepts of &quot;Fibre-To-The-Building (FTTB)&quot; and &quot;Fibre-To-The-Home (FTTH)&quot;. As such, most of the commercial buildings and offices are connected to CMFN. With the ring topology; CMFN offers full redundancy throughout the network – with the availability of high capacity and resiliency network, many data centres are located here and connected to CMFN. However, some older commercial and residential units still use copper lines to provide &quot;last mile&quot; access to customers. Broadband access covering wireless and fixed-line is readily available. Broadband access is serviced primarily by Cyberjaya Broadband (City Broadband), Time, TMnet, NTT MSC.

===Backup electrical supply===
The Cyberjaya planning guidelines strongly required two electrical connections from two separate substations. Diesel generators up to full load (except air conditioning load) were specified to be installed in all commercial buildings. The electricity grid connection was also organised to enable &quot;power islanding&quot; and supported by the Serdang Power Station. The electricity service standard is set at 99.99% availability with a maximum of 10 seconds interruption for office and commercial areas and maximum 15 minutes interruption for residential areas. These measures were dreamed up to provide Cyberjaya with a comparative advantage against other Multimedia Super Corridor areas. However, Tenaga Nasional has extended the same standard to all urban areas connected to the National Grid in Malaysia.

=== District cooling ===
The use of district cooling system, where chilled water from a central plant is provided to run the air conditioning, was laid extensively in the central district. The promise is the economical use of off-peak electricity at night to chill water for air conditioning use during the day. Pendinginan Megajana Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of Cyberview, is the provider for this service.

===Data centres===
Several data centres operate in Cyberjaya. Notable are those operated by T-Systems for Shell, NTT MSC, BMW and DHL. A small scale Data Centre ideal for Small &amp; Medium Enterprises (SMEs) is located at City Command Center Cyberjaya (CCC) Data Centre that provides Rack Location Unit (RLU) space rental and server co-location. There are also carrier-neutral, purpose-built high-end data centre facilities in Cyberjaya such as CX1, CX2 and CX5 – managed by CSF Advisers (a CSF Group member) plc CSF Group), Basis Bay and MyTelehaus. There are also few government agencies&#x27; purpose-built data centre facilities in Cyberjaya, such as Central Bank (Bank Negara Malaysia) and the Road Transport Department. Malaysia&#x27;s incumbent Telco, Telekom Malaysia (TM) also has its purpose-built data centre facilities in Cyberjaya.

===Call centres===
Several call centres &amp; service desk operate in Cyberjaya. Notables are those operated by HP, IBM, HSBC.

===Office space===
Initially, 8 blocks of office buildings were built by the developer. These are purpose-built for multimedia companies by being provided extra height ceiling and underfloor trunking (some with raised floor), fibre optic wiring, dual redundant power supply, uninterruptible power supply and back up generators for whole electricity load, which common practice in Malaysia is only to 30% load.

Presently, there are more than 30 completed office buildings in Cyberjaya catering for multi-tenants and single tenants. Government agencies&#x27; presence will also increase once the Bank Negara Data Centre and Road and Transport Department&#x27;s IT Centre buildings are completed.

This city is also looking forward to developing the Knowledge Workers Development Institute (KWDI) and the Creative Multimedia Cluster, both by Cyberview, which are targeted for completion in 2009.

MKN Embassy Techzone, is a freehold ICT business park project on approximately of prime Cyberjaya land in the flagship zone lease to multinational companies. MKN Embassy Development Sdn develops the project. Bhd., a joint venture company between EMKAY Group of Malaysia and Embassy Group of India, is a strategic partner for the EMKAY group in developing this specialised ICT building.

===Cyberjaya-TV===
Cyberjaya-TV was conceived in late 2009 to showcase Cyberjaya&#x27;s &quot;Live, Study, Work &amp; Play&quot; elements. Contents developed, primarily, relate to Cyberjaya, which provides a means for people worldwide to sample part of the thriving Cyberjaya community.

<text>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, commonly abbreviated as ASEAN, is a political and economic union of 10 states in Southeast Asia. Together, its member states represent a population of more than 600 million people and land area of over . The bloc generated a purchasing power parity (PPP) gross domestic product (GDP) of around trillion in 2022, constituting approximately 6.5% of global GDP (PPP). ASEAN member states include some of the fastest growing economies in the world, and the institution plays an integral role in East Asian regionalism.

The primary objectives of ASEAN, as stated by the association, are &quot;to accelerate economic growth, social progress and cultural development in the region&quot;, and &quot;to promote regional peace and stability through abiding respect for justice and the rule of law in the relationship among countries in the region and adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter.&quot; In recent years, the bloc has broadened its objectives beyond economic and social spheres.

ASEAN engages with other supranational entities in the Asia-Pacific region and other parts of the world. It is a major partner of the , , , , MERCOSUR, , and . It also hosts diplomatic missions throughout the world, maintaining a global network of relationships that is widely regarded as the central forum for cooperation in the region. Its success has become the driving force of some of the largest trade blocs in history, including and .

==History==

===Founding===
The predecessor of ASEAN was the Association of Southeast Asia (ASA), formed on 31 July 1961 and consisting of Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaya. ASEAN itself was created on 8 August 1967, when the foreign ministers of five countries—Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand—signed the ASEAN Declaration. According to the Declaration, ASEAN aims to accelerate economic, social, and cultural development in the region, as well as promoting regional peace, to collaborate on matters of shared interest, and to promote Southeast Asian studies and maintain close cooperation with existing international organisations.

The creation of ASEAN was initially motivated by the desire to contain communism, which had taken a foothold in mainland Asia after World War II, with the formation of communist governments in North Korea, China, and Vietnam, accompanied by the so-called communist &quot;emergency&quot; in British Malaya, and unrest in the recently decolonized Philippines.

These events also encouraged the earlier formation of the South East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), led by the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia, with several Southeast Asian partners in 1954 as an extension of &quot;containment&quot; policy, seeking to create an Eastern version of NATO. However, the local member states of ASEAN group achieved greater cohesion in the mid-1970s following a change in the balance of power after the Fall of Saigon and the end of the Vietnam War in April 1975 and the decline of SEATO.

ASEAN&#x27;s first summit meeting, held in Bali, Indonesia, in 1976, resulted in an agreement on several industrial projects and the signing of a Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, and a Declaration of Concord. The end of the Cold War allowed ASEAN countries to exercise greater political independence in the region, and in the 1990s, ASEAN emerged as a leading voice on regional trade and security issues.

On 15 December 1995, the Southeast Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty was signed to turn Southeast Asia into a nuclear-weapon-free zone. The treaty took effect on 28 March 1997 after all but one of the member states had ratified it. It became fully effective on 21 June 2001 after the Philippines ratified it, effectively banning all nuclear weapons in the region.

===Expansion===
On 7 January 1984, Brunei became ASEAN&#x27;s sixth member and on 28 July 1995, following the end of the Cold War, Vietnam joined as the seventh member. Laos and Myanmar (formerly Burma) joined two years later on 23 July 1997. Cambodia was to join at the same time as Laos and Myanmar, but a Cambodian coup in 1997 and other internal instability delayed its entry. It then joined on 30 April 1999 following the stabilization of its government.

In 2006, ASEAN was given observer status at the United Nations General Assembly. In response, the organization awarded the status of &quot;dialogue partner&quot; to the UN.

===Commonality===
Besides their close geographic proximity, political scholars consider Southeast Asian nations a cultural crossroads between East Asia and South Asia, located at critical junctions of the South China Sea as well as the Indian Ocean, and as a result received much influence from Islamic and Persian influences prior to the European colonial ages.

Since around 100 BCE, the Southeast Asian archipelago occupied a central position at the crossroads of the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea trading routes, which stimulated the economy and the influx of ideas. This included the introduction of abugida scripts to Southeast Asia as well as the Chinese script to Vietnam. Besides various indigenous scripts, various abugida Brahmic scripts were widespread in both continental and insular Southeast Asia. Historically, scripts such as Pallava, Kawi (from ancient Tamil script) and Rencong or &quot;Surat Ulu&quot; were used to write Old Malay, until they were replaced by Jawi during Islamic missionary missions in the Malay Archipelago.

European colonialism influenced most ASEAN countries, including French Indochina (present-day Vietnam, Laos &amp; Cambodia), British Burma, Malaya and Borneo (present-day Myanmar, Malaysia &amp; Singapore, and Brunei), Dutch East Indies (present day Indonesia), Spanish East Indies (present-day Philippines and various other colonies), and Portuguese Timor (present-day Timor-Leste), with only Thailand (then Siam) not formed from a prior European colony. Siam served as the buffer state, sandwiched between British Burma and French Indochina, but its kings had to contend with unequal treaties as well as British and French political interference and territorial losses after the Franco-Siamese conflict of 1893 and the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909. Under European colonization, Southeast Asian nations were introduced to European religions and technologies, as well as the Latin alphabet.

The Japanese Empire, in the vein of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere concept, sought to unite and create a pan-Asian identity against Western colonial occupation, but Japan&#x27;s alliance with the Axis powers in World War II soured relations between many colonies of Europe and the United States. Defeat of Imperial Japan eventuated in decolonization movements throughout Southeast Asia, resulting in the independent ASEAN states seen today.

===The ASEAN Charter===

On 15 December 2008, the member states met in Jakarta to launch the charter signed in November 2007, to move closer to &quot;an EU-style community&quot;. The charter formally established ASEAN as a legal entity, aiming to create a single trade bloc for a region encompassing 500 million people. Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono stated: &quot;This is a momentous development when ASEAN is consolidating, integrating, and transforming itself into a community. It is achieved while ASEAN seeks a more vigorous role in Asian and global affairs at a time when the international system is experiencing a seismic shift&quot;. Referring to climate change and economic upheaval, he concluded: &quot;Southeast Asia is no longer the bitterly divided, war-torn region it was in the 1960s and 1970s&quot;.

The financial crisis of 2007–2008 was seen as a threat to the charter&#x27;s goals, and also set forth the idea of a proposed human rights body to be discussed at a future summit in February 2009. This proposition caused controversy, although the body would not have the power to impose sanctions or punish countries which violated citizens&#x27; rights and would, therefore, be limited in effectiveness. The body was established later in 2009 as the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR).

In November 2012, the commission adopted the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration. However, their human rights declaration has been critiqued widely by the international community, with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights stating that the declaration was worded in problematic ways that do not easily align with international norms. Likewise, the Human Rights Watch in the United States of America noted several important fundamental rights were omitted or not clearly established.

The chairmanship of ASEAN rotates among the member states. Malaysia holds the position for 2025. Recent ASEAN chairs are as follows: 
===Public health===
In response to pandemics, ASEAN has coordinated with ASEAN+3 and other actors to create a regional public health response.

====SARS outbreak====
During the SARS outbreak, ASEAN and ASEAN+3 worked together to devise a response to the outbreak. Immediate and short-to-medium term measures were devised. The parties agreed to enhance sharing of best practices against the disease while also agreeing to bolster collaboration between their respective health authorities and harmonize travel procedures to ensure that proper health screening would occur. In addition, China offered to contribute $1.2 million to the ASEAN SARS fund, made both to show that it was willing to cooperate with the rest of the region and make amends for its withholding of information during the initial stages of the outbreak.

====H1N1 pandemic====
ASEAN held a special meeting between ASEAN and ASEAN+3 health ministers on 8 May 2009, on responding to the H1N1 pandemic. At this meeting, it was agreed that hotlines would be established between public health authorities, joint response teams would be formed, and ongoing research efforts would be bolstered.

===Myanmar crisis===
Since 2017, political, military and ethnic affairs in Myanmar have posed unusual challenges for ASEAN, creating precedent-breaking situations and threatening the traditions and unity of the group, and its global standing—with ASEAN responses indicating possible fundamental change in the nature of the organization.

====Rohingya genocide====
The Rohingya genocide erupting in Myanmar in August 2017—killing thousands of Rohingya people in Myanmar, driving most into neighboring Bangladesh, and continuing for months—created a global outcry demanding ASEAN take action against the civilian-military coalition government of Myanmar, which had long discriminated against the Rohingya, and had launched the 2017 attacks upon them.
====2021 Myanmar coup====

On 1 February 2021, the day before a newly elected slate of civilian leaders was to take office in Myanmar, a military junta overthrew Myanmar&#x27;s civilian government in a coup d&#x27;etat, declaring a national state of emergency, imposing martial law, arresting elected civilian leaders, violently clamping down on dissent, and replacing civilian government with the military&#x27;s appointees. Widespread protests and resistance erupted, and elements of the civilian leadership formed an underground &quot;National Unity Government&quot; (NUG). Global opposition to the coup emerged, and global pressure was brought on ASEAN to take action.

==Member states==

===List of member states===
=== Observer states ===
There are currently two states seeking accession to ASEAN: Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste. 

* Accession of Papua New Guinea to ASEAN (observer status since 1976)
* Accession of Timor-Leste to ASEAN (observer status since 2002, &quot;in principle&quot; status since 2022)

==Demographics==
, the population of the ASEAN was about 655 million people (8.5% of the world population). In ASEAN in 2019, 55.2 million children were age 0–4 and 46.3 million people were older than 65. This corresponds to 8.4% and 7.1% of the total ASEAN population. The region&#x27;s population growth is 1.1% per year. Thailand is the lowest at 0.2% per year, and Cambodia is the highest at 1.9% per year. ASEAN&#x27;s sex ratio is 0.996 males per female, with 326.4 million males and 327.8 million females.

===Urban areas===
The 20 largest metropolitan areas within ASEAN are as follows.
==The ASEAN Way==
The &quot;ASEAN Way&quot; refers to a methodology or approach to solving issues that respect Southeast Asia&#x27;s cultural norms. Masilamani and Peterson summarise it as:A working process or style that is informal and personal. Policymakers constantly utilise compromise, consensus, and consultation in the informal decision-making process... it above all prioritises a consensus-based, non-conflictual way of addressing problems. Quiet diplomacy allows ASEAN leaders to communicate without bringing the discussions into the public view. Members avoid the embarrassment that may lead to further conflict. It has been said that the merits of the ASEAN Way might &quot;be usefully applied to global conflict management&quot;. However, critics have argued that such an approach can be only applied to Asian countries, to specific cultural norms and understandings notably, due to a difference in mindset and level of tension. Critics object, claiming that the ASEAN Way&#x27;s emphasis on consultation, consensus, and non-interference forces the organization to adopt only those policies which satisfy the lowest common denominator. Decision-making by consensus requires members to see eye-to-eye before ASEAN can move forward on an issue. Members may not have a common conception of the meaning of the ASEAN Way. Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos emphasize non-interference while older member countries focus on co-operation and co-ordination. These differences hinder efforts to find common solutions to particular issues, but also make it difficult to determine when collective action is appropriate in a given situation.
==Structure==
Beginning in 1997, heads of each member state adopted the ASEAN Vision 2020 during the group&#x27;s 30th anniversary meeting held in Kuala Lumpur. As a means for the realization of a single ASEAN community, this vision provides provisions on peace and stability, a nuclear-free region, closer economic integration, human development, sustainable development, cultural heritage, being a drug-free region, environment among others. The vision also aimed to &quot;see an outward-looking ASEAN playing a pivotal role in the international fora, and advancing ASEAN&#x27;s common interests&quot;.

ASEAN Vision 2020 was formalized and made comprehensive through the Bali Concord II in 2003.

Three major pillars of a single ASEAN community were established:

* Political-Security Community (APSC)
* Economic Community (AEC)
* Socio-Cultural Community (ASCC)

To fully embody the three pillars as part of the 2015 integration, blueprints for APSC and ASCC were subsequently adopted in 2009 in Cha-am, Thailand. The ASEAN Community, initially planned to commence by 2020, was accelerated to begin by 31 December 2015. It was decided during the 12th ASEAN Summit in Cebu in 2007.
===AEC Blueprint===
The AEC aims to &quot;implement economic integration initiatives&quot; to create a single market for member states. The blueprint that serves as a comprehensive guide for the establishment of the community was adopted on 20 November 2007 at the 13th ASEAN Summit in Singapore. Its characteristics include a single market and production base, a highly competitive economic region, a region of fair economic development, and a region fully integrated into the global economy. The areas of cooperation include human resources development, recognition of professional qualifications, closer consultation economic policies, enhanced infrastructure and communications connectivity, integrating industries for regional sourcing, and strengthening private sector involvement. Through the free movement of skilled labor, goods, services and investment, ASEAN would rise globally as one market, thus increasing its competitiveness and opportunities for development.

===APSC Blueprint===
During the 14th ASEAN Summit, the group adopted the APSC Blueprint. This document is aimed at creating a robust political-security environment within ASEAN, with programs and activities outlined to establish the APSC by 2016. It is based on the ASEAN Charter, the ASEAN Security Community Plan of Action, and the Vientiane Action Program. The APSC aims to create a sense of responsibility toward comprehensive security and a dynamic, outward-looking region in an increasingly integrated and interdependent world.

The ASEAN Defense Industry Collaboration (ADIC) was proposed at the 4th ASEAN Defense Ministers&#x27; Meeting (ADMM) on 11 May 2010 in Hanoi. It has the purpose, among others, to reduce defense imports from non-ASEAN countries by half and to further develop the defense industry in the region. It was formally adopted on the next ADMM on 19 May 2011, in Jakarta, Indonesia. The main focus is to industrially and technologically boost the security capability of ASEAN, consistent with the principles of flexibility and non-binding and voluntary participation among the member states. The concept revolves around education and capability-building programs to develop the skills and capabilities of the workforce, production of capital for defense products, and the provision of numerous services to address the security needs of each member state. It also aims to develop an intra-ASEAN defense trade. ADIC aims to establish a strong defense industry relying on the local capabilities of each member state and limit annual procurement from external original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Countries like the US, Germany, Russia, France, Italy, UK, China, South Korea, Israel, and the Netherlands are among the major suppliers to ASEAN. ASEAN defense budget rose by 147% from 2004 to 2013 and is expected to rise further in the future. Factors affecting the increase include economic growth, ageing equipment, and the plan to strengthen the establishment of the defense industry. ASEANAPOL is also established to enhance cooperation on law enforcement and crime control among police forces of member states.

===ASCC Blueprint===

The ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community (ASCC) was also adopted during the 14th ASEAN Summit. It envisions an &quot;ASEAN Community that is people-centered and socially responsible with a view to achieving enduring solidarity and unity among the countries and peoples of ASEAN by forging a common identity and building a caring and sharing society which is inclusive and harmonious where the well-being, livelihood, and welfare of the peoples are enhanced&quot;. Among its focus areas include human development, social welfare and protection, social justice and rights, environmental sustainability, building the ASEAN identity, and narrowing the development gap.

To track the progress of the AEC, a compliance tool called the AEC Scorecard was developed based on the EU Internal Market Scorecard. It is the only one in effect and is expected to serve as an unbiased assessment tool to measure the extent of integration and the economic health of the region. It is expected to provide relevant information about regional priorities, and thus foster productive, inclusive, and sustainable growth. It makes it possible to monitor the implementation of ASEAN agreements, and the achievement of milestones indicated in the AEC Strategic Schedule. The scorecard outlines specific actions that must be undertaken collectively and individually to establish AEC by 2015. To date, two official scorecards have been published, one in 2010, and the other in 2012. However, the scorecard is purely quantitative, as it only examines whether a member state has performed the AEC task or not. The more &quot;yes&quot; answers, the higher the score.
====APAEC blueprint====
Part of the work towards the ASEAN Economic Community is the integration of the energy systems of the ASEAN member states. The blueprint for this integration is provided by the ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation (APAEC). APAEC is managed by the ASEAN Center for Energy.

====2020 ASEAN Banking Integration Framework====
As trade is liberalized with the integration in 2015, the need arises for ASEAN banking institutions to accommodate and expand their services to an intra-ASEAN market. Experts, however, have already forecast a shaky economic transition, especially for smaller players in the banking and financial services industry. Two separate reports by Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s (S&amp;P) outline the challenges that ASEAN financial institutions face as they prepare for the 2020 banking integration. The reports point out that overcrowded banking sector in the Philippines is expected to feel the most pressure as the integration welcomes tighter competition with bigger and more established foreign banks. As a result, there needs to be a regional expansion by countries with a small banking sector to lessen the impact of the post-integration environment. In a follow-up report, S&amp;P recently cited the Philippines for &quot;shoring up its network bases and building up capital ahead of the banking integration – playing defense and strengthening their domestic networks&quot;.

====Financial integration roadmap====
The roadmap for financial integration is the latest regional initiative that aims to strengthen local self-help and support mechanisms. The roadmap&#x27;s implementation would contribute to the realization of the AEC. Adoption of a common currency, when conditions are ripe, could be the final stage of the AEC. The roadmap identifies approaches and milestones in capital market development, capital account and financial services liberalization, and ASEAN currency cooperation. Capital market development entails promoting institutional capacity as well as the facilitation of greater cross-border collaboration, linkages, and harmonization between capital markets. Orderly capital account liberalization would be promoted with adequate safeguards against volatility and systemic risks. To expedite the process of financial services liberalization, ASEAN has agreed on a positive list modality and adopted milestones to facilitate negotiations. Currency cooperation would involve the exploration of possible currency arrangements, including an ASEAN currency payment system for trade in local goods to reduce the demand for US dollars and to help promote stability of regional currencies, such as by settling intra-ASEAN trade using regional currencies.
====Food security====
Member states recognize the importance of strengthening food security to maintain stability and prosperity in the region. As ASEAN moves towards AEC and beyond, food security would be an integral part of the community-building agenda. Strengthened food security is even more relevant in light of potentially severe risks from climate change with agriculture and fisheries being the most affected industries.

Part of the aim of ASEAN integration is to achieve food security collectively via trade in rice and maize. Trade facilitation measures and the harmonization/equivalency of food regulation and control standards would reduce the cost of trade in food products. While specialization and revealed comparative and competitive indices point to complementarities between trade patterns among the member states, intra-ASEAN trade in agriculture is quite small, something that integration could address. The MARKET project would provide flexible and demand-driven support to the ASEAN Secretariat while bringing more private-sector and civil-society input into regional agriculture policy dialogue. By building an environment that reduces barriers to trade, ASEAN trade would increase, thereby decreasing the risk of food price crisis.

==Economy==


The group sought economic integration by creating the AEC by the end of 2015 that established a single market. The average economic growth of member states from 1989 to 2009 was between 3.8% and 7%. This was greater than the average growth of APEC, which was 2.8%. The ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), established on 28 January 1992, includes a Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) to promote the free flow of goods between member states. ASEAN had only six members when it was signed. The new member states (Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia) have not fully met AFTA&#x27;s obligations, but are officially considered part of the agreement as they were required to sign it upon entry into ASEAN, and were given longer time frames to meet AFTA&#x27;s tariff reduction obligations. The next steps are to create a single market and production base, a competitive economic region, a region of equitable economic development, and a region that is fully integrated into the global economy. Since 2007, ASEAN countries have gradually lowered their import duties to member states, with a target of zero import duties by 2016.

ASEAN countries have many economic zones (industrial parks, eco-industrial parks, special economic zones, technology parks, and innovation districts) (see reference for comprehensive list from 2015).
In 2018, eight of the ASEAN members are among the world&#x27;s outperforming economies, with positive long-term prospect for the region. ASEAN&#x27;s Secretariat projects that the regional body will grow to become the world&#x27;s fourth largest economy by 2030.

The ASEAN Centre for Energy publishes the ASEAN Energy Outlook every five years, analysing and promoting the integration of national energy systems across the region. The sixth edition was published in 2020.

===Internal market===
ASEAN planned to establish a single market based upon the four freedoms by the end of 2015, with the goal of ensuring free flow of goods, services, skilled labour, and capital. The ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) was formed in 2015, but the group deferred about 20% of the harmonization provisions needed to create a common market and set a new deadline of 2025.

Until the end of 2010, intra-ASEAN trade was still low as trade involved mainly exports to countries outside the region, with the exception of Laos and Myanmar, whose foreign trade was ASEAN-oriented. In 2009, realised foreign direct investment (FDI) was US$37.9 billion and increased two-fold in 2010 to US$75.8 billion. 22% of FDI came from the European Union, followed by ASEAN countries (16%), and by Japan and the United States.

The ASEAN Framework Agreement on Trade in Services (AFAS) was adopted at the ASEAN Summit in Bangkok in December 1995. Under the agreement, member states enter into successive rounds of negotiations to liberalise trade in services with the aim of submitting increasingly higher levels of commitment. ASEAN has concluded seven packages of commitments under AFAS.

Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) have been agreed upon by ASEAN for eight professions: physicians, dentists, nurses, architects, engineers, accountants, surveyors, and tourism professionals. Individuals in these professions will be free to work in any ASEAN states effective 31 December 2015.

In addition, six member states (Malaysia, Vietnam (2 exchanges), Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore) have collaborated on integrating their stock exchanges, which includes 70% of its transaction values with the goal to compete with international exchanges.

Single market will also include the ASEAN Single Aviation Market (ASEAN-SAM), the region&#x27;s aviation policy geared towards the development of a unified and single aviation market in Southeast Asia. It was proposed by the ASEAN Air Transport Working Group, supported by the ASEAN Senior Transport Officials Meeting, and endorsed by the ASEAN Transport Ministers. It is expected to liberalise air travel between member states allowing ASEAN airlines to benefit directly from the growth in air travel, and also free up tourism, trade, investment, and service flows. Since 1 December 2008, restrictions on the third and fourth freedoms of the air between capital cities of member states for air passenger services have been removed, while from 1 January 2009, full liberalisation of air freight services in the region took effect. On 1 January 2011, full liberalisation on fifth freedom traffic rights between all capital cities took effect. This policy supersedes existing unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral air services agreements among member states which are inconsistent with its provisions.

===Monetary union===
The concept of an Asian Currency Unit (ACU) started in the middle of the 1990s, prior to the 1997 Asian financial crisis. It is a proposed basket of Asian currencies, similar to the European Currency Unit, which was the precursor of the Euro. The Asian Development Bank is responsible for exploring the feasibility and construction of the basket. Since the ACU is being considered to be a precursor to a common currency, it has a dynamic outlook of the region. The overall goal of a common currency is to contribute to the financial stability of a regional economy, including price stability. It means lower cost of cross-border business through the elimination of currency risk. Greater flows of intra-trade would put pressure on prices, resulting in cheaper goods and services. Individuals benefit not only from the lowering of prices, they save by not having to change money when travelling, by being able to compare prices more readily, and by the reduced cost of transferring money across borders.

However, there are conditions for a common currency: the intensity of intra-regional trade and the convergence of macroeconomic conditions. Substantial intra-ASEAN trade (which is growing, partly as a result of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the ASEAN Economic Community.) and economic integration is an incentive for a monetary union. Member states currently trade more with other countries (80%) than among themselves (20%). Therefore, their economies are more concerned about currency stability against major international currencies, like the US dollar. On macroeconomic conditions, member states have different levels of economic development, capacity, and priorities that translate into different levels of interest and readiness. Monetary integration, however, implies less control over national monetary and fiscal policy to stimulate the economy. Therefore, greater convergence in macroeconomic conditions is being enacted to improve conditions and confidence in a common currency. Other concerns include weaknesses in the financial sectors, inadequacy of regional-level resource pooling mechanisms and institutions required to form and manage a currency union, and lack of political preconditions for monetary co-operation and a common currency.

===Free trade===

In 1992, the Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme was adopted as a schedule for phasing out tariffs to increase the &quot;region&#x27;s competitive advantage as a production base geared for the world market&quot;. This law would act as the framework for the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), which is an agreement by member states concerning local manufacturing in ASEAN. It was signed on 28 January 1992 in Singapore.

Free trade initiatives in ASEAN are spearheaded by the implementation of the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) and the Agreement on Customs. These agreements are supported by several sector bodies to plan and to execute free trade measures, guided by the provisions and the requirements of ATIGA and the Agreement on Customs. They form a backbone for achieving targets of the AEC Blueprint and establishing the ASEAN Economic Community by the end of 2015.

On 26 August 2007, ASEAN stated its aim of completing free trade agreements (FTA) with China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, and New Zealand by 2013, which is in line with the start of the ASEAN Economic Community by 2015. In November 2007, ASEAN states signed the ASEAN Charter, a constitution governing relations among member states and establishing the group itself as an international legal entity. During the same year, the Cebu Declaration on East Asian Energy Security was signed by ASEAN and the other members of the EAS (Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea), which pursues energy security by finding energy alternatives to fossil fuels.

On 27 February 2009, an FTA with Australia and New Zealand was signed. It is believed that this FTA would boost combined GDP across the 12 countries by more than US$48 billion over the period between 2000 and 2020. The agreement with China created the ASEAN–China Free Trade Area (ACFTA), which went into full effect on 1 January 2010. In addition, ASEAN was noted to be negotiating an FTA with the European Union. Bilateral trade with India crossed the US$70 billion target in 2012 (target was to reach the level by 2015). Taiwan has also expressed interest in an agreement with ASEAN but needs to overcome diplomatic objections from China.

ASEAN, together with its six major trading partners (Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea), began the first round of negotiations on 26–28 February 2013, in Bali, Indonesia on the establishment of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which is an extension of ASEAN Plus Three and Six that covers 45% of the world&#x27;s population and about a third of the world&#x27;s total GDP.

In 2019, Reuters highlighted a mechanism used by traders to avoid the 70% tariff on ethanol imported into China from the United States, involving importing the fuel into Malaysia, mixing it with at least 40% ASEAN-produced fuel, and re-exporting it to China tariff-free under ACFTA rules.

===Electricity trade===
Cross-border electricity trade in ASEAN has been limited, despite efforts since 1997 to establish an ASEAN Power Grid and associated trade. Electricity trade accounts for only about 5% of the generation, whereas trades in coal and gas are 86% and 53% respectively.

===Tourism===
With the institutionalisation of visa-free travel between ASEAN member states, intra-ASEAN travel has escalated. In 2010, 47% or 34 million out of 73 million tourists in ASEAN member-states were from other ASEAN countries. Cooperation in tourism was formalised in 1976, following the formation of the Sub-Committee on Tourism (SCOT) under the ASEAN Committee on Trade and Tourism. The 1st ASEAN Tourism Forum was held on 18–26 October 1981 in Kuala Lumpur. In 1986, ASEAN Promotional Chapters for Tourism (APCT) were established in Hong Kong, West Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia/New Zealand, Japan, and North America.

Tourism has been one of the key growth sectors in ASEAN and has proven resilient amid global economic challenges. The wide array of tourist attractions across the region drew 109 million tourists to ASEAN in 2015, up by 34% compared to 81 million tourists in 2011. As of 2012, tourism was estimated to account for 4.6% of ASEAN GDP—10.9% when taking into account all indirect contributions. It directly employed 9.3 million people, or 3.2% of total employment, and indirectly supported some 25 million jobs. In addition, the sector accounted for an estimated 8% of total capital investment in the region. In January 2012, ASEAN tourism ministers called for the development of a marketing strategy. The strategy represents the consensus of ASEAN National Tourism Organisations (NTOs) on marketing directions for ASEAN moving forward to 2015. In the 2013 &quot;Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index&quot; (TTCI) report, Singapore placed 1st, Malaysia placed 8th, Thailand placed 9th, Indonesia placed 12th, Brunei placed 13th, Vietnam placed 16th, Philippines placed 17th, and Cambodia placed 20th as the top destinations of travellers in the Asia Pacific region.

1981 The ASEAN Tourism Forum (ATF) was established. It is a regional meeting of NGOs, Ministers, sellers, buyers and journalists to promote the ASEAN countries as a single one tourist destination. The annual event 2019 in Ha Long marks the 38th anniversary and involves all the tourism industry sectors of the 10 member states of ASEAN: Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. It was organized by TTG Events from Singapore.

=== Cooperation funds ===
The establishment of the China-ASEAN Investment Cooperation Fund was announced in 2009 by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao began operations in 2010. The fund, which is sponsored by the Export-Import Bank of China, among other institutional investors, became the first Southeast Asia-focused private equity fund approved by China&#x27;s State Council and the National Development and Reform Commission. The Export-Import Bank of China is the &quot;anchor sponsor&quot; with a &quot;seed investment&quot; of US$300 million. Three other Chinese institutions invested a combined US$500 million. The International Finance Corporation of the World Bank invested US$100 million.

In November 2011, the China-ASEAN Maritime Cooperation fund was established. China underwrote the fund, which is valued at RMB 3 billion.

==Foreign relations==

ASEAN maintains a global network of alliances, dialogue partners and diplomatic missions, and is involved in numerous international affairs. The organisation maintains good relationships on an international scale, particularly towards Asia-Pacific nations, and upholds itself as a neutral party in politics. It holds ASEAN Summits, where heads of government of each member states meet to discuss and resolve regional issues, as well as to conduct other meetings with countries outside the bloc to promote external relations and deal with international affairs. The first summit was held in Bali in 1976. The third summit was in Manila in 1987, and during this meeting, it was decided that the leaders would meet every five years. The fourth meeting was held in Singapore in 1992 where the leaders decided to meet more frequently, every three years. In 2001, it was decided that the organisation will meet annually to address urgent issues affecting the region. In December 2008, the ASEAN Charter came into force and with it, the ASEAN Summit will be held twice a year. The formal summit meets for three days, and usually includes internal organisation meeting, a conference with foreign ministers of the ASEAN Regional Forum, an ASEAN Plus Three meeting and ASEAN-CER, a meeting of member states with Australia and New Zealand.

ASEAN is a major partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, developing cooperation model with the organisation in the field of security, economy, finance, tourism, culture, environmental protection, development and sustainability. Additionally, the grouping has been closely aligned with China, cooperating across numerous areas, including economy, security, education, culture, technology, agriculture, human resource, society, development, investment, energy, transport, public health, tourism, media, environment, and sustainability. It is also the linchpin in the foreign policy of Australia and New Zealand, with the three sides being integrated into an essential alliance.

ASEAN also participates in the East Asia Summit (EAS), a pan-Asian forum held annually by the leaders of eighteen countries in the East Asian region, with ASEAN in a leadership position. Initially, membership included all member states of ASEAN plus China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, and New Zealand, but was expanded to include the United States and Russia at the Sixth EAS in 2011, as they were also important players having dominance and influence over the region. The first summit was held in Kuala Lumpur on 14 December 2005, and subsequent meetings have been held after the annual ASEAN Leaders&#x27; Meeting. The summit has discussed issues including trade, energy, and security and the summit has a role in regional community building.

Other meetings include the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting that focus mostly on specific topics, such as defence or the environment, and are attended by ministers. The (ARF), which met for the first time in 1994, fosters dialogue and consultation, and to promote confidence-building and preventive diplomacy in the region. As of July 2007, it consists of twenty-seven participants that include all ASEAN member states, Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, China, the EU, India, Japan, North and South Korea, Mongolia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Russia, Timor-Leste, the United States, and Sri Lanka. Taiwan has been excluded since the establishment of the ARF, and issues regarding the Taiwan Strait are neither discussed at ARF meetings nor stated in the ARF Chairman&#x27;s Statements.

ASEAN also holds meetings with Europe during the Asia–Europe Meeting (ASEM), an informal dialogue process initiated in 1996 with the intention of strengthening co-operation between the countries of Europe and Asia, especially members of the European Union and ASEAN in particular. ASEAN, represented by its secretariat, is one of the forty-five ASEM partners. It also appoints a representative to sit on the governing board of Asia-Europe Foundation (ASEF), a socio-cultural organisation associated with the meeting. Annual bilateral meetings between ASEAN and India, Russia and the United States are also held.

Prior to 2012, ASEAN foreign ministerial statements were not typically contentious. Particularly as international disagreements over the South China Sea increased, the wording of ASEAN foreign ministerial statements became more politically contended.

Following the 2022 visit by United States Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, ASEAN and individual member states reiterated their support of the One China policy.

On 12 November 2022, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged ASEAN countries to abandon their neutrality and condemn Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.

===Territorial disputes===

====South China Sea====
With perceptions that there have been multiple incursions into the South China Sea by the PRC (China) and ROC (Taiwan), with land, islands and resources all having had previous overlapping claims between Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, and various other countries, the PRC and ROC&#x27;s claim into the region is seen as intrusive by many Southeast Asian countries as of 2022, potentially a reflection of the threat of Chinese expansionism into the region.

Shortly after the conclusion of the South China Sea Arbitration, at the 24 July 2016 China-ASEAN Foreign Ministers summit, China assured ASEAN that it would not conduct land reclamation on the Scarborough Shoal. The joint statement at the conclusion of the summit emphasized the implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and urged the parties to refrain from inhabiting currently unoccupied islands, reefs, shoals, cays, and other features.

Within ASEAN, Cambodia is often supportive of the PRC&#x27;s positions, including on the South China Sea issue.

====Bilateral====
There have been territorial disputes between ASEAN member states such as the Cambodian–Thai border dispute between Cambodia and Thailand, Cambodian–Vietnamese border dispute between Cambodia and Vietnam, and the North Borneo dispute between the Philippines and Malaysia. The Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1978, backed by the Soviet Union, was not accepted by ASEAN. They rejected it as a violation of the principles of regional integration. ASEAN cooperated with US and Australia to oppose Vietnam&#x27;s move and it sponsored a Cambodian resolution in the United Nations General Assembly. ASEAN played a major role starting in 1980 in the peace process, leading to the 1991 Paris Agreement.

===Relations with other blocs===
====ASEAN Plus Three====
In 1990, Malaysia proposed the creation of an East Asia Economic Caucus composed of the members of ASEAN, China, Japan, and South Korea. It intended to counterbalance the growing US influence in Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and Asia as a whole. However, the proposal failed because of strong opposition from the US and Japan. Work for further integration continued, and the ASEAN Plus Three, consisting of ASEAN, China, Japan, and South Korea, was created in 1997.

ASEAN Plus Three is a forum that functions as a coordinator of co-operation between the ASEAN and the three East Asian nations of China, South Korea, and Japan. Government leaders, ministers, and senior officials from the ten members of the ASEAN and the three East Asian states consult on an increasing range of issues. The ASEAN Plus Three is the latest development of Southeast Asia-East Asia regional co-operation. In the past, proposals, such as South Korea&#x27;s call for an Asian Common Market in 1970 and Japan&#x27;s 1988 suggestion for an Asian Network, have been made to bring closer regional co-operation.

The first leaders&#x27; meetings were held in 1996, and 1997 to deal with Asia–Europe Meeting issues, and China and Japan each wanted regular summit meetings with ASEAN members afterwards. The group&#x27;s significance and importance were strengthened by the Asian Financial Crisis. In response to the crisis, ASEAN closely cooperated with China, South Korea, and Japan. Since the implementation of the Joint Statement on East Asia Cooperation in 1999 at the Manila Summit, ASEAN Plus Three finance ministers have been holding periodic consultations. ASEAN Plus Three, in establishing the Chiang Mai Initiative, has been credited as forming the basis for financial stability in Asia, the lack of such stability having contributed to the Asian Financial Crisis.

Since the process began in 1997, ASEAN Plus Three has also focused on subjects other than finance such as the areas of food and energy security, financial co-operation, trade facilitation, disaster management, people-to-people contacts, narrowing the development gap, rural development, and poverty alleviation, human trafficking, labour movement, communicable diseases, environment and sustainable development, and transnational crime, including counter-terrorism. With the aim of further strengthening the nations&#x27; co-operation, East Asia Vision Group (EAVG) II was established at the 13th ASEAN Plus Three Summit on 29 October 2010 in Hanoi to stock-take, review, and identify the future direction of the co-operation.

The ASEAN Plus Three framework also serves as a platform for the ASEAN affiliated intergovernmental organizations in China, Korea, and Japan to meet and cooperate. The ASEAN-China Centre, the ASEAN-Japan Centre, and ASEAN-Korea Centre currently convene annually to discuss ongoing projects and to discuss possible areas of cooperation vis-a-vis ASEAN.

====ASEAN Plus Six====
ASEAN Plus Three was the first of attempts for further integration to improve existing ties of Southeast Asia with East Asian countries of China, Japan and South Korea. This was followed by the even larger East Asia Summit (EAS), which included ASEAN Plus Three as well as India, Australia, and New Zealand. This group acted as a prerequisite for the planned East Asia Community which was supposedly patterned after the European Community (now transformed into the European Union). The ASEAN Eminent Persons Group was created to study this policy&#x27;s possible successes and failures.

The group became ASEAN Plus Six with Australia, New Zealand, and India, and stands as the linchpin of Asia Pacific&#x27;s economic, political, security, socio-cultural architecture, as well as the global economy. Codification of the relations between these countries has seen progress through the development of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a free-trade agreement involving the 15 countries of ASEAN Plus Six (excluding India). RCEP would, in part, allow the members to protect local sectors and give more time to comply with the aim for developed country members.

India temporarily does not join the RCEP for the protection of its own market, but Japan, China, and ASEAN welcomes India&#x27;s participation.

Taiwan has been excluded from participating with the organization owing to China&#x27;s influence on the Asia Pacific through its economic and diplomatic influence.

==Environment==
At the turn of the 21st century, ASEAN began to discuss environmental agreements. These included the signing of the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution in 2002 as an attempt to control haze pollution in Southeast Asia, arguably the region&#x27;s most high-profile environmental issue. Unfortunately, this was unsuccessful due to the outbreaks of haze in 2005, 2006, 2009, 2013, and 2015.
As of 2015, thirteen years after signing the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution, the situation with respect to the long term issue of Southeast Asian haze had not changed for 50% of the ASEAN member states, and still remained as a crisis every two years during summer and fall.

Trash dumping from foreign countries (such as Japan and Canada) to ASEAN has yet to be discussed and resolved. Important issues include deforestation (with Indonesia recorded the largest loss of forest in the region, more than other member states combined in the 2001–2013 period), plastic waste dumping (5 member states were among the top 10 out of 192 countries based on 2010 data, with Indonesia ranked as second worst polluter), threatened mammal species (Indonesia ranked the worst in the region with 184 species under threat), threatened fish species (Indonesia ranked the worst in the region), threatened (higher) plant species (Malaysia ranked the worst in the region).

ASEAN&#x27;s aggregate economy is one of the fastest growing in the world. It is expected to grow by 4.6% in 2019, and 4.8% in 2020, but at the cost of the release about 1.5 billion tonnes of CO2 to the atmosphere every year. That makes ASEAN a greater source of greenhouse gas emissions than Japan (1.3 billion tonnes per year) or Germany (796 million tonnes per year). It is the only region in the world where coal is expected to increase its share of the energy mix. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), &quot;Since 2000 [ASEAN&#x27;s] overall energy demand has grown by more than 80% and the lion&#x27;s share of this growth has been met by a doubling in fossil fuel use... Oil is the largest element in the regional energy mix and coal, largely for power generation, has been the fastest growing.&quot; ASEAN has been criticized for not doing enough to mitigate climate change although it is the world&#x27;s most vulnerable region in terms of climate impact.

ASEAN has many opportunities for renewable energy. With solar and wind power plus off river pumped hydro storage, ASEAN electricity industry could achieve very high penetration (78%–97%) of domestic solar and wind energy resources at a competitive levelised costs of electricity range from 55 to 115 U.S. dollars per megawatt-hour based on 2020 technology costs. Vietnam&#x27;s experience in solar and wind power development provides relevant implications for the other ASEAN countries. The proposed ASEAN Power Grid could allow for renewable energy transmission from large producers like Vietnam to others within ASEAN.

=== Energy transition ===

The ASEAN has initiated its transition to cleaner energy sources. This transition is characterized as Demanding, Doable, and Dependent. With approximately 679 million inhabitants, the region is witnessing a substantial surge in energy demand, projected to triple by 2050. However, transitioning energy sources requires significant resources. Southeast Asia would need to invest US$27 billion annually in renewable energy to achieve the target of 23% renewables in the primary energy supply by 2025. Nevertheless, this goal is attainable with the implementation of appropriate policies.

Vietnam serves as a compelling example of rapid adoption of solar and wind energy. Since 2019, Vietnam has emerged as a regional leader, with solar and wind energy accounting for 13% of its electricity mix in 2022, a remarkable increase from nearly zero in 2017. Though, the region requires international assistance to meet its net-zero emission targets. Phasing out coal remains a daunting task, although countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam have pledged to phasing out coal power by 2040s. Several high-profile leaders such as the head of the Indonesian national energy company PLN, Darmawan Prasodjo, have stated that the ASEAN Power Grid proposal is key to unlocking the potential for green energy in southeast Asia.

==Education==
To enhance the region&#x27;s status in education, ASEAN education ministers have agreed four priorities for education at all levels, promoting ASEAN awareness among ASEAN citizens, particularly youth, strengthening ASEAN identity through education, building ASEAN human resources in the field of education strengthening the ASEAN University Network. At the 11th ASEAN Summit in December 2005, leaders set new direction for regional education collaboration when they welcomed the decision of the ASEAN education ministers to convene meetings on a regular basis. The annual ASEAN Education Ministers Meeting oversees co-operation efforts on education at the ministerial level. With regard to implementation, programs, and activities are carried out by the ASEAN Senior Officials on Education (SOM-ED). SOM-ED also manages co-operation on higher education through the ASEAN University Network (AUN). It is a consortium of Southeast Asian tertiary institutions of which 30 currently belong as participating universities. Founded in November 1995 by 11 universities, the AUN was established to: promote co-operation among ASEAN scholars, academics, and scientists, develop academic and professional human resources, promote information dissemination among the ASEAN academic community, enhance awareness of a regional identity and the sense of &quot;ASEAN-ness&quot; among member states.

In November 2011, ten vocational schools and centers were established in China to help develop human resources to assist in the economic and social development of the ASEAN countries.

ASEAN also has a scholarship program offered by Singapore to the 9 other member states for secondary school, junior college, and university education. It covers accommodation, food, medical benefits and accident insurance, school fees, and examination fees. Its recipients, who perform well on the GCE Advanced Level Examination, may apply for ASEAN undergraduate scholarships, which are tailored specifically to undergraduate institutions in Singapore and other ASEAN member countries.

&#x27;Australia for ASEAN&#x27; scholarships are also offered by the Australian Government to the &#x27;next generation of leaders&#x27; from ASEAN member states. By undertaking a Master&#x27;s degree, recipients are to develop the skills and knowledge to drive change, help build links with Australia, and also participate in the Indo-Pacific Emerging Leaders Program to help develop the ASEAN Outlook for the Indo-Pacific. Each ASEAN member state is able to receive ten &#x27;Australia for ASEAN&#x27; scholarships.

==Culture==
The organization hosts cultural activities in an attempt to further integrate the region. These include sports and educational activities as well as writing awards. Examples of these include the ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity, ASEAN Heritage Parks and the ASEAN Outstanding Scientist and Technologist Award. In addition, the ASEAN region has been recognized as one of the world&#x27;s most diverse regions ethnically, religiously and linguistically.

===Media===
Member states have promoted co-operation in information to help build an ASEAN identity. One of the main bodies in ASEAN co-operation in information is the ASEAN Committee on Culture and Information (COCI). Established in 1978, its mission is to promote effective co-operation in the fields of information, as well as culture, through its various projects and activities. It includes representatives from national institutions like the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministries of Culture and Information, national radio and television networks, museums, archives and libraries, among others. Together, they meet once a year to formulate and agree on projects to fulfil their mission. On 14 November 2014, foreign ministers of member states launched the ASEAN Communication Master Plan (ACPM). It provides a framework for communicating the character, structure, and overall vision of ASEAN and the ASEAN community to key audiences within the region and globally.

ASEAN Media Cooperation (AMC) sets digital television standards and policies in preparation for broadcasters to transition from analogue to digital broadcasting. This collaboration was conceptualised during the 11th ASEAN Ministers Responsible for Information (AMRI) Conference in Malaysia on 1 March 2012 where a consensus declared that both new and traditional media were keys to connecting ASEAN peoples and bridging cultural gaps in the region. Several key initiatives under the AMC include:
* The ASEAN Media Portal was launched 16 November 2007. The portal aims to provide a one-stop site that contains documentaries, games, music videos, and multimedia clips on the culture, arts, and heritage of the ASEAN countries to showcase ASEAN culture and the capabilities of its media industry.
* The ASEAN NewsMaker Project, an initiative launched in 2009, trains students and teachers to produce informational video clips about their countries. The project was initiated by Singapore. Students trained in NewsMaker software, video production, together with developing narrative storytelling skills. Dr Soeung Rathchavy, Deputy Secretary-General of ASEAN for ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community noted that: &quot;Raising ASEAN awareness amongst the youth is part and parcel of our efforts to build the ASEAN Community by 2015. Using ICT and the media, our youths in the region will get to know ASEAN better, deepening their understanding and appreciation of the cultures, social traditions and values in ASEAN.&quot;
* The ASEAN Digital Broadcasting Meeting, is an annual forum for ASEAN members to set digital television (DTV) standards and policies, and to discuss progress in the implementation of the blueprint from analogue to digital TV broadcasting by 2020. During the 11th ASEAN Digital Broadcasting Meeting members updated the status on DTV implementation and agreed to inform ASEAN members on the &quot;Guidelines for ASEAN Digital Switchover&quot;. An issue was raised around the availability and affordability of set-top boxes (STB), thus ASEAN members were asked to make policies to determine funding for STBs, methods of allocation, subsidies and rebates, and other methods for the allocation of STBs. It was also agreed in the meeting to form a task force to develop STB specifications for DVB-T2 to ensure efficiency.
*The ASEAN Post was launched on 8 August 2017 to commemorate ASEAN&#x27;s 50th Anniversary. It is an independent regional digital media company that is headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It was founded by former investment banker Rohan Ramakrishnan.

===Music===
Music plays a significant role in ASEAN affairs, as evidenced by the new music composed for, and to be performed at, the 34th ASEAN Summit in Bangkok in June 2019.

Since ASEAN&#x27;s founding, a number of songs have been written for the regional alliance:

* &quot;The ASEAN Way&quot;, the official regional anthem of ASEAN. Music by Kittikhun Sodprasert and Sampow Triudom; lyrics by Payom Valaiphatchra.

==Global influence and reception==
ASEAN has been credited by many as among the world&#x27;s most influential organisations and a global powerhouse. The organisation plays a prominent role in regional and international diplomacy, politics, security, economy and trade. The ASEAN Free Trade Area also stands as one of the largest and most important free trade areas in the world, and together with its network of dialogue partners, drove some of the world&#x27;s largest multilateral forums and blocs, including APEC, EAS and RCEP. Being one of the world&#x27;s forefront political, economic and security meetings, the ASEAN Summit serves as a prominent regional (Asia) and international (worldwide) conference, with world leaders attending its related summits and meetings to discuss about various problems and global issues, strengthening cooperation, and making decisions.

Critics have charged ASEAN with weakly promoting human rights and democracy, particularly in junta-led Myanmar. Some scholars think that non-interference has hindered ASEAN efforts to handle the Myanmar issue, human rights abuse, and haze pollution in the area. Despite global outrage at the military crack-down on unarmed protesters in Yangon, ASEAN has refused to suspend Myanmar as a member and also rejects proposals for economic sanctions. This has caused concern as the European Union has refused to conduct free trade negotiations at a regional level for these political reasons. During a UN vote against the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya, most member states voted to either abstain or against the condemnation. Only the Muslim-majority countries Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei voted to condemn the cleansing of Rohingya. Some international observers view ASEAN as a &quot;talk shop&quot;, stating that the organisation is: &quot;big on words, but small on action&quot;. &quot;ASEAN policies have proven to be mostly rhetoric, rather than actual implementation&quot;, according to Pokpong Lawansiri, a Bangkok-based independent analyst of ASEAN. &quot;It has been noted that less than 50% of ASEAN agreements are actually implemented, while ASEAN holds more than six hundred meetings annually&quot;.

The head of the International Institute of Strategic Studies, Tim Huxley, cites the diverse political systems present in the grouping, including many young states, as a barrier to far-reaching co-operation beyond economics. He also asserts that, without an external threat to rally against after the Cold War ended, ASEAN has less successfully restrained its members and resolved such border disputes as those between Myanmar and Thailand or Indonesia and Malaysia. During the 12th ASEAN Summit in Cebu, several activist groups staged anti-globalisation protests, arguing that the agenda of economic integration would negatively affect industries in the Philippines and would deprive thousands of Filipinos of their jobs.

Corruption remains a widespread issue, as &quot;tea money&quot; remains an important requirement to grease business transactions and to receive public services. Following the release of the &quot;Corruption Perceptions Index 2015&quot; by Berlin-based graft watchdog Transparency International on 27 January, its Asia Pacific director, Srirak Plipat, noted that: &quot;if there was one common challenge to unite the Asia-Pacific region, it would be corruption&quot;, noting that: &quot;from campaign pledges to media coverage to civil society forums, corruption dominates the discussion. Yet despite all this talk, there&#x27;s little sign of action.&quot;

===Economic integration===
The group&#x27;s integration plan has raised concerns, in particular, the 2015 deadline. Business and economy experts who attended the Lippo-UPH Dialogue in Naypyidaw cited unresolved issues relating to aviation, agriculture, and human resources. Some panelists, among them, Kishore Mahbubani, warned against high expectations at the onset. He stated: &quot;Please do not expect a big bang event in 2015 where everything is going to happen overnight when the ASEAN Economic Community comes into being. We&#x27;ve made progress in some areas and unfortunately regressed in some areas.&quot;

Some panelists enumerated other matters to be dealt with for a successful launch. Among them were the communications issues involving the 600 million citizens living in the region, increasing understanding in business, current visa arrangements, demand for specific skills, banking connections, and economic differences. Former Philippine National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) Secretary General Romulo A. Virola, said in 2012 that the Philippines seems unready to benefit from the integration due to its &quot;wobbly&quot; economic performance compared to other member states. According to Virola, the Philippines continues to lag behind in terms of employment rate, tourism, life expectancy, and cellular subscriptions. Nestor Tan, head of BDO Unibank Inc., said that while some businesses see the Asian Economic Blueprint (AEC) as an opportunity, the integration would be more of a threat to local firms. Tan added that protecting the Philippines&#x27; agricultural and financial services sectors, as well as the labour sector, would be necessary for the implementation of AEC by 2015. Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s also believed that banks in the Philippines are not yet prepared for the tougher competition that would result from the integration. In one of its latest publications, S&amp;P said banks in the country, although profitable and stable, operate on a much smaller scale than their counterparts in the region.

The US Chamber of Commerce has highlighted widespread concern that the much-anticipated AEC could not be launched by the 2015 deadline. In January 2014, former ASEAN Secretary-General Rodolfo C. Severino, wrote: &quot;while ASEAN should not be condemned for its members&#x27; failure to make good on their commitments, any failure to deliver will likely lead to a loss of credibility and could mean that member states fall further behind in the global competition for export markets and foreign direct investment (FDI)&quot;. In 2012, the commencement of the AEC was postponed to 31 December 2015 from the original plan of 1 January. Despite Secretary-General Surin Pitsuwan&#x27;s firm reassurance that &quot;[t]here will be no more delays and that all ten ASEAN countries will participate&quot;, even the most fervent proponents of AEC worried that AEC would not be delivered on time as December 2015 neared.

An article published by &quot;Vietnam News&quot; echoed some of the challenges and opportunities that Vietnam faces in preparation for the AEC. The article said that the deputy head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Tran Thanh Hai, was concerned about local enterprises&#x27; lack of knowledge of the AEC. It was said that 80% of local enterprises surveyed acknowledged that they have little information about the interests and challenges available for them in the ASEAN market. The article also noted that the general secretary of the Vietnam Steel Association, Chu Duc Khai, said that most of the local steel making enterprises lack information about doing business in the ASEAN market; they have not had a chance to study it, and have only exported small amounts of steel to ASEAN countries. Another challenge is the need to compete with other countries in the ASEAN market to export raw products since the country had mainly exported raw products. The Asian Development Bank also has doubts about Cambodia&#x27;s ability to meet the AEC deadline. The leading economist of ADB, Jayant Menon, said that Cambodia needs to speed up its customs reform and to press ahead with automating processes to reduce trade costs and minimise the opportunities for corruption and be ready for the implementation of its National Single Window by 2015.

Despite an ASEAN Economic Community goal of significant economic integration as laid out in the AEC Blueprint 2025, ASEAN continues to face challenges towards integration. A report published by the Asian Trade Centre in 2019 identified multiple sectors that face challenges towards integration due to non-tariff barriers that still exist in the region. The report stated that the goals of the AEC 2025 would not be accomplished if ASEAN fails to address the issues of non-tariff measures and eliminate non-tariff barriers in the region.

==Security==
ASEAN is recognized by its members to be one of the main forums to discuss security issues; based on the principles in its charter, its main aim is to provide an environment of common understanding and cooperation between the member states to &quot;respond effectively to all forms of threats, transitional crimes and transboundary challenges&quot;. Accordingly, ASEAN has embraced the idea of cooperative security which means that ASEAN&#x27;s approach to security issues is through confidence-building measures and transparency for reducing the tension and conflict between its members. Security policies and plans are concerted by the ASEAN Political-Security Community to envision &quot;a concert of Southeast Asian nations, outward looking, living in peace, stability and prosperity, bonded together in partnership in dynamic development and in a community of caring societies.&quot;

===Piracy===
Piracy in the strait of Malacca and in the Sulu and Celebes Sea is one of the main non-traditional security threats for the region, it has challenged the capacity of its members to ensure coordination of effective policy actions to reduce this phenomenon. As highlighted by the ReCAAP report of 2020: &quot;The increase of incidents (in Asia) during January–June 2020 occurred in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, South China Sea and Singapore Strait.&quot; The increment of incidents during 2020, have raised alerts in the region as the phenomenon of piracy could be fostered by the social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, in their Fourteenth Asean Ministerial Meeting On Transnational Crime the ministers agreed that ASEAN should embrace a greater commitment to strengthen the measures in combating transnational crime in the context of the pandemic. Despite this statement, ASEAN has not updated their plans for combating piracy, although member states created and enforced the Maritime Security Plan of Action 2018-2020, to address the national legal enforcement capacities and creating a common protocol of action to counter piracy allowing the region to cooperate for ensuring the security of the Pacific Ocean, new discussions and agendas for new measures has not been enforced yet.

Accordingly, this plan reinforces the necessity to secure the seas due to the importance of this region geographical and economically, its strategic position as the main link between the Indian and the Pacific Ocean and the region serving as the main passage that connects middle east economies and India with China, Japan, South Korea and Australia. This plan is mainly focused in three priorities:

# Shared Awareness and exchange of best practices.
# Confidence building measures based on international and regional legal frameworks, arrangements and cooperation.
# Capacity building and enhancing cooperation of maritime law enforcement agencies in the region.

In this sense, spread all over the countries of Southeast Asia, criminal organizations with complex structures pose a challenge to ASEAN&#x27;s coordination capacity to solve the problem despite the plans created within its institutional framework. Although some measures have been implemented by ASEAN, still the complexity of the problem requires deep solutions of cooperation that might alter the balance of its framework. The maritime security plans for the region are based on the ASEAN idea of political-security community; the two main objectives of the APSC are: &quot;to accelerate the economic growth, social progress and cultural development by promoting an identity of equality and partnership as the main foundations of peace and prosperity&quot;. Additionally, the APSC promotes &quot;regional peace and stability through abiding respect for justice and the rule of law in the relationship among countries of the region and adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter&quot;.  

Nonetheless, the institutional framework and decision-making procedures in ASEAN make difficult to reach agreements on piracy. ASEAN has struggled to deliver a coordinated response to solve this problem in the region mainly by two reasons: the first one, could be related to the focalized nature of the problem in subregions rather than the whole region. Consequently, this focalization generates that the discussions in the main forums (The ASEAN maritime forum (AMF) and Maritime Security Expert Working Group (MSEWG)) have not resulted in actual measures that tackle piracy and involve all member states as major consensus should be reached to enforce them. One example of this, is the possibility discussed by the 10 ASEAN member states to create a joint ASEAN navy in 2015 to carry on operations in one of the piracy hotspots in the region, the strait of Malacca, this proposal ended up being enforced by bilateral/sub-regional efforts rather than in the ASEAN framework (see ReCAAP for further information).  The second one, consensus on non-traditional security issues has been difficult to reach due to contradictory interest between member states, particularly in joint operations between navies and the reach of these joint operations. These issues are generated mainly by unresolved territorial disputes, specially in the maritime domain, at some extent they pose a challenge to ASEAN members in their capacity to cooperate in regards to the maritime security approach.

Consequently, a greater multilateral cooperation has been pushed by the members to solve the piracy challenges on economy, trading and security. Members of the ASEAN, have addressed the necessity for the regional organization to make some concessions and rearrangements to respond to the challenges that non-traditional security (specifically piracy) issues posse to the security of the ASEAN members. Despite the efforts and plans made by the ASEAN, this organization is expected to overcome the image of being regarded solely as a forum to discuss security issues. Two possible solutions has been proposed by some member states for this purpose: 1. Promoting relationships with other major actors regionally to overcome the short-time challenges and 2. Rearrange the institutional framework to &quot;avoid contention and seek cooperation to maximize the aggregate ability in order to benefit from making the sea fulfil its economic, security and other goals&quot;.

=== Future Security Framework ===
In addition to piracy, there are several significant issues facing ASEAN today, including human rights violations, repression, and democratic backsliding. Across the region, various political leaders are known human rights abusers, however there is no proper accountability process, and often human rights violations are sidelined by economic or political interests. Myanmar is in the midst of a devastating civil war, during which the military government that was installed following a coup d’état, has carried out horrendous human rights violations against the Rohingya population.

<text>Georg Simmel (; ; 1 March 1858 – 26 September 1918) was a German sociologist, philosopher, and critic.

Simmel was influential in the field of sociology. Simmel was one of the first generation of German sociologists: his neo-Kantian approach laid the foundations for sociological antipositivism, asking &quot;what is society?&quot;—directly alluding to Kant&#x27;s &quot;what is nature?&quot;—presenting pioneering analyses of social individuality and fragmentation. Simmel discussed social and cultural phenomena in terms of &quot;forms&quot; and &quot;contents&quot; with a transient relationship, wherein form becomes content, and vice versa dependent on context. In this sense, Simmel was a forerunner to structuralist styles of reasoning in the social sciences. 

Through &quot;The Metropolis and Mental Life&quot; Simmel was a precursor of urban sociology, symbolic interactionism, and social network analysis. An acquaintance of Max Weber, Simmel wrote on the topic of personal character in a manner reminiscent of the sociological ideal type. He broadly rejected academic standards, however, philosophically covering topics such as emotion and romantic love. Both Simmel and Weber&#x27;s nonpositivist theory informed the eclectic critical theory of the Frankfurt School.

==Biography==
=== Early life and education ===
Georg Simmel was born in Berlin, Germany, as the youngest of seven children to an assimilated Jewish family. His father, Eduard Simmel (1810–1874), a prosperous businessman and convert to Roman Catholicism, had founded a confectionery store called &quot;Felix &amp; Sarotti&quot; that would later be taken over by a chocolate manufacturer. His mother Flora Bodstein (1818–1897) came from a Jewish family who had converted to Lutheranism. Georg, himself, was baptized as a Protestant when he was a child. 
His father died in 1874, when Georg was 16, leaving a sizable inheritance. Georg was then adopted by Julius Friedländer, the founder of an international music publishing house known as Peters Verlag, who endowed him with the large fortune that enabled him to become a scholar.

Beginning in 1876, Simmel studied philosophy and history at the Humboldt University of Berlin, going on to receive his doctorate in 1881 for his thesis on Kantian philosophy of matter, titled &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Nature of Matter According to Kant&#x27;s Physical Monadology&quot;).

In 1885, Simmel became a &quot;privatdozent&quot; at the University of Berlin, officially lecturing in philosophy but also in ethics, logic, pessimism, art, psychology and sociology. His lectures were not only popular inside the university, but attracted the intellectual elite of Berlin as well. Although his applications for vacant chairs at German universities were supported by Max Weber, Simmel remained an academic outsider. However, with the support of an inheritance from his guardian, he was able to pursue his scholarly interests for many years without needing a salaried position.

Simmel had a hard time gaining acceptance in the academic community despite the support of well known associates, such as Max Weber, Rainer Maria Rilke, Stefan George and Edmund Husserl. This was partly because he was seen as a Jew during an era of anti-Semitism, but also simply because his articles were written for a general audience rather than academic sociologists. This led to dismissive judgements from other professionals. Simmel nevertheless continued his intellectual and academic work, as well as taking part in artistic circles.

===Later life===

In 1890, Georg married Gertrud Kinel, a philosopher who published under the pseudonym Marie-Luise Enckendorf, and under her own name. They lived a sheltered and bourgeois life, their home becoming a venue for cultivated gatherings in the tradition of the salon. They had one son, Hans Eugen Simmel, who became a medical doctor. Georg and Gertrud&#x27;s granddaughter was the psychologist Marianne Simmel. Simmel also had a secret affair with his assistant Gertrud Kantorowicz, who bore him a daughter in 1907, though this fact was hidden until after Simmel&#x27;s death.

In 1909, Simmel, Ferdinand Tönnies, Max Weber, and others, co-founded the German Society for Sociology. He served as a member of its first executive body. In 1914, Simmel received an ordinary professorship with chair, at the then German University of Strassburg, but did not feel at home there. Because World War I broke out, all academic activities and lectures were halted and lecture halls were converted to military hospitals. In 1915 he applied – without success – for a chair at the Heidelberg University. In 1917, Simmel stopped reading the newspapers and withdrew to the Black Forest to finish the book &quot;The View of Life&quot; (&quot;Lebensanschauung&quot;). Shortly before the end of the war in 1918, he died from liver cancer in Strasbourg.

==Theory==
There are four basic levels of concern in Simmel&#x27;s work:

# The psychological workings of social life 
# The sociological workings of interpersonal relationships.
# The structure of and changes in &quot;zeitgeist&quot; (i.e. the social and cultural &quot;spirit&quot;) of his time. He would also adopt the principle of &quot;emergentism&quot;, the idea that higher levels of conscious properties emerge from lower levels.
# The nature and inevitable fate of humanity.

===Dialectical method===

A dialectical approach is a multicausal and multidirectional method: it focuses on social relations; integrates facts and value, rejecting the idea that there are hard and fast dividing lines between social phenomena; looks not only at the present, but also at the past and future; and is deeply concerned with both conflicts and contradictions. Simmel&#x27;s sociology was concerned with relationships—especially interaction—and was thus known as a &quot;relationalist&quot;. This approach is based on the idea that interactions exist between everything. Overall, Simmel would be mostly interested in dualisms, conflicts, and contradictions in whatever realm of the social world he happened to be working on.

=== Forms of association ===
The furthest Simmel has brought his work to a micro-level of analysis was in dealing with forms and interactions that takes place with different types of people. Such forms would include &quot;subordination&quot;, &quot;superordination&quot;, &quot;exchange&quot;, &quot;conflict&quot; and &quot;sociability&quot;.

Simmel focused on these forms of association while paying little attention to individual consciousness. Simmel believed in the &quot;creative consciousness&quot; that can be found in diverse forms of interaction, which he observed both the ability of actors to create social structures, as well as the disastrous effects such structures had on the creativity of individuals. Simmel also believed that social and cultural structures come to have a life of their own.

====Sociability====
Simmel refers to &quot;all the forms of association by which a mere sum of separate individuals are made into a &#x27;society&#x27;,&quot; whereby &quot;society&quot; is defined as a &quot;higher unity,&quot; composed of individuals.

Simmel would especially be fascinated by man&#x27;s &quot;impulse to sociability,&quot; whereby &quot;the solitariness of the individuals is resolved into togetherness,&quot; referring to this unity as &quot;the free-playing, interacting interdependence of individuals.&quot; Accordingly, he defines &quot;sociability&quot; as &quot;the play-form of association&quot; driven by &quot;amicability, breeding, cordiality and attractiveness of all kinds.&quot; In order for this free association to occur, Simmel explains, &quot;the personalities must not emphasize themselves too individually...with too much abandon and aggressiveness.&quot; Rather, &quot;this world of sociability...a democracy of equals&quot; is to be without friction so long as people blend together in the spirit of pleasure and bringing &quot;about among themselves a pure interaction free of any disturbing material accent.&quot;

Simmel describes idealised interactions in expressing that &quot;the vitality of real individuals, in their sensitivities and attractions, in the fullness of their impulses and convictions...is but a symbol of life, as it shows itself in the flow of a lightly amusing play,&quot; adding that &quot;a symbolic play, in whose aesthetic charm all the finest and most highly sublimated dynamics of social existence and its riches are gathered.&quot;

===Social geometry===
In a dyad (i.e. a two-person group), a person is able to retain their individuality as there is no fear that another may shift the balance of the group. In contrast, triads (i.e. three-person groups) risk the potential of one member becoming subordinate to the other two, thus threatening their individuality. Furthermore, were a triad to lose a member, it would become a dyad.

The basic nature of this dyad-triad principle forms the essence of structures that form society. As a group (structure) increases in size, it becomes more isolated and segmented, whereby the individual also becomes further separated from each member. In respect to the notion of &quot;group size&quot;, Simmel&#x27;s view was somewhat ambiguous. On one hand, he believed that the individual benefits most when a group gets bigger and exerting control on the individual becomes harder. On the other hand, with a large group there is a possibility of the individual&#x27;s becoming distant and impersonal. Therefore, in an effort for the individual to cope with the larger group they must become a part of a smaller group such as the family.

The value of something is determined by the distance from its actor. In &quot;The Stranger&quot;, Simmel discusses how if a person is too close to the actor they are not considered a stranger. If they are too far, however, they would no longer be a part of a group. The particular distance from a group allows a person to have objective relationships with different group members.

==Views==

===The Metropolis and Mental Life===
One of Simmel&#x27;s most notable essays is &quot;The Metropolis and Mental Life&quot; (&quot;&quot;) from 1903, which was originally given as one of a series of lectures on all aspects of city life by experts in various fields, ranging from science and religion to art. The series was conducted alongside the Dresden cities exhibition of 1903. Simmel was originally asked to lecture on the role of intellectual (or scholarly) life in the big city, but he effectively reversed the topic in order to analyze the effects of the big city on the mind of the individual. As a result, when the lectures were published as essays in a book, to fill the gap, the series editor himself had to supply an essay on the original topic.

&quot;The Metropolis and Mental Life&quot; was not particularly well received during Simmel&#x27;s lifetime. The organisers of the exhibition overemphasised its negative comments about city life, because Simmel also pointed out positive transformations. During the 1920s the essay was influential on the thinking of Robert E. Park and other American sociologists at the University of Chicago who collectively became known as the &quot;Chicago School&quot;. It gained wider circulation in the 1950s when it was translated into English and published as part of Kurt Wolff&#x27;s edited collection, &quot;The Sociology of Georg Simmel&quot;. It now appears regularly on the reading lists of courses in urban studies and architecture history. However, it is important to note that the notion of the blasé is actually not the central or final point of the essay, but is part of a description of a sequence of states in an irreversible transformation of the mind. In other words, Simmel does not quite say that the big city has an overall negative effect on the mind or the self, even as he suggests that it undergoes permanent changes. It is perhaps this ambiguity that gave the essay a lasting place in the discourse on the metropolis.

===&quot;The Philosophy of Money&quot;===
In &quot;The Philosophy of Money&quot;, Simmel views money as a component of life which helped us understand the totality of life. Simmel believed people created value by making objects, then separating themselves from that object and then trying to overcome that distance. He found that things which were too close were not considered valuable and things which were too far for people to get were also not considered valuable. Considered in determining value was the scarcity, time, sacrifice, and difficulties involved in getting the object.

For Simmel, city life led to a division of labor and increased financialisation. As financial transactions increase, some emphasis shifts to what the individual can do, instead of who the individual is. Financial matters in addition to emotions are in play.

===&quot;The Stranger&quot;===
Simmel&#x27;s concept of distance comes into play where he identifies a stranger as a person that is far away and close at the same time.
A stranger is far enough away that he is unknown but close enough that it is possible to get to know him. In a society there must be a stranger. If everyone is known then there is no person that is able to bring something new to everybody.

The stranger bears a certain objectivity that makes him a valuable member to the individual and society. People let down their inhibitions around him and confess openly without any fear. This is because there is a belief that the Stranger is not connected to anyone significant and therefore does not pose a threat to the confessor&#x27;s life.

More generally, Simmel observes that because of their peculiar position in the group, strangers often carry out special tasks that the other members of the group are either incapable or unwilling to carry out. For example, especially in pre-modern societies, most strangers made a living from trade, which was often viewed as an unpleasant activity by &quot;native&quot; members of those societies. In some societies, they were also employed as arbitrators and judges, because they were expected to treat rival factions in society with an impartial attitude.

On one hand the stranger&#x27;s opinion does not really matter because of his lack of connection to society, but on the other the stranger&#x27;s opinion does matter, because of his lack of connection to society. He holds a certain objectivity that allows him to be unbiased and decide freely without fear. He is simply able to see, think, and decide without being influenced by the opinion of others.

===On secrecy===
According to Simmel, in small groups, secrets are less needed because everyone seems to be more similar. In larger groups secrets are needed as a result of their heterogeneity. In secret societies, groups are held together by the need to maintain the secret, a condition that also causes tension because the society relies on its sense of secrecy and exclusion.
For Simmel, secrecy exists even in relationships as intimate as marriage.In revealing all, marriage becomes dull and boring and loses all excitement. Simmel saw a general thread in the importance of secrets and the strategic use of ignorance: To be social beings who are able to cope successfully with their social environment, people need clearly defined realms of unknowns for themselves. Furthermore, sharing a common secret produces a strong &quot;we feeling.&quot; The modern world depends on honesty and therefore a lie can be considered more devastating than it ever has been before.
Money allows a level of secrecy that has never been attainable before, because money allows for &quot;invisible&quot; transactions, due to the fact that money is now an integral part of human values and beliefs. It is possible to buy silence.

===On flirtation===
In his multi-layered essay, &quot;Women, Sexuality &amp; Love&quot;, published in 1923, Simmel discusses flirtation as a generalized type of social interaction. According to Simmel, &quot;to define flirtation as simply a &#x27;passion for pleasing&#x27; is to confuse the means to an end with the desire for this end.&quot; The distinctiveness of the flirt lies in the fact that she awakens delight and desire by means of a unique antithesis and synthesis: through the alternation of accommodation and denial. In the behavior of the flirt, the man feels the proximity and interpenetration of the ability and inability to acquire something. This is in essence the &quot;price.&quot; A sidelong glance with the head half-turned is characteristic of flirtation in its most banal guise.

===On fashion===
In the eyes of Simmel, fashion is a form of social relationship that allows those who wish to conform to the demands of a group to do so. It also allows some to be individualistic by deviating from the norm. There are many social roles in fashion and both objective culture and individual culture can have an influence on people. In the initial stage everyone adopts what is fashionable and those that deviate from the fashion inevitably adopt a whole new view of what they consider fashion. Ritzer wrote:
This means that those who are trying to be different or &quot;unique,&quot; are not, because in trying to be different they become a part of a new group that has labeled themselves different or &quot;unique&quot;.

<doc id="106541" wikidata="Q16849558" url="?curid=106541" title="Irimi">
<text>In Japanese martial arts, is the act of entering straight into a technique, as opposed to the more indirect entrance into technique called &quot;tenkan&quot;. In basic training, irimi usually looks like a step forward, straight or at an angle but usually ending with the body facing the attacker, rather than in the direction of the step. To enter with irimi, the defender needs to move in the very moment of the attack or even himself initiate it.

== Aikido ==
Meaning: Entering or putting in the body.

Irimi (ee-ree-mee) is the second pillar of Aikido (Aikido techniques are structured around six main pillars). Irimi involves entering deeply around or behind an attack to defuse or neutralize the attack. The concept of irimi teaches one to blend with or enter into an opponent&#x27;s attack to become one with the opponent&#x27;s movement and leaving the opponent with nowhere to strike. This movement is utilized during the moment of the opponent&#x27;s attack. To complete the movement, one moves out of the opponent&#x27;s line of attack to the opponent&#x27;s shikaku, or blind spot. When executed properly, one can strike an opponent with great force, combining his attacking momentum and one&#x27;s forward movement.

The entering principle is basic to most Aikido movements as the postures and movements in Aikido contain quite a few oblique stances which are adapted from Sōjutsu (spear fighting).

In Aikido, there are numerous examples of techniques exhibiting the concepts of yin and yang. Irimi and tenkan are an example. Tenkan is the motion of turning (yin) and irimi is the motion of entering (yang).

Irimi is one of two motions Aikido students perform in the role of nage. Practicing irimi will help the Aikido student develop Hara, balance, and groundedness.

In Yoshinkan aikido irimi techniques are denoted by the number one (and tenkan as two).
In modern aikikai irimi techniques are referred to as omote (and tenkan as ura).

<doc id="106542" wikidata="Q7699900" url="?curid=106542" title="Tenkan">
<text>is the Japanese name of a movement practiced in several martial arts. It is a 180 degree pivot to the rear, on the lead foot. That is, if the left foot is forward, the pivot is clockwise, and if the right foot is forward, the pivot is counter-clockwise.

==Aikido==
Tenkan is a very common foot move in aikido. Strategically, tenkan is most often used to place &quot;tori&quot; back-to-back with &quot;uke&quot;. A few attacks - techniques that commonly begin by executing tenkan include: &quot;shōmen&#x27;uchi&quot; - &quot;kaitennage&quot;; &quot;katate-dori&quot; - &quot;shihōnage&quot;; and &quot;morote-dori&quot; - &quot;kokyūnage&quot;.

Some styles of aikido practice six basic &quot;ashi sabaki&quot; (stepping/footwork) movements, of which tenkan is one.

Those six basic stepping techniques are:

*Tsugi-ashi (shuffle step)
*Ayumi-ashi (crossing step)
*Kaiten (hip shift to avoid attack)
*Tenshin (step and pivot to avoid attack)
*Tenkan (180 degree pivot to avoid attack)
*Ude-furi (spin step)

==Judo==
Tenkan is a foot move used in judo.

<doc id="106544" wikidata="Q1004875" url="?curid=106544" title="Bumiputera (Malaysia)">
<text>Bumiputera or bumiputra (Jawi: , Native) is a term used in Malaysia to describe Malays, the Orang Asli of Peninsular Malaysia, various indigenous peoples of East Malaysia, and Peranakans.

The term is derived from the Sanskrit language which was later absorbed into the classical Malay word (). This can be translated literally as &quot;son of the land&quot; or &quot;son of the soil&quot;. In Indonesia, this term is known as &quot;Pribumi&quot;; the latter is also used in Malaysia but in a more generic sense to mean &quot;indigenous peoples&quot;.

In the 1970s, the Malaysian government implemented policies designed to favour bumiputera (including affirmative action in public education and in the public sector) in order to elevate the socioeconomic status of the economically disadvantaged bumiputera community. It was an effort to defuse interethnic tensions following the 13 May Incident in 1969 and to placate the Malay majority through granting them a privileged status over Malaysian Chinese and Indians. Originally intended as a temporary measure, these policies are still in effect. They have been described as racially discriminatory. Although the policies have succeeded in creating a significant urban Malay and Native Bornean middle class, they have been less effective in eradicating poverty among rural communities.

==Official definition==
The concept of a bumiputera ethnic group in Malaysia was coined by Abdul Razak Hussein. It recognised the &quot;special position&quot; of the Malays provided in the Constitution of Malaysia, in particular Article 153. However, the constitution does not use the term bumiputera; it defines only &quot;Malay&quot; and &quot;aboriginal peoples&quot; (Article 160(2)), &quot;natives&quot; of Sarawak (161A(6)(a)), and &quot;natives&quot; of Sabah (Article 161A(6) (b)). Definitions of bumiputera in public use vary among different institutions, organisations, and government departments and agencies.

In the parliamentary debate of 13 November 1965, the Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, was asked by Lim Chong Eu if there is a &quot;legal and constitutional definition of the term &quot;Bumiputera&quot;, and whether the children of Malaysian citizens who were born after 31 August 1963, will also be entitled to all the rights of &quot;Bumiputera&quot;. To this, Tunku replied: &quot;Mr Speaker, Sir, the term &#x27;Bumiputera&#x27;...has no legal meaning except in so far as to denote the natives of the mainland of Malaya and the natives of the Borneo States&quot;. He later qualified that the benefits under Article 153 were for &quot;the natives of Malaysia…who are less advanced and less able to compete with these other Malaysians&quot;.

In the book &quot;Buku Panduan Kemasukan ke Institusi Pengajian Tinggi Awam, Program Pengajian Lepasan SPM/Setaraf Sesi Akademik 2007/2008&quot; (Guidebook for entry into public higher learning institutions for SPM/equivalent graduates for academic year 2007/2008), the Malaysian Higher Education Ministry defined bumiputra as follows, depending on the region of origin of the individual applicant:

# Peninsular Malaysia
#* &quot;If one of the parents is Muslim Malay/Orang Asli as stated in Article 160 (2) Federal Constitution of Malaysia; thus the child is considered as a Bumiputera&quot;
# Sabah
#* &quot;If the child was born in Sabah or the father was domiciled in Sabah at the time of birth, and one of the parents is an indigenous native of Sabah as stated in Article 161A (6)(b) Federal Constitution of Malaysia, the child is considered as a Bumiputera&quot;
# Sarawak
#* &quot;If both of the parents are indigenous natives of Sarawak as stated in Article 161A (6)(a) Federal Constitution of Malaysia; thus their child is considered as a Bumiputera&quot;

In addition to the interpretation given above, a broader definition of bumiputera include groups such as native Indonesians, Malaysian Siamese, Muslim Indian Malaysians, Peranakan and the Kristang people of Portuguese-Eurasian descent. Most of these encompass communities that were established in southeast Asia prior to the period of British colonial rule which saw large-scale immigration from China. Others favour a definition encompassing all children of bumiputera. 

In Sarawak, there were cases of people with one bumiputera parent and one non-bumiputera parent being dismissed as non-bumiputera. However, this law was changed in 2022.

==History==
At the time of Malaya&#x27;s independence from British colonial rule in 1957, the population included many first- or second-generation immigrants who had come to fill manpower needs as indentured labourers, among rich Chinese merchants and settlers who brought their wealth and investment into Malaysia.

Chinese immigrants, who typically settled in urban areas, played a significant role in the commercial sector after the Indians left the country to return to India, much of the commercial sector was taken over by wealthy Chinese merchants. The Communities Liaison Committee (CLC), comprising leading politicians from different racial backgrounds, supported the promotion of economic equality for the Malays, conditional on political equality for the non-Malays. CLC member E.E.C. Thuraisingham later said, &quot;I and others believed that the backward Malays should be given a better deal. Malays should be assisted to attain parity with non-Malays to forge a united Malayan Nation of equals.&quot;

Article 153 of the Constitution states that,

Article 160 defines a Malay as being one who &quot;professes the religion of Islam, habitually speaks the Malay language, conforms to Malay customs and is the child of at least one parent who was born within the Federation of Malaysia before independence of Malaya on 31 August 1957, or the issue of such a person.&quot;

Article 8 of the Constitution, states that all Malaysian citizens shall be equal under the law, and &quot;Except as expressly authorised by this Constitution, there shall be no discrimination against citizens on the ground only of religion, race, descent or place of birth in any law or in the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority or in the administration of any law relating to the acquisition, holding or disposition of property or the establishing or carrying on of any trade, business, profession, vocation or employment.&quot; Article 153 itself expressly forbids particular forms of discrimination; clause 5 states that &quot;All persons of whatever race in the same grade in the service of the Federation shall, subject to the terms and conditions of their employment, be treated impartially,&quot; while clause 9 states: &quot;Nothing in this Article shall empower Parliament to restrict business or trade solely for the purpose of reservations for Malays.&quot;

The concept of the bumiputera&#x27;s special position has been disputed. The Reid Commission, which drafted the Constitution, initially proposed that Article 153 expire after 15 years unless renewed by Parliament. This qualification was struck from the final draft. After the 13 May Incident in 1969, representatives within the government argued over whether the special position of the bumiputera should have a sunset clause.

Ismail Abdul Rahman argued that &quot;the question be left to the Malays themselves because ... as more and more Malays became educated and gained self-confidence, they themselves would do away with this &#x27;special position&#x27;.&quot; Ismail believed the special position was &quot;a slur on the ability of the Malays.&quot; In 1970, however, one member of the Cabinet said that Malay special rights would remain for &quot;hundreds of years to come.&quot;

In the 1970s, the government implemented the New Economic Policy (NEP), designed to be a more aggressive form of affirmative action for the bumiputera than Article 153. Article 153 provides specifically for the use of quotas in the granting of scholarships, positions in the civil service, and business licences, as well as native reservations of land. Policies under the rubric of the NEP include subsidies for real estate purchases, quotas for public equity shares, and general subsidies to bumiputera businesses.

Former Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and his predecessor Mahathir Mohamad have both suggested that Malays should depend less on government assistance. Many observers believe full abolition of bumiputera privileges is unlikely, especially in view of the constitutional issues involved, although successive administrations since Mahathir have attempted to reform the system of government aid for the bumiputera. Some bumiputera groups believe further affirmative action is necessary.

Parliament began to use the term &quot;bumiputra&quot; in 1965. Following debate of the act to create the Majlis Amanah Rakyat (MARA), the government founded an agency to preserve bumiputera interests.

In July 2017, Prime Minister Najib Razak said that the government would consider the request of the Muslim Indian community to be recognized as bumiputera, in what is seen as a move to woo voters in the lead-up to the upcoming general election.

==Contentious policy==
Certain but not all pro-bumiputera policies exist as affirmative action for bumiputera, for NEP is racial-based and not deprivation-based. For instance, all bumiputera, regardless of their financial standing, are entitled 7 percent discount on houses or property, including luxurious units; whilst a low-income non-bumiputra receives no such financial assistance. Other preferential policies include quotas for the following: admission to government educational institutions, qualification for public scholarships, marking of universities exam papers, special bumiputera-only classes prior to university&#x27;s end of term exams, for positions in government, and ownership of businesses. Most of the policies were established in the Malaysian New Economic Policy (NEP) period. Many policies focus on trying to achieve a bumiputerashare of corporate equity, comprising at least 30% of the total. Ismail Abdul Rahman proposed this target after the government was unable to agree on a suitable policy goal.

In a report titled 2012 Investment Climate Statement – Malaysia published by the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs (US Department of State), under the heading &quot;Ethnic Preferences&quot;, part of a paragraph describes the reality of the bumiputera policy as follows: &quot;Many of the preference policies are opaque, with details of implementation largely left to the various ministries and civil servants within those ministries. Policies and practices vary greatly. Some practices are explicit and contained in law or regulation, while others are informal, leaving much ambiguity for potential investors. The civil service itself is subject to bumiputera hiring preferences. The NEM [New Economic Model] proposes reforming ethnic preferences in business ownership and social safety net programs. Some conservative bumiputera groups have voiced strong opposition to any significant changes to the extensive preferences.&quot;

Examples of such policies include:
* Companies listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (&quot;Bursa Saham Kuala Lumpur&quot;) used to adhere to a 30% bumiputera ownership of equity to satisfy listing requirements. Foreign companies that operate in Malaysia also had to adhere to this requirement. This policy was canceled in 2009.
* For a limited period, a certain percentage of new housing in any development had to be sold to bumiputera. Housing developers are required to provide a minimum 7% discount to bumiputera buyers of these lots. This is required regardless of the income level of the potential buyer. Remaining unsold houses after a given time period are allowed to be sold to non-bumiputera if the developer proves attempts have been made to fulfil the requirement. There is no bumiputera discount on existing housing.
* A basket of government-run (and profit-guaranteed) mutual funds are available for purchase by bumiputera only. The &quot;Amanah Saham Nasional&quot; (ASN) has return rates approximately 3 to 5 times that of local commercial banks.
* Many government-tendered projects require that companies submitting tenders be bumiputera owned. This requirement has led to non-bumiputera teaming up with bumiputera companies to obtain projects, in a practice known as &quot;Ali Baba&quot;. Ali, the bumiputera, is included solely to satisfy this requirement, and Baba (the non-bumiputera) pays Ali a certain sum in exchange.
* Projects were earmarked for bumiputera contractors to enable them to gain expertise in various fields.
* Approved Permits (APs) for automobiles preferentially allow bumiputera to import vehicles. Automotive companies wishing to bring in cars need to have an AP to do so. APs were originally created to allow bumiputera participation in the automotive industry, since they were issued to companies with at least 70% bumiputera ownership. In 2004, &quot;The Edge&quot; (a business newspaper) estimated that APs were worth approximately RM 35,000 each. They also estimated that the late Nasimuddin Amin, the former chairman of the &quot;Naza&quot; group, received 6,387 in 2003, making him the largest single recipient of APs. More than 12,200 APs were issued in 2003. In addition to APs, foreign car marquees are required to pay between 140% and 300% import duty.

As a result of these policies, many bumiputera with good connections quickly became millionaires. According to Rafidah Aziz, former Minister of Trade and Industry, the policy was to create &quot;Towering Malays&quot;. In 2005 she gave a speech that stated: &quot;If there are young Malay entrepreneurs whose companies are successful, then we appreciate their success, we want Towering Malays of glokal (global and local) standard&quot;. She also said that the policy of Approved Permits (APs) had produced many bumiputera entrepreneurs in the automotive industry.

Since 2000, the government has discussed phasing out certain affirmative action programs and reinstating &quot;meritocracy&quot;. In 2003 it began the system of &quot;Malaysian model meritocracy&quot; for university admission. Admission to public universities was not based upon a common examination such as the SAT or A-Levels, but rather upon a two parallel systems of either a one-year matriculation course or a two-year STPM (Malaysian Higher School Certificate) programme. Bumiputera compose an overwhelming majority of entrants to the matriculation programme. It is a commonly-held belief that the public university entry requirements are easier for matriculation students and disproportionately difficult for STPM students.

Quotas also exist for Public Services Department (JPA) scholarships, full scholarships offered to students to study in leading universities worldwide. These scholarships are given on the basis of SPM (Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia, the equivalent of O-Levels) results, ethnic group, and certain quotas. The JPA scholars are sent to selected pre-university programmes offered by the government – from there, they apply to universities.

==Opposition to the bumiputera policy==

===Early opposition===
In the 1965 session of Parliament, Singapore&#x27;s Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew (who was also a member of that Parliament) questioned the implementation of Malay rights as proposed. Lee asked, &quot;How does the Malay in the &quot;kampung&quot; find his way out into this modernised civil society? By becoming servants of the 0.3 per cent who would have the money to hire them to clean their shoe, open their motorcar doors?&quot; and &quot;How does telling a Malay bus driver that he should support the party of his Malay director (UMNO) and the Chinese bus conductor to join another party of his Chinese director (MCA) – how does that improve the standards of the Malay bus driver and the Chinese bus conductor who are both workers in the same company?&quot;

Lee closed with &quot;Meanwhile, whenever there is a failure of economic, social and educational policies, you come back and say, oh, these wicked Chinese, Indian and others opposing Malay rights. They don&#x27;t oppose Malay rights. They, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens to go up to the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced. That is what must be done, isn&#x27;t it? Not to feed them with this obscurantist doctrine that all they have got to do is to get Malay rights for the few special Malays and their problem has been resolved.&quot;

===Policy apologists and ongoing opposition===
At the 2004 annual general assembly of the United Malays National Organisation, which is the largest member of the governing coalition, deputy chair Badruddin Amiruldin cautioned against questioning the bumiputera&#x27;s special rights, which met with approval from the delegates: &quot;Let no one from the other races ever question the rights of Malays on this land. Don&#x27;t question the religion because this is my right on this land.&quot; In 2004, Mohd. Johari Baharum, parliamentary secretary of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department, stated that the PSD scholarships would remain quota based. He added that there were no plans to convert this to a merit based system, and that the total value of the PSD scholarship since 1996 was 2.4 billion ringgit.

Another controversial aspect is that the Orang Asli of Peninsular Malaysia are not considered bumiputera under the federal constitution. As their settlement predates that of the Malays, it is considered by many, that bumiputera is about the promotion one religion over another, especially since Orang Asli are much worse off than Muslim Malays. Others argue that the Orang Asli are in fact considered bumiputera.

On 1 March 2009, Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat, the spiritual leader of the opposition Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party stated that the term &quot;bumiputera&quot; is racist and the policy prevented other races from receiving government aid. Nik Aziz&#x27;s remarks were made in response to the criticisms and threats made by UMNO against Democratic Action Party&#x27;s Boo Cheng Hau, the opposition leader in Johor when Boo was reported to have compared &quot;bumiputeraism&quot; with state apartheid.

On 1 February 2015, Swiss academic Tariq Ramadan reflected on how non-Muslims have been treated as second class citizens. He stated, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry but some of your fellow citizens in this country who are not Muslims are facing this discrimination, they are facing injustices.&quot;

== Present condition of the bumiputera ==
In 2006, the Minister of Higher Education, Mustapa Mohamad, stated that he wanted public universities to recruit more non-bumiputera academic staff to &quot;strive for world-class institutions&quot;, which may have signaled a move toward less racial discrimination in academia. However this does not affect entry into universities, which is still designed to restrict other races access to higher education in favour of the bumiputera.

The manufacturing sector is exempted from the Foreign Investment Committee (FIC) Guidelines and the mandatory 30% Bumiputera equity and restrictions in market entry have been removed for all (manufacturing) sub-sectors.

==National identification card system and bumiputera==
Malaysia requires citizens to carry a national identification card called MyKad. Smart Cards identify citizens as Muslims or non-Muslims. The national identification card does not specify whether or not the holder is a bumiputera.

The figure is situated on the upper slopes of Whitehorse Hill in the English civil parish of Uffington in Oxfordshire, some east of Swindon, south of the town of Faringdon and a similar distance west of the town of Wantage; or south of Uffington. The hill forms a part of the scarp of the Berkshire Downs and overlooks the Vale of White Horse to the north. The best views of the figure are obtained from the air, or from directly across the Vale, particularly around the villages of Great Coxwell, Longcot, and Fernham.

The Uffington White Horse was created some time between 1380 and 550 , during the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. The site is owned and managed by the National Trust and is a scheduled monument. &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated in 2003 that &quot;for more than 3,000 years, the Uffington White Horse has been jealously guarded as a masterpiece of minimalist art.&quot; The Uffington Horse is by far the oldest of the white horse figures in Britain; the others inspired by it have an entirely different design.

==Origin==

The earliest reference to the site is found in Medieval Welsh literature. The Llyfr Coch Hergest (&quot;Red Book of Hergest&quot;, 1375–1425) states that &quot;Near to the town of Abinton there is a mountain with a figure of a stallion upon it, and it is white. Nothing grows upon it.&quot; Some scholars have compared the figure to the Celtic goddess Epona, or the later Rhiannon of the Mabinogi.

The figure is one of a number in the area that was long thought to have ancient origins. In the 17th century, John Aubrey attributed the figure to Hengist and Horsa. However, Aubrey also ascribed its origins to the British Celts, noting the similarity of the image to those found on native Iron Age coins. Francis Wise would state that the image was created by Alfred the Great to celebrate his victory at the Battle of Edington.

Although the notion of it being a post-Roman creation remained popular, many antiquarians and scholars had noted the design&#x27;s similarity to the Celtic art found on the coins of the local tribes (the Dobunni and Atrebates). Comparative analysis of the design with numismatic and archeological finds was conducted by Stuart Piggott in 1931 and Ann Ross in 1967, with Piggott suggesting circa 100  as a possible date of origin. In 1949, Morris Marple suggested a Bronze Age date, comparing the design to others throughout Europe and North Africa.

Following an excavation in 1990, the figure&#x27;s origin was finally settled with optically stimulated luminescence testing. Simon Palmer and David Miles of the Oxford Archaeological Unit dated silt deposits to the period between 1380 BC and 550 BC, confirming the Uffington White Horse to be Britain&#x27;s oldest chalk figure. The new Bronze Age date would place the figure&#x27;s origin at the same time as Uffington Castle, during a period when the horse was transforming warfare in Britain.

==History==
Until the late 19th century, the horse was scoured every seven years as part of a more general local fair held on the hill. Francis Wise wrote in 1736: &quot;The ceremony of scouring the Horse, from time immemorial, has been solemnized by a numerous concourse of people from all the villages roundabout.&quot; After the work was done a rural festival was held sponsored by the lord of the manor.

During the Second World War the figure, easily recognisable from the air, was covered over with turf and hedge trimmings so that &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; pilots could not use it for navigation during bombing raids. It was uncovered after the war by Welsh archaeology professor William Francis Grimes.
While the horse is annually re-chalked and restored by volunteers, there have been some alterations over the years. In August 2002, the figure was defaced with the addition of a rider and three dogs by members of the &quot;Real Countryside Alliance&quot; (Real CA). The act was denounced by the Countryside Alliance. For a couple of days in May 2003, a temporary hill figure advertisement for the fourth series of Channel 4&#x27;s series &quot;Big Brother&quot; was controversially placed near the figure. In March 2012, as part of a pre-Cheltenham Festival publicity stunt, a bookmaker added a large jockey to the figure. In August 2023, a restoration project was planned by the National Trust and archeologist Adrian Cox to quantify and reverse the gradual shrinking of the horse since the 1980s. In the summer of 2024, Oxford Archaeology, in partnership with the National trust and English Heritage, began the project to restore the horse to its original position and shape with the help of many volunteers.

==Representation and meaning==
It has long been debated whether the chalk figure was intended to represent a horse or some other animal, such as a dog or a sabre-toothed cat. However, it has been called a horse since the 11th century at least. A cartulary of Abingdon Abbey, compiled between 1072 and 1084, refers to &quot;mons albi equi&quot; at Uffington (&quot;the White Horse Hill&quot;).

The horse is thought to represent a tribal symbol, perhaps connected with the builders of Uffington Castle. It is similar to horses depicted on Celtic coinage, the currency of the pre-Romano-British population, and on the Marlborough Bucket (an Iron Age burial bucket found in Marlborough, Wiltshire).

Another theory proposed by University of Southampton archaeologist Joshua Pollard points to the horse&#x27;s alignment with the sun, particularly in midwinter when the sun appears to overtake the horse, to indicate that it was created as a depiction of a &quot;solar horse&quot;, reflecting mythological beliefs that the sun was carried across the sky on a horse or in a chariot.

==Scouring of the White Horse==
The White Horse has been carefully cleared of vegetation from time to time. The figure has remained clear of turf throughout its long existence, except for being covered as a precaution during the Second World War (as it could be used as a visual landmark for navigation by enemy planes). The cleaning process, known as the Scouring of the White Horse, was formerly made the occasion of a festival. Sports of all kinds were held, and keen rivalry was maintained, not only between the inhabitants of the local villages, but between local champions and those from distant parts of England.

The first of such festivals known took place in 1755 and they lasted until 1857, when 30,000 people turned up for the event and were &quot;too rowdy.&quot; &quot;The Scouring of the White Horse&quot;, by Tom Hughes, was published in 1859 as a semi-fictionalised recounting of his visit to the 1857 event. He recounts being told that the local towns had laid claim to a tradition of scouring the White Horse since Saxon times.

The tradition was revived in 2009 by the National Trust, with local volunteers replacing a layer of freshly quarried chalk on the Spring Bank Holiday weekend. Frequent work is required for the figure to remain visible. If regular cleaning is halted, the figure quickly becomes obscured; Periodic scouring continues, on chalking day volunteers with hammers, buckets of chalk, and kneepads kneel and &quot;smash the chalk to a paste, whitening the paths cut in the grass inch by inch.&quot;

==Nearby prehistoric features==
The most significant nearby feature is the Iron Age Uffington Castle, located on higher ground atop a knoll above the White Horse. This hillfort comprises an area of approximately enclosed by a single, well-preserved bank and ditch. Dragon Hill is a natural chalk hill with an artificial flat top, associated in legend with St George.

Whitehorse Hill is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). It is a geological SSSI due to its Pleistocene sediments, and a biological SSSI as it has one of the few remaining unploughed grasslands along the chalk escarpment in Oxfordshire.

To the west are ice-cut terraces known as the &quot;Giant&#x27;s Stair&quot;. Some believe these terraces at the bottom of this valley are the result of medieval farming, or alternatively were used for early farming after being formed by natural processes. The steep sided dry valley below the horse is known as the Manger and legend says that the horse grazes there at night.
The Blowing Stone, a perforated sarsen stone, lies in a garden in Kingston Lisle, away and produces a musical tone when blown through.

Wayland&#x27;s Smithy is a Neolithic long barrow and chamber tomb southwest of the Horse. It lies next to The Ridgeway, an ancient trackway that also runs behind Uffington Castle, and is followed by the Ridgeway National Trail, a long-distance footpath running from Overton Hill, near Avebury, to Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire.

In 2019, a group of workers laying water pipes near Letcombe Bassett unearthed an almost 3,000 year-old settlement that archaeologists believe to belong to the same community involved in the creation of the Uffington White Horse. The find includes tools, animal bones and the remains of 26 people whose skeletons suggest human sacrifice.

==Influence and cultural references==
The horse was a direct influence on much later hill figures of white horses, including Kilburn White Horse (1858) in Yorkshire, Folkestone White Horse (2003) at the Channel Tunnel terminal near Kent, and a white horse cut from heather that existed from 1981 until the mid-1990s in Mossley, Greater Manchester. The first Westbury White Horse, which faced left, is believed to have been inspired by the Uffington horse. The Uffington White Horse has inspired lookalike hill figures, including one facing left in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. Direct replicas of the Uffington horse can be found at Cockington Green Gardens in Australia and Hogansville, Georgia, U.S. Uffington White Horse has inspired two sculptures in Wiltshire, namely Julie Livsey&#x27;s &quot;White Horse Pacified&quot; (1987) in nearby Swindon, a town which was also once considered for a white horse, and Charlotte Moreton&#x27;s &quot;White Horse&quot; (2010) in Solstice Park, Amesbury.

The White Horse is used as a symbol by diverse organisations (mostly with Oxfordshire or Berkshire connections) and appears in numerous works of literature, visual art and music.

===As an emblem===
The White Horse is the emblem of the Vale of White Horse District Council, the Berkshire Yeomanry (an Army Reserve unit based in Windsor), and educational establishments including Faringdon Community College, The Ridgeway School and Sixth Form College in Wroughton, Wiltshire, and The Ridgeway Primary School in Whitley, Berkshire.

===Literature===
Thomas Hughes, the author of &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot;, who was born in the nearby village of Uffington, wrote a book called &quot;The Scouring of the White Horse&quot;. Published in 1859, and described as &quot;a combined travel book and record of regional history in the guise of a novel, sort of&quot;, it recounts the traditional festivities surrounding the periodic renovation of the White Horse. In &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;, written between 1859 and 1885, Tennyson compares King Arthur&#x27;s removal of certain corrupt judges, who had been installed by his predecessor, Uther, to the way in which &quot;Men weed the White Horse on the Berkshire hills, to keep him bright and clean as heretofore.&quot; G.K. Chesterton also features the scouring of the White Horse in his epic poem &quot;The Ballad of the White Horse&quot;, published in 1911, a romanticised depiction of the exploits of King Alfred the Great.

In modern fiction, Rosemary Sutcliff&#x27;s 1977 children&#x27;s book &quot;Sun Horse, Moon Horse&quot; tells a fictional story of the Bronze Age creator of the figure, and the White Horse and nearby Wayland&#x27;s Smithy feature in a 1920s setting in the Inspector Ian Rutledge mystery/detective novel &quot;A Pale Horse&quot; by Charles Todd; a depiction of the White Horse appears on the book&#x27;s dust jacket. Tom Shippey suggests that the horse may have inspired the banner flown by the horsemen of Rohan in J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle Earth legendarium, which is a white horse upon a green field. The horse is central to the 1978 BBC Television serial &quot;The Moon Stallion&quot; by Brian Hayles, who later novelised the series. &quot;The horse on the chalk&quot; in Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Tiffany Aching series is inspired by the Uffington White Horse. Pratchett (who is famous for his sardonic humor) said &quot;By an &quot;amazing&quot; coincidence, the horse carved on the chalk in &quot;A Hat Full of Sky&quot; (2004) is remarkably similar to the Uffington White Horse.&quot; The White Horse is a significant setting, plot point, and symbol in the 2018 novel &quot;Lethal White&quot;, the fourth instalment in the Cormoran Strike detective series, and inspired the 2022 A. F. Steadman novel &quot;Skandar and The Unicorn Thief&quot;.

===Music===
John Gardner&#x27;s &quot;Ballad of the White Horse&quot; (1959) was inspired by Chesterton&#x27;s epic poem of the same name. It was recently recorded by the City of London Choir, accompanied by the BBC Concert Orchestra, and conducted by Hilary Davan Wetton.

David Bedford&#x27;s &quot;Song of the White Horse&quot; (1978), set for ensemble and children&#x27;s choir and commissioned for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Omnibus&quot; programme, depicts a journey along a footpath alongside the Uffington Horse and includes words from Chesterton&#x27;s poem. The composition requires the choir to inhale helium to sing the &quot;stratospherically high notes&quot; of the climax, accompanied by aerial footage of the horse animated to show it rearing up from the ground. A recording, produced by Mike Oldfield, was released by Oldfield Music in 1983.

The Uffington Horse is illustrated on the cover of &quot;English Settlement&quot; (1982), the fifth studio album by the Swindon band XTC, and appears (among other symbols copied from Barbara G. Walker&#x27;s &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Dictionary of Symbols and Sacred Objects&quot;) on the back cover of Nirvana&#x27;s final album, &quot;In Utero&quot; (1993). Painted in 2024, a public mural of the &quot;English Settlement&quot; sleeve, prominently depicting the Uffington Horse, features on Crombey Street, Swindon.

<text>Fort Defiance ( ) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Apache County, Arizona, United States. It is also located within the Navajo Nation. The population was 3,624 at the 2010 census.

== History ==

The land on which Fort Defiance was eventually established was first noted by the U.S. military when Colonel John Washington stopped there on his return journey from an expedition to Canyon de Chelly. Fort Defiance was established on September 18, 1851, by Col. Edwin V. Sumner to create a military presence in Diné bikéyah (Navajo territory). Sumner broke up the fort at Santa Fe for this purpose, creating the first military post in what is now Arizona. He left Major Electus Backus in charge.

Fort Defiance was built on valuable grazing land that the federal government then prohibited the Navajo from using. As a result, the appropriately named fort experienced intense fighting, culminating in two attacks: in 1856 and 1860. The next year, at the onset of the Civil War, the army abandoned Fort Defiance. Continued Navajo raids in the area led Brigadier General James H. Carleton to send Kit Carson to impose order. The fort was reestablished as Fort Canby in 1863 as a base for Carson&#x27;s operations against the Navajo. General Carleton&#x27;s &quot;solution&quot; was brutal: thousands of starving Navajo were forced on a Long Walk of and interned near Fort Sumner, New Mexico, and much of their livestock was destroyed. Following completion of this campaign in 1864 the fort was again abandoned and was burned by remaining Navajo, with only its walls remaining. The Navajo Treaty of 1868 allowed those interned to return to a portion of their land, and Fort Defiance was reestablished as an Indian agency that year. In 1870, the first government school for the Navajo was established there.

Today, the site of Fort Defiance is populated by buildings dating from the 1930s to the present day used by various governmental agencies including the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Indian Health Service, and the Navajo Nation. The largest of these buildings was the Fort Defiance Indian Hospital until 2002.

==History==

===Ancients and legends===
The earliest peoples in the region are believed to have been nomadic hunters in search of big game roaming throughout the Four Corners region. The next wave of inhabitants are believed to have been smaller hunter-gatherer communities of similar nomadic characteristic. It is believed that archaic forms of agriculture came to the Little Colorado River basin around .

The first permanent residents of the Ganado region (comprising greater Ganado, Kinlichee, Burnside, and Cornfields) were the &quot;Basketmaker&quot; Ancestral Puebloan. The ruins of their homesteads are scattered throughout the Little Colorado River basin and Colorado Plateau, among the red clay hills surrounding Ganado, and on the escarpment to the west. Significant agricultural advancement was seen in the first millennium. The largest Puebloan ruin at Ganado is Wide Reeds Ruin, along the floodplain near the present-day Ganado Wash bridge; and it is believed to have been constructed around 1276.

Modern understanding of the historical record left behind by the Ancestral Puebloans exhibits a massive network of villages, storehouses, and fortified structures throughout the Colorado Plateau region. Stretching from Mesa Verde in the north, to Chaco Canyon in the east, to Keet Seel (Kitsʼiil) and Betatakin (Bitátʼahkin) and Wupatki in the west, trading routes can be traced through the Ganado region to as far south as Mexico. Pottery fragments found through the area show a wide array of design and utility, both local and foreign to Ganado. The largest population center in this era near Ganado, is to the north at Canyon de Chelly.
Between 1276 and 1299, archaeologists have recorded a period of &quot;great drought,&quot; leading (among other causes) to the eventual end of influence of Puebloan culture and peoples on the Ganado region.

===Apaches and Navajos===
It is not known when the ancestors of the current Ganado community arrived in the Ganado region, though some suggest after 1400. The historical record left behind shows that the first Navajo people were of hunter-gatherer communities, who evolved into a nexus of agrarian society and pastoral society as the conditions of the area suited. Empowered by evolutionary dry farming techniques acquired via the neighboring Puebloan peoples, the early Ganado community&#x27;s main crops consisted of beans, corn, and squash.

The early Ganado Navajo, like the modern people today, were speakers of a Na-Dené Southern Athabaskan languages known as &quot;Diné bizaad&quot; (lit. &#x27;People&#x27;s language&#x27;). Archaeological data suggests these peoples arrived in the present day Four Corners &amp; Colorado Plateau regions in approximately the 15th century. The Navajo language retains cultural and linguistic aspects of this primary dialect and is somewhat mutually intelligible with the Western Apache language.

When the Spanish Conquistadors arrived in the southwestern Arizona–New Mexico region, they encountered these peoples, and subsequently named them Apaches de Nabajó Though distant relatives of the Apache peoples, these Apaches de Nabajó were different in both lineage and pathways to the area, from other Apache bands.

===Jilhéél &amp; Kin Naazinii (Upstanding House)===

A mix of oral legend and archeology suggest that singer, and warrior/ runner Jilhéél came to the Ganado area in the early 18th century. It is believed that he traveled extensively and lived amongst the Puebloan people along the Rio Grande, and migrated with many of them to the refuge of Dinetah at the start of the Spanish invasion and occupation of modern-day Arizona and New Mexico.

In Jilhéél, it is also believed, came many of the cultural, architectural and agricultural influences to the greater Ganado region. Research suggests that Jilhéél contributed to the construction of fortifications to the north and south, notably in the hills east of Wide Ruins to the southeast of Ganado. Archaeologist David M. Brugge offers that Jilhéél &quot;might have been a local headman of the mid-1770s, possibly a refugee from Awatobi, considering his clan (Táchiiʼnii) and his move to Black Mesa, a refuge of Tobacco Táchiiʼnii people from Awatobi.&quot; Oral history research suggests that he inhabited &quot;Wide Ruins, (meaning the Ancestral Puebloan site) and, a few miles north up Wide Ruins Wash, at&quot; the citadel of &quot;Kin Naazinii (Upstanding House)&quot;; if not contributed to its construction – with the help of elder Daalgai – &quot;a Navajo fortified &#x27;pueblito&#x27; that archaeologists date at 1720–1805 (NLC, site S-MLC-UP-L; Bannister and others 1966:8; Navajo Nation 1967:263, 271, 285; Gilpin 1996).&quot; Thus, Jilhéél is believed to have traveled between here &quot;north to Canyon de Chelly&quot; regularly.

Oral histories tells of a Jilhéél who carried &quot;gigantic arrows, and had enormous feet. The sight of his footprints struck terror in his enemies. Some say he was a hunter who could run down deer; others say he knew various healing and war ceremonies. Some say he was of the Red Streak into Water (Táchiiʼnii) clan and later moved to Black Mesa.&quot; His fame amongst Navajo oral history is well known amongst various historical families. &quot;Some of his attributes may reflect late pre-&quot; Hispanic &quot;iconography (big feet, for example, a common petroglyph motif). These pre-&quot; Hispanic &quot; associations of Jilhéél, together with the idea that Wide Ruins was some kind of &#x27;boundary&#x27; place between Hopi and Zuni zones ..., makes one wonder if the north-south travel corridor through Wide Ruins to Canyon de Chelly could have been a late &#x27;everyone&#x27;s land&#x27; as conceptualized by LaBlanc (1999:70, 333) between settlement clusters&quot; much older.

&quot;The north-south corridor that Jilhéél stalked encompasses a string of places with names that came from
incidents of raiding and warfare before the Fort Sumner captivity. Several recorded Navajo oral histories tell the stories (HUTR oral history interviews 21, 36, 44, 142; Kelley and Francis 1993–2005, project KF9906, 5/21 and 6/17/99, and project KF9507, 8/14/98). The place names, from south to north, are Anaaʼ Hajiina (Where the Enemy Came Up) north of Chambers; Dzilgha Adahjééʼ (Where the White Mountain Apaches Ran Down or Hilltop Descent), near Ganado&quot;, and the modern day location of Ganado Mucho&#x27;s burial site; &quot;and Dzilgha Haaskai (White Mountain Apaches Went Up, or Hilltop Ascent) near Chinle, Arizona (see Map 1). The places near Ganado and Chinle are places where Apaches came from the south up the corridor and massacred Navajos. (See also Nequatewa 1967:52 and Stephen 1930:1018–1019 for Hopi accounts of a killing of Hopis by Navajos in 1858 west of Ganado; local Navajo accounts apparently of the same incident have been recorded [HUTR interviews 44 and 142], one of which describes the massacre as an Apache attack on Navajos, perhaps reflecting confusion between the name for White Mountain Apaches and the almost identical word for hilltop).&quot;

===New Spain===

As a result of Ganado&#x27;s location at the crossroads of ancient trade routes and pueblos, Francisco Vásquez de Coronado&#x27;s exploration party passed near the Ganado area in 1540–1542 en route to the famous Hopi Villages to the west. &quot;Spanish colonial and later sources beginning with the 1540 Spanish Entrada (a detachment of the Coronado expedition) record indigenous trails linking the Wide Ruins area to Zuni and Awatobi. As the silver mines funded greater and greater Spanish expansion into the frontier of &quot;New Spain,&quot; King Philip II of Spain directed Conquistador Juan de Oñate to begin establishing Holy See missions in Nuevo México. As Roman Catholicism spread, by the 1629, &quot;the mission of San Bernardino was established at Awátobi by a party of four Franciscans headed by Father Francisco de Porras&quot;, as the Hopi villages were architecturally accommodating as built up population centers.

Spanish traffic was sustained from La Villa Real de la Santa Fe de San Francisco de Asís to the outlying Hopi mission up until the 1680 Popé&#x27;s Rebellion. In the &quot;spring of AD 1700 Father Juan Garaycoecha visited the remains of the Hopi mission at the request of the inhabitants&quot;; later that year, the remaining mission was soon after destroyed. The years 1778 to 1780 saw the first recorded drought to be experienced by the European and tribal historians alike, and was devastating to the regional population. The Spanish withdrawal from the region encompassing Ganado, continued until the American invasion of the 1800s.

Navajo and Hopi oral traditions tell how some people escaped and joined Navajos in the surrounding countryside near and far, giving rise to the Tobacco Táchiiʼnii clan (Clinton 1990, Brugge 1985, 1994; Courlander 1971).

===Invasion and Ganado Mucho===
The Ganado area remained relatively independent from rebellions of European ethnicity at Santa Fe until 1849. Ganado&#x27;s first event under the American government came when a Hopi delegation was sent to Santa Fe in 1850. In 1858, Joseph Christmas Ives led an expedition through the area near Ganado. From 1821, the Navajo people had been engaged in the Navajo Wars against the Spanish, Mexican, and American invaders until the 1864 forced removal from their homelands. This exodus known as the Long Walk, would not see legal Navajo return until June 18, 1868.

One Navajo elder said of the Long Walk:
By slow stages we traveled eastward by present Gallup and Chusbbito, Bear Spring, which is now called Fort Wingate. You ask how they treated us? If there was room the soldiers put the women and children on the wagons. Some even let them ride behind them on their horses. I have never been able to understand a people who killed you one day and on the next played with your children...?

By 1869, the Ganado area had been fully occupied by the United States Government at Fort Defiance.

During the Long Walk, Diné Chief totsohnii Hastiin (pronounced Toe-so-knee haaus-teen)(Navajo for Man of the big water Clan), famously known as Ganado Mucho (1809–1893), along with other leaders targeted by the United States (such as Manuelito) fled to the haven of the Grand Canyon. &quot;Of both Hopi and Navajo ancestry, Ganado Mucho was a cautious man who was inclined toward diplomacy&quot;. During the 1859 to 1861 period of resistance fighting, Ganado Mucho led the Ganado area on a policy of neutrality. This maneuver protected the Navajo residents of Ganado&#x27;s wealth, held in their livestock, from United States confiscation by Kit Carson.

By 1866, Ganado Mucho surrendered and was remanded to the Bosque Redondo reservation near Fort Sumner, New Mexico. When he, Barboncito and Manuelito arrived, they found James Henry Carleton&#x27;s experiment of resettlement a complete failure. While held in custody there, Ganado Mucho&#x27;s son was murdered. He addressed directly the New Mexican Superintendent of Indian Affairs – A. Baldwin Norton – and condemned the conditions at Bosque Redondo. After the treaty of 1868, Ganado Mucho and his community returned to Ganado. Following, Ganado Mucho was &quot;appointed subchief of the western Navajo by General William Tecumseh Sherman. He lived there until his death, and is buried on a hillside between Ganado and Cornfields.

===Hubbell trading post===

The first American settlements in the Ganado area were located near what is now Ganado Lake, and was established in 1871 as a trading post owned by Charles Crary. A second post operated by &quot;Old Man&quot; William B. Leonard opened soon after. These trading posts were established as a service to the Navajo people after the formation of the Fort Defiance Indian reservation, as a means to provide goods not locally available.

The first name for the settlement was probably Pueblo Colorado when Don Lorenzo Hubbell (1853–1930) moved into the area in 1876. Two years later, he purchased his world-famous homestead, trading post and out buildings from William Leonard, which were constructed in 1874. Legend says that in an effort not to confuse visitors in the area with Pueblo, Colorado, Hubbell changed the name of the settlement to Ganado in honor of Ganado Mucho, the twelfth signer of the Navajo peace treaty of 1868.

Born to an Anglo father, and Spanish mother, Hubbell was raised at Pajarito Mesa, New Mexico. He was twenty three when he relocated to Ganado. He married Lina Rubi, and the couple had two sons (Roman and Lorenzo Jr.) and two daughters (Adele and Barbara). The family added onto the current adobe building which would become the famous Hubbell home, which hosted such guests as Theodore Roosevelt. The Hubbell garden contained Virginia creeper, a lawn, as well as native wild and yellow roses, lilac and yucca.

Hubbell died in 1930, and his youngest son, Roman Hubbell, assumed management duties. The stone Hogan (cottage) was constructed by Roman and his wife Dorothy in the early 1930s as a memorial to the elder Hubbell. Upon Roman&#x27;s death in 1957, Dorothy maintained operations until 1967 when the National Park Service acquired the homestead. Hubbell, his wife, three of his children, a daughter-in-law, and a granddaughter are buried on the cone-shaped hill northwest of the trading post. Many Horses, son of Ganado Mucho, is also interred at this Hubbell family cemetery.

Hubbell contributed to encouraging the Ganado textiles market and local Navajo weaving houses.

Other retail trading posts included Ganado Trading, and Shillingburg&#x27;s (later Round Top). The Presbyterian Church established a mission, school and hospital in Ganado in 1901.

===Americanization of Navajo children and boarding school===
The hidden cost of the Navajo relocation by the United States government were felt in many ways. The most direct would be in the forced removal of their children to boarding schools from the late 19th century into the 20th century. Many Ganado area youth were sent to such government and Christian boardings schools such as at Fort Apache. In most cases, the children were far removed from their families to foreign locations. Research has shown that such Americanization practices by the boarding schools, employed first by Captain Richard Henry Pratt served to destroy any last vestiges of Navajo identity, and Ganado children during this period were not immune to such inhumane practices. Pratt&#x27;s systemic Americanization of Native Americans by forced cultural assimilation, used as a model for Indian Boarding schools all over America, was later regarded by some as a form of cultural genocide.

===Modern Ganado===
The Ganado community today is of the most advanced communities on the Navajo Nation. Agricultural parcels are managed by a local board of Farming advocates, and the surrounding ranches are sources of organic beef and mutton. The high school men and woman basketball teams are state renowned for their gamesmanship. Sage Memorial Hospital serves thousands of Hopi and Navajo patients, while affording ethnic Navajo experience to resident physicians and nurses. Hubbell Trading Post hosts a yearly art show in late summer which includes displays of art, jewelry, and rug weaving. The Ganado Rodeo Club also hosts events. The greater Ganado community is quite active, and throughout the winter months hold numerous Navajo religious ceremonies. Ganado municipal legislators also contribute largely to the policy and decision making of the Navajo Nation Government, most recently, in the tribal decision to reorganize the membership of the Navajo Nation Council.
==Education==
Ganado is served by the Ganado Unified School District. The district is served by Ganado Elementary School (North and South); Ganado Middle School; and Ganado High School, which host the region&#x27;s athletic (football, track and field, swimming, basketball) facilities.

Ganado hosts satellite campuses for various collegiate level schools such as Diné College and Northern Arizona University.

===College of Ganado===
Ganado was once home to the nursing school (founded in 1927) that would soon become the College of Ganado. The collegiate campus was located on the campus of the Presbyterian Mission. Several buildings, such as Adobe West Dormitory, Cedar Lodge, Locust Cottage, Greenawalt House, and Poncel Hall remain; many of the former campus buildings are utilized by Sage Memorial Hospital. Founded in 1901, the mission community soon elected to build a nursing school for the Ganado community in 1911. Dr. Clarence Salsbury and his wife Cora organized &quot;the first nursing school for Native Americans at the mission in Ganado. The school trained some 100 women from more than twenty tribes and several foreign countries. The institution was accredited by the State of Arizona and its graduates were highly regarded in their field&quot;. Dr. William Worrall Mayo, founder of the Mayo Clinic was a guest lecturer there.

==Ganado Art Community==

===Navajo weaving and &quot;Ganado red&quot;===
 Ganado is home to Navajo weaving style &quot;Ganado Red&quot;. From the early 1900s demand for Ganado-produced fine rugs and blankets has grown steadily and has become world-famous since Lorenzo Hubbell began fostering the art and marketplace at his trading post.

===Navajo silversmithing===
Ganado is home to small community of silversmiths, who specialize in Navajo Jewelry.

==Transportation==
The Ganado Airport is a general aviation airport controlled by the Navajo Nation. The runway is GRS natural surface-ungraded earth runway measuring approximately , south of the junction of Indian Route 27, and Arizona State Route 264. Plans by the Ganado Chapter envision future plans for ASP-Asphalt pavement surface. No control tower, parking tarmac, storage hangars, or other facilities exist at this time.

<text>Many Farms () is a census-designated place (CDP) in Apache County, Arizona, United States. The population was 1,348 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==

== History ==
Many Farms is an English translation of the Navajo name of the area and is descriptive. The farms became fully irrigated in 1937.

From 1952 to 1962, the Many Farms community was the location of two major medical experiments led by Walsh McDermott. The goal of the first experiment was to test the efficacy of the drug isoniazid as a treatment for tuberculosis (TB), which was then widespread and largely fatal among the Navajo despite the availability of TB medication elsewhere in the country. McDermott chose the reservation because he needed a population that had not been previously exposed to streptomycin, then the most advanced treatment for TB. While McDermott&#x27;s initial TB experiment was a success, his second experiment, in which he attempted a more broad-based healthcare intervention, failed to meaningfully reduce disease morbidity and mortality among the Navajo due to conflicts with the Indian Health Service, as well as the experiment&#x27;s inability to address poverty, which was the underlying cause of most disease.

Casa Malpaís is located near Springerville. It is a nationally recognized archeological site.

The name &quot;Casa Malpais&quot; means &quot;House built from Malapai&quot;, which describes the type volcanic vesicular basalt from which the ancient village was constructed. It is thought that the name was given to the village by early Basque sheepherders. The Springerville volcanic field contains over 400 volcanoes within a radius of Springerville, making it the third largest volcanic field in the continental United States.

The first visit to Casa Malpais by a professional anthropologist was in 1883, when Frank Cushing, living at Zuni, visited a site at &quot;El Valle Redondo on the Colorado Chiquito&quot;, and was impressed by what he termed &quot;the fissure type pueblo&quot; he found there. In his journal he sketched dry masonry, bridging fissures, upon which the pueblo is constructed.

Unique and unusual features characterize the site. The Great Kiva, painstakingly constructed of volcanic rock, is the centerpiece. A steep basalt staircase set into a crevice of the high red cliff wall leads to the top of the mesa.

Both the Hopi and Zuni people still consider Casa Malpais a sacred ancestral place.

The town contains one of the twelve &quot;Madonna of the Trail&quot; monuments created by sculptor August Leimbach.

The town is close to the Apache–Sitgreaves National Forests, which run along the Mogollon Rim. It is also close to the Sunrise Ski Resort.

The El Rio opened in 1915, making it the oldest movie theater in Arizona. It was originally called the Apache Theater, until it was changed in 1937 to the El Rio.

==Quotes==
:&quot;I was the one who had Apache county separated from Yavapai. Everything was very high at that time, and I used to haul my goods from Albuquerque to live on. I was hauling goods one time from Henry Springer&#x27;s store in Albuquerque, and I told Henry Springer he had better come into Round Valley, as it was called then, and put in a store; that the people were coming in and we would name the postoffice and little village after him, Springerville, and that was old Henry Springer.&quot;
:——James G. H. Colter from History of Arizona, Volume VI

<text>St. Johns (, ) is the county seat of Apache County, Arizona, United States. It is located along U.S. Route 180, mostly west of where that highway intersects with U.S. Route 191. As of the 2010 census, the population of the city was 3,480.

== History ==

The location was originally called Tsézhin Deezʼáhí in Navajo, a reference to its rock formations. The site of a useful crossing of the Little Colorado River, it was later called El Vadito (Spanish for &quot;the little crossing&quot;) by Spaniards as they first explored the area. Starting in 1864, a trader named Solomon Barth began crossing the area as he moved salt from a salt lake in Zuni territory to Prescott, Arizona. In a poker game in 1873 Barth earned enough money to purchase cattle and enough land in St. Johns to start a ranch with his brothers Nathan and Morris. He changed the name from El Vadito to San Juan. There is some controversy as to whether this was in honor of the first woman resident, Maria San Juan Baca de Padilla, or of the feast of San Juan. William R. Milligan arrived in 1866, followed by Frank Walker in 1870. By 1872 a Spanish-American agricultural community had developed. A stone cabin was erected by Juan Sedilla in 1874. Solomon Barth sold out to Mormon Ammon M. Tenney in 1875 or 1879. A Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints community named Salem and led by David King Udall was established just north of the town under the direction of Wilford Woodruff on March 29, 1880, and then moved to higher ground by Erastus Snow on September 19 of the same year.

St. Johns has been the county seat for almost all of Apache County&#x27;s history. When the county was created on February 24, 1879, Snowflake was designated the county seat. After the first election in fall 1879, county government was set up in St. Johns, though it was moved again in 1880, to Springerville; in 1882 St. Johns again became the county seat, and it has remained so ever since.

<text>Window Rock, known in Navajo as Tségháhoodzání (), is a city and census-designated place that serves as the capital of the Navajo Nation, the largest Native American tribe by both land and tribal enrollment. The capital lies within the boundaries of the St. Michaels Chapter, adjacent to the Arizona and New Mexico state line. Window Rock is the site of the Navajo Nation governmental campus, which contains the Navajo Nation Council, Navajo Nation Supreme Court, the offices of the Navajo Nation President and Vice President, and many Navajo government buildings.

Window Rock&#x27;s population was 2,500 at the 2020 census. It is estimated to reach around 20,000 during weekdays when tribal offices are open.

Window Rock&#x27;s main natural attraction is the window formation of sandstone (Entrada Sandstone) which the community is named after. The Navajo Nation Museum, the Navajo Nation Zoological and Botanical Park, and the Navajo Nation Code Talkers World War II memorial are tribal attractions located in Window Rock.

== Name ==

Until 1936, the area was sparsely populated and known by the Navajo only by its ceremonial name (&quot;Center of the World&quot;). John Collier, a reforming Commissioner of Indian Affairs, chose this site to establish the seat of the Navajo Central Agency, the Bureau of Indian Affairs official connection to the nation. His proposal to make the ceremonial name the official name met with resistance, and Navajos soon ridiculed it as &quot;&quot; (~ &quot;into your middle (parts)&quot;).

Due to this, the BIA chose the name of the major local landmark, the rock-with-hole-through-it (Navajo: ) for this Indian agency site. It was rendered in English as &quot;Window Rock&quot;. This landmark is north of the Navajo governmental administration buildings. It is important in the traditional Navajo Water Way Ceremony (), as one of the four places where Navajo medicine men go with their traditional woven water jugs to get water for the ceremony that is held to pray for an abundance of rainfall.

<text>Benson is a city in Cochise County, Arizona, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 5,355. It was founded as a rail terminal for the area, and located approximately east-southeast of the city of Tucson.

==History==
The city was founded in 1880 when the Southern Pacific Railroad came through. It was named after Judge William S. Benson, a friend of Charles Crocker, president of the Southern Pacific. The railroad, coming overland from California, chose the Benson site to cross the San Pedro River. Benson then served as a rail junction point to obtain ore and refined metal by wagon, in turn shipping rail freight back to the mines at Tombstone, Fairbank, Contention City and Bisbee. For example, the railhead in Benson was about from Tombstone, and was the closest rail connection to it until 1882, when a feeder line was laid from Benson to Contention City.

The railhead in Benson was founded about a mile from a traditional crossing of the upper San Pedro River (known also as the Middle Crossing), used by the Southern Emigrant Trail and San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line. It was the site of the San Pedro Station of the Butterfield Overland Mail and a wagon depot, the San Pedro River Station, run since 1871 by William Ohnesorgen. In 1878 he had erected a toll bridge over which mining supplies were transported to the new mining camps such as Fairbank and Tombstone. Two years later this bridge marked the location of the railroad bridge that became the terminal site of Benson.

Apache Nitrogen Products (originally Apache Powder Company) was formed in the 1920s. It was located just outside Benson and was a major employer. Apache Park and nine nearby houses on West 6th Street in Benson, built to house company management, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994 as the Apache Powder Historic Residential District.

The city today is perhaps best known as the gateway to Kartchner Caverns State Park. It is also home to the acclaimed Singing Wind Bookshop, which specializes in books about the Southwest.

Benson first appeared on the 1890 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. It did not appear on the 1900 census. It reappeared again in 1910. It did not return separately (as a village) in 1920, but the population for the Benson Precinct of Cochise County (825) was substituted (which included the village of Benson and adjacent area). It formally incorporated as a town in 1924 and has returned on every census since 1930. On March 26, 1985, voters approved a resolution upgrading Benson to city status.

<text>Bisbee is a city in and the county seat of Cochise County in southeastern Arizona, United States. It is southeast of Tucson and north of the Mexican border. According to the 2020 census, the population of the town was 4,923, down from 5,575 in the 2010 census.

==History==

Bisbee was founded as a copper, gold, and silver mining town in 1880, and named in honor of Judge DeWitt Bisbee, one of the financial backers of the adjacent Copper Queen Mine.

The town was the site of the Bisbee Riot in 1919.

In 1929, the county seat was moved from Tombstone to Bisbee, where it remains.

===Mining industry===
Mining in the Mule Mountains proved quite successful: in the early 20th century the population of Bisbee soared. Incorporated in 1902, by 1910 its population had swelled to 9,019, the third largest in the territory, and it sported a constellation of suburbs, including Warren, Lowell, and San Jose, some of which had been founded on their own (ultimately less successful) mines. In 1917, open-pit mining was successfully introduced to meet the copper demand during World War I.

A high quality turquoise promoted as &quot;Bisbee Blue&quot; was a by-product of the copper mining. Many high-quality mineral specimens have come from Bisbee area mines and are to be found in museum collections worldwide. Some of these minerals include cuprite, aragonite, wulfenite, malachite, azurite, and galena.

===Bisbee deportation===
Miners attempted to organize to gain better working conditions and wages. In 1917, the Phelps Dodge Corporation, using private police and deputized sheriffs in conjunction with Cochise County Sheriff Harry C. Wheeler, kidnapped at gunpoint over 1,000 striking miners, packed them into cattle cars, and shipped them for sixteen hours through the desert without food or water to the town to Hermanas, New Mexico, due to allegations that they were members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). The company wanted to prevent unionization, while the IWW sought safer mining conditions and the end of discrimination between US-born and immigrant workers. Earlier that year, industry police conducted the Jerome Deportation, similarly intended to expel striking miners.

===Mining decline and tourism===
Continued underground work enabled the town to survive the changes in mining that caused mines in neighboring towns to close, leading to a resulting dramatic loss of population. But the population of Bisbee had dropped nearly 60%, from a high of 9,205 in 1920 down to 3,801 by 1950. In 1975 the Phelps Dodge Corporation halted its Bisbee copper-mining operations. Bisbee Mayor Chuck Eads, with the cooperation of Phelps Dodge, implemented development of a mine tour and historic interpretation of a portion of the Copper Queen Mine as part of an effort to create heritage tourism as another economic base to compensate for the financial loss due to the end of the mining industry.

Community volunteers cleared tons of fallen rock and re-timbered the old workings. Eventually, this local effort came to the attention of the federal Economic Development Administration. It approved a large grant to Bisbee to help the mine tour project and other improvements in downtown Bisbee; these were designed to meet tourist business needs. The Queen Mine Tour was officially opened to visitors on February 1, 1976. More than a million visitors have taken the underground mine tour train.
===Modern Bisbee===

From 1950 to 1960, the sharp population decline happening over the previous few decades changed course and the number of residents of Bisbee increased by nearly 160 percent when open-pit mining was undertaken and the city annexed nearby areas. The peak population was in 1960, at 9,914.

In the following decade, there was a decline in jobs and population, although not as severe as from 1930 to 1950. But, the economic volatility resulted in a crash in housing prices. Coupled with an attractive climate and picturesque scenery, Bisbee became a destination in the 1960s for artists and hippies of the counter culture.

Artist Stephen Hutchison and his wife Marcia purchased the Copper Queen Hotel, the town&#x27;s anchor business and architectural gem, from the Phelps-Dodge mining company in 1970. The company had tried to find a local buyer, offering the deed to any local resident for the sum of $1, but there were no takers. The property needed renovation for continued use.

Hutchison purchased and renovated the hotel, as well as other buildings in the downtown area. One held the early 20th-century Brewery and Stock Exchange. Hutchison began to market Bisbee as a destination of the &quot;authentic,&quot; old Southwest. His work attracted the developer Ed Smart.

Among the many guests at the hotel have been celebrities from nearby California. Actor John Wayne was a frequent visitor to Bisbee and the Copper Queen. He befriended Hutchison and eventually partnered with Smart in his real estate ventures. This period of Bisbee&#x27;s history is well documented in contemporary articles in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and in an article by Cynthia Buchanan in &quot;The Cornell Review&quot;. It was at this time that Bisbee became a haven for artists and hippies fleeing the larger cities of Arizona and California. Later it attracted people priced out by gentrification of places such as Aspen, Colorado.

In the 1990s, additional people were attracted to Bisbee, leading it to develop such amenities as coffee shops and live theatre. Many of the old houses have been renovated, and property values in Bisbee now greatly exceed those of other southeastern Arizona cities.

Today, the historic Bisbee is known as &quot;Old Bisbee&quot; and is home to a thriving downtown cultural scene. This area is noted for its architecture, including Victorian-style houses and an elegant Art Deco county courthouse. Because its plan was laid out to a pedestrian scale before the automobile, Old Bisbee is compact and walkable. The town&#x27;s hilly terrain is exemplified by the old four-story high school; each floor has a ground-level entrance.


====Suburbs====
Bisbee now includes the satellite communities of Warren, Lowell, and San Jose. The Lowell and Warren townsites were consolidated into Bisbee proper during the early part of the twentieth century. There are also smaller neighborhoods interspersed between these larger boroughs, including Galena, Bakerville, Tintown, South Bisbee, Briggs, and Saginaw.

Warren was Arizona&#x27;s first planned community. It was designed as a bedroom community for the more affluent citizens of the mining district. Warren has a fine collection of Arts and Crafts style bungalow houses. Many have been recognized as historic places, and the city has an annual home tour during which a varying selection are offered for tours. Since the end of mining in the 1970s, Warren has seen a steady decline in its standard of living. The residential district still houses a significant portion of the population, and includes City Hall, Greenway Elementary School, Bisbee High School, and the historic Warren Ballpark.

Lowell was at one time a sizable mining town located just to the southeast of Old Bisbee. The majority of the original townsite was consumed by the excavation of the Lavender Pit mine during the 1950s. All that is left today is a small portion of Erie Street, along with Evergreen Cemetery, Saginaw subdivision and Lowell Middle School. These days Lowell is considered by most of the local residents to be more of a place name than an operating community.

San Jose, on the southern side of the Mule Mountains, is the most modern of the city&#x27;s subdivisions. As it is not restricted by mountains, it has had the most new growth since the late 1990s. Named after a nearby Mexican mountain peak, it is the location of many newer county government buildings, the Huachuca Terrace Elementary School, and a large shopping center.

====Current state of mining industry====
In 2007, Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold bought Phelps-Dodge company. Freeport has invested in Bisbee by remediating soil contaminated in previous mining operations, donations to the school system, and other civic activities.

==Geography==
Arizona State Route 80 runs through the city, leading northwest to Tombstone and to Benson, and east to Douglas. The Mexican border at Naco is south of the center of Bisbee.

Natural vegetation around Bisbee has a semi-desert appearance with shrubby acacia, oak and the like, along with cacti, grass, ocotillo and yucca. The town itself is much more luxuriant with large trees such as native cypress, sycamore and cottonwood plus the introduced ailanthus and Old World cypresses, cedars and pines. Palms are capable of growing tall, but are not reliably hardy. At least one mature blue spruce may be seen.

The event has grown to include the Ice Man Competition, designed to honor the history of men delivering blocks of ice by hand before the advent of refrigeration. In the Ice Man Competition, entrants race up 155 steps carrying a ten-pound block of ice with antique ice tongs.

Bisbee hosts an annual Blues festival, occurring in 2015 during the second week of September. The festival effectively lengthens the tourist season, and provides a large amount of business to local bars and breweries.

<text>Douglas is a city in Cochise County, Arizona, United States, that lies in the north-west to south-east running Sulphur Springs Valley. Douglas has a border crossing with Mexico at Agua Prieta and a history of mining.

The population was 16,531 in the 2020 Census.

==History==
The Douglas area was first settled by the Spanish in the 18th century. Presidio de San Bernardino was established in 1776 and abandoned in 1780. It was located a few miles east of present-day Douglas. The United States Army established Camp San Bernardino in the latter half of the 19th century near the presidio, and in 1910 Camp Douglas was built next to the town.

Douglas was founded as an American smelter town, to treat the copper ores of nearby Bisbee, Arizona. The town is named after mining pioneer Dr. James Douglas and was incorporated in 1905. Two copper smelters operated at the site. The Calumet and Arizona Company Smelter was built in 1902. The Copper Queen operated in Douglas from 1904 until 1931, when the Phelps Dodge Corporation purchased the Calumet and Arizona Company and took over their smelter. The Calumet and Arizona smelter then became the Douglas Reduction Works. Douglas was the site of the Phelps-Dodge Corporation Douglas Reduction Works until its closure in 1987. The smoke stacks of the smelter were not taken down until January 13, 1991. The town was a site of the Arizona Copper Mine Strike of 1983.

The &quot;Cowboys Home Saloon&quot; was the location of the fatal shooting of bar owner Lorenzo &quot;Lon&quot; Bass. The accused was Arizona Ranger William W. Webb. The date was February 8, 1903.

In 1916, the Mexican revolutionary leader Pancho Villa threatened to attack Douglas, believing Americans responsible for his defeat at the Second Battle of Agua Prieta.

On June 23, 1926, missing evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson was found collapsed near a road at the adjacent Mexican town of Agua Prieta. She was driven into Douglas and told a story of kidnap, torture and escape as she convalesced at Calumet Hospital. There, large crowds gathered, anxious to see the famous Canadian-American celebrity minister. She had earlier disappeared from a beach near Los Angeles and was believed drowned. For a period of several weeks, Douglas enjoyed a brisk tourist boom as police, reporters and others visited the town and the nearby desert to investigate her story. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Mrs. McPherson put Douglas square on the map and the citizens here appear grateful that it was in Douglas she sought refuge.&quot;
In 1989, the Sinaloa Cartel dug a tunnel between a house in Agua Prieta to a warehouse located in Douglas that it used to smuggle drugs across the international border. It was discovered in May 1990. Following its discovery, the Cartel refocused their smuggling operations towards Tijuana and Otay Mesa, San Diego where it acquired a warehouse in 1992. Other tunnels would also later be built in Arizona including sites at Naco and Nogales.

The town has been physically divided from Agua Prieta with a tall border wall built under President George W. Bush.

==Cityscape==

===Arts and culture===

Douglas is home to the historic Gadsden Hotel, which opened in 1907. Named for the Gadsden Purchase, the stately five-story, 160-room hotel became a home away from home for cattlemen, ranchers, miners, and businessmen. The hotel was leveled by fire and rebuilt in 1929. The Gadsden is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Gadsden&#x27;s spacious main lobby is majestically set with a solid white Italian marble staircase and four soaring marble columns. A stained glass window mural by 5th generation Artisan Ralph Baker, who studied under Louis Comfort Tiffany, extends across the eastern wall of the massive mezzanine. The mural of the Southwest Desert is an adaptive work of art that changes colors and depths throughout the day and seasons including the sunrising on the horizon of the mural. An impressive oil painting by Audley Dean Nicols is just below the Tiffany-style window. Vaulted stained glass skylights run the full length of the lobby.

The San Bernardino Ranch, 14 miles east of the town of Douglas, was originally established in Mexico and covered thousands of acres. The new US-Mexico border of the Gadsden Purchase sliced through the ranch, thus reducing its US size. Today the ranch is called &quot;Slaughter Ranch,&quot; named after the lawman John Slaughter, who owned the ranch in the late 19th century and early 20th century.

The El Paso and Southwestern Railroad depot was an important train station. It transported copper to large manufacturing concerns in the east. The depot is considered one of the finest examples of railway architecture of the early 20th century. The building is now used for the Douglas police station and is just one of 400 buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Douglas.

The Douglas Grand Theatre was built in 1919 and was the largest theater between Los Angeles and San Antonio. Ginger Rogers, Anna Pavlova and John Philip Sousa are some of the famous faces to have graced the theater&#x27;s stage. It also housed a tea room, candy store and barbershop in its glory days. For several Halloweens the Grand Theater was used as a &quot;Haunted House&quot; attraction. Today (2009) the theater is undergoing reconstruction, using private donations of money, supplies and labor.

===Cemeteries===
The Douglas Jewish Cemetery was founded in 1904 near the Mexican border. It has nineteen recorded graves, and thirteen of the tombstones are not necessarily on the correct grave sites due to extensive vandalism. The cemetery was in use from 1912 to 1963. The cemetery was restored, re-fenced and cleaned in 1992 by students and numerous others. The cemetery is included in the State of Arizona of Historical Places.

==Government==
Jose Grijalva, born and raised in Douglas, Arizona, is the 33rd Mayor of the city. At 38, he has dedicated his life to community service, including volunteering, serving as an assistant preacher, and working as a city council member for six years. He currently chairs the Finance Committee, overseeing the city&#x27;s financial matters.

==Transportation==
The city of Douglas operates Douglas Rides, which provides local transportation. The city also operates Cochice Connection, which provides connections between Douglas, Bisbee, and Sierra Vista. Private shuttle services connect Douglas with Tucson and Phoenix.

<doc id="106577" wikidata="Q1862064" url="?curid=106577" title="Naco, Arizona">
<text>Naco is a census-designated place (CDP) located in Cochise County, Arizona, United States. Naco had a recorded population of 1,046 at the 2010 United States Census. Located directly across the United States–Mexico border from its sister city of Naco, Sonora, Naco is best known for an accidental 1929 air raid and is the first and only municipality in the Continental United States to have been aerially bombed by foreigners.

==History==
The present-day unincorporated town of Naco, Arizona, was established in the early 20th century. The area was originally settled by the Nahua and Opata Indians. &quot;Naco&quot; means &quot;nopal cactus&quot; in the Opata language. The U.S. Congress officially established Naco as a Port of Entry on June 28, 1902. Today, the Naco port of entry is open 24 hours per day.

Occasionally the people on both sides of the border use the border fence as the net in a volleyball game.

===1929 air raid===
The accidental 1929 Bombing of Naco by Irish-American mercenary Patrick Murphy is notable for being the first and only instance where a town in the Continental United States was bombed by aircraft working for a foreign power. The 1942 Lookout Air Raids, when a Japanese floatplane pilot made two unsuccessful attempts to start forest fires in rural Oregon, and the 1944-45 unmanned Fu-Go Fire balloon attacks, also by the Japanese, are the only other cases of the Continental United States enduring aerial bombing by a foreign power. Such events are exceptionally rare in American history because during 20th century conflicts, most notably World War I and World War II, the continental United States escaped the large-scale aerial bombings that devastated many Asian and European cities.

The background to the bombing of Naco started in early 1929, when José Gonzalo Escobar led a rebellion against the government of Emilio Portes Gil. Mexican federal troops dug in around Naco,

Patrick Murphy was an aviator who owned his own bi-winged airplane and performed tricks with it. Murphy decided to help the rebels by offering to build homemade bombs and drop them on federal positions. His offer was accepted by the rebels, who promised a reward. Three of his bombs inadvertently landed on the Arizona side of the border, hitting various buildings in Naco.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

==Attractions==
Naco was home to the Turquoise Valley Golf Course, the oldest continuously operated golf course in Arizona—the first to reach 100 continuous years of age. It was purchased from long time owner Pete Lawson by HGM Golf Enterprises in May 2015. The ownership changed hands three more times when Joseph Lewis, a real estate developer from Phoenix, in June 2018. The course was permanently closed in June 2019.

==Demographics==

As of the U.S. 2010 census, there were 1046 people, 334 households, and 284 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . The racial makeup of the CDP was 62.8% White, 0.67% Native American, 33.7% from other races, and 2.88% from two or more races. 83.9% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 334 households, out of which 146 had children under the age of 18 living with them.

In the CDP, the age distribution of the population shows 40.5% under the age of 18, 5.9% from 18 to 24, 11% from 25 to 34, 15.8% from 35 to 49, 15% from 50 to 64, and 11.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The population of Naco, by 2010 census estimates, is 48.7% male, 51.3% female.

According to the 2000 census, the median income for a household in the CDP was $22,045, and the median income for a family was $25,227. Males had a median income of $21,923 versus $15,882 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $9,169. About 33.0% of families and 34.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 46.1% of those under age 18 and 25.4% of those age 65 or over.

==Prehistoric Naco==
The Naco-Mammoth Kill Site is located near Naco. Excavations from this archeological site in the 1950s revealed mammoth bones with embedded Clovis points, providing evidence of the hunting activities of Paleo-Indians some 13,000 years ago.

==Fort Naco==
Fort Naco is a former military post on the outskirts of Naco. Subsequent to Pancho Villa&#x27;s raid on Columbus, New Mexico, in 1916, Fort Naco was a staging area for American troops protecting the border. It was the headquarters of the 1st Infantry Regiment of the Arizona National Guard.

==Transportation==
The Bisbee Bus provides transportation from Naco to Bisbee.

==History==
As evidenced by several neolithic sites, which include the Murray Springs Clovis Site and known archeological sites like the Lehner Mammoth-Kill Site, Paleo-Indians, along with animals including mammoths, horses, tapirs, bison, and camels occupied the area more than 11,000 years ago. Both the Murray Springs Clovis Site and the Lehner Mammoth-Kill Site are now National Historic Landmarks. This area was the home to a large Sobaipuri Pueblo near Fairbank which had several smaller pueblos and settlements throughout the valley, a Spanish Fort, Presidio Santa Cruz de Terrenate between modern Huachuca City , Whetstone, and Tombstone, on the west bank of the San Pedro River. along with a few Spanish settlers supporting the route to Tucson&#x27;s Mission San Xavier del Bac and &quot;Presidio San Agustín del Tucsón&quot;. Coronado National Memorial was established in the southern Huachuca Mountains to commemorate the expedition of the Spanish conquistador Francisco Vázquez de Coronado utilizing the nearby San Pedro River in his northward search of the Cities of Cíbola, often referred to now as the mythical Seven Cities of Gold.

Like most of Cochise County, this area was part of the Gadsden Purchase of 1854. Camp Huachuca was established in 1877. At the end of the Apache Wars in 1886, with the protection of the fort and the completion of the Southern Pacific and El Paso &amp; Southwestern railroads, the San Pedro Valley began to be populated by American settlers.

The first business that opened just outside the east gate of Fort Huachuca was a saloon and &quot;house of ill repute&quot; owned by John and Ellen Reilly, which opened in 1892. In 1911, Margaret Carmichael bought the Reilly homestead and business. By 1913, Margaret Carmichael had leased the business back to the Reillys. Also in 1913, a group of dry land farmers settled in the local area and named their settlement Buena. Buena was east of Garden Canyon, between Lewis Springs and Fort Huachuca, east of the junction of present-day Hwy 90 and Hwy 92. At this site was a post office and a school house that served children in Buena, Garden Canyon, and outreaches of the local area. Oliver Fry and his two oldest sons traveled from Texas on the railroad and settled on just east of Fort Huachuca in January 1913.

By 1917, the Overton Post Office was established. This name came from the Overton Mercantile and Investment Company, which took an option on the Carmichael property with plans to develop a townsite outside Fort Huachuca. It is believed that the company was unable to persuade anyone to move to the area, so when the option expired the Carmichaels took back the property with a general mercantile store and the post office.

In 1918, the Carmichaels named their store after the Garden Canyon Sawmill. They also called their post office, where Carmichael was the postmaster, Garden Canyon. The Carmichaels built a home across the street from Garden Canyon store, as well as 18 stone houses, on Garden Avenue. From 1927 to 1938, the Frys rented the Carmichael store and ran the post office. The Frys established their own general store and the first federally recognized post office in 1938, the Fry Post Office, so the name of this settlement changed to Fry. By World War II, Fry&#x27;s reputation was less than salubrious. According to the &quot;Employment of Negro Troops&quot; (CMH), &quot;Because it was surrounded by a desert with no nearby communities and because it was located in a part of the country with practically no Negro population, Fort Huachuca, since the days when it was a frontier post garrisoned with Negro soldiers of the old regiments, had considered Fry a quasi-necessary adjunct... In Fry lived women... As the post commander described it in 1942: The small town of Fry is dirty, unsanitary and squalid. It has been so for many years. It was made worse in these respects during
the construction of the cantonment...&quot; (p. 282)

When the base was reactivated on February 1, 1954, base commander Brigadier General Emil Lenzner, pushed for incorporation as both a way to solve the on-base housing problems as well as to distance themselves from reputation of &quot;The White City&quot; and Fry Town Settlement, hoping to encourage people to want to live off base in a more family-friendly community, away from undesirables like the minorities allowed to live unsegregated in Fry Town. Petitions for incorporation began to be filed in 1955 and were legally accepted in 1956, which included what had been Garden Canyon and Buena but did not include most of Fry Town. This was in part to keep a Federal Housing Authority (FHA) housing project contacts for housing off post away from the Fry Town area, and was used as a rationale to incorporate and begin getting a share of tax revenues without having to pay the Fry family for the parts of Fry Town considered desirable and wholesome.

In 1955, the first attempt to incorporate and rename the area was rejected, as Fry opposed both incorporating and renaming the town that bore his family name. In 1956, the ballot issue failed 76 to 61. People who owned land outside of Fry&#x27;s property in the area of Garden Canyon/Overton and Buena, as well as parts of Fry went forward with incorporation and renaming by petition on May 26, 1956, excluding the half-square-mile owned by Fry that included the local red light district called &quot;the White City&quot; as well as off base housing of the African-American &quot;Buffalo&quot; soldier officers&#x27; families, and other minorities and groups they considered undesirable in the 1950s. They were described as the &quot;Fry People.&quot; When Sierra Vista was incorporated, it did not include the enclave of Fry, which remains an unincorporated area within the city of Sierra Vista.

Sierra Vista was incorporated in 1956. The proposed town council held a radio contest asking for names of the proposed town. Marie Pfister, the city clerk, asked her friend Nola Walker to store the suggestions. When the town was approved, they called Nola for the contest winner, but without counting the votes she told them her personal entry of &quot;Sierra Vista&quot; was the winner. On July 13, 2006, at a special ceremony during the city&#x27;s 50th anniversary, Nola was granted &quot;clemency&quot; for her misrepresentation of the vote.

In 1961 the community had grown large enough to be classified as a city, allowing the establishment of a community college. In 1973 Ethel Berger became the first female mayor in Arizona. In the 1970s the Art in the Park Festival was established by a committee of Army Wives, with it proceeds benefiting the Huachuca Arts Association, and college scholarships. Sierra Vista annexed Fort Huachuca, a U.S. military base, one of the largest employers in Arizona, and the adjacent community, in 1971.

Sierra Vista was the site of the first McDonald&#x27;s drive thru, which opened in 1975. The owner, Dave Rich, drove the innovative approach to gain the business of the soldiers from nearby Fort Huachuca. At that time, soldiers were not allowed to wear their military fatigues off of the military base with the exception of driving or riding inside vehicles.

Sierra Vista has a population of over 43,000 today. The city is the economic and commercial center of Cochise County, and northern Sonora, Mexico.

==Geography==
Sierra Vista is in southwestern Cochise County at (31.545498, −110.276500). It is bordered on the northwest by the much smaller town of Huachuca City.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water. It is above sea level. Sierra Vista is flanked on the southwest side by the Huachuca Mountains, with Miller Peak rising to and Carr Peak to , both south of the city limits. The city is accessible via Arizona State Routes 90 and 92. The San Pedro River flows just east of the city limits.

===Climate===

In the Köppen climate classification system, Sierra Vista falls within the typical cold semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;) of mid-altitude Arizona. Fall and spring, like most other parts of Arizona, are very dry. Winters are cool to cold with frosts which can occasionally be hard freezes; frost can be expected to stop in mid- to late April. Spring, like fall, spends about half of itself within the frost season. Summer starts off dry, but progressively gets wetter as the monsoon season approaches. The city has a fairly stable climate with very little humidity. However, the North American Monsoon can bring torrential rains during the months of July and August and will produce almost half the yearly rainfall in just those two months alone. Due to the dry climate the rest of the year and the city&#x27;s high elevation, daily winter low temperatures range from on average and up to on rare occasions when moist fronts bring warm air from the Gulf of California. Snow is not a common sight on the streets of Sierra Vista though some years the city can receive several inches of snow and other years it will receive none. However, a snow-capped Miller Peak and Carr Peak in the Huachuca Mountains is a common sight for four to five months every year.

The highest recorded temperature was on June 20, 2017.
The lowest recorded temperature was on February 3, 2011.
The maximum average rainfall occurs in August.

==Parks and outdoors==
===Bird watching===
Nicknamed the &quot;Hummingbird Capital of the United States&quot;, the city sees bird watchers from all over the world flock to the nearby Ramsey Canyon Preserve and other local canyons to observe and photograph hundreds of different bird species. In the Huachuca Mountains, Ramsey Canyon is one of the prime locations to see hummingbirds in the U.S. An ecological crossroads between desert and tropics, the mountains that rise from the arid surroundings of this part of southeastern Arizona trap rainfall and create island-like biodiverse areas. Among numerous other plants and animals, the Ramsey Canyon wildlife reserve is home to 15 hummingbird species. Most notable are the beryline and violet-crowned hummingbirds, which breed in Central America but only migrate as far north as the southwestern United States. Other outdoor sightseeing and recreational opportunities that are nearby include the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area, the Coronado National Memorial in the Huachuca Mountains, and Parker Canyon Lake. Excellent views of the clear night sky have led Sierra Vista to become the chosen center of amateur astronomy in Arizona, with more than a dozen well equipped amateur observatories in the area and a large observatory at the University of Arizona College of Applied Science &amp; Technology within the city limits.

===Ramsey Canyon===

Ramsey Canyon in the Huachuca Mountains was named after Gardner Ramsey after his arrival in the 1880s. Ramsey Canyon Preserve is at the end of Ramsey Canyon Road west of Arizona Highway 92. The preserve provides an excellent bird watching experience with two loop trails. The shorter loop trail is around half a mile long while the longer trail is around a mile. Two historic structures can be found along the trail. James Cabin, a log cabin dating to 1902, was built by John James on Ramsey Canyon Creek. The James House, built in 1911, is on the other side of the creek and provided a larger dwelling for the James family. Ramsey Canyon Trail is a longer (2.4 mile) trail, also known as Hamburg Trail, and is just beyond the Nature Conservancy preserve. The trail has an elevation change of 1,300 feet and enters the 20,000 acre Miller Peak Wilderness which is part of the Coronado National Forest after passing the Pat Scott Canyon and Wisconsin Canyon junction that includes the old prospecting site of Hamburg Mine.

===Carr Canyon===
Carr Canyon, named after James Carr, is accessible by the Carr Canyon Road and is a scenic drive in the Coronado National Forest. The rough road is seven miles long with only two of the seven miles paved. It was originally built by James Carr in 1881 and requires a high clearance vehicle to traverse. Carr Canyon roads ends at the Reef Townsite at an elevation of . Near the entrance of Carr Canyon is the historic Carr House, built in 1932, which is an information center operated by the Forest Service.

===Regional health concerns===
Residents and health professionals became concerned after observing an elevated number of leukemia and related childhood cancer cases being reported in Sierra Vista since 1995. In 2001, with seven reported cases since 1995, the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) determined the number of cases was statistically elevated over the expected norm. In response, the ADHS launched an environmental review of air, drinking water and soil in the Sierra Vista area to determine if environmental exposure had placed residents at greater risk of childhood leukemia or other cancers. By October 2002, the ADHS in conjunction with the Arizona Cancer Registry, determined that, &quot;No common environmental exposure from drinking water, ambient air or waste sites were identified that might have placed residents of the Sierra Vista area at greater risk of developing leukemia.&quot; No further action was recommended at that time.

In 2003, three more cases of leukemia were reported. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) was hesitant to investigate in depth, initially leaving the matter to state health departments, but became involved after the ADHS requested their assistance in the spring of 2003. The CDC concluded two formal studies, in 2004 and 2006, with mixed results. They did not discover any environmental causes for the increased incidence of leukemia, but they did note that they only tested four children with leukemia. They cautioned that with such a small number of study participants, &quot;any attempt to measure associations between environmental exposure and disease would be inherently suspect and not statistically appropriate.&quot; Biological samples were tested for 128 chemicals, with results showing average or below average levels for all chemicals except tungsten, styrene and PCB-52, which were above average.

There were no more reported cases in the several years following the CDC reports, bringing the occurrence statistics back in line with national averages. However, with a total of thirteen children diagnosed and another five potentially linked cases being investigated since 1995, some people still have concerns.

<text>Sierra Vista Southeast, often referred to as [[Hereford, Arizona|Hereford]] or [[Nicksville, Arizona|Nicksville]], is a census-designated place (CDP) in Cochise County, Arizona, United States. The population was 14,797 at the 2010 census. It includes the neighborhoods Ramsey Canyon, and Sierra Vista Estates within its boundaries.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 112.3 square miles (290.8 km2), all land.

===Climate===
In the Köppen climate classification system, Sierra Vista Southeast falls within the typical cold semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;) of mid-altitude Arizona. Fall and spring, like most other parts of Arizona, are very dry. Winters are cool to cold with frosts which can occasionally be hard freezes; frost can be expected to stop in mid- to late April. Spring, like fall, spends about half of itself within the frost season. Summer starts off dry, but progressively gets wetter as the monsoon season approaches. The city has a fairly stable climate with very little humidity. However, the North American Monsoon can bring torrential rains during the months of July and August and will produce almost half the yearly rainfall in just those two months alone. Due to the dry climate the rest of the year and the CDP&#x27;s high elevation, daily winter low temperatures range from on average and up to on rare occasions when moist fronts bring warm air from the Gulf of California. Snow is not a common sight in the CDP, though some years the city can receive several inches of snow and other years it will receive none. However, a snow-capped Miller Peak and Carr Peak in the Huachuca Mountains is a common sight for four to five months every year.

==Demographics==

<text>St. David or Saint David is a census-designated place (CDP) in Cochise County, Arizona, United States. The population was 1,699 at the 2010 census.

==History==
St. David was established as a result of the Mormon Battalion having earlier passed through the San Pedro River valley in 1846. One of the founders of St. David, Philemon C. Merrill, was a member of the battalion. The Mormon settlers of 1877 were part of a group that originally was to settle Lehi, Arizona. The town was named after David Patten Kimball. The early St. David settlers played an important role in establishing the subsequent surrounding settlements, such as Fort Huachuca and Tombstone, as they did much of the logging in the Huachuca Mountains to provide lumber for the construction of those locations.

As a tight-knit Mormon community, St. David managed better than other small towns in Cochise County during the Great Depression.

An influx of non-Mormons, principally from Oklahoma and Texas, took place when St. David became the site for Civilian Conservation Corps Camp SCS-19-A from 1935 to 1940. Works included soil erosion and flood control projects.

The first natural gas lines brought into Cochise County were brought into St. David.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

The portion of Arizona State Route 80 that runs east-west through town uses the earlier Patten Street alignment, with the center of town located at the intersection of Patten and Miller Lane.

The main crossings of the San Pedro River in St. David are at Dragoon Wash to the north west and Escalante Crossing to the south. The latter was known as upper crossing and was the site of a stagecoach station.

===Climate===
St. David has a semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;) with cool winters, hot summers, and large diurnal temperature variation throughout the year.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 1,744 people, 666 households, and 462 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 892 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 93.0% White, 0.4% Black or African American, 0.3% Native American, 0.5% Asian, 0.2% Pacific Islander, 3.0% from other races, and 2.6% from two or more races. 9.8% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 666 households, out of which 28.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 59.3% were married couples living together, 8.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 30.5% were non-families. 26.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 17.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.60 and the average family size was 3.16.

In the CDP, the age distribution of the population shows 28.3% under the age of 18, 5.4% from 18 to 24, 18.2% from 25 to 44, 23.3% from 45 to 64, and 24.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 44 years. For every 100 females, there were 96.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 98.6 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $30,840, and the median income for a family was $32,292. Males had a median income of $31,641 versus $21,339 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $12,872. About 8.7% of families and 12.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 13.6% of those under age 18 and 3.8% of those age 65 or over.

==Education==
In 1878 a one-room schoolhouse was built from stone, but it was destroyed in the 1887 Sonora earthquake. The 500-pound bell from that schoolhouse is now on display at the current school. In 1938 a brick schoolhouse was built, it still stands today and is on the National Register of Historic Places. It is one of the oldest standing structures in the area. The St. David School District is also the oldest in the San Pedro Valley. The annual San Pedro Valley Fair has been held at the St. David High School since 1934. In 2008 St. David held a celebration its 130 anniversary during the 75th San Pedro Valley Fair with a Town Reunion at the St. David School. Another popular cultural event held at the school is the annual 1880s Historic Costume Ball, which is patterned after a typical postbellum Indian War-era military ball.

<text>Tombstone is a city in Cochise County, Arizona, United States, founded in 1879 by prospector Ed Schieffelin in what was then Pima County, Arizona Territory. It became one of the last boomtowns in the American frontier. The town grew significantly into the mid-1880s as the local mines produced $40 to $85 million in silver bullion, the largest productive silver district in Arizona. Its population grew from 100 to around 14,000 in less than seven years. It is best known as the site of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and draws most of its revenue from tourism. The city had a permanent population of 1,308, according to the 2020 census.

==History==
The town was established on Goose Flats, a mesa above the Goodenough Mine. Within two years of its founding, although far distant from any other metropolitan area, Tombstone had a bowling alley, four churches, an ice house, a school, two banks, three newspapers, and an ice-cream parlor, alongside 110 saloons, 14 gambling halls, and numerous dance halls and brothels. All of these businesses were situated among and atop many silver mines. The gentlemen and ladies of Tombstone attended operas presented by visiting acting troupes at the Schieffelin Hall opera house, while the miners and cowboys saw shows at the Bird Cage Theatre and brothel.

Under the surface were tensions that grew into deadly conflict. The mining capitalists and the townspeople were largely Republicans from the Northern states. Many of the ranchers (some of whom—like the Clantons—were also rustlers or other criminal varieties) were Confederate sympathizers and Democrats. The booming city was only from the U.S.–Mexico border and was an open market for cattle stolen from ranches in Sonora, Mexico, by a loosely organized band of outlaws known as The Cowboys. The Earp brothers—Wyatt, Virgil and Morgan—as well as Doc Holliday, arrived in December 1879 and mid-1880. The Earps had ongoing conflicts with Cowboys Ike and Billy Clanton, Frank and Tom McLaury, and Billy Claiborne. The Cowboys repeatedly threatened the Earps over many months until the conflict escalated into a shootout on October 26, 1881. The historic gunfight is often portrayed as occurring at the O.K. Corral, though it actually occurred a short distance away in an empty lot on Fremont Street.

In the mid-1880s, the silver mines penetrated the water table and the mining companies made significant investments in specialized pumps. A fire in 1886 destroyed the Grand Central hoist and the pumping plant, and it was deemed unprofitable to rebuild the costly pumps. The city nearly became a ghost town, saved only because it was the Cochise County seat until 1929. The city&#x27;s population dwindled to a low of 646 in 1910, but grew to 1,380 by 2010. Tombstone has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names.


===Native Americans===
For over 2,000 years, the Hohokam culture lived in southern Arizona, including what is now Tombstone.

===Founding===
Ed Schieffelin was briefly a scout for the U. S. Army headquartered at Camp Huachuca. Schieffelin frequently searched the wilderness looking for valuable ore samples. At the Santa Rita mines in nearby Santa Cruz Valley, three superintendents had been killed by Native Americans. When friend and fellow Army Scout Al Sieber learned what Schieffelin was up to, he is quoted as telling him, &quot;The only rock you will find out there will be your own tombstone&quot;, or, according to an earlier version of the story, &quot;Better take your coffin with you; you will find your tombstone there, and nothing else.&quot;

In 1877, Schieffelin used Brunckow&#x27;s Cabin as a base of operations to survey the country. After many months, while working the hills east of the San Pedro River, he found pieces of silver ore in a dry wash on a high plateau called Goose Flats. It took him several more months to find the source. When he located the vein, he estimated it to be fifty feet long and twelve inches wide. Schieffelin took on a partner named William Griffith who financed the filing of the claim in return for a later claim for himself. Griffith filed Schieffelin&#x27;s first claim, which was named Tombstone, on September 3, 1877. Another account says the first claim was called Graveyard &quot;because it proved worthless and for no other reason.&quot;

When the first claims were filed, the initial settlement of tents and wooden shacks was located at Watervale, near the Lucky Cuss mine, with a population of about 100. The Goodenough Mine strike occurred shortly after. Former Territorial Governor Anson P. K. Safford offered financial backing for a share of the mining claims, and Schieffelin, his brother Al, and their partner Richard Gird formed the Tombstone Mining and Milling Company and built a stamp mill near the San Pedro River, about away. As the mill was being built, U.S. Deputy Mineral Surveyor Solon M. Allis finished surveying the new town&#x27;s site in March 1879. The tents and shacks near the Lucky Cuss were moved to the new town site on Goose Flats, a mesa above the Goodenough Mine at above sea level and large enough to hold a growing town. Lots were immediately sold on Allen Street for $5.00 each. The town soon had some 40 cabins and about 100 residents. At the town&#x27;s founding in March 1879, it took its name from Schieffelin&#x27;s initial mining claim. By fall 1879, a few thousand hardy souls were living in a canvas and matchstick camp perched amidst the richest silver strike in the Arizona Territory.

When Cochise County was formed from the eastern portion of Pima County on February 1, 1881, Tombstone became the new county seat. Telegraph service to the town was established that same month. In early March 1880, the Schieffelins&#x27; Tombstone Mining and Milling Company which owned the original Goodenough Mine and the nearby Tough Nut Mine (among others), was sold to investors from Philadelphia. Two months later, it was reported that the Tough Nut Mine was working a vein of silver ore across that assayed at $170 per ton, with some ore assaying at $22,000 a ton.

On September 9, 1880, the richly appointed Grand Hotel was opened, adorned with fine oil paintings, thick Brussels carpets, toilet stands, elegant chandeliers, silk-covered furniture, walnut furniture, and a kitchen with hot and cold running water. At the height of the silver mining boom, when the population was about 10,000, the city was host to Kelly&#x27;s Wine House, featuring 26 varieties of wine imported from Europe, a beer imported from Colorado named &quot;Coors&quot;, cigars, a bowling alley, and many other amenities common to large cities.

===Early conflicts===

Under the surface were other tensions aggravating the simmering distrust. Most of the Cowboys were Confederate sympathizers and Democrats from Southern states, especially Texas. The mine and business owners, miners, townspeople and city lawmen including the Earps were largely Republicans from the Northern states. There was also the fundamental conflict over resources and land, with traditional, Southern-style &quot;small government&quot; agrarianism of the rural Cowboys contrasted to Northern-style &quot;big-government&quot; development.

In the early 1880s, smuggling and theft of cattle, alcohol, and tobacco across the U.S./Mexico border about from Tombstone were common. The Mexican government taxed these items heavily and smugglers earned a handsome profit by sneaking these products across the border. The illegal cross-border smuggling contributed to the lawlessness of the region. Many of these crimes were carried out by outlaw elements labeled &quot;Cow-boys&quot;, a loosely organized band of friends and acquaintances who teamed up for various crimes and came to each other&#x27;s aid. The &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; wrote in an editorial, &quot;Cowboys [are] the most reckless class of outlaws in that wild country...infinitely worse than the ordinary robber.&quot; At that time during the 1880s in Cochise County it was an insult to call a legitimate cattleman a &quot;Cowboy&quot;. Legitimate cowmen were referred to as cattle herders or ranchers. The Cowboys were nonetheless welcome in town because of their free-spending habits, but shootings were common.

===Gunfight at the O.K. Corral===
On the evening of March 15, 1881, three Cochise County Cowboys attempted to rob a Kinnear &amp; Company stagecoach carrying $26,000 in silver bullion , en route from Tombstone to Benson, Arizona, the nearest railroad freight terminal.

Near Drew&#x27;s Station, just outside Contention City, the stage was attacked. Eli &quot;Budd&quot; Philpot, a popular and well-known driver. and a passenger named Peter Roerig riding in the rear dickey seat were both shot and killed. Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp, with his temporary deputies and brothers Wyatt Earp and Morgan Earp, pursued the Cowboys suspected of the murders. That set off a chain of events that culminated, on October 26, 1881, in a gunfight in a vacant lot owned by photographer C. S. Fly near, but not in or at, the O.K. Corral, during which the lawmen and Doc Holliday killed Tom McLaury, Frank McLaury, and Billy Clanton.

The gunfight was the result of a personal, family, and political feud. Two months later, on the evening of December 28, 1881, Virgil Earp was ambushed and seriously wounded on the streets of Tombstone by hidden assailants shooting from the second story of an unfinished building. Although identified, the suspects provided witnesses who supplied alibis, and the men were not prosecuted. On March 18, 1882, while Morgan Earp was playing billiards at 10 p.m. at Campbell &amp; Hatch in Allen Street—in the heart of Tombstone&#x27;s still-current downtown—he was killed by a shot through a window that struck his spine, as Wyatt looked on. Once again, the assailants were named but escaped arrest due to legal technicalities. Wyatt Earp concluded that official justice was out of reach. Armed with warrants obtained via the U. S. Marshal&#x27;s Office, he led a posse of US deputy marshals on what became known as the Earp Vendetta Ride, pursuing and killing four of the men they held responsible.

Much of the Cowboy-related crime subsided after the Earp family left Arizona in early 1882, following the attempted murder of Tombstone Marshal Virgil Earp on December 28, 1881, and the murder of Deputy Marshal Morgan Earp on March 18, 1882. John Slaughter was elected Cochise County Sheriff in 1886 and served two terms. He hired Burt Alvord, who as a 15-year-old boy had witnessed the shootout between the Earps and Cowboys. Alford served very effectively for three years until he began to drink heavily and associate with outlaws, as had Earp-era County Sheriff Johnny Behan, a close friend and constant protector of the law-breaking Clanton family and their friends.

===Boothill Graveyard===
Tom McLaury, Frank McLaury, and Billy Clanton, killed in the O.K. Corral shootout, are among those buried in the town&#x27;s Boothill Graveyard. Of the number of pioneer Boot Hill cemeteries in the Old West, so named because most of those buried in them had &quot;died with their boots on&quot;, Boothill in Tombstone is one of the best-known.

===Silver mining===
Tombstone boomed, but founder Ed Schieffelin was more interested in prospecting than owning a mine. Ed was one-third partners with his brother Al Schieffelin and Richard Gird. There were several hundred mining claims near Tombstone, although the most productive were immediately south of town. These included the Goodenough, Toughnut, Contention, Grand Central, Lucky Cuss, Emerald, and Silver Thread. Due to the lack of readily available water near town, mills were built along the San Pedro River about away, leading to the establishment of several small mill towns, including Charleston, Contention City, and Fairbank.

Schieffelin left Tombstone to find more ore and when he returned four months later, Gird had lined up buyers for their interest in the Contention claim, which they sold for $10,000. It would later yield millions in silver. They sold a half-interest in the Lucky Cuss, and the other half turned into a steady stream of money. Al and Ed Schieffelin later sold their two-thirds interest in the Tough Nut for $1 million, and sometime later Gird sold his one-third interest for the same amount.
There are widely varying estimates of the value of gold and silver mined during the course of Tombstone&#x27;s history. The Tombstone mines produced 32 million troy ounces (1,000 metric tons) of silver, more than any other mining district in Arizona. In 1883, writer Patrick Hamilton estimated that during the first four years of activity the mines produced about US$25,000,000 (approximately $ today). Other estimates include US$40 to US$85 million (about $ to $ today). Renewed mining is planned for the area.

One of the byproducts of the vast riches being produced, lawsuits became very prevalent. Between 1880 and 1885 the courts were clogged with many cases, often about land claims and properties. As a result, lawyers began to settle in Tombstone and became even wealthier than the miners and those who financed the mining. In addition, because many of the lawsuits required expert analysis of the underground, many geologists and engineers found employment in Tombstone and settled there. In the end, a thorough mapping of the area was completed by experts which resulted in maps documenting Tombstone&#x27;s mining claims better than any other mining district of the West.

Mining was an easy task at Tombstone in the early days, ore being rich and close to the surface. One man could pull out ore equal to what three men produced elsewhere. Some residents of Tombstone became quite wealthy and spent considerable money during its boom years. Tombstone&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Nugget&quot;, was established in the fall of 1879. &quot;The Tombstone Epitaph&quot; was founded on May 1, 1880. As the fastest growing boomtown in the American Southwest, the silver industry and attendant wealth attracted many professionals and merchants who brought their wives and families. With them came churches and ministers. They brought a Victorian sensibility and became the town&#x27;s elite. Many citizens of Tombstone dressed well, and up-to-date fashion could be seen in this growing mining town. Visitors expressed their amazement at the quality and diversity of products that were readily available in the area. The men who worked the mines were largely European immigrants. The Chinese did the town&#x27;s laundry and provided other services. The Cowboys ran the countryside and stole cattle from haciendas across the international border in Sonora, Mexico.

When the railroad was not built into Tombstone as had been planned, the increasingly sophisticated city of Tombstone remained relatively isolated, deep in a Federal territory that was largely an unpopulated desert and wilderness. Tombstone and its surrounding countryside also became known as one of the deadliest regions in the West. Water was hauled in until the Huachuca Water Company, funded in part by investors like Dr. George E. Goodfellow, built a pipeline from the Huachuca Mountains in 1881. No sooner was a pipeline completed than Tombstone&#x27;s silver mines struck water.

===City growth and decline===

By mid-1881, the town had fancy restaurants, Vogan&#x27;s Bowling Alley, four churches—Catholic, Episcopal, Presbyterian, and Methodist—an ice house, a school, the Schieffelin Hall opera house, two banks, three newspapers, and an ice cream parlor, alongside 110 saloons, 14 gambling halls, several Chinese restaurants, French, two Italian, numerous Mexican, several upscale &quot;Continental&quot; establishments, and many &quot;home cooking&quot; hot spots including Nellie Cashman&#x27;s famous Rush House and numerous brothels all situated among and on top of a number of dirty, hardscrabble mines. The Arizona Telephone Company began installing poles and lines for the city&#x27;s first telephone service on March 15, 1881.

Investors from the northeastern United States bought many of the leading mining operations. The mining itself was carried out by immigrants from Europe, chiefly Cornwall, Ireland, and Germany. Chinese and Mexican labor provided services including laundry, construction, restaurants, and hotels, but immigrant labor provoked backlash; an &quot;Anti-Chinese League&quot; was formed in the 1880s to boycott Chinese businesses and workers.

The mines and stamping mills ran three shifts. Miners were paid union wages of $4.00 per day working six 10-hour shifts per week. The roughly 6,000 men working in Tombstone generated more than $168,000 a week (around $ today) in income. The mostly young, single, male population spent their hard-earned cash on Allen Street, the major commercial center, open 24 hours a day.

The respectable folks saw traveling theater shows at Schieffelin Hall, opened on June 8, 1881. On December 25, 1881, the Bird Cage Theatre opened on Allen Street, offering the miners and cowboys their kind of bawdy entertainment. One of the prime entertainments at the Bird Cage Theatre was Cornish wrestling competitions, with the results being regularly published in the UK.

In 1882, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;the Bird Cage Theatre is the wildest, wickedest night spot between Basin Street and the Barbary Coast.&quot; The Bird Cage remained open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year until it closed its doors in 1889. Respectable women stayed on the north side of Allen Street. The prostitutes worked the saloons on the south side and in the southeast quarter of the town, as far as possible from the proper residential section north of Fremont Street.

By late 1881, Tombstone had more than 7,000 citizens, excluding all Chinese, Mexicans, women, and children residents. At the height of the town&#x27;s boom, the official population reached about 10,000, with several thousand more uncounted. In 1882, the Cochise County Courthouse was built at a cost around $45,000.

===Fires===

Due to poor building practices and poor fire protection common to boomtown construction, Tombstone was hit by two major fires. On June 22, 1881, the first fire destroyed the 66 businesses making up the eastern half of the business district. The fire began when a lit cigar ignited a barrel of whiskey in the Arcade Saloon.

On May 25, 1882, another, more destructive fire started in a Chinese laundry on Fifth Street between Toughnut and Allen Streets. It destroyed the Grand Hotel and the Tivoli Saloon before it jumped Fremont Street, destroying more than 100 businesses and most of the business district. Lacking enough water to put out the flames, buildings in the fire&#x27;s path were dynamited to deny the fire fuel. Total damages were estimated to be $700,000, far more than the estimated $250,000 insurance coverage, but rebuilding started right away, nonetheless.

In March 1883, along one short stretch of Allen Street, drinking establishments were available in two of the principal hotels, Eagle Brewery, Cancan Chop-House, French Rotisserie, Alhambra, Maison Dore, City of Paris, Brown&#x27;s Saloon, Fashion Saloon, Miners&#x27; Home, Kelly&#x27;s Wine-House, the Grotto, the Tivoli, and two more unnamed saloons.

===Mines strike water===
The Tough Nut Mine first experienced seepage in 1880. In March 1881, the Sulphuret Mine struck water at . A year later, in March 1882, miners in a new shaft of the Grand Central Mine hit water at . The flow was not at first large enough to stop work, but experienced miners thought the water flow would increase, and it did. Soon, constant pumping with a pump was insufficient. The silver ore deposits they sought were soon under water.

Several mine managers traveled to San Francisco and met with the principal owners of the Contention Mine. They talked about options for draining the mines, and found the only system available for pumping water out of mines below was the Cornish engine, which had been used at the Comstock Lode in the 1870s. They bought and installed the huge Cornish engines in the Contention and Grand Central mines. By mid-February 1884, the engines were removing of water every 24 hours. The city merchants celebrated the continued success of mining and the transfer of funds to their businesses. The Contention and the Grand Central found that their pumps were draining the mining district, benefiting other mines as well, but the other companies refused to pay a proportion of the expense.

On May 26, 1886, the Grand Central hoist and pumping plant burned. The fire was so intense that the metal components of the Cornish engine melted and warped. The headworks of the main mine shaft were also destroyed. Shortly afterward, the price of silver slid to 90 cents an ounce. The mines that remained operational laid off workers. Individuals who had thought about leaving Tombstone when the mine flooding started now took action. The price of silver briefly recovered for a while and a few mines began producing again, but never at the level reached in the early 1880s.

==Tourism==
The U.S. census recorded fewer than 1,900 residents in 1890 and fewer than 700 residents in 1900. Tombstone was saved from becoming a ghost town partly because it remained the Cochise County seat until 1929, when county residents voted to move county offices to nearby Bisbee. The classic Cochise County Courthouse and adjacent gallows yard in Tombstone are preserved as a museum. 

Town life was rather quiet in the 1930s and 1940s, but the town received renewed interest in the 1950s and 1960s due to portrayals in comics, movies, television, and film. Currently, tourism and western memorabilia are the main commercial enterprises; a July 2005 CNN article noted that Tombstone receives approximately 450,000 tourist visitors each year. This is about 300 tourists/year for each permanent resident. In contrast to its heyday, when it featured saloons open 24 hours and numerous houses of prostitution, Tombstone is now a staid community with few businesses open late. Tombstone and surrounding areas have a variety of lodging options, restaurants, and attractions. The town is located near other historic sites of interest, including Bisbee and the San Pedro Riparian area. Tombstone is a short drive away from Sierra Vista, which is considered the shopping hub of Cochise County.

East Allen Street is the center of Tombstone&#x27;s tourist attractions, featuring three blocks of shaded boardwalks lined with gift shops, saloons, and eateries. Allen Street&#x27;s historic district is closed to motor traffic from 3rd Street, the location of the city park and OK Corral, to 6th Street, where the Bird Cage Theatre is located. Additional sites of interest can be found throughout the city, even out on Highway 80, where Boothill Cemetery is found.

===Performance events===

Performance events help preserve the town&#x27;s Wild West image and expose it to new visitors. The historic O.K. Corral has been preserved, but is now surrounded by a wall. Fremont Street (modern Arizona Highway 80), where portions of the gunfight took place, is open to the public. Mannequins are used to depict the location of the participants as recorded by Wyatt Earp. Visitors may pay to see a re-enactment of the gunfight. Helldorado Days, Tombstone&#x27;s oldest festival, celebrates the community&#x27;s wild days of the 1880s.
===World&#x27;s largest rosebush===

According to Guinness, the world&#x27;s largest rosebush was planted in Tombstone in 1885 and still flourishes in the city&#x27;s sunny climate. The Lady Banksia rose originated in Scotland. Mary Gee was the wife of mining engineer Henry Gee, who worked for the Vizina Mining Co. Mary&#x27;s family sent the homesick bride a box of rooted cuttings from her home country. She planted one of the roses by the patio of the Vizina Mining Company&#x27;s boarding house, the first adobe building in town, located at 4th and Toughnut Streets across from the later site of the railroad depot. Henry and she lived in the boarding house when they first arrived in Tombstone.

The building was later renamed the Cochise House Hotel, and from 1909 to 1936, it was known as the Arcade Hotel. By the 1930s, the rosebush had grown to shade the entire patio and became a popular site for tourists. The hotel was later renamed the Rose Tree Inn and then the Rose Tree Inn Museum. The museum curator tells visitors that all Banksia roses growing in the U.S. today are descendants of the Tombstone rose.

In 1940, the Lady Banksia rose covered about . , the rosebush covered more than of the roof and garden trellis of the inn, and has a circumference trunk. The rosebush is walled off, and the inn charges admission to view it.

A pair of huge rose &quot;trees&quot; of more than in circumference, also planted in the 1880s, shade a courtyard at Tombstone&#x27;s historic Sacred Heart Church.

==Historic district==
The Tombstone Historic District is a National Historic Landmark District. The town&#x27;s focus on tourism has threatened the town&#x27;s designation as a National Historic Landmark District, a designation it earned in 1961 as &quot;one of the best preserved specimens of the rugged frontier town of the 1870s and &#x27;80s&quot;. In 2004, the National Park Service declared that Tombstone&#x27;s historic designation was threatened, and asked the community to develop an appropriate stewardship program.
The National Park Service noted inappropriate alterations to the district included:
* Placing &quot;historic&quot; dates on new buildings
* Failing to distinguish new construction from historic structures
* Covering authentic historic elevations with inappropriate materials
* Replacing historic features instead of repairing them
* Replacing missing historic features with conjectural and unsubstantiated materials
* Building incompatible additions to existing historic structures and new incompatible buildings within the historic district
* Using illuminated signage, including blinking lights surrounding historic signs
* Installing hitching rails and Spanish tile-covered store porches when such architectural features never existed within Tombstone

Historical buildings include Schieffelin Hall, the opera house built by Al Schieffelin in 1881, and the Cochise County Courthouse. The courthouse was largely unused and then vacant after the county seat was moved to Bisbee. An attempt was made to turn it into hotel in the 1940s, and when that failed it stood empty until 1955. The Tombstone Restoration Commission acquired the courthouse and developed it as a historical museum that opened in 1959. It features exhibits and thousands of artifacts documenting Tombstone&#x27;s past.

The Crystal Palace Saloon, including its long mahogany bar, was rebuilt based on photographs of the original saloon was restored in May 1964 to its 1881 condition. This included large Victorian ceiling lamps and the inlaid‐patterned wood floor.

==Geography and geology==

The Tombstone District located at (31.715940, −110.064827) sits atop a mesa (elevation ) in the San Pedro River valley between the Huachuca Mountains and Whetstone Mountains to the west, and the Mules and the Dragoon Mountains to the east. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

The silver-bearing Tombstone Hills around the city are caused by a local intrusion of porphyry through a limestone capping. When actively mined, the silver vein of argentiferous galena (silver-bearing lead ore) was large and well defined. The silver and lead were easily milled and smelted. The lead content sometimes was as much as 50% of the ore, and assays proved the silver content ran as high as $105.00 per ton in 1881 dollars.

The underlying basement rocks are fine-grained Pinal schist, which is intruded by gneissic granite. The outcrop is in a small area south of the principal mines. The overlying Paleozoic quartzite and limestones rocks lie on an unconformity with a total thickness ranging from , and contains of Mississippian Escabrosa limestone and the Naco Formation limestone of Pennsylvanian age in the upper formations.

Overlying the Naco limestone is an unconformable Mesozoic series of conglomerate, thick-bedded quartzites and shales, with two or three lenses of soft, bluish-gray limestone. Into these formations intruded large bodies of quartz monzonite and by dikes of quartz monzonite-porphyry and diorite-porphyry. Structural faulting occurs throughout the district, especially immediately south of Tombstone, where the strata are closely folded.

Tombstone District ores have been produced geologically in three or more ways. They may have been formed in argentiferous (silver-bearing) lead sulfide containing spotty amounts of copper and zinc. These deposits are usually deeply oxidized and enriched by irregular replacement bodies along mineralized fissure zones and anticlinal rolls cut by Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary formations. Ore bodies are often closely associated with newer cross-cutting intrusive dikes of laramide. Ore deposits were formed by base metal mineralization occurring with oxidation found in fault and fracture zones in laramide volcanics and quartz latite porphyry intrusives. Silver ore also occurred in manganese oxides with some argentiferous deposits in lenticular or pipe-like replacement bodies along fracture and fault zones, usually in Pennsylvanian-Permian age Naco Group limestones.

==Climate==
Tombstone has a typical Arizona semiarid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;/&quot;BSh&quot;) with three basic seasons. Winter, from October to March, features mild to warm days and chilly nights, with minima falling to under on 28.4 nights, although snowfall is almost unknown, with the median being zero and the heaviest monthly fall being in January 1916, of which fell on January 16. The coldest temperature record in Tombstone has been on December 8, 1978.

The summer season from April to June is extremely dry and gradually heats up – the hottest temperature on record being on July 4, 1989 – before the monsoon season from July to September brings the heaviest rainfall, averaging out of an annual total of . The wettest month has been July 2008, when fell and 15 days had at least of rainfall – though the record for the most such days in a month stands at 18, in July 1930. Since 1893, the wettest calendar year has been 1905, with and the driest was 1924, with .

==Historic properties==

Several properties in Tombstone have been included in the National Register of Historic Places. The following are images of some of these properties:
== &quot;China Mary&quot; ==
During the 1880s, Tombstone had a population of about 500 Chinese. One of the most prominent members of Tombstone&#x27;s Chinese community was Sing Choy (or Ah Chum), a woman popularly nicknamed &quot;China Mary&quot;. Her role as a community leader included operating a store, controlling opium dens and gambling, and securing jobs for Chinese laborers in the White community.

She died in December 1906 from heart failure, and was buried in Tombstone&#x27;s Boot Hill Cemetery. She was portrayed in an episode of the 1955 television series &quot;The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot; by Chinese-American actress Anna May Wong.

<text>Willcox is a city in Cochise County, Arizona, United States. The city is located in the Sulphur Springs Valley, a flat and sparsely populated drainage basin dotted with seasonal lakes. The city is surrounded by Arizona&#x27;s most prominent mountain ranges, including the Pinaleño Mountains and the Chiricahua Mountains.

Six of Arizona&#x27;s ten largest mountains are located within a 70-mile radius including Mount Graham (31 miles north), which is Arizona&#x27;s most prominent mountain, Chiricahua Peak (42 miles southeast), Mount Lemmon (57 miles west), Miller Peak (65 miles southwest), Mica Mountain (41 miles west), and Mount Wrightson (70 miles southwest). Scores of birds, including sandhill cranes, winter in the area, with some migrating from as far away as Siberia. A very large dry lakebed, the Willcox Playa, is located five miles south of the city. It is the remnant of the Ice Age-era Lake Cochise.

Willcox&#x27;s high desert climate gives it large diurnal temperature variation, making it ideal for wine cultivation.

==History==
Originally known as &quot;Maley&quot;, the town was founded in 1880 as a whistlestop on the Southern Pacific Railroad because of its position approximately halfway between El Paso, Texas and Phoenix, Arizona. It was renamed in honor of a visit by General Orlando B. Willcox in 1889. In the early 20th century, Willcox was a national leader in cattle production. Agriculture remains important to the local economy, but Interstate 10 has replaced the railroad as the major transportation link, and much of the economy is now tied to the highway, which runs immediately north of the town.

Willcox is the birthplace of Rex Allen, known as &quot;The Arizona Cowboy&quot;, who wrote and recorded many songs, starred in several Westerns during the early 1950s and in the syndicated television series &quot;Frontier Doctor&quot; (1958–1959). Parts of the 1993 American neo-noir film &quot;Red Rock West&quot; starring Nicolas Cage, Lara Flynn Boyle, J. T. Walsh and Dennis Hopper were filmed in Willcox. A short film documentary called &quot;Lonesome Willcox&quot; released in 2018 documented the town&#x27;s country music radio station KHIL.

Willcox became Arizona&#x27;s second federally designated wine growing region in 2016.

==Geography==
Willcox is located in northern Cochise County, in the Sulphur Springs Valley. Interstate 10 serves the city with three exits and leads southwest to Benson and east to Lordsburg, New Mexico. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.13%, is water.

=== Notable Mountains ===
==Climate==

Willcox&#x27;s high elevation gives it a milder climate than the nearby Valley of the Sun and Sonoran Desert. It also receives more rainfall than Tucson and Phoenix due to the summer monsoon rains and thus it has a cold semi-arid climate (Koppen: BSk).

==Economy==
Willcox&#x27;s primary industries are agriculture, wine production, and tourism.

Major employers in Willcox include Riverview LLP, NatureSweet greenhouse, Northern Cochise Community Hospital, Valley Telephone Cooperative, the Border Patrol, Safeway, and Willcox Unified School District.

The wine industry employs over 400 people in the region. The agricultural producers in the area employ many hundreds of workers as well.

===Wine country===
The Willcox wine region produces 74 percent of the wine grapes grown in the state of Arizona. Willcox is the largest-grape growing region in Arizona and grows more wine grapes than any other region in the state and offers a wide variety of wines to choose from. Grape varietals grown include Petite Sirah, Malvasia Bianca, Sangiovese, Chenin blanc, Syrah, Colombard, Sauvignon blanc, Corvina, Merlot, Malbec, Tannat, Cabernet Franc, Chardonnay, Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon and Mourvèdre.

==Arts, events, culture==
Willcox has two festival seasons in the spring and fall.

Spring events include the Willcox Wine Country Spring Festival, which takes place the third weekend of May, and the Willcox West Fest in April.

Fall events include Rex Allen Days, which is a multi-day event that takes place the first weekend in October, the Willcox Wine Country Fall Festival, which takes place the 3rd weekend of October, the Willcox Flyer Bike Ride, which takes place the first Saturday of September, and the BoulderDash 13k/30k, which takes place in mid-October.

Winter festivals include the Christmas Light Parade and Craft Fair in December, and Wings Over Willcox Birding Festival which takes place over Martin Luther King Jr. Weekend.

<doc id="106593" wikidata="Q1856057" url="?curid=106593" title="Leupp, Arizona">
<text>Leupp () is a census-designated place (CDP) in Coconino County, Arizona, on the Navajo Nation, United States. The population was 951 at the 2010 census.

In 1902 an Indian boarding school was constructed here, administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. It had been closed before the US entry into World War II. In 1942 the facility was converted for use as the Leupp Isolation Center, designed to detain Japanese and Japanese-American internees from the several larger internment camps established by the War Relocation Authority to hold citizens and immigrants from the West Coast. They were sent here if characterized as troublemakers; some were men trying to regain their rights as American citizens.

==History==

The Navajo and their ancestors occupied this area for thousands of years. In 1868 they were forced by the United States to agree to a reservation, which was within the New Mexico Territory until 1912. After Arizona and New Mexico were admitted as states, the reservation extended across their common border.

In 1902, the Bureau of Indian Affairs established an Indian boarding school in Leupp, to serve Navajo and other Native American children in the large region. The population was spread out too far for most children to be able to commute to the school, so they lived as boarders at the BIA school. Soon afterward, the school was moved to a new location known as Old Leupp. Old Leupp is a few miles to the southeast of Leupp.

In 1907, Leupp was designated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs as the headquarters of the Leupp Indian Land. The BIA had an office at Leupp. This was one of five Navajo Indian Lands that existed before 1936, when the nation reorganized under a constitutional government.
* Leupp Trading Post
In 1910, John Walker built the Leupp Trading Post from quarried sandstone at the newly established community now called &quot;Old Leupp&quot;. The BIA had begun building its agency headquarters there for this part of the Navajo lands. By 1912, Walker sold the post to an unknown party.

In 1929 Stanton K. Borum and his wife Ida Mae became owners of the Leupp Trading Post. They added to the original structure, creating a two-story structure: the Trading Post was on the ground floor and their residence on the second floor.

In 1944 William E. and Lucile McGee, who had been in the trading post business since 1923, purchased Leupp Trading Post from Ida Mae Borum. After William and Lucile retired in 1968, their son, Ralph, and his wife, Ellen, took over the business, running the Leupp Trading Post until 1982.

In the late 20th century, the trading post was closed. The building was dismantled so that its materials could be used elsewhere. Nothing other than the foundation remains.

==World War II==

Choctaw and Cherokee American soldiers served as code talkers in Europe during World War I, also known as the Great War. Germans were known to have sent people to the US in the postwar period to learn these languages before World War II broke out, so the US did not repeat using code talkers from these tribes in Europe.

Philip Johnston was a European American who had grown up in the Leupp area with his missionary parents, where he learned some Navajo. As an engineer in World War II, he suggested to the Marines to use the Navajo language as a code against the Japanese. He knew how impenetrable and complex the language was, making it nearly impossible for an outsider to learn easily. The Navajo language is so complex with its dialect and sentence structure that it would take code talkers minutes to successfully translate and transmit and then re-translate the message. But this effort would have taken hours for soldiers trained in other codes to complete. Had it not been for growing up in this area, Johnston probably would have never interacted with the Navajo people and learned the language, and the Navajo code talkers may not have been used. Their effort is believed to have helped the US in the war immeasurably. Their code, based on Navajo, was unbreakable until the US government released the top-secret files years later.

===Leupp Isolation Center===
During World War II, the US Army took over the abandoned Bureau of Indian Affairs boarding school in Leupp to use as the Leupp Isolation Center, for Japanese American internees considered &quot;troublemakers&quot; by authorities at other internment camps. The first inmates were transferred from Manzanar Isolation Center, which had preceded the use of Leupp for this purpose. In December 1942 a clash had taken place between camp guards and several hundred Japanese-American internees. Two prisoners were killed, and nine prisoners and one guard were injured.

The 16 men suspected as having instigated the protests were removed from camp and placed in surrounding town jails. While they were held in jail (without being charged with a crime or allowed a hearing), War Relocation Authority officials converted a former Civilian Conservation Corps camp outside Moab, Utah, into a temporary isolation center for &quot;noncompliant&quot; Japanese Americans. The 16 men from Manzanar arrived in Moab on January 11, 1943. Over the next three months, another 25 &quot;troublemakers&quot;—mostly men who had resisted the WRA&#x27;s attempts to assess the loyalty of incarcerated Japanese Americans by asking them to take a poorly worded oath—were brought to Moab. On April 27 most of the population was transferred to Leupp. (Five men, serving sentences in the nearby county jail after protesting conditions in the isolation center, were transported to Leupp in a five-by-six-foot box on the back of a truck. Their separate transportation was arranged by Moab director Francis Frederick, who had also sentenced them for &quot;unlawful assembly.&quot;)

Additional internees were sent here from Tule Lake, Topaz and other camps. Leupp housed a population of approximately 50–60 prisoners at a time, with a total of 80 Japanese Americans passing through the isolation center while it operated. The 52 inmates then residing in Leupp were transferred to the stockade at Tule Lake (converted to a segregation center for &quot;disloyal&quot; Japanese Americans earlier that year) on December 2, 1943. The camp technically remained open, retained with minimal maintenance, until September 20, 1944. On that date it was returned to Department of the Interior authority.

The city was originally called Government Camp, but was later named for John C. Page, commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation, 1936–1943.

After the dam was completed in 1966, Page officially incorporated as a town on March 1, 1975. The city grew steadily to today&#x27;s population over 7,000. Because of the new roads and bridge built for use during construction, it has become the gateway to the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and Lake Powell, attracting more than 3 million visitors per year. Page is also the home of two of the largest electrical generation units in the western United States. Glen Canyon Dam has a 1,288,000-kilowatt capacity when fully online. The other power plant to the southeast is the Navajo Generating Station, which ceased operations in 2019. It was a coal-fired steam plant with an output capability of 2,250,000 kilowatts. On December 18, 2020, the three smokestacks of the Navajo Generating Station were demolished.

In 1997, Antelope Canyon was opened to tourism on Navajo land adjacent to Page. This natural slot canyon, formed by erosion, created a increased tourism for Page.

<doc id="106599" wikidata="Q3476581" url="?curid=106599" title="Supai, Arizona">
<text>Supai () is a census-designated place (CDP) in Coconino County, Arizona, United States, within the Grand Canyon.

As of the 2010 census, the CDP had a population of 208. The capital of the Havasupai Indian Reservation, Supai is the only place in the United States where mail is still carried in and out by mules.

Supai has been referred to as &quot;the most remote community&quot; in the contiguous United States by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It is accessible only by helicopter, on foot or by mule. Supai is from the nearest road and has no automobiles in the community.

==History==
In 1910 there was a flood of Supai which affected the town.

In the 1960s Martin Goodfriend, a tourist, began to advocate for the Supai people, and a columnist of the &quot;Arizona Republic&quot;, Don Dedera, wrote articles about Goodfriend&#x27;s findings. Dedera stated that Goodfriend countered a view that Supai was a kind of &quot;Shangri-la&quot;.

Tourists and some residents were evacuated from Supai and surrounding area on August 17 and 18, 2008, due to flooding of Havasu Creek complicated by the failure of the earthen Redlands Dam (subsequent to the main flooding event) after a night of heavy rainfall. Evacuees were taken to Peach Springs, Arizona. More heavy rains were expected and a flash flood warning was put into effect, necessitating the evacuation, according to the National Park Service. The floods were significant enough to attract coverage from international media.

Damage to the trails, bridges, and campground was severe enough for Havasupai to close visitor access to the village, campground, and falls until the spring of 2009. Further flooding in 2010 resulted in damage to repairs made previously and closures effective until May 2011. In July 2018, flash flooding forced the helicopter evacuation of 200 visitors. All tourism was suspended from March 2020 until February 2023 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Geography and climate==

Located within the Grand Canyon, Supai is accessible only by foot, pack animal or helicopter. It is the only place in the United States where mules still carry the mail, most of which is food.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land. It lies above sea level.
===Climate===

Supai has a cool desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWk&quot;) , with very hot summers coupled with mild nights, and relatively mild winters with nights cooling off to below freezing on many days.
==Demographics==
As with many communities living on reservations, the census is often miscounted. In the 2020 census, the population of Supai was counted as zero. In 2023, the Associated Press reported that &quot;about 500 of the nearly 770&quot; members of the Havasupai tribe live in the village.
As of the census of 2010, there were 208 people and 43 households. The racial makeup of the CDP was 96.6% Native American, 0.5% White, 0.5% Other, and 2.4% of mixed race. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.3% of the population.

There were 43 households, out of which 34.9% were married families living together, 32.6% had a female householder with no husband present, 14.0% had a male householder with no wife present, and 18.6% were non-families. 16.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 2.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 4.84.

In the CDP the population was spread out, with 30.8% under the age of 16, 10.4% from 16 to 21, 54.8% from 21 to 65, and 4.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 25.2 years. 48.6% of the population was male; 51.4% was female.

==Government and infrastructure==

Supai is located inside the Grand Canyon on tribal lands outside of national park jurisdiction and is governed by the tribe.

There is a post office in Supai. Mules are used to ferry mail between Supai and the rest of the United States. Perishable goods are, as of 2016, stored in a walk-in freezer at the Peach Springs, Arizona, post office while they await being loaded onto mules. According to The Smithsonian, the Peach Springs post office is the only one in the country with a walk-in freezer.

A contractor, who as of 2016 had held the contract with the post office for 25 years, picks up the mail and drives it an hour to the trailhead, where it&#x27;s loaded onto mules for the journey down the canyon. Each mule carries up to 200 pounds of mail.

===Access===

Supai can be reached by hiking , descending in elevation from Hualapai Hilltop through the Hualapai Canyon. Helicopters also fly from Hualapai Hilltop into Supai. Hualapai Hilltop, the trailhead for Havasupai Trail, is located about from the community of Peach Springs, along paved BIA Road 18.

==Education==

There is one K–8 school in Supai, Havasupai Elementary School, run by the Bureau of Indian Education. Additionally, by 1970 there was a Head Start program in Supai.

Supai lacks a high school. In 1988, Havasupai ES was K-8, and residents went to boarding schools after the 8th grade. The most common boarding school, that year, was Sherman Indian High School in Riverside, California. In 1967, most older students (past the second grade, the upper grade at Havasupai ES at the time) attended school in Fort Apache or Phoenix. In that time period some students went to boarding schools in California. Some other students stayed with host families and attended school district-operated public schools. Prior to its closure, the Phoenix Indian School was the closest Native American boarding high school to Supai.

According to Coconino County&#x27;s parcel viewer, Supai is in the &quot;Unorganized School District #00&quot;. According to Arizona law, an unorganized school district is one that does not have a high school. The 2010 U.S. Census school district map for Coconino County shows Supai as in &quot;School District Not Defined&quot;. Areas not in school districts are under the jurisdiction of the respective County Superintendent of Schools.

==Culture==
Reggae music is popular in the Supai community; according to &quot;Afropop&quot;, the residents feel &quot;a kinship with the Rastafarian faith&quot;. According &quot;Cannabis Culture&quot;, Bob Marley had wanted to visit but died before he could make the trip. Tyrone Downie and Cedelia Booker learned of the popularity of the music after Chris Blackwell encountered several Supai residents in a Las Vegas record store buying reggae and helicoptered into Supai in 1982 with a grand piano and played a concert.

In 1984 an Arizona reggae band, Shagnatty, gave a concert; a photojournalist accompanying the band reported residents told her the music had been popular in the community for as long as 25 years, when visitors from California had introduced it. She describes community members joining the band on stage and toasting in Supai.

== Tourism ==
Tourism is economically important. When COVID-19 shut down area tourism, the tribe estimated a 60-day closure of tourism to Supai would result in a 15% loss to the tribe&#x27;s annual revenues.

As of 2014 approximately 20,000 people visit each year, most to see and hike around Havasu Falls and other nearby waterfalls. There is a campground and Havasupai Lodge in Supai on tribal grounds, and a National Park Service campground and Phantom Ranch outside of Supai on national park grounds.

==Services==
Supai has one small, air-conditioned lodge (Havasupai Lodge), a convenience store and a cafe.

<text>Tuba City () is an unincorporated town and census-designated place in Coconino County, Arizona, on the Navajo Nation, United States. It is the second-largest community in Coconino County. The population of the census-designated place (CDP) was 8,611 at the 2010 census.

It is the most populous community within the Navajo Nation, and the site of the headquarters of the Western Navajo Agency. The Hopi village of Moenkopi lies directly to its southeast. A Hopi minority also live in Tuba City; the majority are Navajo.

European Americans associated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints named the town in honor of chief Tuuvi, a Hopi man from Oraibi. He converted to the Mormon faith and allowed their migrants to settle in this area.

The Navajo name for this community, &quot;&quot;, translates as &quot;tangled waters&quot;. It likely refers to the many below-ground springs that are the source of several reservoirs.

Tuba City is located within the Painted Desert near the western edge of the Navajo Nation. Tuba City is located approximately from the eastern entrance to Grand Canyon National Park and approximately from Flagstaff.

==History==

The Tuba City area was the territory of indigenous peoples for thousands of years. The community was first documented by Spanish explorers: Father Francisco Garcés visited the area in 1776, and recorded that the Hopi were cultivating crops.

European-American migrants came as part of the Mormon movement to the West in the late 19th century. They named the town after &quot;Tuuvi&quot;, a Hopi man who converted to Mormonism circa 1870. He had invited the Mormons to settle near his village of Moenkopi without requiring them to gain individual permission.

The Tuba City Trading Post was established in 1870. It dealt with the Navajo and Paiute who came to the area for the natural springs, as well as the Hopi already in the area.
European-American Mormon emigrants claimed to found Tuba City in 1872.

In 1956, uranium began to be mined near Tuba City. The regional office for the Rare Metals Corporation was established here, which founded a mill for processing. The Atomic Energy Commission had an office here as well. The mill closed in 1966, before environmental regulations were passed to protect the local people and resources.

Reclamation of the millsite and tailings pile was completed in 1990 because the tailings had high radioactive content and were environmentally hazardous waste products that had to be cleared.

The Tuba City Regional Health Care Corporation hospital is located in Tuba City. It is a non-profit, Native American-run health care corporation that employs 1,200 people. The next nearest hospital is in Flagstaff.

In 2023, the Tuba City Entrepreneurship Hub opened, sponsored by Change Labs, a Native-led nonprofit supporting entrepreneurship on tribal land through free work spaces for entrepreneurs, vendors, and artists within Native communities. It features community gardens raised by local farmers in the Change Labs program.

In June 2007, they made a neutral presentation to the community, offering revenue projections and an overview of pros and cons. In April 2008, about 30 voters signed a petition to put the question of incorporation on the September 2, 2008, ballot. The measure was defeated by a vote of 78 to 62.

Another vote, held on March 9, 2010, proved more successful when the measure was approved by a margin of 116 to 71, making Tusayan the 91st incorporated place in the state of Arizona.

==Economy==
In 1875, prospectors found silver in the San Carlos Apache Reservation, including an unusual globe-shaped silver nugget. In just four years, the silver began to give out, but by then copper deposits were discovered. In the 1900s, the Old Dominion Copper Company in Globe ranked as one of the world&#x27;s richest. The Old Dominion closed in 1931, and mining operations moved to nearby Miami.

Globe&#x27;s economy remains heavily dependent on the service industry, and the mining industry, and the city was home to one of the few operating copper smelters in the United States.

Major employers in Globe include Gila County, Arizona State Prison Complex – Florence, Heritage Health Care Center, Globe Unified School District, and Gila Community College.

==History==
Besh-Ba-Gowah, about one mile south of Globe, was occupied by Salado populations between AD 1225 and AD 1400.

In 1875 silver was discovered in the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation. Accordingly, that same year, the mining camp at Ramboz Peak nearest to the reservation relocated to what became Globe. The plans for an incorporated Globe were established in July 1876, with retail stores, banks, and Globe&#x27;s first newspaper printing its first issue on May 2, 1878. By February 1881, Globe was the Gila County seat. Coming with Globe&#x27;s new importance as the county seat came a stagecoach line linking it to Silver City, New Mexico.

Due to Globe&#x27;s relative isolation from the rest of Arizona and its proximity to the San Carlos Apache reservation, Globe remained a frontier town. Globe&#x27;s history is laced with many historic events such as murders, stagecoach robberies, outlaws, lynchings, and Apache raids. Natiotish, a San Carlos Apache, left the reservation with a group of about 50 men and continued to attack ranchers and miners.

In 1884 the surviving Clanton brothers Ike and Phineas arrived in Apache County after the infamous gunfight at the OK Corral in Tombstone. Ike was eventually killed by a local deputy sheriff, and Phineas, after serving prison time for a stage robbery, moved to Globe, where he died of pneumonia and was buried in 1906.

Globe is also known for having links to Geronimo and the Apache Kid. On October 23, 1889, the Apache Kid&#x27;s trial was held in the Globe Courthouse. After he was convicted, it was the responsibility of Sheriff Glenn Reynolds to transport him to the Arizona Territorial Prison in Yuma. Sheriff Reynolds, his deputy, and their prisoners set out in an armored stagecoach holding the Apache Kid inside. At an incline in the road, known as the Kelvin Grade Massacre, near present-day Kearny, Sheriff Reynolds let some of the prisoners out of the stagecoach seeing as they were on an uphill climb and he wanted to ease the burden on the horses. The prisoners were able to overcome and murder Sheriff Reynolds as well as one other man. A third was left for dead. In response, the United States Army launched a campaign to track down the renegades.

===Old Dominion copper mine===

The Old Dominion Mining Company was incorporated in 1880, and ran &quot;on a financial roller-coaster&quot; for the next twenty years. In 1894, the mine was sold to the Lewisohn Brothers of New York. The arrival of the railroad in 1898 dramatically lowered shipping costs. In 1904, the mine was acquired by Phelps-Dodge, who appointed Louis D. Ricketts as general manager. From 1904 to 1908, Phelps-Dodge spent $2.5 million on expanding and modernizing the mine and plant. As the mine grew, so did Globe. World War 1 brought increased copper demand; the mine and town both prospered. 1917 was a year of labor unrest in the copper mines nationwide. A strike on the Globe mines was called on July 1, 1917. Federal troops were called in to restore order, miners began returning to work, and the mine was back to normal production by October.
In the postwar years, the Old Dominion never returned to its former glory. Neglected maintenance, declining ore grades, and flooding underground all took their toll. The mine closed during the recession of 1921–22, and the mine closed permanently in 1931. In its half-century of operation, the mine produce some 800 million pounds of copper, and returned gross earnings of $134 million to shareholders. It was the economic mainstay for the Globe community for most of this half-century.

The property was sold to the Miami Copper Company as a water supply in 1941, and continues to supply both industrial and domestic water to the area.

<text>Hayden is a town in Gila and Pinal counties in Arizona, United States. According to the 2010 census, the population of the town was 662.

==History==
Hayden was founded in 1909 and owned by the Kennecott Copper Corp. In 1912, the company built a smelter named the &quot;Hayden Smelter&quot;. It was the tallest smelter chimney in Arizona. The mine is now owned by the American Smelting and Refining Company. The town is now in the process of becoming a ghost town.

One of the main reasons the people are abandoning the town is that the crime rate is much higher in Hayden than the Arizona average crime rate. It is also much higher than the national average crime rate in the rest of the United States.

Pollution is another factor which has contributed to the abandonment of the town by its residents. The illegal amounts of lead, arsenic and eight other dangerous compounds released by the smelter were so huge that in 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) took action against the smelter.

Hayden&#x27;s economy began to decline as the mine veins became depleted. The crime rate rose and residents began to move out. There were also political scandals. Businesses closed, and churches, schools and houses were abandoned or burned. The Valley National Bank abandoned its building, and it now occupied by the Hayden Police Department. According to the mayor, Bob Smith, Hayden has more police cars than police officers.

==Mining==
The Miami mine is owned and operated by Freeport-McMoRan. Mining began in 1911 as the Inspiration mine, and the nation&#x27;s first froth flotation copper concentrator to process sulfide minerals was built and began production in 1915. Inspiration was among the first to employ vat leaching in 1926 and precipitation plants to recover oxide minerals. Copper was mined underground until after World War II, when the first open-pit mining began. The plant&#x27;s smelter was modernized in 1974 to meet Clean Air Act standards and further modernized and expanded in 1992. The success of a solvent extraction and electrowinning plant commissioned in 1979 ended vat leaching by the mid-1980s, and the concentrator closed in 1986 as well. The copper rod mill was commissioned in 1966.

Copper mining was suspended in September 2015. Leaching/SX-EW operations will continue but are expected to decline over time. The Miami smelter and rod plant continue to operate. In 2016, copper production at Miami amounted to 25 million pounds of copper. In 2017, copper production was 19 million pounds, and more than 740 people were employed there.

The Pinto Valley mine is also located near Miami.

==Transportation==
The Town of Miami operates the Cobre Valley Community Transit, which provides local bus service in Miami and Globe.

Greyhound Lines serves Miami on its Phoenix-El Paso via Globe route. The Miami stop serves Globe.

<text>Payson () is a town in northern Gila County, Arizona, United States. Due to Payson&#x27;s location being very near to the geographic center of Arizona, it has been called &quot;The Heart of Arizona&quot;. The town is surrounded by the Tonto National Forest, the largest of the six national forests in Arizona—and the ninth largest national forest in the United States.

Payson boasts a lively festival calendar, including The World&#x27;s Oldest Continuous Rodeo, established in 1884, as well as the Arizona State Old Time Fiddlin&#x27; Championship which celebrates the area&#x27;s musical heritage.

As of the 2020 census, the population of Payson was 16,361.

==History==

Prior to the arrival of European-American settlers, the area was known as Te-go-suk—or Place of the Yellow Water—by the Dilzhe&#x27;e Apache. The area was also historically inhabited by the Yavapai and other Oasisamerican peoples, including the Hohokam, Mogollon, Salado, and Sinagua cultures.

In 1882, considered to be the founding year of Payson, area settlers established a logging, mining, and ranching hamlet called “Green Valley.&quot;

That same year, the Battle of Big Dry Wash—fought between troops of the United States Army&#x27;s 3rd Cavalry Regiment, 6th Cavalry Regiment, and members of the White Mountain Apache Tribe—took place just north of town on the Mogollon Rim. The battle occurred within the greater context of the Apache Wars.

On March 3, 1884, a post office was built in Green Valley with the help of Illinois Representative Levi Joseph Payson. In honor of the representative&#x27;s help, the town&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Payson&quot;.

Payson held its first rodeo in 1884. The town declares the competition to be the world&#x27;s oldest and continuous rodeo as it has been held every year since.

In 1918, author Zane Grey made his first trip to the area surrounding Payson. He would visit with regularity through 1929, and he purchased two plots of land near Tonto Creek, including from Sampson Elam Boles under Myrtle Point. Grey wrote numerous books about the area, and he also filmed movies in the area, such as &quot;To the Last Man&quot;. His cabin is located in Green Valley park.

During Prohibition, the manufacture, sale, and distribution of liquor was plentiful in Payson. These transactions took place on historic Bootleg Alley. “Payson Dew,” brewed across 30 to 40 stills in the Payson area, was coveted from as far away as Los Angeles. The drink helped to reinvigorate Payson’s economy.

During the 1930s, an effort was initiated to better connect Payson to the outside world through the construction of roads and highways. At that time, the town was very isolated—with a trip from Phoenix to Payson taking eight to twelve hours. Throughout the 1950s, work progressed on a paved road from Phoenix to Payson, and the road was completed in 1958. The highway, State Route 87 (also known as the &quot;Beeline Highway&quot;), was later expanded to four lanes.

Payson was officially incorporated in 1973.

=== Ellison Creek &amp; East Verde River flooding ===

On July 15, 2017, heavy rains from upstream of the creek and river caused the waterways to swell, subsequently leading to downstream flooding. This flash flood crucially affected the popular Water Wheel swimming hole where 10 people were killed and 4 others were injured.

==Geography==
Payson is located in northern Gila County—within the hilly and mountainous terrain of the Arizona transition zone. The town sits at an elevation of , and it has a total area of .

State Route 260 leads east to Show Low.

===Zane Grey Country===
&quot;Zane Grey Country&quot; is a term for the area around Payson. This term was most often used in the 1970s and 1980s, and appeared in the header of the local newspaper, the &quot;Payson Roundup&quot;. In recent times, it has fallen somewhat out of favor, as the term &quot;Rim Country&quot; has become more popular among locals.

<text>Top-of-the-World is a census-designated place (CDP) in Gila and Pinal counties in the U.S. state of Arizona. The population was 274 at the 2020 census, up from 231 at the 2010 census, and down from 330 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==
Top-of-the-World is located in eastern Pinal County at (33.346856, -110.995172). The CDP extends east into Gila County. U.S. Route 60 passes through the center of the community, leading east to Globe and southwest to Superior. The center of Phoenix is to the west.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

==History==
Located on US-60, 9.1 miles (14 km) west of Miami at the divide between Miami and Superior at the 4,600-foot (1,400 m) level. This area is mostly in Pinal County. Mason’s Valley, named after Charles G. Mason an early settler in Florence, Arizona and a prospector who with others discovered the Globe mining district and also developed the fabulous Silver King Mine north of Superior. “We crossed the lofty Pinal Range over into the beautiful little nook known as Mason’s Valley.” Today Mason’s Valley is often called both Pinal Ranch and Top-of-the-World, the latter being an unfortunate misnomer from a much later camping and recreation facility that was created in 1922 located on the old alignment of US-60 in Gila County about two miles west, not in Mason’s Valley.

The name &quot;Pinal&quot; is taken from Pinar Spanish for &quot;pine groves in the mountains,&quot; and is the name of the Mountain Range South of Globe, west to Superior, and north to the Salt River. These Mountains were home to the Western Apache Pinal Band of Native Americans, whom the US Military found particularly vexing for their frequent raids to surrounding settlements, ranches, and mines. “(the troops) at Camp Pinal, and it’s dependencies will clear the country (of Indians) lying between the Gila and Salt Rivers and the western boundary of the White Mountain Reservation.” As a consequence in 1870 a camp was ordered built in the Pinal Mountains to house an infantry camp to serve as a supply post and bivouac camp for Cavalry fighting the Apaches in the mountains. The two dependent camps of Camp Pinal were Camp Picket Post ten miles east on Queen Creek, and a small detachment at a construction camp on the Upper Stoneman Grade called Camp Supply where stone ovens were built and bread for both camps was baked.

The original camp, called Infantry Camp, was located four miles southeast of Mason’s Valley on the divide between Mineral Creek and Pinto Creek at the location of the future Gibson Mine and Bellevue settlement. “A military post is ordered established in the Pinal Mountains, some 50 miles north of Grant, to be called ‘Infantry Camp.’.” “INFANTRY CAMP, Mason’s Valley, A.T.. - ...on one of the many dry forks at the head of Mineral Creek, a tributary of the Gila. …estimated distance from Camp Grant, fifty-two miles.” “…Stores continue to arrive regular per ‘Hog Express’ as package was marked”. The camp was there a very short time before being relocated to Mason’s Valley, but was still called Infantry Camp. Five months after relocation the Military ordered the name changed to Camp Pinal, and a picket post of Camp Pinal to be located at the foot of Tortilla Mountain on Queen Creek, General Stoneman established both camps and constructed the mule trail between the famously known of Stoneman’s Grade.

The site was abandoned in late in 1871, the last printed mention of troops there was October 20. The troops started the Stoneman Grade at Camp Picket Post at the foot of Picket post Mountain on Queen Creek. It did not enter Queen Creek Canyon. The trail traveled north from Camp Picket Post, up the face of Kings Crown Mountain, around the peak across the headwaters of Queen Creek, across Oak Flats, Devil&#x27;s Canyon, and up Irion Canyon to Camp Pinal. The military efforts of Stoneman cleared the Southern Pinal Mountains of Apaches, and the Stoneman Grade was the way most early miners and settlers traveled to the Globe-Miami District.

The Pinal Ranch was built at the site of Camp Pinal. The ranch was begun before 1874. First owned by Andy Hawkins and partner Thomas Buchanan. “They built a fine juniper house, corrals and outbuildings. In 1877 they produced 30,000 pounds of potatoes.” Hospitality business was good providing shelter and food for travelers on the Stoneman Trail to Globe. In 1877 Mr. and Mrs. Robert A. Irion and Mrs. Irion’s young son Dudley Craig bought out Andy Hawkins.16 The Irion’s improved upon the ranch, and around 1880 bought Buchanan’s share and it remained in the Craig family until the 1970s. The large adobe ranch house is still in good condition, in spite of its 100+ years. They had productive fields for corn and vegetables, and planted a large and productive apple orchard in addition to running cattle on their range. His stepson Dudley Craig continued the ranching tradition in the area after Irion&#x27;s death.

:“We crossed the lofty Pinal Range over into the beautiful little nook known as Mason’s Valley.” Today Mason’s Valley is often called both Pinal Ranch and Top-of-the-World, the latter being an unfortunate misnomer from a much later camping and recreation facility that was created in 1922 located on the old alignment of US-60 in Gila County about two miles west, not in Mason’s Valley.

<doc id="106627" wikidata="Q985303" url="?curid=106627" title="Duncan, Arizona">
<text>Duncan is a town in Greenlee County, Arizona, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population of the town was 696. In 2018 the estimated population was 789.

Duncan is in the Gila River valley, west of the Arizona–New Mexico border. The town limits are on both sides of the Gila River, but the primary portion of the town and the entire downtown area lies on the south side of the river.

Duncan was founded in the mid-19th century, and the land was added to the United States as a part of the Mexican Cession, and the Gadsden Purchase. The town of Duncan has been destroyed twice by flood and once by fire.

The town and unincorporated county surrounding the town are primarily populated by farming, ranching, and mining families. (Freeport-McMoRan Inc., Morenci &amp; Safford copper mines in southeastern Arizona and Chino &amp; Tyrone in southwestern New Mexico). Surrounding smaller unincorporated settlements such as Franklin and York in Arizona, and the Village of Virden, New Mexico, all use Duncan public schools. The areas along the Gila River are renowned for Native American artifacts such as arrowheads, pottery, burial sites, cave paintings, and other remnants of the Anasazi and other pre-historic cultures that inhabited the area until overpopulation and severe droughts between 1000 and 1290 C.E. caused them to vanish, (a remnant of the Chiricahua Band of Apache Indians remained in the upper Gila River Valley as late as the 1930s) as well as artifacts from garrison camps of the expedition of Francisco Vázquez de Coronado.

Duncan High School (mascot: Wildkat; school colors: red, grey, and white) competes in many sports, Fall- Mens &quot;8 Man&quot; Football AIA Div 1, Ladies VolleyBall, M/W Cross-country; Winter - M/W Basketball; Spring - Mens Baseball, Womens Softball, M/W Tennis, M/W Golf, M/W Track &amp; Field.

U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor was born in El Paso, Texas, but grew up near Duncan on the Lazy B ranch, which straddles the border between Arizona and New Mexico. The Day family ran the ranch for many years until selling it; it continues to be run as a ranch. O&#x27;Connor later wrote a book titled &quot;Lazy B: Growing up on a Cattle Ranch in the American Southwest&quot; about her childhood experiences on the ranch with her brother H. Alan Day.
