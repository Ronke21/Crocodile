<text>Fort Pierce is a city in and the county seat of St. Lucie County, Florida, United States. The city is part of the Treasure Coast region of Atlantic Coast Florida. It is also known as the Sunrise City. Per the 2020 census, the population was 47,297.

==History==
The city was named after the Fort Pierce army post which was built nearby in 1838 during the Second Seminole War, and lasted until 1842. The military post had been named for Benjamin Kendrick Pierce, a career United States Army officer and the brother of President Franklin Pierce. 

The first permanent settlement of the current city was during the 1860s. In 1901, the city was officially incorporated as a municipality. It was the largest city on Florida&#x27;s Atlantic Coast between Daytona Beach and West Palm Beach until 1970, when it was surpassed by Melbourne.

===Lincoln Park===
The neighborhood of Lincoln Park, the area north of Moore&#x27;s Creek, originated as Edgartown. The renowned writer, Zora Neale Hurston lived in the neighborhood. In its heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, a thriving African-American community, centered along Avenue D. It was the county&#x27;s center for African-American businesses and the Lincoln Theater on Avenue D. Lincoln Park Academy is situated in the neighborhood on Avenue I, west of North 17th Street. 

===The Florida Highwaymen===

Lincoln Park each February hosts a celebration of the artwork of the African-American collective of landscape artists formed in the 1950s. Local artist A.E. Backus mentored many of the artists at his gallery. Several of the artists got their start at Lincoln Park Academy under the leadership of teacher Zanobia Jefferson. Art historian Jim Fitch in 1994 gave the group the name of &#x27;the Highwaymen&#x27;. Over the course of 2001 to 2020, Gary Monroe wrote several books on the artwork of the 26 artists known as Highwaymen (including one woman).

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 29.84 mi2 (77.29 km2), of which 23.79 square miles (61.62 km2) is land and 6.05 square miles (15.67 km2) of it (20%) is water. 

===Environment===
====Shore Protection project====
According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, The Fort Pierce Beach Shore Protection project includes of shore-line running from immediately south of the Fort Pierce Inlet southward to Surfside Park. The project is on a two-year renourishment cycle due to impacts to the beach from the federal navigation project at Fort Pierce Inlet. This two-year renourishment cycle is a much shorter renourishment interval than what is typical for other projects along the east coast of Florida.

The initial construction of the project occurred in 1971, and the ninth nourishment was completed in May 2013. Completion of plans and specifications, advertisement and award for the 10th renourishment contract were completed in FY 2014. The project was scheduled to start mid-February 2015. Sand for the project is dredged from an approved offshore borrow area known as the Capron Shoal and then pumped via a pipeline onto the of beach south of the Fort Pierce Inlet. The sponsor, St. Lucie County, is preparing a General Reevaluation Report (GRR) for the project at their own expense that will evaluate extending Federal participation for an additional 50 years. Current Federal participation expires in 2020.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates the total cost of the project to be $75.9 million, with an estimated U.S. Federal Government share of $46.4 million. No funding for the project was requested by the U.S. President from the U.S. Congress in Fiscal Year 2016.

====Ecology====
The Experimental Oculina Research Reserve preserves the Oculina Banks, a reef of ivory bush coral (&quot;Oculina varicosa&quot;) off the coast of Fort Pierce, Florida. In 1984, a 92 square-nautical-mile (316 km2) portion of these reefs was designated the &quot;Oculina Habitat Area of Particular Concern&quot;. In 1994, the area was closed to all manner of bottom fishing and was redesignated as a research reserve. In 2000, the marine protected area was expanded to 300 square nautical miles (1,030 km2) and prohibited all gears that caused mechanical disruption to the habitat. The city is also known for its large manatee population.

====Marina====

Due to the devastation caused at the Fort Pierce City Marina by hurricanes Frances and Jeanne in 2004, FEMA mandated a plan to ensure that the rebuilt facility would be protected from future such events before FEMA would release funding for the repairs. Starting in 2012, construction began to create 12 artificial barrier islands including oyster beds, lime rock artificial reefs, mangrove fringes and coastal dune. The &quot;core&quot; of the islands was constructed of TITANTubes, sometimes referred to as geotextile tubes or geotubes, manufactured by Flint Industries and covered by a coastal marine mattress and then armor stone. The project was completed in 2013 after six years of planning, permitting and construction and a cost of $18 million.

===Climate===
Fort Pierce is located in the broad transition zone between a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), which dominates Central Florida, and within the northern extent of the tropical climate typical of South Florida.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Fort Pierce is located on U.S. Route 1, near its intersection with Florida State Road 70. Interstate 95 and Florida&#x27;s Turnpike are nearby, at the west edge of town. The Intracoastal Waterway passes through the city. The nearest airport with scheduled passenger service is in Melbourne; the closest major airport is in West Palm Beach. The city itself has a general aviation airport, Treasure Coast International Airport.

Fort Pierce is served by the St. Lucie Transportation Planning Organization (TPO). The TPO is a Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), a federally mandated and federally funded transportation policy-making organization responsible for transportation planning, programming, and financing of State and Federal transportation funds for the City of Fort Pierce. The TPO is governed by a TPO Board, which is composed of elected officials, representatives from the St. Lucie County School Board, and representatives from Community Transit, a division of The Council on Aging of St. Lucie, Inc. The original bus system started as a demand response service bus in the 1990s; it only served St. Lucie County. Soon it expanded to a fixed route system, going to predetermined locations along a route. On June 3, 2002, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) approved funding, expanding the bus service to Martin County, and it became the Treasure Coast Connector.

From 1894 to 1968, the Florida East Coast Railway served the city as a passenger railroad. Until a strike beginning in 1963, several long-distance passenger trains from Chicago, Cincinnati and New York City made stops there, en route to Miami. These long distances trains included the Illinois Central Railroad&#x27;s &quot;City of Miami&quot; and the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad&#x27;s &quot;South Wind&quot;, both heading from Chicago; and the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad&#x27;s &quot;East Coast Champion&quot;, the &quot;Havana Special&quot;, and the winter-only &quot;Florida Special&quot; originating from New York. Into the latter 1950s, passengers could take the &quot;Dixie Flagler&quot; to Chicago via Atlanta from the station. The FEC continued a six day a week Jacksonville-Miami train from 1965 to 1968, per court order.

Amtrak and the Florida East Coast Railway had been planning to make stations along Florida&#x27;s East Coast. The cities cited by Amtrak and the Florida Department of Transportation included: Stuart, Fort Pierce, Vero Beach, Melbourne, Titusville, Cocoa, Daytona Beach and St. Augustine.

In 2023, Brightline, an inter-city rail route that currently runs between Miami and Orlando, announced that it was looking for sites for a new station on the Treasure Coast. As of 2024, there are currently no plans to add a station in Fort Pierce.

<text>Port St. Lucie is a city in St. Lucie County, Florida, United States. It is the most-populous municipality in the county and the seventh-most populous city in Florida, with a population of 204,851 at the 2020 census. It is located southeast of Orlando and north of Miami. It is a principal city in the Port St. Lucie metropolitan statistical area, which includes St. Lucie and Martin Counties, and had an estimated population of 502,521. Port St. Lucie is also a principal city in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Port St. Lucie combined statistical area, which had an estimated population of 6,841,100 .

==History==
The name &quot;St. Lucie&quot; is originally derived from the name of a settlement near Jupiter Inlet, which was founded on St. Lucia&#x27;s Day in 1566. Due to numerous errors, the name later came to be associated with the present-day town of St. Lucie Village, Florida, north of present-day Port St. Lucie. After La Florida and St. Augustine, it is the oldest still-in-use European place name in the United States. In the early 1890s, an early pioneer settlement named Spruce Bluff was located along the St. Lucie River, which consisted of a community of several families with a school, post office, pineapple plantation, and sawmill. Currently, the land the settlement was located on is part of the Spruce Bluff Preserve. Along with an old cemetery near the old settlement, the preserve also contains a hiking area, canoe access, observation areas, and a prehistoric Ais Indian mound located on the southern end of the preserve.

In the 1950s, the land that eventually became Port St. Lucie was a largely uninhabited tract of land south of White City, composed of a fishing camp (Burt Pruitt&#x27;s Fishin&#x27; Farm) along the St. Lucie River, a few farms and businesses near U.S. 1. In 1958, with a budget of $50 million, the General Development Corporation (GDC) purchased the River Park development and along the North Fork of the St. Lucie River. In 1959, the GDC opened its first bridge over the St. Lucie River, allowing for direct automobile access to Port St. Lucie.

By February 25, 1961, 250 homes were in the new city. GDC requested the state legislature to incorporate , along with the River Park settlement, into the City of Port St. Lucie. River Park did not incorporate into the city at the request of its residents. Port St. Lucie became a city on April 27, 1961, with the passage of House Bill No. 953, proposed by State Representative Rupert Smith and approved by Florida Governor C. Farris Bryant.

In the early 1990s, Core Communities (CC), acquired and began planning what would become St. Lucie West. Originally, St. Lucie West was to have contained about 14,000 homes over a 20-year period on , but after realizing the community&#x27;s strategic position, they began developing it into more than just a residential area. CC began building business sectors and places of entertainment and leisure. That resulted in 7,000 jobs being brought to the small town, helping it into its boom during most of the early 2000s.

In 2006, CC started development of its newest community, Tradition, which sits west of the Interstate 95 interchange with Gatlin Blvd., and was a large cattle ranch before CC began to develop it. Around of commercial area were built, with room for over 18,000 residences. According to CC&#x27;s website, Tradition is the largest fully entitled residential development area from the tip of Interstate 95 to the Canada–U.S. border. It is modeled after a 1950s-era town. According to its website, Tradition Square, the town center of the community, holds festivities year-round. It was also chosen as the site of HGTV&#x27;s &quot;Green Home&quot; in 2009.

In 2007, the housing market began to collapse and unemployment started to rise. As of February 2009, unemployment was about 10.5%, and in 2008, nearly 11,000 homes went into foreclosure. This prompted the county government to consider declaring itself a disaster area. Doing so would have given county administrators access to $17 million in county emergency reserve funds. That money, combined with a transportation fund and other accounts, would give St. Lucie $20 – $30 million to spend on building projects - research parks, highways, and other infrastructure improvements.

In 2008, Tradition and Core Communities welcomed the Florida Center of Innovation (later renamed Tradition Center for Innovation), a 150-acre privately owned research park dedicated to drug discovery, immunology and medical devices, and healthcare. TCI initially composed of Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies, Oregon Health and Science University&#x27;s Vaccine and Gene Therapy Institute (VGTI), Martin Health System Hospital (Tradition Medical Center), and Mann Research Center. In 2015, VGTI shut down their TCI facility, and Mann Research Center soon followed. As of 2019, only Torrey Pines and the Tradition Medical Center remain in TCI.

In 2017, TAMCO, a subsidiary of City Electric Supply, a family-owned electrical wholesale business, created plans with the Port St. Lucie city council to construct a $38 million, 400,000-square-foot manufacturing and distribution center located in the Tradition Commerce Park. Construction of the TAMCO facility began in 2018 and was completed in late 2019.

<text>Center Hill is a city in Sumter County, Florida, United States. The population was 846 at the 2020 census. 

==History==

===Early inhabitants===
By 1800, Black Seminoles and &quot;maroons&quot;, or fugitive slaves, had settled in the present-day City of Center Hill, which was initially called &quot;Abraham&#x27;s Old Town&quot;, near the Wahoo Swamp. Maroons who fought for England joined the Black Seminoles after the runaway slaves fled to Florida, a free territory under Spanish rule, to avoid remaining in slavery following the American Revolution. Both Black Seminoles and maroons lived with the Seminoles in a feudal-like relationship; the Black Seminoles paid the Seminoles with a percentage of their crops in exchange for their freedom. The Black Seminoles settled in the Center Hill area in 1813 and named it &quot;Peliklakaha&quot;. Accompanying them was Seminole chief Micanopy, who made Peliklakaha his residence after the death of Payne.

The town had about 100 residents. They came as runaway slaves from Georgia. Others were of African descent, specifically from the Kongo region, and some Seminoles, including one of Micanopy&#x27;s wives, lived in Peliklakaha. The town&#x27;s layout was influenced by slave quarters, Seminole villages, and African villages. The residents lived in buildings constructed from daub, thatch, and lumber. Peliklakaha participated in regional trade with the Seminoles, black hunters travelling to South Florida, and white travelers as the village was located at the center of several well-travelled Native American trails.

The United States and Florida governments noticed the area&#x27;s fertility. In 1823, while informing the Seminoles about the meeting at Moultrie Creek, Horatio S. Dexter, an envoy sent by Florida territorial governor William P. Duval, discovered that the Black Seminoles grew rice, peanuts, and corn. In 1826, United States Army General George McCall visited Peliklakaha and noticed that their farms were located on what General McCall called &quot;the finest land&quot;.

===Second Seminole War===

Whites called the town &quot;Abraham&#x27;s Old Town&quot;, after Abraham, a former slave who had been given his freedom by the British and who served as a recruiter and an interpreter for the Seminoles. After hearing that Francis L. Dade and his men were to cross through the territory, Abraham anticipated an attack on Peliklakaha and convinced Micanopy to move Seminole soldiers to the Fort King Road. Abraham left the village after Dade&#x27;s Massacre on December 28, 1835. A short time later in 1836, General Winfield Scott moved General Abraham Eustis&#x27; troops to the Peliklakaha area to destroy the Seminoles. General Eustis and his troops burned Peliklakaha; no Seminoles were killed as Peliklakaha&#x27;s population fled to the Wahoo Swamp before Eustis’ forces arrived. General Eustis would later commission a painting depicting the burning of Peliklakaha, which later was hung in the Library of Congress.

On April 19, 1842, Colonel William J. Worth attacked Halleck Tustenuggee at Peliklakaha. During the battle, Halleck Tustenuggee and his warriors constructed a log barricade. United States Army soldiers attacked the front of the barricade while dragoons attacked from the back. Halleck Tustenuggee and his warriors retreated, and the United States Army burned the camp. The battle left one soldier dead and four wounded on the United States side and one soldier killed and one captured on the Seminole side. A few days later, Halleck Tustenuggee, two of his wives, and two of his children voluntarily surrendered to Worth at Warm Springs. On August 14, 1842, Worth declared the Second Seminole War over.

===Settlement by whites===
In the late 1830s and early 1840s, the Mobley and Beville families settled in the area. Either the town&#x27;s postmaster Thomas W. Spicer
 or Carrie Lovell named the town &quot;Center Hill&quot;. Spicer thought that the town was the hub of activity. Lovell named the town after its location of being on a hill in the center of the county. In 1925, the City of Center Hill was officially incorporated as a municipality. 

===Agricultural heyday===
According to Broward Mill, the past president of the Sumter County Historical Society, Center Hill was known for its string bean production in the early part of the 20th century. In 1931, Center Hill shipped green beans, green peas, and lima beans to Baltimore, Boston, New York City, Chicago, and Detroit. Beginning in the mid-1930s, Center Hill&#x27;s soil fertility declined. Local bean farmers blamed a decrease in the water table. They believed that the creation of the Jumper Creek Drainage District, which the local circuit court formed in 1922 to reclaim about 24,600 acres by draining water from Jumper Creek into Jumper Lake and the Withlacoochee River, deprived them of water and forced them to irrigate large fields. By 1975, bean production was virtually nonexistent, and the population decreased from a peak of 1,500 people to 37 in 1970. In 1988, area farmers still sent their bell peppers, cucumbers, squash, tomatoes, and watermelons to Center Hill for packing and shipping.

===1990s===
In the 1990s, Center Hill gained a reputation of being a speed trap. The town received a Clinton administration community policing grant of $167,000 (USD) in order to hire ten full and part-time police officers. From the receipt of the grant to 1997, residents complained about the officers issuing traffic tickets, especially for speeding. In November 1997, four police officers, including Police Chief Kendall Alsobrook, left the police force, and the department&#x27;s staff was reduced to one full-time officer.

===Peliklakaha&#x27;s rediscovery===
In 1998, archaeologists from the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida began the first excavation of a Black Seminole village in a pasture about two miles from Center Hill. The researchers hoped to determine the town&#x27;s social structure and the former residents&#x27; lifestyle. The investigators found dozens of artifacts, including iron pieces, stoneware, glass beads, nails, and pottery. Historians believe that over 100 Black Seminoles lived in Peliklakaha, the largest known Black Seminole village. Historians also believe that Peliklakaha was rebuilt after Abraham was among the first Seminoles and Black Seminoles to be transferred to a reservation in the west.

===2000s===
On July 31, 2001, a 500-pound (227-kilogram) Siberian tiger named &quot;Tie&quot; fatally attacked Vincent Lowe, a worker at the Savage Kingdom exotic animal park who was attempting to earn state certification to work with the cats, while Lowe was repairing the cage. The tiger burst through his cage and pounced on Lowe before Lowe could fire his pistol at the tiger. Park owner Robert Baudy shot the cat. The incident was the second one in park history. The first was in March 1997, when another Siberian tiger escaped from its cage and mauled a worker before being killed by members of the Sumter County Sheriff&#x27;s Department. In February 1999, state game officials discovered substandard cage wiring; the ranch corrected the issue by May 1999, the last inspection before the incident. On July 6, 2006, the United States Department of Agriculture ordered that Savage Kingdom&#x27;s license be revoked permanently.

===Central Beef Industries===
In 2013, the Seminole Tribe partnered with Central Beef to slaughter and cut beef for the tribe&#x27;s &quot;Seminole Pride&quot; brand.

Beginning in 1999, Central Beef disposed of 130,000 US gallons (492,103 liters) of wastewater containing high levels of sodium and fecal material per day into neighboring fields. Central Beef owner Marc Chernin offered to buy a neighboring rancher&#x27;s land, but the rancher refused as he and his brother believed that the offer was too low. The ranchers attempted to informally resolve the issue by discussing it with Central Beef management, but they sued the beef processing plant in May 2006. Meanwhile, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) issued warning letters in 2001. A 2003 consent order attempted to address the issue of contamination, but the company, citing insufficient funds to line the ponds around Central Beef, failed to stop the pollution. In 2005, plant manager Dick Greene documented his concerns about the pollution. The DEP began an investigation in April 2006. On August 24, 2006, the DEP arrested Chernin on charges of hazardous waste disposal and felony commercial littering. Chernin pleaded no contest to the charges in July 2007, and he was sentenced to one year&#x27;s probation. The charge of hazardous waste disposal was eventually dropped. After the ranchers&#x27; and the DEP&#x27;s lawsuits, Central Beef began transporting the wastewater off the premises.

<text>Coleman is a city in Sumter County, Florida, United States. The population was 642 at the 2020 census.

==History==

===Second Seminole War===
On June 8, 1840, Colonel W. J. Worth, Colonel Bennet Riley, and the Second and Eighth Infantry divisions transferred to Fort McClure to search the Lake Panasoffkee area for Seminole warriors. Three days later, the troops discovered an empty village.

===Modern town===
By 1853, the &quot;Fort McClure&quot; community was renamed &quot;Warm Springs&quot;.

In 1882, it was officially incorporated as a municipality and renamed the &quot;Town of Coleman&quot; after Dr. B.F. Coleman.

The main industries were citrus, cotton, and cattle. According to Broward Mill, the past president of the Sumter County Historical Society, Coleman became known for its cabbage production in the early part of the 20th century.

On June 20, 1908, the &quot;City of Coleman&quot; was officially reincorporated as a municipality.

In 1926, the West Palm Beach branch of the Seaboard Air Line began operations in Coleman.

In 1966, the American Automobile Association named Coleman the nation&#x27;s biggest speed trap after the city&#x27;s only police officer, Chief Ernest H. Barry, began lurking behind a billboard to catch speeding motorists. Barry arrested 369 motorists in just 5 months, all of them from out of town. In response, Governor W. Haydon Burns wrote a letter to Mayor J. F. Crawford, urging them to treat tourists as guests, after which Barry was fired.

In 1992, Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) officials approved the purchase of on the northeastern shores of Lake Panasoffkee near Coleman for the purchase of environmental preservation. SWFWMD officials sought to preserve over 300 species and neighboring Lake Panasoffkee.

<text>Lake Panasoffkee is a census-designated place (CDP) in Sumter County, Florida, United States. The population was 3,551 at the 2010 census.

==History==

===Early inhabitants===
Boggy Island was an autonomous black Seminole village that was settled by Central African slaves from Kongo. Black Seminoles settled near the Boggy Island area of Lake Panasoffkee around 1813 and named it Sitarkey&#x27;s Village after Sitarkey, an Alachua Seminole who had settled in the area. Nearby laid the areas of Gum Slough and Indian Mound Springs. The Seminoles used the Lake Panasoffkee area to hold councils and Green Corn Dances.

The black Seminoles raised corn, rice, and sugar cane which Dexter gave them in 1822. In addition, residents in Sitarkey&#x27;s Village raised livestock, including cattle, horses, and hogs. They also possibly planted one of the oldest orange groves in Florida.

===Second Seminole War===
Generally, the Sitakey&#x27;s Village area was untouched during the Second Seminole War, allowing black Seminole families to use the area as a refuge from the war. The United States Army, however, did search the village twice. Looking for Seminole warriors, the Second and Eighth Infantry divisions, led by Colonel Bennet Riley and Colonel W. J. Worth, traveled from Fort McClure to the Lake Panasoffkee area on June 10, 1840. On the morning of June 11, the troops found an empty village.

After the battle of Wahoo Swamp, Osceola, possibly suffering from the effects of malaria that he contracted during the Seminole occupation of Fort Drane moved to the Panasoffkee Swamp to live with the black Seminoles who regarded him with devotion.

On January 10, 1837, General Thomas Sidney Jesup, looking for Osceola, raided the village. Osceola and three warriors fled. Jesup captured 16 black Seminoles while the rest of the village escaped. In all, Osceola, 50 warriors, and their families left for the headwaters of the Ocklawaha River. Twelve days later, Jesup led his troops from Fort Armstrong to the Ocklawaha River.

===Modern town===
According to Broward Mill, the past president of the Sumter County Historical Society, Lake Panasoffkee from the time that Sumter County was settled by whites until damaging freezes which wiped out the area&#x27;s citrus industry in the 1880s and 1890s.

Charles G. King, a Cleveland entrepreneur, bought 2,500 acres (square kilometers) in Lake Panasoffkee and developed 737 acres (square kilometers) into Monarch Grove in 1908. An oak hammock on the property was left undisturbed. King and his employees used the sour oranges planted by the Seminoles for orange stock. In 1926, the grove produced about 40,000 boxes of oranges.

Among the evidence was a group of house foundations and chimneys located in places where there were no known white settlers. County officials later believed that the cemetery was a family cemetery as the newer marked graves listed the names of the few people known to be buried there.

===Lake Panasoffkee dredging===
According to Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation commissioners Bob Wattendorf and Marty Hale, Lake Panasoffkee had 15 fish camps and was considered to be one of the state&#x27;s best places to fish.

In 1981, water levels in Lake Panasoffkee dropped to levels that had not been seen since 1962, the year the Wysong Dam was built. Southwest Florida Water Management District officials discussed the construction of a temporary dam to elevate water levels. Lake Panasoffkee residents believed that the Wysong Dam contributed to the destruction of the Withlacoochee River.

==Famous event==

===Little Miss Lake Panasoffkee case===

On February 19, 1971, two hitchhikers from Illinois discovered the partially decomposed body of an unidentified young woman between the ages of 17 and 24 years old under the northbound lane of Lake Panasoffkee&#x27;s Interstate 75 overpass. She was found with a man&#x27;s belt around her neck.

The sheriff&#x27;s department made several attempts to identify the woman. In 1986, the Sumter County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, under the leadership of Sheriff Jamie Adams and lead investigating officer William O. Farmer, exhumed her body. A forensic anthropologist rendered composite sketches of the woman both at the time of her death and as a child, and the investigator also determined the woman&#x27;s weight and height. In the early 1990s, the American television series &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; featured the case in an episode. Each attempt to identify the woman was unsuccessful.

In 2012, the Sumter County Sheriff&#x27;s Department asked the University of South Florida&#x27;s Tampa Bay Cold Case Project to reexamine the remains of &quot;Little Miss Lake Panasoffkee&quot;. An isotope analysis performed by the project indicated she could have been an immigrant from Greece, possibly hailing from the town of Lavrion (located 60 miles (96 kilometers) southeast of Athens). The victim is believed to have moved to the United States between one and three months prior to her murder. The new information contradicted the Sumter County Sheriff&#x27;s Department&#x27;s initial assumption that the Jane Doe was either white or Native American; they had created composite sketches reflecting those ethnicities. Sumter County authorities determined, based on the time of her death, that she was visiting the Tarpon Springs area for the celebration of Epiphany on January 6, 1971. Based on the information from the forensic analysis, the Sumter County Sheriff&#x27;s Department contacted the Tarpon Springs Police Department and the Greek Orthodox Church about the case and mailed 6,000 flyers to Tarpon Springs businesses and residents. As of 2016, the case is still unsolved.

==Preserves==
The Lake Panasoffkee park and preserve protects and offers birdwatching, biking, camping, horseback riding, fishing, hiking and hunting. It is accessed from the south side of State Route 44 two miles (3 km) west of Interstate 75. Similar recreational opportunities (except no biking) are also offered at the Panasoffkee Outlet park and preserve. Both areas are protected by the Southwest Florida Water Management District.

<text>The Villages is a census-designated place (CDP) in Sumter and Marion counties in the U.S. state of Florida. It shares its name with a broader master-planned, age-restricted community that spreads into portions of Lake County. The overall development lies in central Florida, approximately south of Ocala and approximately northwest of Orlando. As of the 2020 census, the population of the CDP was 79,077.

The Villages covers an area of approximately , and is expanding mainly to the south of the current community. It is made up of 17 special purpose community development districts (CDD), which are controlled by a board of supervisors (BoS), five individuals elected by the landowners of the district. H. Gary Morse, the original owner&#x27;s son, transferred most direct ownership in the company to his three children in 2006.

The community is the center of The Villages metropolitan area, which consists of all of Sumter County and is included in the Orlando–Lakeland–Deltona combined statistical area; and Marion County is included in the Ocala, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. According to May 2023 Census Bureau data, between July 1, 2021, and July 1, 2022, The Villages metro area grew by 7.5% or 10,103 people to 144,970 residents. The area was the fastest-growing metropolitan statistical area in the United States.

== History ==
Harold Schwartz, a Michigan businessman, began selling land tracts via mail order in The Villages area in the 1960s. He and his business partner, Al Tarrson, were forced to close this aspect of the business following the implementation of a 1968 federal law banning real estate sales by mail order.

Stuck with considerable portions of Florida land, in the early 1970s, Schwartz and Tarrson began the development of a mobile home park, &quot;Orange Blossom Gardens&quot;, in the northwestern corner of Lake County. By the early 1980s, the community had sold only 400 units. Schwartz bought out Tarrson&#x27;s interest in improving the business and brought his son, H. Gary Morse, on board in 1983.

Morse noted that the thriving retirement communities (such as Del Webb&#x27;s Sun City developments) offered numerous well-maintained amenities to the residents. They also had diverse and nearby commercial development. Morse began to upgrade the development significantly. Their sales improved in the mid-1980s. Schwartz began to buy large tracts of land in nearby Sumter and Marion counties for future expansion. In 1992, Morse officially changed the overall development name to The Villages. The development is still controlled in all significant aspects by descendants of Schwartz and Morse.

By the early 1990s, The Villages had over 8,000 residents and three golf courses. The first Winn✓Dixie supermarket opened, and just four restaurants and nightly dances were held in a tent.

In 2008, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) notified the Village Center CDD of its intent to audit several recreational bonds issued in 2003 to determine compliance with tax regulations (mainly due to their status as municipal bonds which are exempt from federal income tax). In 2013, the IRS ruled that $426 million in bonds were not tax-free since the bureaucracy running The Villages could not be considered a real government. The Villages&#x27; residents bore approximately $750,000.00 in legal fees defending against the IRS audit.

===Expansion===
In January 2017, the Holding Company of the Villages announced the purchase of 8,000 acres of land south of Florida State Road 44 in and around the villages of Southern Oaks and Fenney. In the spring of 2017, The Villages announced a planned acquisition of 2,600 acres north and south of County Road 470 along the east side of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike for future development. The deal has passed due diligence by the Leesburg City Commission. Zoning ordinance changes were approved by the Leesburg Planning Commission (with the city commission giving final approval). The initial plans call for the building of approximately 4,500 homes with some commercial development also being planned.

According to data from RCLCO Real Estate, the Holding Company of the Villages sold 2,231 homes in 2017, a 13% increase over 2016. The Villages was the top-selling master-planned community in the United States in 2017 and one of only four communities to sell more than 1,000 homes.

The Villages also claimed the title of the best-selling master-planned community of the decade, with 24,440 new home sales from 2010 through 2019.

In January 2024, RCLCO Real Estate Advisors named The Villages the top-selling planned community for the eleventh consecutive year, with 3,029 new homes sold in 2023, a decrease of 23 percent over 2022.

===Structure===
A declaration of restrictions has been created for each neighborhood, which regulates the design and operational aspects, such as landscaping, repairs and maintenance, placement of satellite dishes, hedges, etc. An architectural review committee controls the composition and consistency of the exterior of the residential properties within The Villages. The committee, which consists of &quot;Villages&quot; residents, reviews and approves alterations and modifications to the properties and homes built by the developer. Committee members serve for three years and are selected by the sitting committee.

To qualify for an exception to the Housing for Older Persons Act prohibitions against discrimination, at least 80 percent of the homes within The Villages must have at least one person 55 years of age or older residing in the home. Persons under the age of 19 years are not permitted to reside within The Villages unless an exemption is granted.

===Local government===
The majority of The Villages is developed and maintained using several Community Development Districts (CDD). The CDD is a form of special purpose local government available under Florida law. , around 225 communities in Florida use this form of government. The portion of The Villages located in Lake County is under the jurisdiction of the city of Lady Lake and is not part of any of the district CDDs, but a portion is under the larger CDDs.

The Villages Community Development Districts are special-purpose districts established under Florida State Statutes. There are currently 17 CDDs in The Villages, each with its dedicated board of supervisors. The CDDs are responsible for a variety of functions, including:
* Maintenance of roads, sidewalks, and other public infrastructure
* Provision of recreational facilities and services
* Provision of public safety services, such as fire and emergency medical services
* Provision of sanitation services, such as water and wastewater treatment
* Development and maintenance of open space

The CDDs are funded by a combination of property taxes and user fees. All residents of The Villages pay property taxes, while user fees are paid by residents who use specific CDD-provided services, such as recreation facilities or water and wastewater services. The current district setup is as follows:

The remaining four CDDs are:
* Village Center Community Development District (VCCDD)—Located in Lake, Marion, and Sumter counties, VCCDD provides residents with water and sewer utility services, recreation, security, fire protection, and paramedic services. The cost of operations is funded by amenity and utility fees that residents pay monthly. VCCDD also maintains common areas and roadways for commercial areas within its boundaries. Maintenance costs in commercial areas are funded through commercial maintenance assessments.
* Sumter Landing Community Development District (SLCDD) – located in Sumter County, SLCDD provides recreation and security services to the residents. The cost of operations is funded by amenity fees that residents pay monthly. This CDD also provides for maintaining common areas and roadways for commercial areas within its boundaries. Maintenance costs in commercial areas are funded through commercial maintenance assessments.
* Brownwood Community Development District (BCDD) – located in Sumter County and provides for the maintenance of common areas and roadways for the of commercial areas within its boundaries.
* North Sumter County Utility Dependent District (NSCUDD) – provides water, reclaimed water, and wastewater services to residents of The Villages who are north of county route 466A and south of county route 466. The NSCUDD also provides municipal solid waste disposal for the portions of Sumter County, Marion County, and the City of Fruitland Park, which is inside the boundaries of The Villages.

Unlike the residential CDDs, there are no residents within the CDD boundaries. Thus, each district&#x27;s five-member Board of Supervisors is composed of the developer&#x27;s employees or affiliates.

====Ownership associations====
There are also two homeowners associations in The Villages: The Property Owners Association (POA) and The Villages Homeowners Association (VHA).

He briefly greeted officials and supporters before boarding Marine One and flying to The Villages Polo Club. From there, Trump traveled via motorcade to the Sharon L. Morse Performing Arts Center where he delivered an hour-long speech about expanding Medicare eligibility to an invitation-only audience of roughly 1,000 supporters.

The Villages development is bounded roughly by US 27/US 441 to the east, US 301 to the west, County Road 42 to the north, and County Road 468 well south of 466A with the development of several new villages, Fenney, and the Brownwood town center in that area. On December 10, 2013, The Villages of Lake-Sumter Inc. agreed to an $8 million deal to purchase the Pine Ridge Dairy tract in Fruitland Park, Florida with a planned construction of 2,038 new Villages homes. Although County Road 466 previously served as the central east–west corridor, the addition of homes and facilities south of County Road 466 and in the city of Fruitland Park, Florida has turned County Road 466A into a secondary east–west corridor. Buena Vista Boulevard and Morse Boulevard serve as significant north–south corridors.

The construction of four additional golf cart overpasses were finished between 2020 and 2023. The Chitty Chatty Bridge, crossing Florida State Road 44 near Rohan Recreation Center and Lake Deaton Plaza, opened to traffic in October 2020.

In the early stages of the program, the vehicle will have a safety driver in the driver&#x27;s seat, and later, the driver will be removed, and the automobile will be monitored from a control station. The technology-rich Ford Fusion Hybrid and Chrysler Pacifica minivan taxis will be operated by Voyage Auto, a startup company from San Jose, California. The Villages has a 0.5 percent stake in Voyage Auto.

The Villages became one of the first cities in the United States to offer paid taxi services using autonomous vehicles throughout the community.

==Notable people==
==Criticism==
The effort to present a &quot;fanciful past&quot; for The Villages through fictionalized plaques and building details demonstrates &quot;the role that history plays in retirement migration.&quot; Critics have negatively compared this presentation to the approach of Disney theme parks, claiming that the plaques generally do not address ethnic minorities or conflict. Amanda Brian argued in her book, &quot;The Villages&#x27; &#x27;history&#x27; whitewashes Florida&#x27;s past and celebrates a straightforward tale of economic growth.&quot;

==In popular culture==
* Stand-up comedian Kathleen Madigan has performed a routine whose subject is The Villages
* &quot;Some Kind of Heaven&quot;, a 2020 documentary about The Villages
* &quot;The Bubble&quot;, a 2021 documentary by Austrian director Valerie Blankenbyl

<text>The Sienese school of painting flourished in Siena, Italy, between the 13th and 15th centuries. Its most important artists include Duccio, whose work shows Byzantine influence, his pupil Simone Martini, the brothers Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti and Domenico and Taddeo di Bartolo, Sassetta, and Matteo di Giovanni.

==History==

Duccio may be considered the &quot;father of Sienese painting&quot;. The brothers Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti were &quot;responsible for a crucial development in Sienese art, moving from the tradition inherited from Duccio towards a Gothic style, incorporating the innovations in Florence introduced by Giotto and Arnolfo di Cambio&quot;.

&quot;Sienese art flourished even when Siena itself had begun to decline economically and politically. And while the artists of 15th-century Siena did not enjoy the widespread patronage and respect that their 14th-century ancestors had received, the paintings and illuminated manuscripts they produced form one of the undervalued treasures in the bounty of Italian art.&quot;

In the late 15th century, Siena &quot;finally succumbed&quot; to the Florentine school&#x27;s teachings on perspective and naturalistic representation, absorbing its &quot;humanist culture&quot;. In the 16th century the Mannerists Beccafumi and Il Sodoma worked there. While Baldassare Peruzzi was born and trained in Siena, his major works and style reflect his long career in Rome. The economic and political decline of Siena by the 16th century, and its eventual subjugation by Florence, largely checked the development of Sienese painting, although it also meant that a good proportion of Sienese works in churches and public buildings were not discarded or destroyed.

==Style==
Unlike Florentine art, Sienese art opted for a more decorative style and rich colors, with &quot;thinner, elegant, and courtly figures&quot;. It also has &quot;a mystical streak...characterized by a common focus on miraculous events, with less attention to proportions, distortions of time and place, and often dreamlike coloration&quot;. Sienese painters did not paint portraits, allegories, or classical myths.

On April 27, 2015, The Villages formally withdrew their plans for expansion, indicating that the City of Wildwood officials made too many requests that would be a “disservice to our residents and business partners&quot;.

Wildwood station operates as a CSX maintenance yard, and until 2004, was served by Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Palmetto&quot; between New York City and Tampa. Amtrak&#x27;s Amtrak Thruway bus service makes a stop in Wildwood. The bus travels from Jacksonville to Dade City, and is timed to meet arrivals and departures of the &quot;Silver Star&quot; train in Jacksonville. The Florida Midland Railroad owns an abandoned railroad spur that once led to Leesburg, but now solely serves as a home for several abandoned freight cars along County Road 44A.

In the latter 20th century, Wildwood served as a division point and rail yard for the Seaboard Air Line Railroad (SAL), and later the Seaboard Coast Line (SCL) and Seaboard System Railroads. SAL, SCL and Amtrak passenger trains from New York City and the Midwest were split and combined here to serve St. Petersburg and Miami until the 1990s. Wildwood continues to host Wildwood Yard, which is now used by CSX Transportation, a successor to the Seaboard.

<text>Live Oak is a city and the county seat of Suwannee County, Florida, United States. The city is midway between Tallahassee and Jacksonville. As of 2020, the population recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau was 6,735.

U.S. Highway 90, U.S. Highway 129 and Interstate 10 are major highways running through Live Oak.

Freight service is provided by the Florida Gulf &amp; Atlantic Railroad, which acquired most of the former CSX main line from Pensacola to Jacksonville on June 1, 2019.

It is served by the Suwannee County Airport as well as many private airparks scattered throughout the county.

There is also a community named Live Oak in Washington County, Florida.

==History==

===19th century===

Built along the Pensacola &amp; Georgia Railroad in or prior to 1861, Live Oak was named for a southern live oak tree under which railroad workers rested and ate lunch. When a railroad depot was built nearby, the small community that sprang up around it was called “Live Oak Station” (first mentioned in records in 1861). The tree was at the site of the present-day Pepe&#x27;s Mexican Grocery on U.S. 90.

During the Civil War, the Pensacola &amp; Georgia Railroad served as a vital route for parts of North Florida. Defensive earthworks were built where it crossed the Suwannee River west of Live Oak, to deter Union attacks. These earthworks still exist as part of the Suwannee River State Park, one of Florida&#x27;s first State parks. 

To ease supply problems to other parts of the Confederacy, the Confederate government decided to create a north–south railroad link into Georgia through Live Oak. The railroad junction was completed in early 1865. It was too late to help the Confederacy, but it opened up the interior of the county to settlement in the postwar period.

An infamous resident of the town was Lewis Powell, one of John Wilkes Booth&#x27;s co-conspirators in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. At the age of 13, he had moved with his family from Alabama to Live Oak. He lived there until the age of 17, when he lied about his age to enlist with the 2nd Florida Infantry Regiment in the Confederate army.

In 1868 the legislature designated Live Oak as the county seat of Suwannee County. An election held the following year confirmed Live Oak as the county seat, and it has continued in this role. Live Oak was incorporated as a town in 1878. In 1903, it was incorporated as a city and was the largest community in Suwannee County. It served as a minor railroad hub for the region.

During Reconstruction, Live Oak suffered extensive violence by white supremacists against Black citizens. They attacked and assaulted Blacks to discourage their voting, to maintain dominance, and to expel Blacks from the community.

===20th century===

In the 1905 State census, Live Oak was the fifth-largest city in Florida (behind Jacksonville, Pensacola, Tampa, and Key West, in that order), and the largest inland city. Nearby resorts at Suwannee Springs and Dowling Park (formerly Hudson-upon-the-Suwannee) drew thousands of visitors from around the world to the sulfur springs and related nearby sports, boating, and hunting activities. The health benefits of the springs were touted in magazines and newspapers worldwide, supposedly curing everything from arthritis to “female problems”.

During the first decade of the twentieth century, Live Oak saw a construction boom. Notable buildings such as the Suwannee County Courthouse, Live Oak City Hall, and Suwannee Hotel were completed. Dozens of fine two- and three-story homes were erected along the major streets. By 1913, the main streets were bricked and a sewage system had been built.

Live Oak was surpassed as a destination when explosive growth occurred in south Florida. At the same time, people lost belief in the healing power of sulfur waters. Cotton crops were devastated by the boll weevil near the end of the First World War, which nearly finished off the economies of the city and county. Business stagnated with the coming of the Great Depression. 

But, despite their relatively small populations, Live Oak and Suwannee County remained politically powerful for another four decades. The white and rural-dominated state legislature had resisted the required redistricting that would follow demographic changes throughout the state. Finally, after a United States Supreme Court ruling in 1964 for &quot;one person, one vote&quot;, the state legislature redistricted. Southern Florida received its due in the number of state and congressional representatives to reflect its greatly increased population in relation to other areas of the state. 

Ruby Strickland, former postmistress of the community of Dowling Park, was elected as mayor of Live Oak in 1924. She was the first female elected as mayor south of the Mason–Dixon line after universal suffrage was enacted in 1919. Strickland served two non-consecutive terms and represented the area at the Democratic National Convention of 1936.

In 1940, the men of the local National Guard unit, Company E of the 124th Infantry (historically called the Suwannee Rifles), were mustered into service for one year of training at Camp Blanding, Florida. A week after the December 7, 1941 surprise Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, the unit was assigned to the 31st Division at Fort Benning, Georgia, to serve as a model infantry training unit. The unit was briefly deactivated in 1944, but reactivated the following month after many of the original men had been dispersed to other units; members served in both the European and Pacific theaters of war during World War II.

Florida National Guard historian Robert Hawk noted that, &quot;In the course of the Second World War, no unit of the Florida National Guard had more men killed, wounded in action, or dead from other causes than Company E, 124th Infantry.&quot; The Live Oak unit was reorganized several times over the years as infantry, tank, and engineering companies; as of 2019, it served as the 868th Engineer Company. The unit has purportedly been called up to serve more than any other unit in Florida.

In 1944, 15 year-old African American Willie James Howard was lynched in Live Oak, ostensibly for having &quot;expressed his affections&quot; to a white girl. He was murdered by a group of white men including the girl&#x27;s father, former state legislator A.P. &quot;Phil&quot; Goff. They kidnapped Howard, bound him, and forced him to jump off a bridge. A Suwannee County grand jury failed to indict Goff or the other white men. Media attention to Live Oak in the aftermath of the death of Willie James Howard increased awareness of lynching in the United States.

In 1948, Live Oak and Suwannee County received their first public hospital. It was completed under the Hill-Burton Act, which provided Federal funding for health care facilities to rural areas. The Suwannee County Hospital was initially segregated, and served only white citizens of the region until after passage of civil rights legislation in the 1960s. African Americans went to Brewster Hospital. The Suwanee County facility was replaced in the early 1990s.

In 1952, national attention was drawn to Live Oak and the county when Ruby McCollum, a wealthy African American, shot and killed Dr. Clifford Leroy Adams, Jr. He was a prominent, white, recently elected to the state senate. The fatal shooting took place in his medical office, across from the Suwannee County Courthouse. Investigators at first thought the shooting was related to an unpaid doctor&#x27;s bill.

But it was soon revealed that the married Dr. Adams had fathered a child with McCollum, who was also married. She testified that he forced her into a sexual relationship. (Adams knew that her husband Sam oversaw an illegal &quot;bolita&quot; gaming operation and was said to benefit by it as well). Author Zora Neale Hurston was covering the trial for the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot; and characterized this abuse of an African-American woman by a powerful white man as an assertion of &quot;paramour rights&quot;, which had also existed in the South under slavery.

McCollum&#x27;s murder conviction and death sentence were overturned on a technicality in 1954. Before a second trial, her defense attorney gained a certification that she was mentally unfit to stand trial. She was held for the next twenty years in the Florida State Mental Hospital in Chattahoochee. She was released to her family after being assessed as no danger to herself or anyone else. The murder and events surrounding it have been the subject of numerous books and documentaries in the 21st century.

In the 1950s, the rest of Suwannee County received electricity and telephone service, something the City of Live Oak had since the late 1800s. In 1957, the Florida Sheriffs Association received property north of Live Oak for use as a Boys’ Ranch. Opening in 1958, this facility has continued to be used to help troubled boys from all of Florida; later, a Girls&#x27; Ranch and Youth Villa were constructed in other parts of the state for girls and sibling groups.

In September 1964, Hurricane Dora dumped massive amounts of water on Live Oak, flooding major intersections and leaving the downtown area partially submerged. The damage led to the abandonment or tearing down of several historic buildings and the relocation of other businesses to higher ground.

In 1983, the Suwannee County Development Authority opened a park north of Live Oak along the banks of the Suwannee River. This park was little developed until being sold to private individuals in the 1990s. Renamed and developed as the Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park, it hosts music festivals for all types of music, drawing hundreds of thousands of visitors to the area annually.

===21st century===

Tropical Storm Debby (2012) surpassed the amount of rain brought by Hurricane Dora, and despite vastly improved drainage, much of Live Oak once again flooded. Interstates were shut down as portions were underwater, and much of the surrounding area was cut off from the outside world. In addition, dozens of sinkholes, some quite large, opened up all over the city and county, causing further damage. Several downtown buildings that were more than 100 years old were impacted and later torn down, replaced by public parks for community events.

Live Oak remains the largest community and only full-fledged city in Suwannee County. Eco-tourism in and around Live Oak brings thousands of people from all over the country to places such as the nearby Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park, the Suwannee River State Park, and numerous springs along the famed Suwannee River. In addition, agriculture-related business (including timber, pine straw, and watermelons) is still the dominant industry in Suwannee County, with international companies like Klausner Lumber making their home in and around Live Oak.

==Geography==

Geographically, Suwannee County is situated on a limestone bed riddled with underground freshwater streams, which surface in dozens of beautiful springs. This phenomenon of &quot;Karst topography&quot; gives the area a local supply of renewable fresh water and abundant sources of fishing. The county is known as a world-class cave diving site for SCUBA enthusiasts, and underwater cave explorer Sheck Exley chose to live here in order to have close access to many of the springs.

Fishing sites include a number of small lakes about 5 miles east of the town. Suwannee Lake is the most well stocked and notable, but there is also Workman Lake, Dexter Lake, Campground Lake, Little Lake Hull, White Lake, Tiger Lake, Bachelor Lake, and Peacock Lake.

The Twin Rivers State Forest is a Florida State forest located in North Central Florida, near Live Oak.

== Climate ==

Live Oak has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;).

==Library==

===History===

The City of Live Oak is the headquarters for the Suwannee River Regional Library System.

Live Oak had a small town library up until the 1940s, which was financed by the County with $25 a month. This first library was a small wooden structure located on the corner of Pine and Wilbur, originally used as the public restrooms for white women.

In 1948, a library annex was included in the building expansion program by the Board of County Commissioners. This building was made of brick and housed the public restroom for white women, a draft board office, and the library. The draft board office and library shared space and personnel until the Fall of 1954. In October 1954, half a million dollars was budgeted by the County Commissioners, and the City Council approved $500 annually for the operation of the Suwannee County Free Library.

The library opened on February 28, 1955, and had a collection of 3,100 books, some of which they borrowed from the State Library. Mrs. Sara Rogers became the first librarian after resigning her position as Chairman of the Woman’s Club Library Project Committee. Rogers resigned on April 6, 1956, to become postmistress, and was succeeded by Mrs. W.D. Richardson on March 15, 1957.

In an effort to receive federal funds, the Suwannee Board convinced Lafayette County to join in a regional library cooperative in 1957. In 1958, the first regional library system was established in Florida, servicing Lafayette and Suwannee counties.

By 1958, the library&#x27;s collection had grown from 3,100 books to 10,000, and a bookmobile was established. In 1959, the regional library system grew to include seven different counties. On July 20, 1959, the Suwannee River Regional Library Board hosted the five incoming counties who all officially joined October 1, 1959. In 1960, the main library was located in Live Oak, with eight local units, consisting of over 23,500 books. The Miami Public Library gave 3,000 of those as a gift. The start of construction on the new Suwannee River Regional Library on Ohio Avenue South began on January 4, 1996, and the new building was dedicated on November 24, 1996. At that time, students included a time capsule to be opened on December 16, 2045, during Florida’s Bicentennial.

===Awards===

In April 1960, the Book-of the-Month Club awarded the Suwannee River Regional Library with the Dorothy Canfield Fisher Award. In the U.S., there were only eight rural libraries to qualify and receive the award, and the Suwannee River Regional Library was the only one from the south to be nominated and win the $1,000 prize.

On April 7, 1992, the Suwannee County Commission signed a resolution honoring the people responsible for the library’s thirty-five years of operation.

In 2009, the Suwannee River Regional Library was one of two-hundred and eight nationwide institutions to win a Big Read grant and The Maltese Falcon was chosen as the book to highlight. The library hosted a 1930s themed kick-off party on February 5, 2009 that turned into a monthlong &quot;whodunit&quot; when the model display Maltese Falcon was disappeared during festivities. The library used the grant to start a tween book club and created programs for middle and high school students including podcasts, art projects, and a film noir marathon. The library distributed three-hundred copies of The Maltese Falcon to the community with additional copies going to the high school and eleven life-size cut-outs of Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade were distributed throughout town to garner interest.

<text>Perry is a city and the county seat of Taylor County, Florida, United States. , the population recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau was 6,898. The city was named for Madison Perry, fourth governor of the state of Florida and a Confederate colonel during the American Civil War.

==History==
In 1922, Perry was a very small town of less than 2,000 people. During this time, a murder happened and three people were lynched for the crimes. Private retribution against the suspected families and those that gave them support ensued. The Perry Massacre occurred in Perry on the 14th and 15 December 1922, during which whites hanged Charles Wright and attacked the blacks of Perry after the murder of a white schoolteacher. On the day following Wright&#x27;s lynching two more black men were shot and hanged; whites then burned the town&#x27;s black school, Masonic lodge, church, amusement hall, and several families&#x27; homes.

Firefighters battling a blaze at a natural gas plant in August 1998 were injured when an explosion ripped through the area, sending a mammoth fireball into the sky. The flames destroyed at least six houses and several vehicles and forced the evacuation of 100 homes within two miles of the plant. Four firefighters were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries.

In August 2023, Hurricane Idalia impacted Florida. Perry was in the path of the storm and suffered damage across the city. 

In September 2024, Hurricane Helene made landfall near Perry as a Category 4-strength storm, causing major damage and loss of power.

<text>Daytona Beach is a coastal resort city in Volusia County, Florida, United States. Located on the East Coast of the United States, its population was 72,647 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Deltona–Daytona Beach–Ormond Beach metropolitan area, and is a principal city of the Fun Coast region of Florida.

Daytona Beach is historically known for its beach, where motorized vehicles are permitted on some hard-packed sand beaches. Motorsports on the beach became popular, and the Daytona Beach and Road Course hosted races for over 50 years, replaced in 1959 by Daytona International Speedway. The city is the headquarters of NASCAR.

Daytona Beach hosts large groups of tourists, and notable events include Speedweeks which attracts 200,000 visitors to the Daytona 500. Other events include the NASCAR Coke Zero Sugar 400, Daytona Beach Bike Week, Biketoberfest, and the 24 Hours of Daytona endurance race.

==History==


The area where Daytona Beach is located was once inhabited by the indigenous Timucuan Indians, who lived in fortified villages. The Timucuas were nearly exterminated by contact with Europeans through war, enslavement, and disease and became extinct as a racial entity through assimilation and attrition during the 18th century. The Seminole Indians, descendants of Creek Indians from Georgia and Alabama, frequented the area prior to the Second Seminole War.

During the era of British rule of Florida between 1763 and 1783, the King&#x27;s Road passed through present-day Daytona Beach. The road extended from Saint Augustine, the capital of East Florida, to Andrew Turnbull&#x27;s experimental colony in New Smyrna. In 1804, Samuel Williams received a land grant of from the Spanish Crown, which had regained Florida from the British after the American Revolutionary War. This land grant encompassed the area that would become Daytona Beach. Williams built a slave labor-based plantation to grow cotton, rice, and sugar cane. His son Samuel Hill Williams abandoned the plantation during the Second Seminole War, when the Seminoles burned it to the ground.

The area now known as the Daytona Beach Historical District was once the Orange Grove Plantation, a citrus and sugarcane plantation granted to Samuel Williams in 1787. The plantation was situated on the west bank of the tidal channel known as the Halifax River, 12 miles north of Mosquito Inlet. Williams was a British loyalist from North Carolina who fled to the Bahamas with his family until the Spanish reopened Florida to non-Spanish immigration. After his death in 1810, the plantation was run by his family until it was burned down in 1835. In 1871, Mathias Day Jr. of Mansfield, Ohio, purchased the 3,200-acre tract of the former Orange Grove Plantation. He built a hotel around which the initial section of town arose. In 1872, due to financial troubles, Day lost title to his land; nonetheless, residents decided to name the city Daytona in his honor, and incorporated the town in 1876.

In 1886, the St. Johns &amp; Halifax River Railway arrived in Daytona. The line was purchased in 1889 by Henry M. Flagler, who made it part of his Florida East Coast Railway. The separate towns of Daytona, Daytona Beach, Kingston, and Seabreeze merged as &quot;Daytona Beach&quot; in 1926, at the urging of civic leader J. B. Kahn and others. By the 1920s, it was dubbed &quot;the World&#x27;s Most Famous Beach&quot;.

Daytona&#x27;s wide beach of smooth, compacted sand attracted automobile and motorcycle races beginning in 1902, as pioneers in the industry tested their inventions. It hosted land speed record attempts beginning in 1904, when William K. Vanderbilt set an unofficial record of . Land speed racers from Barney Oldfield to Henry Segrave to Malcolm Campbell would visit Daytona repeatedly and make the beach course famous. Record attempts, including numerous fatal endeavors such as Frank Lockhart (Stutz Black Hawk, 1928) and Lee Bible (&quot;Triplex Special&quot;, 1929), would continue until Campbell&#x27;s March 7, 1935 effort, which set the record at and marked the end of Daytona&#x27;s land speed racing days.

On March 8, 1936, the first stock car race was held on the Daytona Beach Road Course, located in the present-day Town of Ponce Inlet. In 1958, William France Sr. and NASCAR created the Daytona International Speedway to replace the beach course. Automobiles are still permitted on most areas of the beach, at a maximum speed of .

The city of Daytona Beach made national headlines in 2005, when it designated the several–mile radius around Main Street on the barrier island portion of the city as a blighted area and has targeted it for redevelopment by private developers. This follows the Supreme Court decision of the eminent domain case in &quot;Kelo v. City of New London&quot;, which upheld the right of municipalities to use eminent domain to take private property for redevelopment by private entities.

The city of Daytona Beach is split in two by the Halifax River lagoon, part of the Intracoastal Waterway, and sits on the Atlantic Ocean. It is bordered on the north by Holly Hill and Ormond Beach and on the south by Daytona Beach Shores, South Daytona, and Port Orange.

Notable weather events that have caused damage or injury in Daytona Beach include Hurricane Donna in 1960, the 1998 Kissimmee tornado outbreak, and Hurricane Charley in 2004. In 1992, a long rogue wave with a high crest hit Daytona Beach, causing property damage and 75 reported injuries.

It is the only month where the average high temperature falls below . Occasional cold fronts can bring freezes, which from 1991 to 2020 were seen on an average of 3.0 nights annually; however, minima below are very rare, and were last seen on December 28, 2010. Like much of Florida, Daytona Beach often can be very dry in late winter and early spring, and brush fires and water restrictions can be an issue.

Official record temperatures range from on January 21, 1985, up to on July 15, 1981, and June 24, 1944; the record cold daily maximum is on Christmas Day 1983, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is on September 1 and 10–11, 2008, and August 25, 2020. Annual rainfall has ranged from in 2006 and 1956, up to in 1953.

===Law enforcement===

Law enforcement in Daytona Beach is provided by the 241-member Daytona Beach Police Department (DBPD) headed by police chief Craig Capri. In a unique and controversial program to help fund the Police Explorer program, run by a subsidiary of the Boy Scouts of America, T-shirts with the words &quot;Scumbag Eradication Team&quot;: &quot;Not in Our Town&quot; are sold at the police headquarters.

The T-shirts contain a caricature of retired Chief Chitwood standing next to a toilet bowl with the legs of multiple individuals sticking out. The T-shirt has been cited in at least one lawsuit against the DBPD alleging police brutality; the lawyer in the case in which the client sustained broken ribs and a fractured eye socket during an arrest for an open container of beer, claims the T-shirt shows the DBPD condones violence.

The Volusia County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, headed by Mike Chitwood, is a county-wide law enforcement agency with 446 sworn positions, 438 civilian employees, 300 volunteers, and an annual operating budget of $73 million that has jurisdiction in unincorporated areas of Volusia County and provides additional law enforcement support to Daytona Beach during such events as the Daytona 500 and aids in joint investigations of certain crimes.

The Volusia County Beach Patrol provides law enforcement and EMT services along Volusia County beaches, including the beaches in the city of Daytona Beach.

===Healthcare===

Healthcare in Daytona Beach is dominated by Halifax Health (formerly known as Halifax Hospital). The Halifax Hospital Taxing District was established in 1927 by an act of the Florida Legislature as a public hospital district. Dozens of individual practitioners and professional associations are in the Daytona Beach area.

===Utilities===
Basic utilities in Daytona Beach (water and sewer) are provided by the city government.
* Florida Power &amp; Light is Daytona Beach&#x27;s local electric power provider.
* TECO/People&#x27;s Gas is Daytona Beach&#x27;s natural gas provider. 
* Spectrum and AT&amp;T networks are Daytona Beach&#x27;s local cable providers.
* AT&amp;T (formerly BellSouth) is Daytona Beach&#x27;s local phone provider.
The city has a successful recycling program with separate pickups for garbage, yard waste, and recycling. Collection is provided by several private companies under contract to Volusia County.

===Transportation===
====Airports====

Passenger airline services are located at Daytona Beach International Airport (DAB), which is centrally located within the city adjacent to Daytona International Speedway. The site was first used as an airport with terminals being constructed in 1952 and 1958. The present facility was constructed in 1992 at the cost of $46 million, and includes both a domestic terminal and an International terminal. Despite the new facilities, DAB has found difficulty in attracting and retaining carriers; Continental Airlines, AirTran Airways, and United Airlines discontinued flights to Daytona in 2007 and 2008. LTU and American Airlines also serviced Daytona Beach during the 1980s and 1990s, both of which ended all flights in 1994 and 1997, respectively.

Current passenger airlines serving DAB include Delta Air Lines (with nonstop service to Atlanta) and American Airlines (with nonstop service to Charlotte). Both carriers offer connecting service from those cities to destinations worldwide. International flights from DAB fly to destinations in the Bahamas through air taxi and charter services Airgate Aviation and IslandPass; non-stop flights are available from DAB to Marsh Harbour, Treasure Cay, and North Eleuthera. Sunwing Airlines also operates seasonal flights from Toronto Pearson International Airport. DAB is also heavily used for general aviation, largely due to Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University, whose campus is located at the airport.

Larger airports nearby are Orlando International Airport and Jacksonville International Airport, each of which is about 90 minutes away.

====Buses====
* Daytona Beach is served by Greyhound Bus Lines, which has a terminal located at 138 South Ridgewood Avenue (US 1). The Greyhound routes from Daytona Beach connect with hubs in Jacksonville and Orlando.
* Votran is the local bus service provided by Volusia County.

====Automobiles====
Daytona Beach is easily accessible by I-95 that runs north and south and I-4 connecting Daytona Beach with Orlando and Tampa. US 1 (Ridgewood Avenue) also passes north–south through Daytona Beach. US 92 (International Speedway Boulevard) runs east–west through Daytona Beach. SR A1A is a scenic north–south route along the beach.

The Volusia County Parking Garage is located at 701 Earl Street at North Atlantic Avenue (SR A1A). The garage is strategically located, next to the Ocean Center, Daytona Lagoon, and across the street from the Hilton Hotel and Ocean Walk Shoppes. Over 1000 parking spaces are available inside the garage, which also houses an intermodal transfer station for VoTran.

====Bridges====
Four bridges cross over the Halifax River (and Intracoastal Waterway) at Daytona Beach. They include (starting from furthest downstream) the Veterans Memorial Bridge (which carries CR 4050 traffic), the Broadway Bridge (which carries US 92 traffic), the Main Street Bridge (which carries CR 4040 traffic), and the Seabreeze Bridge (which carries SR 430 traffic). All four bridges charge no toll to traffic. In June, 2016, the Veterans Memorial Bridge was closed as part of a three-year project to demolish the drawbridge and replace it with a high span bridge.

====Rail====

Passenger railroad service to Daytona Beach was established no later than 1889 by the Jacksonville, St. Augustine and Halifax River Railway, predecessor of the Florida East Coast Railroad . Long-distance trains such as the &quot;City of Miami&quot; and the &quot;South Wind&quot; (both from Chicago), &quot;East Coast Champion&quot; (from New York City) and the &quot;Havana Special&quot; (New York City) made stops at Daytona Beach. Long distance routes were diverted to Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and Seaboard Air Line Railroad routes on the Florida interior south of the Jacksonville Union Station, following the beginning of a labor dispute on the FEC in 1963. Passenger trains continued calling at Daytona Beach until July 31, 1968, when the FEC terminated passenger operations system-wide. The FEC currently operates freight trains through Daytona Beach.

Daytona Beach is served by Amtrak by way of an Amtrak Thruway connection between the beachside and Amtrak&#x27;s DeLand station, to the west. There, the service connects northbound with train 92, the &quot;Silver Star&quot;, and train 98, the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot;. Southbound connections from Daytona Beach are limited to &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; southbound train 97. The DeLand – Daytona Beach service is Amtrak&#x27;s only Florida Amtrak Thruway route provided by a taxicab, rather than a bus.

Several movies have been based on Daytona Beach, usually with a racing theme. The most recent example was the 1990 hit &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;, parts of which were filmed in Daytona Beach and nearby DeLand. Chris Rea wrote the song &quot;Daytona&quot;, which was in his 1989 album &quot;The Road to Hell&quot;. Suzi Quatro&#x27;s song &quot;Daytona Demon&quot; is often believed to refer to the city. Also, about half of the video for the song &quot;Steal My Sunshine&quot; by Len was filmed at Daytona Beach.

<text>Worthington Springs is a spring and town in Union County, Florida, United States. It is part of the North Florida region. The population was 378 at the 2020 census. 

==History==
The community was named for early settler Sam Worthington, who arrived prior to the first Seminole War of 1814–1819. The mineral spring on the Santa Fe River was alleged to have medicinal benefits, attracting people from the late 1800s to the early 1900s. In the early years, swimming was segregated, with men and women assigned specific time intervals. In 1906, the new owner constructed a 12&#x27;×12&#x27; concrete box around the spring to divert water into a 90&#x27;×50&#x27; concrete pool with a wall dividing the bathing area into sections for men and women. The complex included a hotel, recreation hall and bathhouse for the spring pool.
Independence Day was always a big celebration at the springs. Thousands of people from surrounding communities would converge on the springs to picnic, swim, politic, and converse with friends and fellow Floridians. A special train transported people from Jacksonville for the holiday festivities.

An iron and timber bridge was built across the river in 1908, facilitating access to and from the south. It was replaced in 1937 with the present concrete structure. In the mid-twentieth century, the outflow from the spring declined, and then stopped flowing completely. Activity at the resort likewise curtailed, and the facility was abandoned. The area around the Santa Fe River is subject to periodic flooding, just as the flow at the spring varies widely. In 1972, flow was measured at 233,280 gallons per day.

The Town of Worthington Springs was incorporated in 1963 with a Mayor–council government. Street lights were installed, and a playground was created in the town park. In 1975, a Community Center was built the included government offices for a City Hall.

<text>DeBary is a city in Volusia County, Florida, United States, on the eastern shore of the St. Johns River near Lake Monroe. According to the 2020 U.S. Census, the city had a population of 20,696. It is part of the Deltona–Daytona Beach–Ormond Beach, FL metropolitan statistical area, which was home to 553,284 people in 2019.

==History==
The Timucuan Indians once lived in the vicinity of Lake Monroe, where the domain of Chief Utina extended to just north of Lake George. They hunted, fished, and gathered plants and berries from the forest. By 1760, however, the Timucua had disappeared and been replaced by the Seminole tribe from Alabama and Georgia. Florida was acquired from Spain in 1821, but the Seminole Wars delayed settlement. In 1866, Elijah Watson of Enterprise sold land to Oliver and Amanda Arnett on the northern shore of the St. Johns River at Lake Monroe, where they built a house.

The couple in turn sold in 1871 to (Samuel) Frederick deBary, a wealthy wine merchant from New York City, and that same year, he erected a hunting lodge. Called &quot;DeBary Hall&quot;, the 8,000-sq-ft (700-m2), 20-room Italianate mansion featured a two-tiered veranda, stables, an ice house, and the state&#x27;s first swimming pool, fed by a spring. Visitors included Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Grover Cleveland. Over time, he acquired an additional , planting orange groves and pecan trees. Some debate remains as to whether this was actually the first pool in Florida, as a St. Augustine pool has also made the same claim. One possibility is that this was the first spring-fed pool in the state, 
In 1875, deBary bought a small steamboat, the &quot;George M. Bird&quot;, to transport his horses and dogs along the St. Johns River for hunting expeditions, and also to take fruit to market. He established the DeBary Merchants&#x27; Line in 1876, a steamship service contracted to carry mail between Jacksonville and Enterprise. It acquired the sidewheeler &quot;Frederick DeBary&quot;. In 1883, the firm merged with the Baya Line, owned by Colonel H.T. Baya, to create the DeBary-Baya Merchants&#x27; Line, with 13 steamboats and a crew of 3,000 running to Sanford. The DeBary-Baya Merchants&#x27; Line sold its business in 1889 to the Clyde Line, which survived until 1928.

Frederick deBary died in 1898, and his mansion is today a restored museum, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. The estate, reduced to , now features the community&#x27;s oldest building, the Arnett House. Incorporated in 1993, the City of DeBary is named for its noted settler.

<text>DeLand is a city in and the county seat of Volusia County, Florida, United States. The city sits approximately north of the central business district of Orlando, and approximately west of the central business district of Daytona Beach. It is a part of the Deltona–Daytona Beach–Ormond Beach metropolitan area. As of the 2020 U.S. census, the population was 37,351.

The city was founded in 1876, and was named for its founder, Henry Addison DeLand. DeLand is home to Stetson University, Florida&#x27;s oldest private college, as well as the Museum of Art - DeLand. The DeLand Municipal Airport serves as an uncontrolled general aviation reliever airport to commercial operations at Daytona Beach International Airport (DAB), Orlando Sanford International Airport (SFB) and Orlando International Airport (MCO).

==History==

DeLand was previously known as &quot;Persimmon Hollow&quot; for the wild persimmon trees that grow around the natural springs, and the area was originally accessible only by steamboat up the St. Johns River.

The first settler in the area was probably Ruben Marsh. He first came to Florida during the Seminole Indian War in 1841, during a scouting party that stopped at a lake area within the modern city limits, and in 1846, when the war ended, Ruben Marsh got married and moved to what is now known as DeLand. He bought a settlers claim, where he built a cabin for his family and started raising livestock.

Henry Addison DeLand, a baking soda magnate from Fairport, New York, visited there in 1876, and envisioned building a citrus, agricultural and tourism center. He sold his northern business and hired people to clear land, lay out streets, erect buildings and recruit settlers, most of whom came from upstate New York (though DeLand never lived in the city year-round). On December 6, 1876, at 2:00 PM, the settlers decided to rename the community from &quot;Persimmon Hollow&quot; to &quot;DeLand&quot;, in honor of him founding and helping develop its infrastructure.

In 1877, DeLand built a public school for the town. To enhance the community&#x27;s stature and culture, and to enhance the value of his local real estate holdings, in 1883 DeLand established DeLand Academy, Florida&#x27;s first private college. However, in 1885, a freeze destroyed the orange crop. One story has it that DeLand had guaranteed settlers&#x27; investments as an inducement to relocate, and so was obligated to buy back their ruined groves, though there is no hard evidence that this took place. As for many other would-be real estate magnates in the area at the time, his Florida investments were nearly worthless after the freeze, and he returned to his home in the North. DeLand entrusted the academy to his friend John B. Stetson, a wealthy hat manufacturer from Philadelphia and one of the institution&#x27;s founding trustees. In 1889, it was renamed John B. Stetson University in its patron&#x27;s honor. In 1900, it founded the first law school in Florida (which relocated to Gulfport in 1954). Its various sports teams are called the Hatters.

The community was officially incorporated as the &quot;City of DeLand&quot; in 1882, and became the county seat of Volusia County in 1887. It was the first city in Florida to have electricity. According to city officials, minutes of the first City Commission meeting in 1882 show the city decided to create a seal with the emblems of &quot;Faith, Hope and Charity,&quot; namely a cross, an anchor and a heart.

The city seal was briefly the object of a controversy in 2013, when the national group Americans United for Separation of Church and State sent the city a letter in which they argued that the seal unconstitutionally promotes Christianity, thus allegedly breaching the First Amendment Establishment Clause. The controversy faded after the city refused to change the seal.

During the 1920s Florida Land Boom, fine examples of stucco Mediterranean Revival architecture by native architect Medwin Peek and others were constructed in DeLand. Many of these buildings have been handsomely restored, including the restored Athens Theatre.

Since 1992, the city has hosted the DeLand Fall Festival of the Arts, a two-day event held annually in the historic downtown area on the weekend before Thanksgiving. As of 2009, the event has an annual attendance of more than 50,000 during the weekend.

In 2001, , a California artist, urban designer and filmmaker, bought 27 dilapidated structures, renamed the area the Garden District, and lobbied to create a new historic district. During the following eight years, he restored or rebuilt 32 homes and businesses, which have become the core of a neighborhood revival. The feature-length documentary film &quot;New Urban Cowboy: Toward a New Pedestrianism&quot; tells the story of DeLand and the Garden District. The film premiered in DeLand in January 2009 at the newly restored Athens Theatre. Previously, the film had appeared in seven film festivals and received the Audience Choice Award at the Real to Reel International Film Festival in 2008.

==Sister city==

DeLand is a sister city of Belén, Costa Rica

==Sports and recreation==
DeLand hosts all home games for Stetson University Hatters athletic teams. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams play at the J. Ollie Edmunds Center, an on-campus arena which opened in 1974 and seats approximately 5,000 spectators.

The Hatters baseball team plays at Melching Field at Conrad Park, a 2,500-seat ballpark located off campus just south of downtown DeLand. Melching Field was built in 1999 and is recognized as one of the finer college baseball venues in the NCAA, having hosted numerous Atlantic Sun Conference championships, the 2018 NCAA Baseball Regionals, and other baseball related tournaments and events. Prior to the opening of Melching Field, the Hatters played at old Conrad Park on the same site, which also hosted spring training games in the 1940s and 1950s and the DeLand Red Hats, a Florida State League minor league franchise.

Adjacent to Melching Field is Spec Martin Stadium, a 6,000-seat football stadium. Spec Martin Stadium hosts DeLand High School Bulldog football and soccer games, and serves as home of the Stetson University Hatters football team. Stetson had discontinued its football program in the early 1960s, but reinstated the sport in 2013, when it joined the Pioneer Football League. As part of Stetson&#x27;s re-entry into college football, Spec Martin Stadium underwent significant renovations, including a new press box, handicapped and premium seating areas, and new locker room facilities.

DeLand has been called the &quot;skydiving capital of the world&quot;, with the majority of skydiving industries calling it home. The skydiving industry employs over 500 workers from the DeLand area. This in combination with the tourist end of the industry makes it one of the town&#x27;s largest supporters and invaluable to the local economy.

The Central Florida Warriors of the USA Rugby League are based in DeLand.

==In the movies==
DeLand has been the filming location for a number of television and movie projects, including the 1999 Adam Sandler comedy &quot;The Waterboy&quot;. Scenes showing the fictional South Central Louisiana State University Mud Dogs home football games were shot at Spec Martin Stadium. Classroom and exterior scenes were filmed at Stetson University. Scenes involving Sandler&#x27;s character&#x27;s home were actually filmed in neighboring DeBary. 

&quot;Ghost Story&quot;, starring Fred Astaire, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr and Craig Wasson, was filmed in part at Stetson University and the Holiday House.

The HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; filmed several scenes on the campus of Stetson University. The 1999 independent film &quot;The First of May&quot;, starring Mickey Rooney and Joe DiMaggio, was shot on various locations throughout DeLand. &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;, starring Tom Cruise, was partially filmed in DeLand.

&quot;New Urban Cowboy: Toward a New Pedestrianism&quot; (2008) was filmed almost entirely in DeLand in 2006 and 2007.

&quot;Walt Before Mickey&quot; filmed several scenes at the Stetson University campus in 2014 and Athens Theatre.

==Transportation==
===Rail and public transportation===

Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, serves DeLand, operating its &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; and &quot;Silver Star&quot; trains daily in both directions between Miami and New York City. Since August 12th, 2024, the station has been the northern terminus of Orlando&#x27;s SunRail commuter rail system, with service approximately every hour on weekdays only. The line is primarily CSX&#x27;s Sanford Subdivision. It also contains a spur leading from the station which was built by the Orange Ridge, DeLand and Atlantic Railroad and has received passenger service in the past.

Local transit service is provided by VOTRAN on the #20 and #60 routes.

===Aviation===
During World War II, the Babcock Airplane Corporation manufactured 60 Waco CG-4 assault gliders at DeLand, but the firm was out of business by 1945.

The DeLand Municipal Airport (a.k.a.; Sidney H. Taylor Field) still operates as a general aviation airport as well as a reliever airport for Orlando and Daytona Beach. It also contains the DeLand Naval Air Station Museum.

===Roads===
* The major US highways through DeLand are US 17 (hidden SR 15) and 92 (hidden SR 600), which overlap each other from Lake Alfred in Polk County to the northern part of the city. From here, US 92 turns east onto International Speedway Boulevard toward Daytona Beach, while US 17 continues north towards Barberville, Jacksonville, and along the coast of Georgia, the Carolinas and southern Virginia.
* The main west-to-east state highway in DeLand is Florida State Road 44 which runs along New York Avenue. SR 44 intersects US 17/92 in Downtown DeLand but making turns at the intersection is prohibited. Access between the two road requires taking side roads within the vicinity.
* is an alternate route of SR 15, one of the two hidden state roads along US 17 and 92. It runs along the west side of the city, and also serves as an undesignated truck bypass for US 17/92, as well as SR 44. North of International Speedway Boulevard (Volusia CR 92) and the city line, it is strictly a truck detour for US 17.

<text>Deltona is a city in Volusia County, Florida, United States. It is located on the northern shore of Lake Monroe. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 93,692. It is a principal city of the Deltona–Daytona Beach–Ormond Beach metropolitan area, which was home to an estimated 685,344 people in 2021. It is the second largest city in the Greater Orlando combined statistical area.

The city, previously known as Deltona Lakes, was originally established as a planned residential community, and was master-planned and developed by the General Development Corporation and the Mackle Brothers. Since its opening in 1962, the community rapidly grew from a small subdivision to becoming one of largest cities in Central Florida by the end of the 20th century, largely in part by the Mackle Brothers&#x27; worldwide marketing efforts showcasing small low maintenance homes offered at affordable prices. The city is mostly residential, and primarily serves as a commuter town for the nearby cities of Orlando and Daytona Beach, as well as its surrounding communities.

== History ==
The area of current Deltona and surrounding communities was originally inhabited by nomadic Timucuans, who found fish and fresh water to be plentiful in the area. After Florida became a state in 1845, steamboats began to make regular trips up the St. Johns River to Lake Monroe. George Sauls, a former secret agent for the Confederacy during the American Civil War, along with his wife Adeline and six children, were the first settlers in the area in 1859. The area was located approximately north of the community of Osteen. Sauls&#x27; homestead caught fire in 1972, but it would eventually be designated as a historical site by the Volusia County Historical Commission, and the street, originally named Barranca, was renamed George Sauls Street in 1977. It was decommissioned as a historical site in 2000, and its site marker has since been relocated to the nearby Osteen Cemetery, with maintenance overseen by the Volusia County Preservation Board.

What now constitutes the city was originally developed in 1962 as Deltona Lakes by Elliott, Robert and Frank Mackle as a planned residential community through the purchase of 17,203 acres of land. The development would open to potential land buyers on November 18, 1962, and included out-parcels for drainage retention, apartments, churches, parks, commercial centers, an industrial area, a community center, and a golf course. Deltona Lakes was heavily marketed throughout the United States, including Ohio, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. Sales representatives would also market in places such as Germany, Puerto Rico, Latin America and the Far East.

By November 1965, just one year after its opening, Deltona Lakes grew to a population of nearly 1,600, nearly 1,000 homes were built or under construction, and had more than 120 miles of paved roads or roads being surfaced. By September 1966, Deltona Lakes came to attract more families, growing to a population of 2,413, and a student enrollment of more than 200, resulting in soaring property sales of up to US$60 million. In April 1967, more than 30 civic, social, charitable and fraternal clubs would form, including a civic association, a men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf association, a shuffle board club, and a bicycle club. By 1970, Deltona Lakes had an estimated population of 4,868 and would continue to grow in population throughout the 1970s and 1980s, reaching a population of 51,828 by 1990.

The residents of Deltona Lakes attempted to incorporate it as a city in 1987 and 1990, but were not successful until 1995. A city charter was adopted on September 9, 1995, and a seven-member city commission was elected. Deltona Lakes was incorporated as a city on December 31, 1995, with its name shortened to Deltona.

By 2000, the city grew to a population of 69,543 people, surpassing Daytona Beach as the most populous city in Volusia County. After the city&#x27;s incorporation, regular city meetings would be held on the second floor of the now-defunct SouthTrust Bank building on Deltona Boulevard, until the first city hall began construction in 2001. The US$7 million project would complete for opening on March 16, 2002. On December 3, 2002, ground broke for the development of the Deltona satellite campus of Daytona State College (then known as Daytona Beach Community College), adjacent to Deltona City Hall. The campus opened in August 2004.

On August 6, 2004, four men broke into a home and beat six people and a dog to death with baseball bats, making it the deadliest mass murder in Volusia County history.

In recent years, new measures have been taken by city officials to begin attracting new businesses and industries into the city. Specially zoned areas in the city have been designated to allow for the development of upscale office facilities, light industrial space, health care facilities, warehousing and distribution facilities, commercial recreational facilities, and lodging services.

Deltona operates under a commission–manager form of government, consisting of seven elected officials, and an appointed city manager. Residents elect, through non-partisan elections, a mayor who represents the city at-large and six commission members who each represent a specific district of the community. Elected officials serve four-year terms, with a limit of two successive four-year terms. The mayor serves as the presiding officer at official meetings and as the ceremonial head of the city. A vice mayor is elected annually by the city commission from among the commission members. The current mayor is Santiago Avila Jr, who was elected into office in November 2022.

No invocation is normally recited at the start of City Commission meetings. However, in June, 2017, the national group Americans United for Separation of Church and State, acting on behalf of a Deltona resident, contacted the city&#x27;s attorneys to advise them that the reading of passages from the Bible by City Commissioner Christopher Alcantara allegedly violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. The city responded that “engaging in the recitation of Biblical verse during a public meeting is not in and of itself enough for an Establishment Clause violation.”

<doc id="109832" wikidata="Q375375" url="?curid=109832" title="New Smyrna Beach, Florida">
<text>New Smyrna Beach is a city in Volusia County, Florida, United States, located on the central east coast of the state, with the Atlantic Ocean to the east. The downtown section of the city is located on the west side of the Indian River and the Indian River Lagoon system. The Coronado Beach Bridge crosses the Intracoastal Waterway just south of Ponce de Leon Inlet, connecting the mainland with the beach on the coastal barrier island. The population was 30,142 at the 2020 census; according to 2023 census estimates, the city is estimated to have a population of 32,655.

The surrounding area offers many opportunities for outdoor recreation; these include fishing, sailing, motorboating, golfing, and hiking. Visitors participate in water sports of all kinds, including swimming, scuba diving, kitesurfing, and surfing. In July 2009, New Smyrna Beach was ranked number nine on the list of &quot;best surf towns&quot; in &quot;Surfer.&quot; It was recognized as &quot;one of the world&#x27;s top 20 surf towns&quot; by &quot;National Geographic&quot; in 2012. It has also been dubbed &quot;The Shark Bite Capital of the World.&quot;

New Smyrna Beach&#x27;s motto is &quot;cygnus inter anates&quot;, which is Latin for &quot;a swan among ducks.&quot; The city is located in the so-called &quot;Fun Coast&quot; region of the state of Florida, a regional term created by the Daytona Beach/Halifax area Chamber of Commerce. This coincides with the local area code 386, which spells FUN on touchtone phones. 

==History==

The area was first settled by Europeans in 1768, when Scottish physician Dr. Andrew Turnbull, a friend of James Grant, the governor of British East Florida, established the colony of New Smyrna. Dr. Turnbull had married Gracia Dura Bin (some sources give her name as Maria Gracia Rubini), the daughter of a Greek London merchant from the Ottoman city of Smyrna (modern-day İzmir in Turkey) and named the settlement in honor of his wife&#x27;s birthplace, and the homeland of some of those in his future labor force who were Greek from the Mani peninsula. No one had previously attempted to settle so many people at one time in a town in North America.

Turnbull recruited about 1,300 settlers, intending for them to grow hemp, sugarcane, and indigo, as well as to produce rum, at his plantation on the northeastern Atlantic coast of Florida. The majority of the colonists came from Menorca (historically called &quot;Minorca&quot; in English), one of the Mediterranean Balearic Islands of Spain, and were of Catalan culture and language.

Although the colony produced relatively large amounts of processed indigo in its first few years of operation, it eventually collapsed after suffering major losses due to insect-borne diseases and Indian raids, and growing tensions caused by mistreatment of the colonists on the part of Turnbull and his overseers. The survivors, about 600 in number, marched nearly 70 miles north on the King&#x27;s Road and relocated to St. Augustine, where their descendants live to this day. In 1783, East and West Florida were returned to the Spanish, and Turnbull abandoned his colony to retire in Charleston, South Carolina.

The St. Photios Greek Orthodox National Shrine on St. George Street in St. Augustine honors the Greeks among the settlers of New Smyrna; they were the first Greek Orthodox followers in North America. The historical exhibit adjoining the chapel tells the story of their plight, with accompanying exhibits, and of their contributions to the city.

Central Florida remained sparsely populated by white settlers well into the 19th century, and it was frequently raided by Seminole Indians trying to protect their territory. United States troops fought against them in the Seminole Wars, but they were never completely dislodged. 

During the Civil War, on March 23, 1862, portions of the 3rd Florida Infantry Regiment defeated a small U.S. naval force that was attempting to land near New Smyrna. Later on, in 1863, the &quot;Stone Wharf&quot; was shelled by Union gunboats.

In 1887, when New Smyrna was incorporated, it had a population of 150. In 1892, Henry Flagler provided service to the town via his Florida East Coast Railway. This led to a rapid increase in the area&#x27;s population. Its economy grew as tourism was added to its citrus and commercial fishing industries.

During Prohibition in the 1920s, the city and its river islands were popular sites for moonshine stills and hideouts for rum runners, who came from the Bahamas through Mosquito Inlet, now Ponce de León Inlet. &quot;New Smyrna&quot; became &quot;New Smyrna Beach&quot; in 1947, when the city annexed the seaside community of Coronado Beach. Today, it is a resort town of over 20,000 permanent residents.

Like St. Augustine, established by the Spanish, New Smyrna has been under the rule of four &quot;flags&quot;: the British, Spanish, United States (from 1821, with ratification of the Adams–Onís Treaty), and the Confederate Jack. After the end of the Civil War in 1865, it returned with Florida to the United States.

==Geography==
The coordinates for the City of New Smyrna Beach is located at . According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and of it (9.09%) is covered by water. It is bordered by the city of Port Orange to the northwest, unincorporated Volusia County to the north, the census-designated place of Samsula-Spruce Creek to the west, and the cities of Edgewater and Bethune Beach and the Canaveral National Seashore to the south. Bounded on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, New Smyrna Beach is on the Indian River. The city is connected to other parts of the state by Interstate 95, U.S. Route 1, and State Road 44.

==Climate==

Like the rest of Florida north of Lake Okeechobee, New Smyrna Beach has a humid subtropical (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) climate characterized by hot, humid summers and warm, mostly dry winters. The rainy season lasts from May until October, and the dry season, from November to April. New Smyrna averages only about two freezes per year, and many species of subtropical plants and palms are grown in the area. The city has recorded snowfall only three times in its 250-year history. The summers are long and hot, with frequent severe thunderstorms in the afternoon, as central Florida is the lightning capital of North America. Winters are pleasant with frequent sunny skies and dry weather.

Weather hazards include hurricanes from June until November, though direct hits are rare. Hurricane Charley exited over New Smyrna Beach on August 13, 2004, after crossing the state in a northeastern direction from its initial landfall in Punta Gorda. The storm caused extensive damage to the beachside portion of the city and toppled many historic oak trees in the downtown area and along historic Flagler Avenue. New Smyrna was hit by Hurricane Ian in 2022, leading to flood damage for more than a thousand residents and one fatality, and by Hurricane Milton in 2024, causing power outages for almost 90% of local customers and further flooding in the local area.

Named one of &quot;America&#x27;s Top Small Cities for the Arts&quot;, New Smyrna Beach is home to the Atlantic Center for the Arts, an artists-in-residence community and educational facility, the Harris House, the Little Theatre, and a gallery of fine arts, Arts on Douglas.

Popular amongst tourists, roosters roam the main street of the city, Flagler Avenue. They are thought to be a result of abandonment by locals (as only hens are permitted for personal use).

The New Smyrna Speedway is a half-mile paved racetrack opened in 1967 that currently hosts the ARCA Menards Series East, NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour, Southern Super Series and World Series of Asphalt Stock Car Racing.

==Shark attacks==
According to the &quot;International Shark Attack File&quot; maintained by the University of Florida, in 2007, Volusia County had more confirmed shark bites than any other region in the world. Experts from the university have referred to the county as having the &quot;dubious distinction as the world&#x27;s shark-bite capital&quot;. The trend continued in 2008, when the town broke its own record, with 24 shark bites. An &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; photographer shot a picture of a four-foot spinner shark jumping over a surfer, a reversal of &quot;jumping the shark&quot;.
Sharks bit three different surfers on September 18, 2016, in the span of a few hours at the same beach. Very few of the shark bites are fatal. In July 2024, two men and a 14-year-old boy were bitten in three separate attacks in less than one week.

<text>Oak Hill is a city in Volusia County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Deltona–Daytona Beach–Ormond Beach, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,986 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The first inhabitants of what would become Oak Hill were the native Timucuan, who lived along the shore from c. 2000 BCE to 1500 CE, when European settlers started to arrive. In 1564, the French illustrator, Jacques LeMoyne, made a map showing an Indian village named Surruque el Viejo near el Baradero de Suroc. The name &quot;Oak Hill&quot; seems to have been first used by seasonal northern loggers c. 1850.

Florida became a state in 1845, and British and American settlers started to arrive. They began to displace the various tribes, including the Seminoles, who fought back. One Seminole War raid in 1856 resulted in four deaths. A resident, Arad Shelton, took their bodies north to New Smyrna Beach by wagon. Permanent, uninterrupted settlement of non-indigenous people occurred between 1857 through 1874.

By the Civil War, Oak Hill had a salt works, some part-time stores, and the first orange groves had been planted (by a Mr. Mitchell). Oak Hill also has Civil War veterans buried in the local cemetery: five who fought for the Union, and six who fought for the Confederacy.

Hotels, stores, a post office, and a school operated by Rev. Wicks in the Congregational church served a few white students in the morning and several black students in the afternoon. A public school for white students was constructed in the early 1890s, and a prominent black freedman, Bill Williams, provided instruction and space for black students in 1901. A public school for black students was constructed in 1927.

In 1924, a grade 1 through 10 school was built on Ridge Road, just to the east of Dixie Highway (now US-1), which was paved the same year. This building was replaced in 1960 by a new structure, which eventually became the W.F. Burns Elementary School. In 2008, the county school board closed the school (citing budget cuts) and slated it for demolition. County work crews stripped the facility of anything of value.

The municipality was officially incorporated as the Town of Oak Hill in 1925 and reincorporated as the City of Oak Hill in 1927.

The non-profit Oak Hill Community Trust, with the assistance and guidance of local architect Sid Corhern, Tom Gibbs, and many, many other concerned citizens purchased the property from the county school board in late 2009. A charter school operator was contacted and after voluminous paperwork, was approved in January 2011.

Beginning in September 2010, hundreds of volunteers gave thousands of hours of their time to refurbish the buildings. They did plumbing, electrical, painting, landscaping and much more, often with donated materials. The school opened in August 2011, with 260 students enrolled.

In 2012, Kennedy Space Center donated a surplus 10,000 square foot office building to the school, on condition that it had to be moved from KSC without delay. Again, volunteers stepped forward and the building was delivered (in eight sections) to the site, reassembled, refurbished as classrooms, and is now in use.

The school is a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) school, and after only a few years of operation, has already achieved a &quot;A&quot; rating. As of 2024, there are 1,100 students in grades K through 12. Many are local, and some come from as far away as Ormond Beach and Orange City.

In the past, citrus growing and commercial fishing were the primary income sources for residents of Oak Hill. A series of hard freezes, cold snaps and the advent of citrus canker have greatly reduced the number of citrus groves, and by 1995 the State of Florida&#x27;s Gill Net Ban eliminated most of the fishing business. There are several fish, clam and oyster farms in operation.

There is a significant amount of recreational fishing and eco-tourism, and Oak Hill is one terminus for the Florida &quot;River of Lakes&quot; scenic highway. Several regional bicycle paths traverse Oak Hill, and seeing groups of dozens of recreational touring cyclists is quite common. East of the town&#x27;s center, on the edge of Mosquito Lagoon is Seminole Rest National Historic Site, part of Canaveral National Seashore.

City government is &quot;business friendly&quot; with a very low paperwork burden for businesses and minimal license fees. Additionally, business owners over the age of 65 get or renew their city licenses for free.

The City of Oak Hill was first chartered in 1927. Local government was based on a Mayor-Commission, with each commissioner functioning as head of a municipal department. The city was disbanded in 1930. The country was in a depression, and the city petitioned the government to inactivate the charter, which was granted. The city later petitioned the government in 1962 to reactivate the charter.

Clarence Goodrich was the city&#x27;s mayor from 1963 to 1989, the longest term any mayor has held in the state of Florida. Bobby Greatrex was mayor from 1989 to 1990, and Bruce Burch served from 1990 to 1994. Toreatha Wood became the city&#x27;s first female mayor, as well as first African-American female mayor, serving from 1999 to 2000. Darry Evans was the first African American male mayor. Lorna Travis was mayor from 2000 to 2001, Susan Cook was mayor from 2001 to 2002, and Bob Jackson was mayor in 2002. Mayor Darla Lauer resigned for personal reasons, and was replaced by Mary Lee Cook. The current mayor is Douglas Gibson, who was elected in November 2012.

On the evening of August 1, 2011, the city commission voted to disband the city&#x27;s police department due to ongoing acrimony, personality conflicts and policy disagreements between the city commissioners and the police department. All nine employees received unemployment benefits. The Volusia County Sheriff&#x27;s Department assumed law enforcement duties for the city.

Oak Hill is on the verge of major growth. As of late 2024, five residential planned unit developments (RPUDs) are in various stages of the permitting process. These will add about 1,400 homes to Oak Hill, easily doubling the population in five years or so as the homes get built. The city has passed (October 2024) a one year moratorium on new RPUD applications, not to discourage growth, but in order to give the city time to hire and train new staff to process the anticipated inspections, paperwork, etc.

One of the developments incorporates two Historic Black Cemeteries, &quot;Saints and Sinners&quot;. The developer and the attorneys deeded the cemetery locations to a 501c3 foundation, and pledged funds (from the HOA dues) for the ongoing maintenance of the cemeteries. There was tremendous community support and involvement for the cleanup and brush removal at these previously neglected sites.

<text>Ormond Beach is a city in Volusia County, Florida, United States. The population was 43,080 at the 2020 census. Ormond Beach lies directly north of Daytona Beach and is a principal city of the Deltona–Daytona Beach–Ormond Beach, FL Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city is known as the birthplace of speed, as early adopters of motorized cars flocked to its hard-packed beaches for yearlong entertainment, since paved roads were not yet commonplace. Ormond Beach lies in Central Eastern Florida.

==History==

The Timucuan town of Nocoroco was located where the Tomoka River joins the Halifax River, just north of present-day Ormond Beach, when Álvaro Mexía passed through it in 1605 on a mission to establish relations between Spanish Florida and the Surruque and Ais peoples of the coast of what are now Volusia and Brevard counties. Little is known of what happened to inhabitants of the area after Mexía&#x27;s visit.

The city is named for James Ormond I, an Anglo-Irish-Scottish sea captain commissioned by King Ferdinand VII of Spain to bring Franciscan settlers to this part of Florida. Ormond had served Britain and Spain in the Napoleonic Wars as a ship captain, and was rewarded for his services to Spain by King Ferdinand VII. Ormond later worked for the Scottish Indian trade company of Panton, Leslie &amp; Company, and his armed brig was called the &quot;Somerset&quot;. After returning to Spanish control, in 1821, Florida was acquired from Spain by the United States, but hostilities during the Second Seminole War delayed settlement until after 1842. In 1875, the community was founded as New Britain by inhabitants from New Britain, Connecticut, but would be incorporated on April 22, 1880, as the Town of Ormond for its early plantation owner.

With its hard, white beach, Ormond became popular for the wealthy seeking relief from northern winters during the Floridian boom in tourism following the Civil War. The St. Johns and Halifax Railway arrived in 1886, and the first bridge across the Halifax River was built in 1887. John Anderson and James Downing Price opened the Ormond Hotel on January 1, 1888. Henry Flagler bought the hotel in 1890 and expanded it to accommodate 600 guests. It would be one in a series of Gilded Age hotels catering to passengers aboard his Florida East Coast Railway, which had purchased the St. Johns &amp; Halifax Railroad. Once a well-known landmark which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, the hotel was razed in 1992.

On December 5, 1896, the Nathan F. Cobb, a wooden schooner built in 1890, ran aground on a sandbar off Ormond.

One of Flagler&#x27;s guests at the Ormond Hotel was his former business partner at the Standard Oil Company, John D. Rockefeller. He arrived in 1914 and after four seasons at the hotel bought an estate called The Casements, that would be Rockefeller&#x27;s winter home during the latter part of his life. Sold by his heirs in 1939, it was purchased by the city in 1973 and now serves as a cultural center. It is the community&#x27;s best-known historical structure.

Beginning in 1902, some of the first automobile races were held on the compacted sand from Ormond south to Daytona Beach. Pioneers in the industry, including Ransom Olds with his Pirate Racer, and Alexander Winton, tested their inventions. The American Automobile Association brought timing equipment in 1903 and the area acquired the nickname the &quot;Birthplace of Speed.&quot; In 1907, Glenn Curtiss set an unofficial world record of , on a 269 cu in (4,410 cc) Curtiss V-8 motorcycle. Lee Bible, in the record-breaking, but fatal, White Triplex, was less fortunate. Driving on the beach is still permitted on some stretches.

The municipality was officially renamed as the City of Ormond Beach following a referendum held on April 25, 1950.

Ormond Beach has four downtown riverfront parks and a beachfront park along with 37 other parks and gardens large and small. The historic shopping district located along Granada Boulevard from A1A to Orchard Street is home to dozens of locally owned shops and restaurants along with historic and cultural sites.

==History and local landmarks==
The earliest known inhabitants of the Ormond-by-the-Sea area were the Timucuan Indians, who in the sixteenth century occupied a large village called Nocoroco, located at the site of Tomoka State Park. The Timucuan diet relied heavily on oysters and other shellfish, and their shell middens, or trash heaps, may still be found near the Halifax River in Ormond-by-the-Sea.

Among the first Anglo settlers of the area was Chauncey A. Bacon, an architect and Civil War veteran from New Britain, Connecticut, who in 1876 purchased in present-day Ormond-by-the-Sea and named it the Number Nine Plantation. In her book Ormond-On-The-Halifax, Alice Strickland describes the site: &quot;The land was covered with a dense, tangled forest of palmettos, scrub oaks, and pine trees which Bacon cleared out with axe and grub hoe. The Bacon&#x27;s first home was a palmetto cabin, but later Bacon built a small, two story house with a large coquina rock fireplace on top of the Indian shell mound.&quot;

The Bacons later constructed a larger home, which still stands on John Anderson Drive, from salvaged mahogany logs that washed ashore from the City of Vera Cruz shipwreck. The property was also planted with a large fruit grove featuring oranges, grapefruit, lemons, loquats and guavas, among others. By the turn of the century, the Bacons had a thriving home business selling brandied figs and their best-selling &quot;Number 9 Guava Jelly.&quot;

In 1909, the Bacons sold Number Nine Plantation to M.C. Hillery who operated it for a few years and then sold it in 1911 to a company that had been organized by Ferdinand Nordman Jr. Nordman constructed a &quot;jelly house&quot; and enlarged the fruit business, selling fruit preserves via mail order to customers across the country, including New York Governor, Nelson Rockefeller. The business survived until 1968, and the jelly house was demolished to make way for a subdivision in 1984.

Another early settler was Leonard B. Knox, who developed a citrus plantation known as Mound Grove, located along High Bridge Road near its crossing with Bulow Creek. It was Knox&#x27;s son Donald who planted the Canary Island date palms which currently line the road. Part of the property also included a waterside building that operated as Uncle Guy&#x27;s Fish Camp between the 1930s and 1950s. The property was subsequently acquired by Dick Cobb, who operated a bar and restaurant out of the building, which became known as &quot;Cobb&#x27;s Corner.&quot; The business closed in the 1970s, although portions of the structure remain.

Despite these early settlements, nearly all of present-day Ormond-by-the-Sea remained undeveloped until the 1950s, when the area began to develop in earnest as a retirement community. The &quot;by the sea&quot; appellation was used to distinguish the area from the adjacent city of Ormond Beach, located immediately to the south. Though unincorporated, it was first represented by the North Peninsula Zoning Commission, created in 1955.

For many years, one of Ormond-by-the-Sea&#x27;s most distinguishing landmarks was the Ormond Pier, a steel structure constructed in 1959 near the intersection of Laurie Drive and A1A. A large section of the Ormond Pier was torn away by a storm in November 1984, and the remaining portions subsequently demolished for safety reasons in the early 1990s.

Approximately one mile north on A1A, near the intersection of A1A and Spanish Waters Drive, stands a watch tower constructed in 1942 by the Coast Guard Reserve to look out for German U-boats operating off the coast. The tower was restored in 2004 and is one of the last remaining examples of a World War II era observation tower on the Florida coast.

At the northern end of Ormond-by-the-Sea is the North Peninsula State Park, comprising approximately of undeveloped coastal dunes and marsh lands, which were acquired in the mid-1980s through the Conservation &amp; Recreation Lands Program, later known as the &quot;Preservation 2000&quot; and &quot;Florida Forever&quot; programs. Among other species, the park provides crucial habitat for the Florida scrub jay, a threatened federal species of which less than 4,000 breeding pairs are thought to survive.

==Ecology==
Though most of Ormond-by-the-Sea is little more than a half-mile wide, it supports no fewer than six distinct ecological zones. The beach, or tidal zone, features distinctive reddish-colored sand created by crushed coquina shells. Here may be found sand fleas and ghost crabs, as well as a variety of coastal birds including plovers, stilts, avocets, terns, and gulls. Just above the tide line, several species of sea turtles are known to lay their eggs, including the leatherback, Atlantic loggerhead, and green turtle.

Immediately inland is the Temperate Beach Dune, a &quot;pioneer zone&quot; of vegetation growing along the primary dunes. Species of note include sea oats, beach morning glory, and beach sunflower.

Slightly inland from the primary dunes is the Coastal Strand, a shrubby area dominated by saw palmetto, Spanish bayonet, prickly pear cactus, and greenbrier vines. The Coastal Strand frequently overlaps with nearby sand ridges featuring Florida scrub plant communities, including scrub live oaks, slash pine, and Florida&#x27;s state tree, the sabal palm (often called a &quot;cabbage palm&quot;). Species of note include the Florida scrub jay and the endangered gopher tortoise.

Close to the Halifax River, the soil is more moist and supports Maritime Hammock species, including live oaks, magnolias, American holly, red cedars and coontie ferns. In many areas, Brazilian pepper trees, an invasive exotic species, may also be seen growing.

The river&#x27;s edge features many plants associated with tidal marshes, including salt marsh cordgrass, needle rush and mangroves. Oysters and blue crabs are common in the shallow waters, as are a variety of wading birds including egrets and herons.

<text>South Daytona is a city in Volusia County, Florida, United States. The population was 12,865 at the 2020 census.
==History==

South Daytona was once a town called Blake (named after wealthy Boston businessman Alpheus P. Blake), with some forty resident families and as many more non-resident property holders. Many of the early settlers profitably engaged in orange culture and vegetable gardening. According to the National Archives in Washington, D.C., Blake opened its first post office on August 19, 1878. Then c. 1886, the first train came as far as Daytona, and ten years later the line was extended to Miami. Soon thereafter, a railroad station was built at Big Tree Crossing.

By 1926, the towns of Daytona, Daytona Beach and Seabreeze were consolidated to create the city of Daytona Beach. Daytona Beach then proceeded to annex all the adjacent territories, including the town of Blake. Because of new taxes and appraisals levied, residents of Blake were forced to hire an attorney and eventually, c. 1938, succeeded in breaking away from Daytona Beach to become the incorporated town of South Daytona.

Soon after World War II, the town created a Building Department, followed by a Planning and Zoning Board. Builders and developers soon became interested in the area, and South Daytona started to develop. South Daytona was then in a position to request financial assistance from the federal government for expansion of utilities, streets, etc. South Daytona was the second town in the Halifax area, after Daytona Beach, to install a sanitary sewer system. The town continued to prosper and was incorporated as the City of South Daytona in 1951. South Daytona has operated under a City Manager/Council form of government since 1980, with the Mayor and four council members serving four-year, staggered terms beginning in 1990.

==Geography==

South Daytona is located at (29.165310, –81.009057), on the Halifax River, just south of the city of Daytona Beach.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (26.29%) is water. There are nearly of roadway, of sewer lines, and of water lines throughout the city. The average elevation is above sea level.

<text>Sopchoppy is a city in Wakulla County, Florida, United States. The city is located on the Florida Panhandle in North Florida, with Ochlockonee River State Park located nearby. It is part of the Tallahassee, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 426 at the 2020 census, down from 457 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
The City of Sopchoppy is located at (30.059994, –84.491084).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.5 square miles (3.9 km), all land.

==Climate==
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild winters. According to the Köppen climate classification, the City of Sopchoppy has a humid subtropical climate zone (&quot;Cfa&quot;).

==History==

The city&#x27;s name is a corruption of &quot;Lockchoppe&quot;, derived from the Muskogee &quot;lokchapi&quot; (&quot;lokcha&quot; meaning &quot;acorn&quot;, and &quot;api&quot; meaning &quot;stem&quot;), which was the old name of the nearby river.

Mention of &quot;Sopchoppy&quot; can be found in 1850, in a runaway slave ad published by Henry Mash in the May 7, 1850 Florida Sentinel newspaper of Tallahassee. This is nearly 50 years earlier than the 1894 claim noted below.

Sopchoppy came into existence in 1894 after the CT&amp;G Railroad Company built a railway through the area. It platted the city on property it already owned in the area, across the river from Greenough. To encourage people to settle the area, the railroad engaged in an advertising campaign, exaggerating the quality of the soil and climate.

The Sopchoppy Depot was built in 1891. Now a museum, it was built for the Carrabelle, Tallahassee &amp; Georgia Railroad (G. F. &amp; A.), and referred to colloquially as the &quot;Gopher, Frog &amp; Alligator, Company&quot;, which was absorbed by the Georgia, Florida and Alabama Railroad. The line began in 1893 and closed in 1946. It transported lumber, turpentine and related products, honey, farm produce, soldiers, fish and oysters packed in barrels in ice as well as sturgeon caviar from the Sopchoppy River, frog legs, and catfish.

Although it has existed as a settlement since at least 1894, the City of Sopchoppy was officially incorporated as a municipality in 1955.

==Festivals==
The city is home to the annual American Worm Gruntin&#x27; Festival, a city celebration named in honor of a worm grunting—also known as worm charming—a method for driving worms to the surface of the earth. Worm charmers hammer wooden stakes into the ground, then rub them with metal slabs. The resulting vibrations cause worms to surface, whereupon they are typically gathered and used or sold for fishing bait. The festival includes a 1.4 mile “Fun Run”, a worm grunting competition, live music, craft vendors, and a ball.

Part of Tim Dorsey&#x27;s 2017 novel &quot;Clownfish Blues&quot; is set in Sopchoppy and worm grunting is a plot element.

<text>St. Marks is a city in Wakulla County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Tallahassee, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. St. Marks is located on the Florida Panhandle in North Florida, along the Gulf of Mexico. The population at the 2020 census was 274, down from 293 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
The approximate coordinates for the City of St. Marks is located at .
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and 0.52% is water.

==Climate==
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild winters. According to the Köppen climate classification, St. Marks has a humid subtropical climate zone (&quot;Cfa&quot;).

==History==
Originally known as San Marcos de Apalache and centered on a Spanish fort, this town was founded by the Spanish in the 17th century in what was then Spanish Florida. There was a trading post of Panton, Leslie &amp; Company in the late 18th century. A long time has passed since St. Marks last had appreciable importance, but this place on Apalachee Bay in Florida&#x27;s Big Bend is a very old and historic Gulf port. Fortifications built here by the Spanish in the 17th century, and rebuilt several times, provided the venue for force of arms repeatedly up through the American Civil War.

In the best-known incident, Andrew Jackson, in his incursion into Spanish Florida in 1818, executed British nationals Robert Chrystie Ambrister and Alexander George Arbuthnot at the old fort, as well as the Muscogee (&quot;Creek&quot;) religious leader called Francis the Prophet. This nearly embroiled the United States in international strife. San Marcos de Apalache Historic State Park interprets the site of the old fort.

Today&#x27;s St. Marks evidently has its roots in American commercial activity that took hold beneath the walls of the fort upon acquisition of Spanish Florida by the U.S. in 1821—before the settlement moved slightly up the St. Marks River to the present position. Various articles in publications like &quot;Florida Historical Quarterly&quot; relate how the fort site later held a government &quot;naval&quot; hospital to meet yellow fever emergencies in the merchant marine. And just afterward Confederate batteries were established on the site in the Civil War. Their earthworks remain and are interpreted in the historic state park. But the site also exhibits old Spanish stonework, and not far away (though inaccessible), just down St. Marks River are shallow Spanish quarries where this limestone was evidently obtained in the 1730s.

Limestone quarried here by the Spanish helped to make the St. Marks Light lighthouse, constructed about 1830 by the U.S. government. The lighthouse stands, after a couple of reconstructions, at the mouth of the river six miles from town and accessible by road. The lighthouse is, like San Marcos de Apalache, on the National Register of Historic Places.

St. Marks was a seaport for all of Middle Florida and lower Georgia during this early period. Ellen Call Long, on her way to Tallahassee, described the port about 1830 as &quot;a quaint little village, amphibious-like, consisting of a few dwelling houses, stores, etc., mostly built on stilts or piles, as if ready to launch when wind or tide prevailed.&quot;

A railroad often cited as Florida&#x27;s first connected the port of St. Marks with the territorial capital, Tallahassee, some 20 miles inland. The line, the Tallahassee Railroad, was constructed about 1836, and until the Civil War it served in the export of Middle Florida&#x27;s cotton through St. Marks.

The capacity of the St. Marks port was limited, and it was surpassed in the 19th century by the larger port of Apalachicola, served by the Thomasville, Tallahassee and Gulf Railroad via Carrabelle, Florida.

The City of St. Marks was officially incorporated as a municipality in 1963.

The now-abandoned rail line serves as Tallahassee-St. Marks Historic Railroad State Trail, a paved bicycle and equestrian trail terminating at the St. Marks waterfront.

On July 10, 2005, the section of the coast was damaged by the big storm surge associated with Hurricane Dennis, severely flooded the town, causing major damage to local businesses and homes. As on other occasions in its history, St. Marks was flooded badly with saltwater.

==Demographics==
St. Marks first appeared in the 1850 U.S. census with a total population of 189.

<text>DeFuniak Springs ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Walton County, Florida, United States. The population was 5,919 as of the 2020 Census, up from 5,177 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Crestview—Fort Walton Beach—Destin, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

DeFuniak Springs is home to Lake DeFuniak, one of two spring-fed lakes in the world that is nearly perfectly round.

DeFuniak Springs serves as a hub for residents in surrounding rural and unincorporated communities. Areas such as Paxton, Mossy Head, Ponce de Leon, and others in between utilize the services of DeFuniak Springs.

==History==
=== Founding ===
The town was founded during the late 19th century as a resort development by the officers of the Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad, a subsidiary of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. The P&amp;A was organized to connect the terminus of the L&amp;N at Pensacola to the western terminus of a predecessor of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad at River Junction—now Chattahoochee—in the 1880s. The town was named after Frederick R. DeFuniak, a vice-president of the L&amp;N. Like much of Northwest Florida, DeFuniak Springs was settled mainly by Scots from Virginia and the Carolinas.

=== Chautauqua ===
DeFuniak Springs was established as a final-destination resort. The developers enlisted the cooperation and aid of the Chautauqua Movement. The Chautauqua Hall of Brotherhood, an auditorium seating 4,000, was constructed on Lake DeFuniak in the center of town. Seminars, classes, and the like were held in the Hall of Brotherhood building for people on vacation.

The auditorium of the building was severely damaged by Hurricane Eloise in 1975 and razed. In 2003, the Chautauqua Hall of Brotherhood Foundation, Inc., a charitable foundation, started a capital campaign to restore the historic building. The westerly portion of the building facing Circle Drive was still in use at that time.

=== Education ===
As part of the intellectual atmosphere of the town, a college and a private high school (named Palmer College and Palmer Academy, respectively), as well as a technical school (Thomas Industrial Institute) and a teacher training school (Florida Normal College) were established in the late 19th century. Florida Normal College was later incorporated into Florida State University. The other schools closed during the Great Depression, which created financial strains. There remains a College Avenue that once led to Palmer College.

In 1886, the town held an important meeting that changed the course of public education in Florida. At this meeting, teachers from around the state formed the Florida Education Association. This teachers&#x27; union remains the state&#x27;s predominant voice for educators and is affiliated with the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers.

=== Farming ===
A chicken processing plant operated by Perdue Farms at DeFuniak Springs was closed in April 2004.

==Geography==
The city is located in the Florida Panhandle along Interstate 10 and U.S. Routes 90 and 331. I-10 runs south of the city from west to east, providing access from exit 85 (U.S. Route 331). I-10 leads east to Tallahassee, the state capital, and west to Pensacola. U.S. Route 90 runs through the city from west to east as Nelson Avenue, and leads east to Ponce de Leon and west to Crestview. U.S. Route 331 is the main north–south route in the city and its main connection to the Gulf coast. U.S. 331 leads northwest to Florala, Alabama, and south to U.S. Route 98 near Santa Rosa Beach. Florida State Road 83 also runs through the city as well, leading south to Santa Rosa Beach (with U.S. 331) and north to the Florida-Alabama state line.

===Library===
At the time of planning, the founders of DeFuniak Springs were interested in the adult education movement. For DeFuniak Springs, this movement did not only include the Chautauqua center, McCormick University and Academy, and the State Normal School, but also a community library.

In 1887, a group of women formed the Ladies Library Association, and their goal was to establish a library that would become the &quot;little sister&quot; to the Chautauqua center, university, and school. The Ladies Library Association chose a plot of land adjacent to the Chautauqua center and signed a lease for ninety-nine years. By the end of 1887, five years after the initial plan of the village, there was a community library; the Ladies Library Association&#x27;s main goal of establishing a social library was complete. Initially, the library relied on book donations, but also purchased books from the Ladies Reading Club and a private book owner, J. L. Shearer. The Ladies Library Association persisted and was able to maintain the library, books, and maintenance of the library for quite some time. However, by 1923, the Ladies Library Association was unable to continue to sustain the library and requested city funds, which the city took on gradually. It was not until the 1960s when the subscription fees were finally eliminated, and the county and city assumed total responsibility for its maintenance and collection development. Today, the Walton-DeFuniak Library contains antiquities, a medieval weapon collection, and many first-edition books.

==History==
During July 1994, the Choctawhatchee River flooded and rose to a record level of 29 feet. The flooding submerged most of Caryville under water. Due to the &#x27;buyout&#x27; of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), many residents left. This departure left only about 200 residents in the town.
Caryville, in northwestern Washington County, owes its existence largely to the forestry products industries. An early sawmill town, Caryville&#x27;s location was dictated by the presence of the Choctawhatchee River, which was crossed in Caryville by the Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad in 1882 (Later to become L&amp;N Railroad).

The most accepted matter of Caryville&#x27;s name, and the one listed in Allen Morris, The Florida Handbook, is that the name came from R.M. Cary, who was secretary to the P. and A. Railroad Company. The area was originally called Half Moon Bluff. Some of the construction material for the new railroad was unloaded from steamships coming in from Pensacola at this location.

The railroad had hardly got started before some land sales were recorded in the vicinity. On February 24, 1882, Thomas Hannah of Point Washington sold several lots totaling 121 acres of Half Moon Bluff to Edwards, Brooks and Company of Opelika, Alabama. Two years later, after the place had been named Caryville, W. L. Whitlick of Pensacola was operating what may have been the first sawmill in the community.

Some logging operation may have been in progress before the coming of the railroad. The logs were consigned to the river, bearing the name and brand of Strickland and Wesley of Point Washington. The brand was a circle saw bearing 12 teeth. The logs were floated down stream to the mouth of the Choctawhatchee where they were caught up in a boom and towed to nearby sawmills.

Big scale timber operations began with the establishment of Sanford Lumber Company at Caryville well before the end of the 19th century. By 1903 that lumber company was furnishing employment for about 400 &quot;hands&quot; and had capacity of 100,000 board feet of lumber per day. Electricity came to Caryville in 1903.

The holdings of Sanford Lumber Company were acquired by Henderson-Waits Lumber Company in 1912. Corporation officers were Glover G. Waits, president, Fred Henderson, vice president and Barney M Henderson, secretary- treasurer; Directors were Pox Henderson, James C. Waits and J. D. Henderson Jr.

By 1925, Henderson-Waits had acquired about 125,000 acres of land, including a large acreage, bought from Foshee Lumber Company, which had announced plans to build a sawmill at Chipley.

At the height of the milling operation, logs were hauled in by steam locomotive with train tracks laid as far south as Ebro for this purpose.

The Henderson-Waits holdings including the Caryville mill, were sold late in 1925 to Brown-Florida Lumber Company, a branch of the W.P. Brown Lumber Company. The sale price was reported to be $3 million.

Brown-Florida, after halting operations in the early 1930s, reopened on a half-capacity in 1933, employing about 300 men. A few years later, the holdings were reacquired by Henderson-Waits Lumber Company who soon suspended operations due to exhaustion of virgin timber in the area.

Caryville was first incorporated in 1913, the same year R. E. L. McCaskill&#x27;s first addition to Caryville was platted and recorded as a subdivision. G. G. Blake, the L &amp; N Station agent was the town&#x27;s first mayor and John A. Roberts was the first town marshal. H. E. Brooks was city clerk. Councilmen were Dr. L. H. Paul, W. C. Daniels, Pitt C. Miller, T. A. Gaskin and F. J. Moore. Streets in the McCaskill subdivision ran east and west with the avenues extending north and south.

Streets listed were Liberty, Jefferson, Roosevelt, Washington, Lincoln, McKinley, Wilson, Cleveland and Monroe. Avenues were named Waits and Henderson, each named for the principal owners of the big lumber company. Charles, named for Judge L. L. Charles, Superintendent of Schools of Washington County from 1888 - 1893, long time teacher, district Justice of the Peace and community leader. Owens, obviously named for a Washington family by the name. Daniels, for W.C. Daniels. Alford, for W.C., J. R. and S. A. Alford Sr, Chipley-Bonifay naval stores operators and business. Sessions, for K. P. and William A. Sessions, also naval store operators and businessmen. Lindsay, for Ben Lindsay, naval stores operator who became a. state senator for Walton and Holmes Counties.

Caryville was plagued with fires and floods in its early days. The most destructive flood came in March 1929.

Violence is also a part of Caryville&#x27;s history. On July 1, 1934, Joe Brock and his son Fred were gunned down on a Saturday afternoon in the midst of a crowd gathered at the sawmill commissary, known as the Company Store.

The town continued to survive. It had its own school for 72 years. The L&amp;N passenger train stopped in Caryville as did the Greyhound Bus. Western Union service was available, and the town had a drug store, a post office, numerous churches, two or more service stations and an automobile repair garage.

Si Locke, the town barber, became Justice of the Peace and Harley Nelson was the Constable, with a new 1937 Ford as his police cruiser. Early Hodges store and Jenkins Grocery operated by Mel and Christine McKinnon Jenkins were the main businesses.

The end of the virgin timber harvest did not terminate the forest products industry for Caryville. W. F. Harrison operated a sawmill and E. A. Hodges and Fern Arnold formed a lumber company, which later became Arnold Lumber Company. It remained the community&#x27;s largest industry as late as 1971. Howell Plywood Corporation operated a plant in Caryville for several years in the post World War II era. Operations were continued on a modest scale by the Harrison and Garner Lumber Company.

In 1954, residents of Caryville, realizing their town charter had lapsed, voted to remain unincorporated. Eleven years later, voters approved incorporation with a charter that withheld police and as valorem taxing powers.

Calvit L. Walker a retired Army officer, was elected mayor. C. C. Barlow was named city clerk members of the town council under the new charter were Franklin P. Evans, Herman Brown, Preston Anderson, Ernest Peters and Luther Whitaker, Gaston Bryan, Cleston Tadlock and Odell Parish were subsequently elected to the council.

A civic awakening was getting started in the town once again. A Wayside Park was added on the banks of the Choctawhatchee River, a totally new water system was installed and Caryville received a minimum custody vocational type prison facility at the south town limits.

Floods from the nearby river continued to take its toll on Caryville residents. A disastrous flooding in 1990, and again in 1994, caused many homes to be destroyed or badly damaged by the high water. In 1996. a massive buyout of homes in Caryville was initiated by FEMA with most of the home owners taking advantage of the offer to sell out and move to higher ground.

Today only a few houses dot the once thriving town of Caryville. City government is intact, however there are no schools or churches, and only a few businesses operate in the town.

Thus, the once booming sawmill town of Caryville has joined the other smaller municipalities of the area in slipping away into almost a total ghost town, leaving a rich heritage and history that will long live in the memory of those who remember the town&#x27;s colorful past.

<text>Vernon is a city in Washington County, Florida. The population was 732 at the 2020 census, up from 687 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Panama City—Panama City Beach, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The pioneer city was the site of a major Native American settlement before colonization. In the 1820s, Vernon started of as a colonial settlement called &quot;&quot;Roche&#x27;s Bluff&quot; after one of the earliest settler&#x27;s surname, Stephen J. Roche, who built and owned a trading post along Holmes Creek. The community was renamed &quot;Vernon&quot;&quot; in 1851. It was renamed for George Washington&#x27;s Virginia home, Mount Vernon, playing off the county&#x27;s name being Washington County. Vernon held the county seat from 1851 until 1927, when the seat was moved to Chipley.

The city sits on the Holmes Creek where, during the 1880s, the creek was used as a shipping route to Bonifay and other nearby municipalities. The creek was also used to ship gopher tortoises due to the high value their shell carried at that time. It was officially incorporated as the City of Vernon in 1926.

Vernon gained infamy in the late 1950s and early 1960s due to the improbably high percentage of residents who made insurance claims for lost limbs, leading to an investigation of whether residents of the city were intentionally dismembering themselves for the insurance money. These insurance claims from Vernon, with a population of 500 to 800, accounted for as many as 2/3 of claims nationally, but there was no way of proving that any particular amputation was deliberate. This led to Vernon being referred to as &quot;nub city&quot; during this period. In 1980, Errol Morris attempted to make a documentary about this phenomenon, but after being threatened by city residents and physically attacked by one, he changed the focus of the film, resulting in the 1981 documentary film &quot;Vernon, Florida&quot;.

==Geography==
The approximate coordinates for the City of Vernon is located at (30.621699, –85.711628).

<text>Milledgeville is a city in and the county seat of Baldwin County in the U.S. state of Georgia. It is northeast of Macon, bordered on the east by the Oconee River. The rapid current of the river here made this an attractive location to build a city. It was the capital of Georgia from 1804 to 1868, including during the American Civil War. Milledgeville was preceded as the capital city by Louisville and was succeeded by Atlanta, the current capital. Today U.S. Highway 441 connects Milledgeville to Madison, Athens, and Dublin.

As of April 1, 2020, the population of Milledgeville was 17,070, down from 17,715 at the 2010 U.S. census.

Milledgeville is along the route of the Fall Line Freeway, which links Milledgeville with Augusta, Macon, Columbus, and other Fall Line cities. They have long histories from the colonial era of Georgia.

Milledgeville is the principal city of the Milledgeville micropolitan statistical area, a micropolitan area that includes Baldwin and formerly Hancock county until 2023. It had a population of 43,799 at the 2020 census. The Old State Capitol is located here; it was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Much of the original city is contained within the boundaries of the Milledgeville Historic District, which was also added to the NRHP.

== History ==

Milledgeville, named after Georgia governor John Milledge (1802–1806), was founded by European Americans at the start of the 19th century as the new centrally located capital of the state of Georgia. It served as the state capital from 1804 to 1868.

In 1803 an act of the Georgia legislature called for the establishment and survey of a town to be named in honor of the current governor, John Milledge. The Treaty of Fort Wilkinson (June 1802) had recently forced Native American tribes to cede territory immediately west of the Oconee River. The white population of Georgia continued to press west and south in search of new farmland. The town of Milledgeville was developed in an area that had long been occupied by indigenous peoples.

In December 1804 the state legislature declared Milledgeville the new capital of Georgia. The new planned town, modeled after Savannah and Washington, D.C., stood on the edge of the frontier at the Atlantic fall line, where the Upper Coastal Plain meets the foothills and plateau of the Piedmont. The area was surveyed, and a town plat of was divided into 84 squares. The survey also included four public squares of each.

=== Life in the antebellum capital ===

After 1815 Milledgeville became increasingly prosperous and more respectable. Wealth and power gravitated toward the capital. Much of the surrounding countryside was developed by slave labor for cotton plantations, which was the major commodity crop of the South. Cotton bales regularly were set up to line the roads, waiting to be shipped downriver to Darien.

Public-spirited citizens such as Mayor Tomlinson Fort (1847–1848) promoted better newspapers, learning academies, and banks. In October 1842 Central State Hospital) was built here. Oglethorpe University, where the poet Sidney Lanier was later educated, opened its doors in 1838. (The college, forced to close in 1862 during the war, was rechartered in Atlanta in 1913)

The cotton boom in this upland area significantly increased the demand for slave labor. The town market, where slave auctions took place, was located on Capital Square, next to the Presbyterian church. Skilled black carpenters, masons, and laborers were forced to construct most of the handsome antebellum structures in Milledgeville.

Two events epitomized Milledgeville&#x27;s status as the political and social center of Georgia in this period:

* In March 1825 the capital was visited by American Revolutionary War hero and aristocrat, the Marquis de Lafayette. The receptions, barbecue, formal dinner, and grand ball for the veteran apostle of liberty seemed to mark Milledgeville&#x27;s coming of age. 
*The Governor&#x27;s Mansion was constructed (1839); it was one of the most important examples of Greek revival architecture in America.

By 1854 Baldwin County had a total population of 8,148, of whom 3,566 were free (mostly white), and 4,602 were African American slaves.

=== American Civil War and its aftermath ===

On January 19, 1861, Georgia convention delegates passed the Ordinance of Secession, and on February 4, 1861, the &quot;Republic of Georgia&quot; joined the Confederate States of America. In November 1864, Union General William T. Sherman and 30,000 Union troops marched into Milledgeville during his March to the Sea. Governor Joseph E. Brown had already packed up the rugs and curtains from the Governor&#x27;s Mansion, and fled town with other political and military leaders, leaving the public unprotected. Sherman largely spared the town destruction, though burned some buildings with military uses. Sherman&#x27;s troops are claimed to have poured sorghum and molasses down the pipes of the organ at St. Stephen&#x27;s Episcopal Church; the organ was replaced by New York Life Insurance Company.

In July 1868, during Reconstruction, the state legislature moved the capital to Atlanta—a city emerging as the symbol of the New South as surely as Milledgeville symbolized the Old South.

Milledgeville struggled to survive as a city after losing the business of the capital. The energetic efforts of local leaders established the Middle Georgia Military and Agricultural College (later Georgia Military College) in October 1879 on Statehouse Square. Where the crumbling remains of the old penitentiary stood, Georgia Normal and Industrial College (later Georgia College &amp; State University) was founded in November 1889. In part because of these institutions, as well as Central State Hospital, Milledgeville developed as a less provincial town than many of its neighbors.

=== Twentieth century to present ===
In 1952 the Georgia Power Company completed a dam at Furman Shoals on the Oconee River, about north of town, creating a huge reservoir called Lake Sinclair. The lake community became an increasingly important part of the town&#x27;s social and economic identity.

In the 1980s and 1990s Milledgeville began to capitalize on its heritage by revitalizing the downtown and historic district. It encouraged restoration of historic buildings and an urban design scheme on Main Street to emphasize its character.

By 2000 the population of Milledgeville and Baldwin County combined had grown to nearly 45,000. Community leaders have made concerted efforts to create a more diversified economic base, striving to wean the old capital from its dependence on government institutions such as Central State Hospital and state prisons. The state has recently closed some prisons and reduced jobs at Central State, due to tightening state budgets.

== Geography ==
Milledgeville is located at (33.087755, -83.233401) and is above sea level.

GA-22 leads northeast to Sparta and southwest to Gray. GA-24 leads east to Sandersville and north to Eatonton with U.S. 441. GA-49 leads southwest to Macon.

Milledgeville is located on the Atlantic Seaboard fall line of the United States. The Oconee River flows a half mile east of downtown on its way south to the Altamaha River and then south to the Atlantic Ocean. Lake Sinclair, a man-made lake, is about northeast of Milledgeville on the border of Baldwin, Putnam and Hancock counties.

Milledgeville is composed of two main districts: a heavily commercialized area along the highway known to locals simply as &quot;441,&quot; extending from a few blocks north of Georgia College &amp; State University to north of Milledgeville, and the &quot;Downtown&quot; area, encompassing the college, buildings housing city government agencies, various bars and restaurants. This historic area was laid out in 1803, with streets named after other counties in Georgia.

===Climate===
== Demographics ==
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 17,070 people, 5,895 households, and 2,852 families residing in the city.

City Council meetings are held on the second and fourth Tuesday of the month. Meetings are open to the public and televised locally on MBC TV-4 Milledgeville/Baldwin County Governmental/Educational Access Cable Channel on local Charter Communications.

In the November 2017 general election, incumbent Mayor Gary Thrower was defeated by Mary Parham-Copelan. She was sworn in as the city&#x27;s first African American female mayor on December 29, 2017.

<doc id="109871" wikidata="Q3261160" url="?curid=109871" title="Bethlehem, Georgia">
<text>Bethlehem is a town in Barrow County in the U.S. state of Georgia. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 715. The major employer in town is Harrison Poultry, which is the largest non-government employer in Barrow County.

The town was named after a local church, Bethlehem Methodist Church, and has a strong Christmas theme, with many of the street names being references to the nativity of Jesus, such as Mary, Joseph, and Manger. After the introduction of a 1967 stamp in Bethlehem, the town became known as a popular location for sending mail from during the holidays, as the post office sends letters marked &quot;from Bethlehem.&quot;

==History==
The land that Bethlehem and the surrounding Barrow County occupies was originally occupied by Cherokee and Creek tribes. European settlers first arrived in the area in 1786. The Bethlehem Methodist Church was established in 1796 in what would later become Bethlehem. The church opened an adjacent camp ground that was used between 1851 and 1894 which was used as a troop mobilization center during the American Civil War. The Confederate States Army&#x27;s 16th Georgia Regiment was formed at the camp ground, and the grounds were used as a refugee camp during the war. During the Reconstruction era onwards the camp ground was used for various religious services. A Christian revival meeting was taking place on August 31, 1886, when shockwaves from the 1886 Charleston earthquake were felt at an estimated MMI intensity of 6. The camp ground is now the current location of the Bethlehem Methodist Church, which was built in 1949.

The area was informally established as the community of Bethlehem in December 1883 as a stop along the Belmont – Monroe line of the Gainesville, Jefferson and Southern Railroad. The stop was named after the local Bethlehem Methodist Church. The church itself was named after the ancient town of Bethlehem, identified in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke as the birthplace of Jesus. The railway line was removed in 1946. Bethlehem was incorporated as a town in 1902 by an act of the Georgia General Assembly &quot;under the name and style of the town of Bethlehem&quot;. At the time of its incorporation it was part of Walton County, but later became part of the newly formed Barrow County in 1914, which was created using land previously belonging to the nearby Gwinnett, Jackson, and Walton counties.

In 1986 a 13-year-old Bethlehem Elementary School student made national headlines when he stabbed his principal Murray Kennedy to death with a nail file. Because the white principal was killed by a black student, the incident stoked fears of racial conflict in the community, which were addressed by local black and white leaders in the community. The case drew the attention of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference who helped contribute to the student&#x27;s defense fund. It also drew the attention of the Ku Klux Klan; 65 members of the Ku Klux Klan held a rally in front of the Winder, Georgia courthouse in protest of the murder. Despite the involvement of the KKK, fears of racial tension in the community itself quickly died out. After being charged as an adult, the student was sentenced to 15 years after pleading guilty to voluntary manslaughter.

The largest employer in the town is Harrison Poultry, which opened in Bethlehem in 1958 and is the largest non-government employer in Barrow County with around 1,000 employees.

===Holiday postal tradition===
Bethlehem&#x27;s post office is popular during the holiday season for sending cards and letters, as mail sent from there will feature Bethlehem&#x27;s cancellation mark and cachet, so that holiday mail sent will state that it is sent with &quot;Greetings from Bethlehem.&quot; This special Bethlehem cancellation mark is made with a stamping machine called a flier canceler. Bethlehem&#x27;s flier canceler is more than 100 years old and is the only one still in use by the U.S. Postal Service. The Bethlehem post office&#x27;s special cachet features the Three Wise Men and the Star of Bethlehem.

Traveling to Bethlehem to send holiday mail is a holiday tradition for visitors of the town and the Bethlehem post office sends hundreds of thousands of pieces of mail during each Christmas season. The post office also has hand-stamps that customers can use to stamp &quot;Christmas Greetings from Bethlehem&quot; on their letters and cards before being sent.

The tradition began in 1967, when the United States Postal Service debuted a special Christmas stamp at the Bethlehem post office with a ceremony that included then-governor of Georgia Lester Maddox and Assistant U.S. Postmaster General Richard J. Murphy. While it was the sixth Christmas stamp produced by the US Postal Service, it was the first Christmas stamp to be produced in the larger commemorative size, which is almost twice the size of the previous Christmas stamp. The stamp was a reproduction of Hans Memling&#x27;s &quot;Madonna and Child with Angels&quot;. Despite only regularly employing the postmaster and one other part-time employee in a town that at the time had around 350 people, this stamp was requested by so many people that the town&#x27;s postmaster hired 43 temporary workers to handle the increased workload caused by people sending in their mail to Bethlehem to be re-sent out with the Christmas stamp&#x27;s first-day-of-issue date of November 6. The Bethlehem post office ultimately sent out around 500,000 cards and letters during the 1967 Christmas season.

==Arts and culture==
The town operates a library inside City Hall as part of the Piedmont Regional Library System. Bethlehem has no designated historic districts. The nearby Kilgore Mill Covered Bridge and Mill Site (also known as Bethlehem Bridge) was built in 1874 and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, and crosses over the Apalachee River, which serves as the boundary between Barrow and Walton counties. Bethlehem hosts an annual nativity pageant during each Christmas season at the town square on Christmas Avenue, below the illuminated large star which represents the Star of Bethlehem. The original star was put in place in 1951 and measured across, and was replaced in 2009 with a star measuring due to excessive rust and nonfunctioning lights on the original.

==Parks and recreation==
The town has one designated park, the R. Harold Harrison Community Playground, which includes a playground, walking trail, and covered pavilion. The closest state park is Fort Yargo State Park, located approximately north of Bethlehem in Winder.

==Government==
When the town was incorporated in 1902 it was established that the town would operate as a civil township under a mayor and five councilmen, each with a term of one year. This government style was reaffirmed by an act passed during a 2004 session of the Georgia General Assembly, which added a town clerk to the council. 

In the United States House of Representatives, Bethlehem is part of Georgia&#x27;s 10th congressional district. For representation in the state government, the town is part of the Georgia State Senate&#x27;s 47th district, and the 116th district for the Georgia House of Representatives.

==Education==
Public education for students in Bethlehem is administrated by Barrow County Schools. Bethlehem is part of the Apalachee cluster and is served by Bethlehem Elementary School, Haymon-Morris Middle School, and Apalachee High School. High school students in Bethlehem are also able to apply to attend two college preparatory schools in Barrow County, Sims Academy of Innovation &amp; Technology or the Barrow Arts &amp; Sciences Academy. Snodon Preparatory School was located in Bethlehem until its closure in 2019, and served students from grades 9–12. Following its closure, students in Bethlehem have the option to attend a charter school in Athens known as Foothills Education Charter High School on lottery basis. Bethlehem Christian Academy is a private school located in Bethlehem that serves Pre-K through 12th grade.

==Media==

As part of the North Georgia area, Bethlehem&#x27;s primary network-affiliated television stations are WXIA-TV (NBC), WANF (CBS), WSB-TV (ABC), and WAGA-TV (Fox). WGTV is the local station of the statewide Georgia Public Television network and is a PBS member station. Bethlehem is served by the weekly newspaper &quot;Barrow News Journal&quot;, which also serves as Barrow County&#x27;s legal organ (also called a &quot;newspaper of public record&quot;). AM radio station WJBB operates their main studio out of Bethlehem.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Monroe Highway (SR 11) runs through Bethlehem in a north-to-south direction, while intersecting with SR 316 (US 29) inside the town limits, which runs from west-to-east through the town. SR 316 also intersects with SR 81 inside Bethlehem, which also runs north-to-south through the town. Many, but not all, of the street names in Bethlehem are references to the nativity of Jesus and the Bible, including such streets as Angel Street, Joseph Street, Manger Avenue, and Star Street.

The town lacks any form of public transportation and has limited sidewalks for pedestrian use. The nearest airport is the Barrow County Airport in the city of Winder, a small public use airport with two asphalt runways from Bethlehem. The closest major airports are Athens–Ben Epps Airport, which is from Bethlehem, and Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, which is away.

===Utilities===
Electricity in the town is provided by Georgia Power, while water utilities are provided by the nearby City of Winder. Unlike the rest of Barrow County which sources its water from the Bear Creek reservoir in Jackson County, Bethlehem and the City of Winder sources its water from three local sources: the Mulberry River, City Pond, and Fort Yargo Lake. Bethlehem contracts directly with a private trash hauling company to handle disposal of solid waste as a free service to residents. In 2019 the mayor of Bethlehem, Sandy McNabb, cited the lack of sewer infrastructure as &quot;the primary reason for the lack of growth in Bethlehem.&quot;

===Healthcare===
Bethlehem currently has no hospitals inside its town limits. The closest hospital is Northeast Georgia Health System Barrow, also known as NGHS Barrow, which is located in Winder north of downtown Bethlehem. Piedmont Walton is located in Monroe south of downtown Bethlehem. In May 2022 the Barrow County Planning Commission approved the construction of a new Northeast Georgia Medical Center facility in Bethlehem.

This first observance included the mailing of cards to the physicians and their wives, flowers placed on graves of deceased doctors, including Dr. Crawford Long (who in 1842 performed the first surgery under general anesthesia), and a formal dinner in the home of Dr. and Mrs. William T. Randolph. After the Barrow County Alliance adopted Mrs. Eudora Brown Almond&#x27;s resolution to pay tribute to the doctors, the plan was presented to the Georgia State Medical Alliance in 1933 by Mrs. E. R. Harris of Winder, president of the Barrow County Alliance. On May 10, 1934, the resolution was adopted at the annual state meeting in Augusta, Georgia. The resolution was introduced to the Women&#x27;s Alliance of the Southern Medical Association at its 29th annual meeting held in St. Louis, Missouri, November 19–22, 1935, by the Alliance president, Mrs. J. Bonar White. Since then, Doctors&#x27; Day has become an integral part of and synonymous with, the Southern Medical Association Alliance.

<text>Adairsville is a city in Bartow County, Georgia, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 4,878. Adairsville is approximately halfway between Atlanta and Chattanooga on Interstate 75. It is south of Calhoun, northeast of Rome and north of Atlanta.

== History ==

Adairsville used to be a small Cherokee village named after Chief Walter (John) S. Adair, a Scottish settler who married a Cherokee Indian woman before the removal of the Cherokee in 1838. It was part of the Cherokee territory along with Calhoun and including New Echota.

After the removal of the Cherokees, the village became part of Georgia, and the residents kept the name Adairsville. One of the town&#x27;s developers was William Watts, who had a railroad business interest in the town. He had brought the Western and Atlantic Railroad from Atlanta (still in use). He deeded land to the railroad and surveyed business lots including hotels, mills, and blacksmith shops around town. Watts&#x27;s plan was successful and brought the town the nickname &quot;Granary of the State&quot;; it was incorporated in 1854. He lived in Adairsville in a home built on the foundation of an Indian cabin, on a hill overlooking the town.

During the Civil War, Adairsville was involved on the side of the Confederate States of America in 1861 against the Union. On April 12, 1862, the steam locomotive &quot;The General&quot; was pursued from Atlanta and passed through Adairsville as its people the Great Locomotive Chase. After that, Adairians set a three-day street festival in remembrance of the Chase. The Civil War came to the town in full force on May 17, 1864, when the Confederate army failed to defeat Sherman and his Union army during the Atlanta Campaign in the Battle of Adairsville. After the Civil War ended in 1865, Adairsville rebuilt and became a center of the carpet and textile industries, and of farm and transportation services, including its famous railroad. Historic buildings still intact in the town include the original train depot, which was involved in the Great Locomotive Chase.

Adairsville is well known for Barnsley Gardens. Now a golf resort, Barnsley Gardens is southwest of the city center. The home was built by Sir Godfrey Barnsley of Derbyshire, England, in the late 1840s for his wife, Julia. She died before the house could be completed, but it is said that her ghost appeared to Sir Godfrey, telling him to complete the work. It was brought about by the visions of Andrew Jackson Downing, the architect who designed the grounds of the U.S. Capitol and White House. The ruins of the great main house remain. Almost lost to time and the elements, the land, including all of the ruins, was bought in 1988 by Prince Hubertus Fugger, who restored the gardens and renovated the grounds into an upscale golf resort.

On January 30, 2013, at approximately 11:30 am, the city was struck by a violent high-end EF3 tornado, leaving one dead, dozens injured, and hundreds of businesses and residences destroyed.

<text>Kingston is a village in Bartow County, Georgia, United States. The population was 722 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Kingston is located in west-central Bartow County at (34.235749, -84.944648).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Georgia State Route 293 (Kingston Highway) passes through the center of town, leading southeast to Cartersville and west to Rome. U.S. Route 411 is a four-lane highway that passes south of Kingston, connecting the same two larger communities.

==History==
Native American tribes once inhabited the area. People of the Mississippian culture were in the vicinity until about 1500 AD. Cherokee removal occurred locally by 1838. White settlers were moved in as early as 1832, after a land lottery. The city was named for John Pendleton King, a United States Senator from Georgia.

On April 12, 1862, James J. Andrews with 18 Union soldiers in disguise, and 1 civilian, having seized the locomotive &quot;The General&quot; at Big Shanty (now Kennesaw) intending to wreck the Western and Atlantic Railroad, were forced to side-track here and wait for the southbound freights to pass. After a long delay &quot;The General&quot; continued north. Pursuing from Big Shanty, William Allen Fuller (conductor) led a crew which used a push-car and other means and eventually caught the highjackers.

Confederate hospitals located here during 1862–1864. 250 Confederate and two Union soldiers died of wounds, disease and sickness. These men were wounded in the battles of Perryville, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, and in the Dalton-Kingston Campaign. The patients were moved to Atlanta in May 1864 to avoid capture by the Union, who later used the hospitals. The dead are buried in unmarked graves nearby.

===Atlanta Campaign===
Union general William T. Sherman made his headquarters in the Hargis House May 16–19, for reorganization of forces in the campaign that would end at Atlanta. Assuming Johnston&#x27;s army had moved, from Adairsville, directly on Kingston and the river crossings south, May 18, led Sherman to concentrate his forces here—only to discover that Johnston had gone directly to Cassville where, without making a stand, he continued to Allatoona on May 20. Sherman countered on May 23, by moving due south.

On May 18, 1864, Lieutenant General William J. Hardee&#x27;s corps marched from Adairsville on the road parallel to the Western and Atlantic Railroad en route to Cass Station. He turned east on this road to join General Polk&#x27;s and Hood&#x27;s Confederate corps at Cassville which had moved on the direct Adairsville - Cassville Road. Sherman erred when he assumed that all of Johnston&#x27;s army had marched from Adairsville, as Hardee had, to Kingston. This resulted in his ordering his forces concentrated here—discovering later that the Confederates were east at Cassville and not at the Etowah River south of Kingston.

On May 19 Union generals Daniel Butterfield and Joseph Hooker, the new XX Corps, were headquartered at the house of Confederate Colonel Hawkins F. Price, a state senator who had voted for Georgia secession in 1861. Hooker had been ordered from Adairsville to Kingston, on false reports that Johnston had retreated there. South of the Price house Hooker discovered that Johnston had gone to Cassville.

On May 19, 1864, the IV Corps, followed by the XIV Corps, reached Kingston at 8 a.m. The IVth turned east to Cassville. A division of the XIVth sent to Gillem&#x27;s bridge over the Etowah River found no retreating Confederates. Johnston&#x27;s forces were at Cassville, east. McPherson&#x27;s XV Corps and XVI Corps, moving south from Barnsley&#x27;s, camped on Woolley&#x27;s plantation west. The IV Corps, XX Corps and XXIII Corps were at Cassville.

May 19, 1864, McPherson&#x27;s army (XVth &amp; XVIth Corps) marched from Barnsley&#x27;s and camped on the Woolley Plantation. This right wing of Sherman&#x27;s advance, Kingston to Dallas, crossed the river, heading south, on Woolley&#x27;s Bridge over the Etowah River, May 23.

On October 11, 1864, while encamped on the Woolley Plantation, the Ohio soldiers of the XXIII Corps voted in a state election.

In 1864, a road southward from Wooley&#x27;s Bridge (Etowah River) crossed the road near this point and ran to Van Wert (Rockmart) and Dallas. This was the route of Union Major General James B. McPherson&#x27;s Army of the Tennessee (XVth and XVIth Corps), the right wing of forces under Sherman moving from Kingston to the Dallas front, May 23 and 24. At that time, the church stood at the northwestern angle of the crossroads. Another edifice was erected on the site of the present structure, eastward.

Sherman&#x27;s forces encamped until May 23, when advance across the Etowah River began.

===End of the Civil War===
The first Decoration Day, or Memorial Day, was observed in Kingston in late April 1865, and has been a continuous observance here since that day, the only such record held by any community in this nation. The first Decoration Day was observed while Union troops still occupied the town, flowers being placed on both Confederate and Union graves that day.

In 2014, Bellware and Gardiner dismissed this claim in &quot;The Genesis of the Memorial Day Holiday in America&quot;. They point out that the timing of the observance and locations of General Judah and Wofford during April 1865 make the claim untenable.

On May 12, 1865, Confederate Brigadier General William T. Wofford surrendered 3,000 to 4,000 soldiers to Union Brigadier General Henry M. Judah. These were the last significant Confederate regulars to surrender east of the Mississippi. These were mostly Georgians, not paroled in Virginia, North Carolina, and elsewhere. During final negotiations, Gen. Wofford&#x27;s headquarters were at the McCravey - Johnson residence on Church Street. General Judah&#x27;s headquarters were at Spring Bank, the home of the Rev. Charles Wallace Howard, north of Kingston. Rations were supplied to the Confederate soldiery by the Federal commissary.

<text>Fitzgerald is a city in and the county seat of Ben Hill County in the south central portion of the U.S. state of Georgia. As of 2020, its population was 9,006. It is the principal city of the Fitzgerald micropolitan statistical area, which includes all of Ben Hill and Irwin counties.

A small portion of Fitzgerald is in Irwin County.

==History==
Fitzgerald was developed in 1895 by Philander H. Fitzgerald, an Indianapolis newspaper editor. A former drummer boy in the Union Army during the Civil War, he founded it as a community for war veterans–both from the Union and from the Confederacy. The majority of the first citizens (some 2700) were Union veterans. It was incorporated on December 2, 1896. The town is located less than from the site where Confederate president Jefferson Davis was captured on May 10, 1865.

Fitzgerald was an early planned city. It was laid out as a square, with intersecting streets dividing it into four wards. Each ward was divided into four blocks and each block had sixteen squares. The first two streets running north–south on the west side of the city were named after Confederate generals Lee and Johnston, whereas the first two on the east side were named after Union generals Grant and Sherman.

After about a year, the residents planned a Thanksgiving harvest parade. Separate Union and Confederate parades were planned. But when the band struck up to play, the Confederates joined the Union veterans to march as one under the US flag. At the time there was increasing reconciliation nationwide between white soldiers of the North and South; historian David Blight notes that outstanding issues of race were pushed aside. In this era southern states had already begun to pass new constitutions that raised barriers to voter registration, following Mississippi&#x27;s in 1890, and essentially disenfranchised most freedmen and many poor whites. By 1900, Fitzgerald was a sundown town, prohibiting African Americans from living there.

In recent years the unofficial, and sometimes controversial, mascot of the city has become the red junglefowl, a wild chicken native to the Indian subcontinent. In the late 1960s, a small number were released into the woods surrounding the city and they thrive to this day. In 2019, work began on a tall topiary statue of a chicken.

==Geography==
Fitzgerald is located in Southeast Georgia at (31.715432, -83.256464). U.S. Route 129 passes through the center of the city, leading north to Abbeville, Hawkinsville, and eventually Macon, and south to Ocilla, Nashville, and Lakeland. U.S. Route 319 also passes through Fitzgerald, leading northeast to McRae and Dublin and southwest to Tifton.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.64%, is water.

==Minor league baseball teams==

Fitzgerald was home to a minor league baseball team in the Georgia State League from 1948, the league&#x27;s first season of operation, through 1952. The team was called the Fitzgerald Pioneers. The club had no affiliation with any major league club during the five seasons of operation in the Georgia State League. After the 1952 season, the Fitzgerald Pioneers relocated to Sandersville and became the Sandersville Wacos, which were affiliated with the Milwaukee Braves for the 1953 season. The team ended their last season in 1956, under different affiliation.

Fitzgerald got a replacement team for the Pioneers in 1953 when the Moultrie Giants of the Georgia–Florida League moved to town. The Moultrie club was a charter member of the Georgia–Florida League when it began operations in 1946. After relocating to Fitzgerald and becoming an affiliate of the Cincinnati Redlegs, the new edition of the Fitzgerald Pioneers lasted one season (1954) saw the team name changed to the Fitzgerald Redlegs. After two years in Fitzgerald, the club returned to Moultrie. It ceased operating in 1958 under the name Brunswick Phillies.

After the Fitzgerald Redlegs left, the city was without a team for the 1955 season. The next year the Cordele club relocated to Fitzgerald after ten seasons in Cordele. They changed affiliation back to what were now called the Kansas City A&#x27;s, and the Fitzgerald A&#x27;s played for the 1956 season. In 1957, the club again changed its affiliation, to the Baltimore Orioles; the club was known as the Fitzgerald Orioles for the 1957 season. The Fitzgerald team relocated to Dublin, Georgia after the 1957 season and remained a Baltimore Orioles farm team; they played as the Dublin Orioles for the Georgia–Florida League&#x27;s last year of operation. Fitzgerald has not had a minor league team in the 63 years since.

<doc id="109884" wikidata="Q3261174" url="?curid=109884" title="Alapaha, Georgia">
<text>Alapaha is a town in Berrien County, Georgia, United States, along the Alapaha River. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 481.

Alapaha developed from a trade settlement on the site of a Seminole village with the same name. The present-day Georgia town of Lakeland was originally named &quot;Alapaha&quot; and existed before the town that now bears the name.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Alapaha&quot; was included, along with hundreds of Native American words, in mid-19th-century pronunciation guides as both a river and a village. Even then, opinions differed as to the proper pronunciation of the word, whether it was &quot;A-LAP-Uh-ha,&quot; or &quot;A-LAP-uh-haw.&quot; These guides offer no speculation as to the word&#x27;s meaning. There were many variant names, pronunciations, and spellings of the Alapaha River operant in the late 19th century.

Some ethnologists believe that &quot;Alapaha&quot; was the Creek word for &quot;other side&quot; (cf. Apalachee, Apalachicola); others believe it was the Timucua language word for &quot;bear.&quot; At least one ethnolinguist believed that &quot;Alapaha&quot; is a Creek adaptation of the Timucuan word &quot;arapaha&quot; which meant &quot;bear lodge.&quot; A Timucua town named Arapaha apparently gave its name to the river it was located on. Speakers of one or another of the Muscogean languages, which do not have the &quot;r&quot; sound, may have changed the pronunciation of the name from &quot;Arapaha&quot; to &quot;Alapaha.&quot;

==History==
===Indian presence and early settlement===
The Smithsonian Institution documented the presence of an Indian mound near Alapaha in 1886: &quot;The Alapaha mound is situated northeast of the town of Alapaha, on Alapaha River, on lot of land No. 328, fifth district of Berrien County, Georgia. It is across, above the level, and somewhat oval in shape. In the center of the mound was a burial vault deep, wide, and long, north and south. Two bodies were deposited in this vault with the heads pointing south.&quot; It is possible that these remains became part of the Smithsonian collection, as was typical of its archaeological expeditions at the time. This source also gives the location and contents of two other Berrien County mounds south of Nashville, the Withlacoochee mound, and the French Ferry mound.

Early European settlers were primarily Highland Scots Methodist or Primitive Baptist, representing two socio-economic classes, &quot;Jeffersonian yeomen&quot; and a &quot;squirearchy,&quot; two distinct divisions of landed farmers created by the Georgia Land Lottery of 1820. Between 1820 and 1840, agriculture was principally sheep and cattle herding. With the advent of railroad expansion in the 1830s a sizeable population of Irish Catholic laborers settled in and around the lower Alapaha River, eventually leading to the establishment of St. Anne&#x27;s Catholic church there. Brushy Creek Primitive Baptist Church, originally in Irwin County, figured prominently in local affairs up to and after the Civil War. The Primitive Baptists often opposed the Methodist program of &quot;benevolence&quot; toward less fortunate citizens.

The town of Alapaha was established as a depot on the route of the Brunswick and Albany Railroad near where a road leading from Nashville, Georgia to Edenfield, Georgia crossed the Alapaha River. Early railroad maps refer to it as &quot;Alapaha Station.&quot; It was in existence by at least 1874.

===Boomtown years===
The 1880s and 1890s brought an agricultural and industrial boom in forestry, timber, and naval stores. There were several sawmills in Alapaha by 1880, including &quot;Alapaha Steam Saw Mills, established 16 years&quot; which ran a weekly advertisement in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, boasting that Sloat, Bussell, &amp; Co. were prepared to ship from Savannah or Brunswick &quot;a Superior Article of Long leaf, close-grained, untapped Georgia Pitch Pine,&quot; guaranteed never to have been &quot;injured&quot; by turpentine extraction. Alapaha Steam Saw Mills listed its business addresses as 116 Wall Street, New York City, and 76 Bay Street, Savannah.

In 1881, Alapaha received prominent mention in a promotional pamphlet on the excellence of economic opportunity in South Georgia. The pamphlet was published &quot;under the auspices&quot; of the Savannah, Florida, and Western Railroad, the Brunswick and Albany Railroad, and the Macon &amp; Brunswick Railroad, for the benefit of &quot;Timber Men, Lumber Manufacturers, Fruit Growers, Vegetable Growers, Tourists, Invalids, Pleasure Seekers, Travellers, Parties Seeking New Homes, --and--All Who Desire To Better Their Condition.&quot; It devoted significant space to Alapaha, calling it &quot;an important wool market,&quot; and &quot;a lively and business-like little village,&quot; with &quot;six stores with mixed stocks, and three bar-rooms.&quot; Its aggregate annual sales reached $100,000, and it had &quot;two physicians, two lawyers, and one dentist&quot; and &quot;a sprightly newspaper.&quot; Calling it a &quot;land of promise,&quot; the anonymous writer (probably a Mr. Lastinger who was the newspaper editor) wrote, &quot;Bee culture is also carried on; the honey is as rich as that from California.&quot;

From the &quot;Macon Telegraph&quot;, March 24, 1886, in an article titled &quot;At Alapaha. Her New Hotel. Her Clever Social People. Her Prosperous Merchants, Etc.,&quot;: &quot;...a new hotel, two stories high, nicely fitted up and well kept. Dr. J.A. Fogle, one of the most clever men you would met in a week&#x27;s hard riding, is the proprietor, but his time is mostly devoted to an extensive practice and to his well-stocked drug store. The hotel is presided over by Mrs. Fogle, a lady of refinement and most pleasant manner, ably assisted by her sister, Miss Fannie Leonard. The table is bountifully supplied with tempting fare, the sleeping apartments are models of cleanliness and comfort, and the attention to guests is prompt and courteous The commercial tourists are fond in their praise of it, and you know they are, generally speaking, a difficult set to please.&quot; This building is still intact, and is now a private home.

In the spring of 1897, a catastrophic fire destroyed four uninsured buildings in the downtown section of Alapaha. The &quot;Macon Telegraph&quot; reported that a bucket brigade of both black and white citizens worked to save the buildings, which had begun to burn after midnight. Lost were a store belonging to H.B. Young, a sewing machine repair business belonging to Mr. Norton, who managed to save his tools and materials, a two-story building owned by J.H. Baker, an old livery stable run by J.S. Turner, and a storehouse managed by W.S. Walker that contained of wine, an iron safe, and books and papers. Two of the buildings were owned by a T. Cook. The paper reported that &quot;the cause of the fire is not known, but the general opinion is that someone must have set it on fire.&quot;

===20th century to present===

The 1907 roster of the Georgia Medical Association lists two physicians from Alapaha, W.A. Moore and G.A. Paulk.

Alapaha was the site of a famous Atlantic Coast Line Railroad train wreck on March 26, 1911, when the Dixie Flyer derailed on a high trestle across the Alapaha River, killing ten and injuring many, including wealthy Northern socialites who were traveling to the coast.

On December 30, 1914, a patent application for a &quot;portable shower-bath&quot; with a detailed diagram was submitted by inventor Robert Alex Rutland of Alapaha, and witnessed by E.F. Tiller and W.M. Gaskins, local entrepreneurs. The patent was granted by the U.S. Patent Office on July 20, 1915.

On July 4, 1918, the &quot;Alapaha&quot;, a wooden paddle-wheeler Ferris-type cargo ship whose dead-weight tonnage was 3,500, registered in Cornwells Heights, Pennsylvania, was christened and launched. The ship routinely transported cargo such as coal between Philadelphia and the French cities of Rouen and Le Havre. The vessel was featured in a &quot;New York Tribune&quot; headline &quot;Freighter in Distress,&quot; reported to be off the Atlantic Coast, &quot;heavy seas breaking over her deck, her steam pipes were broken; her seams had opened up and several feet of water were in her hold.&quot; The freighter survived, only to meet with delays during the marine workers&#x27; union strikes of 1919.

Alapaha lost four men (of 25 total from Berrien County) in the infamous &quot;Otranto&quot; troopship disaster off the coast of Scotland, eight weeks before the Armistice ended World War I. Their names and hometowns were published among 200 dead in the &quot;New York Times&quot; coverage. They were James Malcolm McMillan, Arthur Harper, William Hayes, and B.F. McCranie.
The Alapaha Colored School, one of the historic place listings in Berrien County, was the only school for African American children in the northern part of the county for three decades, starting in 1924. Atypical for rural Georgia, it had four classrooms and two stories, accommodating boys and girls in eleven grades; it closed in 1954 when Berrien County&#x27;s African American schools were consolidated in Nashville.

A tornado on May 11, 1952, led to national headlines. The business area of the town was decimated and the water tower was smashed. The Red Cross set up field operations, bringing in a director from Moody Air Force Base and a mobile kitchen from Fort Benning.

In 1963, the U.S. Department of Labor won a lawsuit, &quot;Wirtz v. Alapaha Yellow Pine Products&quot;, Inc., against a locally owned sawmill. At issue were Fair Labor Standards Act violations concerning overtime pay. The case became a minor landmark in labor litigation history; the case is frequently cited as a precedent for denying defendants in similar suits to have their cases heard by a jury.

On October 3, 1966, Army Master Sgt. James Emory Jones of Alapaha, one of the first members of the elite Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (MAC-SOG), a black-operations unit of the Vietnam War, was killed in a secret attempt to wire-tap North Vietnamese communications lines in Laos. The existence of this secret unit was concealed for many years, as well as its operations outside borders of Vietnam. Jones&#x27;s entire three-man commando unit was lost; evidence suggests that the unit requested U.S. bombers fire upon its coordinates when they knew they could not escape ambush. Jones&#x27;s fate and place of death were kept secret for many years, and he was listed as &quot;missing in action&quot; for over two decades.

The 1996 novel &quot;The Wonder Book of the Air&quot; () by Cynthia Shearer is set in Alapaha and includes much of the town&#x27;s history.

Just outside the town is the site where the famous &quot;Hogzilla,&quot; a &quot;wild&quot; hog weighing in at about , was shot on June 17, 2004, on a commercial hunting farm. The carcass of the hog was exhumed for a National Geographic special.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

=== Climate ===
The climate in this area is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Alapaha has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.


==Demographics==

In 2010, its population was 668, though by 2020 its population declined to 481.

==Government==
Alapaha was incorporated in 1881 by an act (Law #433) of the General Assembly of the Georgia legislature. That act set forth the framework for its municipal government, specifying that there be a mayor, aldermen, regular elections, taxes, licensing of &quot;ten-pin alleys, billiard and pool tables, and other establishments calculated to encourage idleness&quot; as well as &quot;spiritous liquors.&quot; The corporate limits of the town were set at a quarter-mile from the junction of Main and Center streets in every direction.

In its entire history, the town has only grown ¾ of a square mile, despite early efforts to promote it for development.

Alapaha&#x27;s city hall is located in the former depot that once served the Brunswick and Albany Railroad, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, and the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad.

==In popular culture==
The Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog breed was developed from the Paulk plantation dogs of the area. They were first registered with the Animal Research Foundation by Lana Lou Lane of Rebecca, Georgia in 1986. She gave the breed the name because the Alapaha River ran near her home.

The Alapaha blueberry is a patented rabbiteye blueberry named for the Alapaha River, and tested at Alapaha. Its berries are medium in size and have excellent firmness, color and flavor.

&quot;The Alapaha Blues (The Catfish Dance)&quot; is a song by Brian Buffington.

<text>Enigma is a town in Berrien County, Georgia, United States. The population was 1,278 at the 2010 census, and 1,058 in 2020. The origin of the name &quot;Enigma&quot; is obscure; the name is itself an enigma. Enigma has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names.

==History==
Enigma is a small town in South Georgia located in the northwest tip of Berrien County, east of Tifton, on U.S. Highway 82. The town was founded between 1876 and 1880 by John A. Ball. It was not initially named &quot;Enigma&quot;. Originally a settlement, it was commonly referred to as &quot;Gunn and Weston&quot; until Ball decided he wanted a real name for this town. Two names, &quot;Lax&quot; and &quot;Enigma&quot;, were proposed to state officials for review. Lax was already taken by another nearby settlement, and so &quot;Enigma&quot; became the official name. Enigma is an odd name for a town; by definition it means a puzzle or mystery. Ball said, &quot;It was a puzzle what to name it anyway.&quot; The town was incorporated on August 21, 1906.
Ball and his family originated in Raleigh, North Carolina, traveling to Georgia on the Brunswick and Western Railroad. He became the town&#x27;s first postmaster, and not long afterward, Capt J.B. Gunn from Terrell County, Georgia, came as an assistant. Ball and his son Jim started a turpentine business around 1878. Ball returned to Raleigh to bring back a man named Tubb Daughtry and his family to help run the business. He gave them land to live on and permission to worship as they pleased. The turpentine business soon dwindled, and lumber became the main focus. Capt. J. B. Gunn and Capt. S. R. Weston built a sawmill two miles east of Enigma. H. F. Stewart came to work in the sawmill.

Other businesses opened in Enigma throughout the years, including a grocery, merchandise, and hardware stores. E.F. Bussey set up a merchandise store in a building owned at one time by Gunn. This building also housed the U.S. Post Office and sold coffins on its second story. It was located on the south side of the railroad. The railroad&#x27;s closest depot was in Brookfield, away. Enigma had a doctor&#x27;s office run by G.R. Parker. There have been three banks in Enigma throughout the years. Two banks were started around 1915 to 1917, and the other one was started in 1973. The People&#x27;s Bank opened in 1915 and closed in 1916, and the Ambrose-Enigma Banking Company opened on June 5, 1917, and closed around 1920. The Bank of Alapaha opened a branch in Enigma on March 1, 1973, and is still in business.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.14%, is water.

==Demographics==
At the census of 2000, there were 869 people, 313 households, and 231 families residing in the town. By 2020, its population was 1,058.

==Education==
The Enigma school was located on the north side of town. It started as a one-room school house, then moved to a three-room school house. A large brick building was built in 1926 to serve as a new school, also on the north side, just across from Highway 82. In the fall of 1954 all county high schools were consolidated into Berrien High in Nashville, the county seat. The original Enigma school building was still in use as part of the elementary school when it burned in October 1973. The gymnasium and cafeteria were still standing, and portable classrooms were brought in so the school could continue until it was rebuilt. Enigma Elementary School was never rebuilt, and the mobile units continued serving the school until it closed at the end of the 1987–88 school year. Enigma Elementary merged with West Berrien Elementary School starting with the 1988–89 school year. The new Northwest Elementary School was housed on the old West Berrien campus. Northwest Elementary School was closed in 1994 in the final consolidation of schools in the county. Now all children are bussed to Berrien Primary, Berrien Elementary, Berrien Middle, and Berrien High in Nashville. The Enigma School grounds now serve as the Enigma City Park.

<text>Nashville is a city in and the county seat of Berrien County, Georgia, United States. The population was 7,029 at the 2022 census estimates. It is called the &quot;City of Dogwoods&quot;, as the tree grows in large numbers around the area.

==History==

Nashville was founded about 1840. In 1856, Nashville was designated seat of the newly formed Berrien County. It was incorporated as a town in 1892 and as a city in 1900. While some say the city is named after Francis Nash (1742–1777), an officer in the American Revolutionary War, many historical articles in the local newspaper claim otherwise. &quot; The Berrien Press&quot; published an article in its November 22, 2006 edition under the title of &quot;Will the Naming of Nashville Controversy Ever Be Truly Settled?&quot; The 2006 article pointed to &quot;The Griffin Papers&quot;, written in the 1930s, and several articles from &quot;The Nashville Herald&quot; - December 24, 1909, October 14, 1910, January 19, 1933, June 13, 1935, June 29, 1944, October 12, 1950, November 27, 1952, and March 5, 1953. Every one of these articles, and the 1956 Berrien County Centennial plates all lay claim to Nashville being named after Simon W. Nash, a local citizen of the 1850s and 1860s.

<doc id="109888" wikidata="Q219656" url="?curid=109888" title="Macon, Georgia">
<text>Macon ( ), officially Macon–Bibb County, is a consolidated city-county in Georgia, United States. Situated near the fall line of the Ocmulgee River, it is southeast of Atlanta and near the state&#x27;s geographic center—hence its nickname &quot;The Heart of Georgia&quot;.

Macon&#x27;s population was 157,346 in the 2020 census. It is the principal city of the Macon metropolitan statistical area, which had 234,802 people in 2020. It also is the largest city in the Macon–Warner Robins combined statistical area (CSA), which had about 420,693 residents in 2017, and adjoins the Atlanta metropolitan area to the northwest.

Voters approved the consolidation of the City of Macon and Bibb County governments in a 2012 referendum. Macon became the state&#x27;s fourth-largest city (after Augusta) when the merger became official on January 1, 2014.

Macon is served by three interstate highways: I-16 (connecting to Savannah and coastal Georgia), I-75 (connecting to Atlanta to the north and Valdosta to the south), and I-475 (a city bypass highway). The area has two, small, general-aviation airports, Middle Georgia Regional Airport and Herbert Smart Downtown Airport. Residents traveling to and from the area mainly use the large commercial airport in Atlanta, roughly 80 miles to the northwest.

The city has several institutions of higher education and numerous museums and tourism sites.

==History==

Macon was founded on the site of the Ocmulgee Old Fields, where the Creek Indians lived in the 18th century. Their predecessors, the Mississippian culture, built a powerful agriculture-based chiefdom (950–1100 AD). The Mississippian culture constructed earthwork mounds for ceremonial, religious, and burial purposes. Indigenous peoples inhabited the areas along the Southeast&#x27;s rivers for 13,000 years before Europeans arrived.

Macon was developed at the site of Fort Benjamin Hawkins, built in 1809 at President Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s direction after he forced the Creek to cede their lands east of the Ocmulgee River. (Archeological excavations in the 21st century found evidence of two separate fortifications.) The fort was named for Benjamin Hawkins, who served as superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Southeast territory south of the Ohio River for more than 20 years, had lived among the Creek, and was married to a Creek woman. Located at the fall line of the Ocmulgee River, the fort established a trading post with native peoples at the river&#x27;s most inland point navigable from the Low Country.

Fort Hawkins guarded the Lower Creek Pathway, an extensive and well-traveled American Indian network that the U.S. government later improved as the Federal Road, linking Washington, DC, to the ports of Mobile, Alabama, and New Orleans, Louisiana. Used for trading with the Creek, the fort also was used by state militia and federal troops. It was a major military distribution point during the War of 1812 and the Creek War of 1813. After the wars, it was a trading post and garrisoned troops until 1821. Decommissioned around 1828, it later burned to the ground. A replica of the southeast blockhouse, built in 1938, stands on an east Macon hill. Fort Hawkins Grammar School occupied part of the site. In the 21st century, archeological excavations have revealed more of the fort, increasing its historical significance, and led to further reconstruction planning for this major historical site.

With the arrival of more settlers, Fort Hawkins was renamed &quot;Newtown&quot;. After Bibb County&#x27;s organization in 1822, the city was chartered as the county seat in 1823 and officially named Macon, in honor of Nathaniel Macon, a statesman from North Carolina, from where many early Georgia residents hailed. City planners envisioned &quot;a city within a park&quot; and created a city of spacious streets and landscapes. Over were dedicated for Central City Park, and ordinances required residents to plant shade trees in their front yards.
Because of the beneficial local Black Belt geology and the availability of slave labor, cotton became the mainstay of Macon&#x27;s early economy. The city&#x27;s location on the Ocmulgee River aided initial economic expansion, providing shipping access to new markets. Cotton steamboats, stagecoaches, and the 1843 arrival of the railroad increased marketing opportunities and contributed to Macon&#x27;s economic prosperity.

Macon&#x27;s growth had other benefits. In 1836, the Georgia Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church chose Macon as the location for Wesleyan College, the first U.S. college to grant women college degrees. Nonetheless, Macon came in last in the 1855 referendum voting to be Georgia&#x27;s capital city with 3,802 votes.

During the American Civil War, Macon served as the official arsenal of the Confederacy manufacturing percussion caps, friction primers, and pressed bullets. Camp Oglethorpe was established as a prison for captured Union officers and enlisted men. Later, it held only officers, at one time numbering 2,300. The camp was evacuated in 1864.

Macon City Hall served as the temporary state capitol in 1864 and was converted to a hospital for wounded Confederate soldiers. Union General William Tecumseh Sherman spared Macon on his march to the sea. His troops sacked the nearby state capital of Milledgeville, and Maconites prepared for an attack. Sherman, however, passed by without entering Macon.

The &quot;Macon Telegraph&quot; reported the city had furnished 23 companies of men for the Confederacy, but casualties were high. By the war&#x27;s end, Maconite survivors fit for duty could fill only five companies.

The city was taken by Union forces during Wilson&#x27;s Raid on April 20, 1865.
Because of its central location, Macon developed as a state transportation hub. In 1895, &quot;The New York Times&quot; dubbed Macon &quot;The Central City&quot; because of its emergence as a railroad transportation and textile factory hub. Terminal Station was built in 1916. In the 20th century, Macon grew into a prospering town in Middle Georgia.

Macon has been impacted by natural catastrophes. In 1994, Tropical Storm Alberto made in Florida and flooded several Georgia cities. Macon, which received of rain, suffered major flooding.

On May 11, 2008, an EF2 tornado hit Macon. Touching down in nearby Lizella, the tornado moved along the southern shore of Lake Tobesofkee, continued into Macon, and lifted in Twiggs County. The storm&#x27;s total path length was , and its path width was . The tornado produced sporadic areas of major damage, with widespread straight-line wind damage to the south of its path. The most significant damage was along Eisenhower Parkway and Pio Nono Avenue in Macon, where two businesses were destroyed and several others were heavily damaged. The tornado also impacted Macon State College, where almost 50% of the campus&#x27;s trees were snapped or uprooted and several buildings were damaged, with the gymnasium.

On July 31, 2012, voters in Macon (57.8% approval) and Bibb County (56.7% approval) passed a referendum to merge the governments of the city of Macon and most of unincorporated Bibb County. The vote came after the Georgia General Assembly passed House Bill 1171, authorizing the referendum earlier in the year; Four previous consolidation attempts (in 1933, 1960, 1972, and 1976) failed.

As a result of the referendum, the Macon and Bibb County governments were replaced with a mayor and a nine-member county commission elected by districts, and a portion of Macon extending into nearby Jones County was disincorporated. Robert Reichert was elected the first mayor of Macon-Bibb in the September 2013 election, which required a runoff with C. Jack Ellis in October.

===Baconsfield Park===
U.S. Senator Augustus Bacon, of Georgia, in his 1911 will, devised land in Macon in trust, to be used as a public park for the exclusive benefit of white people. The park, known as Baconsfield, was operated in that manner for many years. In &quot;Evans v. Newton&quot;, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the park could not continue to be operated on a racially discriminatory basis. The Supreme Court of Georgia thereupon declared &quot;that the sole purpose for which the trust was created has become impossible of accomplishment&quot; and remanded the case to the trial court, which held cy-près doctrine to be inapplicable, since the park&#x27;s segregated character was an essential and inseparable part of Bacon&#x27;s plan. The trial court ruled that the trust failed and that the property reverted to Bacon&#x27;s heirs. The Supreme Court of Georgia and the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed. The 50-acre (20 ha) park was lost and commercially developed.
