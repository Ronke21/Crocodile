==History==
In the late summer and the fall of 1811, William Henry Harrison, the governor of the Indiana Territory, organized a military expedition against the increasing resistance of the federation of Native American tribes being formed by the Shawnee brothers and chiefs, Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa, who was also known as the Prophet. With their community of Prophetstown as his objective, General Harrison marched from Vincennes, Indiana, at the head of a small army of about 1,000 men.
General Harrison met with representatives of the Prophet on November 6, 1811, when he arrived at Prophetstown. He presented demands in the name of his government. Harrison was to meet with the Prophet and his council the next day about the demands of the government. Harrison set up his encampment on a ridge about a mile northwest of Prophet&#x27;s Town.

Fearing a surprise attack by the Prophet&#x27;s forces, General Harrison placed his troops in battle formation, instructed his men to sleep fully clothed, and assigned a large detail of men for sentinel duty. On the morning of November 7, 1811, after 4:00, the camp was attacked by the Prophet.

After a fierce battle, Harrison and his army defeated the Prophet&#x27;s Indian confederation at the Battle of Tippecanoe. The defeat all but ended the Indian wars in the Midwest, especially as Tecumseh was killed at the Battle of the Thames in Canada in 1813.

Battle Ground was consolidated in 1867 with the Town of Harrisonville. The governments of both towns decided to name the consolidation Battle Ground. The Town of Battle Ground was named for the Battle of Tippecanoe, and the Town of Harrisonville was named after Harrison, the commander of the American forces of the Battle of Tippecanoe.

The Tippecanoe Battlefield monument was erected in 1908 and dedicated to the men who served and were killed in the Battle of Tippecanoe. The battlefield has been designated a National Historic Landmark and includes a museum and recreation area. The &quot;Battle of Tippecanoe Outdoor Drama&quot; premiered at a nearby amphitheater in Battle Ground in 1989 and played for two summers.

The post office at Battle Ground has been in operation since 1835.

Battle Ground Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

<text>Lafayette ( ) is a city in and is the county seat of Tippecanoe County, Indiana, United States, located northwest of Indianapolis and southeast of Chicago. According to the 2020 census, the population of Lafayette was 70,783. West Lafayette, on the other side of the Wabash River, is home to Purdue University, which contributes significantly to both communities. Together, they form the core of the Lafayette metropolitan area, which had a population of 235,066 in 2020.

Lafayette was founded in 1825 on the southeast bank of the Wabash River near where the river becomes impassable for riverboats upstream, though a French fort and trading post had existed since 1717 on the opposite bank and three miles downstream. It was named for the French general Marquis de Lafayette, a Revolutionary War hero.

==History==
When European explorers arrived at this area, it was inhabited by a tribe of Miami Native Americans known as the Ouiatenon or Weas. In 1717, the French government established Fort Ouiatenon across the Wabash River and south of present-day Lafayette. The fort became the center of trade for fur trappers, merchants and Indians. An annual reenactment and festival known as Feast of the Hunters&#x27; Moon is held there each autumn.

The town of Lafayette was platted in May 1825 by William Digby, a trader. It was designated as the county seat of the newly formed Tippecanoe County the following year. Like many frontier towns, Lafayette was named for General Lafayette, a French officer who significantly aided George Washington&#x27;s Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Lafayette toured the United States in 1824 and 1825.

In its earliest days, Lafayette was a shipping center on the Wabash River. In 1838, Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, the first United States Patent Commissioner, published a booklet titled &quot;Valley of the Upper Wabash, Indiana, with Hints on Its Agricultural Advantages,&quot; to promote settlement of the region. By 1845, Ellsworth had purchased of farmland around Lafayette and moved there from Connecticut to supervise land sales. By 1847 Ellsworth was distributing broadsides looking for farmers to purchase his farmland. He became president of the Tippecanoe County Agricultural Society in April 1851 – despite some local resentment over what was called &quot;the Yale Crowd&quot; – but he was defeated the same year when he ran for the Indiana House of Representatives. Ellsworth Street and Ellsworth Historic District are named for him.

The Wabash and Erie Canal in the 1840s stimulated trade and affirmed Lafayette&#x27;s regional prominence. Railroads arrived in the town in the 1850s, connecting it with other major markets. The Monon Railroad connected Lafayette with other sections of Indiana.

Lafayette was the site of the first official airmail delivery in the United States on 17 August 1859, when John Wise piloted a balloon starting on the Lafayette courthouse grounds. Wise hoped to reach New York; however, weather conditions forced the balloon down near Crawfordsville, Indiana, and the mail reached its final destination by train. In 1959, the US Postal Service issued a 7¢ airmail stamp commemorating the centennial of the event.

<text>West Lafayette ( ) is a city in Tippecanoe County, Indiana, United States, approximately northwest of the state capital of Indianapolis and southeast of Chicago. West Lafayette is directly across the Wabash River from its sister city, Lafayette. As of the 2020 census, its population was 44,595. It is home to Purdue University and is a college town and the most densely populated city in Indiana.

==History==
Augustus Wylie laid out a town in 1836 in the Wabash River floodplain south of the present Levee. Due to regular flooding of the site, Wylie&#x27;s town was never built. The present city was formed in 1888 by the merger of the adjacent suburban towns of Chauncey, Oakwood, and Kingston, located on a bluff across the Wabash River from Lafayette, Indiana. The three towns had been small suburban villages which were directly adjacent to one another. Kingston was laid out in 1855 by Jesse B. Lutz. Chauncey was platted in 1860 by the Chauncey family of Philadelphia, wealthy land speculators. Chauncey and Kingston formed a municipal government in 1866 which selected the name &quot;Chauncey&quot;.

The new town of Chauncey remained a small suburban village until Purdue University opened in 1869. In 1871 Chauncey voted to be annexed by Lafayette because it was unable to provide the infrastructure (such as improved streets, waterworks, police and fire protection). Lafayette voted against annexing Chauncey because of the high cost of the many improvements that the village lacked. In May 1888, the town of Chauncey voted to change its name to West Lafayette after a petition signed by 152 electors. By that time, the growth of the university was fueling the growth of the little town. The address of Purdue University was given as &quot;Lafayette, Indiana&quot; until well into the twentieth century. West Lafayette never gained a railroad depot and lagged several years behind Lafayette in the establishment of municipal infrastructure and services. Today, West Lafayette has established itself as a separate city, with independent services and unique neighborhoods distinct from those of its sister city, Lafayette.

In November 2013, the City of West Lafayette approved an annexation that placed much of the Purdue University academic campus and residence hall system within the official boundaries of the municipality for the first time. This expansion also included a large section of the US Highway 231 corridor that was previously part of unincorporated Tippecanoe County.

Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity House, Jesse Andrew House, Chauncey-Stadium Avenues Historic District, John E. and Catherine E. Christian House, Curtis-Grace House, Happy Hollow Heights Historic District, Hills and Dales Historic District, Morton School, and The Varsity are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
West Lafayette lies in central Tippecanoe County and overlooks the Wabash River, which borders the city on the east and south. Most of the city lies in eastern Wabash Township, though a small portion on the northeast side extends into Tippecanoe Township. Elevations range from slightly over near the river to more than in northern parts of the city near U.S. Route 52.

According to the 2010 census, West Lafayette has a total area of , of which (or 99.87%) is land and (or 0.13%) is water.

The Purdue Research Park, established in 1961, is home to more than 140 companies of which nearly 100 are technology related. As of 2009, these companies employ more than 3,000. The Park offers communications infrastructure, research facilities, a business incubation complex to help start-up firms and scenic walking trails and lakes. It is one of the largest university-affiliated research parks in the United States. The Purdue Research Park is owned by Purdue Research Foundation, the University&#x27;s non-profit funding and technology licensing arm.

Commercial activities, however, take place mostly across the river in Lafayette. The largest commercial area in West Lafayette is the Wabash Landing/Levee area, which has become a thriving urban-type district since the entire area was reconstructed and the Pedestrian Bridge to Lafayette replaced the old State Street bridge. The Levee features Wabash Landing, a complex containing shops, restaurants, coffee houses, a 9-screen movie theater, a hotel and the Riverside Skating Center.

==Arts and culture==
The town has a lending library, the West Lafayette Public Library. There is also a branch of the county-run library (Tippecanoe County Public Library) in the Klondike area to the west of the city.

<text>Sharpsville is a town in Liberty Township, Tipton County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. The community is part of the Kokomo, Indiana Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of the 2010 census, Sharpsville&#x27;s population is 607.

==History==
The town was named after founder E.M. Sharp, who originally was from Washington County, Pennsylvania. Sharp moved to Morgan County, Illinois in 1831, prior to relocating to Jennings County, Indiana in 1838. In spring 1849, he moved to Liberty Township. The town was platted on May 24, 1850, under the assumption that Sharpsville would become the county seat for Tipton Township (which became Tipton). A town square was incorporated into the town layout which became a public park rather than the location of a place of government. The town was incorporated in 1873, but it ceased to be incorporated by vote in 1881 and regained village status.

The Sharpsville post office has been in operation since 1851.

Many of the first buildings were churches. The First Methodist church in Sharpsville was built in 1852 and the Richland Evangelical Lutheran Church in 1857. In 1873, the Hopewell Presbyterian Church was founded 2.5 miles east of Sharpsville, with a building being completed for the congregation in 1874.

As the need for local education arose in 1852, Martha Ann Grishaw would become teacher of the first school in Sharpsville. School was held in a wooden cabin. The second school was taught by Lizzie Smith in a small house on the south-side of the town square. The earliest schools were subscription schools where citizens paid a fee to have their children educated. Later a Secondary school was founded as Sharpsville-Prairie High School. In 1970 the High School, along with Windfall High School, merged to form Tri-Central Middle/High School.

Sharpsville was home to participants in the American Civil War . On August 9, 1861, a company assembled in Sharpsville that would join the 26th Indiana Infantry Regiment as Company C. In all, 78 listed on the Company C Roster listed Sharpsville as their town of residence. The 26th Infantry participated in military actions including the Battle of Prairie Grove and the Siege of Vicksburg.

In 1871 a four-story grain elevator was built to give local farmers a way to store grain. The silos had a capacity of 18,500 bushels. While the silos still stand, the elevator was razed in 1990 due to aging of equipment. The granary was serviced by the Nickel Plate Road, a railroad that later become part of Norfolk Southern Railway. The now abandoned tracks once connected Sharpsville to Kokomo and Tipton. A train station that once stood on the southeast corner of Meridian Street and North Street was razed in 1967. In the early 20th century, Sharpsville was serviced by an interurban rail line operated by Union Traction Company. The line connected Sharpsville with Peru, Indiana, to the north and Indianapolis to the south. As with most interurbans, the Sharpsville stop fell out of use by the mid 1920s.

The Sharpsville Cemetery, founded in 1875, is located southeast of the town.

<text>Tipton is a city in and the county seat of Tipton County, Indiana, United States. The population was estimated to be 5,275 as of July 1, 2021.

==History==
The Tipton County Courthouse and Tipton County Jail and Sheriff&#x27;s Home were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

===Samuel King founds Kingston===
The first white person to settle in the area now known as Tipton was Samuel King, who purchased land between 1835 and 1836. The land was still a part of Hamilton County. He resided in Rush County, but visited the area frequently. Strawtown, Indiana, was the closest trading post. King decided to found a town on the land he purchased and he platted the town on April 16, 1839. The town was named Kingston. Despite efforts, King failed to sell any of the plots that he platted. A few Miami Indians resided in the area still.

In January, 1844, Tipton County was founded and a county seat needed to be created. The county seat was originally going to be located in the middle area of the county, however, Miami Indians resided on the land and they were unable to create a town there. The county commissioners put out a call for landowners to propose that the county seat be placed on their land. King offered to donate 100 acres of Kingston. On October 16, 1844, the commissioners accepted his offer.

===Canton===
The commissioners were in charge of also naming the new town. Commissioner John D. Smith, who used to reside in Ohio, proposed to name the town Canton, after Canton, Ohio. The commission accepted the name. After October, it was decided to plat Canton. The area had to be cleared of trees and plants, and John Criswell did the surveying for $2 a day. Sales of the plots began in November. As of March 1845, 34 lots had been sold.

===Canton becomes Tipton===
In 1845, a post office was going to be established in Canton. However, this did not proceed because it was discovered that there was a town already named Canton in the state, which was founded in 1838. The town was renamed Tipton, after John Tipton, a veteran of the Battle of Tippecanoe and the War of 1812. He was also the leader of the Indiana Rangers. Tipton served as United States Senator for Indiana from 1831 until shortly before his death in 1839. Finally, a post office was founded and John S. Ressler became the first postmaster.

Early Tipton was unorganized, with log cabins and poorly built homes riddling the streets and not following the platting. Cows wandered through town and wild game was chased by residents through the streets. It was very rural. There was no telegraph or steam train, so communication with areas outside of the area were rare during this time. Residents lived mainly on hunting. Agriculture was poorly developed. Tipton was also known for flooding and mud, with people having to frequently walk through flood waters and swamp-like areas to get from house to house during wet seasons. By 1850, the population doubled and a physician, Isaac Parker, had founded his practice in the city.

===Cholera epidemic===
Around August 1, 1845, the city entered into a cholera epidemic. The majority of residents fled the city. Livestock began dying of starvation and dehydration due to being left in their pens due to their owners deaths or fleeing of the city. One resident, Mason Lyons, freed all the animals that were still alive, allowing them to wander into the forest to feed. Stores and businesses closed. There were three doctors in town, including Isaac Parker. Over 20 people died. The epidemic lasted approximately one month.

===Late 1800s and incorporation===
In 1854, the Tipton Presbyterian Church was founded in the city, after being dissolved in Normanda. A Christian church was founded in Tipton in 1855. Its congregation met at the Methodist Episcopal church until a church was built in 1870. The congregation built a new church, the West Street Christian church, that was completed in 1908. The court house burnt down in 1857. The Methodist church served as the court house for three years until the new courthouse was finished. In 1872, the Jefferson street canal was built, which helped to drain the surface areas of the town. The canal was nonexistent by 1914. The first Catholic church was built in Tipton in 1874.

<text>Windfall is a town in Wildcat Township, Tipton County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. It is part of the Kokomo, Indiana, Metropolitan Statistical Area. Windfall&#x27;s population was 697 as of the 2021 census.

==History==

=== Founding ===

Windfall was founded by James B. Fouch in 1853. Fouch platted the land with the goal of securing a train station in order to earn business from the lucrative lumber trade. He built the first sawmill in 1853. A Christian church was built just outside Windfall in 1854. The congregation moved to Windfall in 1866. A Methodist church was organized in Windfall in 1857, with meetings taking place in a school house.
The Windfall post office has been in operation since 1855.

There is no definitive history explaining how Windfall was named, but a niece of James B. Fouch told a local newspaper in 1949, “The story has been told to me that Windfall was named by my uncle after a terrific windstorm had swept through the village.”

The village was incorporated on March 24, 1871 by a unanimous vote of the people who had settled there. As other settlers came to the village it grew opposite from the way Fouch intended. As a result, Windfall’s Main Street, the original street, is southwest from the center of the town.
That same year, the Windfall Baptist church was founded.

===Crime in the 1800s===

Windfall has a notable crime history dating from just after its incorporation. In 1865, Noble Goff, a man once described as &quot;respectable..but in later years had fallen into heavy dissipation and had made many enemies,&quot; was murdered with a hatchet while in bed. His wife was charged with his murder and served her time in prison. Henry Thomas was killed by a local doctor, Armstrong, in 1864 or 1865. He killed Thomas out of &quot;jealousy,&quot; and claimed he was not guilty upon trial. The doctor was acquitted.

A few years later a man named Perry was killed in a local saloon over a game of cards. In 1867, a man named Gifford was killed by James Stewart. The two men entered into a fight at Stewart&#x27;s house and Stewart shot him. He was acquitted for self-defense. Finally, the work of a suspected arson burned down a large brick drug store and the nearby home of Dr. McAlaster in 1883.

===1900s===

As of the 20th century, the town was described as being &quot;one of the most attractive communities in Tipton County.&quot; A large Methodist church was built and completed in September 1913. It cost $28,000 to build.

=== World War II ===

From 1944 to 1945 Windfall was home to a World War II German POW camp, Windfall Indiana World War II POW Camp.

<text>Evansville is a city in and the county seat of Vanderburgh County, Indiana, United States. With a population of 118,414 at the 2020 census, it is Indiana&#x27;s third-most populous city after Indianapolis and Fort Wayne, the most populous city in Southern Indiana, and the 249th-most populous city in the United States. It is the central city of the Evansville metropolitan area, a hub of commercial, medical, and cultural activity of southwestern Indiana and the Illinois–Indiana–Kentucky tri-state area, which is home to over 911,000 people. The 38th parallel north crosses the north side of the city and is marked on Interstate 69 immediately north of its junction with Indiana 62 within the city&#x27;s east side.

Situated on an oxbow in the Ohio River, the city is often referred to as the &quot;Crescent Valley&quot; or &quot;River City&quot;. Early French explorers named it &quot;La Belle Rivière&quot; (&quot;The Beautiful River&quot;). The area has been inhabited by various indigenous cultures for millennia, dating back at least 10,000 years. Angel Mounds was a permanent settlement of the Mississippian culture from AD 1000 to around AD 1400. The European-American city was founded in 1812.

Evansville anchors a regional economic hub based primarily on trade, transportation, and utilities; professional and business services; education and health services; government; leisure and hospitality; and manufacturing. Two NYSE-listed companies (Berry Global and OneMain Financial) are headquartered in Evansville, and three companies traded on NASDAQ (Escalade, Old National Bank, and Shoe Carnival) are also headquartered in Evansville.

Evansville is home to Bally&#x27;s Evansville, the state&#x27;s first casino; Mesker Park Zoo and Botanic Garden, one of the state&#x27;s oldest and largest zoos; and sports tourism industry. The city has several notable educational institutions. The University of Evansville is a private school on the city&#x27;s east side, while the University of Southern Indiana is a larger public institution just outside the city&#x27;s westside limits. The Indiana University School of Medicine also maintains a campus in Evansville. Other local educational institutions include the nationally ranked Signature School, the Evansville Vanderburgh Public Library, and the Evansville Vanderburgh School Corporation.

==History==
=== Establishment and early history ===
There has been a continuous human presence in the area that became Evansville from at least 8,000 BC by Paleo-Indians. Archaeologists have identified several archaic and ancient sites in and near Evansville, with the most complex at Angel Mounds. This was built and occupied from about AD 900 to about AD 1600, just before the arrival of Europeans to North America.

Following the abandonment of Angel Mounds between the years 1400 and 1450, tribes of the historic Miami, Shawnee, Piankeshaw, Wyandot, Delaware and other Native American peoples were known to be in the area. French hunters and trappers were among the first Europeans to come to the area, using Vincennes as a base of operations for fur trading. As a testament to the Ohio River&#x27;s grandeur, early French explorers named it &quot;La Belle Rivière&quot; (&quot;The Beautiful River&quot;). The land encompassing Evansville was formally relinquished by the Delaware in 1805 to General William Henry Harrison, then governor of the Indiana Territory.

The city of Evansville, Indiana was founded in 1812 and incorporated in 1817. It is situated on an oxbow in the Ohio River, and is often referred to as the &quot;Crescent Valley&quot; or &quot;River City&quot;.

On March 27, 1812, Hugh McGary Jr. purchased about 441 acres and named it &quot;McGary&#x27;s Landing&quot;. In 1814, to attract more people, McGary renamed his village &quot;Evansville&quot; in honor of Colonel Robert Morgan Evans. Evansville incorporated in 1817 and was designated as the county seat on January 7, 1818. The county was named for Henry Vanderburgh, a deceased chief judge of the Indiana Territorial Supreme Court.

Evansville became a thriving commercial town with a river trade, and the town began to expand outside of its original footprint. Evansville&#x27;s west side was for many years cut off from the city&#x27;s main part by Pigeon Creek and the factories that developed along it, making the creek an industrial corridor. The land comprising the former town of Lamasco was platted in 1837 and was annexed in 1870.

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
Evansville&#x27;s economy received a boost in the early 1830s when Indiana unveiled plans to build the longest canal in the world, a 400-mile ditch to connect the Great Lakes at Toledo, Ohio with the inland rivers at Evansville. The project was intended to open Indiana to commerce and improve transportation from New Orleans to New York City. The project bankrupted the state and was so poorly engineered that it would not hold water. By the time the Wabash and Erie Canal was finished in 1853, Evansville&#x27;s first railroad, Evansville &amp; Crawfordsville Railroad, was opened to Terre Haute. The expansion of railroads in this territory had made the canal obsolete. Only two flat barges ever made the entire trip. The canal basin at Fifth and Court street in downtown Evansville became the site of a new courthouse in 1891.

The era of Evansville&#x27;s greatest growth occurred in the second half of the 19th century, following the disruptions of the Civil War. The city was a major stop for steamboats along the Ohio River, and it was the home port for a number of companies engaged in trade via the river. Coal mining, manufacturing, and hardwood lumber was a major source of economic activity. By 1900, Evansville was one of the world&#x27;s largest hardwood furniture centers, with 41 factories employing approximately 2,000 workers. Railroads eventually became more important and in 1887 the L&amp;N Railroad constructed a bridge across the Ohio River. Along with a major rail yard southwest of Evansville in Howell, which was annexed in 1916 and completed the city&#x27;s counterclockwise march around the horseshoe bend.

Throughout this period, Evansville&#x27;s main ethnic groups consisted of Protestant Scotch-Irish from the South, Catholic Irish coming for canal or railroad work, New England businessmen, Germans fleeing Europe after the 1848 revolutions, and freedmen from western Kentucky. By the 1890 census, Evansville ranked as the 56th-largest urban area in the United States, but it was surpassed in population by other cities in the early 1900s. As the new century began, the city continued to develop to its eastern areas. Manufacturing also took off, particularly in the automobile and refrigeration industries.

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===

The Graham brothers, Ray, Robert, and Joseph, got their start with a successful glass factory in Evansville. After they sold it in 1907, the glass factory became Libbey-Owens-Ford. In 1916, seeing the need for a dependable truck, the Graham brothers entered the truck chassis business. Evansville was home to Graham Brothers Trucks from then until 1929. The dependability of Graham trucks was due in part to their use of Torbensen internal gear drive rear axles.

In 1921, after the death of both Dodge brothers, Graham Brothers started selling 1.5 ton pickups through Dodge dealers. (Dodge did not manufacture trucks at the time). These vehicles had Graham chassis and some Dodge parts. Dodge Brothers bought a controlling interest in Graham Brothers in 1925, picking up the rest in 1926.

The city saw exponential growth in the early twentieth century with the production of lumber and the manufacturing of furniture. By 1920, Evansville had more than two dozen furniture companies. In the decades of the 1920s and 1930s, city leaders attempted to improve Evansville&#x27;s transportation position and successfully lobbied to be on the Chicago-to-Miami &quot;Dixie Bee Highway&quot; (U.S. Highway 41). A bridge was built across the Ohio River in 1932 and in that same decade steps were taken to develop an airport.

But the Ohio River flood of 1937 covered 500 city blocks in Evansville, resulting in a major crisis. With steamboats less necessary to the local economy, city and federal officials responded to the flood and its destruction by constructing more and higher levees: construction that penned and hid the Ohio River behind a barrier of earthen berms and concrete walls.

During World War II, Evansville was a major center of industrial production which helped revive the regional economy after the Great Depression. A huge, 45-acre shipyard complex was constructed on the riverfront east of St. Joseph Avenue for the production of oceangoing LSTs (Landing Ship-Tanks). The Evansville Shipyard was the nation&#x27;s largest inland producer of LSTs. The Plymouth factory was converted into a plant which turned out &quot;bullets by the billions,&quot; and many other companies switched over to the manufacture of war material. In 1942, an aircraft factory was constructed adjacent to the airport north of the city for the manufacture of the Republic P-47D fighter aircraft, the legendary P-47 Thunderbolt. Evansville produced a total of 6,242 P-47s, almost half of the P-47s made nationally during the war.

After the war, Evansville&#x27;s manufacturing base of automobiles, household appliances, and farm equipment benefited from growing post-war demand. A growing housing demand also caused residential development to leap north and east of the city. However, between 1955 and 1963, a nationwide recession hit Evansville. Among other closures, Servel (which produced refrigerators) went out of business and Chrysler ended its local operations. The economy was saved from near total collapse by 28 businesses that moved into the area, including Whirlpool, Alcoa, and General Electric.

During the final third of the 20th century, Evansville became the hub of the tri-state region&#x27;s commercial, medical, and service industries. A 1990s economic spurt was fueled by the growth of the University of Southern Indiana. The arrival of giant Toyota and AK Steel manufacturing plants, as well as Casino Aztar (now Bally&#x27;s), Indiana&#x27;s first gaming boat, also contributed to the growth of jobs. As the twenty-first century began, Evansville continued in a steady pace of economic diversification and stability.

On December 6, 2022, in recognition of the city&#x27;s massive production efforts during World War II, it was announced that Evansville had been designated Indiana&#x27;s American World War II Heritage City by the National Park Service.

==Geography==
The Evansville metropolitan area, the 142nd largest in the United States, includes three Indiana counties (Posey, Vanderburgh, and Warrick) and two Kentucky counties (Henderson, and Webster). The metropolitan area does not include Owensboro, Kentucky, which is an adjacent metropolitan area about southeast of Evansville. This area is sometimes referred to as &quot;Kentuckiana&quot;, although it is usually referred to as the “tri-state&quot; by the local media.

According to the 2010 census, Evansville has an area of , of which (or 98.94%) is land and (or 1.06%) is water.

===Topography===
The city&#x27;s southern boundary lies on an oxbow in the Ohio River. Most of the city lies in a shallow valley surrounded by low rolling hills. The city&#x27;s west side is built on these rolling hills and is home to Burdette Park, Mesker Amphitheatre, and Mesker Park Zoo. The eastern portion developed in the valley and is protected by a series of levees that closely follow the path of I-69. Notable landmarks on the east side are the Wesselman Woods Nature Preserve and the Angel Mounds State Historic Site, just southeast of Evansville, between Evansville and Newburgh.

===Cityscape===
&quot;For more details on this topic, see List of tallest buildings in Evansville&quot;

Evansville&#x27;s original downtown plat was made on about 200 acres, with streets running parallel to the river from northwest to southeast. Other streets nearby were later laid out on the cardinal points, due north–south, and east–west. Thus, anyone entering or leaving downtown finds the street makes a confusing oblique-angle turn in one direction or another. In the 1970s, the city suffered from problems such as decreased economic activity and suburban flight, but city-sponsored revitalization has improved downtown conditions.

The business district and riverfront feature land-based casino gambling, restaurants, bars, and shops that attract tens of thousands of visitors each year. Although much of the outer city&#x27;s architecture is typical suburban design, the city&#x27;s downtown district retains early twentieth-century architecture. A few blocks east of the main business district is the Riverside district, featuring tree-lined brick streets full of turn of the twentieth-century homes. The Reitz Home Museum is one of the finest examples of French second empire architecture in the United States. Other homes nearby feature similar character and design and include Italianate, Colonial Revival, and Renaissance Revival styles.

===Neighborhoods===

===Pollution===
In August 2018, the mayor of Evansville sent a letter to the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission (ORVWSO) opposing a proposal to eliminate pollution control standards for the Ohio River. Evansville is located downstream from the river&#x27;s origin. Sources of pollution that affect water quality include agricultural runoff, raw sewage discharges from combined sewer overflows, and toxic chemicals released by companies with water pollution permits. The state of Indiana issues a fish consumption advisory for fish from the Ohio River based on PCB contamination. The recommended consumption limit for most fish, including carp, striped bass and flathead catfish is no more than 8 oz. per month, but for channel catfish, the recommendation is only 8oz every two months.

Six very large coal-fired power plant complexes operate within 30 miles of Evansville: Indiana-Michigan Power&#x27;s Rockport Generating Station, near Rockport, Indiana, AES Indiana&#x27;s Petersburg Generating Station near Petersburg, and Duke Energy&#x27;s Gibson Generating Station near Mount Carmel. Evansville-based Vectren operates the other two; the A. B. Brown Generating Station, located just west of Evansville, and Warrick County Generating Station/F. B. Culley Generating Station complex, east of Newburgh, largely owned by Alcoa. In addition, another coal fired power plant complex, The R.D. Green Station, operated by Touchstone Energy&#x27;s Big Rivers Electric, exists 20 miles south of Evansville, near Sebree, Kentucky. The levels of fine particles in the air in Vanderburgh County were almost as high as in Manhattan, New York City.

A large portion of the downtown and north side areas were declared contaminated by lead and arsenic because of factory dumping dating back to the Civil War. Contractors have been working for more than 20 years to dig up the lawns of residents to make them safe for children to play. About 18 inches of contaminated dirt is dug up from each yard then dumped in a nearby landfill. The work has many more years to go.

Today, the city is served by four major freight railroads, CSX (with a major yard in the Howell area), Evansville Western Railway, the Indiana Southwestern Railway, and the Norfolk Southern Railway. The Howell Yard in Evansville sorts and makes up trains, and has intermodal facilities to handle 3,000 cargo containers and piggyback trailers per month

Three public and several private port facilities receive year-round service from five major barge lines operating on the Ohio River. The river connects Evansville with all river markets in the central United States and on the Great Lakes and with international markets through the port of New Orleans. Evansville has been a U.S. Customs port of entry for more than 125 years. Because of this, it is possible to have international cargo shipped to Evansville in bond. The international cargo can then clear Customs in Evansville rather than a coastal port.

===Utilities===
Electricity and natural gas are both provided to Evansville by CenterPoint Energy. Water and sewer services are provided by the Evansville Water &amp; Sewer Utility, which provides water to more than 75,000 customers in Evansville and the surrounding area. The Ohio River provides for most of the city&#x27;s source of drinking water. Water is drawn from the river and filtered at a 60 million gallon per day treatment plant. There are approximately 1,000 miles of water mains in the system and includes approximately 6,000 fire hydrants.

===Police===
From 1818 to 1847, law enforcement was administered by the Warrick County sheriff, and from 1847 to 1863, the city marshal shared policing duties with the police department. In 1863, the Evansville Police Department was founded.

===Film and television===
Game scenes in the 1992 film &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; were filmed at Bosse Field. It is the third oldest baseball stadium still in use in the United States (behind Fenway Park in Boston and Wrigley Field in Chicago). The ballpark served as the homefield for the Racine Belles. Scenes from the 2014 Michael Rosenbaum movie &quot;Back in the Day&quot; feature Green River Road in Evansville.

All exterior shots on the 1988–2018 sitcom &quot;Roseanne&quot; are still photographs taken in and around Evansville. The Conners&#x27; house is at 619 South Runnymeade Avenue, and the Lobo Lounge is a pizzeria at the corner of Edgar and Louisiana Streets. Matt Williams, one of the show&#x27;s producers, is a native of Evansville and a graduate of The University of Evansville theatre program. He is a co-founder of Wind Dancer Productions and has been involved with numerous sitcoms such as &#x27;Home Improvement&#x27;, movies and dramatic plays for Broadway.

&quot;The Daily Show&quot; has featured Evansville in two episodes. The first featured a story about comedian Carrot Top&#x27;s reopening of the historic Victory Theatre. The second poked fun at former mayor Russell Lloyd Jr. for skipping out on a city meeting to attend Cher&#x27;s Farewell Tour concert being performed on the same night at Roberts Stadium.

Evansville was also featured in Alton Brown&#x27;s series &quot;Feasting on Asphalt&quot;. Alton and his crew visited the historic Greyhound Bus station for its vending machines, the YWCA tea room for lunch, and the Hilltop Inn for a brain sandwich and burgoo. Other shows have included &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; which investigated Willard Library&#x27;s &quot;Gray Lady&quot; ghost and &quot;Storm Stories&quot; on The Weather Channel documenting the devastating tornado that struck the city in 2005. The city was briefly featured in the 2007 &quot;Prison Break&quot; episode &quot;Chicago&quot;. In 2012, Evansville was featured on the British television program &quot;Supersize vs Superskinny&quot; because of a poll that ranked the residents of the city as the most obese in the United States.

Evansville and neighboring Newburgh was the featured location for the feature film &quot;Back in the Day&quot; filmed in 2014.

Evansville is mentioned several times in the third and fourth seasons of the HBO series &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;.

In 2021, an episode of HBO&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;re Here&quot; was filmed in Evansville.

===Literary media===
Evansville is featured in a section of Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s 1955 novel &quot;Lolita&quot;, as well as Walker Percy&#x27;s 1962 novel &quot;The Moviegoer&quot;, and Robert Silverberg&#x27;s 1969 science fiction novel &quot;To Live Again&quot;.

Evansville is the primary location in the historical fiction novel, &quot;Invitation to Valhalla&quot; by Mike Whicker, published in 2004. The novel is based on the records of German spy Erika Lehmann&#x27;s attempt to infiltrate the LST shipyards during WWII.

An Evansville couple is the focus of &quot;Hungarian Rhapsody: An Adoption Story&quot; by James Derk, based on a series of stories in the &quot;Evansville Courier &amp; Press&quot;.

Evansville, under the name Vansul, appears as a slapstick satire in the post-apocalyptic novel &quot;Light of the Ancient Sun&quot;.

Evansville is the hometown of the protagonist, Jack Crabb, in Thomas Berger&#x27;s 1964 book &quot;Little Big Man&quot;. This is not mentioned in the 1970 cinematic adaption, &quot;Little Big Man&quot;.

==Sister cities==
Evansville has three sister cities, as designated by Sister Cities International, Inc. (SCI):

<text>Melody Hill is a census-designated place (CDP) in Center Township, Vanderburgh County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 3,628 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and 0.73% is water. The Census Bureau-created CDP of &quot;Melody Hill&quot; consists of the residential areas south of the Evansville Regional Airport, north of Lynch Road, west of Green River Road, and east of the industrial area that includes Whirlpool (the industrial plants are not included as they are in the Evansville city limits.). Melody Hill includes older subdivisions such as Melody Hills, Cloverlawn Estates, Ridgeview Estates, and the Bergdolt Rd. area, as well as several newer subdivisions.

==School Districts==
This area, originally part of the Vanderburgh County School Corporation, was served beginning in the mid 1870s by Center Township School #7 (Hooker School, at Oak Hill and Whetstone Rds.) and Center Township School #4 (originally at Oak Hill and Bergdolt Rds, then moved to Oak Hill and Lynch Rds. and named &quot;Lynch School&quot;). In 1918, Hooker School, along with two other schools, was consolidated into McCutchanville School and closed, while Lynch School continued to serve a small part of the district. In 1944, a local resident remembered walking six miles each way as a child between McCutchanville School and his home on what is now Hitch-Peters Rd. From 1948 to 1957, Lynch and McCutchanville Schools were combined into one district, with students in grades 1 and 2 attending Lynch and grades 3 to 8 attending McCutchanville. The new Oak Hill School was opened in 1957 for grades 1 to 5, with grades 6 to 8 attending McCutchanville School (Lynch School was re-purposed for disabled students). The Oak Hill School 1966 upper grades addition opened the school to all students in grades K to 8, and McCutchanville School was closed.

From 1966 to 1984, all students north of Lynch Road and west of the Vanderburgh/Warrick county line, in an area extending halfway into McCutchanville to the north, attended Oak Hill Elementary School (K-8) and North High School. This included the entirety of current-day &quot;Melody Hill.&quot; With the 1984 EVSC middle school redistricting plan, Melody Hill was split along St. George Rd. between two elementary districts (Vogel and Scott) for grades K-5, with older grades attending Oak Hill Middle School and North High School. In 2011, following the construction of the new North High School (gr. 9-12) and North Junior High School (gr. 7-8), Oak Hill again became an elementary school (gr. K-6), but students south of St. George Rd. continued at Vogel Elementary (K-6).

In response to explosive population growth in the area, which was straining resources at Scott and Oak Hill schools, a new McCutchanville school (gr. K-6) was opened in 2018.

==&quot;Melody Hills&quot; Subdivisions==

To residents, &quot;Melody Hills&quot; (note the &quot;s&quot;) consists only of the two neighborhoods off St. George Road between U.S. Route 41 and Oak Hill Road. The older section, south of St. George Rd., consists of smaller tract homes built in the postwar era to house workers at the Whirlpool plant. The newer section, consisting of larger homes built on a hilly area in the 1960s, is on the north side of St. George Road between Ward Road on the east and Twickingham Road on the west. It is south of the Evansville Regional Airport and east of the Sunset Memorial Gardens cemetery. To its east is the &quot;Knob Hill&quot; area, one street of homes around a lake and small hill.

When the town was laid out on September 20, 1827, it was called Eugene Station, though it was also called Osonimon after an Indian chief of that name.

The name is based on the Iroquois term &quot;Gwa-u-geh&quot;, meaning &quot;the place of taking out&quot; (in terms of a portage). Local legend attributes the name to the sound made by the horn of a Ford Model T. The town was incorporated around 1891.

<text>Clinton is a city in Clinton Township, Vermillion County, Indiana, United States. The population was 4,893 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The city was established in 1829 and is named for DeWitt Clinton, governor of New York from 1817 to 1823. Many of Clinton&#x27;s original settlers were immigrants working in coal mines, many from Italy. According to Vermillion County naturalization records, &quot;...from 1856 to 1952... Vermillion County received almost 3,550 new citizens of foreign birth, the largest number coming during the first twelve years of [the 20th] century. Italians accounted for one-third, or 1,178, of the total number who filed Declarations, with Austrians the next largest group (675) and then Scots. At least 77 percent of the Italians were from the northern regions of Italy.&quot; This was in contrast to the majority of Italian immigrants to America during this same time period that hailed from southern Italy. Over time, the coal mining industry in Clinton ended but many of the Italian settlers stayed at Clinton.

The Clinton post office has been in operation since 1823.

The Clinton Paving and Building Brick Company was established in 1893, at which time it was producing 40,000 bricks per day.

<text>Perrysville is a town in Highland Township, Vermillion County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 456 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Perrysville was platted and surveyed in 1825 by James Blair on a bluff on the west side of the Wabash River. The town is named for Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, the hero of the Battle of Lake Erie. It became a local center for shipping products to New Orleans on flatboats via the Wabash, Ohio, and Mississippi Rivers, and it was also able to receive heavy equipment and manufactured items on steamboats. Prior to the advent of the railroad in the second half of the nineteenth century, the town&#x27;s location on the river made for a thriving community; it is reputed to have been the largest town between Chicago and Terre Haute at the height of its success. The arrival of the Wabash and Erie Canal enhanced its importance even further; a sidecut with locks allowed boats to be towed across the river to the town. Various roads intersected here, including a plank toll road from Danville, Illinois to the west, and stagecoach traffic became frequent. However, when the railroads did arrive, and failed to pass through the town, it spelled the eventual end of the vital river traffic, and of the importance of the town of Perrysville.

The Perrysville post office has been in operation since 1827.

==Geography==
Perrysville is located in the northeast part of the county on the western banks of the Wabash River. Indiana State Road 32 passes through the town.

In 1984, he was a presenter at the Grammys, handing the award for Best Recording for Children to Michael Jackson for his album &quot;E.T. the Extra Terrestrial&quot;

In 2014, Roselló said that he was sexually abused by his producer Edgardo Díaz, and In 2023, he stated that José Menéndez raped him when he was 14.

==Early life==
In his youth, Roy was a player for the Puerto Rican National Children&#x27;s Soccer Team.

Roselló was a member of Menudo from August 1983 to January 1986 and debuted on the album &quot;A Todo Rock&quot;, albeit he didn&#x27;t have lead vocals from the album, including &quot;Reaching Out&quot; and &quot;Mania&quot;. He recorded a total of six albums with the group, with the second half of the albums he was in, he had lead vocals on one song per each album. During his time, Menudo reached great popularity in Asia, more specifically in the Philippines and Japan. They had hits like &quot;Indianápolis&quot; and &quot;Like A Cannonball,&quot; which was featured in the film &quot;Cannonball Run 2&quot;. It was also during his tenure in the Menudo lineup that the group scored their biggest hit in the United States, &quot;Hold Me.&quot; Roy sang lead in the second version of &quot;Ladron De Amor&quot; and is seen prominently in the music video. He also sang lead in the song, &quot;No Hay Reflexion&quot; from the Grammy nominated album Evolucion.

==Personal life==

In 1986, Roy met Brazilian children’s TV host Mara Maravilha and they started dating. Mara got pregnant by Roy, but her mother made her get an abortion in 1987. At the time the couple lived together for two years in a house he had in New York, USA. Their relationship ended in 1988, allegedly due to the excessive jealousy of Mara and her distrust of Roy. Mara stated in interviews that he wanted her to stop singing. At the time she was aware of the sexual abuse he allegedly suffered during his years in Menudo.

Rosselló is the father of five children with five different women, including eldest son Roy Jr. with his first wife Mireya Nieves, whom he married on October 14, 1989. The marriage was concluded by a divorce decree issued on December 10, 1993.
Following this he was married to his second wife Brenda Colon Reyes for a year and a half. He also has another son named Enrico with his third wife, Mirella Rodriguez Marcolini (m. 2008-2010), and a daughter Sophia, born in 2009, who was the result of a 6 month relationship he had with Natália Borges, a former employee of a store he had in Campinas.

In 2003, Roy went to Campinas after he had to acknowledge the paternity of his eldest child, Bianca, when he appeared on a TV program in Brazil. She was born when Roy was 15 years old. The girl is a result of his fling with a teenage Brazilian fan when he was on tour with Menudo there in 1985.
In addition to Roy Jr., Enrico, Sophia and Bianca, he is also father to a third son named Guilhermo. 
In a 2014 interview, Roy said he should have preserved himself more in relation to women. “I always liked women, but I should have been more careful,’ he regrets. The musician stated that he believes women approached him because of money. “Because I was a famous guy, they think I have money, but it’s all an illusion. For them it’s not important to allow me to have a good relationship with my children, they just want money,” he said.

In 1994, Roy married Marta Rhaulin. He made for 11 years a musical duo with her, Duo Roy and Rhaulin.

Roy married Patricia Avila in 2014, they have since divorced in 2018.

===Post Menudo===

He spent 1987 touring the United States, starred in a movie called Star of the Jungle, and was the host of Frente Jovem in 1986, a Brazilian TV show.

In 1991, Roy Rossello studied TV production at the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale in Florida.

Since 2006, Rosselló has run a Caribbean-themed bar in the city of Campinas, located in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, where he also owns a jewelry store, Roy Rosello Fine Jewelry.

More recently, through another TV show in Brazil, he met his long-lost daughter and decided to settle in the South American country. Roy fell in love with the people, the culture, the tropical weather and the hospitality he found in Brazil, his new home.

===Return to music===
In 2009, Roy entered into the Brazilian music scene, when he formed a band of axé and Caribbean music.

===&quot;A Fazenda&quot;===

On September 14, 2014, Roy joined as a contestant on the famous Brazilian reality show &quot;A Fazenda 7&quot; on TV Record.

On October 21, 2014, Rosselló alleged on the show that he and Ricky Martin had been victims of sexual abuse from Edgardo Diaz while Rosselló and Martin were members of Menudo.

== Sexual assault allegations ==

On April 18, 2023, on a segment of the &quot;Today Show&quot; about an upcoming docuseries, Roy alleged that he had been raped by José Enrique Menendez, the father of Lyle and Erik Menendez. Roy stated that when he was visiting their New Jersey home at the age of 14, José drugged and raped him. &quot;That&#x27;s the man here that raped me&quot;, [Roy] says in a clip of the docuseries, pointing to Menendez in a photo. &quot;That&#x27;s the pedophile.&quot;

Rosselló also accused his former producer Edgardo Díaz of sexually abusing him in October 2014.

<text>West Terre Haute is a town in Sugar Creek Township, Vigo County, Indiana, on the western side of the Wabash River near Terre Haute. The population was 2,236 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Terre Haute Metropolitan Statistical Area. Bethany Congregational Church was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

==History==
Originally called McQuilkinsville, then simply Macksville or Maxville, West Terre Haute was laid out by Samuel McQuilkin on November 22, 1836. The first building had been put up in 1833, and in 1834 McQuilkin opened a general store on the National Road between present-day Third and Fourth Streets. The store proved useful to those working on the National Road and made McQuilkinsville an important town in the area. Because of the town&#x27;s fertile soil, soon people started settling there as vegetable farmers. John Griggs and his son Edward put up a flour mill in 1867, but the structure was burned in 1870. The town expanded quickly, with Smith Hinch building a tavern on the National Road and Richard McIlroy building a brick general store and post office in 1872.

In 1894 citizens of the town voted to change its name to West Terre Haute.

The West Terre Haute post office has been in operation since 1899.

Bethany Congregational Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

===Growth of industry===

By 1878, industries included a lumber mill, a cigar factory, and a shingle manufacturer, and the town had grown to a population of 250.

With coal-bearing bluffs immediately to the town&#x27;s north and west, coal mining became a major industry in the town. By 1906, West Terre Haute had eleven mines in operation, served by both railroads and wagon roads. These mines averaged a daily output of 2,000 tons.

Clay deposits in the town led to the production of clay products including building brick, paving brick, sewer pipe and drain tile. Four separate companies in the area worked in this industry, including the Vigo Clay Company, the Miller Brick Company, Terre Haute Brick and Pipe Company (also known as the Vitrified Brick Company), and the National Drain Tile Company.

Just north of West Terre Haute was a large gravel pit a mile in length at its widest point. The gravel was mainly used in railroad grades.

Due to increased employment opportunities, the population of West Terre Haute increased from several hundred in the 1880s to approximately 3500 by the mid-1890s. To accommodate these new residents and commuters, in 1905 a new bridge was built to cross the Wabash River including tracks for the city&#x27;s streetcar and interurban line. The Bank of West Terre Haute was established that same year.

===Decline of commerce===

Beginning in the early 1920s, the coal, clay and gravel industries slowly declined. West Terre Haute became a mainly residential community for factory workers and miners. After the Great Depression, the town&#x27;s businesses included automobile repair shops and grocers. However, business faded when I-70 was constructed and circumvented the town.

<doc id="112658" wikidata="Q219559" url="?curid=112658" title="Ecchi">
<text>is a slang term in the Japanese language for playfully sexual actions. As an adjective, it is used with the meaning of &quot;sexy&quot;, &quot;dirty&quot; or &quot;naughty&quot;; as a verb, means &quot;to have sex&quot;, and as a noun, it is used to describe someone of lascivious behavior. It is softer than the Japanese word &quot;&quot; ( from &quot;Eros&quot; or &quot;erotic&quot;), and does not imply perversion in the way &quot;hentai&quot; does.

The word &quot;ecchi&quot; has been adopted by western fans of Japanese media to describe works with sexual overtones. In western culture, it has come to be used to refer to softcore or playful sexuality, as distinct from the word &quot;hentai&quot;, which connotes perversion or fetishism. Works described as ecchi by the western fans do not show sexual intercourse or genitalia, but sexual themes are referenced. &quot;Ecchi&quot; themes are a type of fan service, and can be found in most comedy shōnen and seinen manga and harem anime.

== Etymology and use in Japan ==
The correct transcription of the word in Hepburn notation is &quot;&quot;. However, it is typically written as &quot;ecchi&quot; in the Western world.

&quot;Etchi&quot; in and of itself is merely an abbreviation of &quot;hentai&quot;. There is no distinction between &quot;hardcore&quot; &quot;hentai&quot; and &quot;softcore&quot; &quot;etchi&quot; in proper Japanese. See Hentai#Etymology for further etymology.

&#x27; was introduced in the Meiji period as a term for &quot;change of form&quot; or &quot;transformation&quot; in science and psychology. In this context, it was used to refer to disorders such as hysteria or to describe paranormal phenomena like hypnosis or telepathy. Slowly, the meaning expanded until it had the meaning of &quot;non-standard&quot;. In the 1910s, it was used in sexology in the compound expression &quot;&quot; (, &quot;abnormal sexual desire&quot;, which is rephrased as &quot;sexual perversion&quot; in modern times) and became popular within the theory of sexual deviance (&#x27;), published by Eiji Habuto and Jun&#x27;ichirō Sawada in 1915. In the 1920s, many publications dealt with deviant sexual desires and the movement. Goichi Matsuzawa calls it a period characterized by a &quot;hentai boom&quot;. In the 1930s, censorship became more common, leading to fewer books being published on this theme.

After the Second World War, in the 1950s, interest in hentai was renewed, and people would sometimes refer to it just by the first English letter, &quot;H&quot; (pronounced as , ). In 1952, the magazine &quot;Shukan Asahi&quot; reported that a woman who was groped by a stranger in a movie theater reacted with &quot;&quot; (&quot;hey, that&#x27;s perverse&quot;). In this context, &#x27; should be understood as &quot;sexually forward&quot; and is synonymous to &#x27; (, dirty or disgusting) or &#x27; (, a person with sex on the brain). From this, the word &#x27; started to branch off, and assume new connotations. In the 1960s, &#x27; started to be used by youth to refer to sex in general. By the 1980s, it was used to mean &quot;sex&quot;, as in the phrase &#x27; (to have sex).

Other neologisms such as &quot;&quot; are often used to refer to sex, in addition to the term &quot;ecchi.&quot; &quot;Ecchi&quot; is now used as a qualifier for anything related to erotic or pornographic content. Its exact meaning varies with context, but in general, it is most similar to the English word &quot;naughty&quot; (when used as an adjective). The Japanese media tend to use other words, e.g. &quot;ero-manga&quot; (), &quot;adult manga&quot; (), or anime / manga for persons over 18 years (, ). The prefix &quot;H-&quot; is also sometimes used to refer to pornographic genres, e.g. H-anime, H-manga, etc.

== Western usage ==
In Japan, oiroke manga (お色気漫画) is used to describe manga with very light or playful erotic content, such as is found in shonen manga. In western nations, though, &quot;ecchi&quot; has become the preferred term. The more explicit manga (, &#x27;) are more likely to be referred to as hentai in the west. This does correlate to a similar distinction in Japanese. For instance, if a young woman were to call a young man &#x27;, that might be construed as flirting, whereas &quot;&quot; sounds more like condemnation.

Works aimed at a female audience can contain scenes which are seen as ecchi. Examples are &quot;R-18 Love Report!&quot; from Emiko Sugi and &quot;&quot; from Risa Itō, which are aimed at the and josei audience, but contain rather explicit content.

Common elements of ecchi include conversations with sexual references or misunderstandings (e.g. double entendre or innuendo), misunderstandings in visual depictions (e.g. suggestive posing), revealing or sexualized clothing (e.g. underwear or cosplay), nudity (e.g. ripped apart clothing, wet clothing, clothing malfunctions) and the portrayal of certain actions (e.g. groping). This kind of sexuality is often used for comical effect. A typical example scene would contain a male protagonist that trips over a female character, giving the impression of sexual harassment.

The concept of ecchi is very closely related to fan service. While fan service describes every aspect to please the fans, ecchi relates to sexual themes. A special kind of fan service, that is usually bound or justified by the narrative.

=== Typical examples ===
There are many elements that may classify a work as ecchi, but these elements have to occur quite often (for example, in all episodes of a show). Graphically speaking, different techniques are used to show sexy pictures, usually by revealing parts of the female body such as the back or breasts. Some of these patterns are recurrent, such as scenes in a shower, hot springs (&quot;onsen&quot;), or fighting scenes in which clothes are torn apart. The imagination of characters is also a common device for showing their sexual fantasies, as well as transformation scenes of magical girls. In the end, any excuse is valid to show a character partially or completely nude.

==== Nudity ====
Levels of nudity vary strongly between works, depending on the intended audience and the preferences of the authors. For example, in some cases, though the breasts are shown on the screen, nipples and genitals are obscured by props, clothing, or effects. This kind of censorship was typical for Lala Satalin Deviluke in &quot;To Love Ru&quot;, Blair in &quot;Soul Eater&quot; and Asuka Langley Soryu from &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;. Conversely, in &quot;Ladies versus Butlers!&quot; and other such anime, the nipples are clearly visible through clothing, no matter how thick it is. In any case nosebleeds as a comedic trope are a typical masculine reaction to female nudity or semi-nudity inasmuch as they represent one extremely exaggerated component of sexual arousal – increased blood pressure.

==== Panties ====

The use of panty shots &quot;(panchira)&quot;, or visibility of the underwear (panties), is one common motif. Typically the male character will react in an exaggerated manner and be castigated. Furthermore the color and style of the panties are an indication of the character, personality, and range sexual experience (or lack of it) female character, e.g. white for the innocent, striped for the shy, and red for the experienced. Panties are the main theme in some ecchi (for instance, &quot;Chobits&quot; and &quot;Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt&quot;), but they can also appear in other anime simply for a bit of gratuitous sex appeal.

==== Sexual activity ====
Although revealing or sexualized clothing, nudity or groping may occur in ecchi works, there usually is no explicit sexual intercourse in such works (although in the West they may be erroneously classified as hentai). Furthermore in this genre may appear that whilst it appears that a couple &quot;are&quot; having sex. E.g. the two may be seen in silhouette from outside a tent, or making sounds during exertion.

<text>Wabash is a city in Noble Township, Wabash County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 10,666 at the 2010 census. The city is situated along the Wabash River in the county seat of Wabash County.

Wabash is notable as claiming to be the first electrically lighted city in the world, which was inaugurated on March 31, 1880. However, closer inspection of the reference shows only the court house grounds were lighted. It is also home to the historic Eagles Theatre, Paradise Spring Treaty Grounds (1826), the Wabash and Erie Canal, Presbyterian Church (1880), and Disciples of Christ Christian Church (1865).

== Etymology ==
The name Wabash derives from a Miami-Illinois term for &quot;water over white stones.&quot; The Miami name reflected the clarity of the river in Huntington County, Indiana, where the river bottom is limestone.

==History==
The first settlers to arrive in Wabash was in 1829 as a result of the treaty of Paradise Spring. The town of Wabash was platted in the spring of 1834 by Col. Hugh Hanna and Col. David Burr. The community was designated as the county seat, and it was incorporated in 1834. The town prospered due to its proximity to the Wabash and Erie Canal. In 1870 the Wabash County Courthouse and most of downtown was destroyed in a fire. However, the resilience of the city led Wabash to recover. The construction of the Big Four Railway brought even more growth to the small town but led to the neglect of the canal.

Wabash used a new type of carbon arc light invented by Charles Brush in 1870. On March 31, 1880, four 3,000-candle power lamps were suspended from the top of the courthouse. Two telegraph wires ran from the lamps to the courthouse basement, where they were connected to a generator powered by a 12-horsepower steam engine to provide power 

The James M. Amoss Building, Downtown Wabash Historic District, East Wabash Historic District, First Christian Church, Honeywell Memorial Community Center, Honeywell Studio, McNamee-Ford House, North Wabash Historic District, West Wabash Historic District, and Solomon Wilson Building are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Pine Village is a town in Adams Township, Warren County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 217 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The town was founded at the location of a trading post called Pine Village, which may have been named for a lone pine tree that stood on the bluff of Pine Creek, or it may have been named for the creek itself. The town was laid out in 1851 by Isaac and John R. Metsker, and the plat map was made by county surveyor Perrin Kent. The Methodist Church was already there; it was built several years earlier.

The post office at Pine Village has been in operation since 1854.

===Rail service===
Rail service reached the town in the 1870s. The year 1883 witnessed the completion of a north/south Chicago and Great Southern Railway (later the Chicago and Indiana Coal Railway) line between Attica and Fair Oaks, some to the north. The line was later part of the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad. It came to be known as the &quot;Coal Road&quot; for the large quantities of coal transported along it. When the C&amp;EI floundered in the early 1920s, Charles F. Propst purchased the Coal Road and in October 1922 incorporated it as the Chicago, Attica and Southern Railroad. The CA&amp;S was placed in receivership on August 5, 1931, and incremental abandonment occurred over subsequent years. The line through Pine Village was scrapped in the fall of 1945, and the rails were pulled up using a Belgian horse and a block and tackle.

===Professional football===
During the mid-1910s, Pine Village hosted a prominent professional football team.

<text>State Line City is a town in Kent Township, Warren County, Indiana, United States, situated along the state&#x27;s boundary with Illinois. As of the 2010 census, the town population was 143.

==History==

In the mid-1850s, two large railway lines converged on the Indiana-Illinois state line – the narrow-gauge Toledo, Wabash and Western Railway (later the Wabash Railroad), whose route from the east crossed Warren County and reached the state line in October 1856, and the standard-gauge Great Western Railroad, which shortly thereafter reached the state line from the west. State Line City was platted on June 29, 1857, by Robert Casement at the convergence of these two railroads. The city flourished, and within 10 years had reached a population of approximately 550, but because of the drinking and carousing of the numerous railroaders it gained an unsavory reputation.

On February 11, 1861, Abraham Lincoln stopped in State Line on his way from Springfield, Illinois, to Washington, D.C., for his inauguration. He dined at the Frazier Eating House, then gave a short speech to a crowd in the public square before resuming his journey. A historical marker on the site commemorates the event, and records the words which Lincoln spoke:

The town&#x27;s post office was established in July 1857, with Robert Casement as the first postmaster, and continues to operate today from a newer building on Woodard Street. Grain elevators were erected in the fall of 1857, but fires in September 1900, December 1932 and June 1984 each completely destroyed the structures, which were subsequently rebuilt. State Line&#x27;s grain elevators are currently operated by Archer Daniels Midland of Decatur, Illinois, and see considerable activity during harvest time. The town&#x27;s other large business is a fertilizer and agricultural sales facility northeast of town, built in 1975 and currently operated by Westland Co-Op.
Other establishments in State Line include the Kent Township Fire Department, formed in 1978, which took over local fire protection responsibilities from the West Lebanon Fire Department; in 2000, however, the department merged back with West Lebanon, which now maintains the State Line fire station. The KTFD sponsored for a number of years an annual town festival called the State Line Fun Days, but this is no longer held.

As of 2007, State Line has one active church: the State Line Christian Church, built in 1868. Rev. Gerald Burt has been the pastor there since 1972. The Church of the Nazarene (built around 1860 as a Presbyterian church and purchased for use as a Nazarene church in 1929) and the Methodist Church (built in 1863-4) were both disbanded due to low attendance in the 1990s and have since been turned into homes. Rev. Jim Kessler was the last pastor at the Nazarene church.

==Geography==

State Line City is located in the southwestern part of the county in open farm land along the border with Illinois, five miles northeast of the city of Danville, Illinois.
According to the 2010 census, State Line City has a total area of , all land.
The Norfolk Southern Railway runs southwest through town. For many years the famous Wabash Cannonball ran on the line (then owned by the Wabash Railway), passing through town twice a day on its route from St. Louis to Detroit and back. The Wabash Railway merged in the mid-1960s with the Norfolk and Western Railway, which in turn merged with Southern Railway in the 1980s to become Norfolk Southern, officially bringing an end to the Wabash name.

The section of the community west of the state line is Illiana.

<text>West Lebanon is a town in Pike Township, Warren County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 723 at the 2010 census.

==History==

West Lebanon was laid out and platted in the fall of 1830 by Ebenezer Purviance, John G. Jemison and Andrew Fleming, and consisted of 64 lots. Originally named Lebanon, the name was changed to West Lebanon in 1869 when the town was incorporated, possibly in deference to the Boone County community of the same name which established its post office on December 15, 1832, just eleven days before their own.

Not being close to any waterways, West Lebanon&#x27;s early growth was relatively slow and for many years had no more than 20 families. However, with the completion of the Wabash Railroad line one mile north of town in 1856, the community&#x27;s fortunes improved and led to most of the town relocating closer to the station. The original settlement area became known as Old Town.

A Carnegie library was built at the corner of High Street and North Street in 1916 and continues to operate as the West Lebanon-Pike Township Public Library.

Fire destroyed part of West Lebanon&#x27;s business district the evening of January 26, 2011, destroying a row of buildings along the west side of High Street between First and North streets.

==Geography==

West Lebanon is located just south of State Road 28 about east of the Illinois border and about west of Williamsport. State Road 263 is concurrent with High Street and intersects State Road 28 at the north edge of town. A line of the Norfolk Southern Railway also passes through the north edge of the town. Rock Creek, east of town, flows south toward the Wabash River and forms the township&#x27;s eastern border; it is fed by the small Johnson Branch which crosses the north edge of town.

According to the 2010 census, West Lebanon has a total area of , all land.

In terms of ancestry, 19.8% were German, 8.4% were Irish, and 6.6% were American.

Of the 287 households, 34.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 46.3% were married couples living together, 13.2% had a female householder with no husband present, 33.1% were non-families, and 25.8% of all households were made up of individuals. The average household size was 2.52 and the average family size was 2.98. The median age was 37.4 years.

The median income for a household was $49,226 and the median income for a family was $53,708. Males had a median income of $42,500 versus $34,063 for females. The per capita income for was $19,388.

<text>Williamsport is a town in Washington Township, Warren County, Indiana, United States. The population was 1,898 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Warren County and is the largest of the four incorporated towns in the county. Williamsport Falls is located in downtown Williamsport.

==History==
Williamsport was platted by (and named for) William Harrison on December 11, 1828, on the south end of the eastern fractional part of the northeast quarter of section 11, township 21, range 8. Harrison was the first to occupy the town in the fall of 1828; he built a log house at the east end of Main Street near the river and operated a ferry crossing there for several years. Though located on the opposite side of the river from the Wabash and Erie Canal, Williamsport sought to draw shipping traffic by constructing a short cut-off canal. Finished around 1852, the project led to the nickname &quot;Side-Cut City&quot;.

Williamsport became the county seat in June 1829, taking the title away from short-lived Warrenton. Its post office was the first in the county and has operated since September 28, 1829. The town was incorporated in March 1854, at which time its population was 552.

The post office at Williamsport has been in operation since 1829.

James Frank Hanly, who was the Governor of Indiana from 1905 to 1909, lived and practiced law here from 1879 to 1896; he is buried at Hillside Cemetery, on the northeast side of town.

The Williamsport-Washington Township Public Library opened in 1917 as a Carnegie library, and moved to a new facility in 2002.

===Historic places===
The Williamsport Presbyterian Church at 15 Fall Street, built in 1889, appears on the Indiana Register of Historic Sites and Structures. It was closed in 1964 and stood vacant until 1991, when a non-profit corporation was set up to support the restoration effort. It was listed in 1998 after having received a new slate roof and other repairs. The building contains the original stained glass windows, bell, pulpit, and pews.

The &quot;Tower House&quot; can be found at 303 Lincoln Street and was constructed in 1854. The house was nicknamed due to its three-story tower on the northeast corner of the building. The house was originally constructed as a mirrored twin; the twin house was destroyed by a fire in the 1990s. The house has changed from its original construction. An enclosed front porch and side porch has been retooled to serve as the current family&#x27;s kitchen area. The house originally contained two large rooms upstairs, and three rooms downstairs. What appears to be the summer kitchen and original carriage house still stand. The house now has five bedrooms, one bath upstairs and seven rooms, an enclosed porch, and a bath downstairs. They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 as the Kent and Hitchens Houses.

The Warren County Courthouse at 125 North Monroe Street was built in 1907-1908 and is on the United States National Register of Historic Places. It is the fourth purpose-built court house in the county&#x27;s history.

<doc id="112667" wikidata="Q3292351" url="?curid=112667" title="Chandler, Indiana">
<text>Chandler is a town straddling Ohio and Boon Township in Warrick County, Indiana, United States, located just east of Evansville, Indiana along the Ohio River. The population was 3,693 at the 2020 census, making it Warrick County&#x27;s second-most populous municipality after Boonville. The town is part of the Evansville metropolitan area with a population of 342,815.

==History==
In 1847, the area which is now Chandler opened a post office named Lee to serve its residents. By that time, a portion of the Central Canal (a piece of the Wabash and Erie Canal) was completed just outside of town that connected nearby Evansville with present-day Worthington. The canal system was never fully completed, having met its doom with financial problems and competition from the railroad boom, but part of the canal remains today along with the old tow path, aptly named Tow Path Road.

In 1874, Lee officially became Chandler. The town got its new moniker from O.E. Chandler, the foreman of the Lake Erie, Evansville &amp; South Western Railroad, which had completed construction on a new railway through town the year before. Using the creek bed from the failed Wabash and Erie Canal, L E E &amp; S W RR created a rail line from Evansville through Chandler and on to Gentryville. Although the line is no longer used for passenger travel, Norfolk Southern still operates cargo trains on a portion of the railway that follows the Central Canal. The former Chandler Depot also remains, although it now serves as a private residence.

In 1875, the first underground coal mine in town opened, Chandler Mine. Warrick County lies on the eastern edge of the Illinois Basin, making it a vast coal resource; once the use of coal became mainstreamed for locomotives (and later, for generating electricity), companies flocked to the area to begin mining operations. Chandler was no different, with six different underground mines having operated here at various times over nearly a century. No more than three underground mines operated at any one time in Chandler; the Erie Canal/Air Line Mine had the longest history, having operated for 40 years before shutting down in 1937.

By the mid-1940s, all but one mine had shut down. This allowed for above-ground development, and the construction business boomed. Within a five-year period, houses sprung up like mushrooms and the population more than doubled.

In 1953, the town became incorporated, and three trustees and a clerk-treasurer were elected to lead the citizens of Chandler. For the next two decades, town officials and residents worked to organize and equip a volunteer fire department, improve streets and install street lights, construct water wells and a water treatment plant, complete a sewer treatment plant and system, and purchase a building to house town offices. More recently, residential, commercial, and industrial development has remained slow and steady.

==Geography==

In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level circuit court.

Chandler is represented by Vaneta Becker (District 50) in the Indiana State Senate. The town is located in the 8th District of Indiana (map) and served by U.S. Representative Larry Bucshon, a resident of Newburgh.

<text>Newburgh is an incorporated town in Ohio Township, Warrick County, Indiana, United States, along the Ohio River. The population was 3,325 as of the 2010 census, although the town is part of the larger Evansville metropolitan area, which recorded a population of 342,815, and Ohio Township, which Newburgh shares with nearby Chandler, has a population of 37,749 according to the 2010 census with over 17,000 of those living in the town and adjacent areas. It is the easternmost suburb of Evansville.

The area has been inhabited by various cultures, dating back at least 10,000 years. Angel Mounds was a permanent settlement of the Mississippian culture from 1000 AD to around 1400 AD. By 1850, Newburgh was one of the larger riverports between Cincinnati and New Orleans, and was the first town north of the Mason–Dixon line to be captured by Confederate forces during the Newburgh Raid during the American Civil War. Shortly after the mid-nineteenth century, Newburgh&#x27;s growth leveled off until the economic boom of the 1960s and 1970s, resulting in substantial growth as a bedroom community for families looking for new housing developments near Evansville.

Today, Newburgh is locally known for its historic downtown district that features a number of specialty stores, antique shops, and restaurants along its riverfront. The town remains a popular residential community for people working in or near Evansville.

As a town situated on the fertile banks of the Ohio River, Newburgh has a long history of human activity. Western explorers first arrived in the area in the 17th century. For centuries prior to that, it had been inhabited by the Shawnee people and was near the center of prehistoric Mississippian culture as late as 1450 A.D. Evidence of this prehistoric society remains today at Angel Mounds, a National Historic Landmark, and Ellerbusch site, both approximately two miles west of Newburgh.

The principal founders of Newburgh are John Sprinkle and Abner Luce. Sprinkle, a businessman of German descent, landed in Newburgh in the spring of 1803, thirteen years before Indiana entered the Union as the 19th state. He secured land grants in 1812 and in 1818 platted what became known as Sprinklesburgh (sometimes called &quot;Mount Pleasant&quot;). It was the first town in Warrick County. The original plat of Sprinklesburgh consisted of about 12 blocks immediately west of today&#x27;s downtown Newburgh.

Abner Luce founded Newburgh almost directly to the east of Sprinklesburgh in 1829. In 1841, Luce&#x27;s plat was merged with Sprinkelsburgh and the name of the town was changed to Newburgh. However, it was Samuel Short&#x27;s land, a strip on the block west of State Street, that now has some of the most visible and important land in modern downtown Newburgh.

By 1850, the town had grown to be one of the largest riverports on the Ohio-Mississippi River between Cincinnati and New Orleans. Much of its growth in this time period was due to coal mining and its beneficial location on the Ohio River. The first underground mine shaft in Indiana was sunk in Newburgh in 1850. However, when the national railway system came to southern Indiana, it bypassed Newburgh completely in favor of Evansville, beginning a permanent shift in regional economic dominance.

According to a number of historical sources, Newburgh was a prominent stop on the Underground Railroad between the mouth of the 
Little Pigeon River and Lake Michigan. On July 18, 1862, Newburgh was the first town north of the Mason-Dixon line to be captured by the Confederate forces during the American Civil War in what would come to be known as the Newburgh Raid. Colonel Adam &quot;Stovepipe&quot; Johnson, with a partisan band, crossed the Ohio River and confiscated supplies and ammunition without a shot being fired. The Confederates would have been unable to shell the city (as promised) had Newburgh put up a fight. The Confederates&#x27; cannons were an assemblage of a stove pipe, charred log, and wagon wheels. The raid convinced the federal government that it was necessary to supply Indiana with a permanent force of regular Union Army soldiers to counter future raids. Many of the structures used in this raid are still standing, including the Exchange Hotel.

Newburgh&#x27;s economy benefited from the construction of the Lock and Dam 47 in the 1920s, and its replacement in 1974 with the Newburgh Lock and Dam. The town also benefited from the arrival, and later expansions, of the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA), built in 1957. Many of Newburgh&#x27;s residents are commuters to businesses and industries in Evansville and surrounding areas.

In 1994, Newburgh leaders planned to annex large areas that would have extended town limits to Frame Road (west) and SR 66 (north and east). This would have given Newburgh the ability to plan land use for large open, undeveloped areas. However, by 2001, the town&#x27;s leadership shifted its focus away from annexation toward planning in the well-established current town limits.

On November 6, 2005, the Evansville Tornado of November 2005 caused 25 deaths in nearby Evansville. Newburgh suffered extensive property damage and some injuries but suffered no fatalities during the 2:06 AM tornadic event.

The Old Newburgh Presbyterian Church and Original Newburgh Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Many of Newburgh&#x27;s prominent and notable buildings can be found in the Original Newburgh Historic District and developed between 1850 and 1930. Numerous buildings have been nominated to the National Register of Historic Places and satisfy the basic criteria of possessing outstanding significance on the national, state, or local level for history, architecture, environment, and/or integrity.

Newburgh uses the council-manager form of government, led by a five-member town council and a clerk-treasurer. The town council holds both legislative and executive powers while the clerk-treasurer is responsible for financial matters. All are elected for four-year terms. The council employs and oversees a town manager who is responsible for municipal personnel, budget, and day-to-day operations of the town government.

Some of the governmental functions are handled through Warrick County officials. The county maintains a small claims court that is fit for small, civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level circuit court.

Newburgh is represented by Holli Sullivan (District 78) in the Indiana State House of Representatives and Vaneta Becker (District 50) in the Indiana State Senate. The town is located in the 8th District of Indiana (map) and served by U.S. Representative Larry Bucshon, a resident of Newburgh.

<doc id="112677" wikidata="Q2167940" url="?curid=112677" title="New Pekin, Indiana">
<text>New Pekin is a town in Pierce and Polk townships, Washington County, Indiana, United States. The population was 1,401 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
The land for the town of New Pekin was first entered on August 25, 1818. The original town plat was made on December 23, 1883, by W. A. Graves. The town of New Pekin was incorporated in 1903 to provide funds to build and operate a school.

The New Pekin post office has been in operation since 1840.

===&quot;Old&quot; Pekin ===
On September 29, 1819, Isaac Davis entered section 30 in what was to become Polk Township. Several years later, in 1831, Christian Bixler laid out the town of Pekin on the south side of Mutton Fork, Blue River.

Before 1831, there were several buildings at this location. As early as 1830, stagecoaches were making regular runs between Jeffersonville and Salem. A wagon route between Salem and New Albany also passed through this area. Pekin was a staging stop where horses were watered and changed.

The town prospered until 1851, when the railroad was completed. The train station was built on the more level north side of the Blue River. Businesses gradually migrated to the new location. In 1854 the County Commissioners declared the town vacant and the area became known as Old Pekin.

===Fourth of July celebration===
The town of New Pekin claims the distinction of having the oldest consecutive Independence Day celebration in the United States of America. Pekin began celebrating Independence Day in the year 1830. However, Bristol, Rhode Island claims to have celebrated since 1785.

Few historical facts about the earliest celebrations exist, with the information available coming from oral tradition. The first several celebrations were said to be neighborhood affairs, though it is assumed that it did not stay that way for long. Many families lived in the surrounding townships and there were few social activities.

Various sources recount that the celebration was held near Old Pekin from 1830 until 1856. Around 1857, the celebration was moved to near the Blue River, where festivities were held until 1885. In either 1872 or 1873, the picnic was held at the farm of James Campbell, where he had built a recreational area.

The fall of 1884 saw the completion of the fairgrounds. The following year, the celebration was moved to the new fairgrounds. Many local residents did not agree with the celebration being moved there and held a second celebration at Tash Grove.

In 1909, the Gill brothers bought the southern part of the old fairgrounds, which became known as Gill&#x27;s Grove. This became the present location of the Pekin Community Park, where the celebration has been held every year since.

Today the celebration consists of a fireworks display, a parade, live bands, three-on-three basketball tournament, carnival, food vendors, a flea market, reading of the United States Declaration of Independence, prince and princess contest, horseshoe pitching contest, a queen contest, cookouts and many other small celebrations around the town of Pekin.

Former Indiana Rep. Mike Sodrel said in 2006, “If Norman Rockwell’s America exists anywhere today, it has to be in the 9th District of Indiana. There is nothing that I can think of that is more Americana and Rockwellesque than the Independence Day parade in Pekin.”

===Morgan&#x27;s Raid ===
On July 11, 1863, while crossing Blue River near New Pekin, Captain William J. Davis of Morgan&#x27;s Raid and some of his men were captured by 73rd Indiana Volunteers and a detachment of the 5th U.S. Regulars. Captain Davis and several other soldiers were taken to New Albany, Indiana, and secured in the county jail.

=== 2012 tornado ===

<text>Salem is a city in and the county seat of Washington Township, Washington County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 6,319 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Salem was laid out and platted in 1814. It was named for Salem, North Carolina, the hometown of one of the city founders.

The Salem post office has been in operation since 1816.

===Morgan&#x27;s Raid===
In June 1863, the Confederate cavalry under John Hunt Morgan had departed Tennessee on what would later become known as Morgan&#x27;s Raid. Traveling through Tennessee and into Kentucky, Morgan eventually crossed into Indiana; he reached Salem on July 10, 1863, coming north from Corydon. Upon entering Salem at approximately 9 a.m., Morgan immediately took possession of the town and placed guards over the stores and streets. The cavalrymen burned the large, brick railroad depot, along with all the train cars on the track and the railroad bridges on each side of the town. Morgan demanded taxes from the two flour mills that belonged to DePauw and Knight, and from the Allen Wollen Mill. Morgan&#x27;s men looted stores and took about $500 from the area before departing about 3 p.m.

Of the brief action at Salem, Col. Basil W. Duke, Morgan&#x27;s second-in-command and brother-in-law, later said:

&quot;They did not pillage with any sort of method or reason; it seemed to be a mania, senseless and purposeless. One man carried for two days a bird cage containing three canaries. Another rode with a huge chafing dish on the pommel of his saddle. Although the weather was intensely warm, another slung seven pairs of skates around his neck. I saw very few articles of real value taken; they pillaged like boys robbing an orchard.&quot;

===African Americans in Salem===
In 1898, Salem was recorded to be a sundown town, where African Americans were not allowed to reside. The last Black person who lived in Salem was Alexander White. The minister of the Salem Methodist Episcopal church married Alexander White and his wife Eliza Jane Demars on May 5, 1830. White ran a hotel in Salem. He was murdered in Salem in 1867. The killers were not punished, although one of them, Harvey Zink, was tried for the crime.

===Museums and other points of interest===
The downtown area is on the National Register of Historic Places, as are several local buildings.

The Carnegie Library in Salem was one of nearly 2,000 libraries built in the United States including 164 in Indiana in the early 20th century with funds donated by steel conglomerate Andrew Carnegie. Salem received the grant in February 1904, broke ground in August 1904 and opened in July 1905. Still in use today, the Carnegie Library in Salem is one of just one hundred in the state of Indiana still being used for its original purpose.

Located in the center of Salem&#x27;s town square, the Washington County Courthouse is generally known as Salem&#x27;s most famous and recognizable landmark. The courthouse has historical place markers surrounding it, and at the southeastern corner of the grounds, there is a memorial to veterans killed in action during conflicts dating back to the Revolutionary War.

The birthplace of John Hay has been a National Historic Site since 1971 and is located in Salem. The building was originally used as a school house and was built in 1824. It has been restored and furnished in the 1840 period.

===Public art===
In 2021, Rafael Blanco (artist) debuted the &quot;Salem Heritage&quot; mural. This 17-foot by 80-foot mural in Salem features portraits of six women who have made significant and historical contributions to the city. The women are Granny Lusk, Lula Desse Rudder, Bradie Shrum, Sarah Parke Morrison, Terry Hall, and Emma Christy-Baker. Each woman was born or lived in Salem. Granny Lusk&#x27;s family arrived in Washington County in 1817 and she informally practiced medicine in the community. Lula Desse Rudder was the first woman in the state of Indiana to be licensed as a pharmacist. Bradie Shrum was an elementary school teacher in Salem after whom Salem&#x27;s elementary school is named. Sarah Parke Morrison was born in Salem in 1833 and was the first woman student at Indiana University, the first woman to graduate from the institution, and later the first woman to be a member of the faculty. Terry Hall, who coached women athletes at both the high school and college level, is the &quot;winningest coach in University of Kentucky basketball history.&quot; Emma Christy-Baker was born in 1865, &quot;the great-granddaughter of freed slaves.&quot; She was one of the first women, and the first African American person, the Indianapolis Police Department hired.

==Sports==
Salem is also home to Salem Speedway. It is a half mile high banked paved oval that was first built in 1947. Many of the most legendary drivers of the past 50 years have raced there including Ted Horn, Parnelli Jones, A. J. Foyt, Bobby and Al Unser, Mario Andretti, Larry Dickson, Darrell Waltrip and Jeff Gordon. A. J. Foyt at one time held the world record for a half mile oval at the speedway. One of ESPN&#x27;s first televised auto racing events was held there in 1979.

==1988 bomb scare==
On July 5, 1988, 13 homemade bombs placed inside brown grocery bags were discovered near bridges and buildings around the town containing sticks of dynamite. However, due to faulty blasting caps, none of the bombs exploded. Had the explosives gone off, it would have severed the town from outside aid.

Two men, John Hubbard and Jerry Conrad, were convicted on all counts in September and October 1989. Prosecutors allege that Hubbard had a long-standing rivalry with Democratic State Representative Frank Newkirk Jr.

==History==
Centerville was platted in 1814 on land bought from the Miami Indians at the Twelve Mile Purchase. It was settled by Quakers originally from Centreville, Delaware. Centre Monthly Meeting in Delaware is part of Baltimore Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends, whose Indian relations office first sent a delegation of Quakers to Indiana Territory at the request of Chief Little Turtle of the Miami Indians, who visited them in Baltimore. Friends from Delaware lived for a time in Guilford County, North Carolina before permanently moving to Indiana Territory when it opened for settlement. The community is said to be named for its location near the middle of the county, but it’s not in the center. A little-known county seat war was fought in Wayne County in 1873 between Centerville and Richmond. The county seat had been located in Centerville (Center Township) since 1818. By 1870, Richmond (Wayne Township) had surpassed Centerville in business, population, and tax revenue. These factors led the population of Wayne Township to demand the county seat be moved to Richmond. The dispute was played out in the newspapers, courts, and petitions, with Richmond the eventual winner.
A new courthouse was erected in Richmond and preparations were made to move records from Centerville to Richmond. Centerville residents twice stopped Richmond&#x27;s officials’ efforts to move the records, first with guarded locked gates, then by firing on their own courthouse with a three-pound cannon nicknamed “Black Betty.” The cannon was used when Richmond guards were brought in to protect the records. The cannon had been loaded with iron scraps. A crowd demanded the guard come out of the Centerville courthouse. When they refused, the cannon was fired, the door blown off its hinges, and the guards were forced to beat a hasty retreat. Soldiers were brought in the next day to move the records to Richmond. Centerville&#x27;s tenure as county seat had come to an end. The holes from the cannon shot are still visible over the door of the old courthouse, now the Center Township Library.
The Centerville post office has been in operation since 1818.

In 1828 the National Road, which ran along Centerville&#x27;s Main Street, was surveyed. It later became the first improved section of the trail in 1850 by a Special Act of Congress.

Centerville&#x27;s cobblestone street was a major stop along the trail to the West. During the height of the Gold Rush, 49,000 wagons would travel along the street each year.

Centerville is known as the “City of Arches” due to the five main arches on the Old National Road. The original road was 100 feet (30.5 m) wide, but was reduced to 65 feet (19.8 m) after several buildings in the town had encroached into the roadway. The arches were used as a way to get behind the buildings and into the backyards of the houses. The five arches in Centerville are the Backenstoes, Dill, Shortridge, Lantz, and Malone Archways, all built between 1823 and 1836. In August, Centerville has Archway Days, held to celebrate the historical archways.
The Centerville Historic District (Centerville, Indiana), Oliver P. Morton House, and Westcott Stock Farm are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>East Germantown is a town in Jackson Township, Wayne County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 410 at the 2010 census.

==History==
East Germantown was originally called Georgetown, and under the latter name was laid out and platted in 1827.

The East Germantown Civil War Band was assigned to the 12th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment in 1862.

A post office operated from March 31, 1846, until August 4, 1917, under the name of East Germantown, when its name officially changed to Pershing due to events surrounding World War I.

A resolution to change the town name from East Germantown to Pershing, in honor of General Pershing, was introduced by the town board. A faction campaigned the day before the name-change vote by telling people that since their deeds mentioned &quot;East Germantown&quot;, changing to &quot;Pershing&quot; would invalidate their ownership. Ernest G. Lamott (1911–1980), secretary-treasurer of the town board at the time, said the vote went for &quot;East Germantown&quot; since voters had no way of proving or disproving this assertion in the hours before the election.

The postmaster in 1917, Frank Sipe, succeeded in getting the post office name changed to &quot;Pershing&quot;. However, the railroad continued with the name East Germantown since there is another Pershing, an unincorporated community, in Fulton County.

The local Pershing Elementary School at 519 Queen Street is now the administrative offices for the Western Wayne School Corporation.

<doc id="112693" wikidata="Q748325" url="?curid=112693" title="Bluffton, Indiana">
<text>Bluffton is a city in and the county seat of Wells County, Indiana, United States. It sits on the banks of the Wabash River in the northeastern part of the state. The population was 10,308 at the 2020 census, up from 9,897 at the 2010 census. Bluffton is nicknamed the &quot;Parlor City&quot; for its history of having some of the first clean paved streets in the area during the time of the Indiana gas boom.

==History==
===Early settlement and incorporation===
The first non-Native American settlers arrived in what is now Bluffton in 1835. They arrived as a result of the end of the Black Hawk War as well as the completion of the Erie Canal. They consisted entirely of settlers from New England. These were &quot;Yankee&quot; settlers, that is to say they were descended from the English Puritans who settled New England in the colonial era. They were primarily members of the Congregational Church though due to the Second Great Awakening many of them had converted to Methodism and some had become Baptists before coming to what is now Bluffton. The Congregational Church subsequently has gone through many divisions and some factions are now known as the Church of Christ and Church of God. When the New England settlers arrived in what is now Bluffton there was nothing but a dense virgin forest and wild prairie.

Bluffton was platted in 1838, it was named for river bluffs near the original town site. The Bluffton post office has been in operation since 1839. In its early years it was a primitive, backwoods village, subject to frequent floods of the Wabash and outbreaks of malaria. Wells Country was organized in 1837 and shortly thereafter four commissioners were appointed to choose the county seat. The contestants for the county seat of government were Bluffton, Vera Cruz and Murray, but it was later narrowed to just two, Bluffton and Murray. The four commissioners struggled to determine the location of the county seat at first, but on March 5, 1838, Bluffton was named the county seat after their final vote. Mr. Abraham Studabaker and Robert C. Bennet, both landowners in Bluffton, set aside land for a county courthouse and donated US$270 (). On March 9, 1838, the commissioners chose the site for the county courthouse which used the land donated by Abram Studabaker and Robert C. Bennet &quot;with a reserve of two choice lots&quot;.

The first county courthouse was erected in 1840 by David Whitman. it was a 2-story building located on the west side of Main Street, between Market and Wabash streets.

Bluffton was incorporated in 1851 with 850 people.

===Industrial growth===
In 1848, the idea of a 10-mile planked road from Bluffton to Fort Wayne gained popularity throughout the city. In 1849 a ten-mile stretch of the plank road was constructed by city locals. From 1852 to 1856 the road was planked before being disused – replaced by a gravel road.

As early as the 1840s and 1850s there were plans made for railroads. However, none of them had been successful. In 1852 the first railroad known as the Fort Wayne, Cincinnati Louisville Railroad was surveyed but it was delayed due to the Civil War. From 1867 - 1868 the railroad began construction through Bluffton and by 1869 it was completed. The advent of the railroad brought great prosperity to Bluffton and would help ditch the numerous swamps that brought risks such as malaria and flooding.

In the 1890s the construction of the iconic 5 story Richardsonian Romanesque style sandstone courthouse was completed, ushering in a new era for Bluffton and Wells County. Bluffton was included in the corporate name of the short-lived Cincinnati, Bluffton and Chicago Railroad, founded in 1903. The railroad&#x27;s Bluffton bridge collapsed on May 22, 1913, and the struggling carrier went out of business shortly thereafter.

=== African American history ===
Bluffton is one of the first towns in Indiana, and across America, to both publicly acknowledge its history of exclusion as a sundown town and to promote itself as an inclusive town. In 2006, Bluffton was featured in &quot;USA Today&quot; as an inclusive town that was putting up welcoming, inclusive signs at all local schools as well as at the entrances of three state highways. Mayor Ted Ellis was noted in the article for his helping Bluffton become one of the first to join the National League of Cities&#x27; &quot;Partnership for Working Toward Inclusive Communities&quot;.

===The Parlor City===
The City of Bluffton is nicknamed the &quot;Parlor City&quot; for its history of having some of the first clean paved streets in the area during the time of the Trenton Oil boom. Most streets at the time were dirt. The nickname came from the fact that the parlor in someone&#x27;s home at the time would be the cleanest room in the house because that is the first space that your guests see when they come into your home. Entering downtown today, the brand-new Parlor City Plaza acts as the first thing you see, along with the historic courthouse, justifying the &quot;Parlor City&quot; nickname.

<text>Ossian is a town in Jefferson Township, Wells County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. The town was named after Ossian, the narrator of a cycle of epic poems by the Scottish poet James Macpherson. The population was 3,289 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The Ossian post office has been in operation since 1850. In 1843, Indiana State Road 1 was made serviceable from Fort Wayne to Bluffton. On January 25, 1850, the Fort Wayne and Bluffton Plank Road Company was then organized. The plank road was a toll road; any horse or horse-drawn vehicle had to pay a toll. The Fort Wayne, Cincinnati, &amp; Louisville Railroad was built through Ossian in 1869, though it was not in complete operation until the following year. Today, the railroad is a significant north–south route for the Norfolk Southern Corporation. Ossian is still served by Indiana State Road 1, while four miles north is Interstate 469, the beltway around Fort Wayne, and also just seven miles south of Fort Wayne International Airport.

A 25-foot tall grain silo was painted to look like a minion from the Despicable Me movie on a nearby rural farm in 2016. A Vietnam War veteran mentioned the idea to his family and when he died at 73, family and friends painted it as a way to honor his memory. The grain silo soon became popular with people stopping by to view it from the road and was picked up by national news.

==Geography==

Chalmers was platted on July 24, 1873; it included 103 lots on six streets. Several homes and stores were erected, and a school was constructed in the early 1870s. The first church was organized in 1878, and a tile factory was erected in the same year. The Bank of Chalmers was established by Jacob Raub in the early 1890s with a capital of $10,000. Chalmers became an incorporated town in 1892. &quot;The Ledger&quot; served as the first community newspaper, published initially in 1893. In 1895, a train station which later became a symbol of the town&#x27;s history was constructed.
The village was originally known by many as &quot;Mudge&#x27;s Station,&quot; after Gardner Mudge. The name &quot;Chalmers&quot; was listed on railroad timetables of New Albany and Salem as early as 1856. By 1912, Chalmers had approximately 600 residents. It consisted of two grain elevators, a factory, fifteen stores, two banks, two livery barns, three blacksmith shops, a lumber yard, two hotels, two garages, and dozens of homes.

<text>Monon is a town in Monon Township, White County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 1,777 at the 2010 census.

==History==

The town of Monon was platted by James Brooks in 1853 as &quot;New Bradford&quot;. This act by the president of the New Albany and Salem Railroad (predecessor of the Monon Railroad) foretold the story of the town. The town would grow as the train company prospered, but once &quot;The Monon&quot; declined, so would the town&#x27;s economy.

The town&#x27;s name is derived from the names of two creeks nearby, the Big Monon and the Little Monon. The spelling of the name of the creeks was formerly Monong, a Potawatomi word which one authority says meant &quot;swift-running&quot;. In the 1840s, the town&#x27;s name was used as a nickname for the railroad company, and in 1856 the company formally adopted it as its corporate name. The first post office was established in 1838 under the name Monon, and when the town was incorporated in 1879, it legally adopted the post office&#x27;s name as the town&#x27;s name.

The town of Monon is situated on an important junction of different branches of the Monon lines. The northern division came into Monon and turned ninety degrees heading south to Lafayette and Louisville, Kentucky. Another line comes from Indianapolis and turned east. Another line headed north to Michigan City.

In its heyday, the Monon Railroad had two train yards in Monon. The main yard was 11 tracks wide with a capacity for 270 cars. The South Yard was narrower, 5 tracks wide, but longer and had a 278-car capacity.

There are no longer passenger train services, as has the line to Indianapolis and most of the line to Michigan City was closed. The only trains through Monon now are a CSX Transportation line from Maynard, Indiana to Lafayette and another on a portion of the old Michigan City line.

The Monon post office has been in operation since 1849.

North White High School Vikings football coach Jim Davis led the Vikings to a 14–0 season and class 1A football state championship in 1994 by defeating Sheridan High School 34–7 at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis. The Vikings were class 1A football state runner-up in 1998 under Davis.

The town is trying to pass plans that would include a new downtown area that they believe would attract more visitors and more people to live in the town.

Through the efforts of the Monon Civic Preservation Society the Monon Commercial Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. The Society maintains the historic Civic Center (originally the Arlington Hotel), the Monon Theater, and the Monon Railroad Caboose Memorial Park.

<text>Monticello ( ) is a city in and the county seat of White County, Indiana, United States. The population was 5,508 at the 2020 census. Monticello is known as a tourist destination in north-central Indiana and is home to the Indiana Beach amusement park on Lake Shafer, and Lake Freeman.

==History==

Monticello was laid out in 1834 as the county seat, with a post office established that year, and is still currently in operation. The city was named after President Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s estate in Virginia.

Monticello, Indiana sustained serious damage by a tornado on April 3, 1974, part of the 1974 Super Outbreak that caused death and destruction across the midwest and south. The aftermath of this storm is recorded in the Herald Journal&#x27;s book, &quot;Killer Tornado&quot;. The tornado was rated F4 on the Fujita scale. This storm killed eight people and was part of tornado family that killed 18, causing an estimated $100 million in damage. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, news outlets reported three hundred deaths across the United States and the creation of temporary morgues. The local paper said the aftermath was similar to a World War II bombing.

On September 2, 2005, Jordan Manufacturing burned down. The company manufactured outdoor furniture such as folding chairs, umbrellas, and seat cushions. Due to the materials used in making these products, four city blocks were contaminated with toxins. The blaze was large enough to require firefighters from seven surrounding communities to battle it and needed approximately &quot;3000 gallons of water per minute for the first three hours of the blaze.&quot; While such a fire might not be a big event for a larger city, it had a profound impact on Monticello, as Jordan Manufacturing was one of the few manufacturing plants left in the city after a recession in the 2000s.

The Monticello Carnegie Library, James Culbertson Reynolds House, and South Grade School Building are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
Norway was originally called Mt. Walleston, and under the latter name was laid out in 1845. A large share of the early settlers being natives of Norway caused the present name to be selected. A post office was established at Norway in 1898, but was soon discontinued, in 1899.

Norway is on Tippecanoe River just below the Norway Dam. The dam holds Lake Shafer, the home of Indiana Beach, an amusement park and campground. Norway&#x27;s Southern boundary is also the Northern boundary of Monticello, the more populated county seat and just west of Norway there is the golf course and hotel resort, Pine View.

Despite the small area and population, the central location of Norway and the convenience of the Norway Bridge river crossing (connecting the more populated West Shafer and East Shafer Drives) have allowed for the continued presence and success of several restaurants and other small businesses.

===BioTown, USA===

In 2005, the Indiana State Department of Agriculture began a program to make Reynolds an energy self-sufficient community, able to subsist almost entirely on locally produced alternative energy. Called &quot;BioTown, USA&quot;, the pilot project involved converting local vehicles to run on ethanol and biodiesel fuels and converting animal waste into electricity and natural gas.

Reynolds was selected to become BioTown, USA because of its size, its easy accessibility by road and by rail, and its proximity to both large-scale livestock farms and to Purdue University (Purdue is located in West Lafayette, Indiana). This process has been slow but Reynolds still holds the title.

A post office, which with a zip code of 47995, the highest zip code within Indiana, has been in operation at Wolcott since 1861.

The Wolcott House was formerly listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Wolcott July 4 Summer Festival has been celebrated every year since 1967 on the grounds of the Wolcott House, except for 2020 due to the Coronavirus outbreak. It is now (as of 2022) celebrated on the weekend prior to the 4th of July.

Major businesses in Wolcott (as of 2020) include Indiana Ribbon (one of the few decorative ribbon manufacturing plants left in the U.S.), Dwyer Instruments, the Bank of Wolcott (with branches in Remington and Monticello), Cives Steel Company, and the Farmers Elevator.

Wolcott aims to become the quietest town in America after passing a new town ordinance in 2022.

<doc id="112707" wikidata="Q2724215" url="?curid=112707" title="Churubusco, Indiana">
<text>Churubusco ( or ); often shortened to Busco (), is a town located near the headwaters of the Eel River in the extreme northeast corner of Whitley County, Indiana, United States, in Smith Township, about northwest of Fort Wayne. The population was 1,796 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Originally, the area of Churubusco was made up of two towns founded in the 19th century by European Americans: Union and Franklin (in honor of Founding Father Benjamin Franklin) that bordered each other across a railroad track. In the 1840s, the populations of both Franklin and Union grew large enough to qualify each for a post office. Before that time, residents of both towns had to trek 11 miles by foot or horse and buggy to nearby Columbia City to get their mail. Since the towns were in the same location, the Postmaster General ordered the towns to apply for a joint post office. The Postmaster General denied the use of either &quot;Union&quot; and &quot;Franklin&quot; as the new post office name, since both were already used by other Indiana towns.

After a community meeting, the residents selected Churubusco for the new post office, named after the site of the 1847 Battle of Churubusco, in Mexico during the Mexican–American War. At the time, after the suggestion of local school teacher Eliza Rich, the townsfolk thought it was as patriotic a name as Union and Franklin, since the United States won a large victory there. More importantly, they were certain no other Indiana town would already have chosen such a unique name. The Churubusco post office has been in operation since 1848.

The name &quot;Churubusco&quot; is a Spanish corruption of an indigenous Nahuatl toponym (place name) referring to a temple area celebrating the Aztec god &quot;Huitzilopochtli&quot;. It is bordered by the Rio Churubusco in Mexico City. The Spanish-Nahuatl word literally translates as &#x27;place (or temple) of &quot;Huitzilopochtli&quot; (the left side or south of the hummingbird)&#x27;.

==Culture==

Churubusco is home to the oldest continually held festival in Indiana. This event is held yearly at the local park grounds and features many different rides, games, live music, and vendors for the enjoyment of people of all ages. Turtle Days is rooted in the lore of Oscar the Turtle or the &quot;Beast of Busco&quot;, a giant snapping turtle that reportedly haunted nearby Fulk&#x27;s Lake in Allen County. Many have tried to catch the monster turtle but no successful attempt has ever been recorded. He has been thought to be the size of a small car. The lake he is rumored to hide in has been drained, but no evidence was found. A popular theory as to why this turtle is so elusive is because the lakes and ponds around Churubusco are connected through an extensive series of channels and streams; some of which are tunnels. Many locals have claimed to see the beast but until evidence can be found, Oscar will still be a mystery of Churubusco, Indiana. Churubusco has multiple murals and statues commemorating this local legend around the down town area as well as inside of Smith green community schools.

Churubusco recently completed phase one of the Downtown Revitalization Project, funded in part with a Main Street Revitalization Grant. The completed phase reconstructed sidewalks, added decorative lighting and landscaping features, and new benches and trash receptacles along the 100 block of North Main Street (US 33), enhancing the beauty of the downtown area. Churubusco&#x27;s downtown is home to many locally owned shops including an antique store, two barber shops, a hardware store, a secondhand clothing store, and restaurants. One famous restaurant, Magic Wand, is located on South Main Street. It has been owned and operated by the same family since 1964 and is a family friendly diner that also has an outside ice-cream shop. This Indiana landmark is famous for its unusual decor, with the inside of the restaurant decorated with hundreds of clowns.

Churubusco Chamber of Commerce and the Town of Churubusco have been instrumental in creating events that have assisted in the improvement of the quality of life for town residents. Every August, Churubusco hosts the &#x27;Busco Block Party. This free event features local merchants, live music, and other events. The Chamber and the Town have also partnered to organize Halloweenfest. Held the Saturday before Halloween, the event features a merchant trick-or-treat, costume contest, hayrides, and more. Hundreds of children attend the event and it continues to grow every year.

It is part of the Fort Wayne MSA.

==History==

The first non-Native American settlers arrived in 1837 as a result of the end of the Black Hawk War and the Erie Canal. They were from New England - &quot;Yankee&quot; Settlers, descendants of the English Puritans who settled New England in the colonial era. They were primarily members of the Congregational Church though due to the Second Great Awakening many of them had converted to Methodism and some had become Baptists before coming to what is now Columbia City.

Columbia City was founded in 1839, originally just being called &quot;Columbia&quot;. The name was later changed in 1854 since there was already a city named Columbia in the state. Many public debates were held to discuss different names for the city, but it was later only reduced to two: &quot;Beaver&quot; and &quot;Columbia City.&quot; Eventually, the name Columbia City was selected.

The completion of the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne, &amp; Chicago Railway in 1856 brought rapid growth to the small town, and from 1865 to 1875 the population would have tripled. Columbia City was incorporated in the state of Indiana in 1888.

The Whitley County Courthouse was designed (1888–1891) by Brentwood S. Tolan, of Fort Wayne, Indiana. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The Thomas R. Marshall House was added to the register in 1983 and the Columbia City Historic District was added in 1987.

<text>Adair is a city in Adair and Guthrie counties of Iowa in the United States. The population was 791 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The Rock Island Railroad was built through the area in 1868, which led to the area being known as Summit Cut. This was in reference to the ridge that forms the watershed divide between the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. The town officially became known as Adair on August 20, 1872, when it was incorporated with the county. The town is named after General John Adair, a general in the War of 1812 who later became the eighth governor of Kentucky. Adair was the scene of the first successful train robbery in the American West when on July 21, 1873, the James-Younger Gang (led by Jesse James) took US $3,000 from the Rock Island Express after derailing it southwest of the town. The derailment killed the engineer.

A rare F5 tornado occurred near this town on June 27, 1953, although the damage occurred closer to the town of Anita. One person was killed and two others were injured.

Adair is recognizable from Interstate 80 by its tall yellow &quot;smiley-face&quot; water tower. Its roadsign warmly greets visitors with, &quot;Welcome to Adair; it&#x27;ll make you smile&quot;. Some of the local businesses incorporate the smiley-face tower image into their company logos.
Adair is mentioned in the 2013 Stephen King novel &quot;Doctor Sleep&quot;.

In February 2024, Adair Police Chief Brad Wendt was convicted on 11 of 15 federal charges, for conspiring to make false statements to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and illegal possession of a machine gun. &quot;Authorities say he bought machine guns for the police department, then sold them for an almost $80,000 personal profit. Trial evidence showed he bought machine guns for his gun store, including a .50-caliber machine gun he mounted to his own armored Humvee&quot;.

==History==
Casey was platted in 1869. The community has the name of a railroad man. The firm John and James Casey, Contractors, from Erie, Pennsylvania, under John F. Tracy, President of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific, built the railroad across Iowa, and through Casey, from 1866 to 1869. Most of the streets in the town are named for Union Army generals in the American Civil War.

In 2015 the City Clerk, Dorothy Dillinger, was indicted for misappropriation of city funds and burning down the city hall. She stole up to $300,000 in city funds and spent it on purchases at Victoria&#x27;s Secret and Wal-Mart, among other places. Dillinger pleaded guilty in federal court and received a prison sentence of five years from judge James E. Gritzner. A new city hall and community center, which replaced the one destroyed in an attempt to cover up the embezzlement, had its groundbreaking in 2018. The estimated cost is $1 million. The majority of the building would be dedicated to community center functions.

Munger is responsible for the design of Greenfield&#x27;s unique Lancaster-style town square, and the city park located at Grant and NE Second Street was also included in the original plat. Greenfield is named after Greenfield, Massachusetts. Greenfield became the county seat in 1875, after battling out nearby Fontanelle for the title. The city was incorporated on May 22, 1876.

Greenfield is home to four entries on the National Register of Historic Places, the E. E. Warren Opera House listed in 1970; the Adair County Courthouse, listed in 1981; the Adair County Democrat/Adair County Free Press building, listed 2012; and Hotel Greenfield, listed 2012.

Sidey, founders of the Adair County Democrat in 1889, later the Adair County Free Press. Edwin&#x27;s son Kenneth (1895–1976) and grandson Edwin J. Sidey (1925–2008) succeeded as publishers and editors. Well-known White House reporter forTime/Life and author Hugh Sidey (1927–2005), brother of Edwin J., was also closely associated over time with the family&#x27;s journalism and photojournalism legacies.

==Arts and culture==

===Adair County Courthouse===

Greenfield&#x27;s unique Courthouse, built in Romanesque style and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981, was constructed in 1891 after the original was destroyed in a fire. The Courthouse was designed by S. E. Maxon. The country&#x27;s wars have taken their toll on artifacts surrounding the structure. A gazebo on the south lawn was burned during a World War I victory celebration and cannon that once decorated both entrances were melted down during a World War II scrap iron drive.

===Warren Cultural Center / E. E. Warren Opera House===

The E. E. Warren Opera House was constructed on the site of the old courthouse in 1896. The three-story structure was built by E. E. Warren and his wife, Eva. Edward Earnest Warren was born in New London, Iowa on March 31, 1862. In 1884, Edward married Eva Mary Viers from Fontanelle, Iowa. Eva was born in Washington, Iowa in 1863. The Warrens built their new store and opera house in 1896, in company with John J. Hetherington. Mr Hetherington was born in Pennsylvania in 1842. The idea of a building containing both a store and opera house was first announced in Greenfield in 1895. The building site was formerly occupied by the original courthouse which had burned down. The building&#x27;s store conducted its grand opening on December 1, 1896. The storefront windows had been curtained until the opening ceremony. At 7:30 pm the curtains were raised and the crowd rushed the door, breaking it from the force. A string quintet provided live music for visitors. Upstairs the Opera House was awaiting its chairs. Mr Warren finally had his own store building. In 1913, the business became titled &quot;Warren Dry Goods Company&quot;. Eva worked as the company&#x27;s bookkeeper. Mr Hetherington was simultaneously building his new store alongside the E. E. Warren Opera House.

In the early years, the Opera House hosted traveling theatrical troupes, medicine shows, musical productions and local theatre. Though the upper floors declined in usage, the ground floor was used as retail space until 1990. The Opera House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

In 1996, the E. E. Warren Opera House Association was formed to save and restore the building and its integrity. The association has made numerous structural and aesthetic improvements to the interior and exterior of the building. The association recently acquired the adjacent Hetherington Building and Taylor Building. The mission of the association is to create a cultural center which will promote all forms of the arts. There will be retail and dining space to enhance the visitor&#x27;s experience and the facility aims to support live theatre performances, concerts, art exhibits and many more entertaining events. The completed renovation will be known as The Warren Cultural Center, with grand opening in May 2012. Upcoming events can be followed online at http://www.warrenoperahouse.com/ 

===Hotel Greenfield===

Hotel Greenfield, operated by ADCO Enterprises, LC, dates to 1920, the city&#x27;s fourth hotel and the third at 110 East Iowa Street, preceded at this site by The Wilson Hotel and later the Commercial Hotel. It is the largest commercial building in the central business district. Many early hotel patrons traveled to town by the C, B &amp; Q freight-passenger train and were shuttled from the south Greenfield depot. Others arrived by automobile via Iowa&#x27;s developing highway system.

Despite the shadow of the Great War (WW I) local boosters were yet able to capitalize a 32-room state-of-the-art lodge at a cost of $65,000. Regional architect William Gordon designed the Classical Revival (Commercial) style building, to be constructed starting in 1919. It was completed and furnished by 1920. A gala Grand Opening was featured June 3, 1920, with William Don Carlos and George Musmaker toastmasters of the evening.

The original “Greenfield Hotel Company” of April 8, 1919, was founded by local business owners and town boosters as a community improvement project, more than as a profit-making enterprise, as such. The company, an Iowa corporation, owned the hotel until July 12, 1951. Lawyer George Musmaker, president, and banker Jay Howe, secretary-treasurer, were two of the company&#x27;s primary leaders during those first 32 years. Individuals and families owned and operated the business after that.

===Freedom Rock===
The Freedom Rock is a large boulder that marks the entrance to an old rock quarry. Beginning in 1999, Ray &quot;Bubba&quot; Sorensen II has painted the rock every Memorial Day with different patriotic images and sayings in support of the United States military. There are also several murals throughout Adair County featuring Bubba&#x27;s patriotic artwork.

Established in 1986, the Adair County Heritage Museum is a five-acre complex dedicated to preserving and display- in the history of Adair County for the benefit and enlightenment of future generations. Located on the west edge of Greenfield, it is operated by the Adair County Historical Society .

===Schildberg Antique Car Collection===
Dennis Schildberg, a local car collector, needed a location to house his extensive collection of antique cars. After remodeling an old Ford dealership building, he was able to house his cars and display them for the public to enjoy. He started collecting cars with his wife Marlene in the early 1960s, and since then they have collected over 15 antique vehicles. All the vehicles are in running condition except a 1936 Chevy.

In 1982, Schildberg started restoring the cars. The Schildbergs involve their cars in parades and car shows. Although Schildberg died in 1992, his collection is still available to the public. The museum is open by appointment and for special local events.

He earned the Triple Crown of pitching in 1924 and was also named Most Valuable Player that same year. Vance was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955.

===Henry A. Wallace===
U.S. Vice President Henry A. Wallace (1941–45) was born on a farm near Orient in 1888. The original farmstead is now home to the Henry A. Wallace Country Life Center, a popular tour site. Wallace founded seed corn company Pioneer Hi-Bred in 1926 and was an editor of Wallace&#x27;s Farmer magazine. President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Wallace to be US Secretary of Agriculture (1933–41) at the depth of the Great Depression. He also served as US Secretary of Commerce (1945–46); and later ran unsuccessfully for President on the Progressive Party ticket in 1948. Wallace was a key figure in assisting Roosevelt to formulate “New Deal” economic recovery policies and in helping the US prepare to join the Allies in defeating Japan and Germany in World War II. He was named the “Most Influential Iowan of the 20th Century” in 1999 by the &quot;Des Moines Register&quot;.

<doc id="112719" wikidata="Q589014" url="?curid=112719" title="Carbon, Iowa">
<text>Carbon is a rural hamlet in Douglas Township, Adams County, Iowa, United States. The population was 36 at the 2020 census. There is a church at Carbon, and a community center, and no other businesses or services. It is the 24th smallest place in Iowa by population.

As of 2021, the hamlet is included in the United States Census Bureau&#x27;s census-designated place bearing its name.

Other places in Iowa have been named Carbon: there was a Carbon Post Office in Davis County, six miles south of Ottumwa, that operated for less than a year in 1881. There was also a Carbon Post Office in Webster County, three miles south-east of Fort Dodge, that operated from 1870 to 1872. A post office on the latter location was known as Gypsum from 1902 to 1905.

== History ==
Carbon is located on the Middle Nodaway River. This was home to the Pottawatomie, Oto and Iowa Indian tribes, until the treaty of 1851 forced their removal to Kansas or Indian Territory, now known as Oklahoma. The first settler to Carbon was Elijah Walters, who established a sawmill there in 1849. He reported seeing huts and old camp fires but stated that the tribes had moved on, only to see an occasional &quot;red man&quot; appear and look over old camp sites and burial sites, then move on. Elijah built a mill on the Middle Nodaway river that became a great social center of its time.

The village was originally named Walters, after its first settler, but was renamed Carbon after the discovery of coal. The town was established in 1873, but was not incorporated until 1903. A post office was established in Carbon in 1874, but from 1877 to 1880, the name was changed to Shinn.

By the time of the Civil War, there were small coal mines along the riverbanks near Carbon. In 1894, there were nine coal mines in Carbon, of which five were then in use. Typical mine shafts were 80 feet deep, working a coal seam 12 to 20 inches (30 to 50 cm) thick. The town at that time was described as a mining camp. Unlike the vast majority of Iowa&#x27;s coal camps, the UMWA had no union local in Carbon between 1900 and 1912; during that period, most of Iowa&#x27;s coal camps were organized, and the largest UMWA locals in the country were based in Buxton and Centerville, Iowa.

By 1908, it was estimated that the total coal production of the county had exceeded 350,000 tons, despite the lack of any rail connections. Most of this was from the Carbon area. Coal from the Carbon mines was sold locally, with some sold as far away as Corning and other towns within a 25-mile radius. The two most notable mines in the area in 1908 were the Jones, Smith and Tindall mine, a new mine employing 25 miners, 1/4 mile south of Carbon and the J.F. Ruth mine, a year-old mine employing 30 miners, 1/2 mile northeast of town. Both used horse whims to power their hoists, and had minimal safety features. At the time, one other mine had recently been closed by a cave-in, and another was just being opened.

The heyday of the Carbon coal mines lasted approximately 75 years, beginning in the late 19th century and ending in the early 20th century. Carbon has always been known as a lawless town for those that like to fight. Many a gun fight did take place in the streets when the coal mines were booming. Until 1998, the only water supply was on what is now called the &quot;pump road&quot;. On the edge of this road, sits an old hand pump. The pump has stood for over 100 years. Horse-drawn wagons would carry ice from the river and water from the pump back to town. Only one home within the Carbon city limits had a well. It was only in the late 1990s that rural water was finally piped in.

==Geography==
Carbon is located on the south bank of the Middle Nodaway River, just east of its confluence with Bull Creek.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

== History ==

=== French Icarian settlement ===

The first European settlers here were a group of French Icarians who came from Nauvoo, Illinois in 1852; they established a community near Lake Icaria, north of Corning in 1854. The new state of Iowa gave the town of &quot;Icaria&quot; a corporate charter in 1860. This community was dedicated to the utopian principles of Etienne Cabet and the democratic principles of the American Revolution and the French Revolution; this small French-speaking community considered themselves to be very patriotic Americans. In the 1860s, the community split between &quot;traditionalists&quot; and &quot;progressives&quot; (the latter favored women&#x27;s right to vote). The &quot;progressives&quot; left the original site and moved to a new location about three miles (5 km) east of Corning&#x27;s location. Although the corporation formally dissolved in 1878, some continued to live in the communal dwellings until 1898, making this the longest-lasting Icarian colony in the United States. Eventually the community disbanded and merged into the general population. Displays and documents about the Icarian community can be found at the Icarian History Foundation office and in the Adams County offices, both in Corning. The former colony east of Corning is slowly being restored with the help of state and federal grants, and it will become a historical site; as of 2006, only a couple of partially restored buildings and a very small cemetery (with grave markers inscribed in French) remain. Around the first weekend of June each year, Corning celebrates &quot;Le Festival De L&#x27;Heritage Francais&quot; in the French market.

=== American settlement ===
Nearby Queen City had been established &quot;circa&quot; 1854. Surveyors came to the location of Corning in 1857, though the area was largely uninhabited (except by the Icarians) until 1869.

The first Adams County seat was established by act of the Iowa Legislature on January 12, 1853, at Quincy. The building was later used as a schoolhouse and in 1932, it was torn down. In November 1872, the people voted to remove the courthouse from Quincy and locate the county seat in Corning.

==Points of Interest==
The Corning post office contains a mural, &quot;Band Concert&quot;, painted in 1941 by Marion Gilmore. Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department. Gilmore&#x27;s original entry won a federal-sponsored Forty-Eight States design competition in 1939 and depicted a Sunday band concert but a local jury of concerned citizens requested that Gilmore&#x27;s image contain only actual architecture and landmarks in the downtown district and that she remove a cannon and an obelisk from the image. Gilmore made the changes to accommodate a WPA requirement stipulating that murals should &quot;suit the taste of the local townspeople&quot;.

In 1996, Main Street Corning won the Spirit of Main Street Award, and in 1998 received the Great American Main Street Award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation&#x27;s National Main Street Center. The Main Street program is a volunteer driven program. Main Street Corning volunteers have logged over 76,606 hours since Corning became an Iowa Main Street Community in 1990.

The Johnny Carson board has restored the birthplace of Johnny Carson according to photographs, with a museum available to visitors.
