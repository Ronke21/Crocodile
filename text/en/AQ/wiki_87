It became the county seat in 1839 with 110 residents and grew to 650 by 1847. Its library was established in 1853, and it held its first fair in 1854. Early architecture in Fairfield includes work by George Franklin Barber and Barry Byrne.

==History==
The area now known as Jefferson County was first settled in 1836 and became Jefferson County in 1839, with the new community of Fairfield as the county seat. The name was suggested by Nancy Bonnifield, one of the settlers, because it aptly described the fair fields of the area. But author Susan Welty suggests it was also a play of words on the woman&#x27;s own name (bonny field). By 1840, Fairfield had a population of 110 and grew to 650 in 1847. The city was the site of the first and second Iowa State Fairs.

The first fair was held October 25–27, 1854, on of land surrounded by a fence. The total cost to hold the fair was around $320, and public admission was 25 cents per person. It is estimated that between 7,000 and 10,000 fair goers attended this historical event. Parsons College was founded in 1875. In 1893, the Carnegie Library was completed, the first west of the Mississippi. During the time leading up to the American Civil War, Fairfield was a stopping point for the Underground Railroad. Ultimately, over 1,600 residents of Jefferson County served in the Union Army.

Early architecture in Fairfield includes Victorian houses designed by George Franklin Barber, as well as a 1915 house designed by Barry Byrne, who trained under Frank Lloyd Wright. A 1930s bank building was designed in the Streamline Moderne style. Commercial and institutional architecture were influenced by the Louden Industries, including the Louden Foundry. Fairfield is the site of the prototype Carnegie library. 

In 1892, Senator &quot;Jefferson Jim&quot; Wilson met with Andrew Carnegie and secured a grant to build the first community-based library in the U.S. This served as the model for 2,700 libraries worldwide. The Richardsonian Romanesque work is now operated by Indian Hills Community College as a satellite campus building, as a new library was built in 1996.

Parsons College later received a grant to build a Carnegie Library. Fairfield became one of the few cities that had two Carnegie Libraries.

== Economy ==
According to an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the city &quot;thrives largely on its abundance of start-up companies&quot;. Members of the community have established over 400 businesses in areas such as software, manufacturing, and trading. The Agri-Industrial Products company was founded in 1978 and became one of the nation&#x27;s largest manufacturers of construction warning barrels and other products made of plastic. The city is also home to Creative Edge, a ceramic tile manufacturer.

In 1990, Iowa Governor Terry Branstad called the city &quot;one of the state&#x27;s economic superstars&quot;. A 1997 report said the city had a significant number of entrepreneur businesses including a tofu company, several software firms, a chimney supplies wholesaler, wholefoods grocery store, an oil brokerage, and a telecommunications company. These new companies were reported in 1999 to have &quot;created up to 1,500 jobs in high tech businesses ranging from telecommunications companies to Internet providers to PC-oriented magazines&quot;. Later, the city was dubbed &quot;Silicorn Valley&quot; because of the preponderance of new businesses that were Internet and information based, founded by practitioners of the Transcendental Meditation technique.

In the 1990s, Fairfield had an average of $10 million in new construction each year. Some of the construction was in the Maharishi Sthapatya Veda style of architecture and included entrances that face either due east or due north, causing some businesses and homeowners to close their south and west facing entrances. Eco friendly subdivisions that border Fairfield and also use the architectural principles of Maharishi Sthapatya Veda include Cypress Villages, a development north of the city, and Abundance Ecovillage, an off-the-grid community of 14 homes built in three clusters north of Fairfield. The first LEED Platinum home in the state of Iowa was built nearby in the Cypress Villages Subdivision. Cypress Villages applied to the state for incorporation as it could not be annexed into either Fairfield or Maharishi Vedic City. That request was denied until such time as more services could be offered by the community. In addition, nearby Maharishi Vedic City, located two miles (3 km) north of Fairfield, began as a subdivision and incorporated as a city in 2001. The city sponsors an annual Eco-Fair and has more solar energy homes and green building than any other city in Iowa.

In 2003, a report by the National Center for Small Communities selected Fairfield as a recipient of The Grassroots Rural Entrepreneurship Award, saying that the city &quot;has become recognized as one [of] the nation&#x27;s most entrepreneurial small towns.&quot; The report said that Fairfield had created over 2,000 jobs in the previous 15 years and that new construction averages $10 million per year. That same year, it received the Community Vitality Center&#x27;s Entrepreneurial Community of the Year award. According to City officials, Fairfield received investments of over $200 million in venture capital from approximately 1990 to 2004. A 2004 National Public Radio report said that over the past 20 years &quot;TM proponents&quot; had created thousands of jobs and more than 200 businesses.

In 2008, the city was the &quot;home of 40 software development and telecom companies&quot; and according to a 2009 report from the University of Iowa&#x27;s Community Vitality Center, Fairfield has had more than $250 million invested across 50 different companies since 1990. These companies have included various financial services as well as those in marketing, software and telecom. This has created 3000 local jobs, plus &quot;12,000 jobs globally, and nearly $1 billion in new equity&quot;.

In 2009, the Fairfield Entrepreneurs Association (FEA) celebrated its 20th year. In 2011, the FEA published the Fairifield Edge magazine that contains profiles of over 40 businesses and organizations and describes the entrepreneurial culture of Fairfield and &quot;asset quilting&quot; to support civic and social entrepreneurship. In 2003, the city began hosting National Rural Entrepreneurial Gatherings, which are now called the FRED Conference (Focus on Rural Entrepreneurial Development). An article in the IEDC Economic Development Journal described Fairfield as a Rural Renaissance City because of its entrepreneurial population.

A 2011 article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; reported that newcomers to the town had founded more than 400 new businesses in the fields of marketing, computer programming and manufacturing, including 40 telecom and software companies. The city&#x27;s largest employer was reported to be the national broker/dealer services firm called Cambridge Investment Research, with about 400 local employees.

==Arts and culture==
A library was established in Fairfield in 1853 and was the first library in the state of Iowa. It was first housed in a rented room off the city square. 
Fairfield&#x27;s library became the first Carnegie Library outside of Pennsylvania or Scotland funded by Andrew Carnegie, who donated $40,000 to build the library. The Carnegie building on the corner of Washington and Court streets became the library&#x27;s home on November 28, 1893. Then in May 1996, the library moved to its present location on West Adams Street. The library has over 220,000 items and received accreditation from the State Library of Iowa in 2009.

Fairfield is home to the Fairfield Arts &amp; Convention Center (FACC), a building that cost $6 million to build. The complex consists of a 522-seat proscenium theatre, a business pavilion, meeting rooms, executive conference suite, art gallery, commercial kitchen, offices and outdoor plaza. The convention center features of exhibition space and of meeting space. The facility opened on December 7, 2007, with a theater named the Stephen Sondheim Center for the Performing Arts, after the American composer, Stephen Sondheim.
As the first theater named after Sondheim, its opening production included seven Broadway actors connected with Sondheim&#x27;s plays. In May 2010, the FACC facility became &quot;essentially&quot; city-owned, following a citywide vote.

On the first Friday night of every month, Fairfield hosts the 1st Fridays Art Walk, which attracts more than 2,500 visitors and showcases local and national artists in downtown galleries and occasional live, outdoor music.

In 2009, a concert by The Beach Boys and The Nadas was held on the Fairfield Middle School grounds, as a benefit for the FACC and the city&#x27;s Green Sustainability Plan. The concert was sponsored by the David Lynch Foundation. This was the 40th and final performance of The Beach Boys&#x27; summer tour of 2009. Fairfield was selected by the Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs to be one of six Iowa Great Places to participate in new program to revitalize the cultural arts in 2010.

Fairfield has been described as an &quot;international center&quot; for Transcendental Meditation; a &quot;national magnet&quot; and &quot;the world&#x27;s largest training center&quot; for practitioners of the Transcendental Meditation technique. Many of its current residents moved there to participate in the group practice of the TM and TM-Sidhi program inside one of the two Golden Domes built in 1981 and 1982 on the Maharishi International University campus. Locally, TM practitioners are sometimes called &quot;roos&quot;, slang for gurus, a term they have appropriated, although they &quot;refer to themselves as meditators&quot;. Fairfield natives are sometimes known as &quot;townies&quot;. Yogic Flyers living in Fairfield who are not part of the university are said to be members of the &quot;Town Super Radiance&quot; (TSR) community. In 2004, National Public Radio reported that &quot;after 30 years, many in Iowa are comfortable with Fairfield&#x27;s TM community&quot; and a 2008 article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; said &quot;natives lived uneasily with the outsiders...but the election of Mr. Malloy [in 2001]... helped ease those tensions&quot;.

Author Jack Forem wrote in 2012 that Fairfield is home to one of the largest synagogues in Iowa and one of the largest Liberal Catholic Churches in the nation. That year Oprah Winfrey visited Fairfield to interview citizens and was given a tour the town. An account of her visit titled &quot;America&#x27;s Most Unusual Town&quot;, was broadcast in March 2012 via the Oprah Winfrey Network.

Some of the trail is paved, five miles (8 km) of the trail is covered with lime chips, while other areas include traditional wooded paths. The trail system connects several areas of interest, including the Neff Family Wetlands dike, and the BNSF Trail segment, which crosses a new bridge that joins Walton Lake with Chautauqua Park. The final trail plan includes a &quot;heritage path&quot; leading to historical sites and a water trail that connects the area&#x27;s river and three lakes. In 2012, Fairfield was selected &quot;as one of ten finalists&quot; in the Blue Zones community &quot;small city category&quot; primarily because of its &quot;many walking trails and outdoor activities&quot;.

Fairfield&#x27;s grassroots efforts to create a sustainable community that focuses on reducing energy and protecting resources have been supported by a position created by Iowa State University extension services and the City of Fairfield.

Former Mayor Malloy described the city&#x27;s agenda for sustainability as aggressive, and includes a Green Strategic Plan covering everything from conservation, local farms, local food, alternative transportation, and bike paths and trails. In 2009 the city qualified for an $80,000 grant from the state Office of Energy Independence as funding for a sustainability plan scheduled to be completed in 2020. The city was one of 21 locations to receive the state Governor&#x27;s Environmental Excellence Award in 2013 after it reduced its energy consumption by more than 8% in one year.

<text>Coralville is a city in Johnson County, Iowa, United States. It is a suburb of Iowa City and part of the Iowa City Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 22,318 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Coralville is the location of the Edgewater Park Site, a 3,800-year-old archaeological site along the Iowa River. Edgewater is the oldest site in Iowa with evidence of domesticated plant use.

Coralville incorporated as a city on June 1, 1857. The city&#x27;s name is derived from the fossils that are found in the limestone along the Iowa River. In 1864, Louis Agassiz, a Harvard University zoologist, gave a lecture at the nearby University of Iowa titled &quot;The Coral Reefs of Iowa City&quot;. During the lecture, he presented local samples of fossilized Devonian period coral. The lecture was well received and helped raise public interest in the local fossils. In 1866, more corals were discovered at the site of a new mill, inspiring the citizens of the area to name the settlement &quot;Coralville&quot;. The first mill at Coralville was built in 1844, and in the years that followed, a number of watermills were powered by the Coralville mill dam along the Iowa River, but all of the mills had closed by 1900, except for a low-head hydroelectric plant that remained in operation until the mid 20th century.

Coralville is also the location where some 1300 Mormon immigrants stopped to make camp in their migration of 1856 after having traveled west by rail to Iowa City, which was the westernmost rail terminus at the time. They built handcarts out of native woods during their encampment so that an adult could haul a 600–700 pound load and cover about 15 miles per day on foot in their continuing trek to Salt Lake City. A historical marker commemorating the Mormon Handcart Brigade was erected in 1936 by the Iowa Society DAR, with members of the Pilgrim Chapter present. Originally placed just south of 5th Street and west of 10th Street, it was moved in 1998 to S. T. Morrison Park and rededicated by the Nathaniel Fellows Chapter, placed near the entrance and pond. Today, the Mormon Handcart Park and Nature Preserve commemorates the site. There is also a street, Mormon Trek Blvd, named for the Mormons who went through that area.

After World War II, Coralville began to grow as many university students began to make their homes there. It had only 433 people in 1940, but by 1970 Coralville&#x27;s population had jumped to 6,130. The construction of Interstate 80 in the 1960s brought several motels, fast-food restaurants, and gas stations to Coralville.

By the mid-1960s, the independent school district of Coralville was annexed by the Iowa City Community School District. Junior and senior high school students rode buses into Iowa City. Elementary (K-6) students attended Central Elementary School. Kirkwood Elementary school was opened in the fall of 1964, giving the growing town its second school. By the fall of 1968, all high school students from Coralville began attending the newly opened West High School. In 1971, the district built Northwest Junior High on property just to the south of Kirkwood Elementary, which then began handling seventh and eighth graders who lived west of the Iowa River. In 1997, Wickham Elementary School was opened.
In 1958, the United States Army Corps of Engineers completed Coralville Dam along the Iowa River, four miles (6 km) north of the city, creating Coralville Lake. Except for the Great Flood of 1993 and the Great Iowa flood of 2008, the dam has helped prevent serious flooding in the city. From June through August 1993, all three of Coralville&#x27;s main transportation links with Iowa City were submerged. The economic impact that year was severe, but the city had almost fully recovered within two years. The 2008 flood proved to be more costly as the Iowa River surpassed the 1993 record crest at over .

The First Methodist Church was built in 1963 to the designs by architect Thomas Patrick Reilly of Crites &amp; McConnell, 860 17th Street S.E. of Cedar Rapids.

On July 29, 1998, the Coral Ridge Mall opened with more than 100 stores, then the largest shopping center in the state. Around that time a &quot;city center&quot; area was created along the U.S. Route 6 &quot;strip&quot; near its intersection with 12th Avenue. Coral Ridge Mall&#x27;s opening would usher in a new era of retail development as big box stores opened in the area surrounding the mall. This has helped boost taxable sales in Coralville from $155.3 million in 1996 to $549.7 million in 2006.

Xtream Arena, a 5,100-seat venue, opened in 2020 in the city&#x27;s Iowa River Landing neighborhood. Xtream Arena is home to the Iowa Heartlanders, an ECHL professional hockey team, affiliates of the Minnesota Wild and Iowa Wild, and the Coralville Chaos of American Indoor Football.

<text>Iowa City is the county seat and largest city of Johnson County, Iowa, United States. At the time of the 2020 census the population was 74,828, making it the state&#x27;s fifth-most populous city. The Iowa City metropolitan area, which encompasses Johnson and Washington counties, has a population of over 171,000. The metro area is also a part of a combined statistical area with the Cedar Rapids metro area known as the Iowa City-Cedar Rapids region which collectively has a population of nearly 500,000.

Iowa City is the home of the University of Iowa. It was the second capital of the Iowa Territory and the first capital city of the State of Iowa; the Old Capitol building is a National Historic Landmark in the center of the University of Iowa campus. The University of Iowa Art Museum and Plum Grove, the home of the first governor of Iowa, are also tourist attractions.

== History ==
Iowa City was created by an act of Legislative Assembly of the Iowa Territory on January 21, 1839, fulfilling the desire of Governor Robert Lucas to move the capital out of Burlington and closer to the center of the territory. This act began:

An Act to locate the Seat of Government of the Territory of Iowa ... so soon as the place shall be selected, and the consent of the United States obtained, the commissioners shall proceed to lay out a town to be called &quot;Iowa City&quot;.

Commissioners Chauncey Swan and John Ronalds met on May 1 in the small settlement of Napoleon, south of present-day Iowa City, to select a site for the new capital city. The following day the commissioners selected a site on bluffs above the Iowa River north of Napoleon, placed a stake in the center of the proposed site and began planning the new capital city. Commissioner Swan, in a report to the legislature in Burlington, described the site:

Iowa City is located on a section of land laying in the form of an amphitheater. There is an eminence on the west near the river, running parallel with it.&quot; 

By June of that year, the town had been platted and surveyed from Brown St. in the north to Burlington St. in the south, and from the Iowa River eastward to Governor St.

While Iowa City was selected as the territorial capital in 1839, it did not officially become the capital city until 1841; after construction on the capitol building had begun. The capitol building was completed in 1842, and the last four territorial legislatures and the first six Iowa General Assemblies met there until 1857, when the state capital was moved to Des Moines.

===Iowa Old Capitol Building===
John F. Rague is credited with designing the Territorial Capitol Building. He had previously designed the 1837 capitol of Illinois and was supervising its construction when he got the commission to design the new Iowa capitol in 1839. He quit the Iowa project after five months, claiming his design was not followed, but the resemblance to the Illinois capitol suggests he strongly influenced the final Iowa design. One surviving 1839 sketch of the proposed capital shows a radically different layout, with two domes and a central tower. The cornerstone of the Old Capitol Building was laid in Iowa City on July 4, 1840. Iowa City served as the third and last territorial capital of Iowa, and the last four territorial legislatures met at the Old Capitol Building until December 28, 1846, when Iowa was admitted into the United States as the 29th state of the union. Iowa City was declared the state capital of Iowa, and the government convened in the Old Capitol Building.

===1843 cemetery===
Oakland Cemetery was deeded to &quot;the people of Iowa City&quot; by the Iowa territorial legislature on February 13, 1843. The original plot was one block square, with the southwest corner at Governor and Church. Over the years the cemetery has been expanded and now encompasses . Oakland Cemetery is a non-perpetual care city cemetery. This cemetery is supported by city taxes. The staff is strongly committed to the maintenance and preservation of privately owned lots and accessories. Since its establishment, the cemetery has become the final resting place of many men and women important in the history of Iowa, of Iowa City and the University of Iowa. These include Robert E. Lucas, first governor of the territory (1838–41); Samuel J. Kirkwood, governor during the Civil War (1860–64), again in 1876, a U.S. senator in 1877, and subsequently secretary of the interior and U.S. minister to Spain; well-known presidents of the university, Walter A. Jessup (1915–33) and Virgil M. Hancher (1940–64); Cordelia Swan, daughter of one of the three commissioners who selected the site for Iowa City and the new territorial capitol; and Irving B. Weber (1900–1997), noted Iowa City historian. It is also home to the legendary monument called the &quot;Black Angel&quot;, which is an tall monument for the Feldevert family erected in 1912. The facts behind the Black Angel long ago gave way to myths, superstitions and legend surrounding its mysterious change in color from a golden bronze cast to an eerie black.

===1847 University founding===
Founded in 1847, today&#x27;s University of Iowa offers more than 100 areas of study to 31,112 students. The university includes a medical school and one of the United States&#x27; largest university-owned teaching hospitals, providing patient care within 16 medical specialties. The University of Iowa College of Law is located there.

===1970 riots===
The spring of 1970 was a tumultuous time on college campuses. On April 30, President Richard Nixon announced that U.S. forces would invade Cambodia because of the recent communist coup. Students around the country protested this escalation of the Vietnam War. On May 4, the National Guard fired on students at Kent State University, killing four and wounding nine people, which ignited protests all over the country.

Anti-war protests were not new to Iowa City or to elsewhere in Iowa; protests had been occurring throughout the 1960s. Spring of 1970 was different.

After the Kent State shootings, students marched on the National Guard Armory, broke windows there as well as in some downtown businesses. The City Council gave the mayor curfew powers. On May 6, there was a student boycott of classes. That night, about 400 people had a &quot;sleep-in&quot; in front of the Old Capitol. That night also, about 50 people broke into the Old Capitol and set off a smoke bomb. The protesters left voluntarily when asked to do so. Around 2 am Friday morning, President Boyd requested arrest of the students on the Pentacrest by highway patrolmen, but the next day he regretted the mass arrests and said he had received faulty information. On May 8, President Boyd cancelled the 89th annual Governor&#x27;s day ROTC observance for the following day. On Friday and Saturday a National Guard helicopter circled the Pentacrest.

In the early morning hours of Saturday, May 9, the Old Armory Temporary (O.A.T.), also known as &quot;Big Pink&quot;, which housed the writing lab, was burned down. This building was located next to the Old Armory, where the Adler Journalism and Mass Communications building currently is located. O.A.T was said to be at the top of a list of buildings for burning, probably due to its poor condition and was considered a firetrap.

The &quot;Iowa Alumni Review&quot; includes an article about the fire in which the author states: &quot;Only the ends stayed upright. ... On the south, Lou Kelly&#x27;s Writing lab bearing the sign &#x27;another mother for peace,&#x27; escaped.&quot; There was a second, smaller fire on Saturday evening in a restroom in the East Hall Annex.

By Sunday morning, President Boyd gave students the option to leave. Classes were not cancelled but students could leave and take the grade they currently had. An account of the May 1970 protests can be read in the June–July issue of the &quot;Iowa Alumni Review&quot;.

In his autobiography, &quot;My Iowa Journey: The Life Story of the University of Iowa&#x27;s First African American Professor&quot;, Philip Hubbard (University Vice-Provost in 1970) gives an administrator&#x27;s perspective of all the protests of the 1960s. He supported the students&#x27; right to protest and in 1966 stated:
&quot;Students should not accept everything that is dished out to them. We don&#x27;t want to dictate what they should or should not do. However, student demonstrations should remain within the law and good taste without interfering with the university&#x27;s primary purpose of instructing students.&quot;

During this time, there was also a strong ROTC presence on campus. Their presence on campus and the academic credit they received for their service was called into question by both students and faculty in the spring of 1970, but Boyd said he could not abolish ROTC. The &quot;Alumni Review&quot; had an article called &quot;ROTC: Alive and well at Iowa&quot; in the December 1969 issue which helps provide a more complete picture of this period in history.

=== 2006 tornadoes ===
On the evening of April 13, 2006, a confirmed EF2 tornado struck Iowa City, causing severe property damage and displacing many from their homes, including many University of Iowa students. It was the first tornado ever recorded to hit the city directly. No serious injuries were reported in the Iowa City area.

Several businesses along Riverside Drive and Iowa Highway 1 were destroyed. The 134-year-old Saint Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church was heavily damaged only minutes after Holy Thursday Mass, with most of its roof destroyed. The building was ruled a total loss and has since been demolished. The downtown business district as well as the eastern residential area and several parks suffered scattered damage of varying degrees.

Additionally, several houses in the sorority row area were destroyed. The Alpha Chi Omega house was nearly destroyed, though no one was injured. The building was later razed. Cleanup efforts were under way almost immediately as local law enforcement, volunteer workers from all over the state, and Iowa City residents and college students worked together to restore the city. The total cost of damage was estimated at $12 million–$4 million of which was attributed to Iowa City and Johnson County property.

=== 2008 flood ===
A local newspaper reported on June 11, 2008, that water exceeded the emergency spillway at the Coralville Reservoir outside of Iowa City. As a result, the City of Iowa City and the University of Iowa were seriously affected by unprecedented flooding of the Iowa River, which caused widespread property damage and forced evacuations in large sections of the city. By Friday, June 13, 2008, the Iowa River had risen to a record level of (5:00 pm CST) with a crest of approximately predicted for Wednesday, June 18, 2008. Much of the city&#x27;s 500-year floodplain saw mild to catastrophic effects of the rapidly flowing, polluted water. Officials at the University of Iowa reported that up to 19 buildings were affected by rising waters. Extensive efforts to move materials from the university&#x27;s main library were undertaken as large groups of sandbagging volunteers began to construct a massive levee near the building. Approximately $300 million worth of art, including work by Picasso, owned by the university was secretly moved to a holding place in the Chicago area before the fine arts area was heavily hit with flood water.

On Friday, June 13, university employees were encouraged to stay home, and travel was strongly discouraged in Iowa City; one city statement advised, &quot;If you live in east Iowa City, stay in east Iowa City; if you live in west Iowa City, stay in west Iowa City.&quot; The Burlington St. bridge was the only bridge that remained open, other than the I-80 bridge on the edge of town, to connect the east and west sides of the Iowa River. On Saturday, June 14, officials at the University of Iowa began to power down the university&#x27;s primary power generating plant along the Iowa River to prevent structural damage. Backup units continued to provide necessary power and steam services for essential University services, including the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. Water began touching the bottom of the Park St. bridge forcing the Army Corps of Engineers to drill several holes in the bridge to allow air trapped underneath to escape. Also on Saturday, Mayor Regenia Bailey issued a curfew restricting anyone except those authorized by law enforcement from being within of any area affected by the flood between 8:30 pm and 6 am.

<text>Lone Tree is a city in southeastern Johnson County, Iowa, United States. It is part of the Iowa City, Iowa Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,357 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Lone Tree was platted by John W. Jayne in 1872. Lone Tree derives its name from a giant elm that grew nearby in the pioneer era and served as a prairie landmark. This elm stood on a slight hill south of town. Local legend has it that the tree was so large, buffalo grazed under its expansive branches. It escaped prairie fires because of the lack of grass around the tree. The tree succumbed to the Dutch Elm disease of the 1960s, although valiant efforts were made to save it. The wood from the tree was used to make a sign denoting the tree&#x27;s home on the hill southeast of the city limits.

On December 9, 1985, during the 1980s farm crisis, a local farmer, Dale Burr, became distraught over his growing debt. He shot his wife Emily in their home. He then went to Hills Bank &amp; Trust in the neighboring town of Hills and attempted to cash a check and when rebuffed, returned with a shotgun and killed bank president John Hughes. Next on his list was his neighbor Richard Goody, who had recently won a court settlement against Burr&#x27;s son. When pulled over by Johnson County sheriffs, Burr shot himself fatally. Burr had left a note beside his wife&#x27;s body. It said he &quot;couldn&#x27;t manage his problems anymore.&quot; The story was captured in Bruce Brown&#x27;s book &quot;Lone Tree&quot;.

==History==
The North Liberty area was first settled in 1838 by John Gaylor and Alonzo C. Dennison. It was originally known as &quot;Big Bottom&quot; or &quot;North Bend&quot; (in reference to its location near the bend of the Iowa River) by its earliest settlers and was later known as &quot;Squash Bend&quot; before the city was platted as North Liberty in 1857.

North Liberty incorporated on November 10, 1913, at which time its population was approximately 190.
Population growth accelerated in the 1960s, and the Iowa City Community School District opened Penn Elementary there in 1961. A 1967 special census placed the city&#x27;s population at 782, and by 1980 the population had grown to over 2,000. In 1984, in response to the population growth, the North Liberty Community Library was founded, and Penn Meadows Park, the city&#x27;s largest, was opened. By 2000, the population of the city was over 5,000. The city had established its own police and fire departments and built a community center with library and aquatic park, as well as a city administration building. The city has since continued to grow, with a population of 7,224 in a 2004 special census. In 2007, the population was estimated to be 10,982, making North Liberty the second fastest-growing city in Iowa.

==Government==

Swisher operates under the mayor-council form of government. The city council consists of five members, elected at large for overlapping four-year terms, and is presided over by a popularly elected mayor, who also serves a four-year term.

===Resignation of mayor and city clerk===

At a regularly scheduled city council meeting on November 11, 2013, City Clerk Connie Meier and Mayor Tim Mason resigned suddenly, effectively leaving Swisher without any administrative staff.

A video of the meeting released to news outlets showed Mason and Meier engaged in an argument with council member Angie Hinrichs over a letter sent to the council from an appointed city official. In the video, Hinrichs repeatedly accused Meier of improperly sharing the letter with a local developer. In response, Meier explained that except for personnel records, all documents in the city&#x27;s custody are a matter of public record and copies must be given to anyone who asks for them. When Mason tried to come to Meier&#x27;s defense, Hinrichs threatened to contact the city attorney independently, stating &quot;I just want it on the record that I did not give this because if there&#x27;s any consequences that come back to the city council, I did not give this to them.&quot; It was at this point that Meier left the room. Mason called for a recess and went to speak with Meier. When he returned, he told the council that she had quit and that he too was resigning.

The resignations occurred six days after Hinrichs and another council member, Larry Svec, were re-elected to additional four-year terms.

With the mayor&#x27;s seat open, Mayor Pro-Tem Mary Gudenkauf assumed the mayoral duties of the city, as well as those of the city clerk. Gudenkauf would continue to serve as acting mayor until a special election was held in February 2014.

Meier would later release a statement which read, in part, &quot;Unfortunately, a couple of council members had made working conditions detrimental to me, making me feel uncomfortable and unsafe. Staying in my position would have enabled these two individuals to continue to treat me in an unacceptable manner.&quot;

===2014 special election===

A special election was held on February 4, 2014, to fill the mayor&#x27;s seat for the remainder of Tim Mason&#x27;s term. Christopher J. Taylor, who had run for city council against Angie Hinrichs and Larry Svec in the fall, won the election against long-time Planning and Zoning Commission chairman Randy Hurlbert by a vote of 151 to 136.

Voter turnout was the highest ever recorded for an election in Swisher, with 48.2% of registered voters casting ballots. Taylor received the second highest number of votes ever cast for a Swisher mayor, after Scott Grabe received 158 in 2007. Grabe ran unopposed in that election.

Taylor took office nine days after the election, on February 13, to serve out the term expiring December 31, 2015. Taylor ran for and won re-election to a full, 4-year term in November 2015. He was unopposed in that election.

<text>University Heights is a city in Johnson County, Iowa, United States. It is part of the Iowa City, Iowa Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,228 at the time of the 2020 census. It is an enclave surrounded by Iowa City, located near the campus of the University of Iowa. The University Heights city border is approximately 0.1 miles from Kinnick Stadium.

According to &quot;The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)&quot;, University Heights has a reputation among area motorists as a speed trap.

==History==

At the turn of the 20th century, the area of present-day University Heights was known as West Lucas Township and consisted of several small farms and properties. At that time, the University of Iowa and Iowa City at large had not yet expanded westward past the Iowa River.

In the early 1920s, brothers Lee and George Koser began purchasing and developing the land that became the city of University Heights, anticipating the westward expansion of the University and the city. With the construction of the University&#x27;s General Hospital in 1928 and Kinnick Stadium in 1929, those predictions came true. By 1933, the City of Iowa City began annexing land on the west side of the river and in 1935, the city of University Heights was incorporated. By the 1960s, most of the remaining lots west of Sunset St. were developed and the land surrounding University Heights had been annexed by Iowa City, limiting future growth.

All 241 lots in the original subdivisions of University Heights were set up with restrictive covenants stating that the lots were &quot;for the sole use and benefit of the Caucasian Race and no lot or parcel shall be sold, owned, or used or occupied by the people of any other race, except when used in the capacity of a servant or helper&quot;. For 218 of the lots, Lee, Reka, George, and Tessie Koser were responsible for the language, while for the remaining 23, L.R. and Elizabeth Leamer were responsible. These racially restrictive covenants were legally enforceable until the Shelley vs. Kraemer US Supreme Court decision in 1948.

In 2009, the developer Jeff Maxwell proposed a large development to be built on the present site of St. Andrew Presbyterian Church. The proposal was considered by the zoning commission and disapproved. It was sent to the city council which also disapproved the proposed rezoning. The 2009 city election reflected the high level of interest in the development as ten candidates ran for the city council and voters turned out in record numbers.

Four of the five council members elected subsequently supported the Maxwell development. One of them, Amy Moore, resigned from the city council and was replaced by Jim Lane by appointment. A petition for a special election obtained more than the minimum signatures. The two candidates in the January 11th election were Jim Lane, the appointed incumbent, and Rosanne Hopson, a longtime resident.

The final turnout of 495 set a record for city elections in University Heights. Hopson received 262 votes (53%) and Lane received 233 (47%).

<text>Anamosa is a city in Jones County, Iowa, United States. The population was 5,450 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Jones County.

==History==
What is now Anamosa was founded as the settlement of Buffalo Forks in 1838 and incorporated as Lexington in 
1856. Lexington was a popular name for towns at that time, so when Lexington chose to become incorporated as a city in 1877, the name was changed to Anamosa to avoid mail delivery confusion. There are many stories on how Anamosa was chosen as a name. Some believe it was named for a local Native American girl named Anamosa, meaning &quot;white fawn&quot;, while others say it means &quot;You walk with me.&quot;

The romantic origin of the naming of the town of Anamosa comes from its early history. A Native American family was passing through town in 1842. The family stayed at the Ford House. The little girl, a Native American Princess, named Anamosa, endeared herself to the townspeople and following the family&#x27;s departure from town, local citizens decided to name their town after her.

The Wapsipinicon River flows through Anamosa. According to legend, a Native American maiden and her lover threw themselves off a bluff overlooking the Wapsipinicon River; one was named Wapsi, the other Pinicon. Origins of this legend are unconfirmed.

Anamosa was named the Pumpkin Capital of Iowa by the Iowa State Legislature in 1993 and hosts Pumpkinfest, a pumpkin festival and weigh-off, each October.

The Anamosa Boot Hill Cemetery is still open today and is northwest of the town.

== Landmarks and industry ==

Anamosa is home to the Anamosa State Penitentiary, formerly known as the Iowa Men&#x27;s Reformatory, a medium/maximum security prison that is the largest in Iowa, housing over 1,200 male inmates. Anamosa State Penitentiary was home to infamous criminal John Wayne Gacy as well as Robert Hansen, the inspiration for the movie &quot;Frozen Ground&quot;. It was established in 1872 and constructed from locally quarried Anamosa Limestone in the style of a castle, inspiring its nickname as &quot;The White Palace of the West&quot;. The prison grounds also house the Anamosa State Penitenitiary Museum, which contains artifacts and exhibits on prison life from throughout its history.

Motorcycles have been a common sight in Anamosa. Anamosa was home to J&amp;P Cycles, a supplier of aftermarket motorcycle parts and accessories, until its last operations in town closed at the end of 2023 and was home to the National Motorcycle Museum, until its closing in September 2023. The museum had over 300 vintage motorcycles, including a replica of the &quot;Captain America bike&quot; from the movie &quot;Easy Rider&quot;.

Anamosa was the birthplace and burial place of the regionalist artist Grant Wood; he is buried in Riverside Cemetery, next to a large monument of a recumbent lion. Visitors can view a collection of satirical interpretations of his most famous work &quot;American Gothic&quot; at the Grant Wood Art Gallery on Main Street.

The unincorporated town of Stone City is a few miles northwest of Anamosa and was the location for some of Grant Wood&#x27;s paintings. Historic buildings built of local stone are still standing. The quarry that supplied the limestone still exists today as Weber Stone Company.

Wapsipinicon State Park is on the southwest edge of the city. The Hale Bridge is inside the park. The Iowa Army National Guard flew the three spans of the Hale Bridge from the Olin/Hale staging areas to the new home across the Wapsipinicon River at Wapsipinicon State Park by helicopter.

== Education ==
Anamosa Community School District operates schools serving this community.

Additionally St. Patrick School, of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dubuque, is in Anamosa. The school opened in 1944.

==Redistricting==
Controversy arose in Anamosa in the 2000s over the redistricting of election wards in the city. Because the boundaries of the city&#x27;s four wards were drawn to encompass equal numbers of residents, and because the inmates of the Anamosa State Penitentiary — who are ineligible to vote — were counted among the population of the second ward, the voting population of the second ward was significantly smaller than that of any of the other three wards. Consequently, the power of each vote in the second ward was much greater than the power of a vote in any of the city&#x27;s other wards. In 2007, city residents voted to end the system of wards; since 2008, all city council elections have been at-large.

<text>Hedrick is a city in Keokuk County, Iowa, United States. The population was 728 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1882, the Burlington and Western Railway a narrow gauge line, and its competitor, the Iowa Central Railway, built competing east–west lines through the area. These crossed the Rock Island tracks here, so it was a natural location for a station and town.

Hedrick was incorporated on April 23, 1883. It was named for General Hedrick.

The Burlington and Western was widened to standard gauge in 1902 and merged into the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy a year later. The Minneapolis and St. Louis took over the Iowa Central around the same time, and the Burlington line was abandoned in 1934.

By 1991 several businesses in the community&#x27;s main street closed, and the economy had declined. The school serving the town closed that year.

In 2023, the city was struck by an EF-4 rated tornado.

<text>What Cheer () is a city in Keokuk County, Iowa, United States. It is a former coal town, and from the 1870s to the early 1900s was one of the major coal-producing centers of Iowa. Its greatest recorded population was 3,246, in the 1890 census. The population was 607 in the 2020 census.

==Naming==
What Cheer was founded in 1865 as Petersburg, named after Peter Britton, its founder. This name was rejected by the Post Office, forcing a change of name. Joseph Andrews, a major and veteran of the American Civil War, suggested the name &quot;What Cheer,&quot; and the town was officially renamed on December 1, 1879.

Sources differ as to why the name What Cheer was chosen. The phrase &quot;what cheer with you&quot; is an ancient English greeting dating back at least to the 15th century. One theory of the name is that a Scottish miner exclaimed &quot;What cheer!&quot; on discovering a coal seam near town.

A more elaborate theory suggests that Joseph Andrews chose the name because of one of the founding myths of his native town of Providence, Rhode Island. According to the story, when Roger Williams arrived at the site that would become Providence in 1636, he was greeted by Narragansett Native Americans with &quot;What Cheer, &quot;Netop&quot;&quot;. &quot;Netop&quot; was the Narragansett word for &quot;friend&quot;, and the Narragansetts had picked up the &quot;what cheer&quot; greeting from English settlers. It is possible that the connection between What Cheer, Iowa and What Cheer, the shibboleth of Rhode Island, was merely coincidental - the entries for these subjects are adjacent but not connected in the 1908 edition of the Encyclopedia Americana.

What Cheer has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names.

==History==

Robert Forsyth, born in Kilmarnock, Scotland, came to America in 1857, and made his way to Rock Island, Illinois, where he arrived penniless. He worked for most of a decade as a coal miner before coming to Petersburg, the future What Cheer. In the 1870s, he began buying coal lands around town, mostly on credit. When the railroad came to town, he leased his land to the coal companies and bought into a local drug store, eventually operating stores in What Cheer, Mystic and Jerome, Iowa. Other Scots from the Kilmarnock region (Ayrshire) also settled in the area. Robert Orr came in 1875 after working in the coal mines of Colchester, Illinois. His son Alexander went on a successful career as a mine owner in Mystic.

The Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Northern Railway (BCR&amp;N) built a branch to What Cheer in 1879. With the arrival of the railroad, the What Cheer coalfield quickly became one of the most important coal mining centers in Iowa. The Starr Coal Company had over 200 employees and could produce 1,000 tons of coal per day. By 1883, they were operating three mines and took over several others. When, in 1884, the Chicago and North Western Railway built its line through What Cheer to Muchakinock, there was a further expansion of mining in the area.

Local Assembly 1474 of the Knights of Labor was based in What Cheer and had a membership of 65 in 1884. On Oct. 15, 1884, 500 miners in What Cheer went on strike, demanding higher wages. The established wage was 3 cents per bushel, and the miners demanded an additional half cent. The state militia was put on alert, but after 6 weeks, the miners accepted a quarter-cent raise. This strike cut coal production in the What Cheer significantly.

In 1886, the What Cheer Coal Company began to consolidate the local mines, buying up the Starr Coal Company and the Granger Coal Company. In 1887, they employed 1,100 miners, and they continued to operate until 1899. From 1885 to 1901, the Crescent Coal Company was an important local producer.

In 1891, the BCR&amp;N Railroad&#x27;s Iowa City Division, serving What Cheer, carried 38,080 tons of coal, by far the most important commodity carried by that line.
In 1892, mines along the BCR&amp;N (all of which were in the What Cheer region) loaded 129,316 tons of coal.

On May 1, 1891, the miners of What Cheer and many other mining towns went on strike for the eight-hour day. 1000 men walked off the job in What Cheer, but returned to work defeated on June 16. On August 15, 1896, the miners struck again over several small grievances. The strike lasted 10 to 12 weeks. Local 841 of the United Mine Workers union was organized in What Cheer in 1897, and in 1902, it had 200 members.

The first industrial development in What Cheer was driven by the needs of the coal mines. In 1890, What Cheer was home to three firms making mining drills, Walker &amp; Thompson, Enterprise Manufacturing and the newly formed What Cheer Drill Company. Within the decade, the What Cheer Drill and Miners&#x27; Tool Company was selling equipment in mining districts around the nation. Alexander Walker, originally with Walker &amp; Thompson filed numerous patents on mining equipment, most of which were assigned to the What Cheer Drill and Miners&#x27; Tool Company, later named the What Cheer Tool Company. In 1903, the Starr Manufacturing Company, American Mining Tool Company and the What Cheer Tool Company agreed to a union wage scale with the International Brotherhood of Blacksmiths. At the time, the blacksmiths local 259 had just 17 members.

In 1907, the Volunteer Brick and Tile company was operating its own coal mine to fuel its kilns. The mine had a steam hoist to lift coal 40 feet from a coal seam from 4 to 5 feet thick. The Lea Brothers&#x27; mine in north-central What Cheer also had a steam hoist and still shipped some coal by rail. The remaining mines in the area were all small, using horse-gins to operate their hoists.

By 1909, there were only a few mines left in the county, all producing coal for local consumption in What Cheer. The decline of What Cheer&#x27;s mines in the 20th century was reflected in declining union membership. In 1912, Local 841 of the United Mine Workers, based in What Cheer, had only 18 members.

The What Cheer Clay Products Company strip mined local coal into the mid-century, but in their case, coal was a byproduct. Their primary source of clay was the 8 to 12 foot (2.5 to 4 meter) underclay found immediately below the coal. What Cheer Clay Products was organized in 1911. The plant cost $300,000 to build, and was seriously damaged by a fire in 1917. Despite this, by 1920, the company was expanding, purchasing a new Dragline excavator in order to work their clay pit.

==Geography==
The central business district and the larger part of the town is located on the north-east bank of Coal Creek, a tributary of the North fork of the Skunk River.

<text>Algona is the county seat of Kossuth County, Iowa, United States. The population was 5,487 at the 2020 census. Ambrose A. Call State Park is located two miles southwest of the city.

==History==
Algona was founded in 1854 and was named after the Algonquian word for &quot;Algonquin waters&quot;.

Between 1869 and 1875 the community was the location of Algona College, an institution sponsored by the Methodist Church.

In 1894, Algona, along with other Iowa communities such as Dysart and Wesley, became part of the project known as the &quot;Orphan Trains&quot;. As New York City saw booming immigration, it also inevitably saw a rise in the number of orphans in its asylums. Unable to provide adequate care for them, it saw fit to ship nearly 100,000 westward to start a new life with families across America. Algona itself welcomed nearly 100 orphans into the town, many of whom remained lifelong residents.

From 1902 to 1906, Algona played host to the Algona Brownies, an African American barnstorming baseball team and interracial team the first two seasons. Despite being declared Western champions in 1903, the team disbanded as an interracial team that same year. The Algona Brownies were an independent interracial baseball team that played in the 1902 and 1903 seasons. They primarily made up of former members of the Chicago Unions, Columbia Giants, and Chicago Union Giants teams. After 1903, the team makeup changed from having both black and white players to a team of only black players. That year, their final year, they won the Western championship, defeating the Chicago Union Giants in a challenge playoff.

The Henry Adams Building, designed by Louis Sullivan in 1913 is located at the northwest corner of East State and Moore streets. Although not designed to be a bank, the building is nonetheless considered to be one of Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Jewel Boxes,&quot; a series of banks built in the Midwest from 1909 through 1919.

Algona was the location of a German prisoner of war camp during World War II. From 1943 to 1946 Camp Algona held nearly 10,000 prisoners, many of whom were put to work on farms that had family fighting overseas. As a main camp Algona had numerous sub-camps with a couple dozen in Minnesota. A museum now commemorates the camp&#x27;s history including a nativity scene created by the POWs.

A destructive F3 tornado killed two people and destroyed a large part of Algona on June 28, 1979, about 7:15 PM. The tornado moved in a south-southeast direction through Algona. Severe damage was done to the central business district and a number of homes were rendered uninhabitable. Near F4 damage was reported in some locations. There was about 15 minutes&#x27; warning and the tornado sirens were sounded well before the arrival of the tornado. The fact that it was still daylight also contributed to the relatively low death count from this destructive storm.

In 2003, Algona drew national attention when it announced the purchase of the world&#x27;s largest Cheetos puff. It was meant as a plan to bring tourism to the town to see the puff by a local radio DJ.

<text>Lakota is a city in Kossuth County, Iowa, United States. The population was 267 at the time of the 2020 census. Prior to 1919, the town was known as Germania.

==History==
The present town of Lakota was originally named Germania. The original town site of Germania was surveyed and filed for record by the Northern Iowa Land and Town Lot Company, August 26, 1892. The town received its name from the German heritage of many of the early settlers in the area. In 1918, the hysteria of World War I was sweeping the country. Residents couldn&#x27;t change their origin to protect themselves from the popular hatred of the time, but they could take the stigma of all things German from the town by wiping its name off the map, which they did. An election was held on October 1, 1918, to vote to change the name of Germania to Lakota. A canvas of the votes showed there were 48 yes and 32 no votes cast. Mayor J. Gus Thaves filed the certificate changing the name to Lakota at the Kossuth County Courthouse on October 16, 1918. However the name was not officially changed by the post office until August 5, 1919. The town was renamed Lakota, an Indian word with several different translations. Some say Lakota means &quot;beautiful prairie&quot; or as other translations say Lakota means &quot;plenty&quot;, others say it means &quot;allies&quot;.

==Geography==

<text>Fort Madison is a city and a county seat of Lee County, Iowa, United States along with Keokuk. Of Iowa&#x27;s 99 counties, Lee County is the only one with two county seats. The population was 10,270 at the time of the 2020 census. Located along the Mississippi River in the state&#x27;s southeast corner, it lies between small bluffs along one of the widest portions of the river.

==History==
Fort Madison was founded as the location of the first U.S. military fort in the upper Mississippi region. A replica of the fort stands along the river. Sheaffer Pens were developed and made in Fort Madison for many years. The city is the location of the Iowa State Penitentiary—the state&#x27;s maximum security prison for men. Fort Madison is the Mississippi river crossing and station stop for Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Southwest Chief&quot;. Fort Madison has one of two remaining double swing-span bridges on the Mississippi River, the Fort Madison Toll Bridge, the other being the Government Bridge in Rock Island, Illinois. It has a top level for cars and a similar level for trains; it is also the world&#x27;s largest .

The Fort Madison Downtown Commercial Historic District is a collection of well-preserved historic storefronts from the late 19th century. Along with this is the Park-to-Park Residential Historic District. The Historic Park to Park District is a seven block long, three block wide section of homes that represent the Gothic, Victorian, and Tudor era. With a rich variety of architectural styles like Gothic Revival, Italianate, Second Empire, Eastlake Stick, Richardson Romanesque, Queen Anne, and Tudor. With two of the six parks within the District. It is on the National Historic Registry.

===Original Fort Madison (1808–1813)===
The city of Fort Madison was established around the site of the historic Fort Madison (1808–1813), which was the first permanent U.S. military fortification on the Upper Mississippi. Fort Madison was the site of Black Hawk&#x27;s first battle against U.S. troops, the only real War of 1812 battle fought west of the Mississippi. It was also the location of the first U.S. military cemetery in the upper Midwest. The fort was named for James Madison, fourth President of the United States.

Fort Madison was one of three posts established by the U.S. Army to establish control over the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase territories. Fort Madison was built to control trade and pacify Native Americans in the Upper Mississippi River region. The other two posts were Fort Belle Fontaine near St. Louis, which controlled the mouth of the Missouri, and Fort Osage, near what is now Kansas City, which controlled trade with western Native American tribes.

====Location of the Fort====
A disputed 1804 treaty with the Sauk and affiliated tribes led to the U.S. claim of control over western Illinois and parts of what is now Iowa. To establish control, the U.S. Army set out to construct a post near the mouth of the Des Moines River, a major trading route into the interior of Iowa. Not finding suitable land near the mouth of the Des Moines, the expedition also considered land near Quashquame&#x27;s Sauk and Meskwaki village at the head of the Des Moines Rapids, a choke point of trade and transportation on the Upper Mississippi below modern Montrose. Again, this land was not considered suitable for a fort. The Army settled on a location several miles upstream at what is now the city of Fort Madison.

First called Fort Belleview, this post was also soon deemed inadequate. It was poorly situated at the base of a bluff next to a deep ravine, areas from which enemies could safely fire at the fort. Its construction led to resentment among the local Native Americans, especially the Sauk: They considered the 1804 treaty invalid, the fort threatened established trading networks, and American trade goods were considered inferior to French or British goods.

Black Hawk lamented over the new fort, and disparaged its construction in his autobiography.

====Attacks on Fort Madison====
Almost from the beginning, the fort was attacked by Sauk and other tribes. U.S. troops were harassed when they left the fort, and in April 1809, only threat of cannon fire stopped an attempted storming of the fort.

During its existence, several improvements were made to the fort, including reinforcing the stockade and making it higher, extending the fort to a nearby bluff to provide cover from below, and constructing of additional blockhouses outside the stockade. These improvements could not fully compensate for the fort&#x27;s poor location, however, and it was again attacked in March 1812, and was the focus of a coordinated siege in the following September. The September siege was intense, and the fort was nearly overrun. Significant damage resulted to fort-related buildings, and the attack was only stopped when cannon fire destroyed a fortified Indian position. Black Hawk participated in the siege, and claimed to have personally shot down the fort&#x27;s flag.

====Final siege and abandonment====
As the War of 1812 expanded to the frontier, British-allied Sauk and other tribes began a determined effort to push out the Americans and reclaim control of the upper Mississippi. Beginning in July 1813, attacks on troops outside the fort led to another siege. Conditions were so dangerous that the Army could not recover the bodies of soldiers killed outside the fort and troops could not leave the fort to collect firewood. The Army burned outbuildings to prevent them from falling into Indian hands.

After weeks of paralyzing siege, the Army finally abandoned the post, burning it as they evacuated. They retreated in the dark through a trench to the river, where they escaped on boats. The date of the abandonment is unknown, as much of the military correspondence from this period of the war is missing, but it probably happened in September. Black Hawk observed the ruins soon after. &quot;We started in canoes, and descended the Mississippi, until we arrived near the place where Fort Madison had stood. It had been abandoned and burned by the whites, and nothing remained but the chimneys. We were pleased to see that the white people had retired from the country.&quot;

United States government had established a federal fur trade station at Fort Madison in 1808. It was burned down in 1812 by order of the military commander who feared that it would endanger the fort.

Three active battalions of the current 3rd Infantry (1–3 Inf, 2–3 Inf and 4-3 Inf) perpetuate the lineage of the old 1st Infantry Regiment, which had a detachment at Fort Madison.

====Fort ruins and archaeology====
Early settlers built their homes near the ruins and named the town that grew up around them for the fort. A large monument was erected in the early 20th century at the fort location. Archaeological excavations in the parking lot of the Sheaffer Pen Company factory in 1965 exposed the fort&#x27;s central blockhouse and the foundations of officers&#x27; quarters. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. A replica fort was built several blocks away; much of the labor was supplied by volunteer inmates at the nearby Iowa State Penitentiary.

====Preservation and threats to the fort site====
The fort site is now the subject of preservation efforts. After the Sheaffer Pen factory closed in 2007, the site was sold to developers. Arguing that Fort Madison is &quot;Iowa&#x27;s most important historical site&quot;, preservationists want to convert the parking lot into a memorial park dedicated to soldiers killed at the fort. So far, no agreement has been reached for its preservation.

===Founding of the town of Fort Madison===
The first settler at the ruins of the fort was General John Holly Knapp, who in 1832 bought a claim to some land of the fort and built the first building in the fall of the same year, utilized as an Indian Supply Store. Early next spring and his cousin Nathaniel Knapp with family settled there, joined by some other settlers the same year, In June 1835, General Knapp and Nathaniel Knapp, laid out the town of Fort Madison. Due to some land title issues, in 1840 the town was relocated on the same lot lines by the government.

==Geography==

==Economy==
The town has more manufacturing jobs than population, which is rare—doubly rare because there are no other towns nearby to supply additional labor. There are a half-dozen plants that account for this, making plastic products, grain storage bins and ready-mix concrete. Houghton was once the junction of two rail lines, both now abandoned, which may have something to do with the origin of its industry. Nevertheless, St. Johns Catholic Church is the most substantial building in town.

<text>Keokuk is a city in and a county seat of Lee County, Iowa, United States. It is Iowa&#x27;s southernmost city. The population was 9,900 at the time of the 2020 census. The city is named after the Sauk chief Keokuk, who is recognized with a statue in Rand Park. It is in the extreme southeast corner of Iowa, where the Des Moines River meets the Mississippi. It is at the junction of U.S. Routes 61, 136 and 218. Just across the rivers are the towns of Hamilton and Warsaw, Illinois, and Alexandria, Missouri. Keokuk, along with the city of Fort Madison, is a principal city of the Fort Madison-Keokuk micropolitan area, which includes all of Lee County, Iowa, Hancock County, Illinois and Clark County, Missouri.

==History==

Situated between the Des Moines and Mississippi rivers, the area that became Keokuk had access to a large trading area and was an ideal location for settlers. In 1820, the US Army prohibited soldiers stationed along the Mississippi River from having wives who were Native American. Dr. Samuel C. Muir, a surgeon stationed at Fort Edwards (near present-day Warsaw, Illinois), resigned his commission rather than leave his Indian wife and crossed the river to resettle. He built a log cabin for them at the bottom of the bluff, and became the area&#x27;s first white settler. 
As steamboat traffic on the Mississippi increased, more European Americans began to settle here. Around 1827, John Jacob Astor established a post of his American Fur Company at the foot of the bluff. Five buildings were erected to house workers and the business. This area became known as the &quot;Rat Row&quot;.

One of the earliest descriptions of Keokuk was by Caleb Atwater in 1829:

The settlement was part of the land designated in 1824 as a Half-Breed Tract by the United States Government for allotting land to mixed-race descendants of the Sauk and Fox tribes. Typically children of European or British men (fur traders and trappers) and Native women, they were often excluded from tribal communal lands because their fathers were not tribal members. Native Americans considered the settlement a neutral ground. Rules for the tract prohibited individual sale of the land, but the US Congress ended this provision in 1837, creating a land rush and instability.

Centering on the riverboat trade, the settlement continued to grow. The village became known as Keokuk shortly after the Blackhawk War in 1832. Why residents named it after the Sauk chief is unknown. Keokuk was incorporated on December 13, 1847. Soon after, Captain W. Clark would be elected as the first mayor. On December 14, 1848, Keokuk was incorporated as a city by the 2nd General Assembly of the State of Iowa.

Barnard States Merriam was elected mayor in 1852 and reelected in 1854.

In 1853, Keokuk was one of the centers for outfitting additional immigrant Latter-Day Saints pioneers for their handcart journey west; 2,000 Christian Latter-Day Saints passed through the city.

Keokuk was the longtime home of Orion Clemens, brother of Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain. Samuel&#x27;s visits to his brother&#x27;s home led him to write of the beauty of Keokuk and southeastern Iowa in &quot;Life on the Mississippi.&quot;

At one time, because of its position at the foot of the lower rapids of the Mississippi, Keokuk was known as the Gate City. During the American Civil War, Keokuk became an embarking point for Union troops heading to fight in southern battles. Injured soldiers were returned to Keokuk for treatment, so several hospitals were established. A national cemetery was designated for those who did not survive. After the war was over, Keokuk continued its expansion. A medical college was founded, along with a major-league baseball team, the Keokuk Westerns, in 1875.

In 1913, Lock and Dam No. 19 was completed nearby on the Mississippi River. The population of Keokuk reached 15,106 by 1930. During the last half of the 20th century, Keokuk became less engaged in Mississippi River trade and more dependent on jobs in local factories.

==Geography==
Keokuk is in Iowa&#x27;s southeast corner along the Mississippi River and just northeast of the Des Moines River. Hamilton, Illinois, lies to the east across the Mississippi on U.S. Route 136.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The lowest point in the state of Iowa is , located to the immediate south-west of Keokuk where the confluence of the Des Moines and Mississippi Rivers creates a tripoint between Iowa, Illinois and Missouri.

==Sports==
Keokuk has deep baseball history that started in 1875 when the Keokuk Westerns played in the National Association. On May 4, 1875, the Westerns and the Chicago White Stockings (today&#x27;s Chicago Cubs) played the first professional baseball game in Iowa. The Keokuk Indians minor league team played in the Iowa State League (1904–1907), Central Association (1908–1915), Mississippi Valley League (1929–1933) and Western League (1935). After the Indians (1904–1915, 1929–1933, 1935), Keokuk was home to the Keokuk Pirates (1947–1949), Keokuk Kernels (1952-1957), Keokuk Cardinals (1958–1961) and the Keokuk Dodgers (1962). The team was an affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cleveland Indians and the Los Angeles Dodgers. Notable players included baseball pioneer Bud Fowler, 1961 Home Run Record Holder Roger Maris, Player/Announcer Tim McCarver and three time World Series Champion with the New York Yankees Jack Saltzgaver.

Keokuk is nicknamed &quot;The Racing Capital of the World&quot; and &quot;Home of Champions&quot; for having many racing drivers win races and championships. Don White was the first driver to impact nationally; he won the 1954, 1955 and 1958 IMCA national championships. White&#x27;s brother-in-law Ernie Derr won the 12 IMCA national championships between 1953 and 1971. White helped Dick Hutcherson get started; Hutcherson won the 1963 and 1964 IMCA championship before moving to NASCAR and finishing second in points. Ramo Stott won the 1970 and 1971 ARCA and 1976 USAC Stock Car championships. White, Derr, Hutcherson, and Stott were nicknamed &quot;The Keokuk Gang&quot;. Ron Hutcherson, Dick&#x27;s brother, also competed nationally.

People living in the area support athletic teams in Saint Louis, Missouri, differing from other parts of Iowa, which support other sports teams.

== Education ==
The Keokuk Community School District has two elementary schools (George Washington, and Hawthorne), Keokuk Middle School, and Keokuk High School. Several additional elementary schools have been closed over the years (Torrence, Lincoln, Garfield, Wells Carey, and Jefferson). The middle school was damaged by a fire in 2001 and replaced by a new school on a lot next to the high school.

Private education is provided by Keokuk Catholic Schools (St. Vincent&#x27;s School) and Keokuk Christian Academy. Keokuk Catholic previously had a senior high school division, Cardinal Stritch High School; in 2006 it merged into Holy Trinity High School in Fort Madison.

<text>Montrose is a city in Lee County, Iowa. The population was 738 at the time of the 2020 census. The town is located on the Mississippi River. It is part of the Fort Madison-Keokuk Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

The area around Montrose has been occupied continuously since at least the 1780s, when Quashquame&#x27;s village was established nearby. The area was strategically important because it is at the head of the Des Moines Rapids, a major impediment to river traffic that caused large boats to land in this area and transfer freight overland to avoid the rapids. Montrose was the location of Fort Des Moines No. 1, a military post from 1834 to 1837. In 1836 the commander of Fort Des Moines, Lieutenant-Colonel Mason, would begin to plat out the town. Later that year David W. Kilbourne would finish laying out the town, and would name it Montrose. From 1839 to 1846 Montrose was the home of many members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. This was especially true in 1839 when many people lived in an abandoned barracks at Montrose that served as a good short term residence while homes were being built in nearby Nauvoo, Illinois. Among Montrose&#x27;s residents at this time were Brigham Young, Wilford Woodruff and Erastus Snow. Despite legends that the streets of Montrose were aligned to allow a direct view of the Nauvoo Temple across the Mississippi River in Illinois, the streets actually align with the 1834 layout of Fort Des Moines.

Montrose was incorporated in 1857, with Doctor J. Anderson elected the first mayor in June. Montrose became an important river town until the construction of a canal near Keokuk ended the lightering business.

==Geography==
Montrose&#x27;s longitude and latitude coordinates&lt;br&gt;in decimal form are 40.53, −91.417.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Montrose is located in Montrose Township on the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad.

<text>Alburnett is a city in Linn County, Iowa. The population was 675 at the time of the 2020 census. It is part of the Cedar Rapids metropolitan area.

== History ==
In 1887, the Illinois Central Railroad was built through Linn County&#x27;s Otter Creek township. In the winter of that year, a depot was built on land donated by Albert Burnett. Because he had given land for the depot, the name &quot;Burnett&quot; was chosen for its identification.

Business interests began to center around the depot because the railroad offered an outlet to both the north and the south, and because of its proximity to Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Burnett and his wife soon began to plat a community. Meanwhile, landowner Michael Weislogel began to lay out lots a short distance to the south. This community, called &quot;Trentham,&quot; was the site of the first general store and post office. However, because contemporary state law dictated that a depot and post office in the same community must carry the same name, the name was soon changed to &quot;Burnett.&quot; Mail delivery problems soon developed between Burnett and the community of Bennett in Cedar County. Consequently, &quot;Al&quot; Burnett changed the name to &quot;Alburnett.&quot; Alburnett was incorporated in 1912.

<text>Cedar Rapids is a city in and the county seat of Linn County, Iowa, United States. The population was 137,710 at the 2020 census, making it the second-most populous city in Iowa. The city lies on both banks of the Cedar River, north of Iowa City and northeast of Des Moines, the state&#x27;s capital.

Cedar Rapids is the economic hub of Eastern Iowa, located at the core of the Interstate 380 corridor. The population of the three-county Cedar Rapids metropolitan area, which includes the nearby cities of Marion and Hiawatha, was 276,520 in 2020. The Cedar Rapids metropolitan area is also part of a combined statistical area with the Iowa City metropolitan area.

==History==

===Early history===
The location of present-day Cedar Rapids was in the territory of the Meskwaki and Sauk peoples at the time of European American settlement.

The first settler on the site of the future city was Osgood Shepherd, who built a log cabin (which he called a tavern) in 1837 or 1838 next to the Cedar River (then known as the Red Cedar) at what is now the corner of First Avenue and First Street Northeast. Shepherd was a squatter who claimed the land without legal title and also a reputed ne&#x27;er-do-well, who, if he was not a horse thief himself, definitely consorted with them. Early on, it appears that he &quot;jumped the claim&quot; of another squatter, Wilbert Stone, who had built a cabin and platted out a town, some distance south of Shepherd&#x27;s cabin, that he called Columbus. Shepherd drove Stone across the river, claiming that Stone had built his cabin on Shepherd&#x27;s land, then sold Stone&#x27;s cabin to a buyer named Hull. Shepherd later tried the same tactic with perhaps the first settler on the west side of the river, Robert Ellis, but Ellis happened to be chopping wood at the time and warned that someone would be dead if Shepherd did not retreat.

The true founders of the city were George Greene, Nicholas Brown, and a few others. Brown had experience as a miller and Greene had surveyed much of eastern Iowa, so both saw the value of the spot Shepherd had claimed. It was right next to the rapids—a prime spot to build a mill—the last set of rapids on the river before the Cedar fed into the Iowa River, meaning that goods milled on the spot could be carried by boat down river to the Mississippi. In 1841, they formed a partnership that bought out Shepherd&#x27;s claim and platted out a town they called Rapids City. Brown immediately constructed a primitive dam and then built the town&#x27;s first mill. His crude dam soon washed away, prompting Greene to induce Alexander Ely, an engineer from Michigan, to build a proper dam that created a mill race capable of powering several mills.

At this time, the city was confined to the east side of the river. The west bank soon contained a village named Kingston for resident David King who early on operated a rope ferry across the river.

The town was formally incorporated by the Iowa State Legislature on January 15, 1849 as Cedar Rapids, named for the rapids in the Cedar River (the river itself was named for the large number of red cedar trees that grew along its banks). The population was less than 400.

During the 1850s, Cedar Rapids grew in size, and it was during this decade that the Czech population became substantial; when the town was reincorporated in 1856, a quarter of its roughly 1,600 inhabitants were Czech immigrants. The availability of cheap land in the new state of Iowa happened to coincide with the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire that caused a large number of Czechs to flee their homeland and emigrate to the U.S. In 1851, the institution that eventually become Coe College was founded. In the same decade, there were attempts by local leaders to improve the city&#x27;s access to distant markets, first through purchase of a steamboat (aptly named &quot;Cedar Rapids&quot;) and ultimately through investment in a railroad. The first locomotive rolled into town on June 15, 1859.

Railroads were an important factor in the development of the state and the growth of cities along the rail lines. By the end of the 19th century, the 23rd largest state was the fifth largest in track mileage.

In this same decade, &quot;Major&quot; John May, an inventor and land speculator, purchased the island (now called &quot;May&#x27;s Island&quot;) situated between Cedar Rapids and Kingston with the intention of founding a town he called May Island. When that scheme proved impractical due to the island&#x27;s tendency to flood, he conceived the idea of making his island the center of a larger city that spanned the river and convinced the state legislature to officially name the land he had bought there, just south of Kingston, &quot;West Cedar Rapids.&quot;

Cedar Rapids annexed the community of Kingston in 1870 and constructed an iron bridge across the river along the line of the current Third Avenue bridge.

The economic growth of Cedar Rapids increased in 1871 upon the founding of the Sinclair meatpacking company. The plant allowed for year-round meatpacking because ice could be harvested from the Cedar River in winter to chill an icehouse, and within a few years it became one of the largest factories of its kind in the country, employing 400 people. In 1873, the oatmeal mill that ultimately became the flagship operation of the Quaker Oats Company - and the largest cereal mill in the world - was built.

In 1909, the city acquired May&#x27;s Island for the purpose of making it the seat of government; then, as now, there were ill feelings between east- and west-siders in Cedar Rapids, and the city&#x27;s leaders hoped that putting City Hall in the &quot;neutral territory&quot; of the island would help ease tensions. In 1919, the residents of Linn County voted to move the county seat from Marion to Cedar Rapids, partially because Cedar Rapids had offered to donate the southern third of the island as a site for a new county courthouse and jail.

===Flood of 2008===

During the Iowa flood of 2008, the Cedar River reached a record high of on June 13 (the previous record was ), surpassing the 500-year flood plain. 1,126 city blocks were flooded, or more than , and 561 city blocks were severely damaged, on both banks of the Cedar River, comprising 14% of the city&#x27;s total area. 7,749 flooded properties had to be evacuated, including 5,900 homes and 310 city facilities, among them the City Hall, Central Fire Station, Main Public Library, Ground Transportation Center, Public Works building, and the Animal Control building. It is estimated that at least 1,300 properties in the Cedar Rapids area had to be demolished because of the flood, which caused several billions of dollars in damages. More than 4,000 members of the Iowa National Guard were activated to assist the city. The temporary levees became saturated not only with the flood waters but also with additional rainfall, causing them to fail.

Until the flood, the city&#x27;s government was headquartered in the Veterans Memorial Building, near the Linn County Courthouse and jail on Mays Island in the Cedar River; it was designed to be the only island used in this manner in North and South America.

===Flood of 2016===
During the flood of 2016, remnants of Hurricane Paine from the eastern Pacific Ocean via the Gulf of California caused the second highest recorded crest of the Cedar River in Cedar Rapids, reaching on September 27. The inundation of southern Minnesota, central and western Wisconsin, and northeastern Iowa by Hurricane Paine&#x27;s remnants began on September 21 and 22 and continued until the end of the month. The cresting in Cedar Rapids was below the initial estimate of and the revised estimate of , but more than above the flood stage of . The flood was above levels considered to have about a 1% chance of occurring in a given year. More than 5,000 homes were affected, causing over 5,000 people to evacuate. The Cedar Rapids Schools were closed for a week.

In 2015, Cedar Rapids approved a $625 million flood protection plan over 20 years for levee improvements. Although the improvement to the levee system in Cedar Rapids had not been completed due to over $80 million in funding not appropriated by the United States Congresses of 2014 and 2016 and the voting down by local residents of a temporary increase in the local sales tax to pay for the levee improvements, out of school students along with hundreds of thousands of volunteers and 412 Iowa National Guard troops filled more than a quarter of a million sandbags in a successful effort to prevent any major flooding of the city outside the evacuation zone. A system of Hesco barriers, earthen berms, and over 400,000 sandbags were used to plug the gaps in the levee system. The city of Cedar Rapids purchased additional Hesco barriers from Iowa City for $1.4 million. Numerous upstream cities that had been earlier affected by the September flooding and mandatory evacuations, including Charles City, Greene, Manchester, Clarksville, Shell Rock, Vinton, Janesville, Cedar Falls and Waterloo, sent hundreds of thousands of unused sandbags to support efforts in Cedar Rapids and nearby communities. The remnants of Hurricane Paine did not produce any rain to saturate the temporary earth berms and sandbags, which would have greatly increased the likelihood of breach in the temporary levee structures, causing a much greater flooded area; the river crested during very sunny weather. Additionally, beginning on September 25, 300 to 400 National Guard troops along with the Iowa State Patrol, other law enforcement agencies, and 60 duly sworn law enforcement officials enforced a nightly 8pm to 7am curfew.

=== August 10, 2020, Midwest derecho ===
On August 10, 2020, an intense derecho formed over the Midwest and moved eastward across Iowa, with Cedar Rapids being the hardest-hit city. Sustained winds of , frequent gusts of or greater, and an estimated peak gust of on the southwest side of the city damaged the majority of residential and commercial buildings in Cedar Rapids, as well as 20 schools, and resulted in the closure of most local businesses. Thousands of trees were downed throughout all 75 square miles of Cedar Rapids. Most of the city&#x27;s roads became mostly blocked or impassible due to downed trees and blown limbs, power poles along with their lines, and general debris, like large road signs, as well as damaged buildings, homes, and farms. 95% of the city was without power. Trash pickup stopped, cell phone service was very spotty for multiple days, and many gas leaks were reported. Interstate 380 was closed between Cedar Rapids and Iowa City.

Hospitals treated over 300 patients for storm related injuries. Professional estimates suggested that cleanup and removal of the city&#x27;s downed trees could take months. Arborists urged residents not to clear trees on their own, in order to avoid injury.

On Friday, August 14, Governor Kim Reynolds arrived in Cedar Rapids, accompanied by Adjutant General Benjamin Corell of the Iowa National Guard. Gen. Corell said he had not seen a comparable level of damage since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Other city officials described the damage as being even worse than the Iowa flood of 2008.

==Geography==

The city is divided into four quadrants, used in assigning street addresses. 1st Avenue (U.S. Route 151 Business) divides the north and south sides of the city, and the Cedar River divides east and west. Mays Island, in the middle of the river, is the only area of the city where addresses have no quadrant. Areas outside the city limits that have a Cedar Rapids mailing address do not use the quadrants either.

Except in the downtown area, 1st Avenue and the Cedar River tend to run diagonally instead of along the cardinal directions. Due to the curving of 1st Avenue, there are some areas in western Cedar Rapids where NW addresses are actually south of SW addresses.

Cedar Rapids is divided into 14 ZIP Codes. Mays Island and the downtown area are covered by 52401. The northeast quadrant is covered by 52402 and 52411. The southeast quadrant is covered by 52403. The southwest quadrant is covered by 52404. The northwest quadrant is covered by 52405. Post office boxes are covered by ZIP codes 52406, 52407, 52408, 52409, and 52410. Several other ZIP codes are for specific businesses (Aegon USA, Collins Aerospace, etc.).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Neighborhoods===

There are twelve active neighborhood associations in Cedar Rapids. The neighborhoods nearest downtown include Wellington Heights and Oakhill Jackson in the southeast quadrant and Moundview in the northeast quadrant. Also farther north in the northeast quadrant are Noelridge Park and Kenwood Park, which was independent until it was incorporated into the Cedar Rapids city limits. The boundaries of Kenwood are 32nd Street to Oakland Road to Old Marion Road to C Avenue to 40th Street then 1st Avenue between 40th street and 32nd Street.

In addition to the neighborhood associations in Cedar Rapids, there are many informal, unofficial neighborhoods, such as Bowman Woods, Vernon Heights, Stoney Point, Kingston Village, New Bohemia (NewBo) and Wilderness Estates.

Czech Village is located along 16th Avenue SW, south of the Cedar River. It is home to such Czech-themed businesses as The Czech Cottage, Sykora Bakery, and White Lion Treasures. The National Czech &amp; Slovak Museum &amp; Library is one of Cedar Rapids&#x27; major tourist attractions. The museum&#x27;s main building was directly on the river and was badly damaged by the 2008 floods. After the flood the museum moved a few blocks to Inspiration Place SW. The Bohemian National Cemetery is located nearby.

In 2024, a new astronomical clock was built, the opening was attending by Czech President Petr Pavel and his wife Eva Pavlová and Slovak President Peter Pellegrini.

===Tourism===
Cedar Rapids is nicknamed the &quot;City of Five Seasons&quot;, for the so-called &quot;fifth season&quot;, which is time to enjoy the other four. This slogan is often satirized by residents as the &quot;City of Five Smells&quot;, as a result of the smell combinations in the 1970s from the city&#x27;s Quaker Oats and Penford factories, a hog slaughterhouse, and the municipal sewage plant and landfill. The symbol of the five seasons is the Tree of Five Seasons sculpture in downtown along the north river bank. The name &quot;Five Seasons&quot; and representations of the sculpture appear throughout the city in many forms.

Withal, the arch represents forwards progress, as well as the city&#x27;s flood wall and the star represents the historic structures on Mays Island with its five stars depicting the City of Five Seasons.

In 1962, a flag design was chosen through a design contest among high schools. The artist, Fred Easker Jr, was a high-school senior at the time. The flag depicts buildings of Cedar Rapids in blue and the words &quot;Cedar Rapids&quot; and &quot;Iowa&quot; above and below it in red. Among the buildings depicted were: a veterans memorial, a church, corn stalks, a factory, an early mill and an unfinished building to signify the city&#x27;s promising future.

In 2004, the North American Vexillological Association ranked Cedar Rapids&#x27; flag as among the worst flags in the United States. Moreover, the flag was decried during a TED Talk in 2015. On account of this criticism, Cedar Rapids began the process of redesigning the city&#x27;s flag.

==Government==

From 1908 to 2005, Cedar Rapids used the city commission form of government. It was one of the few larger American cities remaining to operate under this model. Under this form of government, the council was made up of a public safety commissioner, a streets commissioner, a finance commissioner, a parks commissioner, and a mayor. The council members worked on a full-time basis, served two-year terms, and were considered department heads. Don Canney, the longest-serving mayor in city history, served for 22 years under this system. The last mayor of Cedar Rapids under this form of government was Paul Pate. In 2005, after the issue was brought forth by the city commission, 69% of voters moved to adopt a new form of government.

Cedar Rapids now has an Iowa Home Rule charter which establishes a weak mayor system with a part-time city council and mayor both on four-year terms. Jeff Pomeranz has served as the city&#x27;s manager since 2010.

The event typically includes a 5K run, parade, fireworks, and many other family friendly activities.

The town was the home to St. Berchman&#x27;s Seminary, established in 1905 by the Sisters of Mercy as a boarding school for small boys. The academy, which closed in 1942, consisted of five buildings spread over 23 acres. One of the most famous residents was actor Don Ameche, who lived in the facility as a boy; he went on to star in the movie &quot;Cocoon&quot;. Today, the main building, now housing apartments, is all that remains.
The current site of the Indian Creek Country Club was once the home of a sulky horse racing track. In November 2019, Mayor Nick AbouAssaly won a second term over Mary Lou Pazour with 70 percent of the vote.

The most prominent geographic feature of Mount Vernon is the &quot;mountain&quot; on which it sits. This &quot;mountain&quot; is actually a paha, a ridge formed of sand and loess along the line of the prevailing wind during the ice ages. The Mount Vernon paha is roughly one mile (2 km) long and 1/4 mile (1/2 km) wide, aligned along a roughly northwest to southeast axis and rising up to 100 feet (30 m) above the surrounding landscape. Uptown Mount Vernon is aligned with the southeast end of the ridge crest, while the campus of Cornell College crowns the northwest end of the ridge.

=== Annual events ===
A sidewalk chalk festival, &quot;Chalk the Walk&quot;, has taken place in Mount Vernon each May starting in 2006. Several blocks in Uptown Mount Vernon are closed to traffic, and people from all over are encouraged to create their own artwork on more than of the main street. The event attracts over 300 artists and requires more than a half-ton of chalk. Artists register to color an 8&#x27; x 10&#x27; section of pavement with their own design. Although participation is free, cash prizes are awarded for these large drawings. Each year there is also one large collaborative piece of art that is 20&#x27; by 40&#x27;. Interested participants recreate a single 2&#x27; by 2&#x27; square of the image; the result is an image colored with pastel chalk by dozens of artists of all ages and abilities. Chalk the Walk is Iowa&#x27;s largest annual Madonnari Festival.

&quot;Magical Night&quot;, a downtown Christmas festival, takes place in December.

Other events include the &quot;Chocolate Stroll, Heritage Days, Chili Cook-Off&quot;, and &quot;Uptown Thursday Nights&quot;.

<text>Columbus Junction is a city in Louisa County, Iowa. The population was 1,830 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Muscatine Micropolitan Statistical Area.

Columbus Junction is home of the historic Swinging Bridge, found one block south of Highway 92 near downtown. The 262-foot-long steel cable and wood suspension bridge was built in 1922 as an elevated walkway connecting Third and Fourth streets.

The Columbus Community School District (which serves Columbus Junction, Columbus City, Fredonia, Cotter, Conesville, and other surrounding townships) is based in Columbus Junction. The school&#x27;s colors are blue and white and their mascot is a wildcat.

The city&#x27;s largest employer is a Tyson Foods meat processing plant located just north of the city on Highway 70.

==History==
Columbus Junction began as a settlement located at the intersection of two railroad lines. The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (also known as the Rock Island [Line]) built an east–west line through the area in 1858, and the perpendicular north–south Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Minnesota Railroad (BCR&amp;M) line was built in 1870.

The first local business, a restaurant and boarding house imported via the Rock Island from Muscatine, Iowa, opened the day after a BCR&amp;M train made the inaugural stop and crossing of the newly completed intersection. Just a month later, on March 12, 1870, the town was platted.

Neighboring Columbus City had been established before the railroads arrived and both the Rock Island and BCR&amp;M had built their lines over a mile&#x27;s distance away. Because they had invested in the latter line, they were permitted to name the new town, and so it became Columbus Junction.

The largest sustained period of growth for Columbus Junction was from 1960 to 2000, driven primarily by job creation in meat processing. From 1961 to 1982 Rath Packing Company operated a hog processing plant just north of the city. In 1985 the facility reopened under the ownership of IBP, and in 2001 was bought by Tyson Foods.

Immigration has played a strong role in the history of Columbus Junction. The most recent wave of immigrants includes refugees from the Chin State of Myanmar (Burma). Many of them work in the meat processing plants.

The Iowa Flood of 2008 impacted Columbus Junction along with many other towns and cities. The damage dealt by the inundation affected 29 businesses and non-profits, but the community has since been able to recover.

==Geography==
Columbus Junction is located between the cities of Columbus City and Fredonia. It lies at the confluence of two rivers, the Iowa and the Cedar.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.
