<doc id="107056" wikidata="Q79233" url="?curid=107056" title="Altheimer, Arkansas">
<text>Altheimer ( ) is a city in Plum Bayou Township, Jefferson County, Arkansas, United States. It is situated on the Union Pacific Railway, northeast of Pine Bluff. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 984, down from 1,192 at the 2000 census. As of 2018 the estimated population was 829 and was down to 696 in the 2020 Census, with zero change estimated in 2021 and 2022.

==Geography==
Altheimer is part of the Timberlands Region, an area rich in natural resources that was discovered by pioneers from the eastern states in the early 19th century. Deer hunting, bass fishing, timber and oil are plentiful in this area.

Altheimer is in northeastern Jefferson County, northeast of Pine Bluff, the county seat. U.S. Route 63/79 runs along the northwestern edge of the city, leading southwest to Pine Bluff and northeast to Humphrey. Little Rock, the state capital, is to the northwest by road.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Altheimer has a total area of , of which are land and , or 3.22%, are water. Flat Bayou winds through the center of the city, flowing north toward Wabbaseka Bayou, which in turn flows southeast via a succession of names to the Arkansas River.

==History==
The city was named for brothers Joseph and Louis Altheimer, two Pine Bluff merchants. Louis, who was born in Eberstadt in 1850, read stories by German adventurer Frederick Gerstacker telling of the rich natural resources in Arkansas, and left for America as a teenager, eventually settling in Pine Bluff. Louis brought his brother Joseph with him to the land that would eventually bear their name. Joseph&#x27;s son, Benjamin, became a successful attorney, establishing the prominent Chicago law firm of Altheimer, Mayer, Woods, and Smith (later known as Altheimer &amp; Gray), and serving twice as president of Chicago&#x27;s Iroquois Club, the city&#x27;s oldest Democratic Party political club. Benjamin owned of land in Arkansas. His foundation, the Ben J. Altheimer Foundation, provided scholarships and funding for projects throughout the state and continues today as the Ben J. Altheimer Charitable Foundation, Inc.

Altheimer is home to many restored pioneer-era log cabins, Victorian era plantation houses and museums. One of the most prominent locations is The Elms, a former plantation house on the Collier Estate built in 1886, renovated by Ben Altheimer in the 1930s. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, The Elms is open to the public for retreats, family reunions and tours. Also located on the property are the Elms Duck Lodges, which provides hunting and fishing in the private lake and pond. Roselawn, also known as the Collier-Barnett House, was built in 1875 and added to National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Lake Dick is an oxbow lake located south of Altheimer. This area formerly held farmsteads of eighty white American families who were moved into the area in 1936 as part of the Farm Security Administration. Lake Dick was added to the register in 1975.

In 2007 and 2013, respectively, Altheimer&#x27;s secondary and elementary schools closed. As a result, a number of residents moved to Pine Bluff to be closer to the zoned schools operated by the Dollarway School District, and multiple businesses lost revenue.

==Demographics==
===2020 Census===
===2000 Census===
As of the census of 2010, there were 984 people, 361 households, and 248 families residing in the city. The racial makeup of the city was 10% White, 88.1% Black or African American, 1% Asian, 0.6% from other races, and 0.3% from two or more races. 1.4% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 361 households, out of which 25.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 37.1% were married couples living together, 24.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31.3% were non-families. 27.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 2.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.73 and the average family size was 3.29.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 29.3% under the age of 18, 7.4% from 15 to 19, 7.0% from 40 to 44, 5.3% from 60 to 64, and 13.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36.9 years.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary schools===
Altheimer is served by the Pine Bluff School District. Students are zoned to Park/Greenville School for preschool, James Matthews Elementary School, Robert F. Morehead Middle School, and Dollarway High School.

In the racial segregation era Altheimer Training School served as the high school for African-Americans, while Altheimer High School served as the high school for white students. At one point it was served by the Altheimer School District, which operated Martin Elementary School, Martin High School, Altheimer Elementary School, and Altheimer High School in Altheimer. The Altheimer-Sherrill district was created in 1979 when the Altheimer and Sherrill districts merged.

On September 1, 1993, Altheimer-Sherrill consolidated into the Altheimer Unified School District; Altheimer Unified operated two schools: Martin Elementary School and Altheimer-Sherrill High School. The Altheimer Unified School District consolidated into the Dollarway School District on July 10, 2006.

Altheimer-Martin Elementary School, a Dollarway School District elementary school, occupied the former high school facility. The building was built in 1987; it included a gymnasium. Up to 2013 the school&#x27;s enrollment declined, and in 2013 the Dollarway superintendent decided that the school should be closed in light of the declining attendance. In its final year the school had 78 students. Since 2013 some property had been taken from the school building, and a lack of maintenance occurred. Altheimer mayor Zola Hudson stated a desire for the city government to repurpose the building. By 2018 the district was proceeding to donate the elementary building.

Altheimer Middle School and Altheimer-Sherrill High School both closed in 2007. At the time the middle school had 102 students and the high school had 137 students.

In December 2020 the Arkansas State Board of Education ruled that the Dollarway School District should merge into the Pine Bluff School District as of July 1, 2021; the post-merger school district is to operate all existing schools from both districts. Accordingly, the attendance boundary maps of the respective schools remained the same for the 2021–2022 school year, and all DSD territory went to be within the PBSD territory. The exception was with the pre-kindergarten levels, as all PBSD areas are now assigned to Forrest Park/Greenville School, including the territory from the former Dollarway district. In 2023 the district announced that Dollarway High would merge into Pine Bluff High School, and that Morehead Middle School would become the only middle school for all of the Pine Bluff School District.

===Public libraries===
The Pine Bluff and Jefferson County Library System operates the Altheimer Branch, an about building identical to that of the Redfield Library, located on a tract in Altheimer. The library was built on land sold by Altheimer Unified to the county government for $3,784. The library was constructed in October 2001.

<text>Pine Bluff is the tenth-most populous city in the US state of Arkansas and the county seat of Jefferson County. The population of the city was 41,253 in the 2020 census. The city is situated in the Southeast section of the Arkansas Delta and straddles the Arkansas Timberlands region to its west. Its topography is flat with wide expanses of farmland, similar to other places in the Delta Lowlands. Pine Bluff has numerous creeks, streams, and bayous, including Bayou Bartholomew, the longest bayou in the world and the second most ecologically diverse stream in the United States. Large bodies of water include Lake Pine Bluff, Lake Langhofer (Slack Water Harbor), and the Arkansas River.

==History==

===Pre-Columbian era to colonial era===
The area along the Arkansas River had been inhabited for thousands of years by indigenous peoples of various cultures. They used the river for transportation as did European settlers after them, and for fishing. By the time of encounter with Europeans, the historical Quapaw were the chief people in the area, having migrated from the Ohio River valley centuries before. 

The city of Pine Bluff was founded on a high bank of the Arkansas River heavily forested with tall pine trees. The high ground furnished settlers a safe haven from annual flooding. Joseph Bonne, a Métis fur trader and trapper of mixed Quapaw and colonial French ancestry, settled on this bluff in 1819.

===1824–1860: Antebellum era===
After the Quapaw signed a treaty with the United States in 1824 relinquishing their title to all the lands which they claimed in Arkansas, many other American settlers began to join Bonne on the bluff. In 1829 Thomas Phillips claimed a half section of land where Pine Bluff is located. Jefferson County was established by the Territorial Legislature on November 2, 1829, and began functioning as a county April 19, 1830.

At the August 13, 1832, county election, the pine bluff settlement was chosen as the county seat. The Quorum Court voted to name the village &quot;Pine Bluff Town&quot; on October 16, 1832. Pine Bluff was incorporated January 8, 1839, by the order of County Judge Taylor. At the time, the village had about 50 residents. Improved transportation aided in the growth of Pine Bluff during the 1840s and 1850s.

With its proximity to the Arkansas River, the small town served as a port for travel and shipping. Steamships provided the primary mode of transport, arriving from downriver ports such as New Orleans. From 1832 to 1838, Pine Bluff residents would see Native American migrants on the Trail of Tears waterway who were being forcibly removed by the US Army from the American Southeast to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River.

From 1832 to 1858, Pine Bluff was also a station on the passage of Seminole and Black Seminoles, who were forcibly removed from Florida to the Territory. They included the legendary Black Seminole leader John Horse, who arrived in the city via the steamboat &quot;Swan&quot; in 1842.

===1861–1900: Civil War, Reconstruction era, and beyond===
Pine Bluff was prospering by the outbreak of the Civil War; most of its wealth was based on the commodity crop of cotton. This was cultivated on large plantations by hundreds of thousands of enslaved Africans throughout the state, but especially in the Delta. The city had one of the largest slave populations in the state by 1860, and Jefferson County, Arkansas was second in cotton production in the state. When Union forces occupied Little Rock, a group of Pine Bluff residents asked commanding Major General Frederick Steele to send Union forces to occupy their town to protect them from bands of Confederate bushwhackers. Union troops under Colonel Powell Clayton arrived September 17, 1863, and stayed until the war was over.
On October 25, 1863, Confederate cavalry, led by Brigadier-General John S. Marmaduke, attempted to expel Union occupation forces commanded by Colonel Powell Clayton; but were defeated by a combined force of federal troops and freedmen (former slaves freed by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s recent Emancipation Proclamation) near Jefferson Court-House. In the final year of the Civil War, the 1st Kansas Colored Infantry Regiment (composed primarily of escaped slaves from Arkansas and Missouri), was the first regiment of U.S. Colored Troops to see combat. It was dispatched to guard Pine Bluff and eventually mustered out there.

Because of the Union forces, Pine Bluff attracted many refugees and freedmen after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued in early 1863. The Union forces set up a contraband camp there to house the runaway slaves and refugees behind Confederate lines. After the war, freed slaves worked with the American Missionary Association to start schools for the education of blacks, who had been prohibited from learning to read and write by southern laws. Both adults and children eagerly started learning. By September 1872, Professor Joseph C. Corbin opened the Branch Normal School of the Arkansas Industrial University, a historically black college. Founded as Arkansas&#x27;s first black public college, today it is the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff.

Pine Bluff and the region suffered lasting effects from defeat, the aftermath of war, and the trauma of slavery and exploitation. Recovery was slow at first. Construction of railroads improved access to markets, and with increased production of cotton as more plantations were reactivated, the economy began to recover. The first railroad reached Pine Bluff in December 1873. This same year Pine Bluff&#x27;s first utility was formed when Pine Bluff Gas Company began furnishing manufactured gas from coke fuel for lighting purposes. The state&#x27;s economy remained highly dependent on cotton and agriculture, which suffered a decline through the 19th century.

As personal fortunes increased from the 1870s onward, community leaders constructed large Victorian-style homes west of Main Street. Meanwhile, the Reconstruction era of the 1870s brought a stark mix of progress and challenge for African Americans. Most blacks joined the Republican Party, and several were elected in Pine Bluff to county offices and the state legislature for the first time in history. Several black-owned businesses were also opened, including banks, bars, barbershops, and other establishments. But in postwar violence in 1866, an altercation with whites ensued at a refugee camp, and 24 black men, women and children were found hanging from trees in one of the worst mass lynchings in U.S. history.
The rate of lynchings of black males was high across the South during this period of social tensions and white resistance to Reconstruction. Armistad Johnson was lynched in 1889, and John Kelly and Gulbert Harris in 1892 in front of the Jefferson County Courthouse, after a mob of hundreds rapidly escalated to thousands of whites vehemently demanding execution, despite Kelly&#x27;s pleas of innocence and lack of trial. The angry mob eventually forced over his custody from an Officer adamantly attempting to deliver the suspect to the jail house, then the crowd watched enthusiastically as he was hung and riddled with bullets. That same year the state adopted a poll tax amendment that disenfranchised many African-American and poor white voters. The Election Law of 1891 had already made voting more difficult and also caused voter rolls to decrease. With the Democratic Party consolidating its power in what became a one-party state, the atmosphere was grim toward the end of the 19th century for many African Americans. Democrats imposed legal segregation and other Jim Crow laws.

Bishop Henry McNeal Turner&#x27;s &quot;Back to Africa&quot; movement attracted numbers of local African-American residents who purchased tickets and/or sought information on emigration. Arkansas had 650 emigrants depart to the colony of Liberia in West Africa, more than from any other state in the United States. The majority of these emigrants came from the black-majority Jefferson, St. Francis, Pulaski, Pope, and Conway counties.

According to historian James Leslie, Pine Bluff entered its &quot;Golden Era&quot; in the 1880s. Cotton production and river commerce helped the city draw industries, public institutions and residents to the area, making it by 1890 the state&#x27;s third-largest city. The first telephone system was placed in service March 31, 1883. Wiley Jones, a freedman who achieved wealth by his own business, built the first mule-drawn, street-car line in October 1886. The first light, power and water plant was completed in 1887; a more dependable light and water system was put in place in 1912. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, economic expansion was also fueled by the growing lumber industry in the region.

===1900–1941: 1900 through the Great Depression===
Situated on the Arkansas River, Pine Bluff depended on river traffic and trade. Community leaders were concerned that the main channel would leave the city. The United States Army Corps of Engineers built a levee opposite Pine Bluff to try to keep the river flowing by the city.

During a later flood, the main channel of the river moved away from the city, leaving a small oxbow lake (later expanded into Lake Pine Bluff). River traffic diminished, even as the river was a barrier separating one part of the county from the other. After many years of regional haggling, because the bond issue involved raised taxes, the county built the Free Bridge, which opened in 1914. For the first time, it united the county on a permanent basis. 

African Americans in Pine Bluff were damaged by the state&#x27;s disfranchisement in 1891–1892 and exclusion from the political system. But they continued to work for their rights; they joined activists in Little Rock and Hot Springs in a sustained boycott of streetcars, protesting passage in 1903 of the Segregated Streetcar Act, part of a series of Jim Crow laws passed by the white-dominated legislature. They did not achieve change then.

Development in the city&#x27;s business district grew rapidly. The Masonic Lodge, built by and for the African-American chapter in the city, was the tallest building in Pine Bluff when completed in 1904. The Hotel Pines, constructed in 1912, had an intricate marble interior and classical design, and was considered one of Arkansas&#x27; showcase hotels. The 1,500-seat Saenger Theater, built in 1924, was one of the largest such facilities in the state; it operated the state&#x27;s largest pipe organ. When Dollarway Road was completed in 1914, it was the longest continuous stretch of concrete road in the United States. The first radio station (WOK) broadcast in Arkansas occurred in Pine Bluff on February 18, 1922.

Two natural disasters had devastating effects on the area&#x27;s economy. The first was the Great Flood of 1927, a 100-year flood. Due to levee breaks, most of northern and southeastern Jefferson County were flooded. The severe drought of 1930 caused another failure of crops, adding to the problems of economic conditions during the Great Depression. Pine Bluff residents scrambled to survive. In 1930, two of the larger banks failed.

The state&#x27;s highway construction program in the later 1920s and early 1930s, facilitating trade between Pine Bluff and other communities throughout southeast Arkansas, was critical to Jefferson County, too. After the inauguration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933, he launched many government programs to benefit local communities. Through the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and public works funding, Pine Bluff built new schools and a football stadium, and developed Oakland Park as its first major recreation facility. To encourage diversification in agriculture, the county built a stockyard in 1936 to serve as a sales outlet for farmers&#x27; livestock.

From 1936 to 1938, the WPA through the Federal Writers Project initiated a project to collect and publish oral histories of former slaves. Writers were sent throughout the South to interview former slaves, most of whom had been children before the Civil War. When the project was complete, Arkansas residents had contributed more oral slave histories (approximately 780) than any other state, although Arkansas&#x27; slave population was less than those of neighboring Deep South states. African-American residents of Pine Bluff/Jefferson County contributed more oral interviews of Arkansas-born slaves than any other city/county in the state. The city served to compile a valuable storehouse of oral slave narrative material.

During the 1933 Mississippi River flood, country singer Johnny Cash evacuated to Pine Bluff.

===1941–1960: World War II and economic diversification===

World War II brought profound changes to Pine Bluff and its agriculture, timber and railroad-oriented economy. The Army built Grider Field Airport which housed the Pine Bluff School of Aviation and furnished flight training for air cadets for the Army Air Corps. At one time 275 aircraft were being used to train 758 pilots. Approximately 9,000 pilots had been trained by the time the school closed in October 1944.

The Army broke ground for the Pine Bluff Arsenal on December 2, 1941, on bought north of the city. The arsenal and Grider Field changed Pine Bluff to a more diversified economy with a mixture of industry and agriculture. The addition of small companies to the industrial base helped the economy remain steady in the late 1940s. Defense spending in association with the Korean War was a stabilizing factor after 1950.

In 1957, Richard Anderson announced the construction of a kraft paper mill north of the city. International Paper Co. shortly afterward bought a plant site five miles east of Pine Bluff. Residential developments followed for expected workers. The next year young minister Martin Luther King Jr. addressed students at the commencement program for Arkansas AM&amp;N College (now the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff).

===1960–present: The modern era===
The decade of the 1960s brought heightened activism in the civil rights movement: through boycotts and demonstrations, African Americans demanded an end to segregated public facilities and jobs. Whites responded with violence, attacking demonstrators, and bombing a black church in Pine Bluff in 1963. Some civil rights demonstrators were shot. Local leaders worked tirelessly, at times enlisting the support of national figures such as Dick Gregory and Stokely Carmichael, to help bring about change over the period. Voter registration drives that enabled increased black political participation, selective buying campaigns, student protests, and a desire among white local business leaders to avoid damaging negative media portrayals in the national media led to reforms in public accommodations.

During the 1960s and 1970s, major construction projects in the region included private and public sponsors: Jefferson Hospital (now Jefferson Regional Medical Center), the dams of the McClellan-Kerr Navigation System on the Arkansas River (which was diverted from the city to create Lake Langhofer), a Federal building, the Pine Bluff Convention Center complex including The Royal Arkansas Hotel &amp; Suites, Pine Bluff Regional Park, two industrial parks and several large churches.

The 1980s and 1990s brought a number of significant construction projects. Benny Scallion Park was created, named for the alderman who brought a Japanese garden to the Pine Bluff Civic Center. The city has not maintained the garden, but a small plaque remains. In the late 1980s, The Pines, the first large, enclosed shopping center, was constructed on the east side of the city. The mall attracted increased shopping traffic from southeast Arkansas. 

The most important construction project of the 1990s was completion of a southern bypass, designated part of Interstate 530. In addition, a highway and bridge across Lock and Dam #4 were completed, providing another link between farm areas in northeastern Jefferson County and the transportation system radiating from Pine Bluff. Through a private matching grant, a multimillion-dollar Arts and Science Center for Southeast Arkansas was completed downtown in 1994.

In 2000, construction was completed on the Donald W. Reynolds Community Services Center. Carl Redus became the first African American mayor in the city&#x27;s history in 2005. The University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff recently opened a $3 million business incubator in downtown Pine Bluff. Also, a new $2 million farmers market pavilion was opened in 2010 on Lake Pine Bluff in downtown Pine Bluff.

Shirley Washington is the first female African American mayor. She was elected in 2016.

Beginning around 2020, Utah based entrepreneur John Fenley, owner of the music streaming service Murfie, began buying properties in Pine Bluff for redevelopment.

==Geography==

Pine Bluff is on the Arkansas River; the community was named for a bluff along that river. Both Lake Pine Bluff and Lake Langhofer are situated within the city limits, as these are bodies of water which are remnants of the historical Arkansas River channel. (The former is a man-made expansion of a natural oxbow; the latter was created by diking the old channel after a man-made diversion.) Consequently, the Mississippi Alluvial Plain (or the Arkansas Delta) runs well into the city with Bayou Bartholomew picking up the western border as a line of demarcation between the Arkansas Delta and the Arkansas Timberlands.

A series of levees and dams surrounds the area to provide for flood control and protect from channel shift. One of the world&#x27;s longest individual levees at 380 miles runs from Pine Bluff to Venice, Louisiana.

The exception was with the pre-kindergarten levels, as all PBSD areas are now assigned to Forrest Park/Greenville School, including the territory from the former Dollarway district. In 2023 the district announced that Dollarway High would merge into Pine Bluff High School, and that Morehead Middle School would become the only middle school for all of the Pine Bluff School District.

<text>Clarksville is a city in Johnson County, Arkansas, United States. As of the 2010 census the population was 9,178, up from 7,719 in 2000. As of 2018, the estimated population was 9,743. The city is the county seat of Johnson County. It is nestled between the Arkansas River and the foothills of the Ozark Mountains, and Interstate 40 and US Highway 64 intersect within the city limits. Clarksville-Johnson County is widely known for its peaches, scenic byways and abundance of natural outdoor recreational activities.

==History==
The community began as settlers arrived to the Arkansas Territory. After the Osage tribe was relocated by treaty, Cherokee settlers came to Arkansas by 1800 and primarily lived along the Arkansas River. A federal Indian trading factory under Matthew Lyon was established at Spadra in 1818, now at the west end of Lake Dardanelle on the Arkansas River, a Clarksville location now occupied by Spadra Marina. A historical marker, dedicated in 1984, sits on Spadra Bluff, near the original river town of Spadra. The area was reserved for the Cherokee, so most early settlers of Johnson County did not move into the area until after 1828, the year the Cherokee gave up their land.

Spadra was the first county seat of Johnson County, convenient to steamboat lines. However, when stagecoach and train transportation became more common, land routes from Little Rock to Fort Smith were directed along higher elevations through Clarksville. As Clarksville grew, it became the &quot;de facto&quot; location for the county seat circa 1833, probably due to severe flooding at Spadra. Clarksville was established by survey in November 1836 after Johnson County was formed from part of Pope County. The first court session was held in 1837 in a private building.

By July 1853 the Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad opted to go through Clarksville instead of Spadra, due to financial incentives provided by the county commissioners based in Clarksville. Almost twenty miles of track toward Spadra were removed during the realignment. Regular rail service began following the Civil War, aiding in Clarksville&#x27;s growth, while the hamlet of New Spadra began beside the new tracks. Fewer settlers arrived by river transportation so Spadra was less useful, so its major buildings deteriorated or were moved, while Clarksville became the destination of many new settlers arriving by train.

==Geography==
Clarksville is located in south-central Johnson County and is bordered to the south by the Arkansas River, although the city center is north of the river and west of Spadra Creek.

Interstate 40 leads southeast to Little Rock and west to Fort Smith.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Clarksville has a total area of , of which are land and , or 3.66%, are water.

<text>Hoxie is a city in Lawrence County, Arkansas, United States. It lies immediately south of Walnut Ridge. The population was 2,780 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
=== The third Arkansas school to integrate ===
Prior to 1955, Hoxie maintained a dual system of education for younger students, one for white students and another one for black students. Rather than maintain two high schools, white high school students were educated locally, while black high school students were bused to a black school in Jonesboro. The negro school for grades 1-8 had only one teacher. On June 25, 1955, in response to the recent &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; ruling, Hoxie&#x27;s superintendent, Kunkel Edward Vance, spearheaded plans to integrate the schools, and he received the unanimous support of Hoxie&#x27;s school board. On July 11, 1955, Hoxie schools recommenced and allowed African American students to attend. In order to do &quot;what was morally right in the sight of God&quot; and to &quot;uphold the law of the land&quot;, Vance insisted that all facilities, including restrooms and cafeterias, be integrated.

Although there were many nervous parents, the schools opening on July 11 went smoothly. The teachers and children got along fine, but unlike the two other school districts in Arkansas (Charleston and Fayetteville) that implemented partial integration, Hoxie attracted national attention. A team of photographers from Life Magazine was on hand to document the event. After the publication of the Life article, segregationists from outside the area converged on Hoxie in an unsuccessful attempt to reverse the school board decision. Handbills were printed making wild assertions including allegations of a plot between negroes, Communists, and Jews, and advocating for the death of &quot;Race Mixers&quot;. A group of local citizens, led by soybean farmer Herbert Brewer, confronted the school board in an unproductive meeting. After the meeting, Brewer organized a White Citizen&#x27;s Council, which called for students, both black and white to boycott the schools. Approximately one third of the white students refused to attend the schools beginning on August 4, 1955.

A lawyer, Amis Guthridge, the leader of White America, inc., attempted to draw more outside influence into the fray, inflaming passions with statements such as calling school integration a &quot;plan that was founded in Moscow in 1924 to mongrelize the white race in America&quot; and claimed that &quot;white Methodist women&quot; wanted integration so they could get negro men into their bedroom. Johnson, Guthridge and others fanned the flames, and were joined by Orval Faubus in trying to invoke fears of miscegenation in white husbands and parents. In one rally, a speaker shouted &quot;they do not want equality, you know they don&#x27;t want equality&quot;...&quot;They want what you&#x27;ve got, they want your women!&quot;

The Hoxie School Board filed suit against the segregationist leaders from Hoxie and elsewhere in the state and charged them with trespassing on school property, threatening picket lines, organizing boycotts, and intimidating school officials. In November 1955, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas Thomas C. Trimble ruled that pro-segregationists had &quot;planned and conspired&quot; to prevent integration in Hoxie. In December 1955, he issued a permanent injunction and restraining order against the segregationists. Their appeal in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals was opposed by United States Attorney General Herbert Brownell and the U.S. Department of Justice. This marked the first intervention by the attorney general in support of any school district attempting to comply with the &quot;Brown&quot; decision. On October 25, 1956, the court ruled in favor of the Hoxie School Board.

U.S. Attorney Osro Cobb recalls that the situation at Hoxie

had reached the point of possible bloodshed. Guns were being carried; threats were being made, and violence could have erupted at any moment. Notwithstanding, a conference exploring the situation and its possible effects on the community with the individuals at the core of the problem had worked a minor miracle. It demonstrated that while passions and prejudice in race relations often hurl reason aside, reason can be restored at the conference table where there is dedication by the parties to the public interest. That is the lesson to be learned from Hoxie.

In 2003, David Appleby produced a documentary entitled &quot;Hoxie - The First Stand&quot; detailing the events of school integration in Hoxie. The film later received the Peabody Award and the Du Pont Award for Broadcast Journalism.

===Train crash===
On August 17, 2014, at 2:30 AM, two Union Pacific freight trains collided in Hoxie, killing two people and causing the evacuation of about 500 people within a 1.5 square mile radius. U.S. 67 was closed for approximately one week for cleanup and repair.

==Geography==

Hoxie is located at (36.048616, -90.977296).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

=== List of highways ===

* U.S. 63
* U.S. 67
* U.S. 63 Business
* Highway 367

U.S. Highways 63 and 67 intersect and cross each other in Hoxie. U.S. 63 enters Arkansas at the Missouri line at Thayer, Missouri, and Mammoth Spring, Arkansas, two contiguous cities. U.S. 63 then goes southeastward to connect with Interstate 55 near Turrell, in Crittenden County. It runs contiguous with I-55 and I-40 for a ways. Both those interstates cross the Mississippi River into Memphis, Tennessee. U.S. 63 is then contiguous with a number of other routes southward in Arkansas, leaving Arkansas for Louisiana at Junction City, in Union County. U.S. 67 is a southwest—northeast bisector of Arkansas.

Two railroads, the Burlington Northern-Santa Fe and the Union Pacific, have mainline tracks that cross each other at Hoxie—the BNSF in a generally northwest-southeast direction, and the UP in a generally north and south direction. This same situation also occurs in Jonesboro, in Craighead County.

<text>Powhatan () is a town in Lawrence County, Arkansas, United States, along the Black River. The population was 72 at the 2010 census, up from 50 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==
Powhatan is located in northern Lawrence County at (36.083098, -91.119626).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

===Transportation===
The main highway serving Powhatan is Arkansas Highway 25 (AR 25). The route continues northeast from Powhatan to Black Rock and southwest to Batesville. Highway 117S, a short spur route of Highway 117, runs into Powhatan and terminates at AR 25. Access to US Route 62/US Route 63/US Route 412 (US 62/US 63/US 412), a concurrency of major east–west routes, is available in Black Rock.

==History==
The community was the economic hub of Lawrence County even before first platting in 1849. Situated on the Black River, the community took advantage of river traffic both along the river and as a ferry point for crossing the river. The Military Road passed nearby in the 1830s, and the local economy was flourishing. The Civil War shut down commerce on the river, especially after the Union regained control of Arkansas. Skirmishes throughout the region caused havoc for residents, but a slow recovery began to take place following the war. County government was relocated to Powhatan from Clover Bend, a decision greatly helping Powhatan recover.

The Kansas City-Memphis Railway chose to bypass Powhatan around 1880, causing nearby Black Rock to grow to prominence instead. The Lawrence County judiciary chose to split in 1887, allowing court to be held in Walnut Ridge and Powhatan. US Route 63 (US 63) was rerouted to bypass Powhatan in the 1950s, and all county government moved to Walnut Ridge in 1963.

==Government and infrastructure==

===Local government===
Earnest Nash, Jr. was the mayor of Gould from 2011 to 2020. He is a member of the Gould Citizens Advisory Council, a political group.

Around 2011 Gould had almost $300,000 ($ when adjusted for inflation) in unpaid taxes. The mayor, the group, and the city council experienced conflict over how to pay the taxes. The council believed that the citizen&#x27;s group was trying to take too much influence in the city government. In June 2011 the council passed an ordinance saying that it is illegal to form any group without the permission of the city council. The mayor vetoed the law. On July 12, 2011, the council overrode the veto. The council also overrode a veto on a bill stating that the citizen&#x27;s council may no longer exist and that the mayor may not meet with any organization in any location inside or outside the Gould city limits without the permission of the city council. The mayor stated that he refuses to stop meeting with groups, and that he would go to jail if given the choice between going to jail or not associating with the group. Nash said that the ordinances were not allowed under the U.S. Constitution and that Gould citizens are generally ignoring them. On Monday, July 18, 2011, Sonya Farley, a council member, said that the council plans to rewrite the ordinances in a manner that is constitutional. In August 2011 the city council repealed the ordinances.

Donna Terrell, a reporter at KLRT-TV Fox 16 News of Little Rock, said &quot;You&#x27;ve got to be kidding me&quot; when she heard about the ordinances. Terrell added that in communities &quot;where everyone knows everyone&quot; political conflict became very severe. Mark Hayes, the general counsel of the Arkansas Municipal League, said &quot;I&#x27;ve seen some humdingers, but never any ordinance like this.&quot; Robbie Brown of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that the ordinances are an indicator that Gould&#x27;s politics had become &quot;nasty&quot;. Brown added that legal scholars said that the law forbidding the formation of groups without the city council&#x27;s permission was blatantly unconstitutional.

On July 28, 2011, a man assaulted Nash, who accused his assailant of being allied with his political opponents. On Wednesday August 20, 2011, the two men were arrested in connection with the assault. One individual was originally charged with a felony but in April 2012 the charges were downgraded to a misdemeanor, and the other individual had his criminal charges dismissed.

===Federal representation===
The United States Postal Service operates the Gould Post Office.

==Education== 
Prior to the advent of court-mandated integration, separate schools were maintained for White and Black students. When courts ordered the schools to integrate, Gould established a &quot;freedom of choice plan&quot;. In 1968, the US Supreme court declared that Gould&#x27;s plan was unacceptable, and ordered Gould to integrate the schools without further delay. When the newly integrated schools opened September 2, most White students did not attend, instead waiting until October 1 to enroll in Southeast Academy, a hastily-organized, unaccredited segregation academy. Some White parents proposed reducing the property tax rate in order to defund the public schools and free up funds to support the segregation academy. In the fall of 1975 less than 70 students showed up for registration at Southeast Academy, and the school closed down.

Many White students transferred to districts that were more predominantly White; between 1982 and 1986 at least 115 children transferred to either Star City or Dumas. The result of the students transferring cost the school district around $100,000 per year in state funding, and left the district&#x27;s ability to meet state standards in doubt. Of the 148 students who attended the integrated high school on opening day in 1986, only one was White.

In 2004, the Gould School District was incorporated into the Dumas Public School District in accordance with a law passed by the Arkansas Legislature that eliminated school districts with fewer than 350 students. In the fall of 2005 the Dumas district planned to move all Gould students in grades 7-12 to the Dumas schools, and considered doing the same to the elementary school students from Gould.

==Bankruptcy==
In 2008 the town declared Chapter 9 bankruptcy.

<text>Ashdown (formerly Turkey Flats and Keller) is a city in Little River County, Arkansas, United States. The community was incorporated in 1892 and has been the county seat since 1906. Located within the Arkansas Timberlands between the Little River and the Red River, Ashdown&#x27;s economy and development have historically been tied to the timber industry. Timber is still a major industry here.

Ashdown&#x27;s population at the 2010 census was 4,723, a slight decrease from the 2000 census. The city&#x27;s well-preserved history and proximity to outdoor recreation, such as Millwood State Park, draws tourists.

==History==
Founded as a small farming community, Ashdown was initially known as Turkey Flats and later Keller before being renamed by Judge Lawrence Alexander Byrne. Following his Keller mill being &quot;burned down to ashes&quot;, Byrne vowed to rebuild and found a town named Ashdown. It was incorporated on June 11, 1892, as Ashdown. Rapid growth began in 1895 following the railroad reaching town. The Arkansas and Choctaw Railroad connected Ashdown to Arkinda. The growth of the Kansas City Southern Railway, the Frisco and the Memphis, Dallas and Gulf Railroad continued to stimulate the city and its timber industry. The railroads could carry more freight more quickly than had the steamboats and flatboats previously used to ship lumber to markets.

Following World War II, Ashdown&#x27;s economy began to diversify. Its location near two rivers attracted manufacturing plants, such as Coca-Cola bottling plant, box factory, clothing plant, ice plant and a pallet plant. 

The United States Army Corps of Engineers dammed the Little River and Saline River at their confluence in 1966, forming Millwood Lake. It is used for flood control and recreation. The lake&#x27;s recreational value attracted a Nekoosa Paper Company paper mill to the area two years later. It continues to operate today after being purchased by Domtar. The Little River Memorial Hospital was also built during this period of rapid building and development.

==Geography==

== History ==

Carved out of parts of Sevier County and Hempstead County, Little River County was established in 1867 by an act of the Arkansas legislature. The new county gave citizens a shorter and easier journey to their county seat of government. Because of the area&#x27;s close proximity to the Little River, which flows into the Red River near Texarkana (Miller County), it took the name of Little River County. This county is located in the southwest corner of the state and is surrounded by Sevier, Hempstead, Howard, and Miller counties in Arkansas and by counties in Texas and Oklahoma. The two rivers form major parts of the boundary of Little River County.

The land in and around Little River County is rich and fertile. It contains an abundance of lime formations in some areas near White Cliffs, Okay, and Foreman. In 1893, because of the available limestone, the Western Portland Cement Company once thrived at White Cliffs, though now only its ruins exist. Much later, because of the track of limestone running through Little River County, Sevier County, and Hempstead County, Ideal Cement Company was built in Okay. It made a quality cement for years but was later sold to a German company which did not want to make the costly repairs that were needed. At the same time that Ideal Cement Company was operating full scale, Foreman Cement Company, owned by Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company, was producing an abundance of quality cement. Eventually, Foreman Cement Company became the leading producer of cement in the southwest region of Arkansas. Today, it is still a thriving plant owned by Ash Grove Cement Company of Overland Park, Kansas. Ash Grove Cement has recently been acquired by CRH a publicly traded entity headquartered in Dublin, Ireland.

=== Louisiana Purchase through the Gilded Age ===
Some Caddo settlements existed in the area that would become Little River County, but the Caddo moved south out of the Great Bend area by 1778. The land continued to be regarded as Caddo territory, though, until a treaty in 1835. A Quapaw reservation also included parts of southwest Arkansas between 1820 and 1825, but that land eventually was exchanged for lands west of the territorial border. Even before treaties with the local Indian tribes were signed, settlers were developing the land. After the completion of these treaties, more civilized settlements and communities developed.

Pioneers had already begun settling in the area in the early 1800s. The first town to be plotted was Laynesport in 1836, on land donated for development by Benjamin Layne. By 1845, Willow Springs, later renamed Rocky Comfort, in the western part of the county, began to flourish, and by 1854, the community of Richmond had begun to thrive.

As they did throughout America, people suffered during the Civil War. They often experienced mental anguish and hardships because of the loss of lives and financial security. People in the South suspended raising cotton while other products were produced for the war efforts. Many lost property and experienced displacement.

After the legal establishment of Little River County in 1867, the first courthouse and jail in the county were located near the area that is now known as Alleene on land owned by the first sheriff, William M. Freeman. In 1868, Powell Clayton, governor of Arkansas, had all county records moved to established headquarters in Rocky Comfort.

In 1880, citizens of Richmond built a new courthouse. The property on which the courthouse was to be built was deeded to the county on the condition that Richmond would remain the county seat. After this courthouse burned, citizens of Richmond built another courthouse at no cost to the county because they wanted to keep the county seat in Richmond.

=== Early Twentieth Century ===
In 1902, the county seat was moved from Richmond to Foreman, formerly called Rocky Comfort. Foreman and Ashdown later competed for the county seat. When an election was held in 1906, Ashdown won the most votes to become the new county seat. After this election, records were moved from Foreman to a vacant building, known as the Mizell Building. A new courthouse was constructed in Ashdown in 1907.

On October 24, 1929, the New York stock market crash brought about the Great Depression. Little River County citizens suffered in much the same way as people in the rest of the country. Farms were lost, wages decreased, and unemployment increased. By 1932, income had dropped to one third of what it had been before October 1929. Many farmers were forced to sell their property during the 1930s. For years, the county&#x27;s principal source of income was agriculture. Cotton was the leading crop, and most of the early communities had cotton gins. Corn was the second-largest crop, but soon the timber industry would become the leading industry in the county. Many of the small settlements in Little River County were located near sawmills, cotton gins, or rivers.

The construction of railroads had a definite impact on the development of some towns and the decline of others. Little River County had its first railroad in 1889. In 1895, the Arkansas and Choctaw Railroad from Ashdown to Arkinda was built. The Kansas City Southern Railroad began running three new fast-freight locomotives with larger engines capable of pulling 100 loaded freight cars. With these modern engines, goods could more easily be transported, making the tough economic times in the 1930s more bearable. The presence of the Kansas City Southern Railroad, the St. Louis/San Francisco Railroad and the Memphis/Dallas and Gulf Railroad caused the county to grow rapidly. Before the construction of railroads, the rivers were used to transport goods by way of ferries, steamboats, and flatboats. Passenger trains began operating in the county in the late 1890s. After the emergence of railroads, electrical and telephone services became available to parts of the county by 1912, and natural gas came into Ashdown in 1930.

=== World War II through Modern Era ===
By 1950, manufacturing plants began to change the economy. The development of Millwood Lake in 1965 was of major importance to the county&#x27;s industrial growth. Access to water was a necessity for industry, and Ashdown&#x27;s rivers and lake provided plenty. Nekoosa Paper Mill was built in Ashdown in 1968 because of its access to the Red River. The plant was sold to Georgia-Pacific in 1991 and to Domtar Industries in 2001. Presently, the timber industry is paramount in Ashdown; Domtar Industries is a major employer there. Another key company, generating millions of dollars for the county, is Ash Grove Cement Company in Foreman. It was built in 1956 and rebuilt in 2010.

After the paper mill and the cement company came to Little River County, many citizens prospered. They began many building projects, including medical facilities. In 1958, the present Little River Memorial Hospital was constructed in Ashdown, and as of 2006, there are two nursing facilities and a retirement center. A new high school building, replacing the 1954 building, is under construction and is expected to be completed by 2007.

A modern bridge was constructed in 1980 over the Red River to replace the Index Bridge, built in 1919. Four-lane highways have encouraged easy access to Texarkana, now only a twenty-minute drive from Ashdown, which now has a bypass bridge to shorten the distance from Foreman to Texarkana.

Ashdown is home to the Cossatot Community College of the University of Arkansas. Millwood Lake and Millwood State Park are well known for trophy fishing contests and camping sites and sports facilities. The county courthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and it draws many tourists each Christmas season when the entire courthouse and its dome are covered in lights. Nine other properties are on the National Register, including the Hunter/Coulter House in Ashdown, the Will Reed House in Alleene, and the New Rocky Comfort House in Foreman. Ashdown recently established the Two Rivers Museum, which is a favorite tourist site, sponsored by the Little River County Historical Society.

== Politics ==
The city of Foreman has trended strongly Republican over the past several election cycles like the much of Arkansas. The last Democrat to carry the city of Foreman was John Kerry in 2004.
== Education ==

<text>Booneville is a city in Logan County, Arkansas, United States and the county seat of its southern district. Located in the Arkansas River Valley between the Ouachita and Ozark Mountains, the city is one of the oldest in western Arkansas.

The city was founded in 1828 when Walter Cauthron, an early explorer of the Arkansas Territory, built a log cabin and store along the Petit Jean River. By some accounts, he intended to name the community as &quot;Bonneville&quot; for friend Benjamin Bonneville, but the spelling and name were later changed. Another theory is that the name was to honor Daniel Boone, a friend of the Logan family for whom the county is named.

===2008 explosion of meat-packing plant===
On March 23, 2008, a fire set off multiple explosions at the Cargill Meat Solutions plant in Booneville.

==Education==

From its early days, Booneville has supported education. In 1874, as a response to needs for higher learning in western Arkansas, the Fort Smith District of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, authorized the establishment of the Fort Smith District High School in Booneville, 40 miles to the west. Local church members donated the land, building materials, and labor. The school, located on South College Street, was to be supported by student tuition fees. Students came from towns all over western Arkansas to board with Booneville families and attend a school that offered an advanced curriculum, including Latin, German, advanced mathematics, literature, and music. The school functioned until the early 1900s.

After the school closed, a group of residents and business leaders formed the Booneville Education Association and acquired of land in the northwest part of town. The new school was called the Booneville Co-Educational Institute and also offered a more advanced curriculum than the public school around. Graduates were admitted as sophomores at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville.

In 1920, state funds were made available for the support of public high schools and the school&#x27;s property was transferred to the Booneville School District. The building continued to be used as the city&#x27;s high school until a new building was built in 1929. The old Co-Educational Institute building was used as the Booneville elementary school for several decades after that.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

The city is located at the intersection of Highway 23 (commonly known as the &quot;Pig Trail&quot;) and Highway 10. Both routes are designated as Arkansas Scenic Byways near Booneville. Highway 217 also runs north and south from the city.

===Water/wastewater===
The city of Booneville owns the Booneville Water Department, which treats and distributes potable water from Lake Booneville to the residents and commercial users of the city in accordance with Arkansas Department of Health regulations.

The Booneville Water Department also collects and treats wastewater in accordance with a Clean Water Act National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit issued and administrated by the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality.

==History==

Pioneers settled the area about 1820. The village of Paris was formed on the Old Military Road between Little Rock and Fort Smith, and south of the Arkansas River. The Logan County seat, Paris, was named after the French capital in 1874. Paris was incorporated on February 18, 1879.

The villagers constructed a one-story frame courthouse. The town prison was constructed nearly three blocks from the courthouse, and remained the town&#x27;s prison for many years. The prison now serves as the Logan County Museum.

Coal mining flourished. In the 1890s, Paris was a bustling city of 800 people. Citizens boasted of two newspapers, a bottling-works company, nine general stores, and the Paris Academy. Coal mining was the community&#x27;s main industry by 1917, but had declined by the &#x27;60s. As a result, community leaders sought to diversify the town&#x27;s economic base. Today, the economy of Paris is benefitting from the presence of manufacturing facilities producing parts for the automotive and aerospace industries. Farming and ranching remain among the largest industries in the county, and tourism got a boost with the construction and opening of a 60-room lodge and guest cabins on the top of Mount Magazine, which is south of Paris. An estimated 400,000 people a year travelled to Mount Magazine State Park inn 2008.

Paris&#x27; schools have seen a steady increase in enrollment. The high school and middle school switched campuses to complete a promise to the patrons that was made in 1988.

Several interests have been made in the area by bauxite mining companies looking to reduce the costs of aluminum foil production.

===Last hanging in Arkansas===
Paris was the site of the last public hanging in Arkansas before the first electric chair came into use, in Little Rock.

In 1914, Paris was thrown into turmoil from the murder of a young girl from Delaware, Arkansas. A young man named Arthur Tillman was courting a girl named Amanda Stevens. She disappeared one evening from her home and was found about eight days later, partly submerged in water in a well on the farm of Ambrose Johnson. She was found with a large stone tied around her neck with telephone wire, a bullet through her head, and about a wagon load of rocks covering her body. The girl was believed to be alive when she was put into the well because her hands were filled with dirt that could only result from a struggle or attempting to free herself. On July 15, 1914, Arthur Tillman was hanged for the murder of his girlfriend, Amanda.

Today, the jail is a museum dedicated to Logan County history. Where spectators were located is now a road, joining to the main road, Highway 22. Visitors can tour through the entire building, jail keeper&#x27;s living quarters side and the jail side. It has many relics of Paris&#x27; past, such as farming equipment, clothing, and everyday objects from the settlers&#x27; lives, and exhibits of Native American, Civil War, and coal-mining artifacts.

===Paris Express===

The &quot;Paris Express&quot; was founded in 1880, one year after the community of Paris was established, and it is the oldest, continually operating business in the city. J.T. Perryman was the first publisher, and W.H.H. Harley was the first editor. During the next five years of its existence, it had several owners.

In 1885, the weekly &quot;Express&quot; was purchased from Charles Noble by William M. Greenwood, former publisher of the &quot;Chismville Star&quot; and an associate with the &quot;Fort Smith Daily Tribune&quot;. Greenwood published the &quot;Paris Express&quot; for 46 years until his death in 1929.

Hugh and J.C. Park of the &quot;Van Buren Press-Argus&quot; purchased the &quot;Express&quot; from the Greenwood estate and then sold it a few months later to Wallace D. Hurley. Hurley published the paper until 1939, when it was purchased by John Guion and Robert Breeden. Guion was editor and publisher of the &quot;Express&quot; and a sister paper, the &quot;Paris Progress&quot;, and in 1946 served as president of the Arkansas Press Association. At that time, the Paris company began publishing the Charleston and Greenwood papers.

The &quot;Progress&quot; was launched in 1910 and started out as a semiweekly. In 1920, it was renamed the &quot;Paris Progress&quot; and in 1927 became a weekly. The &quot;Paris Commercial Press&quot;, which was only in business during 1937, became consolidated with the &quot;Progress&quot;. It was also a weekly.

The papers were purchased in 1976 by Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc., of San Antonio, Texas. The &quot;Paris Express&quot; and the &quot;Paris Progress&quot; were combined into a biweekly bearing the name of &quot;Paris Express Progress&quot; in January 1977. The &quot;Paris Express Progress&quot; was sold in April 1988 to Westward Communications, a Dallas-based company.

The biweekly &quot;Paris Express Progress&quot; combined into a &quot;super&quot; weekly issue on May 17, 1989, called the &quot;Paris Express&quot;. In July 1997, Westward Communications sold to Westward Communications, LLC based out of The Woodlands, Texas.

Stephens Media Group purchased the &quot;Paris Express&quot; in March 2000. The company is based in Las Vegas, Nevada. During that timeframe The &quot;Paris Express&quot; had six full-time employees and a circulation of 3,600.

<text>Subiaco is a town in Logan County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 572 at the 2010 census.

The town is named after Subiaco Abbey, which is located there, and which donated in the early 20th century for a townsite and railroad connection. Founded as a priory in 1878, Subiaco Abbey was established and named by Pope Leo XIII in 1891, after the Italian city of that name in the Lazio region, where St. Benedict founded his first monastery. The town celebrated the arrival of its first train in June 1909.

==History==
The development of both the abbey and the town were related to the expansion of the Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad (LR&amp;FS) in the area in the late 19th century. In 1877, it owned thousands of acres in Arkansas through federal subsidies for railroad development, and wanted to attract German Catholic immigrants to the region as settlers. The railroad came to an agreement with Abbot Martin Marty, O.S.B., of St. Meinrad Archabbey in Indiana, to grant the abbey land in Logan County to establish a monastery and school to serve the hoped-for settlers. The railroad granted to the Benedictines to establish a monastery for monks, and an additional to found a convent for Benedictine nuns.

Although the Benedictine abbey and order are independent of the local diocese, as are all Catholic institutes, Edward Fitzgerald, Bishop of Diocese of Little Rock, supported the proposal. He needed German-speaking priests to serve the growing numbers of German immigrants in his diocese.

In March 1878, three monk-missionaries from St. Meinrad Archabbey settled here, founding what became known first as St. Benedict&#x27;s Priory. Another priest, and eight monastery candidates, joined them the following year. In 1886, the priory became independent of St. Meinrad&#x27;s, as a conventual priory. In 1891, Pope Leo XIII named the institute as an abbey, to be called Subiaco Abbey, after Subiaco, Italy, where St. Benedict had his first monastery.

German Catholic immigrants did settle in the area, generally working as farmers. They began to lobby for a direct railroad connection. The nearby town of Spierlerville, Arkansas, was the site of the local post office in the region. The Spieler family lobbied for the railroad to pass through their town.

The Prior of Subiaco Abbey, Fr. Wolfgang Schlumpf, O.S.B., had lobbied for the railroad to pass by the Abbey quarry so that it could have a viable commercial enterprise, but the railroad company chose a more level route that passed to the south of the Abbey property.

Subiaco Abbey donated of land to form the new town of Subiaco, where a railroad depot could be located. The depot and a new store, established by Conrad Elsken, formed the basis of the settlement. The Subiaco Development Company was established to sell related lands to the general public.

The first train arrived at Subiaco on June 22, 1909, and the official inauguration was on June 30, 1909. Abbot Ignatius Conrad of Subiaco Abbey drove the last spike for the railway connection. Dressed in full vestments, the Abbot also greeted passengers and blessed the train. Festivities included music by both the Subiaco band and the band from nearby Spielerville.

<text>Cabot is the largest city in Lonoke County, Arkansas, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population of the city was 23,776, and in 2019 the population was an estimated 26,352, ranking it as the state&#x27;s 19th largest city, behind Jacksonville. It is part of the Little Rock-North Little Rock-Conway metropolitan area.

== History ==
=== Prior to settlement ===
Before the city of Cabot existed, an 1862 typhoid epidemic took the lives of about 1,500 Confederate soldiers previously under Allison Nelson who were camped at Camp Nelson in the hills surrounding Cabot and Austin. In 1905, 428 poorly marked graves were exhumed by a group of Confederate veterans and moved to a new site at Camp Nelson Confederate Cemetery. Marble gravestones were placed over each grave and a large marble obelisk was erected to honor the dead. In 1982, a group of volunteers from Cabot began maintaining the cemetery, which had fallen into disrepair.

=== Early history ===
The city of Cabot sprang up as a small settlement around a refueling station on the Cairo &amp; Fulton Railroad after it bypassed Austin. The settlement first appeared in 1873 and is thought to have been named after railroad executive George Cabot Ward. The First Baptist Church was established in 1876, and the Cabot United Methodist Church in 1881. G. W. Grandberry began publication of the first newspaper in 1885, named &quot;The Guard&quot;. Grandberry, along with James Milton Park served as the towns medical doctors. By 1889 businesses began growing alongside the railroad tracks. Businesses included six general stores, two drugstores, a hotel owned by James Charles Boyd, James Adam&#x27;s livery stable, and the Neely brothers cotton gin. The Bank of Cabot (later merged into Centennial Bank) was founded in 1903. The city of Cabot was officially incorporated November 9, 1891, as the 139th city in Arkansas.

Cabot was often overshadowed in northern Lonoke County by what at the time was the much larger city of Austin (originally named Oakland). However, Cabot experienced growth during the 1950s and 1960s, due to its proximity to the Little Rock Air Force Base in nearby Jacksonville which opened in 1955, as well as due to the &quot;white flight&quot; occurring in response to the racial discord in Little Rock, Arkansas caused by school desegregation and its following crisis.

=== Bedroom community ===

In 1972, the Little Rock School District, slow to comply with the 1954 US Supreme Court case &quot;Brown v. Topeka Board of Education&quot;, was forcibly ordered by federal courts to immediately desegregate the school district. As a result, tensions rose and during the 1980s and 1990s Little Rock school district teachers repeatedly went on strike. A &quot;white exodus&quot; occurred with many residents choosing to relocate to smaller communities around Little Rock, including Cabot, Benton, Bryant, Conway, and Maumelle instead of choosing to continue supporting full integration. Over time, new arrivals to the state chose to live in these towns (now veritable suburbs) because, by some educational indicators, the school districts were more successful.

Cabot received many of the families that were relocating during that time period. As a result, a &quot;commuter culture&quot; developed because many residents that had children in Cabot schools made the commute to Little Rock to work daily. 40% of military personnel working at the Little Rock Air Force Base in Jacksonville live in Cabot because of the higher cost of living in Little Rock and Jacksonville. This, coupled with the perceived higher quality of life and easily accessed work opportunity, has resulted in a &quot;boomtown.&quot; As more people moved to Cabot to join the commuter culture, the tax base grew and, as a result, the Cabot School District steadily developed into one of the top-performing districts in the state.

Currently, the Cabot School District encompasses the north end of Lonoke County. The bulk of the county&#x27;s population today can be found in approximately the same area, containing the county&#x27;s most populous and second most populous cities — Cabot and Ward, respectively — in addition to Austin, which are among Arkansas&#x27; fastest growing communities.

=== Recent history ===
A devastating tornado hit downtown Cabot during the afternoon of March 29, 1976, killing five people and destroying multiple buildings. During the rebuilding of the city, it was decided to build a new city hall, municipal courtroom, library (since relocated), and police station on the site of the debris-filled dividing point between the east and west sections of Main Street, creating City Plaza. Arkansas Highway 89, which follows the same path as West Main Street in Cabot, was redirected around City Plaza along one block of Second Street, to continue its path along Pine Street just south of the Cabot High School campus.

Cabot&#x27;s population has more than quintupled from the 1980s to today, from under 5,000 residents to over 26,000. New housing starts, as seen by new subdivided developments, now cover the town.

On August 10, 2006, Cabot Junior High School North experienced a devastating fire which was believed to have started as a small electrical fire in the library caused by a faulty light bulb. Although there were 100 people in the building at the time, there were no injuries. The building burned from 2:30 p.m. to about 9:00 p.m., and the structure was a total loss. Cabot Fire and Police Departments say that this is one of the worst structure fires to have ever occurred in Cabot. The school was only about eight years old. It was rebuilt and reopened about three years later.

The average household size was 2.78 and the average family size was 3.14.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 31.5% under the age of 18, 7.6% from 18 to 24, 34.0% from 25 to 44, 19.0% from 45 to 64, and 7.9% who were 65 years of age or older.

==Arts and culture ==
Cabot has a movie theater that was built in the late 1990s, plus a growing number of restaurants, amateur sporting venues and community organizations. A new multimillion-dollar library/public meeting complex was completed and opened in 2015. The city has golf courses adjoining Greystone Country Club in the city&#x27;s north end, and near Rolling Hills Country Club in southeast Cabot. Both of the country clubs and the Veterans of Foreign Wars post are exceptions to Cabot&#x27;s legal status as part of a dry county, which prohibits the sale of alcoholic beverages elsewhere in the city.

One of the city&#x27;s biggest events, staged in the downtown area each October, is Cabotfest — a community fair that has grown in popularity as the city&#x27;s population has swelled over the years since the tornado. A similar event called Strawberry Fest is held annually in the spring. Cabot is part of the small area in Arkansas along highway 67/167 where strawberries were grown in abundance and sold in other parts of the country during the early part of the 20th Century due in large part to the arrival of the railroad.

Adam Richman, the host of &quot;Man vs. Food&quot; on the Travel Channel, came to Cabot&#x27;s Mean Pig BBQ during the Season 2 &quot;Little Rock&quot; episode which aired on November 25, 2009, to try the Shut-Up Juice Challenge, which involves a large smoked pulled pork sandwich topped with coleslaw and &quot;Shut-Up Juice&quot; - barbecue sauce mixed with a tablespoon of concentrated, undiluted habanero extract.

There are 43 churches in Cabot. This gives the city a person-to-church ratio of 618 people per church.

==Education==
Cabot Public Schools serves students in the communities of Cabot, Austin, and Ward, as well as most of northern Lonoke County. The Cabot Public School District has been designated as a Purple Star School District for its support of military families, particularly those serving at the Little Rock Air Force Base.

<text>Lonoke () is the second most populous city in Lonoke County, Arkansas, United States, and serves as its county seat. According to 2010 United States Census, the population of the city is 4,245. It is part of the Little Rock–North Little Rock–Conway Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Lonoke&#x27;s history begins with the advance of Union troops through Central Arkansas during the American Civil War. The town of Brownsville was burned to the ground by Union forces after the retreat of Confederate forces westward to Little Rock. After the war, it was decided by the city leaders of Brownsville that a new town should be formed by the nearby railroad so that those who wished to stay could do so.

According to local legend, the town was named for a large red oak tree that was found while trees were being chopped down in order to build houses. The official name of the city was originally Lone Oak. However, due to a misprint in the &quot;Lonoke Democrat&quot; newspaper, the town&#x27;s name was printed as Lonoak. Eventually, this misspelling became further misspelled as Lonoke.

The town of Lonoke was very slow to grow. Lonoke maintained a sustainable population through the support of its agricultural based economy until World War II. Because of the baby boom, Lonoke&#x27;s population began to reach higher numbers. Furthermore, Lonoke became a sort of suburban area of Little Rock due to the implementation of the Interstate Highway System and the construction of Interstate 40.

In recent years, the population of Lonoke has remained in the area of about 4,000 people. As the Little Rock metropolitan area continues to grow, Lonoke&#x27;s population is expected to grow as well as Lonoke is becoming more suitable as a suburban area.

Eberts Field, used by the United States Army for pilot training during World War I and World War II, was located near Lonoke.

==Geography==
Lonoke is in central Lonoke County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (6.07%) is water.

==Government==
Lonoke is governed by a mayor-council form of city government, in which a mayor, other city administrators, and an eight-member city council are all regularly elected. The city is divided into eight districts (analogous to wards in other cities), each represented on the council by an alderman. In addition to the mayor, the city&#x27;s clerk, treasurer, attorney and district judge are also popularly elected.

==Education==

By 1879, the town of Lonoke had grown large enough to recognize the need for free public education. Since the state provided only limited funding, the citizens of Lonoke raised an additional $10,000 through private contributions. Together with the state funds, this money made it possible to start a free public school in the town, offering classes for ten months each year. 

The city of Lonoke lacks post secondary institutions due to its small population and rural nature. However, Lonoke does feature a public school district that includes a primary, elementary, middle, and high school. According to the National Institute for Higher Education, Lonoke High School has an average ACT score of 22. However, over 89% of the graduating class of high school from 1987 to 2007 has been accepted to an institution of higher education. Of those 89%, approximately 45% have attended Arkansas State University Beebe.

In addition to its public school system, Lonoke is home to the main campus of the Lonoke Exceptional School, which offers learning opportunities for children and adults with various developmental disabilities. The school has served Lonoke and surrounding areas since 1972; its main campus in downtown Lonoke was built in 1991.

<text>Scott is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Lonoke and Pulaski counties in the central part of the U.S. state of Arkansas. Per the 2020 census, the population was 97. It is part of the Little Rock–North Little Rock–Conway Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

More than 1,000 years ago, a complex formation of mounds was created near what is now called Mound Pond by what is today known as the Plum Bayou culture, a Pre-Columbian Native American culture that lived in what is now east-central Arkansas from 650–1050 CE, a time known as the Late Woodland Period. Archaeologists defined the culture based on the Toltec Mounds site The site was farmed in the nineteenth century but was later preserved as Plum Bayou Mounds Archeological State Park.

The Arkansas River not only created distinctive oxbow lakes, but it also provided rich farmland that was attractive to the first white settlers in Arkansas Territory. Peter L. Lefevre and family were among the very first French settlers, locating in the fall of 1818 on the north side of the river on Spanish Grant No. 497, about six miles below Little Rock. Chester Ashley was one of the first investors to acquire land in the area for plantation purposes in the early 1800s. Conoway Scott Sr., for whom the community is named, arrived in the 1830s. Thomas Steele began his plantation in the area in 1850.

The Marmaduke–Walker duel occurred in the area on September 6, 1863, on the Lefevre Plantation, just east of the Lefevre House. The duel was fought between John S. Marmaduke and Lucius M. Walker, two generals in the Confederate States Army. Tension had risen between the two officers during the Battle of Helena on July 4, 1863, when Marmaduke accused Walker of not supporting his force, and then retaliated by not informing Walker of a Confederate retreat. Marmaduke was later assigned to serve under Walker during a Union advance against Little Rock. Walker did not support Marmaduke during a retreat after the Battle of Brownsville, and Marmaduke questioned Walker&#x27;s courage after the Battle of Bayou Meto on August 27. A series of notes passed between the two generals by friends resulted in a duel, during which Marmaduke fatally wounded Walker. Marmaduke was arrested and charged with murder, but was soon released and later the charge was dropped.

The Skirmish at Ashley&#x27;s Mills, also known as the Skirmish at Ferry Landing was an engagement that was fought between Union Army and Confederate States Army cavalry regiments in Arkansas on September 7, 1863, during the American Civil War. Federal troops approached Little Rock from the north, encountering resistance from Confederate forces at Battle of Brownsville, Arkansas on August 25 and at Bayou Meto, near present-day Jacksonville, Arkansas on August 27. Union Brigadier-General  John W. Davidson commanding the cavalry division of the Union Army of Arkansas sent the 7th Missouri Volunteer Cavalry Regiment as his lead regiment to clear the 5th Arkansas Cavalry Regiment, under the temporary command of Major John Bull while Colonel Robert C. Newton was in temporary brigade command, from its position guarding a crossing of the Arkansas River near Little Rock, Arkansas. The Union cavalry forced the Confederates to retreat which opened the route to the east of the river, leading to the Battle of Bayou Fourche on September 10, 1863, and the capture of Little Rock by the Union Army of Arkansas under the command of Major General Frederick Steele. The Confederate regiment&#x27;s casualties were 1 killed, 3 wounded and 2 captured while the Union regiment reported no casualties.

The St. Louis Southwestern Railway (known as the Cotton Belt Route) was constructed through the Scott area in 1871. The new station was located on the property of Conoway Scott Sr. The railroad depot was called Scott’s Station (or Scott’s Crossing). 

In 1912, Conoway Scott Jr. built a large brick building, intending to house a general store. The store later opened under the Foster Family as Foster&#x27;s General Store. A post office was added to the store in 1929. Later the name of the surrounding community was shortened to Scott.

==Geography==
Scott is located in western Lonoke County and eastern Pulaski County and is bordered to the west by the city of North Little Rock. U.S. Route 165 passes through the community, leading northwest approximately to Interstate 440 and southeast to Keo. Downtown Little Rock is west of Scott. Downtown North Little Rock, Arkansas is west. Interstate 40 in Arkansas is north at Galloway, Arkansas. Arkansas Highway 161 runs concurrently with the Lonoke-Pulaski county line in the community, progressing northward to U.S. Route 70 and southeast to England, by way of farming areas in southeast Pulaski County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Scott CDP has a total area of , of which are land and (4.52%) are water. The CDP&#x27;s portion in Pulaski County is bisected by Horseshoe Lake, an oxbow lake that was once a channel of the Arkansas River.

The zoned schools are Harris Elementary School, Mills Middle School, and Wilbur D. Mills High School.

==Points of interest==

The Arkansas Department of Parks Heritage &amp; Tourism operates two facilities in the Scott area, one on the Pulaski County side and the other on the Lonoke County side, each with a focus on local history:
* Plantation Agriculture Museum, located on the Pulaski County side, displays artifacts from Arkansas&#x27;s agricultural history in large farming operations, particularly cotton cultivation. The museum is housed in a circa-1912 general store building, and also features a restored 1912 cotton gin, Seed Warehouse #5, and chronicles the period from Arkansas&#x27;s statehood to the end of World War II focusing on tenant farming and agricultural mechanization.
* Plum Bayou Mounds Archeological State Park, located on the Lonoke County side, focuses on the site of a Native American civilization that lived just east of present-day Scott nearly 1,000 years ago. Mounds at the park comprise one of the most significant remnants of Native American life in the state, and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Arkansas Archeological Survey, part of the University of Arkansas system, maintains its Plum Bayou Research Station and laboratory in the park&#x27;s visitor center.
Additionally, the history of Scott can be found at other sites around the community. 
* Immediately northeast of Scott Charter School on the Pulaski County side is the Scott Plantation Settlement, a grouping of relocated buildings including the wooden Cotton Belt Railroad Depot that served Scott, collected to represent the area&#x27;s plantation-era heritage (much in the same fashion as Little Rock&#x27;s Historic Arkansas Museum).
* Marlsgate Plantation, also known as the Dortch Plantation, is the area&#x27;s best known example of a plantation family home, constructed on the Lonoke County side. In 1885, William Pinkney Dortch married into the more influential Steele family. By 1904, Dortch had established a new plantation, centered around a mansion named Marlsgate built on Bearskin Lake, which was designed by architect Charles L. Thompson. It is a popular site for weddings and receptions today. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.
*Longbridge Plantation is an Estate home, also known as the Charles Alexander House, located on the Pulaski County side. It was designed by the Charles L. Thompson architectural firm for Charles Newton Alexander around 1906 on Hills Lake in Young Township, Scott, Arkansas, just east of Galloway, Arkansas along Highway 70. Alexander moved to Pulaski County in In 1879 at 21 years old. He began farming upon arrival and added to his original holdings, until he became one of the largest and most influential land owners in central Arkansas. Alexander was President of the Rose City Cotton Oil Mills, director in the Exchange National Bank of Little Rock Exchange Bank Building (Little Rock, Arkansas), and a director of the Arkansas Cotton Growers Association. He was also on the Highway Commission of Arkansas.
*James Robert Alexander, who had settled in the area in 1882, built Land&#x27;s End Plantation (Scott, Arkansas) in 1925; its central house was designed by John Parks Almand. It is a 5,000-acre (2,000 ha) working plantation, located on the banks of the Arkansas River. The main plantation complex includes a 1925 Tudor Revival house, and more than 20 outbuildings. AR 161, which passes close to the main house, is lined by pecan trees planted about 1900 by Alexander. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1999.
* The All Souls Church (Scott, Arkansas) Interdenominational Chapel is an architectural gem from the turn of the twentieth century. It was designed by Charles L. Thompson and built by George Leifer. Conoway Scott donated land for a new church building, and Charles N. Alexander donated construction materials. The cornerstone was laid on June 27, 1906. The first service in All Souls Church was held on January 13, 1907, led by Methodist minister Forney Hutchinson. Situated along the county line, the church building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and has been in continuous use by the congregation since 1907.

*The Fred and Lucy Alexander Schaer House and Ashley-Alexander House (located in nearby Galloway, Arkansas), and The Cotham House located in Scott are historic homes located in the area with connections to historic local families.

*Prior to a fire that destroyed the structure in 2017, Cotham&#x27;s Mercantile Store, a widely known community restaurant favored by former President Bill Clinton, and famous for its Hubcap Burgers and Mississippi Mud Pie, was housed in a former general store building constructed in 1912, and displayed multiple antique farm implements.

==Longbridge Plantation==

Longbridge is an Estate home, also known as the Charles Alexander House, located on Hills Lake in Young Township, Scott, Arkansas, just east of Galloway, Arkansas along Highway 70.

==History==
Yellville is named after Archibald Yell, who was the first member of the United States House of Representatives from Arkansas and the second governor of Arkansas.

Marion County was formed in 1836, shortly after statehood. Shawneetown was then renamed Yellville. An old tale claims Archibald Yell offered $50 to do so, but never paid the money. True or not, Governor Yell&#x27;s descendants heard the story and paid the overdue &quot;bill&quot; several years ago. Yell&#x27;s name can be seen elsewhere in the state, including Yell County and Archibald Yell Boulevard in Fayetteville. Several biographies of him have been written, the most recent published by the University of Arkansas Press in Fayetteville.

During the late 1840s, Yellville was the scene of several prolonged gunfights during the Tutt–Everett War. John A. Schnabel organized his Confederate cavalry battalion in the town in 1863.

In the early morning of July 17th, 2024; Marion County received just under a foot of rainfall in a considerable flash flooding event. During the event, bridges and homes were reportedly washed out in Yellville, including a nursing home due to the high waters.

<text>Fouke is a city in Miller County, Arkansas, United States. It is part of the Texarkana, Texas - Texarkana, Arkansas Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 810 in 2024

==Geography==
Fouke is located in central Miller County, along U.S. Highway 71. Interstate 49 passes just to the west of the city limits and serves the city with two exits. Fouke is southeast of Texarkana and about north of Shreveport, Louisiana, by either highway. The Red River passes less than to the east and south of Fouke.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

== History ==
The area around Fouke had long been inhabited by the Native American Caddo people, prior to European colonization of the Americas. Caddo tribes and European explorers traded pelts, honey, beeswax, flour, tobacco, blankets, guns, and other items. After the Louisiana Purchase, the United States established the Sulphur Fork Factory (trading post) where the Sulphur River enters the Red River. In the years following Arkansas statehood, settlers began flowing steadily into the area and the Caddo population was greatly diminished.

In 1889, Seventh Day Baptist minister James Franklin Shaw and his followers were seeking an area to establish a new colony. In 1890, they chose a site along the Texarkana, Shreveport and Natchez Railroad, where a small timber line ended at Fouke&#x27;s Sawmill. The streets were named for prominent, nationally known Baptists, and upon advertising the area with the offer of reasonably priced land, affordable lumber, and free railroad passage, pioneers traveled to the area from as far away as Idaho, Illinois, and West Virginia.

James H. Fouke, a Presbyterian entrepreneur, lumberman, and railroad executive, helped them establish their colony, and in 1902 he donated land for a school. The city of Fouke was named in his honor.

By the early 1920s, the farming and timber industries had brought people of many faiths to the community. A new Texas and Pacific Railroad depot was constructed in 1906, and the community was incorporated in 1911. Population growth increased during the 1920s oil boom, and in 1928 construction of U.S. Route 71 further increased Fouke&#x27;s employment opportunities.

During the Prohibition era of 1920–1936, Fouke suffered violent deaths of many men in relation to the illegal trafficking of liquor. Interstate commerce was not well coordinated during that time, which made Fouke&#x27;s location attractive to those who would commit crimes and then cross the adjoining border(s).

Since the 1920s, Fouke has had a reputation as a sundown town.

The Fouke State Bank was chartered in 1914, but it went broke during the Great Depression, and job losses in the community caused many to accept work as part of Depression-era programs such as the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Progress Administration. It was not until World War II that large numbers of the citizens found employment at the newly established Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant and Red River Army Depot, which were located just west of Texarkana.

Since its incorporation, the city of Fouke has seen many improvements to its infrastructure. Dirt and gravel streets were paved in 1958. A new city hall, jail, and fire station were constructed in 1962. A new &quot;Deep-Well&quot; water system was completed in 1966, and the city&#x27;s sewer system was completed in 1988.

In 1972, Fouke received national attention when Charles B. Pierce produced a movie called &quot;The Legend of Boggy Creek&quot;. The movie chronicled the alleged existence of a large, hairy, ape-like creature called the &quot;Fouke Monster&quot;. A number of local citizens were cast, and the movie used area wetlands, rivers, and creeks for its location.

In 2001 Fouke celebrated the grand opening of the Fouke Community Center, and the grand opening of the Miller County Historical and Family Museum was celebrated in 2003.

In 2010, Fouke citizens dedicated the Veterans Memorial Park. The memorial covers two-thirds of a city block. It is a perpetually flagged and lighted monument that contains a growing list of veterans&#x27; names and military histories.

In 2011, local groups such as the Citizens for a Better Community raised funds to provide improvements that include &quot;Welcome&quot; signs on Highway 71 at the north and south ends of the city, along with various beautification and community service projects. They purchased one of Fouke&#x27;s historic homes with a plan to renovate and restore it to create an events center and community library. By that time, the Fouke School District had become the city&#x27;s largest employer, with more than 1,000 students and more than 165 employees.

In 2013, Fouke began the Boggy Creek Festival to promote the local area, bring together the community, and to share information and humor about the &quot;Fouke Monster&quot;.

<text>Texarkana is a city in the U.S. state of Arkansas and the county seat of Miller County, on the southwest border of the state. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 29,387. It is the twin city of Texarkana, Texas, located just across the state line. The city was founded at a railroad intersection on December 8, 1873, and was incorporated in Arkansas on August 10, 1880. Texarkana and its Texas counterpart are the principal cities of the Texarkana metropolitan area, which in 2021 was ranked 289th in the United States with a population of 147,174, according to the United States Census Bureau.

Within the Ark-La-Tex subregion of southwest Arkansas, Texarkana is located in the Piney Woods, an oak–hickory forest that dominates the flat Gulf Coastal Plain. Texarkana&#x27;s economy is based on agriculture. The city has long been a trading center, first located at the intersection of major railroads serving Texas, Arkansas and north into Missouri. Since then three major Interstate highways constructed crossroads here: Interstate 30 (I-30), I-49, and the future I-69. The Red River Army Depot is the largest single employer in the city.

The Texarkana Arkansas School District is the largest public school district on the Arkansas side. The city has a branch campus of the University of Arkansas Hope-Texarkana (UAHT). Texarkana College is located on the Texas side.

==History==

Miller County was formed in 1820 in the Arkansas Territory; it was named in honor of James Miller, Arkansas&#x27; first territorial governor and a general during the War of 1812. Much of its eastern border is formed by the Red River. At the time, there was considerable uncertainty among Americans as to the location of the boundary between the county (and the United States) and national territory of Mexico, which then included Texas.

Consequently, settlers believed that Arkansas levied and collected taxes on land that eventually might be held by Mexico. Moreover, many who resented what they considered Mexican oppression of European-American Texans were openly declaring allegiance to the Texans.

After the Texas Republic gained independence from Mexico, regional unrest increased. In 1838, Governor James Conway proposed that the &quot;easiest and most effective remedy is the abolition of Miller County to an area which is more patriotic.&quot; Miller County was dissolved and its land was made part of Lafayette County, Arkansas.

In 1873 town lots were sold in Texarkana, Arkansas, at the intersection of two railroads, which stimulated its growth as a trading center. In this area and time period, railroads had replaced rivers as the preferred method of transportation and shipping, and new towns were sited for best advantage via the railroad. The next year (1874), Texarkana, Texas, was founded on the rail line on June 12 across the state border.

That same year, the Arkansas legislature re-established Miller County. Efforts of the young town in Arkansas to be incorporated were not realized until October 17, 1880, nearly seven years after Texarkana, Texas, was formed. Both Texarkana cities generally recognize December 8, 1873, as the date of organization.

On February 11, 1922, masked men lynched Mr. Norman, an African-American man, in Texarkana, Miller County, Arkansas. Lynchings were perpetrated by white men primarily against black males, although some black women were also lynched in the South.

<text>Blytheville is one of two county seat and the largest city in Mississippi County, Arkansas, United States. It is approximately north of West Memphis. The population was 13,406 at the 2020 census, down from 15,620 in 2010.

==History==
Blytheville was founded by Methodist clergyman Henry T. Blythe in 1879. It received a post office the same year, was incorporated in 1889, and became the county seat for the northern half of Mississippi County (Chickasawba District) in 1901. Blytheville received telephone service and electricity in 1903, and natural gas service in 1950.

Forestry was an early industry, spurred by the massive harvesting of lumber needed to rebuild Chicago following the Great Fire of 1871. The lumber industry brought sawmills and a rowdy crowd, and the area was known for its disreputable saloon culture during the 1880s and 1890s. The Paragould Southeastern Railway, which served the logging industry, arrived in town in 1907.

The cleared forests enabled cotton farming to take hold, encouraged by ongoing levee building and waterway management; the population grew significantly after 1900. On Blytheville&#x27;s western edge lies one of the largest cotton gins in North America. Soybeans and rice have also become important crops.

The area northwest of the town was developed into an &quot;advanced&quot; pilot training school for the Army Air Forces in 1942. The school hosted the BT-13, AT-6, AT-9, and AT-10. The facility closed after the end of WW2 and briefly served as the city&#x27;s municipal airport.

The area around Blytheville continues to be farmed, though family farms have given way to large factory operations.

The former Blytheville Army Airfield was reopened by the Air Force in 1956 as Blytheville Air Force Base, and from 1959 to 1991 hosted the 97th Wing as part of the Strategic Air Command&#x27;s Ground Alert Program. The base was closed in December 1992 as part of the 1991 BRAC Commission.In the 1980s, Blytheville began to develop an industrial base, much of which centered on the steel industry. Nucor Steel opened a plant east of Blytheville, on the Mississippi River, in 1987. 
James Sanders was elected as the mayor of Blytheville in 2011. He was the first African-American to serve in that position. After James Sanders’ retirement in 2023, local accountant and veteran Melissa Logan was elected as the city’s first female black mayor.

<text>Dyess is a town in Mississippi County, Arkansas, United States. Founded as Dyess Colony in 1934 by the Federal Emergency Relief Administration as part of the Roosevelt administration&#x27;s agricultural relief and rehabilitation program, it was the largest agrarian community established by the U.S. during the Great Depression.

As of the 2020 census, the population of Dyess was 339, down from 410 in 2010. Dyess Colony was the boyhood home of country music singer Johnny Cash.

==History==

===Establishment===

Dyess Colony was established in Mississippi County in 1934 as part of the New Deal efforts of Franklin D. Roosevelt to provide economic relief to destitute workers in the Great Depression. The experiment was the largest such community-building experiment established by the federal government during these years.

The project was established by Mississippi politician and cotton planter William R. Dyess (1890–1936), director of the Arkansas Emergency Relief Administration, who initially sought the establishment of a self-supporting agricultural community housing 800 families upon unused Mississippi Delta farmland. Director Dyess established the entity remembered to history as &quot;Dyess Colony&quot; and as &quot;Colonization Project No. 1&quot;, plans for which were submitted to chief of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) Harry Hopkins early in 1934. The project was approved by Hopkins in March 1934.

Some of unimproved land were purchased by Dyess for the colonization project at the cost of $9.05 per acre, with the parcel redeemed for the payment of unpaid back taxes in this amount. The site consisted primarily of swamp and cutover forest land, although containing deep topsoil deposited by the Mississippi River, part of what was then the most productive cotton farming county in the entire United States.

The project&#x27;s scope was immediately scaled back to 500 family parcels, with the participants to be recruited from Arkansas sharecroppers and tenant farmers from across the entire state. Thousands of applicants were carefully screened, and eligibility requirements included being an experienced farmer made destitute through no fault of his own and being an Arkansas resident &quot;of good moral background&quot; in good health, under the age of 50, and white. Funds for the purchase of land were provided by FERA in the form of a grant to the Arkansas Emergency Relief Administration, which initially managed the project. Subsequently, a new entity was established known as Dyess Colony Inc., the stock of which was held in trust by the US Secretary of Agriculture, and management and control passed over to the managing board of that company.

The main purpose of the town&#x27;s administration was to give poor white families a chance to start over with land that they could work toward owning. The original township included 500 individually owned and operated farms which were 20 or 40 acres each.

===Early administrative structure===

The colony was carefully planned and administered by Dyess and a board of directors, who managed the day-to-day activities of the colonists. A turnover of this top leadership took place on January 14, 1936, however, when Dyess and his top lieutenant, chief accountant and finance director Robert H. McNair Jr., were killed in an airplane crash returning to Arkansas from Washington, DC.

After his death, leadership of the Dyess Colony passed to Little Rock attorney and Arkansas Department of Labor statistician Floyd Sharp, a personal friend of Dyess, and Lawrence Westbrook, a Texas rancher who had been recruited by Harry Hopkins to work at FERA. Westbrook was fired by Hopkins in 1937 for a highly absentee work ethic and for attempting to imperially micromanage the colony&#x27;s affairs from his desk in Washington.

Two cooperative associations were incorporated by the board of directors of Dyess Colony Inc. — a consumer cooperative which operated a colony store and other businesses and a producer cooperative which coordinated the processing and sale of cotton farmed by residents of the colony. The colony also launched its own cooperative credit union not later than 1938.

===Dissolution===

The Dyess Colony gained a powerful opponent in the form of Governor Carl E. Bailey, a rival and political opponent of Floyd Sharp. It was the governor and his allies who persuaded the directors of Dyess Colony Inc. to incorporate under Arkansas rather than Delaware law — an action which later made the colony vulnerable to punitive bureaucratic attack. Multiple attempts were made in the Arkansas legislature to undermine and disestablish the Dyess colony, an effort culminating on March 10, 1939, when the Arkansas Corporation Commission, serving at Gov. Bailey&#x27;s pleasure, revoked the Dyess charter for failing to file reports for three years and failing to pay an $11 annual corporation fee.

In an effort to avoid additional capricious action, a new legal entity called the Dyess Rural Rehabilitation Corporation (DRRC) was established, to which Dyess Colony Inc. sold its assets. This succeeded in saving the non-profit colony until the DRRC was absorbed by the Farm Security Administration (FSA) in 1944. The federal aspect of the project was formally terminated in 1951.

<text>Gosnell is a city in northern Mississippi County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 2,910 at the 2020 census, down from 3,548 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
In the 1870s, a portion of the area east of what became the city of Gosnell was constituted as the North Sawba Cemetery. Much of the land between Blytheville and Big Lake was purchased in the late 1800s by Lemael W. Gosnell, a dentist and pioneer farmer. In time, the community came to be named for him. A Tennessee native, L.W. Gosnell originally came to Mississippi County in 1876, working as a store clerk at Barfield Landing and Blytheville before becoming a partner in a general store in Blytheville. 

The small community received its first railroad service sometime prior to 1903, after the Paragould and Southeastern Railroad extended its line from Hornersville, Missouri to Chickasawba, Arkansas (now eastern Blytheville).

By the mid-1920&#x27;s, the community, now formally known as Gosnell, opened its own one room schoolhouse. For over a decade, the school was overseen by Superintendent C.F. Cooper, who oversaw the growth of the school and the addition of a high school curriculum by the time of his retirement in 1930. During the 1937 flood, the community hosted 300 homeless victims of the flood. It was reported that a large number of wild animals had fled from the eastern section of the county after a break in the levee resulted in flooding from the Mississippi River.

In 1942, the U.S. Army came to Mississippi County to survey for land to construct a pilot training school. By April of that year, they had notified 62 individual land owners in the Gosnell community that their land was being taken by the federal government. By June, Blytheville Army Airfield, a B-25 pilot training facility with three runways, was in operation. The school closed in 1946, and was converted into a suburb. The facility reopened in 1954 as Blytheville Air Force Base, a B-57 and later B-52 base.

Gosnell was incorporated as a first-class city on March 12, 1968. Gosnell&#x27;s first mayor after incorporation was Andy Bevill.

==Geography==
Gosnell is located in the Arkansas Delta in northern Mississippi County. It is bordered to the east by the city of Blytheville, the county seat. The Missouri state line is less than to the north. According to the United States Census Bureau, Gosnell has a total area of , all land.

Ecologically, Gosnell is located within the St. Francis Lowlands ecoregion near its border with the Northern Holocene Meander Belts ecoregion; both are subregions of the larger Mississippi Alluvial Plain. The St. Francis Lowlands are a flat region mostly covered with row crop agriculture today, though also containing sand blows and sunken lands remaining from the 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes. Waterways have mostly been channelized, causing loss of aquatic and riparian wildlife habitat. The Big Lake National Wildlife Refuge, which preserves some of the bottomland hardwood forest typical of this ecoregion prior to development for row agriculture, lies west of Gosnell.
=== Historical sites ===
Leaving Blytheville on Chickasawba Street, one reaches Gosnell Road. Upon traveling one comes to the place of the famous Chickasawba Indian Mound 25 feet high and base circumference approximately 130 feet. This mound most likely served as either a Signal or a Temple Mound as no pottery or skeleton bones have been found here.

==Demographics==
===2010 census===
As of the census of 2010, there were 3,548 people, 1,387 households, and 951 families residing in the city. The racial makeup of the city was 72.9% White, 22.0% Black or African American, 0.4% Native American, 1.0% Asian, 1.6% from other races, and 2.1% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.5% of the population.

<text>Manila is a city in Mississippi County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 3,682 at the 2020 census, up from 3,342 in 2010. It was the hometown of World War I sniper Herman Davis. 

==History==
Manila has its origins in a herdsman&#x27;s camp established by John Needham in the late 1860s. By the late 1890s, a community known as &quot;Cinda&quot; (named after an early postmaster&#x27;s sister) had developed in the area. In 1901, this community incorporated as a city, and chose the name &quot;Manila&quot; to honor Commodore George Dewey&#x27;s 1898 victory in the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish–American War.

In the early 1900s, the Jonesboro, Lake City and Eastern Railroad (later part of the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway system) extended a rail line to Manila. In 1910, the Manila Depot was constructed by the railroad. This train station now serves as a museum, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1925, a memorial was established in the city for Herman Davis. The memorial was designated a state park in 1953, and the Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism is responsible for its maintenance.

==Geography==

The city is situated at the intersection of Arkansas Highway 18 and Arkansas Highway 77, south of the Arkansas–Missouri state line.

<text>Osceola is a city in, and a dual county seat of, Mississippi County, Arkansas, United States. Located along the Mississippi River within the Arkansas Delta, the settlement was founded in 1837 and incorporated in 1853. Occupying an important location on the river, the city&#x27;s economy grew as steamboat traffic increased. Timber and cotton harvesting would develop, and the city experienced rapid growth and development throughout the early 20th century. The city&#x27;s economy has since diversified to include a robust industrial sector. The population was 6,976 at the 2020 census, down from 7,757 in 2010.

==History==

===Prehistory===

During the prehistoric period, Osceola and Mississippi County were largely swampland, with dense forest cover. The area was inhabited by Native American tribes. Europeans arrived around the time of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.

===Louisiana Purchase through Statehood===

Initial white visitors to the area were speculators, hunters, and outlaws, but the remote region remained sparsely populated by settlers. The extremely intense New Madrid earthquake swarm, produced by the New Madrid Seismic Zone nearby in present-day Missouri, struck the area in 1811–12. The results were widespread soil liquefaction and a change in geography that produced &quot;sunken lands&quot;, which were sandy berms of silt and sediment disturbed by the earthquakes. Some tracts of land were sunk over and disappeared underneath newly formed lakes (such as Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee), or transformed from green forests to stagnant swamps.

In 1830, following continuing speculation and settlement in the area in the years after the earthquakes, two settlers, William Bard Edrington and John Price Edrington, negotiated the acquisition of Native American lands along the Mississippi River. By this point, the combination of abundant timber as an obvious economic asset and easy access to shippers and travelers along the river began driving growth in the region. In 1837, the settlement adopted the name &quot;Plum Point&quot;.

===Antebellum period, Civil War and Reconstruction===
The Plum Point community had developed into a successful waypoint on the Mississippi as well as a hub for the timber required to power the steamboats that had become common on America&#x27;s waterways. Settlers began to explore the uses for the fertile soils now ripe for row agriculture following clearing of the dense forests. It became apparent that the soil supported cotton extremely well, which was already a popular crop elsewhere in the South due to heavy European demand driven by the Industrial Revolution and resulting high market prices. Farmers from other cotton states began to relocate to Mississippi County and throughout the Arkansas Delta, bringing slaves, &quot;King Cotton&quot; culture and the plantation agriculture system with them. In 1853, the community had changed from mostly silviculture to agricultural, had a total of 250 residents, and officially incorporated as &quot;Osceola&quot;.

Osceola strongly supported secession in 1861, and raised a volunteer company called the Osceola Hornets to fight for the Confederacy. The unit was under command of Captain Charles Bowen within the 2nd Confederate Infantry. Osceola saw thousands of Union troops enter the area in 1862 in preparation to assault Fort Pillow and Memphis. On the river, the Battle of Plum Point Bend took place between the Confederate River Defense Fleet and the Union Mississippi River Squadron in 1862. Osceola itself was mostly subject to raids from both armies and guerrilla warfare that resulted in burning, pillaging and damage throughout the city.

Following the Civil War, race relations began to tighten between plantation owners who had lost the slave labor that fueled their successful plantations, poor whites who were suddenly in competition for work and social status with freedmen, and the former slaves who continued to face deprivation of their rights despite the war&#x27;s outcome. Whitecapping by the Ku Klux Klan and other groups promoted a lawless atmosphere in Mississippi County. Violent racial encounters were common in the county and throughout the Arkansas Delta. An extreme example from Mississippi County was nicknamed the Black Hawk War. The racial violence and lawlessness continued to escalate, eventually resulting in Governor Powell Clayton declaring Mississippi County and thirteen other counties under martial law from November 1868 until March 1869.

The city was incorporated a second time in 1872, with newspaper owner Leon Roussan being elected as the mayor.

===The New South===

Osceola is the county seat of Mississippi County, and is also the seat of one of two judicial districts. Blytheville was named a secondary judicial district in 1901.

Anchoring the town square is the 1912 neoclassical Mississippi County Courthouse, with a copper-roofed dome. The courthouse is bordered by the Hale Avenue Historic District and other structures on the National Historic Register of Historic Places. The Mississippi County Historical Center is located in a 1904 building that once housed a dry goods store.

Osceola is famous for its role in the development of blues music, and many famous blues musicians either came from Osceola or performed there. To celebrate this heritage, Main Street Osceola has been hosting the Osceola Heritage Festival since 1998.

==Geography==
Osceola is located in east-central Mississippi County. The city&#x27;s eastern border follows the levee that protects it from the Mississippi River. The Tennessee border is less than to the east of the levee, in a narrow channel of the Mississippi separated from the main river by Island Number 30. To the west the city limits extend as far as Interstate 55 and its Exit 48 (Arkansas Highway 140 / West Keiser Avenue). I-55 leads north to Blytheville and south to West Memphis. U.S. Route 61 is the main road through the center of Osceola, using Keiser Avenue and Walnut Street.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city of Osceola has a total area of , all land.

===Region===
The county is located in the Arkansas Delta, one of the six primary geographic regions of Arkansas. The Arkansas Delta is a subregion of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain, which is a flat area consisting of rich, fertile sediment deposits from the Mississippi River between Louisiana and Illinois.

===Geology===

Osceola is within the New Madrid Seismic Zone, a major seismic zone and a prolific source of intraplate earthquakes. The area experienced the highest magnitude earthquake in North America east of the Rocky Mountains in the 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes.

===Hydrology===

The eastern edge of Osceola is the Mississippi River, which is also the state border between Arkansas and Tennessee. The river has provided opportunity for the Osceola since it was founded as a waypoint for river travelers in 1833. Steamboats allowed Osceola to continue to leverage its position on the river as a shipping port for timber and cotton from the surrounding fields.

Although critical to the growth and development of Osceola, the river has also been a source of adversity for the community. The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the most destructive river flood in the history of the United States, and another flood in 1937 both damaged Osceola significantly, displacing hundreds of citizens and ruining crops.

===Climate===
Osceola has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;).

==Infrastructure==

The City of Osceola Public Works Department contains seven subdivisions responsible for providing essential city services to the citizens and businesses of Osceola. Directly under city administration are the Animal Shelter, Code Enforcement, Fire Department and Police Department. A municipally-owned entity named Osceola Municipal Light &amp; Power houses the Electric, Street and Sanitation, and Water &amp; Wastewater departments.

===Electric===
Osceola Municipal Light &amp; Power provides power to customers within Osceola, and some nearby customers beyond the city limits via a distribution system they own and operate. The power source is a mixture of city generation facilities and purchased power from Mississippi County Electric Cooperative, a member of Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation.

===Water/Wastewater===
Osceola&#x27;s source for drinking water is the Wilcox Aquifer, located beneath the city. Three sites throughout town pump raw water from this aquifer to the ground surface, where air is added to lower the iron content. Next, chlorine, lime and polymer are added to soften the water. The water is then clarified, filtered and held in ground storage tanks ( total capacity) before being pumped into a , elevated storage tank, which set the city&#x27;s static water pressure. The city owns and operates approximately of water mains, ranging in diameter from with an average static pressure of . Osceola experiences an average demand of per day. A wellhead protection ordinance has been in effect since 2002.

Wastewater is collected from customers and conveyed using gravity sewers, lift stations and force mains. The system has 21 lift stations to pump wastewater over rises in terrain where gravity flow is not economical. Wastewater ultimately reaches the Osceola Wastewater Treatment Facility (WWTF), which has a design capacity of per day. At the WWTF, influent wastewater is treated in faculative lagoons in accordance with the city&#x27;s NPDES permit administrated by the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ). Water is treated within the lagoons for two to four months before being discharged to the Mississippi River via a pumping station. An industrial pretreatment program has been in effect since 2004.

== Industry ==
Osceola is home to several industries that manufacture a variety of items. American Greetings, a privately owned American company which is the world&#x27;s largest greeting card producer, opened in Osceola in 1961 as the largest manufacturing facility under one roof in Arkansas. The plant occupies 2.6 million square feet or 60 acres and is the largest employer in Mississippi County.

<text>Wilson is a city in Mississippi County, Arkansas, United States. The community is located in the Arkansas Delta and is surrounded by fertile cropland historically used to produce cotton. Wilson started as a company town in 1886 by Robert E. Lee Wilson, who would build a cotton empire and run it from the city. The Wilson Company would become so successful that all of the town&#x27;s buildings were rebuilt in the Tudor Revival architectural style following Wilson&#x27;s son&#x27;s honeymoon to England in 1925. Wilson incorporated in 1959, becoming a town with public roads and municipal government. The extensive property holdings of the Lee Wilson and Company remained in the Wilson family until 2010. The community has seen a rapid decline in economic activity and population since the advent of mechanization on the farm, reducing the need for manual labor to produce cotton. The population was 766 at the 2020 census, down from 903 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The area was first known as Crowell&#x27;s Landing, but mostly washed away in the 1880s. Steamboat agent Dr. J.W. Rhodes purchased 37 acres in 1883 and founded a new landing on the Mississippi River he named Golden Lake. Soon after he was named postmaster. 

The city of Wilson was started about a mile and half north as a company town for Robert E. Lee Wilson&#x27;s nearby logging and sawmill operation founded in 1886. The village prospered when Wilson decided to use the cleared land for agriculture instead of selling it after logging. In 1900, a major archaeological find occurred near Wilson when James K. Hampson discovered the Island 35 Mastodon. All residents of Wilson except the postmaster and railroad employees had access to company doctors for $1.25 annually ($ in 2024 dollars), a rarity in the poverty-stricken Arkansas delta. The company also employed people to work in Wilson&#x27;s basic service industries, such as drycleaning and automobile repair, keeping the standard of living high.

In the early 1900&#x27;s, R.L. Wilson began construction on a railroad to connect the town with Golden Landing and his saw mill operations in the area. This line was bought out by the Jonesboro, Lake City and Eastern Railroad in 1912.
After Wilson&#x27;s son, Wilson Jr., and his wife returned from their England honeymoon enthralled with the Tudor style in 1925, all subsequent public buildings were built with Tudor architecture, including retrofits to all existing public structures. The town incorporated in 1959, selling the houses to the renters living in them and gaining access to tax income it was previously excluded from as a company entity. As technology advanced on the farm, fewer employees were needed and many moved from Wilson to seek other employment.

On January 27, 1921, the lynching of Henry Lowry happened near Wilson; some 500 people participated in the burning of a black sharecropper.

==Geography==
Wilson is in southern Mississippi County, in the Arkansas Delta region of the state. The area is dominated by the Mississippi River flood plains, trees and fields. Along and parallel to the Tennessee–Arkansas state line, the former course of the Mississippi River as it was before the 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes is still visible in the landscape more than 200 years after the events. The former riverbed has shrunk to small side arms of the Mississippi which, dependent on the water level and precipitation, are still partly connected to the river. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

The town is located at the intersection of U.S. Route 61 (US 61) and Arkansas Highway 14. The segment of US 61 through Wilson has been designated as part of the Great River Road, a tourist route to display the heritage of communities along the Mississippi River. Highway 61 leads north to Osceola, the Mississippi county seat, and southwest to Turrell.

==Economy==
Agriculture is the predominant source of income in the area surrounding Wilson, especially the cultivation of cotton. After the abolition of slavery, sharecropping was the primary means of income for low income families in the area. Mostly for the cultivation of cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines like the cotton picker have made manual cultivation obsolete over time as they took over the work from the hand laborers.

===Tourism===

The Hampson Museum State Park in downtown Wilson exhibits an archeological collection of early American aboriginal artifacts from the Nodena site 5 mi (8 km) east of the town. The museum documents the culture of a civilization which existed in a 15-acre (60,703 m2) palisaded village on a meander bend of the Mississippi River in the area around 1400–1650 CE. Cultivation of crops, hunting, social life, religion and politics of that ancient civilization are topics of the exhibition.

In 1964, the Nodena site was declared a National Historic Landmark, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places two years later.

== Education ==
Public education for elementary and secondary school students is available from the Wilson-based Rivercrest School District (formerly Southern Mississippi County School District), which leads to graduation from Rivercrest High School.

The Wilson school district merged into the South Mississippi district in 1968.

<doc id="107147" wikidata="Q79594" url="?curid=107147" title="Brinkley, Arkansas">
<text>Brinkley is the most populous city in Monroe County, Arkansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 2,700, down from 3,188 in 2010.

Located within the Arkansas Delta, Brinkley was founded as a railroad town in 1872. The city has historically been a transportation and agricultural center in the region, more recently developing a reputation for outdoors recreation and the ivory-billed woodpecker. Birding has become important to the city and region following the purported discovery of the ivory-billed woodpecker in 2004, a species thought to be extinct 60 years earlier.

Located halfway between Little Rock and Memphis, the city has used the slogan &quot;We&#x27;ll Meet You Half-Way&quot; in some of its advertising campaigns.

==History==
In 1852, a land grant for the construction of rail lines was given to the Little Rock and Memphis Railroad Company, led by its president Robert Campbell Brinkley. Born in North Carolina, Brinkley lived in Memphis, where he served a public career of &quot;noble deeds and generous conduct&quot; and for many years served as president of Planters Bank.

Between 1852 and 1869, the settlement was called &quot;Lick Skillet&quot;. When the day&#x27;s work was completed, the railroad construction crew, mostly all immigrants from neighboring towns, cooked their supper over an open fire and returned to their homes when the last &quot;skillet was licked&quot;.

The construction of the rail lines between Little Rock and Memphis brought the city of Brinkley into being. Brinkley is situated in the northern part of Monroe County, the halfway point between the two larger cities. It was laid out in the winter of 1869 on lands belonging to the railroad.

A petition request was granted to incorporate Brinkley on August 6, 1872, at which time the town had 50 qualified voters. The original charter was filed with the Arkansas Secretary of State on August 21, 1872. The Cotton Plant Railroad (later called the Batesville and Brinkley Railroad and the White and Black River Valley Railway) originated from the town in 1879, and the Texas and St. Louis Railway was built through Brinkley in 1883. The Brinkley, Helena and Indian Bay Railway connected to town in about 1889, the line later becoming the Arkansas Midland Railroad and subsequently the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway in 1910.

On March 8, 1909, much of the town was destroyed by a violent F4 tornado, which resulted in 49 deaths. Entire families were lost to the tornado, and approximately 800 buildings in the community were destroyed. The tornado was 2/3 of a mile wide.

Duck hunting is a major source of income for the city during the months of November, December and January. With many rice fields flooded for the winter, and being located on the Mississippi Flyway, ducks are very prevalent throughout the region. Men and women from around the United States come to Brinkley for guided hunts throughout the season.

==Geography==

===Tourism===

Brinkley is located east of the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge, where in February 2004 the ivory-billed woodpecker was purportedly rediscovered after having thought to be extinct for over 60 years. Brinkley has attempted to capitalize on its good fortune of being the largest city near the refuge and the rediscovery of the woodpecker.

In addition to the ivory-billed sightings, since July 2005 at least two confirmed reports of bald eagle nests have been found in the Monroe County area. Further, the swamps of the Cache River are believed to contain among the oldest cypress trees in the United States.

Brinkley opened a convention center in 1996 which can seat up to 600 people; in February 2006 the center hosted a conference commemorating the second anniversary of the ivory-billed woodpecker&#x27;s rediscovery.

<text>Clarendon is a city in, and the county seat of, Monroe County, Arkansas, United States. Located in the Arkansas Delta, the city&#x27;s position on the White River at the mouth of the Cache River has defined the community since first incorporating in 1859. Although the river has brought devastation and disaster to the city occasionally throughout history, it has also provided economic opportunities, transportation, recreation and tourism to the city.

Once home to a variety of industries, today Clarendon&#x27;s economy is largely based on agriculture. Similar to many Delta communities, the city&#x27;s population has been dwindling since mechanization on the farm reduced the number of agricultural-related jobs in the area. At the 2020 census, the population was 1,526, the lowest value recorded since 1890.

==History==

===Settlement through antebellum period===
The area around Clarendon was originally populated by various Native American groups. By 1799, French hunters and trappers had built cabins at the mouth of the Cache River. It was the point where the Military Road from Memphis, Tennessee, to Little Rock crossed the White River. The Military Road was begun in 1826 and completed in 1828. By that date, a ferry crossing and post office had been established in Clarendon, and the town served as the terminus for a stagecoach line to the west. The Military Road was used as the route for some groups of Native Americans being relocated from eastern states to Oklahoma during the forced relocations commonly known as the Trail of Tears; Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Cherokee groups are known to have traveled along it. 

The town also acquired railroad connections. In 1872 the town was added to the Arkansas Central Railway, later the Arkansas Midland Railroad, linking it to the Mississippi River port of Helena, Arkansas. Though it required construction of a 4-mile-long White River bridge and trestle, Clarendon was added to the line of the Texas and St. Louis Railway, a continuous system between Texas and Missouri, by mid-1883. The Texas and St. Louis Railway trackage became the St. Louis Southwestern Railway or “Cotton Belt” in 1891, and the Arkansas Midland trackage later became the part of the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway in 1910.

===Civil War and Reconstruction===
The city of Clarendon was officially incorporated in 1859. In 1864, the city was burned to the ground by Union forces in retaliation for the sinking of the tinclad Union gunboat &quot;USS Queen City&quot; by forces under the command of Confederate Brigadier General Joseph O. Shelby. The town&#x27;s charter was dissolved in 1884, and it was reincorporated in 1898.

===Gilded age through early 20th century===

In the early 1900s, Clarendon developed a number of industries, including lumber, staves and barrels, oars, and buttons made from the shells of the area&#x27;s plentiful freshwater mussels. The mussels also provided freshwater pearls, which were bought and sold at the Clarendon Pearl Market. The Moss Brothers Bat Company supplied baseball bats to a number of major league baseball players during this era.

Like most of eastern Arkansas, Clarendon was devastated by the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. The main levee at Clarendon held until the White River reached a height of , above normal flood stage; the flood eventually crested at . While no fatalities were reported, the town was inundated by water up to the second floor of many buildings, and the catastrophic inrush of water when the levee broke caused considerable damage to many buildings. The cleanup of mud and debris took many years.

===World War II onwards===
The area around Clarendon today is primarily agricultural; tourism related to the area&#x27;s hunting and fishing resources is the most common non-agricultural economic activity. The reported rediscovery of the ivory-billed woodpecker in 2004–2005 in the Cache River and White River National Wildlife Refuges has brought new attention to the area.

The 1931 bridge, listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and Historic American Engineering Record (HAER), has been subject to local restoration efforts as a bike and pedestrian path. The main span of the bridge was demolished using explosives on the morning of November 19, 2019.

Wastewater is collected and conveyed to the Clarendon Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) south of town. The facility uses a lagoon system, filters, and chlorination to produce treated effluent in accordance with the city&#x27;s NPDES permit administrated by the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ).

<text>Fargo is a town in Monroe County, Arkansas, United States. As of the 2020 United States census it had a population of 57, down from 98 in 2010.

==History==
Main lines and branches of railroads were being built across Arkansas in the late 1880s. By 1898, two of them—the St. Louis Southwestern Railway running roughly north–south, and the Missouri and North Arkansas Railroad (M&amp;NA) running roughly east–west—crossed. A post office with the name Fargo was established at the crossing, but it was not yet a town. In 1911, the two railways built a depot in Fargo.

At least 33 settlements formed along the railroad as the M&amp;NA was built, including Fargo, where Leroy Mahon owned the farmland at the railroad crossing.

===Development as a &quot;freedmen&#x27;s town&quot;===

Leroy Mahon platted the land and created a settlement for Black families. In doing so, he created a freedmen&#x27;s town.

Leroy (&quot;Lee&quot;) Washington Mahon was born into slavery as Leroy Stenhouse in 1861 in Greenville County, South Carolina. The surname Stenhouse was the same as their slaveowners. When freed, his parents and their children worked as sharecroppers. In 1888, Leroy and his brother Tom moved to Monroe County, Arkansas for better opportunities. In about 1900, Leroy changed his surname to Mahon, and in 1911 he platted the town on of his farmland and Black homeowners bought plots and built homes.

The first established church in Fargo was called First Baptist and Bethel Presbyterian.

In 1920, Floyd B. Brown established the Fargo Agricultural School, which brought students from across the state and had some financial supporters even outside Arkansas. The school focused on outreach and community service in Fargo, gravelling the mud roads, bringing electricity and telephone service to the town, and holding an annual farmers&#x27; conference that brought hundreds of farmers to the area to share information and knowledge.

<text>Prescott is a city in and the county seat of Nevada County, Arkansas, United States. The community had a population of 3,296 at the 2010 census. Prescott is part of the Hope Micropolitan Statistical Area.

Located 100 miles southwest of Little Rock, Prescott was developed on the Prairie D&#x27;Âne, named by French colonists before the United States acquired this area. The prairie consisted of approximately 25–30 square miles of rolling open land, surrounded by forest. The area had been a well-known crossroads prior to construction of the Cairo &amp; Fulton Railroad. To the west lies the city of Washington, to the east lies the city of Camden, while to the south lies the Red River, with Shreveport, Texarkana, and Dallas beyond.

As of 2014, Prescott and Nevada County had sixteen properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Elkin&#x27;s Ferry Battleground and the Prairie D&#x27;Ane Battlefield are further recognized as National Historic Landmarks within a National Historic Landmark District.

==History==
The city of Prescott was not platted until 1873 during Reconstruction. It was to be a station stop for the Cairo &amp; Fulton Railroad then under construction. The railroad was constructed parallel to the Southwest Trail through northern Nevada County. Prescott was incorporated on October 6, 1874.

The original town site consisted of 48 blocks, 24 on each side of the railroad. The streets were platted in a grid pattern from the railroad line. Streets running east–west use the railroad as a dividing line between their eastern and western halves, and streets running north–south use Main Street as a dividing line between their northern and southern halves.

Prescott grew quickly because the railroad provided a reliable way to transport local products to larger markets. The first post office opened in November 1873, and the first newspaper, &quot;The Banner&quot;, was established in 1875. The Nevada County seat was moved to Prescott in 1877, which contributed to the town&#x27;s commercial importance. It became a center of law and government in the county. By the late 1890s, Prescott had its own telephone system and water and light plant.

The timber industry became important to the region&#x27;s early economy when in 1890, James H. Bemis &amp; Benjamin Whitaker built the Ozan Lumber Company plant in Prescott. That same year, Dr. R. L. Powers began constructing the Prescott &amp; Northwestern Railroad. It transported lumber, peaches, cotton and other products. It also provided passenger service, connecting adjacent communities to the Missouri Pacific Railroad Depot in Prescott.

Historians have speculated on the naming of Prescott: whether it was named after William Hickling Prescott, of Salem, Massachusetts, who was a friend of Cairo &amp; Fulton Railroad officials Thomas Allen and Henry Marquand, or where it was named after the County Surveyor, W. H. Prescott.

==Geography==
Prescott is located on south-southwest section of Prairie D&#x27;Âne. The large open prairie was named by French colonists and is located in the Arkansas Timberlands region of the Ark-La-Tex.
