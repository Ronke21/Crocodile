== History ==

After the 1769 expedition of Gaspar de Portolá, a Spanish expedition led by Father Junípero Serra named the area Vallejo de Santa Ana (Valley of Saint Anne). On November 1, 1776, Mission San Juan Capistrano became the areas first permanent European settlement in Alta California, New Spain. In 1810, the Spanish Empire granted to Jose Antonio Yorba, which he named Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana. Yorba&#x27;s rancho included the lands where the cities of Olive, Orange, Villa Park, Santa Ana, Tustin, Costa Mesa and Newport Beach stand today.

After the Mexican-American War in 1848, Alta California became part of the United States in 1850 and American settlers arrived in this area.

Villa Park was known as &quot;Mountain View&quot; in the 1860s. The U.S. Post Office refused to allow the local post office to be so named as there was already a post office with that name in Santa Clara County, so the post office and hence the area came to be called Villa Park after a town in Illinois. It was then an agricultural area producing, in turn, grapes, walnuts, and apricots. Finally, citrus became the major crop for about 60 years.

Ranchers established the Serrano Water District in 1876, which still provides Villa Park&#x27;s water, and founded the Villa Park Orchards Association (still a business in Orange, although the packing house that was a local landmark was torn down in 1983).

In 2005, the Orange County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) shrunk Villa Park&#x27;s sphere of influence to zero due to its being landlocked by the city of Orange. Shortly after, LAFCO restored Villa Park&#x27;s sphere of influence after an outcry from local community leaders.

<text>Westminster is a city in western Orange County, California, United States. Westminster was founded in 1870 by Rev. Lemuel Webber as a Presbyterian temperance colony and was incorporated in 1957.

Westminster is bordered by the city of Seal Beach on the west, by Garden Grove on the north and east, and by Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley on the south. Santa Ana, the county seat of Orange County, is east of Westminster.

Westminster has one of the largest Vietnamese populations in the US. They settled largely in Little Saigon, and the city is known as the &quot;capital&quot; of overseas Vietnamese with 39,799 Vietnamese Americans, or 43.8% of the total population, as of the 2020 United States Census.

In the court case &quot;Mendez v. Westminster&quot; (1947), a Hispanic man sued the Westminster School District for forcing his daughter, Sylvia Mendez, to attend a school for Mexican children. They eventually won and thus began the process of desegregation. Sylvia Mendez was later awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama on February 15, 2011.

Westminster won the All-America City Award in 1996.

==History==
Westminster was founded in 1870 by Rev. Lemuel Webber as a Presbyterian temperance colony. The name is derived from the Westminster Assembly of 1643, which established the basic tenets of the Presbyterian faith. During the early years of its history, farmers refused to harvest grapes since they associated grapes with alcohol.

Westminster was incorporated in 1957, at which time it had 10,755 residents. Originally, the city was named &quot;Tri-City&quot; because it was to be the amalgamation of three cities: Westminster, Barber City, and Midway City. Midway City ultimately refused incorporation, leaving only Barber City to be absorbed into the newly incorporated Westminster. The former Barber City was located in the western portion of the current city of Westminster.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The San Diego Freeway and a short segment of the Garden Grove Freeway pass through Westminster.

Westminster is bordered by the city of Seal Beach on the west, by Garden Grove on the north and east, and by Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley on the south. Santa Ana, the county seat of Orange County, is east of Westminster, although a small portion of Garden Grove lies between the two cities. Westminster borders the unincorporated area of Midway City, except for a small portion where Midway City borders Huntington Beach on the south. The Little Saigon district of the town is mostly situated on Bolsa Avenue between Magnolia Street and Brookhurst Street.

<text>Yorba Linda is a suburban city in northeastern Orange County, California, United States, approximately southeast of Downtown Los Angeles. It is part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area, and had a population of 68,336 at the 2020 census.

Yorba Linda is known for its connection to Richard Nixon, the 37th president of the United States. His birthplace is a National Historic Landmark, and his presidential library and museum are also located in the city.

== History ==
===Etymology===
The name Yorba Linda is made up of two parts: Yorba, after Don Bernardo Yorba, a Californio ranchero who historically owned the area, and &quot;linda&quot;, Spanish for beautiful. The name was created in 1908 by the Janss Investment Company.

=== Indigenous ===
The area is the home of the Tongva, Luiseño, and Juaneño tribal nations, who were there &quot;as early as 4,000 years ago.&quot; The Tongva defined their world as Tovaangar, a nation which &quot;extended from Palos Verdes to San Bernardino, from Saddleback Mountain to the San Fernando Valley&quot; and included the entire territory of present-day Yorba Linda. Spanish colonization between 1769 and 1840 brought &quot;disease, invasive species, and livestock&quot; into the area, which &quot;upended the ecological balance of the region and forced the Tongva to resettle around three missions.&quot; The village of Hutuknga was located in the area of Yorba Linda.

=== Early years ===
In 1810, the Spanish crown granted José Antonio Yorba 63,414 acres of land, which &quot;spread across much of modern-day Orange County.&quot; In 1834, following Mexico&#x27;s independence from Spain, Yorba&#x27;s most successful son, Bernardo Yorba (after whom the city would later be named), was granted the Rancho Cañón de Santa Ana by Mexican governor José Figueroa. Most of this original land was retained after the Mexican–American War in 1848 by descendants of the Yorba family. A portion of the city&#x27;s land is still owned and developed by descendants of Samuel Kraemer, who acquired it through his marriage to Angelina Yorba, the great-granddaughter of Bernardo Yorba. The site of the Bernardo Yorba Hacienda, referred to as the Don Bernardo Yorba Ranch House Site, is listed as a California Historical Landmark.

Near that same site sits the second oldest private cemetery in the county, the historic Yorba Cemetery. The land was given to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles by Bernardo Yorba in 1858 since Orange County was not established out of Los Angeles County as a separate county until 1889. The cemetery closed in 1939 and was subsequently vandalized; however, in the 1960s, the Orange County Board of Supervisors took possession of the property to repair the damage, and tours are now available one day per month.

=== Agricultural era ===

A section of the land was sold in 1907 by the Yorba family to Fullerton businessman Jacob Stern, who used the land for barley fields and sheep grazing. Stern subsequently sold the tract to the Janss Investment Company, which first called the area Yorba Linda, and proceeded to subdivide the land and sell it for agriculture and manufacturing. In 1910, the agricultural aspect of that endeavor materialized, and the first of many lemon and orange groves were planted: at the time, the population was still less than 50. A year later, The Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company began serving Yorba Linda, and the first school was constructed.

In 1912, several things happened in Yorba Linda: it received its first post office; the Yorba Linda Citrus Association was founded; the Southern California Edison Company began providing electricity; and the first church was constructed. The area that would later become downtown was also connected to Los Angeles by the Pacific Electric Railway in 1912, primarily for citrus transport.

In 1913, Richard Nixon was born in Yorba Linda, the chamber of commerce was set up, a library opened as part of the school, and avocado trees were first planted. A year later, a separate district was established for the library system.

In 1915, the Susanna Bixby Bryant Ranch house was constructed. It is a museum that is open to the public.

In 1917, the first street was paved, Yorba Linda Boulevard. The &quot;Yorba Linda Star&quot; began publication also. It has since become an online section of the OC Register. A printed version of the Star is available at various city buildings free of charge and is delivered to every household in Yorba Linda each Thursday. Past articles are on microfilm at the Yorba Linda Public Library.

The population exceeded 300 for the first time prior to 1920. In 1929, the citrus association&#x27;s packing house burned down, as it was made of wood. It reopened the next year. During this period, the eastern two-thirds of Yorba Linda (east of the Yorba Linda Country Club) remained part of cattle and agricultural ranches controlled by pioneer families such as the Yorba, de los Reyes, Kraemer, Travis, Dominguez, Friend, and Bryant ranches.

From 1943 to 1958, &quot;approximately seventy thousand braceros were transported to Orange County,&quot; used by employers to service citrus crops. Braceros lived in temporary housing projects referred to as &quot;camps,&quot; which were policed by local deputies throughout the county. The townspeople of Yorba Linda &quot;refused to allow the housing of braceros in their city, forcing the nearby town of Placentia to board them within the segregated Mexican &quot;colonia&quot;.&quot;

=== Population growth ===

The small town had grown significantly by the 1960s, with more than 1,000 residents by the 1960 census. Three annexation attempts were made by adjoining cities: Brea in 1958 and Anaheim and Placentia in 1963. These experiences culminated in incorporation, which occurred in 1967.

The new city implemented a municipal general plan in 1972. By the 1980 census, the population was nearing 30,000. Within ten years it exceeded 50,000.

In 1990, the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum opened as a privately owned, public museum and research library with ceremonies that included a joint appearance by Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. The campus included the Birthplace of Richard Nixon. The facility would later join the presidential library system. In 1994, the community center opened.

With over 20,000 housing units in the city as of 2016, many residents now oppose further urban development and have organized to reduce traffic congestion. The Yorba Linda Preservation Foundation seeks to protect historical buildings in the city.

=== Post 2008 ===
In November 2008, eastern Yorba Linda suffered from fires that destroyed 113 homes and damaged 50 others. The destruction was due largely to erratic winds causing embers to fly up to half a mile away.

On February 3, 2019, at approximately 1:45 pm, a twin engine 1981 Cessna (N414RS) on route from Fullerton Municipal Airport to Nevada crashed from roughly 7,500 ft into a single family residence in the 19700 block of Crestknoll Drive near Glenknoll Elementary School. The pilot (75-year-old Antonio Pastini) and four individuals in the residence were killed.

In October of the heightened 2020 California wildfires, fires destroyed one home and damaged ten others in the Yorba Linda area. Initially a brush fire, the Blue Ridge Fire quickly spread to 13,964 acres before being doused on November 11, 2020.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of which is land and (2.67%), water.

It has two ZIP codes, 92886 and 92887, covering approximately the western and eastern portions of the city, respectively. A third, 92885, exists exclusively for PO Boxes. The city is served by area codes 657 and 714 in a geographical overlay situation, in which 714 numbers were running out, so that 657 numbers are now also being issued in the same area. Eleven-digit dialing is therefore now required for local calls.

It is bordered by Anaheim on the south, Placentia on the west and southwest, Brea on the northwest, Chino Hills State Park on the north, and Corona on the east.

Originally, the city pursued construction of an auto mall on the entire Savi Ranch site. The original plan was rejected by residents in favor of a combination of retail stores, restaurants, hotels, and office buildings

As a significant source of sales tax revenue to Yorba Linda and as one of the first anchor tenants (along with Best Buy), The Home Depot became a political talking point in its own right, due to the geography that divides Savi Ranch into two sections, the larger east side falling within Yorba Linda&#x27;s city limits, and the west side where Home Depot is situated falling within the adjacent city of Anaheim boundaries.

Also located in the Yorba Linda side of Savi Ranch is the headquarters of John Force Racing, housing operations &amp; hosting displays of legendary 16-time NHRA Funny Car Champion John Force, his team of drivers, and their cars.

<text>Auburn is a city in and the county seat of Placer County, California, United States. Its population was 13,776 during the 2020 census. Auburn is known for its California Gold Rush history and is registered as a California Historical Landmark.

Auburn is part of the Sacramento metropolitan area.

==History==
 
Archaeological finds place the southwestern border for the prehistoric Martis people in the Auburn area. The indigenous Nisenan, an offshoot of the Maidu, were the first to establish a permanent settlement in the Auburn area.

In the spring of 1848, a group of French gold miners arrived and camped in what would later be known as the Auburn Ravine. This group was on its way to the gold fields in Coloma, California, and it included Francois Gendron, Philibert Courteau, and Claude Chana. The young Chana discovered gold on May 16, 1848. After finding the gold deposits in the soil, the trio decided to stay for more prospecting and mining.

Placer mining in the Auburn area was very good, with the camp first becoming known as the North Fork Dry Diggings. This name was changed to the Woods Dry Diggings, after John S. Wood settled down, built a cabin, and started to mine in the ravine. The area soon developed into a mining camp, and it was officially named Auburn in August 1849, by miners from Auburn, New York. By 1850, the town&#x27;s population had grown to about 1,500 people, and in 1851, Auburn was chosen as the seat of Placer County. Gold mining operations moved up the ravine to the site of present-day Auburn. In 1865, the Central Pacific Railroad, the western leg of the First transcontinental railroad, reached Auburn, as it was being built east from Sacramento toward Ogden, Utah.

The restored Old Town has houses and retail buildings from the middle of the 19th century. The oldest fire station and the Post Office date from the Gold Rush years. Casual gold-mining accessories, as well as American Indian and Chinese artifacts, can also be viewed by visitors at the Placer County Museum.

<text>Colfax (formerly Alden Grove, Alder Grove, Illinoistown, and Upper Corral) is a city in Placer County, California, at the crossroads of Interstate 80 and State Route 174. The population was 1,963 at the 2010 census. The town is named in honor of U.S. Vice President Schuyler Colfax (1869–73), a bronze statue of whom stands at Railroad Street and Grass Valley Street. (This is one of two known statues of Schuyler Colfax in the United States, the other located in Indianapolis, Indiana.)

Some of the town&#x27;s notable features include the newly restored Southern Pacific Railroad colonnade-style depot (which houses the Colfax Museum and Chamber of Commerce) built in 1905, the downtown shops on Main Street, and Colfax High School, which serves a large surrounding area.

==History==
Originally inhabited by the Maidu and Miwok Native Americans, by the mid-19th century the city site was known as &quot;Alder Grove&quot;; however, as development increased, the city became known as &quot;Illinoistown&quot;, a supply hub for gold mining camps. In April 1852, the Reelfoot Williams Gang robbed a Nevada City stagecoach of $7,000 in gold bullion near Illinoistown. This was the first stagecoach robbery in the gold country.

Later it was renamed Colfax after then Speaker of the House (and later Vice President) Schuyler Colfax who visited the town in 1865 while inspecting progress of construction of the Central Pacific Railroad, the western portion of the first transcontinental railroad. The city was the southern terminus of the Nevada County Narrow Gauge Railroad from 1876 until the railroad&#x27;s removal in 1942. Historic U.S. Route 40 also runs through the city as well as the more modern Interstate 80. The city is mentioned in Jules Verne’s book, &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;.

In July 2015 the Lowell Fire burned thousands of acres nearby, forcing evacuation in Nevada County.

In March 2020, the COVID-19 Pandemic caused a state wide shelter in place order to be issued. This resulted in the long term closure of many local businesses despite the direct opposition from local officials. 

On August 4, 2021, the River Fire started in the Bear River Campground, forcing thousands of residents on both the Placer and Nevada county sides of the river to evacuate. The fire was contained nine days later after burning over and dozens of homes. Acting Mayor Trinity Burruss led the city during the emergency response.

In December 2021, the city was placed under a state of emergency due to severe snow storms. More than 575,000 metered electric customers in Northern California were without power at some point during the storm, with about 141,000 still without power one month after the first major outage. The City was again reliant on the leadership of the Mayor to get supplies and critical support to residents left without a safe heat source.

==Geography==
Colfax is located at (39.097260, −120.954017). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

The principal geologic structures present are granitic and metamorphic rock formations. Located approximately west of Colfax is a branch of the Melones Fault, running in north to south direction. The fault runs through the old grammar school baseball field so they closed the school. (Earth Metrics, 1989) Another branch of the same fault is located about to the east, also aligned in a north–south orientation. No movement has been recorded by the U.S. Geological Survey, and the faults are considered inactive. Bunch Creek is an active water source flowing south to eventually reach a confluence with the North Fork of the American River.

Colfax sits a few miles outside the Tahoe National Forest as I-80 begins its climb into the Sierras. Because of its location it is considered at high risk of wildfire.

In 1916 Lora Josephine Knight bought the point. The land was originally part of an area called Chinquapin by the Washoe Indians. Robert Dollar purchased many properties such as the 1,436 acres in Rossmoor, California and in 1927 he purchased the area that had been called &quot;Old Lousy&quot;, &quot;the lousy point&quot;, and Observatory Point, from Lora Knight.

At the junction of these trails, the Forest House hotel and trading post was built. The height of mining activity in Foresthill began in 1853 after a winter landslide at the head of Jenny Lind Canyon exposed numerous nuggets of gold. The Jenny Lind mine produced about $2,500 of gold a day for a while, up to a total output over $1 million by 1880. The combined production of all the mines in the Forest Hill area was estimated at $10 million by 1868 with gold selling for $16 an ounce.

By 1857, this area had become an important center for trade among the many gold camps on the divide. In 1862, the Hardy-Kennedy building was erected - the first fireproof store in Foresthill. This building, now known as the Langstaff building, is still being used by the merchants of Foresthill.

==Historic fire lookout and scenic overlook==
The historic Stateline fire lookout and Crystal Bay scenic overlook are in Kings Beach on the hill above downtown, close to the California–Nevada state line, accessible by an easy hiking trail from Crystal Bay, Nevada.
==Beaver controversy==
In November, 2009, historically endemic California Golden beavers were caught in snares underwater and exterminated in Griff Creek, a stream in Kings Beach, when the Placer County Department of Public Works ordered their removal for fear that the beaver would cause flooding. Although beavers are an invasive species to the area, recent studies of two other Lake Tahoe tributaries, Taylor Creek and Ward Creek, showed that beaver dam removal decreased wetland habitat, increased stream flow, and increased total phosphorus pollutants entering Lake Tahoe – all factors that negatively impact the clarity of the lake&#x27;s water (United States Geological Survey 2002). Beavers develop wetland areas which trap sediments and improve water quality. Flow devices such as &quot;Beaver Deceivers&quot; are often used to control water heights in beaver ponds instead of killing beavers, as the latter is typically only a temporary remedy, for beavers recolonize prime habitat quickly. In fact, in October 2010 Placer County officials again exterminated beavers at King&#x27;s Beach only to have schoolchildren protest and suggest more contemporary management solutions. According to Placer County officials there were four beavers who built three dams on Griff Creek, and they were killed by sharpshooters licensed by the county in a night operation. The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency stated that &quot;removing beavers is not uncommon at Lake Tahoe&quot; but &quot;the county could have &#x27;easily&#x27; removed the beaver dam in a more conscientious manner, thus preventing sediment naturally filtered by the dam from reaching Lake Tahoe.&quot; Cheryl Millham, executive director of Lake Tahoe Wildlife Care, argued that the culverts on Griff Creek could easily be protected from damming with fencing and that &quot;municipalities all over the United States have learned to peacefully co-exist with these animals.&quot; Depredation is likely a temporary solution as the county has had to kill beaver families two years in a row and Peter Kraatz, deputy director of the Placer County Department of Public Works, conceded that the area is &quot;perfect habitat for beavers&quot;.

The CCRR was planned as a rail link between the cities of Marysville and Sacramento via a connection to the Sacramento Valley Railroad in Folsom. Grading from Folsom to Marysville commenced in 1858 and was completed up to Grider&#x27;s Ranch (Roseville) by 1859.

At Auburn Ravine, where the line makes an elbow and turns northward toward Marysville, a new railway town Lincoln was located by Judah with town lots on sale from Wilson. At an auction in Sacramento on November 23, 1859, over $4,000 was raised from the sales of lots in Lincoln, ranging from $20 to $400 for each lot. With the grading on the first division of the road from Folsom completed to Lincoln, track laying began at Folsom on December 30, 1859. With the help of the Chinese laborers, the company was able to complete the railroad to Lincoln on October 14, 1861. The completion of the railroad &quot;changed the appearance of the locality, and breathed into the town the breath of life&quot;, birthing possibly the first platted railroad town in California.

At this point, due to a lack of funds, further construction on the California Central was temporarily halted and Lincoln experienced a small-scale boom as the northern terminus of this new railroad. Within a few years, however, more investors were found and the line was extended to Wheatland, in Yuba County, bringing an end to this early stage of Lincoln&#x27;s development.

When most of its population and business moved on with the railroad, the town settled into a lull until the early 1870s, when rich clay deposits of the Ione Formation were discovered nearby. This led to the establishment of Gladding, McBean &amp; Co., the pottery for which Lincoln is now famous, ushering in a new era of prosperity and growth.

Lincoln remained a sleepy town until the mid-1990s, when the suburbs of Sacramento started expanding beyond nearby Roseville. The city is now experiencing a new period of growth. 2010 census, the population was 42,819, for a growth rate of 282 percent since 2000, making Lincoln the fastest-growing city in the United States over that decade.

In June 2003 the first casino in the greater Sacramento Metropolitan Area, the Thunder Valley Casino Resort, opened in Lincoln.

In 2006, Lincoln was named an All-America City by the National Civic League. It was the only California city to be named an All-America City that year and only one of the cities to receive the prestigious award.

<text>Loomis (formerly Pine, Pino, Smithville, and Placer) is an incorporated town in Placer County, California, United States. It is part of the Sacramento–Arden-Arcade–Roseville Metropolitan Statistical Area. The town&#x27;s population was reported as 6,836 in the 2020 census. It shares borders with the city of Rocklin and the Census-Designated Places Penryn and Granite Bay.

==History==
The Placer post office opened on the site in 1861, changed its name to Smithville in 1862, then changed it to Pino in 1869, and in 1890 the Southern Pacific Railroad finally decided on Loomis. The railroad and Post Office found that Pino was confused with the town of Reno, hence the name change to Loomis. The name Smithville honors L.G. Smith, who was one of the town&#x27;s most prominent leaders.

Loomis takes its name from one of the town&#x27;s pioneers, James Loomis. At one time, James Loomis was the whole town—saloon keeper, railroad agent, express agent, and postmaster.
In the early part of the 20th century, Loomis was the second largest fruit-shipping station in Placer County, Newcastle California, just east of Loomis, was considered the largest.

Loomis remained part of unincorporated Placer County until December 17, 1984, when the Town of Loomis officially incorporated. The Town was in danger of being annexed by its neighbor Rocklin and the residents voted to incorporate to preserve local control, partly on the issue of preserving the &quot;small town&quot; character and historic structures such as the High Hand and Blue Goose fruit packing sheds which sit between Taylor Road (a segment of historic Highway 40) and the Union Pacific Railroad tracks.

<text>Rocklin is a city in Placer County, California, United States, about from Sacramento, and about northeast of Roseville in the Sacramento metropolitan area. Besides Roseville, it shares borders with Granite Bay, Loomis and Lincoln. As of the 2020 census, Rocklin&#x27;s population was 71,601.

==History==
Before the California Gold Rush, the Nisenan Maidu occupied both permanent villages and temporary summer shelters along the rivers and streams that miners sifted, sluiced, dredged and dammed to remove the gold. Explorer Jedediah Smith and a large party of American fur trappers crossed the Sacramento Valley in April 1827. The group saw many Maidu villages along the river banks. Deprived of traditional foodstuffs, homesites and hunting grounds by the emigrants, the Nisenan were among the earliest California Indian tribes to disappear.

During the 1850s, miners sluiced streams and rivers, including Secret Ravine, which runs through Rocklin. The piles of dredger tailings are still obvious today, between Roseville and Loomis southeast of Interstate 80. Secret Ravine, at the area now at the intersection of Ruhkala Road and Pacific Street, was later mined for granite, some of which was used as the base course of the California Capitol Building; the earliest recorded use of the rock was for Fort Mason at San Francisco in 1855. The granite was hauled out by oxcarts before the arrival of the railroad many years later.

In 1860, the U.S. Census counted 440 residents in the area of Secret Ravine, of whom about 16% had been born in Ireland and the majority of whom worked as miners. The area was referred to as Secret Ravine or the &quot;granite quarries at the end of the tracks&quot; as late as 1864.

Rocklin&#x27;s history is closely tied to the transcontinental railroad. In 1862, the Pacific Railroad Act granted the Central Pacific Railroad land near Secret Ravine. In 1864, the Central Pacific Railroad completed an extension of its track southwest from Newcastle to Secret Ravine. It named the area Rocklin after its granite quarry and used the site as a refueling and water stop. The Central Pacific built a roundhouse in 1867. The transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, significantly increasing railroad traffic through the town. According to the 1870 census, Rocklin had grown to 542 residents, and the majority of Irish immigrants had forgone mining and were working for the railroad. In 1908, the Central Pacific moved its facility from Rocklin to Roseville, where more land was available for expansion. The Roseville site has remained in continuous use since. As of August 2014, it is the largest rail facility near the U.S. West Coast.

In 1869, a group of laid-off Chinese railroad workers moved to Secret Ravine to mine and raise vegetables which they sold locally. The Chinese community was violently driven out in September 1876 after a group of Chinese was accused of murdering three people near Rocklin. The area was still known as China Gardens as of 1974.

The Rocklin post office opened in 1868. Finnish immigrants settled in Rocklin starting in the 1870s, and Spanish settlers arriving by way of Hawaii settled in Rocklin in the early 20th century. The town incorporated in 1893.

<doc id="107853" wikidata="Q90629" url="?curid=107853" title="Carl Koch (director)">
<text>Carl Koch or Karl Koch (30 July 1892 in Nümbrecht, Germany – 1 December 1963 in Barnet, England) was a German art historian, film director and writer with many secondary credits including collaborations with his wife Lotte Reiniger, the animator of &quot;The Adventures of Prince Achmed&quot; (1926). In these collaborations, Koch often managed the camera work, which was mounted above Reiniger&#x27;s animation table.

Koch was an art historian, and before he met Reiniger, he made films for museums about art history and other educational matters. 

Other than his work with Reiniger, Koch is perhaps best known as assistant to Jean Renoir, who helped get Koch and Reiniger exit visas from Germany in 1936. Koch and Renoir, during the filming of &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; (in which Koch has an uncredited role), discovered that Koch&#x27;s artillery unit had actually fired on Renoir&#x27;s airplane during World War I. 

In 1939, Koch and Renoir began an adaptation of &quot;Tosca&quot; at Mussolini&#x27;s invitation. The French government urged Renoir to take the project as a way to keep Italy on their side as the war escalated, but Renoir had to abandon this project when Italy entered the war against France. Koch completed the film as &quot;Carlo Koch&quot;, with Luchino Visconti as his assistant.

After the war, in 1949, Koch moved with his wife to England where they settled in an artists&#x27; community called the Abbey Arts Centre in New Barnet. Together, they made 13 silhouette films for television and many others for various other producers in these later years.

<doc id="107854" wikidata="Q491340" url="?curid=107854" title="Roseville, California">
<text>Roseville is the most populous city in Placer County, California, located within the Sacramento metropolitan area. As of 2019, the US Census Bureau estimated the city&#x27;s population to be 141,500, making it the third-largest city in the Sacramento area. Interstate 80 runs through Roseville and State Route 65 runs through part of the northern edge of the city.

Historically associated with the railroad, the city underwent significant urban renewal in the 1980s and 1990s. Today it has become a major commercial hub, attracting regular shoppers and visitors from a large swath of rural southeastern Sacramento Valley and the Sierra Nevada foothills. In recent years, it has seen significant population growth and new single-family home developments, becoming a “boomburb” or edge city of Sacramento.

==History==
The Nisenan lived in the land that became Roseville for over 2000 years before being forcibly removed by disease, miners and settlers. The settlement developed around a stage coach station called Griders. According to the Roseville Historical Society, in 1864 the Central Pacific Railroad tracks were constructed northeastward from Sacramento as part of the transcontinental railroad. The point where the tracks met the California Central Railroad line was named &quot;Junction&quot;. Junction eventually became known as Roseville.

In 1909, three years after the Southern Pacific Railroad moved its facilities from Rocklin to Roseville, the town became an incorporated city. What followed was a period of expansion, with businesses building more than 100 structures, including what was the largest ice manufacturing plant in the world (the Pacific Fruit Express building) in 1913.

The city was a railroad town for decades. By 1929, the railroad employed up to 1,225 people out of a total population of 6,425. With the onset of World War II, the rail yards became busier than ever.

The post-war building boom brought continued prosperity. But the nature of the city changed dramatically in the 1950s.

During this decade, the railroad continued to expand and upgrade, converting its steam engine fleet to all diesel engines. But competition arose in new sectors: the postwar development of the national Interstate Highway System and the airline industry adversely affected the railroads&#x27; passenger and freight traffic. Trucking carried increasing amount of freight on highways. Industry restructuring took place and jobs were lost as railroads dropped passenger routes and consolidated operations.

Although the railroad has continued as a major employer in Roseville, the city&#x27;s expansion has been based on the emergence of other employment sectors.

Construction in 1950 of the Washington Boulevard (then called Seawell) railroad underpass dramatically affected downtown. It improved the ability of people to travel from one side of the tracks to the other, but it reduced traffic through the Roseville business district north of the tracks. Those businesses lost customers.

The completion of Interstate 80 in 1956 stimulated new businesses, with a population shift, from downtown to what would become known as East Roseville. The old downtown lost more businesses and slid into a gradual decline.

The Southern Pacific (now Union Pacific) yard was the site of the 1973 Roseville Yard Disaster. A major explosion and fire took place.

The city saw steady population growth throughout the ensuing decades, as shopping centers, major retailers, and homes were constructed, mostly outside the historic downtown. The growth rate was modest until 1985. Between 1929, when the population was 6,425 people, and 1985, the population grew by 22,563 people.

In 1985 the population stood at 28,988 people. Five years later it was 44,685 people, and by 2000 it was 74,234 people. Some of this growth was fueled by the arrival of major technology employers, such as Hewlett Packard (in 1979) and NEC (in 1983), in the city The population as of 2014 was 126,956 people.

===Revitalization===
In 1988, the city embarked on a multi-million dollar plan to redevelop approximately of land in the downtown core, and revitalize historic areas that had been in decline. Projects included the Vernon Streetscape Project, Atlantic Street Beautification, Civic Plaza Complex, Downtown Vernon Street and Historic Old Town, Historic Old Town Streetscape project, Riverside Avenue Streetscape project, Oak Street Improvement Project, and Washington Boulevard pedestrian underpass. A new parking garage opened in 2007, the Roseville Arts! Blueline Gallery opened in 2008, and a new Civic Center opened in 2013. The Vernon Street Town Square now features a small raised stage, a water spray for children, and a venue for community events.

===Incidents===
On April 28, 1973, a shipment of munitions bound for the Vietnam War exploded in Roseville&#x27;s rail yard creating a massive disaster.

In 1995, a Roseville police officer shot and killed another officer, Mark A. White, during an attack at the city&#x27;s police station. White (in plain clothes) drew his weapon against the assailant, but another officer mistakenly believed White was also an assailant and shot and killed him.

On October 21, 2010, a young man set fires inside the Westfield Galleria at Roseville resulting in major damage to the mall. It reopened the next year after renovations.

==Geography==

According to the Roseville Civic Center, the city has a total area of , of which is land. 0.002 square miles, or , is water. Several streams flow through Roseville, including Dry Creek, Linda Creek, Secret Ravine and Cirby Creek.

===Climate===
Roseville has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate that is characterized by cool, wet, usually snowless winters and hot, dry summers (Köppen &quot;Csa&quot;). The climate is similar to nearby Sacramento, the minor differences reflecting Roseville&#x27;s more inland position, resulting in less of the moderating influence of the ocean. As a result, winters are slightly cooler and summers are slightly hotter than Sacramento. Some marine influence does reach Roseville, so temperatures often are still more moderate than other inland parts of the Central Valley by up to .

The wet season is generally October through April. Because Roseville is east of Sacramento and at a higher elevation, it receives slightly more rainfall. The dry season lasts from June to October; similar to other Central Valley cities, temperatures can be extremely hot in the summer (routinely peaking above on the hottest days), unusual for a non-desert climate at mid-latitude. For any given year, summers can be consistently hot or mild depending on where the position of the North Pacific High settles around the end of June. Extremely hot years with July highs typically around are averaged out against milder summers that reach around .

Average daily high temperatures range from in January to in July. Daily low temperatures range from in winter to in summer.

On March 26, 2014, an EF0 tornado touched down in Roseville.

The primary industries in Chester are lumber production and tourism. Collins Pine (a division of The Collins Companies) has been in operation since the 1940s under a &quot;sustained yield&quot; management plan using selective harvesting. The company&#x27;s forest management practices have been certified as FSC sustainable by Scientific Certification Systems, which designated it a &quot;state-of-the-art well-managed forest.&quot; Collins no longer maintains the distinction of Chester&#x27;s dominant employer, though it remains the single business with the most employees. 

Other logging companies operating in the area are Roseburg Forest Products, and Sierra Pacific Industries. Clear cutting is performed in the area.

Lake Almanor has developed as a vacation/tourist destination and Chester serves as the retail center for the area. All of the Almanor basin&#x27;s four gas stations are located in Chester, as well as the Almanor basin&#x27;s only full-sized grocery store.

==History==

In 1821 Mary A Zubea was born. Four years later Frank Joseph Stampfli was born. When these two became adults they married. Frank Joseph Stampfli was born in Switzerland and immigrated to the United States. He then registered to pioneer out West where the Stampfli family settled in what is known today as Crescent Mills, CA and Indian Valley.

In 1867 Mary A Stampfli died and was buried on the Stampfli Ranch creating the family cemetery. A tall headstone marked Mary A. Stampfli 1821-1867 was placed above her grave. Lewis Stampfli followed in 1869 and Frank joined his wife in the family cemetery in 1892.

The local Native Americans of the Maui do and the Stampfli family had made relationships. Relationships between the Maui do and the Stampfli&#x27;s included local organizations such as the Indian Mission and marriage. Stampfli&#x27;s also married with the Peck family.

In 1915 Albert Riehl came to Plumas County and settled in Indian Valley. After meeting Vivian Stampfli they were married and took up residence in Crescent Mills. Albert went on to own the local slaughter house on the North end of town and a butcher shop 4 doors south of the current Gigis Market.
The second generation of Stampfli&#x27;s and Peck&#x27;s continued to branch out with other families that had settled within the area as well. In the early 1930s Pearl Peck moved away from the Stampfli Ranch and moved to San Francisco where she met and married David &quot;Bud&quot; Strong, an owner of a large nursery garden. They had two boys, David Strong Jr. and younger brother Deryl Glen Strong. Within a year after Deryl was born Pearl became home sick and asked her family to move back to Crescent Mills where Bud Strong Purchased the Stampfli Ranch.

The Stampfli Ranch covered the west side of Main Street up the mountainside then out to the east into a large flat valley named Indian Valley. The corner of Stampfli Lane and Main Street marks the middle of the Ranch.

Crescent Mills post office opened in 1870.

<text>Graeagle is a town and census-designated place in eastern Plumas County, California, United States, located along the Middle Fork Feather River in the Northern Sierra Nevada. The population was 737 as of 2010.

==History==

The town was founded in 1916 as a lumber town. A post office was established in 1919 with the moniker of Davies Mill. When the mill changed ownership in the 1920s, a naming contest was held. Belle Byrne contracted the name of nearby Gray Eagle Creek to Graeagle, winning the contest and its $5 prize.

The name of the creek may have had some connection with Edward D Baker, the &quot;Gray Eagle of Republicanism,&quot; who was in the mining region in 1856 while stumping the state for Frémont.

Graeagle Lumber Company was owned by the California Fruit Exchange which employed hundreds in logging, lumber production and the manufacturing of box shook (boxes for picking and shipping fruit and vegetables) from the 1920s to the 1950s. Modernization closed the mill in 1956 and the box factory in 1957. The town was acquired by the West family in 1959.

<text>Greenville () is an unincorporated community in Plumas County, California, United States, on the north-west side of Indian Valley. Most of the buildings were destroyed by the Dixie Fire in August 2021. The population was 1,129 at the 2010 census, down from 1,160 at the 2000 census. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Greenville as a census-designated place (CDP). According to the Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land.

==History==
The Maidu people had been living in the valley area around present-day Greenville for centuries when English-speaking settlers arrived in the 1850s during the Gold Rush. Among the earliest structures built in the community was a boarding house operated by Mr. and Mrs. Green. The community was named for Green, who was killed in the collapse of the first Round Valley Dam. When Henry C. Bidwell arrived in 1862 and opened a trading post, several business owners moved down from Round Valley to Greenville. Since its establishment, the main industries of Greenville were mining and logging, however, by the mid 1900s, mining had declined and logging and ranching became the main industries in Greenville. In the late 1800s, the Maidu tribe were granted over 200 acres of land by the US government where a boarding school was built which burned down in the 1920s. The land was later converted into a Rancheria.

Cheney Lumber Company built a wood mill near Greenville.

===Fires===
A fire destroyed many buildings in 1881; they were quickly rebuilt. Greenville&#x27;s population in 1882 was 500.

On August 4, 2021, about 75 percent of Greenville&#x27;s buildings were destroyed by the Dixie Fire, the largest single (i.e. non-complex) wildfire in the state&#x27;s history, and the second-largest overall (after the August Complex fire of 2020). Fire officials stated that the library, fire department, and most downtown homes were burned. The Los Angeles Times estimated that about $1 billion, through government aid, insurance payouts, lawsuits against Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, corporate investment and philanthropic donations, has been promised, paid or will be forced to pay for the damage and rebuilding of Greenville.

It is stated that nobody died in the fire. The single casualty from the incident was a firefighter who died from complications with COVID-19.

<text>Route 52 is a state highway in the southern part of the U.S. state of New Jersey. The highway runs from 9th Street in Ocean City, Cape May County north to U.S. Route 9 (US 9, New Road) in Somers Point, Atlantic County. It is composed mostly of a series of four-lane divided bridges over Great Egg Harbor Bay from Ocean City to Somers Point known as the Howard S. Stainton Memorial Causeway, also known as the Ninth Street Bridge. The remainder of the route is a surface road called MacArthur Boulevard that runs from the causeway to US 9. This section of the route formerly included the Somers Point Circle, now a traffic light, where Route 52 intersects County Route 559 (CR 559) and CR 585.

Route 52 was originally designated on June 1, 1937 to run from the Somers Point Circle northwest to Mays Landing. This routing never came about and in 1953, Route 52 was designated onto its current alignment. CR 585 ran concurrent with the route south of the Somers Point Circle until 1971, when it was truncated to end at the Somers Point Circle. The circle was removed in 2010 as part of the bridge reconstruction. In 2006, construction began on the replacement of the Route 52 causeway that was built in the 1930s over the Great Egg Harbor Bay, beginning with guardrail repairs that reduced traffic to two lanes. In 2008, the northbound lanes of the causeway were opened to traffic. Construction on the southbound lanes was completed in late 2009. The entire project was completed in 2012, including other improvements such as the construction of fishing piers, boat ramps, bike paths, walking trails, gateways, and a new Ocean City Visitor Center. In addition, improvements were made to MacArthur Boulevard that included the addition of a center left-turn lane and the replacement of the Somers Point Circle with a traffic light.

== Route description ==

Route 52 begins along 9th Street in the Jersey Shore city of Ocean City, Cape May County, approximately south of Palen Avenue. Past the southern terminus of Route 52, 9th Street heads southeast and terminates at the Ocean City Boardwalk along the Atlantic Ocean. From the beginning of state maintenance, the route continues to the northwest as a four-lane divided highway. Immediately after beginning, Route 52 becomes the Howard S. Stainton Memorial Causeway, also known as the Ninth Street Bridge, which crosses over Great Egg Harbor Bay on a high-level bridge and then the longer Rainbow Harbor Channel. In between these two channels is an island where the Roy Gillian Welcome Center is located, with access from the southbound lanes. After crossing the Rainbow Harbor Channel, the road runs along another island, with a fishing pier adjacent to the southbound lanes, before crossing over the Great Egg Harbor Thoroughfare (part of the Intracoastal Waterway) and then a ship channel on another high-level bridge, where the route enters Somers Point in Atlantic County.
After the ship channel, Route 52 crosses onto the mainland and intersects with CR 559 (Mays Landing Road) and CR 585 (Shore Road), formerly at the Somers Point traffic circle. In October 2010, the circle was eliminated and replaced by a traffic light. Beyond the former Somers Point Circle, Route 52 becomes a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane known as MacArthur Boulevard that heads north through commercial areas, soon narrowing to three lanes. The road curves northwest as a two-lane divided highway and enters residential areas. Route 52 comes to an end at an intersection with US 9 (New Road). The road continues northwest as West Laurel Drive, which heads through a residential neighborhood to a partial interchange with the Garden State Parkway, with access to the northbound parkway and access from the southbound parkway.

== History ==
Prior to 1914, access to the island city of Ocean City was only available by horse and buggy, ferry, or railroad. With the growing usage of the automobile, plans for a causeway to support automotive traffic were announced in 1912. The causeway opened on April 11, 1914 as the Somers Point Boulevard Bridge, connecting 9th Street in the northern part of Ocean City with the mainland town of Somers Point via a set of four bridges. The causeway was later replaced in 1933, with a new set of bridges that were four lanes wide without shoulders.

Route 52 was designated on June 1, 1937, to run from the Somers Point Circle northwest to Route 48 (now US 40) and Route 50 in Mays Landing. However, Route 52 was never built to run to Mays Landing. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 52 was designated to run from the Ocean City side of the causeway, north to US 9 in Somers Point.

With the creation of the 500-series county routes in New Jersey in 1952, CR 585 was designated to run along Route 52 between the southern terminus and the Somers Point Circle as part of its route between Route 109 in Lower Township and US 30 and Route 157 in Absecon.

Eventually, the southern terminus of CR 585 was truncated to the Somers Point Circle.

In 1983, the causeway was officially named the Howard S. Stainton Memorial Causeway, after the Ocean City entrepreneur and philanthropist, who died in 1979.

The causeway underwent a minor renovation in 1988. This saw the operator room expanded, equipment replaced, and controls modernized.

On January 16, 2006, the New Jersey Department of Transportation reduced traffic on the bridges from four lanes to two lanes to limit the weight on the old structures. The highway was reopened to four lanes of traffic after guardrail repairs were made on May 17, 2006, with a new speed limit of .
Between 2006 and 2012, a new $400 million causeway was built to replace the 1933 causeway over the Great Egg Harbor Bay. The original causeway was in need of replacement due to deteriorating conditions of the bridges, increasing automobile and marine traffic on the Great Egg Harbor Bay, flooding from storms, and a high accident rate due to narrow lanes and a lack of shoulders. The causeway also contained two drawbridges, which led to traffic jams during the summer months. After years of delays, construction began on the new bridge in September 2006. Crews began the project by clearing a staging area on Garrets Island near the Ocean City side. The northbound bridge was completed in April 2008 and the southbound bridge was completed in April 2009. During the bridge construction, excavated sand was removed from the bay and deposited onto Malibu Beach Wildlife Management Area, as part of environmental mitigation. In May 2012, construction of the causeway was completed, with all four lanes opened to traffic.

In addition to the new causeway, the project also called for the construction of fishing piers, boat ramps, bike paths, walking trails, and gateways at each end of the causeway, including a new visitor center with a scenic overlook on the Ocean City side. Also, other improvements were made to the MacArthur Boulevard portion of Route 52 including the addition of a center left-turn lane and the replacement of the Somers Point Circle with a traffic light, which was eliminated in October 2010. As a result of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 signed into law by President Barack Obama on February 17, 2009, $70 million, or about 8 percent of the money allocated to New Jersey in the bill, went to the construction of the second half of the Route 52 causeway project.

From 2012 to 2014, annual average daily traffic (AADT) on the causeway went from 18,584 to 22,116, an increase of 19 percent. The latest AADT of the MacArthur Boulevard section, from 2012, is 11,540.

On July 19, 2021, a pilot made an emergency landing on the bridge after encountering engine problems shortly after takeoff; the plane was undamaged, and traffic was briefly halted.

==History==
At the time of statehood in 1850, La Porte was located in Yuba County, one of California&#x27;s 27 original counties.

In 1852, Sierra County was created from part of Yuba County. After that time, La Porte was located in Sierra County.

In 1854, Plumas County was created from part of Butte County. In 1866, a further realignment placed La Porte in Plumas County, where it has remained ever since.

La Porte was named Rabbit Creek until 1857. Gold was found in Rabbit Creek in 1850. It was a hub of gold mining activity and commerce in the region during the California Gold Rush. The town was largely destroyed by fires in 1855, 1861, 1868, 1871 and 1905.

===Rabbit Creek House===
Rabbit Creek Hotel - Rabbit Creek House was built in 1852 by Eli S. Lester. This was the first building in Rabbit Creek. The Rabbit Creek House had a Hotel, trading post and two barns for horses. Busy during the Gold Rush, the site of the Rabbit Creek Hotel is a California Historical Landmark No. 213 at the north corner of Main Street and Church Streets.

=== Civil War era ===

During the first year of the Civil War some residents wanted to show support for the Rebellion. They raised a Palmetto Flag near Dockery&#x27;s Saloon which was described in one source as &quot;A piece of white cotton cloth, ornamented with a charcoal sketch of a palmetto tree and black snake.&quot; Soon after it was raised the banner was removed.

===Howland Flat and Poker Flat===

About outside La Porte, via the Port Wine Ridge Road in adjacent Sierra County, lies the remains of the former gold mining town of Howland Flat.

Also on Port Wine Ridge Road, and southwest of Mount Fillmore, the ghost town of Grass Flat is located. It is the site of extensive gold rush hydraulic mining, with a dramatic and barren landscape still remaining.

The ghost town of Poker Flat is located on the Poker Flat OHV trail in the Plumas National Forest. The last-standing structure of Poker Flat, the 1886 Scott House, stood until the winter of 2014–15, when it collapsed.

===Sierra longboard racing===

Skiing may have been practiced in Rabbit Creek as early as 1851 by Hamilton Ward and James Murray using improvised barrel staves. In 1866 the Alturas Snowshoe Club was formed at La Porte. This longboard racing association was founded by Creed Haymond to arrange the local Norwegian snow-shoe club tournaments at Onion Valley, Port Wine, St. Louis, Pine Grove, Howland Flat, Newark, Gibsonville, and others. The last annual La Porte tournament was held in 1911, although revivals were held in 1938, 1941, 1951–1952, 1964 and since 1993 at nearby California locations.

California Historical Landmarks 723 and 724 note La Porte as a Pioneer Ski Area of America.
Plumas National Forest Service placed an informational placard atop nearby Lexington Hill, replacing a 1991 Alturas Snowshoe Club marker which commemorated the start of organized downhill ski racing in the western hemisphere.

The railroad tradition also extends to a yearly local event called “Railroad Days”.

Portola was in the national media spotlight in 1996–1997 when a conflict occurred between the local community and the Department of Fish and Game over how to deal with an invasive species of northern pike in Lake Davis. The lake was chemically treated in 1997 to eradicate the fish, but they reappeared in 1999.

<text>Quincy (formerly Quinsy) is a census-designated place and the county seat of Plumas County, California. The population was 1,630 during the 2020 Census, down from 1,728 during the 2010 Census, and 1,879 during the 2000 Census.
==History==
Quincy started as a Gold Rush town, associated with the former Elizabethtown, California. Starting in 1852, Elizabethtown slowly faded.

Development moved a mile away into the American Valley after settler James H. Bradley, who helped organize Plumas County, donated land there for the county seat. He laid out the town and named it after his farm in Illinois that had been named for John Quincy Adams (1767–1848), the sixth president of the United States (1825–1829).

The Quincy post office opened in 1855, and the town was formally recognized in 1858.

==Geography and climate==
Quincy is located at (39.936279, −120.947921).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it is land.

Quincy is underlain by metasedimentary rock of the Shoo Fly Complex. Its dominant silica-rich clastic material weathers to a stony coarse soil which includes the well or somewhat excessively drained alluvial fan material (mainly Forgay very gravelly sandy loam) on which most of Quincy&#x27;s businesses and homes have been built. Cultivated land north of the residential area lies on poorly drained loam, silt loam or fine sandy loam.

Quincy has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;) though its inland location and altitude makes it more continental and wetter than usual for this type, with very heavy snowfalls sometimes occurring in winter – the record being in the very wet January 1916. Although summer days are hot and only 1.4 days per winter fail to top , nights can be very cold and frosts occur on 179 days per year and have been recorded even in July.

<doc id="107902" wikidata="Q806903" url="?curid=107902" title="Banning, California">
<text>Banning is a city in Riverside County, California, United States. Its population was 29,505 as of the 2020 census, down from 29,603 at the 2010 census. It is situated in the San Gorgonio Pass, also known as &quot;Banning Pass&quot;. It is named for Phineas Banning, stagecoach line owner and the &quot;Father of the Port of Los Angeles.&quot;

Banning shares geographic and regional features with its western neighbor, the city of Beaumont. Banning and Beaumont have been rapidly growing in size and population since the 1990s. Both cities are about 80 miles east of downtown Los Angeles and 30 miles west of Palm Springs, both connected by freeway and railroad.

==History==
===Etymology===

Initially named Moore City, by Ransom B. Moore, within only a few months the town was renamed for Phineas Banning, &quot;Father of the Port of Los Angeles&quot;, who had pastured sheep in the San Gorgonio Pass area, and operated a stagecoach that ran through the Pass.

===Early history===
The area, up to the mid-19th century, was inhabited by the Cahuilla people, though the region around Banning was originally Maringayam (Serrano); the Cahuilla expansion into the pass occurred only late in recent, documented history. In 1824, the Mission San Gabriel Arcángel established the &quot;Rancho San Gorgonio&quot; in the pass. The first Anglo to settle in the area was Dr. Isaac Smith in 1853. In 1863, a smallpox epidemic further diminished the Cahuilla. The government created Indian reservations for the Cahuilla in 1877.

The settlement that was to become Banning developed in coincidence with the start of the Colorado River Gold Rush. The Bradshaw Trail, which passed through the area in 1862, was a wagon road to the gold boomtowns of the Arizona Territory. Gilman&#x27;s Ranch, north of downtown, served as a station for the stagecoach lines on this road. The railroad followed, passing through the town in 1876. The Southern Pacific (later purchased by Union Pacific) railroad was a major contributor to the area&#x27;s growth. U.S. Route 99 was built in 1923, followed by U.S. Route 60/70 in 1936, and subsequently Interstate 10.

Banning borders the Morongo Indian Reservation, home to the Morongo Band of Cahuilla (Mission) Indians. Relations with reservation residents have been strained by disputes over water rights. Dorothy Ramon&#x27;s book &quot;Always Believe&quot; (published 2000) depicts a Maringayam&#x27;s views on Banning and reservation life.

Prior to the name Banning, the settlement was called Moore City. Ransom B. Moore operated a large cattle ranch and was later a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, settling in the area and nearby San Gorgonio mountains in the early 1860s. Moore sold his holdings and relocated to central Arizona in 1883.

The town of Banning was incorporated on February 6, 1913.

===Almond production===
In the early 20th century, the area immediately around Banning was considered well fitted to almond culture, and was known as the oldest almond growing district in southern California.

===Indian School and cemetery===
The St. Boniface Indian Industrial School was opened in 1890, providing vocational education to Cahuilla, Serrano, Luiseño, Kumeyaay, and other American Indians. Bishop Francisco Mora y Borrell authorized the school and Mother Katharine Drexel provided funding to the Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions for purchase of the land, construction, and operations. Over its history, about 8,000 students attended the school which was demolished in 1974. A small abandoned cemetery remains.

===World War II===
During World War II, Banning was the site of the 1,000-bed Banning General Hospital. It supported training at the Desert Training Center and was later used as a naval convalescent hospital. The facilities were dismantled in 1948.
In 1942 the citizens of Banning raised funds for the purchase of an M3 Stuart tank to support the war effort. After the war the tank was given to the South African Defence Force. The tank, named &quot;City of Johannesburg&quot;, is preserved at a local museum in Richmond, Natal Province, South Africa.

<text>Beaumont is a city in Riverside County, California, United States, located at the summit of the San Gorgonio Pass, between the San Bernardino Mountains and Mount San Gorgonio to the north, and the San Jacinto Mountains to the south. Over 18 Miles (30 Kilometers) East-Southeast of Beaumont is Mount San Jacinto - Which is part of the San Jacinto Mountains and visible from the city.

== History ==
===Etymology===

Beaumont, which is French for &quot;Beautiful Mountain&quot;, received its name in 1887 from Henry C. Sigler, president of the Southern California Investment Company, because Mount San Jacinto is nearby and visible from the city.

===Early history===
The earliest inhabitants were Native Americans.

During the early 1850s, several surveying parties passed through the vicinity of present-day Beaumont in search of a pass that would connect the east to the Pacific Ocean. The San Gorgonio Pass was first surveyed in 1853 during an expedition under Lieutenant R.S. Williamson, who was sent by the United States government. Its location enthralled many who now saw that connecting to the ocean was a feasible measure and led to plans for constructing a railway from the Missouri River to the Pacific. By the early 1860s, stagecoach lines were providing service through the pass area, and a stage stop was established, named Edgar Station, after a physician from one of the expedition parties who made his home in the area.

In 1875 when the Southern Pacific Railroad laid tracks through the modern-day location of Beaumont, they established a rail station named Summit Station. This served as a rest stop for railway travelers from the Mojave Desert on their way to the Los Angeles vicinity. In 1884 a real estate development company established a town named San Gorgonio. A second real estate development company purchased the town in 1887 and renamed the town Beaumont, which was incorporated on November 18, 1912.

By 1927, the small city had a population of 857 with five churches, a public library, a bank, a high school, two local newspapers, several lumber yards, commercial packing houses, and a dehydrating plant. The city, one of Riverside County&#x27;s largest apple growers, was dubbed &quot;the land of the big red apple&quot; by local residents in its early years. Apple orchards in the area expanded to a $200,000 industry by 1930. Beaumont saw a rise in visitors and residents as the nearby city of Palm Springs grew to become a highly popular resort spot during and after the 1930s; Beaumont followed suit and attempted to capitalize on the increasing tourism by establishing guest ranches. According to an early 1930s/1940s postcard, the Highland Springs Guest Ranch of Beaumont offered its patrons horseback riding, tennis, archery, horseshoes, swimming, shuffle-board, ping pong, baseball, ballroom dancing, massages, basketball, and lodging accommodations.

===20th century growth===

During the Cold War, a Lockheed rocket test site operated by Simi Valley–based Rocketdyne was established south of the town in Potrero Canyon. In late 2003, the majority of the Potrero Canyon site was sold to the state of California. Toxic chemicals used in rocket fuel and site test activities have been found in the soil and groundwater at the site, and planning is underway to begin cleanup sometime in the next few years. Plans are being developed by the California Department of Fish and Game to allow public access.

With the housing boom in the early decade, the urban sprawl reached the last remaining valleys of the Inland Empire. Since 2000, with Beaumont&#x27;s proximity to Los Angeles, various Southern California residents have moved to the San Gorgonio Pass region for its low housing cost, causing a 20% jump in the city&#x27;s population, making it the fastest growing city in the state. This has concerned many local residents who cite increasing student population in schools, rising demand on the water supply, and increasing traffic through the city on Interstate 10 in both directions. A 2008 study by the Public Policy Institute of California noted that Beaumont and its neighboring communities in the nearby San Jacinto Valley have registered the highest population growth throughout Riverside County and that the region was projected to increase by 4.5% a year to 310,000 by 2015.

Beaumont is home to many master-planned communities. The following communities are currently under construction or have been built: Oak Valley Greens, Three Rings Ranch, Solera by Del Webb (later sold to Pulte Homes Inc.), Olivewood by Taylor Morrison, Sundance and Tournament Hills by Pardee Homes, Four Seasons by K. Hovnanian and Fairway Canyon. Except for Oak Valley Greens and Three Rings Ranch, these communities operate under HOAs and are similar to developments in Redlands, Rancho Cucamonga, and some Orange County suburbs.

===Corruption allegations===
In May 2016, prosecutors announced that they were charging almost all of Beaumont&#x27;s former government leadership with corruption they said had been going on for three decades. Seven former officials were arrested and charged with stealing nearly $43 million from city coffers. Former City Manager Alan Kapanicas, former Economic Development Director David William Dillon, former Public Works Director Deepak Moorjani, former Planning Director Ernest Alois Egger, former Finance Director William Kevin Aylward, former City Atty. Joseph Sandy Aklufi and former Police Chief Francis Dennis Coe Jr. were accused of using their public offices to enrich themselves personally and secure interest-free loans for friends and colleagues with taxpayer money. Bail for Kapanicas, Aylward, Aklufi, Dillon, Moorjani and Egger was set at $5 million each, while Coe&#x27;s bail was set at $100,000. The criminal probe began in April 2015 when investigators with the Riverside County district attorney&#x27;s office and the FBI raided City Hall and seized records, computers and other items. All seven defendants pleaded guilty to offenses in plea bargains during 2017–2018.

==Geography==
Beaumont&#x27;s neighboring cities are Banning to the east and Calimesa to the northwest.

With an elevation of above sea level, Beaumont is at the peak on the San Gorgonio Pass between San Bernardino and Palm Springs, neighboring the Interstate 10 and State Route 60 freeways. If driving east to Banning or west to Calimesa, drivers can feel a gradual downward slope.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which 99.96% is land and 0.04% is water.

===Climate===
Beaumont reaches an average high of during the summer and an average low of during the winter. Due to its higher elevation, it is usually - colder than its neighboring lower-elevation cities, such as Moreno Valley, Hemet, San Jacinto, and the Palm Springs desert area. Snow does fall, but it usually doesn&#x27;t stick for more than a couple of hours. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Beaumont has a Hot-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csa&quot; on climate maps.

Beaumont&#x27;s slightly cooler temperatures and less air pollution, relative to its neighboring lower-elevation cities, make it a desirable area for development in the Inland Empire region. However, it is one of the windiest cities in Southern California, along with San Bernardino, Fontana, and Victorville.

Annual precipitation is approximately .

<text>Blythe () is a city in eastern Riverside County, California, United States. It is in the Palo Verde Valley of the Lower Colorado River Valley region, an agricultural area and part of the Colorado Desert along the Colorado River, approximately east of Los Angeles and west of Phoenix. Blythe was named after Thomas Henry Blythe, a San Francisco financier, who established primary water rights to the Colorado River in the region in 1877. The city was incorporated on July 21, 1916. The population was 18,317 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Native Americans lived in the area.
===Etymology===

Blythe was named after Thomas Henry Blythe, a San Francisco businessman and entrepreneur. Mr. Blythe established primary water rights to the Colorado River in the southwestern California region in 1877. The town was originally named Blythe City, by Thomas Blythe, but the name was shortened to simply &quot;Blythe&quot; around the time the first post office was opened in 1908.

===Early years===

In the early or mid-1870s, William Calloway (known as Oliver Calloway in some sources), an engineer and a former captain of the 1st California Infantry Regiment, explored an area across the Colorado River from Ehrenberg, Arizona, and found its potential for development. Calloway made preliminary surveys and filed land claims under the Swamp Land Act of 1850. He interested the wealthy San Francisco capitalist Thomas Henry Blythe (originally born Thomas Williams in Mold, Wales) to undertake development and settlement of an &quot;empire&quot; located next to the Colorado. Together they purchased a total of 140,000 acres under the Swamp Land Act, and another 35,000 acres under the Desert Land Act of 1877.

On July 17, 1877, Blythe filed his first claim for Colorado River water on what was to become the &quot;Blythe Intake&quot;. Blythe appointed another man named George Irish as manager to assist Calloway in building an irrigation system. Calloway died in a Chemehuevi attack on March 28, 1880, and was replaced by C.C. Miller, the father of Frank Augustus Miller. Thomas Blythe died on April 4, 1883; his only revisit to the valley was in November 1882. After his death, the work in the valley halted and Blythe&#x27;s estate subsequently went into litigation between his illegitimate daughter Florence and other claimants, the trial beginning in 1889. In the 1900s, Florence was awarded the estate, after several years of preceding rulings in favor of her and appeals against her.

===20th century===
Frank Murphy and Ed Williams, who were involved with the cattle industry in southeastern Arizona, came to the area in 1904 and were convinced it was well-suited for cattle and farming. With the Hobson brothers from Ventura County, they bought Blythe&#x27;s estate and formed the Palo Verde Land and Water Company. During 1911–1912, W.F. Holt, who helped develop nearby Imperial Valley, was the company&#x27;s general manager.

On August 8, 1916, the California Southern Railroad reached Blythe from the desert station of Rice, then known as Blythe Junction. It was later renamed to honor G.W. Rice, an engineer and superintendent of the railroad. The dramatic growth in the valley following this event attracted national attention. Production totals increased annually from virtually nothing to near $8,000,000 in few years, primarily from cotton and cotton seed shipped to the ports. The lower cotton prices in 1920 ended this prosperous time. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway began leasing the line in 1921 and acquired it at the end of 1942.

The first automobile bridge over the Colorado River between Blythe and Ehrenberg was constructed in 1928 to replace a cable ferry service. The bridge&#x27;s successor was built in the early 1960s and was expanded to four lanes and a pedestrian walkway in early 1974.

In 1935, the completion of Boulder Dam extinguished the annual destructive floods in the valley. As noted during the city&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary, some forty crops were grown on the farms, and large cattle feeds were another aspect of the agriculture industry. As of 1947, the Fisher ranch had the biggest herd of registered Brahman cattle in California, the breeding stock having been sold to western states and other countries.

During World War II, Blythe was the site of United States Army Air Forces facilities at the Blythe Airport and the Gary Field.

In 1972, Interstate 10 was built through the city, replacing US 60 and the previously decommissioned US 70 on Hobsonway as the main thoroughfare.

===21st century===
In 2016, the voter-approved recreational use of cannabis in California has made the cannabis industry drawn to the economically declined city due to lower land prices, water, and potentially lower taxes compared to other parts of the state.

<text>Cabazon (Spanish: &quot;Cabazón&quot;) is an unincorporated community in Riverside County, California, United States. Cabazon is on the Pacific Crest Trail.
In the 21st century, the area has become a tourist stop, due to the Morongo Casino, Resort &amp; Spa and Desert Hills Premium Outlets. The population was 2,535 during the 2010 Census. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Cabazon as a census-designated place (CDP).

==History==
Cabazon was initially established as a settlement in the 1870s after the Southern Pacific Railroad built a railroad station there. The station was originally named &quot;Jacinto,&quot; but was renamed &quot;Cabezone&quot; after the Spanish name of a nearby Indian &quot;rancheria.&quot; The Spanish had named the latter after a chief of the Cahuilla Indians during the colonial period. He was named for his large head.

In the late 19th century, a workers&#x27; camp known as Hall&#x27;s Siding, which included a hotel and dance hall, developed. It was abandoned after the railroad relocated its facilities. In 1884 a new town was laid out by the Scottish-owned Cabazon Land and Water Company, which established a fruit farm. Some lots were sold, but were later repurchased.

The large plot of land stayed intact until it was bought by a developer in 1910. The developer established a school and a post office, but was unable to attract many residents.
Cabazon was incorporated as a city on November 1, 1955. Under California law, incorporated cities could host cardrooms, while unincorporated areas could not. Some businessmen hoped that cardrooms would attract new residents and businesses. During the next 16 years, the city struggled with scandal, political instability, and stalled growth, as cardroom operators vied with other landowners and residents for control of the city government.

In its first seven years, a succession of 18 police chiefs and 21 City Council members served for short terms in the city. One key dispute was between residents who hoped that Cabazon could be developed as a resort city like Palm Springs to the east, versus cardroom owners who wanted to keep Cabazon&#x27;s population low so that the city government&#x27;s operating expenses (and their taxes) would remain low and not impinge on their profits.

In a popular tactic of small jurisdictions, the city turned then-U.S. Route 60 down Main Street into a speed trap; it raised as much as $19,000 per year by fines from speeding tickets. That revenue stream vanished when Interstate 10 was completed in California circa 1964, and US Route 60 was decommissioned. A cardroom operator sued the City Council over its attempt to raise the license fee for cardrooms. This infuriated those landowners and residents who did not profit from the city&#x27;s cardrooms. They sought to shut down the city so that the cardrooms would also be forced to shut down.

On September 14, 1971, the city&#x27;s electorate voted in a special election, 192 to 131 in favor of disincorporation. The election results were upheld by the state courts, and the city government disincorporated in 1972.

With changing demographics and regional economy, locals in the early 21st century have intermittently discussed reincorporating the area.

<doc id="107907" wikidata="Q2346469" url="?curid=107907" title="Calimesa, California">
<text>Calimesa (portmanteau of &quot;California&quot; and &quot;Mesa&quot;, Spanish for &quot;table&quot;) is a city in Riverside County, California, United States in the Greater Los Angeles area. The population was 7,879 at the 2010 census, up from 7,139 at the 2000 census. It is situated in the San Gorgonio Pass.

==History==
===Etymology===

Historically, Calimesa began as a small rural town with mostly single-family homes and ranches. With completion of U.S. Route 99 (modern day I-10), businesses opened and Calimesa began to take on a separate identity from the larger neighboring town of Yucaipa. In June 1929, nearly 100 residents attended a meeting and decided to apply for their own post office and to start a “name contest” in which the winner was paid $10. Calimesa was chosen from 107 names submitted, and is said to come from “cali” (referring to California) and “mesa” from the Spanish word meaning &quot;table&quot; or &quot;table-lands.&quot; The first post office was the grocery store at Calimesa Boulevard and Avenue K.

===Beginnings===
Serrano people and the Cahuilla people inhabited the area.

The modern history of the area was initiated with the establishment of Spanish missions in Alta California in 1769. The need for a land route to these missions inspired Captain Juan Bautista de Anza to lead a party through the area in 1774. As early as 1820, reference can be found to the messenger footpath for the missions in Arizona to the San Gabriel Mission.

The Assistencia in Redlands (which has been rebuilt), and Rancho San Gorgonio, were part of the San Gabriel Mission located near today&#x27;s Los Angeles. The San Gorgonio &quot;rancheria&quot; covered most of the San Gorgonio Pass area. A site within the rancheria, the location of the present Highland Springs Ranch &amp; Inn, along with Whitewater, and a house at the east end of present-day Singleton Road in Calimesa, all became stage stops along this path.

The post office reinforced the residents&#x27; feeling of a community separate from the town of Yucaipa. In 1939 or 1940, the Calimesa Improvement Association, Inc. was formed. According to the constitution of the association, “The object and purpose of the association shall be the development and improvement of Calimesa and The Community”. Volunteers built a community center at the corner of Bryant and Avenue H, which had been designated a park site by the Redlands-Yucaipa Land Company. The &quot;South Mesa Water Company&quot; purchased the land for a well site and allowed the association to use it for community events.

In 1962, the Calimesa Improvement Association became the Calimesa Chamber of Commerce. The Improvement Association and the Chamber have operated as a mix of promoting Calimesa, providing community service, and being a sounding board for residents’ problems. Prior to 1949, the fire protection for the valley was provided by the California Department of Forestry at the Avenue A station, which today is the office of County Service Area 63 in Yucaipa. Calimesa community members felt the need for more protection on the south side of the wash, so in 1949 they formed the Volunteer Fire Department.

===Incorporation===
The City of Calimesa was incorporated on December 1, 1990, soon after the incorporation of its northern neighbor, the City of Yucaipa. Prior to its incorporation, the City of Calimesa existed as an unincorporated census designated town that straddled the Riverside–San Bernardino County line at the location where Interstate 10 climbs the San Gorgonio Pass going eastward from Redlands, California.

===Future===
The previous decade saw several planned communities approved for development within the city, including the JP Ranch Development (approximately 750 total homes), Calimesa Springs Development (approximately 270 homes), Summerwind Ranch at Oak Valley (3,841 homes, 260 acres of mixed-use commercial), and Mesa Verde (3,500 homes, and 64 acres of mixed-use commercial space). The number of approved units currently outnumbers the total population within the city. However, development of these large tracts have been slow to move forward until the demand increases.

==Sandalwood Fire==
The fire burned for five days.

==Transportation==
The city is accessible from Interstate 10, which geographically traverses the city from north to south. Major transportation corridors include County Line Road (which runs east–west from the freeway), Sandalwood Drive (which runs east–west from the freeway), Singleton Road (which runs east–west from the freeway), Cherry Valley Boulevard (which runs east–west from the freeway), Avenue &quot;L&quot; (which runs east–west from the freeway), Myrtlewood Drive (which runs east–west from Calimesa Boulevard to California Street), Calimesa Boulevard (which runs north–south and parallels the freeway from Live Oak Canyon Road in Yucaipa to Cherry Valley Boulevard/Tukwet Canyon Parkway near Beaumont), and Bryant Street (which runs north–south from Highway 38/Mill Creek Road/Mentone Boulevard and connects with Singleton Road). The city has no airports or direct access to railroads.

==Geography==
The city is located in the northwestern portion of Riverside County, between Yucaipa and Beaumont. It is within the Yucaipa Valley section of Southern California&#x27;s Inland Valley, and at the western edge of the San Gorgonio Pass between San Bernardino and Palm Springs. Calimesa is located in the region known as the Inland Empire, which covers San Bernardino and Riverside Counties.

Situated within the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains, the city&#x27;s elevation ranges between above sea level.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

===City limits===
Historically, Calimesa is divided from the City of Yucaipa by the Wildwood Canyon Wash; politically, &quot;County Line Road&quot; divides the two towns. Much of what was originally known as &quot;Calimesa&quot; actually lies within the city boundaries of Yucaipa, including &quot;I-Street&quot; (Calimesa) Park and Calimesa Elementary School. Because State of California law prohibits the incorporation or annexation of cities over county lines, the city was unable to adjoin what was considered the town of Calimesa when it finally incorporated. When Yucaipa incorporated, it included the area outside of the Yucaipa Valley on the &quot;hilltop&quot; or &quot;mesa&quot; that was traditionally known as Calimesa within its city boundaries, so as not to leave a gap of unincorporated area between the two towns. Although the two cities are in separate counties, both Yucaipa and Calimesa share the same basic street grid system and addressing, including many named and alphabetical streets which extend from Yucaipa well into Calimesa. The general boundary between the two cities is County Line Road, which does not follow the exact county line in some places due to the alignment of Calimesa Creek, which meanders in and out of both Yucaipa and Calimesa.

The city limits of Calimesa also extend south to the City of Beaumont, California. Although much less refined, the boundaries between Beaumont and Calimesa fall generally along the Southern California Edison (SCE) right-of-way that extends from the El Casco electrical sub-station facility near Moreno Valley, California, eastward. Near Interstate 10, Champions Drive is the common boundary between the two cities.

==Education==
Public education for most Calimesa children is provided by the Yucaipa-Calimesa Joint Unified School District, with the remaining southernmost area now served by the neighboring Beaumont Unified School District.

===Schools===
The City of Calimesa is within two school districts; the Yucaipa-Calimesa Joint Unified School District serves the western portion of the city, while the southeastern end of the city is served by the Beaumont Unified School District. There is currently only one public school in Calimesa, Mesa View Middle School, which opened in late August 2009. Mesa View was built to be the school district&#x27;s second high school. However, due to a slowdown in home construction, the district is facing declining enrollment. As a result, Mesa View will remain a middle school until growth requires a change. In November 2017, a 13-year-old student at Mesa View Middle School who was frequently bullied committed suicide, increasing global awareness about bullying and suicide among young adults.

Calimesa Elementary School is actually located within the City of Yucaipa, and high school students attend Yucaipa High School. Calimesa&#x27;s only currently-operating elementary school—and only currently operating high school—is Mesa Grande Academy, a private K-12 school owned by the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

<text>Canyon Lake is a city and gated community in Riverside County, California, United States, located on Canyon Lake reservoir. Canyon Lake began as a master-planned community developed by the Corona Land Company in 1968. The City of Canyon Lake was incorporated on December 1, 1990. Railroad Canyon Dam was built in 1927, and impounds the San Jacinto River to fill the reservoir, which covers and has of shoreline.

==History==
===Etymology===

The city of Canyon Lake is named after the reservoir it is built around. Initially, the reservoir was known as Railroad Canyon Reservoir, or Railroad Canyon Lake, but now the reservoir and the community are referred to by the shortened form, Canyon Lake.

===Early history===
In 1882, the California Southern Railroad built a line from Perris to Elsinore along the east side of the San Jacinto River. The Santa Fe Railroad bought the line and joined it with their line in San Bernardino. Floods in 1884, 1916, and 1927 washed out the tracks, and the Santa Fe Railroad decided to abandon the line. Soon after the last flood, the Temescal Water Company bought the railroad right-of-way, as well as from Henry Evans, a rancher, and another land from B.T. Kuert. Those were the two parcels that make up most of Canyon Lake today.

Construction started in 1927 to build a dam across the river to store water. It was finished in 1929. Railroad Canyon Reservoir, when built, was one of the largest freshwater lakes for fishing, hunting, and camping in Southern California. The reservoir and the surrounding area were leased as a concession from Temescal Water Company as a recreational area under the operation of the George D. Evans family from 1937 until after World War II. After the war Ray and Alpha Schekel, along with John and Darleen Kirkland, operated the resort until 1949 when the lake was drained for repairs to the floodgates.

In recent years, specialized code enforcement officers have also maintained patrols of the approximately parcel of land administered by the Bureau of Land Management which encompasses the eastern shore of the lake in its upper reaches. The trail running north along the eastern shore of the lake has become an inviting activity for hikers and birdwatchers, particularly in the winter months when the hills are green and temperatures lower. Canyon Lake forbids all public use of any &quot;two-wheeled motorized vehicle&quot; (that is, all motorcycles, mopeds, and dirt bikes) on all private streets throughout the CLPOA, but excluding the two public roads (Railroad Canyon and Goetz Roads).

===Transportation===
Canyon Lake is located approximately east of Interstate 15 and west of Interstate 215. Railroad Canyon Road is the main public road in Canyon Lake, providing direct access to the neighboring cities of Lake Elsinore and Menifee. Goetz Road connects the eastern portion of Canyon Lake to the community of Quail Valley and the city of Perris.

==In popular culture==
In 2006, the community was the subject of &quot;United Gates of America&quot;, a BBC television documentary directed by Alex Cooke, featuring journalist Charlie LeDuff. He lived in the community for a month to explore why people wanted to live behind gates and fences, and what effect it had on the residents. LeDuff also explored the issues of immigration from Mexico and Central America, and highlighted the issues of segregation and racism that exist in the United States. The film was the subject of some controversy within the community, but received positive reviews in the UK and other parts of the US.

<doc id="107909" wikidata="Q578518" url="?curid=107909" title="Cathedral City, California">
<text>Cathedral City, colloquially known as &quot;Cat City&quot;, is a desert resort city in Riverside County, California, United States, within the Colorado Desert&#x27;s Coachella Valley. Situated between Palm Springs and Rancho Mirage, the city has the second largest population, after Indio, of the nine cities in the Coachella Valley. Its population was 51,493 at the 2020 census, a slight increase from 51,200 at the 2010 census.

Prior to the arrival of European colonists, the land was part of the territory inhabited by the Cahuilla Indians. Today every other square mile of the city is part of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians reservation land. Development of a town began when a housing subdivision was built in 1925. It became an incorporated municipality in 1981.

The city&#x27;s name is derived from Cathedral Canyon located to the south of the city in the foothills of the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument. The canyon is said to have received its name because certain rock formations in the canyon were reminiscent of a cathedral. A flood in August 1946 significantly altered the cathedral-like features of the canyon.

In the United Kingdom a population center needs to have city status, and a cathedral, in order to be called a cathedral city. This prompted Robert Ripley to include the town of Cathedral City in his December 9, 1939, &quot;Believe It Or Not&quot; column stating, &quot;Believe it or not … there is no church in Cathedral City, Calif. It is named after a canyon&quot;.

==History==
===Early history: before 1860===
Cathedral City sits at the northwestern end of the Coachella Valley between the San Bernardino Mountains to the north, and the San Jacinto Mountains to the south, with the San Gorgonio Pass to the West. The earliest established inhabitants of this region were the Cahuilla Indians. They arrived in the area around 3,000 BCE.
The Cahuilla were organized into bands of about 600 to 800 people, and it was the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians who inhabited the lands that included what would become Cathedral City.

The land was claimed by Spain in 1768 when Spain established Las Californias, a province of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, and then by Mexico in 1821 when Mexico and Spain signed the Treaty of Cordoba. At that time the province had already been renamed and expanded into the larger Alta California province. After the Mexican–American War, and with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, possession of the land was formally transferred to the United States, and it officially became part of the State of California when the state was formed in 1850.
In 1852 US Army Colonel Henry Washington, a nephew of President George Washington, was contracted by the government to survey Southern California.
On November 7 of that year he established the initial point, in the San Bernardino Mountains, from which all subsequent surveys in Southern California would be based.
In 1855 he was contracted to continue his work and survey the Coachella Valley. It was then that he found and named Cathedral Canyon for which Cathedral City would eventually be named.

Besides Colonel Henry Washington, there were occasional explorers, colonizers and soldiers that made their way through the area during the Spanish, Mexican, and early American eras, but none established any permanent structures or residences. The Cahuilla remained the only people known to be living in the area.

===Stage and freight lines 1860 – early 20th century===
Prior to the 1860s the only regularly traveled routes through the Coachella Valley were trading paths used by the Cahuilla and other Native American tribes. One of these paths, on the southwestern side of the valley, followed the base of the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa mountains somewhere near the Whitewater River, and would have passed through the area that would become Cathedral City. Early non-native explorers, surveyors, and military, such as Colonel Washington, made use of these routes, but regular transportation services were not established until 1862.
The Colorado River Gold Rush, which started in the spring of 1862, prompted William D. Bradshaw, a frontiersman, to seek a quicker route from Los Angeles to the Colorado River. Later that year he hired a guide, and with the help of the Cahuilla and Maricopa Indians, mapped a route from San Bernardino, California, through the San Gorgonio Pass and Coachella Valley, past the northern shore of the Salton Sink, through the passes between the Chuckwalla and Chocolate Mountains, and up to the Colorado River across from La Paz in the New Mexico Territory, (now the state of Arizona). Much of the route is thought to have followed the original southwestern trading path used by the Cahuilla.

Shortly after Bradshaw defined the trail from San Bernardino to La Paz, various stagecoach and freight companies began using the route. The stage and freight lines brought miners, supplies, and mail between San Bernardino and La Paz, and the route became known as the Bradshaw Trail or &quot;Gold Road&quot;. The Bradshaw trail, like the original Cahuillian trail, passed through the future Cathedral City, but the nearest scheduled stops were Agua Caliente (now Palms Springs), and Indian Wells (now Indio). The stage and freight lines were eventually supplanted by the railroads, but the trail would later become the basis for Palm Canyon Drive and Highway 111 that run through the city today.

<text>Cherry Valley is a census-designated place (CDP) in Riverside County, California, United States. The population was 6,362 at the 2010 census, up from 5,891 at the 2000 census. It is situated at the most northwestern point of the San Gorgonio Pass.

The area was planted with many cherry trees, for which Cherry Valley was named. While many of the trees have long since been removed and replaced with homes, a few can still be spotted in backyards throughout the area.

==History==
In the early 1800s, the area was known as Rancho San Gorgonio, an outpost for the San Gabriel Mission. A large portion of the area was a Spanish Land Grant made to a man by the name of Paulino Weaver. In 1853, Weaver sold some of his land to Dr. Isaac William Smith, who was struck by the land&#x27;s natural beauty while looking for stray cattle. Dr. Smith purchased a 1,000 acres for $1,000 from Weaver and established Smith Ranch and Highland Springs Ranch &amp; Inn. The original Smith residence stood near where the swimming pool is today. In 1862, Smith&#x27;s ranch was dubbed &quot;Smith Station&quot; and was made a stagecoach stop. In 1865, a young Wyatt Earp drove the route from San Bernardino to La Paz, Arizona on which Smith Station was a popular stop.

From 1864 to 1866, the route through Highland Springs along the Bradshaw Trail was the single connecting line for passenger, mail and the express travel between Southern California and the eastern regions of the nation. Smith&#x27;s Station slowly developed into a hotel bustling with traffic. In 1884, the Smith property was purchased by a Los Angeles company that built a three-story hotel on the property called Highland Home. The first cherry trees in the area were planted here, contributing to the name that it is still known by today.

In 1927, Fred and William Hirsch bought the old Smith place, renamed it Highland Springs Resort, and developed it into a health resort. Fred Hirsch himself was made healthy through following the philosophy of Professor Arnold Ehret, who was an early proponent of juice fasting and colon cleansing. The restaurant on the resort was vegetarian and Hirsch grew a lot of the produce served at the restaurant on the property. He also grew his own grapes and operated a small vineyard. The resort became known as &quot;The Last Resort&quot; as many sick people who were not able to get well with traditional methods, were able to recover through Hirsch&#x27;s health practices while staying at the resort. From 1941 to 1945 there was a large World War 2 medical treatment facility at the site:Cherry Valley Hospital.

<doc id="107911" wikidata="Q948219" url="?curid=107911" title="Coachella, California">
<text>Coachella ( , ) is a city in Riverside County, California, United States. It is the namesake and easternmost city of the Coachella Valley, in Southern California&#x27;s Colorado Desert. Originally a railroad town, Coachella is a prominent hub for agriculture and shipping across Southern California and the Western United States.

Coachella today is one of California&#x27;s fastest-growing cities; when it incorporated in 1946, it had 1,000 residents. By the 2020 Census, the population had grown to 41,941. The city is officially bilingual in English and Spanish, with 90% of people speaking Spanish.

== History ==

The city was founded as Woodspur in 1876, when the Southern Pacific Railroad built a rail siding on the site. In the 1880s the indigenous Cahuilla tribe sold their land plots to the railroads for new lands east of the current town site, and in the 1890s, a few hundred traqueros settled along the tracks. In 1901, the citizens of Woodspur voted on a new name for their community and at a town hall meeting settled on &quot;Coachella&quot;.

The origin of the name &quot;Coachella&quot; is unclear. Some locals believe it was a misspelling of &quot;conchilla&quot;, a Spanish word for the small white snail shells found in the valley&#x27;s sandy soil, vestiges of a lake that dried up over 3,000 years ago.

Coachella began as a territory gridded out on the mesquite-covered desert floor. Coachella became a city in 1946. During the incorporation voting process, the first city council was tentatively elected.

In the 1950s Coachella begin to expand into its range, about , an area which contained large year-round agricultural corporate farms and fruit groves, particularly of citrus (lemons, oranges, grapefruit) and date palms.

By the 1980 census, Coachella&#x27;s population had reached at least 10,000 due to relatively slow population growth. Due to a high percentage of Hispanics in the city, Coachella was a scene of Chicano political activism. The agricultural area surrounding Coachella was where the United Farm Workers union staged strikes and protests, including visits by UFW leader César Chávez in the 1960s and 1970s. In 2018, Harrison Street (the main street in town) was renamed for him.

In 1995, state and federal officials designated Coachella as part of the Coachella Valley Enterprise Zone to boost economic activity and entice businesses to relocate to this rural city which was once home to several fruit shipping plants.

In 2010, a Coca-Cola bottling facility (a LEED certified building) was added to the city&#x27;s new light industry facilities, a boon in the rapid-growth community which has a currently troubled economy.

== Geography ==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

The elevation is below sea level, as the eastern half of the Coachella Valley is below sea level. The saltwater lake, Salton Sea, south of Coachella, is below sea level.

=== Climate ===
This climate is dominated in all months by the subtropical anticyclone, or subtropical high, with its descending air, elevated inversions, and clear skies. Although only a short distance from Banning, California which has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, it also lies in a rainshadow that allows Coachella only about one-fourth the precipitation of Banning. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Bwh&quot;. (Tropical and Subtropical Desert Climate).

== Demographics ==

Despite its image for Mexican immigration, a large percentage are US citizens, born and raised in Coachella. A multi-generational Mexican American culture has taken root in the town, including a significant portion particularly from the Mexican state of Sinaloa.

Much of the population consists of younger Latino families (an estimated 90 percent of Hispanic origin) and, in the outlying areas, migrant farm workers. The city is officially bilingual in the English and Spanish languages, though city council meetings are held in English. Historically, apart from the Hispanic/Latino and/or Native Americans, other ethnic groups in Coachella included Arabs, Armenians, Filipinos, Italians, Japanese, and recent immigrants from Southeast Asia and the former Yugoslavia.

Near the city limits of Coachella are three casinos on Indian reservations: Fantasy Springs Resort and Casino, Spotlight 29 Casino, and Augustine Casino, which are owned and operated by Native American tribes – the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, Twentynine Palms Band of Mission Indians, and Augustine Band of Cahuilla Indians, respectively. These small but highly profitable tribes have representative councils to ensure self-reliance as a community. Coachella is also home to a significant Southwest Indian (Apache, Hopi, Navajo and Zuni) population, though not indigenous to the California desert region.

== Housing and recreation ==
Since 2000, thousands of single-family homes and multi-unit apartment complexes have been built at a fast pace, as the city&#x27;s population soared, having more than doubled in just a decade.

In 2015, the number of unpermitted trailer parks, often housing farmworkers, was estimated at &quot;dozens if not more than 100.&quot; Many of these parks are in poor condition. Some have dirt roads and frequent power outages, or drinking water supplies contaminated with arsenic or hexavalent chromium. It is uncertain whether it would be more practical to bring in city water and sewer lines, or to simply start over with new developments. Given that a recent 181-unit development, Mountain View Estates, required over 28 million dollars in funding, the nonprofit Pueblo Unido Community Development Corp. is pushing for code upgrades of existing facilities. A court case which alleged that the county had made an intentional effort to close trailer parks with Latino populations was settled in 2000. The US$21 million from the settlement was used to build three farmworker housing projects. As of 2015, dirt roads in 35 trailer parks are being paved as part of a US$3.4 million county project.

Coachella expanded recreational and social activities for which residents once had to drive west. The city has a recreation center, a Boys and Girls Club center, and a boxing club in Bagdouma Park. There are two dance clubs and the Corona Yacht Club located near Spotlight 29 casino; two new golf courses (Desert Lakes and the Vineyards) attract many retirees, RV owners, and local business people.

== Events and points of interest ==
Three popular fiestas are celebrated each year in town: Cinco de Mayo (May 5), the 16 de Septiembre Fiestas Patrias (Mexico&#x27;s Independence from Spain) and the 12 de Diciembre (the patron saint of Mexico, Santa Maria de Guadalupe) to celebrate the Virgin Mary.

Coachella is served by the Coachella Valley Unified School District, based in Thermal, California. Its main high school is Coachella Valley High School (with 2900 students) followed by a new high school, Desert Mirage High School, about 5 miles to the south; its three middle schools are Cahuilla Desert Academy, Toro Canyon, and Bobby Duke. Elementary schools include Cesar Chavez, Coral Mountain Academy, Palm View, Peter Pendleton, Valle Del Sol, Valley View, Westside and in nearby Thermal, John Kelley.

The Coachella Valley Adult School, in operation since 1952, is the third-largest adult school in Riverside County. It offers seven levels of English as a Second Language (ESL), and has offered citizenship classes for over 20 years. In the last ten years, over 1,500 people completed citizenship classes at the school and submitted N-400 forms.

== Public safety ==
The Riverside County Sheriff&#x27;s Department provides law enforcement for the city from the nearby Thermal Regional Station. The original Coachella Police Department was absorbed by the Sheriff&#x27;s Department in 1998.

The city of Coachella contracts for fire and paramedic services with the Riverside County Fire Department through a cooperative agreement with CAL FIRE.

== Transportation ==
Near Coachella, a new four-lane expressway, State Route 86, was built for international trucking from Mexicali, Mexico to Los Angeles or Arizona. Referred to as the &quot;NAFTA highway&quot; (in reference to the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect in 1994), it replaces an older and less safe two-lane road known as the &quot;killer highway, deadly highway, and death highway&quot; where over 400 auto accident fatalities took place since 1980.

A plan is being developed for new passenger rail service that would span approximately 144 miles from Los Angeles Union Station (LAUS) to Coachella. Construction would take an estimated ten years following completion of an Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIR).

<text>Corona (Spanish for &quot;Crown&quot;) is a city in northwestern Riverside County, California, United States. Its current mayor is Jim Steiner. At the 2020 census, the city had a population of 157,136, up from 152,374 at the 2010 census. Corona is surrounded by Riverside to the east, Norco to the north and northeast, Yorba Linda to the northwest, Cleveland National Forest and the Santa Ana Mountains to the west, southwest, and south. Several unincorporated communities are along the rest of the city&#x27;s borders. Downtown Corona is approximately southeast of Downtown Los Angeles and north-northwest of San Diego.

Corona, located along the western edge of Southern California&#x27;s Inland Empire region, is known as the &quot;Circle City&quot; due to Grand Boulevard&#x27;s circular layout. It is one of the most residential cities in the Inland Empire, but also has a large industrial portion on the northern half, being the headquarters of companies such as Fender Musical Instruments Corporation, Monster Beverage Corporation, and supercar manufacturer Saleen.

== Etymology ==

Corona is Spanish for &quot;crown&quot; or &quot;wreath&quot;. Originally called South Riverside, citizens wanted to distinguish their city from the larger city of Riverside to the north. When it came time to incorporate the city a number of different names were considered, but the name Corona was chosen to play upon a unique feature of the city, the one-mile diameter drive that circled the center of the town.

==History==
=== Indigenous ===

Prior to the late eighteenth century, the area was primarily inhabited by the Tongva and Payómkawichum, who lived in a series of villages throughout the area. What is now Corona stood at the southeastern extent of Tovaangar, or the Tongva world, and at the northern edge of Payómkawichum territory.

The primary settlement in the area was the village of Paxauxa, which was established along the banks of the Temescal Creek at about where Corona is situated today. The settlement was shared by both the Tongva and Payómkawichum people. Cooperation and marriage between the two villages was common. High above the city of Corona, the village of Pamajam was also located in a small valley of the Santa Ana Mountains.

=== Colonial period ===
The founding of Mission San Juan Capistrano in 1776 and Mission San Luis Rey in 1798 saw the introduction of Spanish soldiers and missionaries in the area. This resulted in villagers being brought to the mission to be baptized and as labor.

Spanish influence increased in the area with the establishment of the San Antonio de Pala Asistencia in 1816. Two years following the construction of this mission outpost, the Temescal Valley&#x27;s first European resident, Leandro Serrano, was given permission by the Spanish to use the area for cattle grazing. His first order was to kill the local bear and mountain lion population for the imported herds.

After the secularization of the Spanish missions by the First Mexican Republic in 1833, the land under influence by the missions in Alta California was gradually granted to large landowners as ranches. In 1848, Californio governor Pio Pico issued this land to Bernardo Yorba, which included present-day city of Corona.

===Establishment===
Corona was founded at the height of the Southern California citrus boom in 1886, and is situated at the upper end of the Santa Ana River Canyon, a significant pass through the Santa Ana Mountains. The town of Corona was once the &quot;Lemon Capital of the World&quot;. A museum there presents the lemon&#x27;s former role in the local economy. The city&#x27;s name means crown in Spanish due to the circular shape of a crown and the circular shape of Grand Blvd. The nickname of Corona is &quot;The Circle City&quot; from the unique layout of its streets, with a standard grid enclosed by the circular Grand Boulevard, in circumference. The street layout was designed by Hiram Clay Kellogg, a civil engineer from Anaheim who was an influential figure in the early development of Orange County.

Corona was established as a town by the South Riverside Land and Water Company. The company was incorporated in 1886; founding members included ex-Governor of Iowa Samuel Merrill, R.B. Taylor, George L. Joy, A.S. Garretson, and Adolph Rimpau. Originally a citrus growers&#x27; organization, it purchased the lands of Rancho La Sierra of Bernardo Yorba, and the Rancho Temescal grant and the colony of South Riverside was laid out. They also secured the water rights to Temescal Creek, its tributaries and Lee Lake. Dams and pipelines were built to carry the water to the colony. In 1889, the Temescal Water Company was incorporated, to supply water for the new colony. This company purchased all the water-bearing lands in the Temescal valley and began drilling artesian wells.

Originally located in San Bernardino County, the city was named &quot;South Riverside&quot; and received its post office in that name on either May 27 or August 11, 1887 with Charles H. Cornell as the town&#x27;s first postmaster. In 1893, South Riverside became part of the new Riverside County. In 1896, the city was renamed &quot;Corona&quot; for its circular Grand Boulevard, where three international automobile races were held in 1913, 1914 and 1916.

===20th century===

The city of Corona has been popular among celebrities drawn to its upscale areas and relative privacy compared to Los Angeles. Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz spent time at their ranch, located in north Corona, and played golf often at the Cresta Verde Golf Course in the northeastern section of the city. After their divorce, Arnaz continued to live in Corona.

In recent years Corona has been known as the &quot;Gateway to the Inland Empire&quot;. In April of 1980 David Felix became Corona&#x27;s first Hispanic Mayor. Main Street Realtors wrote, &quot;Prior to the 1980s, the city was largely an agricultural community, dominated by citrus orchards, ranches, and dairy farms. High real estate prices in Los Angeles and Orange counties made the area&#x27;s land desirable to developers and industrialists, and by the late 1990s Corona was considered a major suburb of Los Angeles.&quot;

===21st century===
In 2002, the city government considered an initiative to secede from Riverside County and form an autonomous Corona County because the city government and some residents were dissatisfied with how services were handled in nearby areas. The effort was also considered by areas in other cities in the western part of the county as far south as Murrieta. Whether nearby cities such as Norco would have been included in the new county are unknown. The proposed county would have been bordered by San Bernardino County to the northwest and by Orange County to the west, but it never came to fruition.

==Geography and climate==

Corona is located in western Riverside County, east of Orange County.

In early summer, Corona receives common overcast weather known as &quot;May Gray&quot; and &quot;June Gloom&quot;. Summer thunderstorms are sporadic and usually happen between July and September from the North American Monsoons, bringing increased humidity and scattered thunderstorms.

Autumn features warm days and sharply cooler evenings, but can be windy due to the Santa Ana winds, blowing in two or three times a year from October to December.

The east side of N Main St - particularly E Harrison St and E Blaine ST between N Main St and N Joy St - will be converted to a mixed-use community featuring apartments and retail, further making use of the close proximity to Corona - North Main Station.

<text>Desert Hot Springs is a city in Riverside County, California, United States. The city is located within the Coachella Valley geographic region. The population was 32,512 as of the 2020 census, up from 25,938 at the 2010 census. The city has experienced rapid growth since the 1970s when there were 2,700 residents. The city is commonly referred to by its initials, DHS.

It is named for its many natural hot springs. It is one of several places in the world with naturally occurring hot and cold mineral springs. More than 20 natural mineral spring lodgings can be found in town. Unlike hot springs with high sulfur content, the mineral springs in town are odorless.

==History==
The only people residing in areas north of Palm Springs before the 20th century were the Cahuilla Indians in the village of Seven Palms. Although Cahuilla people never settled permanently in today&#x27;s Desert Hot Springs, they often camped here during winter times due to the warm climate.

According to early homesteader and writer Cabot Yerxa in his newspaper columns published in The &quot;Desert Sentinel&quot; newspaper, the first homesteader in the area of the city of Desert Hot Springs was Hilda Maude Gray, who staked her claim in 1908.
Cabot Yerxa arrived in 1913 and soon discovered the hot water aquifer on Miracle Hill. Due to the Mission Creek Branch of the San Andreas Fault bisecting the area, one side is a cold water aquifer, the other has a hot water aquifer. His large Pueblo Revival Style architecture structure, hand built over 20 years, is now one of the oldest adobe-style buildings in Riverside County and houses Cabot&#x27;s Pueblo Museum, designated a state historical site after his death in 1965. Cabot&#x27;s Trading Post &amp; Gallery opened there in February 2008.

The town was founded by L. W. Coffee on July 12, 1941. The original town site was centered at the intersection of Palm Drive and Pierson Boulevard and was only one square mile. Coffee chose the name Desert Hot Springs because of the area&#x27;s natural hot springs.

Desert Hot Springs became a tourist destination in the 1950s because of its small spa hotels and boutique hotels. The city is popular with &quot;snowbirds.&quot; Realtors arrived to speculate, and thousands of lots were laid out over a six-square mile area. Some homes were bought by retirees, and the area was incorporated as a city in 1963, with 1,000 residents.

Desert Hot Springs experienced periods of significant growth in the 1980s and 1990s when most of the vacant lots were filled with new houses and duplex apartments. The city&#x27;s population doubled in the 1980s and increased by 5,000 in the 2000 census.

Desert Hot Springs was the first city in Southern California to legalize medical marijuana cultivation and has since been overwhelmed by marijuana developers and growers. It was later featured in a CNBC special as California&#x27;s first city to permit the commercial cultivation of marijuana in 2014.

==Geography==
Before the development of the city began in the 1930s, Desert Hot Springs was a treeless place in California&#x27;s Colorado Desert.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which 98.73% is land, and 1.27% is water. Desert Hot Springs is nestled between two mountain ranges: San Bernardino Mountains and San Jacinto Mountains. It is located just south of Big Morongo Canyon Preserve and Joshua Tree National Park. It is located in the Colorado Desert region of the Sonoran Desert.

==Climate==
Desert Hot Springs has a desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) similar to the rest of the Coachella Valley, with less than six inches of precipitation per year. Summers are very hot with days frequently exceeding in July and August while night-time lows tend to stay between . The winters are mild with days typically seeing temperatures between and corresponding night-time lows between . Heat waves during the summer months involving temperatures higher than are not unusual.

Summer winds and the higher elevation keep Desert Hot Springs on average 5-7 degrees cooler than other communities in Coachella Valley. However, the winter season can be warmer due to the surrounding mountains blocking north winds. Since it lies at a higher elevation than the cities further south, cold air drains into the lower elevation of the Coachella Valley, which results in warmer night-time lows, producing an example of thermal inversion.

===Geology===
The Mission Creek Fault, a branch of the San Andreas, separates two aquifers. On one side, the Desert Hot Springs Sub-Basin contains an aquifer with hot water. This aquifer supports the area&#x27;s spas and resorts. Mission Springs Sub-basin, on the other side of the fault, the Miracle Creek sub-basin has cold water. This aquifer provides fresh water to the city and has received awards for exceptional taste.

<doc id="107918" wikidata="Q948188" url="?curid=107918" title="Hemet, California">
<text>Hemet is a city in the San Jacinto Valley in Riverside County, California. It covers a total area of , about half of the valley, which it shares with the neighboring city of San Jacinto. The population was 89,833 at the 2020 census. It borders San Jacinto to the north, East Hemet to the east, Polly Butte and Diamond Valley Lake to the south, and Green Acres and Juniper Springs to the west.

The founding of Hemet, initially called South San Jacinto, predates the formation of Riverside County. This area was then still part of San Diego County. The formation of Lake Hemet helped the city to grow and stimulated agriculture in the area.

The city is known for being the home of &quot;The Ramona Pageant&quot;, California&#x27;s official outdoor play, set in the Spanish colonial era. Started in 1923, the play is one of the longest-running outdoor plays in the United States.

Hemet has been named a Tree City USA for 20 years by the Arbor Day Foundation for its dedication to the local forest. The city is home to the Hemet Valley Medical Center, a 320-bed general hospital.

==History==

This had long been the territory of the indigenous Soboba people and Cahuilla tribe prior to Spanish colonization. During the early 19th century, Mission San Luis Rey used the land for cattle ranching. They named the area with the settler name &quot;Rancho San Jacinto&quot;.

===Etymology===

Hemet was named by the land development company that founded the town, &quot;The Lake Hemet Land Company&quot;. The company drew its name from Hemet Valley, now called Garner Valley, located in the San Jacinto Mountains. Initially, the company referred to the area as South San Jacinto, but changed the name to Hemet when the land company filed a plat map on November 11, 1893.

===Mexican period===

Following Mexico gaining independence from Spain, in 1842, settler José Antonio Estudillo received the Rancho San Jacinto Viejo Mexican land grant.

In 1848, the United States annexed the California territory after defeating Mexico in the Mexican–American War. In 1887, during the first major Southern California land boom, Anglo-Americans W.F. Whittier and E.L. Mayberry founded the Lake Hemet Water Company, and the Lake Hemet Land Company, for speculative development. They had plans to dam the San Jacinto River to provide irrigation water to the valley. They named the town Hemet in November 1893.

In 1895, they completed Hemet Dam as a private project on the San Jacinto River, creating Lake Hemet and providing a reliable water supply to the San Jacinto Valley. This water system, for irrigation in an arid region, was integral to the valley&#x27;s development as an agricultural area.

By 1894, settlers had established a newspaper, the &quot;Hemet News&quot;, and &quot;several general stores&quot;, the largest being Heffelfinger &amp; Co, which occupied an entire block. Other businesses included &quot;a drug store, an excellent barber shop, two blacksmith shops, harness shop, shoe repairing houses, two real estate offices and two lumber yards.&quot; &quot;The most pretentious building&quot; was the two-story Hotel Mayberry, &quot;supplied with all the modern conveniences usually found in first-class hostelries, including stationary water, baths, etc., and a complete electric light system, the power for which is furnished by the company&#x27;s private plant.&quot; Also noted was the Hemet flour mill, owned by John McCool and built at a cost of $20,000. It was the only such mill in this area, and was housed in a brick building. It could produce 50 barrels of flour per day.

===Incorporation===

Hemet was incorporated in January 1910. Of 177 residents, 130 voted to incorporate, with 33 against. Those who voted against incorporation were landowners who feared increased taxation. The incorporation helped to serve the growing city, which was outgrowing its current infrastructure.

With a railroad spur running from Riverside, the city became a trading center for San Jacinto Valley agriculture; commodity crops included citrus, apricots, peaches, olives, and walnuts. The Agricultural District Farmer&#x27;s Fair of Riverside County began here in 1936 as the Hemet Turkey Show. It was relocated to Perris.

During World War II, the city hosted the Ryan School of Aeronautics, which trained about 6,000 fliers for the Army Air Force between 1940 and 1944. The site of the flight school was redeveloped as Hemet-Ryan Airport. In 1950, Hemet was home to 10,000 people, joining Corona and Riverside as the three largest cities in Riverside County.

Hemet was racially discriminatory. Numerous African Americans migrated to California during and after World War II in the Great Migration from such Deep South states as Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. Hemet was a sundown town, prohibiting African Americans from living there or even staying overnight.

In the 1960s, large-scale residential development began, mostly in the form of mobile home parks and retirement communities. Hemet was known as a working-class retirement area. In the 1980s, former ranchland was developed in subdivisions of single-family homes. &quot;Big-box&quot; retail followed the increase in population. After a roughly decade-long lull in development following the major economic downturn of the early 1990s, housing starts in the city skyrocketed in the early 21st century. The area&#x27;s affordability, its proximity to employment centers such as Corona, Riverside and San Bernardino, and its relatively rural character made it an attractive location for working-class families priced out of other areas of Southern California.
==Geography==
Hemet is in the San Jacinto Valley of western Riverside County, south of San Jacinto. The valley, surrounded by the Santa Rosa Hills and San Jacinto Mountains, is mostly dry land, except for Diamond Valley Lake to the south. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Hemet is southeast of Downtown Los Angeles.

===Climate===

===Entertainment===
The city of Hemet is expanding upon its entertainment venues. The three largest venues are the Ramona Bowl, an outdoor amphitheater, a Regal Cinemas and the Historic Hemet Theatre, built in 1921. A development being planned for the area is a downtown transit village, with the center of it being a Metrolink station. It will be north of the downtown core, and will consist of residences, shops, and parks. The station itself could feature a railroad museum, a heritage trail, and a farmer&#x27;s market and market hall.

The Historic Hemet Theater was once the oldest continually run single-screen theater in the nation. However, the theater was forced to close down in January 2010 due to water damage from a fire that destroyed adjacent store fronts. The musty smell forced the theater to stay closed for a year, which created financial struggles. , the foundation was incorporated as a non-profit 501(c)3 for the purpose of supporting community projects. In July 2013, the Historic Hemet Theater Foundation negotiated a five-year lease/option to purchase the theater. As of 2016, the Foundation had restored the Theater back to operation and was in the process of raising funds in order to purchase and restore the Hemet Historical Treasure.

Scenes for &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; (2001) were filmed on Domenigoni Parkway. The grandstands and track at the Hemet Stock Farm were a filming location for the movie &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; (2003). The movie &quot;Hemet, or the Landlady Don&#x27;t Drink Tea&quot; (2023) was filmed in San Diego County, but the location setting is in Hemet.

==Education==
The educational services of the majority of the city are under the Hemet Unified School District. It covers most of Hemet, and parts of San Jacinto, and Valle Vista, with a student population of over 20,000 students. There are also HUSD member schools in the rural communities of Anza, Idyllwild and Winchester.

As of January 2010, the school district was facing having to possibly go far out of budget to fix the Historic Hemet Elementary school, due to the fact that it was built on top of a swamp and has been sinking deeper every year. The main building was built in 1927, and is one of the few historic landmarks left in Hemet. The other choice would be to demolish the school and build a new one in its place. The State of California will pay for 50% of either project, but the already cash-strapped district may run into trouble if the repairing of the school goes over budget. A new building could cost $20 million, with an extra $3 million to have it built in the original architectural style of the old building.

A portion of Hemet is in the San Jacinto Unified School District.

==Library==

The City of Hemet public library was created in 1906. Members of the Women&#x27;s Club opened a reading room at the corner of Harvard Street and Florida Avenue.

In 1910, citizens of the newly formed city voted for its own library, and the city took over the operation of the facility built in 1906. Shortly after, the reading room became too small for the growing community, and groups and citizens lobbied for a newer, larger facility to house the growing collection of books. A woman of the community named Mrs. E.A. Davis was the one who wrote to Andrew Carnegie seeking funds to help build a new library. The city received $7,500 to fund part of the construction, and Mr. and Mrs. St. John donated land to the city to build the new Carnegie Library. The new library was finished in 1913, and served the city for 52 years. The building was declared unsafe by the Fire Marshall and razed in 1969, and the new C.B. Covell Memorial Library was built. This building however, also became too small for the city.

The library moved again in 2003, to its current facility, relocated for the first time since 1913. The new facility is now located at 300 E. Latham Avenue, just blocks from its former location. The new building is two stories tall, and contains . It was designed by John Loomis of 30th Street Architects at a cost of over $15 million.

<text>Highgrove is a census-designated place (CDP) and an unincorporated community in Riverside County, California, United States. The population was 3,988 at the 2010 census, up from 3,445 at the 2000 census. The latest 2020 census shows 7,515 total population, an 88.4% increase from last 2010 census, which makes it the fastest-growing location in entire Riverside County. The city of Riverside, California has plans to annex Highgrove in the near future.

==History==
Highgrove was founded in 1886, originally called East Riverside, but in 1897 during a naming contest, it was renamed to Highgrove, after not getting it confused with the city of Riverside. Citrus-farm growers have occupied Highgrove area since beginning of history, with its superior fresh-wind conditions from the west, blowing into east of a cove-shape like terrain, making it one the most valuable places in the Inland Empire for citrus-farming by generations of farmers. Due to the stronger wind conditions that can easily move air out, a landfill dumping ground was opened in 1947 for discarded farm waste. Originally, it operated as a fire-burn dump during the 1950s, until 1960 when there was a concern of heavy-smog in southern California.

In 1970, the Highgrove Agricultural Preserve conservation was formed in order to support the growing number of orange trees from farmers. More diverse of citrus fruits were being grown for the packing houses in Riverside. However, farming output could only peaked by the mid-1980s. More competition on fruit prices had increased daily from new farming businesses in the Central California region. Highgrove&#x27;s another biggest threat was its rising land-value and water cost for the groves by the end of 1980s, due to its close-proximity to downtown Riverside, which made farm crops more unprofitable. By 1990, the preserve contract was not renewed, citing increases of population density, housing shortage, traffic jam, university students commuting to campus, and smog near the city of Riverside. Citrus (mostly orange) trees were gradually phased out and torn down completely by the year 2000.

The Highgrove sanitary landfill closed permanently in 1998, after 51 years of operation. Since the 2018 inspection yearly report, no methane output has been detected in any of the designated area. Today, new construction homes occupy near front of it, across Pigeon Pass Road, on the former Highgrove Agricultural Preserve land. The citrus industry declined in the area as more agricultural areas were replaced by new subdivisions. In 2007, Spring Mountain Ranch master-planned community was originally conceived by RWR Homes, but construction halted due to the 2008 recession, and now KB Home, in 2014, will be completing this long-awaited project today, with no HOA fee as its main selling point. Other builders included are D.R. Horton, Lennar, and PulteGroup with some HOA fee.

Today, Highgrove is seeing a transformation with over 2,500 new single-family homes and 846 new townhomes proposed at the eastside, at the once former Highgrove Agricultural Preserve that was officially diminished by 2008. In addition, a new K-8 school or magnet high school is planned. The new housing units are currently the only ones available near the University of California, Riverside campus and downtown Riverside.

<text>Idyllwild, Pine Cove, and Fern Valley are three adjacent unincorporated communities in the San Jacinto Mountains in Riverside County, California, United States. Idyllwild has the largest population of the three. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Idyllwild–Pine Cove as a census-designated place (CDP). The CDP&#x27;s population was 3,874 at the 2010 census, up from 3,504 as of the 2000 census.

Idyllwild is adjacent to the Pacific Crest Trail.

&quot;Mile-high Idyllwild&quot; is a mountain resort about in altitude. Idyllwild is flanked by two large rock formations, Tahquitz Peak and Suicide Rock, which are famous in Southern California rock-climbing circles. It offers no skiing, so &quot;the Hill&quot; has been minimally developed over the years and remains a center for hiking, mountain and rock climbing, mountain biking, and horseback riding.

==History==
Idyllwild was once the summer home for bands of Cahuilla Indians, who migrated there to escape the heat of lower-elevation deserts. The Cahuilla&#x27;s grinding slabs can still be seen in Idyllwild.

Idyllwild was originally known as Strawberry Valley because of the wild strawberries that grow there, especially beside the creek that runs through the town, Strawberry Creek. Shepherds regularly brought their flocks to the valley. In the 1880s, the Domenigoni family of San Jacinto homesteaded land near what is now Idyllwild Arts Academy. In 1889, George and Sarah Hannahs built a summer camp next to their sawmill in upper Dutch Flat and named it Camp Idyllwilde. By the 1890s a toll road had been built from Hemet, which opened Idyllwild to settlement, logging, and tourism. A post office was established in 1893; at this time, the town was called Rayneta after the Hannahs&#x27; son Raymond.

In 1901, the Idyllwild Sanatorium was built to treat tuberculosis patients. It was soon remodeled as a resort called Idyllwild Among the Pines, and later Idyllwild. The same year, the town&#x27;s name was changed to Idyllwild.

The Tribe of Tahquitz Boy Scout honor society was created in Idyllwild in 1925.

With the advent of the automobile, Idyllwild became a weekend tourist attraction for Southern Californians. For many years, the town presented itself as an alpine village, and hotels and businesses had German or German-sounding names, but this practice ended during World War II.

From the 1930s to the 1950s, Idyllwild was a center for the production of &quot;knotty pine furniture&quot;, the fine log furniture made in the Arts and Crafts style. Under Charles &quot;Selden&quot; Belden&#x27;s direction, the furniture was produced by the Idyllwild Pinecraft Furniture Company and, later, C. Selden Belden Idyllwild Pinecraft. The furniture is now &quot;collectible&quot; and can be found in many Idyllwild houses and cabins.

In the 1950s, the Yosemite Decimal System of grading routes was developed at Tahquitz by members of the Rock Climbing Section of the Angeles Chapter of the Sierra Club. In 1957 architect Frank Gehry designed and constructed his first private residence. Built along with USC classmate/architect Greg Walsh, the David Cabin shows early inspirational Asian influences and characteristics of Gehry&#x27;s later works, including unfinished ceiling beams and other exposed materials. It is on Middle Ridge Drive.

In the late 1960s and 1970s, there was an influx of hippies to Idyllwild that changed the town and alarmed many longtime residents. Timothy Leary lived on a ranch in nearby Garner Valley, with the ranch serving as the headquarters of The Brotherhood of Eternal Love. In 2019 YouTube celebrity Logan Paul bought the ranch.

From 1974 to 1979, Idyllwild hosted the Idyllwild Bluegrass Invitational, then Southern California&#x27;s only bluegrass music festival (it was inspired by the Julian Banjo-Fiddle Contest, which takes place on the third weekend in September). From the 1950s through the 1970s Idyllwild also hosted the Bear Flag Festival, which honored California&#x27;s Bear Flag and marked the passing of the grizzly bear from California, the last of which, according to local legend, was killed at Hurkey Creek in Garner Valley.

Most high school-age students in Idyllwild attend school in Hemet, which requires them to travel by school bus some in distance and in altitude to and from school. Since the 1950s, some Idyllwild parents have advocated for a high school in the town. There have been many attempts at establishing high schools, but most were short-lived. Startup schools that failed included Hi-Lo, or LIFE (Living in Free Education, a public school where Idyllwild Arts Academy now stands, operated by Mary Glavin in 1973–76), New Schole Ranch (a private school in Mountain Center), and Freedom Schools, Inc. (a private school operated in Mountain Center by Mary Ellen DuBay). Desert Sun School (later called the Elliott-Pope School), a private boarding school that accepted boarders and day students, closed in December 1990, due to financial mischief, after operating for 65 years.

Idyllwild, Garner Valley and Lake Hemet have been used for filming since the silent film era. Although most of Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Squaw Man&quot; (1914) was filmed in the Los Angeles vicinity, footage of cattle on the open range were shot at the &quot;H.J.&quot; Ranch at Keen Camp, midway between Idyllwild and Garner Valley. A number of Westerns have been filmed at the Garner Ranch in Garner Valley: &quot;Guns and Guitars&quot; (1936), &quot;Heading for the Rio Grande&quot; (1936), &quot;Springtime in the Rockies&quot; (1937), &quot;Brothers in the Saddle&quot; (1949), &quot;Riders of the Range&quot; (1949), and &quot;Storm over Wyoming&quot; (1950). The Garner Ranch also stood in for the Ponderosa in episodes of the TV show &quot;Bonanza&quot;. In 1961 and 1962, the Elvis Presley musical &quot;Kid Galahad&quot; was filmed in the Idyllwild vicinity. The 1980s television series &quot;Air Wolf&quot; and various car commercials were also filmed in the area. The biker funeral procession from the 1966 film &quot;The Wild Angels&quot; was filmed in Idyllwild and included the Silver Pines Lodge, which was named Hillbilly Lodge at the time of filming. Some of Steven Suptic&#x27;s &quot;Sugar Pine 7&quot;, a YouTube comedy series, takes place in Idyllwild.

In 2012, a Golden Retriever named Max was elected as the &quot;Mayor&quot; of Idyllwild (which, as part of an unincorporated community, has no local government) out of a running of fourteen dogs and two cats as part of a fundraising event held by and for the non-profit organization Idyllwild Animal Rescue Friends (ARF). In 2013, Mayor Max died, and Maximus Mighty-Dog Mueller II, another Golden Retriever, arrived in Idyllwild to complete the remainder of the term. In March 2014, as the end of Max&#x27;s term approached, Idyllwild Animal Rescue Friends surveyed the people of Idyllwild, inquiring for their interest in another election. The response was widespread and consistent: they wanted Mayor Max for life. No other elections were held and the Mayor Maxes have assumed the positions. Mayor Max II died on July 30, 2022, after a brief medical issue, and was succeeded by Mayor Max III.

<text>Indian Wells is a city in Riverside County, California, United States, in the Coachella Valley. Incorporated in 1967, it lies in between the cities of Palm Desert and La Quinta. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 4,757.

The city hosts the sixth-largest tennis tournament in the world, the Indian Wells Masters tennis tournament, presently known as the BNP Paribas Open. The Indian Wells Masters is one of nine ATP World Tour Masters 1000 high-level events operated by the Association of Tennis Professionals, and one of the four WTA Premier Mandatory tournaments of the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association. It is held at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden, which contains the second-largest tennis-specific stadium in the world.

==History==
The city derived its name from a historic Cahuilla Native American water reservoir, which served as a crucial water supply for nearby tribes.

As early as 1820, the area now known as Indian Wells was the site of a thriving Indian village, as reported by W.P. Blade, a Smithsonian Institution geologist. A decade later, when gold was discovered on the Colorado River, William D. Bradshaw built a trail from Los Angeles through the desert to the gold mines. The Alexander and Company Stage Line used the trail to transport prospectors and Indian Wells became an important stop along the trail. Competition from the Southern Pacific Railroad caused the route to be abandoned briefly in 1875 before being reactivated by the Wells Fargo company the following year.

Over the next decades, settlers gradually arrived in the area and date palm ranches became profitable. The area&#x27;s first golf courses were opened in the 1950s at the Eldorado Country Club and the Indian Wells Country Club. In 1957, Desi Arnaz opened his Indian Wells Hotel (forerunner to the Indian Wells Resort Hotel). In 1960, Arnold Palmer won the first Bob Hope Desert Classic golf tournament. President Dwight D. Eisenhower was a regular Indian Wells visitor and later an Eldorado homeowner.

In an election held June 27, 1967, to avoid being annexed by neighboring cities such as Palm Desert, the inhabitants of Indian Wells voted to incorporate as a city. On July 14, 1967, Indian Wells became California&#x27;s 400th city and the 16th in Riverside County. Since then, Indian Wells has continued to grow, with the development of resort hotels, golf courses and luxury residential areas.
