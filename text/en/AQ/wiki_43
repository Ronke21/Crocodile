<text>Cedar Key is a city in Levy County, Florida, United States. As of the 2020 census, its population was 687, down from 702 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Gainesville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The Cedar Keys are a cluster of islands near the mainland. Most of the developed area for the City of Cedar Key has been on Way Key since the end of the 19th century. The Cedar Keys are named for the eastern red cedar &quot;Juniperus virginiana&quot;, once abundant in the area.

The city has recovered from Hurricane Helene on September 26, 2024, which caused a 10-foot storm surge that broke the record set during Hurricane Idalia in August 2023.

==History==

===Early===
While evidence suggests human occupation as far back as 500 BC, the first maps of the area date to 1542, when a cartographer from Spain labeled it &quot;Las Islas Sabines&quot; (which means &quot;The Cedar Islands&quot; in Spanish). An archaeological dig at Shell Mound, north of Cedar Key, found artifacts dating back to 500 BC in the top of the mound. The only ancient burial found in Cedar Key was a 2,000-year-old skeleton found in 1999. Arrow heads and spear points dating from the Paleo period (12,000 years old) were collected by Cedar Key historian St. Clair Whitman, and are displayed at the Cedar Key Museum State Park.

Followers of William Augustus Bowles, self-declared &quot;Director General of the State of Muskogee&quot;, built a watchtower in the vicinity of Cedar Key in 1801. The tower was destroyed by a Spanish force in 1802. In the period leading up to the First Seminole War, the British subjects Alexander Arbuthnot and Robert Ambrister used the Cedar Keys to deliver supplies to the Seminoles. The Cedar Keys may have been a refuge for escaped slaves in the early 1820s, and an entry point for the illegal slave trade later that decade.

===Indian War===
During the Second Seminole War, the United States Army established Fort No. 4 on the mainland adjacent to the Cedar Keys. (The name &quot;No. 4&quot; was later applied to a boat channel next to the fort, and then to a railroad trestle and a highway bridge over that channel.) In 1840, General Zachary Taylor requested the Cedar Keys be reserved for military use for the duration of the war, and that Seahorse Key be permanently reserved for a lighthouse. In 1840, General Walker Keith Armistead, who had succeeded Zachary Taylor as commander of United States troops in the war, ordered construction of a hospital on what had become known as Depot Key. (The island&#x27;s name may reflect the establishment of a depot there by Florida militia general Leigh Read. The primary depot for the U.S. Army in Florida at the time was at Palatka, Florida.) Depot Key was the headquarters for the Army in Florida, but Fishburne states headquarters was not in a fixed place, but wherever the commander was.

Cantonment Morgan was established on nearby Seahorse Key by 1841 and used as a troop deployment station and as a holding station for Seminoles who had been captured or who had surrendered until they could be sent to the West. A hurricane with a storm surge struck the Cedar Keys on October 4, 1842, destroying Cantonment Morgan and causing much damage on Depot Key. Some Seminole leaders had been meeting with Army officers at Depot Key to negotiate their surrender or a retreat to a reservation in the Everglades. After the hurricane, the Seminoles refused to return to the area. Colonel William J. Worth had declared the war to be over in August 1842, and Depot Key was abandoned by the Army after the hurricane.

===Pre-Civil War===

In 1842, the United States Congress had enacted the Armed Occupation Act, a precursor of the Homestead Act, to increase white settlement in Florida as a way to force the Seminoles to leave the territory. With the abandonment of the Army base on Depot Key, the Cedar Keys became available for settlement under the act. Under the terms of the act, several people received permits for settlement on Depot Key, Way Key, and Scale Key. Augustus Steele, US Customs House Officer for Hillsborough County, Florida, and postmaster for the Tampa Bay area, received the permit for Depot Key, which he renamed Atsena Otie Key. In 1843, he bought the buildings on the island, and built some cottages for wealthy guests. In 1844, he became the Collector of Customs for the port of Cedar Key, as well as for Tampa, Florida. A post office named &quot;Cedar Key&quot; was established on Atsena Otie Key in 1845. The Florida legislature chartered the &quot;City of Atsena Otie&quot; in 1859.

Cedar Key became an important port, shipping lumber and naval stores harvested on the mainland. By 1860, two mills on Atsena Otie Key were producing &quot;cedar&quot; slats for shipment to northern pencil factories. As a result of the growth, the US Congress appropriated funds for a lighthouse on Seahorse Key in 1850. The Cedar Key Light was completed in 1854. The lighthouse lantern is above the ground, but the lighthouse sits on a hill, putting the light above sea level. The light was visible for . Wood-frame residences were added to each side of the lighthouse several years later.

In 1860, Cedar Key became the western terminus of the Florida Railroad, connecting it to Fernandina Beach, Florida on the east coast of Florida. David Levy Yulee, U.S. senator and president of the Florida Railroad, had acquired most of Way Key to house the railroad&#x27;s terminal facilities. A town was platted on Way Key in 1859, and Parsons and Hale&#x27;s General Store, which is now the Island Hotel, was built there in the same year. On March 1, 1861, the first train arrived in Cedar Key, just weeks before the Civil War began.

===Civil War era===
With the advent of the American Civil War in 1861, Confederate agents extinguished the light at Seahorse Key and removed its supply of sperm whale oil. The defense of Cedar Key was assigned to the Columbia and New River Rifles, two companies of the 4th Florida Infantry Regiment, under the command of Lt. Colonel M. Whit Smith. On July 3, 1861, four Federal war prize schooners appeared off Cedar Key. The schooners, originally captured by the USS Massachusetts off New Orleans, were under the command of U. S. Navy Lieutenant George L. Selden, nephew of former Treasurer of the United States William Selden, and manned by nineteen sailors. Col. Smith led his two rifle companies along with one six-pounder cannon twenty miles offshore on the steamer Madison and captured the schooners after firing two warning shots. With the recovery, Col. Smith and his men liberated fifteen Confederate sailors, recovered the vessels&#x27; valuable cargo of railroad iron and turpentine and effected the first capture of a U. S. Naval officer at sea during the war.

The USS &quot;Hatteras&quot; raided Cedar Key in January 1862, burning several ships loaded with cotton and turpentine and destroying the railroad&#x27;s rolling stock and buildings on Way Key. Most of the Confederate troops guarding Cedar Key had been sent to Fernandina in anticipation of a Federal attack there. Cedar Key was an important source of salt for the Confederacy during the early part of the war. In October 1862, a Union raid destroyed sixty kettles on Salt Key capable of producing 150 bushels of salt a day. The Union occupied the Cedar Keys in early 1864, staying for the remainder of the war.

In 1865, the Eberhard Faber mill was built on Atsena Otie Key. The Eagle Pencil Company mill was built on Way Key, and because Way Key had its railroad terminal built there, it surpassed Atsena Otie Key in population. Repairs to the Florida Railroad were completed in 1868, and freight and passenger traffic again flowed into Cedar Key. The &quot;Town of Cedar Keys&quot; was incorporated in 1869, and had a population of 400 in 1870.

Early in his career as a naturalist, John Muir walked from Louisville, Kentucky, to Cedar Key in just two months in 1867. Muir contracted malaria while working in a sawmill in Cedar Key, and recovered in the house of the mill&#x27;s superintendent. Muir recovered enough to sail from Cedar Key to Cuba in January 1868. He recorded his impressions of Cedar Key in his memoir &quot;A Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf&quot;, published in 1916, after his death.
=== Decline and restoration of wildlife ===
When Henry Plant&#x27;s railroad to Tampa began service in 1886, Tampa took shipping away from Cedar Key, causing an economic decline in the area. Earlier, growth in population had led to the Cedar Key town limits being expanded in 1881 and again in 1884. But with the decline in the local economy, the town limits were contracted in 1890. Also in 1890, the island town was affected by the reign of terror of Cedar Keys mayor William Cottrell, who took advantage of his Florida state legislature connections and the restricted one-way road access to impose his will and conduct acts of violence. He was deposed from power only after the island was invaded by a naval (U.S. Coast Guard) boat manned with a squad of U.S. Marshals, who were sent there after Custom House officers and other federal government workers requested federal aid due to being unable to discharge their duties on the islands.
The 1896 Cedar Keys hurricane was the final blow. Around 4 am on September 29, 1896, a storm surge swept over the town, killing more than 100 people. Winds north of town were estimated at , which would classify it as a category 3. The hurricane wiped out the juniper trees still standing and destroyed all the mills. A fire on December 2, 1896, further damaged the town. In following years, structures were rebuilt on Way Key, a more protected island inland, but the damage was done. Today, only a few reminders of the original town on Atsena Otie Key remain, including stone water cisterns, and a graveyard whose headstones conspicuously date prior to 1896. Also, many of the eastern red cedar trees that originally attracted the pencil company, and for which the community was named, are gone.
At the start of the 20th century, fishing, sponge hooking, and oystering had become the major industries, but around 1909, the oyster beds were exhausted. President Herbert Hoover established the Cedar Keys National Wildlife Refuge in 1929 by naming three of the islands as a breeding ground for colonial birds. The lighthouse was abandoned in 1952, just as the tourism industry began to grow as a result of interest in the historic community, but it remains in use as a marine biology research center by the University of Florida in Gainesville.

===Present===

The old-fashioned fishing village is now a tourist center with several regionally famous seafood restaurants. The village holds two festivals a year, the Spring Sidewalk Art Festival and the Fall Seafood Festival, that each attract thousands of visitors to the area.

The municipality was officially incorporated as the &quot;City of Cedar Key&quot; in 1923.

In 1950, Hurricane Easy, a category-3 storm with winds, looped around Cedar Key three times before finally making landfall, dumping of rain and destroying two-thirds of the homes. The storm came ashore at low tide, so the surge was only .

Hurricane Elena followed a similar path in 1985, but did not make landfall. Packing winds, the storm churned for two days in the Gulf, to the west, battering the waterfront. All the businesses and restaurants on Dock Street were either damaged or destroyed, and a section of the seawall collapsed.

After a statewide ban on large-scale net fishing went into effect July 1, 1995, a government retraining program helped many local fishermen begin farming clams in the muddy waters. Today, Cedar Key&#x27;s clam-based aquaculture is a multimillion-dollar industry.

A local museum exhibit displays a reproduction of one of the first air conditioning installations. The system, with compressor and fans, was used in Cedar Key to ease the lot of malaria patients.

Cedar Key is home to the George T. Lewis Airport (CDK).

Hurricane Eta made one of its two landfalls in Florida at about 4 a.m. Thursday, November 10, 2020, near Cedar Key, as a tropical storm.

On August 30, 2023, Hurricane Idalia caused significant damage to Cedar Key as it headed towards Florida&#x27;s Big Bend. Although not making a direct hit on the city, the storm brought heavy rains, winds, and storm surge levels that reached a record above high tide.

On the night of September 26, 2024, Hurricane Helene caused significant to major damage to Cedar Key as it headed towards Florida&#x27;s Big Bend. It hit close enough to Cedar Key, to bring major floods, major wind gusts, heavy rain, and storm surge levels that reached a new record above high tide, surpassing Hurricane Idalia&#x27;s storm surge.

===Historic district and museum===
Cedar Key&#x27;s importance in Florida&#x27;s history, which began as far back as 1000 BC with pre-Columbian habitation of the region, was recognized on October 3, 1989, by the federal government. At that time, in and around the town were added to the National Register of Historic Places under the title of the Cedar Keys Historic and Archaeological District.
The Cedar Key Museum State Park depicts the town&#x27;s 19th century history and displays sea shells and Indian artifacts from the collection of Saint Clair Whitman. Tours of Whitman&#x27;s restored 1920s house are available during museum hours. As the museum photo indicates, the building was constructed to withstand the hurricane conditions that the town is subjected to periodically.

The naturalist John Muir visited Cedar Key in 1867 on his historic walk from Kentucky to Florida. He wrote: For nineteen years my vision was bounded by forests, but today, emerging from a multitude of tropical plants, I beheld the Gulf of Mexico stretching away unbounded, except by the sky. What dreams and speculative matter for thought arose as I stood on the strand, gazing out on the burnished, treeless plain! The John Muir historic marker was placed on the museum grounds in 1983, commemorating his visit.

In 1860, it was renamed &quot;Hardeetown&quot;, after Isaac P. Hardee, who was a slaver that owned a large plantation that extended for miles and the community was eventually built on the land. The City of Chiefland was officially incorporated as a municipality in 1913.

<text>Otter Creek is a town in Levy County, Florida, United States. The town is located in North Florida. The population was 108 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Hernando de Soto crossed Otter Creek during his explorations of Florida in 1539.

It was settled in 1856, and the community was called &quot;Otter Creek Ford&quot;.

In the 1930s and 1940s, Otter Creek was the second largest community in Levy County, with a population approaching 1,000.

The loss of a lumber mill that made cypress &quot;flitches&quot; for citrus crates and the discontinuation of two railroads which bisected the town led to a steady population decline.

The Town of Otter Creek was officially incorporated as a municipality in 1969.

In 2007, the town council created a local historic district consisting of neighborhoods with &quot;company town&quot; residences that date from the 19th and early 20th century

After the closure of the lumber mill, there has been very little business or commercial activity within Otter Creek. By 2019, only two small businesses remained, an independently-owned convenience store (no gasoline) located at the intersection of Highways 19 and 24, and the Creekside Christian School, a private, primary school operating on the grounds of Otter Creek Baptist Church.

To the extent that other businesses existed, they have closed due to the deaths of their owners or otherwise failed. Some notable examples were the Smith Store and the Country Store, both community-centric and vibrant in their days. The Smith Store was operated by Ella Graham (deceased 1996), whose grandson once delivered groceries and dry goods to the town residents on a Shetland pony. The Country Store, originally built and operated by Junior and Philene Williams, changed hands after their deaths, but permanently closed about 2000. There was an animal hide tannery until about 1980, and a few bait shops and convenience stores. The remnants of nearly all are now decrepit.

==Geography==
The approximate coordinates for the Town of Otter Creek is located at .

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (1.28%) is water.

==Climate==
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild winters. According to the Köppen climate classification, the Town of Otter Creek has a humid subtropical climate zone (&quot;Cfa&quot;).

<doc id="109370" wikidata="Q988100" url="?curid=109370" title="Wallingford, Oxfordshire">
<text>Wallingford () is a historic market town and civil parish on the River Thames in South Oxfordshire, England, north of Reading, south of Oxford and north west of Henley-on-Thames. Although belonging to the historic county of Berkshire, it is within the ceremonial county of Oxfordshire for administrative purposes (since 1974) as a result of the 1972 Local Government Act. The population was 11,600 at the 2011 census.

The town has played an important role in English history starting with the surrender of Stigand to William the Conqueror in 1066, which led to his taking the throne and the creation of Wallingford Castle. The castle and the town enjoyed royal status and flourished for much of the Middle Ages. The Treaty of Wallingford, which ended a civil war known as The Anarchy between King Stephen and Empress Matilda, was signed there. The town then entered a period of decline after the arrival of the Black Death and falling out of favour with the Tudor monarchs before being called on once again during the English Civil War. Wallingford held out as the last remaining Royalist stronghold in Berkshire before surrendering after a 16-week siege. Fearing that Wallingford Castle could be used in a future uprising, Oliver Cromwell ordered its destruction.

Since then Wallingford has become a market town and centre of local commerce. At the centre of the town is a market square with the war memorial and Wallingford Town Hall to the south, the Corn Exchange theatre to the east and numerous shops around the edges. Off the square there are alleyways and streets with more shops and a number of historic inns. Although it was a small town, Wallingford once had 14 churches; now, there are three ancient churches within the Parish of St Mary-le-More and St Leonard, a modern Roman Catholic church, a Quaker Meeting House dating from 1724 and Baptist, Methodist and community churches.

==Etymology==
The place-name first appears as &quot;Wælingford&quot; in a Saxon charter of 821, as &quot;Welingaford&quot; around 891 and as &quot;Walingeford&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086. A number of etymologies have been proposed and the name has been the subject of debate for centuries.

Both William Camden and Samuel Lewis state that the modern English name ultimately derives from a preexisting Brythonic name for the site. Camden gives this name as &quot;Gual Hen&quot;, with Lewis giving &quot;Guallen&quot;, with sound changes meaning the word became &quot;Walling&quot; in Old English with the element &quot;ford&quot; being suffixed at a later time. If either derivation is correct, the modern English name would mean &quot;ford at the old fortification&quot;. Eilert Ekwall and John Richard Green derive Wallingford as the ford of &quot;Wealh&#x27;s or Walhaz people&quot;, meaning &quot;Ford of the Welsh people&quot; (British speaking Celts).

==History==
=== Early history ===

Wallingford developed around an important crossing point of the River Thames. There is evidence of Roman activity in the area who have left traces of occupation, burials, roads, coins and pottery. The Anglo-Saxons built the first settlement. Wallingford has been fortified since the Anglo-Saxon period when it was an important fortified borough of Wessex with the right to mint royal coinage. It was enclosed with substantial earthworks by King Alfred the Great in the ninth century as part of a network of fortified towns known as burhs, or burghs, to protect Wessex against the Vikings. These defences can still be clearly discerned as a group of four roughly square areas around the centre of the town and are well-preserved. Wallingford became the chief town of Berkshire and the seat of the county&#x27;s Ealdorman.

=== Medieval period ===
During the Norman Conquest in 1066, the Anglo-Saxon lord Wigod allowed William the Conqueror&#x27;s invading armies into Wallingford to rest and to cross the Thames unopposed. It was in Wallingford that Stigand the Archbishopric of Canterbury surrendered and submitted to William, thereby all but ending opposition to William&#x27;s ascent to the throne. From Wallingford, William with Stigand and his armies rode east to Berkhamsted, where he received the final surrender from Edgar and the rest of the English leadership before marching on London for his coronation on Christmas Day. At that time, the river at Wallingford was the lowest point at which the river could be forded. The town subsequently stood in high favour with the Normans as Wallingford Castle was built soon afterward on the orders of William, and became a key strategic centre controlling the Thames crossing and surrounding area. The Domesday Book of 1086 lists Wallingford as one of only 18 towns in the kingdom with a population of over 2,000 people.

==== Establishment of Wallingford Priory (1097) ====
Wallingford Priory, also known as Holy Trinity Priory, is believed to have stood on the site of the Bull Croft recreation ground off the High Street. This Benedictine priory was established on land granted to St Albans Abbey in 1097 by Henry I, and Geoffrey the Chamberlain gave the priory to St Albans Paul, 14th Abbot of St Albans, who sent some of his monks to establish a cell there. Wallingford Priory produced the mathematician Richard of Wallingford and the chronicler John of Wallingford.

==== The Anarchy and King John (12th century) ====
Wallingford provided refuge for the Empress Matilda&#x27;s party during the civil war that began after her father Henry I&#x27;s death. After the fall of Oxford Castle to Stephen in 1141, Matilda fled to Wallingford, according to some historic accounts in the snow under a moonlit sky. Wallingford Castle was besieged unsuccessfully a number of times, with the Treaty of Wallingford ending the conflict there in November 1153.

The town was granted a Royal Charter in 1155 by the new king, Henry II, being the second town in England to receive one.

During Prince John&#x27;s unsuccessful revolt against his brother King Richard I whilst Richard was involved with the Third Crusade, John seized Wallingford Castle in 1189. The rebellion failed, and John was forced to return the castle to the king&#x27;s administrators. King John reclaimed the castle after his inheriting the crown in 1199. John modernised, fortified and greatly enlarged the Castle and used it extensively during the First Barons&#x27; War.

==== Decline (13th–15th centuries) ====
The town declined in importance from the mid-13th century, when its size and population reduced. The town received a further blow when plague arrived in 1343. It severely damaged the town and its population; the number of churches declined from eleven (during the reign of King Henry II) to only four by the 15th century. The castle declined subsequently, much stone being removed to renovate Windsor Castle.

The road from London to Gloucestershire passed through Wallingford, and the town flourished as a trading centre throughout most of the Middle Ages. The road was diverted, and a bridge was constructed at Abingdon. The opening of Abingdon Bridge and loss of traffic that the road had brought caused the town to enter a steep economic decline.

==== Catherine of Valois and Owen Tudor (1422) ====

In 1422 Wallingford and its castle was granted to Catherine of Valois, widowed Queen of Henry V. Catherine lived at Wallingford with her son Henry VI, who was tutored there. While she lived at Wallingford, Catherine met Owen Tudor, whom she later married in secret. Catherine and Owen&#x27;s eldest son Edmund Tudor fathered Henry VII who defeated Richard III at Bosworth Field and founded the Tudor Dynasty.

=== The Tudor dynasty (1485–1603) ===
One of the last documented uses of Wallingford as a royal residence was during 1518. Letters between Cardinal Wolsey and his secretary Richard Pace discuss King Henry VIII&#x27;s dissatisfaction with Wallingford and his desire to move on. The priory was dissolved in 1525 by Cardinal Wolsey, partly in order to fund the building of the Cardinal College in Oxford. Henry VIII separated the Honour of Wallingford, which included rights of control over the town and its castle, from the Duchy of Cornwall in 1540.

He combined it with the Honour of Ewelme, which included the rights over his existing residence and lands at Ewelme. Ewelme is two miles from Wallingford, so this was done to consolidate control in the area. In return Henry transferred as compensation several areas of Cornish property into the Duchy of Cornwall for Prince Edward. After taking control of Wallingford in 1540, King Henry VIII did not favour choosing Wallingford Castle as an official residence. Instead, he opted to transfer materials from it to Windsor to enlarge &amp; improve his own castle there. This practice of dismantling Wallingford Castle to improve Windsor Castle was continued in the reigns of Edward VI, Mary I &amp; Elizabeth I.

=== English Civil War and aftermath ===
Maintenance and repair of Wallingford Castle during the English Civil War was vital to the success of the Royalists&#x27; plans. The royal headquarters were in Oxford, which made the defence of Wallingford, which controlled the area to the south, especially strategically important. In August 1643 Colonel Blagge was granted warrants from the King and Prince Rupert to collect taxes from Reading and other local towns in order to proceed with the repairs. In April 1643 the king marched south from Wallingford in order to relieve Reading, which was besieged by the Earl of Essex. The Parliamentary army was 16,000 strong and laid siege to Reading using cannons. Reading was unable to hold out long enough for the King and Prince Rupert to arrive and break the siege. The town surrendered on 27 April 1643, with &quot;the garrison joining the royal army and together they retreated through Wallingford back to Oxford&quot;.

In 1643 a group of Parliamentary commissioners came to Wallingford in search of an audience with the King. Blagge received them, with the encounter being recorded as &quot;worrying&quot;. &quot;He received them, &#x27;not rudely, but with haughtiness enough,&#x27; sending a troop of horse to escort them as if they had been prisoners. High words followed; the commissioners feared they might have had their throats cut by the garrison and gladly took their leave of the &#x27;proud governour.&quot; 4 October 1643 was the last time the king and queen visited the town together, although they did visit Abingdon, staying at Barton Lodge on 17 April 1644. It was also the last time that any British king and queen stayed at the castle together, owing to its destruction at the end of the war. By May 1644 the war had turned decidedly against the Royalists in Berkshire, and a failure of communications among the commanders left Abingdon open to occupation by the Parliamentarians. General Waller took the town and the garrison retreated to Wallingford.

After the Second Battle of Newbury on 27 October 1644, where neither side had gained a true victory, King Charles I retreated through Wallingford on his way to Oxford. Although his retreat went initially unchallenged, the next day at a meeting of the War Council it was resolved that Cromwell, Balfour and Sir Arthur Hesilrige were to be allowed to take cavalry to pursue the King. They were too late, and by the time they reached Wallingford, they found the Royalists had already advanced to Oxford, with the castle blocking their path. It was annoyance at missing an opportunity to capture the king that led to Cromwell forming his New Model Army.

==== Siege of Wallingford ====

The first assault on the town was led by Colonel Baxter, the governor of Reading in 1645. However, finding that the fortifications exceeded his expectations, he retreated quickly to Reading. By the end of 1645 the situation had worsened, with the king&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Naseby by General Fairfax. By this point Wallingford, Faringdon and Donnington were the only strongholds still loyal to the king in the county of Berkshire. The king held up at Oxford for the winter, with the intention of riding south to relieve and retake positions in Berkshire, but the failure of reinforcements to arrive from the west and the imminent threat of siege by General Fairfax forced him to flee north. The siege of Wallingford was begun on 4 May 1646 by General Fairfax; the Parliamentarians laid siege to Oxford on 11 May.

Oxford held out until 24 June, when the garrison of 3,000 men including the king&#x27;s nephews, Prince Rupert and Prince Maurice, were marched out of the city with full honours. Now only Wallingford remained, its garrison faithfully holding the town and castle for the king under the leadership of Colonel Blagge. However, his position was now impossible to hold, with the town being blockaded on all sides. It was only a matter of time, but still Blagge held that he would not surrender without the king&#x27;s order and even threatened to set fire to the town during a full assault.

A Parliamentary special council met and decided that the difficulty of any full assault would cause unacceptable losses. Waiting and trying to starve Blagge out would give the king time to build his forces. They were also very concerned that they were risking making a martyr of the town to the Royalist cause in Berkshire if the townspeople suffered too much, either in a prolonged siege or an assault. The council resolved to draw up preferential terms for Wallingford&#x27;s surrender. Initially, Blagge refused even these with the same answer that he would need the king&#x27;s consent to surrender the town. However, by July, with the king&#x27;s surrender to the Scotch Army and Wallingford now being the only stronghold in Berkshire still loyal to the crown, he knew that there would be no relief or reinforcements.

The blockade had over time also been tightened, and with the prospect of desertion and mutiny from his starving soldiers, Blagge was forced to reopen negotiations. The terms of Blagge&#x27;s surrender were drawn up on 22 July 1646. General Fairfax respected Blagge as a fellow soldier for his work in resurrecting the castle for the war, and for the manner in which he chose to hold for as long as possible instead of surrendering. Fairfax therefore still granted Blagge the original favourable terms of surrender he was offered, even though the situation had changed. The surrender stipulated that the town and its castle would be surrendered to General Fairfax on 29 July and that all of the town&#x27;s arms, ordinance and provisions of war would be handed over to Fairfax.

Blagge and his garrison would then be allowed to march out of the town with full honours, and allowed to leave with their horses, arms and baggage. They would then be permitted to march ten miles out of the town before disbanding. Blagge was, however, forced in the end to surrender the castle to General Fairfax early on the 27th after a mutiny broke out within the garrison. Fairfax sent a regiment into the town to restore order, and the garrison&#x27;s exit was made unimpeded. Only two castles now remained supporting the royalist cause, Raglan and Pendennis, and they both fell by August. A new governor, Evelyn, was installed, although he petitioned for the immediate destruction of the castle. Parliament instead decided to use it for the imprisonment of Presbyterian prisoners after the Prides Purge.

==== Slighting of the castle ====
Continued turmoil, unrest in the country and a fear that the residents of Wallingford were still loyal to the crown caused Oliver Cromwell to fear that Wallingford Castle could again be fortified against him in a future uprising. On 17 November 1652, the Council of State decided that Wallingford Castle should be &quot;forthwith demolished and the workes thereto belonging effectually slighted.&quot; Materials from the castle were used again for improvement works at Windsor Castle and for the repair and improvement of the church of St Mary-le-More.

=== Georgian period ===

Sir William Blackstone, a famous English jurist, judge and Tory politician lived in Wallingford and held the office of Recorder of the town. The Blackstone family owned an estate in and around Wallingford, and William, upon inheriting it, built a house called Castle Priory to live in. William is most noted for writing the &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England;&quot; these are noted for their influence on the American Constitution. Sir William died in Wallingford in 1780 and is buried in St Peter&#x27;s Church.

By the end of the 18th century, the Parliamentary Borough of Wallingford was known as being one of the worst rotten boroughs. During the Reform Act 1832, the constituency borders were increased geographically, and the number of MPs cut from two to one.

===20th and 21st centuries===
On 9 September 1944 a Halifax bomber of No. 426 Squadron RCAF, returning from an abandoned raid over the French port of Le Havre while still carrying a full bomb load, caught fire over Wallingford after its port outer engine exploded. Ordering most of his crew to bail out, the pilot, 23-year-old Flying Officer John Archibald Wilding, and his flight engineer, 22-year-old Sergeant John Francis Andrew, remained at the controls in order to steer the plane away from the town, crashing into the fields at Newnham Murren and thus preventing the possible loss of many civilian lives. Both Wilding and Andrew were mentioned in dispatches for their bravery, with Wilding being posthumously awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. They are commemorated by a memorial at the junction of Wilding Road and Andrew Road in Wallingford and by the Canadian flag that is flown over Wallingford Town Hall every year on 9 September in their memory.

Paul&#x27;s Malt on Hithercroft Road, built in 1958, was demolished in 2001; thus the malting industry ended, which had been key to Wallingford for hundreds of years. At one time there were at least 17 maltings in the town.

== Landmarks and structures ==
=== Wallingford Bridge ===
Wallingford Bridge is a medieval road bridge over the River Thames connecting Wallingford to Crowmarsh Gifford. Wallingford has historically been an important crossing point of the Thames owing to the presence of a ford which was used before the construction of a bridge. This ford was used by William the Conqueror and his armies on his journey to London after his victory at Hastings in 1066. The first reference to a bridge is from 1141 when King Stephen besieged Wallingford Castle. The first stone bridge is credited to Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, and four remaining arches are believed to contain 13th-century elements.

Major repairs used stone from the dissolved Holy Trinity Priory in 1530. Four arches were removed so that a drawbridge could be inserted during the siege of the castle in the Civil War of 1646, and these were replaced with timber structures until repair in 1751. Following a flood, three arches were rebuilt by Richard Clarke from 1810–1812 to a design by John Treacher (1760–1836) developed in 1809, and a parapet and balustrade added. The street lights on the bridge were made in the town and feature the Wilder mark on the base.

=== Wallingford Castle ===
Wallingford Castle was a major medieval castle. Established in the 11th century as a motte-and-bailey design within an Anglo-Saxon &quot;burgh&quot;, it grew to become what historian Nicholas Brooks has described as &quot;one of the most powerful royal castles of the 12th and 13th centuries&quot;. During The Anarchy the castle held the Empress Matilda and her son the future King Henry II. It was the site of the signing of the Treaty of Wallingford, which began the end of the conflict and set the path to a negotiated peace. Over the next two centuries Wallingford became a luxurious castle, used by royalty and their immediate family. After being abandoned as a royal residence by Henry VIII, the castle fell into decline.

Refortified during the English Civil War, Wallingford was held as a Royalist stronghold commanded by Colonel Thomas Blagge. In 1645 General Thomas Fairfax placed Wallingford Castle under siege; after 16 weeks, during which Oxford fell to Parliamentary forces, the castle finally surrendered in July 1646 under generous terms for the defenders. The risk of civil conflict continued, however, and Oliver Cromwell decided that it was necessary to slight the castle in 1652, as it remained a surprisingly powerful fortress and a continuing threat should any fresh uprising occur.

The castle was virtually razed to the ground in the operation, although a brick building continued to be used as a prison into the 18th century. A large house was built in the bailey in 1700, followed by a Gothic mansion house on the same site in 1837. The mansion, abandoned due to rising costs, was demolished in 1972, allowing Wallingford Castle to be declared a scheduled monument as well as a Grade I listed building. The castle grounds, including the remains of St Nicholas College, sections of the castle wall and the motte hill, are now open to the public.

=== St Peter&#x27;s Church ===
An earlier church on the site of St Peter&#x27;s Church was destroyed in 1646 during the siege of Wallingford in the Civil War. Building of the present church started in 1763, the contractors being William Toovey and Joseph Tuckwell. In 1767 the interior of the church was paved, pews were added and the exterior was stuccoed under the supervision of Sir Robert Taylor. A spire designed by Taylor was added in 1776–77. A local resident, Sir William Blackstone, a lawyer and author of the &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot;, took an interest in the building of the spire and paid for the clock face visible from his house. The chancel was built in 1904, designed by Sydney Stephenson. The church was declared redundant on 1 May 1971, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 26 July 1972. St Peter&#x27;s is the final resting place of Sir William Blackstone, who is buried in his family vault under the church.

=== St Mary-le-More Church ===

The Church of St Mary-le-More is located in a prominent position in the town square behind Wallingford Town Hall. The church appears in records from 1077, when the advowson belonged to St Alban&#x27;s Abbey. The west bell tower was originally 12th century, but its upper stages were rebuilt in a Perpendicular Gothic style out of the stone from Wallingford Castle when it was demolished by Oliver Cromwell after the Civil War. The nave and aisle were built in the 13th and 14th century, and the chancel was built later. However, all were rebuilt in 1854 to designs by the Gothic Revival architect David Brandon.

The west window of the north aisle has stained glass made in 1856 by Thomas Willement. The pulpit was made in 1888 by the sculptor Onslow Ford. The church tower features a ring of ten bells. A ring of eight including the tenor was cast in 1738 by Richard Phelps and Thomas Lester of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry re-cast the second bell of that ring, now the fourth bell of the present ring, in 1887, the year of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. In 2003 the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast a new treble and second bell, increasing the number of bells to ten.

=== St Leonard&#x27;s Church ===

St Leonard’s is the oldest church and is regarded as the oldest surviving place of worship in Wallingford. There has been a church on the site since Saxon times, when it was known as the Church of the Holy Trinity the Lesser. The current building still features distinctive Saxon stone work in the herringbone style around the north wall. Estimates for the start of construction point as early as the 6th century. Parliamentary forces used the church as a barracks during the Siege of Wallingford in 1656. Their occupation caused substantial damage to the building. Repair works were only completed in 1700 when it reopened.

John Henry Hakewill directed a reconstruction of the church in 1849, although the Church was rebuilt in the Gothic Revival style the restoration works preserved large sections of the original Saxon Building. The church interior is noted for a series of four angel murals painted in 1889 by acclaimed artist George Dunlop Leslie who at the time lived on Thames Street. The Church now forms part of the Parish of St Mary-le-More with services being held on Sundays.

=== Wallingford War Memorial ===

Wallingford war memorial was designed by Edward Guy Dawber and William Honeybone, and unveiled in 1921. First World War (1914–1918) – Total names on memorial: 81. After 1945 the memorial was updated with Second World War (1939–1945) dates and names added to the base of the memorial – Total names on memorial: 36. The inscription reads:

TO THE GLORY OF GOD AND IN HONOURED AND GRATEFUL MEMORY OF THE MEN OF WALLINGFORD WHO LAID DOWN THEIR LIVES IN THE GREAT WAR 1914–1918. THEIR NAME LIVETH FOR EVERMORE
PASS NOT THIS STONE IN SORROWNO SORROW BUT IN PRIDEAND STRIVE TO LIVEAS NOBLY AS THEY DIED

The memorial is Grade II listed.

=== Kinecroft ===
The Kinecroft was known as the Canecroft in the 13th and 14th centuries, and in the 16th and 17th centuries as Kenny Croft. It comprises an open area of about seven acres surrounded on the south and western sides by ancient Saxon earthworks and formed part of the defensive fortifications of the town when it was an important Burh in the kingdom of Wessex. Events held in the Kinecroft include Bonfire Night, BunkFest, The Vintage Car Rally, The Wallingford Festival of Cycling and The Circus.

=== Bull Croft ===
The Bull Croft is an open area within the town&#x27;s Saxon defences. During the Saxon period the Parish Church of the Holy Trinity stood in the southwestern part of the present Bull Croft and by 1085 it had been taken over by the great abbey of St Albans and became part of the new Wallingford Priory. When the Priory was torn down by Cardinal Wolsey in 1525, the area was used as farming. The Bull Croft was given to the town in trust by Mr Powyss Lybbe in 1912 and is now used as a public park. Facilities on the site include a children&#x27;s play area, tennis courts and football pitches.

=== Town Hall ===

Wallingford Town Hall was constructed in 1670 and is located on the southern side of the market square with the War Memorial in front and the church of St Mary-le-More behind. The main hall and council chambers are on the first floor and feature a coved ceiling installed in 1887 to commemorate Queen Victoria&#x27;s Jubilee. The building currently hosts the Town Council for meetings and civic events. The balcony is used by the town&#x27;s Mayor at annual events. The ground floor has the town&#x27;s Tourist Information Office, and, until the corn exchange was built in 1856, the open area under the hall was used for the town&#x27;s corn market. The hall is open to all residents as a venue for private hire.

=== Corn Exchange ===

The Corn Exchange dates to 1856. The iron arches supporting the roof of the building were cast at the Wilders Foundry on Goldsmiths Lane. After the Second World War the Social Security Ministry used the Building as a food and unemployment office before it fell into disuse. It was purchased by the Sinodun players in 1975 for use as a theatre. They dedicated it to Agatha Christie, who was president of the society from 1951 to 1976. The Corn Exchange &amp; Sinodun Players were awarded the Queen&#x27;s Award for Voluntary Service in 2020.

=== Winterbrook House ===

Winterbrook House was the home of author Agatha Christie and her husband Max Mallowan from 1934 until her death in 1976 and his in 1978. It is believed that she based the home of her character Miss Marple, Danemead in the village of St. Mary Mead, on Winterbrook House. The house is privately owned and is part of the Agatha Christie Trail.

A permanent bronze memorial to Agatha Christie was placed in front of the Wallingford Museum during September- 2023, as sculpted by Ben Twiston-Davies. It depicts her in later life seated on a bench holding a book.

=== Flint House and Wallingford Museum ===
Wallingford Museum has collections of local interest and is housed in the grade II listed Tudor Flint House in the High Street. Flint House is a mid-16th-century timber-framed house with a 17th-century flint façade. It faces the Kinecroft, an open space in Wallingford which is bordered on two sides by Anglo-Saxon burh defences built in the 9th century. It is owned by Wallingford Town Council.

The museum has an extensive collection relating to the town&#x27;s history. Displays include archaeology, Wallingford Castle, and the town in medieval and Victorian times.

=== Wilders New Foundry, Goldsmiths Lane ===
Built in 1869 by Richard Wilder the new foundry was built to support the existing foundry on Fish Street. By this time there was rapidly increasing demand for the towns of cast iron working and equipment so more capacity was essential. The Building was decommissioned in 1983 and was converted into residential flats by 1984.

==Governance==
There are three tiers of local government covering Wallingford, at civil parish (town), district, and county level: Wallingford Town Council, South Oxfordshire District Council, and Oxfordshire County Council. The town council meets at the Town Hall and has its offices at 8A Castle Street.

===Administrative history===
Wallingford was an ancient borough. It was a borough by the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, at which time it was the largest town in Berkshire. Its first municipal charter was granted in 1156. The borough was subdivided into the four parishes of All Hallows, St Leonard, St Mary-le-More, and St Peter.

The borough was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country. All the parishes in the borough were united into a single civil parish of Wallingford in 1919.

The borough of Wallingford was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, which also transferred Wallingford to Oxfordshire. District-level functions formerly performed by the borough council passed to the new South Oxfordshire District Council. The government initially proposed calling the new district &#x27;Wallingford&#x27;, but the shadow council elected in 1973 to oversee the transition requested a change of name to &#x27;South Oxfordshire&#x27;, which was approved by the government before the new district formally came into being.

A successor parish covering the area of the former borough was created in 1974, with its council taking the name Wallingford Town Council.

===Constituency===
Since 2024, Wallingford has formed part of the Didcot and Wantage constituency.

There was a Wallingford constituency until 1885. From 1295 until 1832 it covered just the borough. In 1832, it was enlarged to cover several adjoining parts of Berkshire.

== Geography ==
===Climate===
As with the rest of the British Isles and Oxfordshire, Wallingford experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. There has been a weather station at the nearby Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology collecting data on the local climate since 1961. Temperature extremes at Wallingford vary from recorded in January 1982 to recorded in July 2006. Recent low temperatures include during January 2010 and during December 2010.

==Transport==
===River===
The River Thames has been a transport route for centuries, and Wallingford&#x27;s growth as a town relied partly on it. Coal was supplied from North East England by coaster to London and then by barge upriver to Wallingford. This supply could be unreliable in seasons when river currents were too strong or water levels were too low. In 1789 the Oxford Canal reached Oxford from Warwickshire, and the Duke&#x27;s Cut at Wolvercote gave it a connection to the Thames. This allowed coal from the Midlands to reach Wallingford by a shorter and more reliable route than by sea and river from the northeast. In 1799 the Oxford Canal consolidated its commercial position by buying an 80-year lease on a wharf on the Thames just above Wallingford Bridge.

Chalmore Lock, a summer or low-water lock and weir, was built at Chalmore Hole, Wallingford in 1838, However, much of the time the fall was only 18 inches, and the lock was open at both ends. It fell into disrepair, and the lock was removed in 1883. The missing lock is the subject of confusion in Jerome K. Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot;. A ferry had operated at the site from 1787 to transport horses across the river where the towpath changed banks. As the removal of the lock and weir meant that this was the longest clear stretch of the upper river, it was an ideal site for rowing, so the Oxford University Boat Club which had long trained here built a boathouse at Chalmore in 2006. In addition to the old Wallingford Bridge, a new bridge was built at Winterbrook in 1993 to carry the A4130 bypass around Wallingford.

===Rail===
The closest regular railway station to Wallingford is Cholsey, about three miles away. The Cholsey and Wallingford Railway is a heritage railway which runs along the old branch line between Cholsey and Wallingford.

The main line of the Great Western Railway passes to the south of Wallingford. A station called Wallingford Road opened with the line in 1840, but it was some away from the town itself, in open countryside between the villages of Cholsey and Moulsford.

On 2 July 1866 the Wallingford and Watlington Railway (W&amp;WR) was opened between Wallingford Road station (which was renamed Moulsford station at the same time) and a new Wallingford station, on the western side of the town. The plan had been to continue the branch line to Watlington, but in May 1866, the Overend, Gurney &amp; Co bank had crashed, causing one of the severest financial crises of the 19th century. The bank rate was raised to ten percent, which made it impossible for the W&amp;WR to raise the capital for its planned continuation. The company sold the line to the Great Western Railway in 1872, and it became known as the &quot;Wallingford Bunk&quot;. The junction station for the branch line was moved from Moulsford to a new station at Cholsey in 1892. British Railways closed the branch line to passengers in 1959 and to goods traffic in 1965, but the track between Hithercroft Road and Cholsey continued in use to serve the now demolished maltings until 1981 when BR removed the junction at Cholsey. The branch line was then preserved as the Cholsey and Wallingford Railway, which opened a new Wallingford station in 1985 for its tourist services, a short distance south of the original Wallingford station, which had been redeveloped.

===Bus===
All bus services for the town are operated by &quot;Thames Travel.&quot; The 33 operates every hour from Henley-on-Thames to Abingdon via Nuffield, Nettlebed, Wallingford, Didcot, Sutton Courtenay and Culham. The X40 operates every 30 minutes between Oxford and Reading via Wallingford and Woodcote.

== Economy ==
Historically, Wallingford was a centre for local trading in livestock and corn as well as the general trade of other goods. This decreased after the construction of the bridge at Abingdon. The town developed as a centre for the production of iron and machinery in the 18th century; this continued until the 1980s. The brewing industry was important with two breweries and 17 maltings in the town. This link was ended with the demolition of Paul&#x27;s Malt in 2001. The Lamb arcade was originally known as the Lamb Coaching Inn and in 1980 after being derelict for some years was converted into an Antiques Arcade. Champions hardware store has been serving the residents of the town since 1869.

In 2005, Waitrose moved into a new store in the town centre after occupying an old site in the south of the town for decades. The new store has 22,000 sq ft (2,000 m2) of retail space. A Lidl supermarket opened in January 2019 on the Hithercroft Road. The only banking facility left in the town is the Nationwide Building Society, There are three cashpoints available in the town. The main employers are primarily on the Hithercroft Trading Estate, established in the 1970s. There are some located at Howbury Park the other side of the river and also at Winterbrook Bridge. Rowse Honey is the UK&#x27;s largest manufacturer of honey and has been located in the town since 1987, after being founded in the nearby village of Ewelme in 1954. Other businesses are the Royal Mail, HR Wallingford, Centre for Ecology and Hydrology and Fugro. To the south east of the town is the headquarters for the non-profit agricultural organisation CABI.

==Sport and leisure==

A number of sports societies, clubs and associations are co-located at the Wallingford Sports Park. Wallingford Hockey Club traces its beginnings to 1894 and now comprises nine senior teams as well as the Wallingford Wildcats youth setup. Since 1995 the club has been based in the Wallingford Sports Centre. Wallingford Town F.C. was founded in 1922 is the local football club. They currently play in the Hellenic Football League, and their home games are played at the Wallingford Sports Centre.

Originally founded in 1967 as Cholsey RFC, the club changed its name to Wallingford Rugby Club when it moved to the Hithercroft sports ground in 1997. The club has a senior set up which includes fielding three competitive men&#x27;s senior teams as a development squad and three women&#x27;s teams known as the Maidens. The club is still headquartered on the Hithercroft which is now known as the Wallingford Sports Park. There are two Squash clubs in Wallingford. Wallingford Squash Club is in the town centre and the second is located at the Wallingford Sports Park. Pétanque Wallingford is based at the Park. Wallingford Castle Archers are also based at the Sports Park.

===Rowing===

Wallingford Regatta, formerly the Wallingford Skiff Regatta, was the only organised boating competition in 1949 on the longest stretch of the Thames between locks (Benson to Cleeve Locks). It had taken place every year in peacetime since the late 1890s, and there is evidence that it existed as early as 1861. In 1949 the regatta committee founded the Wallingford Rowing Club, which started competing in other regattas. The regatta was developed as a conventional regatta, although it still awards the Wallingford Skiff Regatta Cup. The town hosts the Wallingford Rowing Club, the Oxford Brookes University Boat Club. and the Oxford University Boat Club.

The regatta was held on the same reach at Wallingford for most of its existence, but river conditions caused problems, and there was a growing need for larger facilities. In 2001 the Regatta moved to a new home at Dorney Lake near Windsor where it is still held. The event is the largest single day rowing regatta in the UK. In 2008 the new Oxford University Boat Club opened in Wallingford. Located on the site of the disused Wallingford marina on the Thames Path, the building designed by Tuke Manton Architects LLP replaced the club&#x27;s historic home on the Isis, which was destroyed by fire in 1999.

===Wallingford festival of cycling===
The Wallingford Festival of Cycling started in 2015 with an attendance of 3000. In 2018 British cycling billed the event one of the largest cycling events of the year with events including both the 50 km and 110 km road sportives. In excess of 7500 were expected to attend. The event in 2015 was used as the backdrop for the filming of the Midsomer Murders episode called breaking the Chain. Breaking the Chain was the third episode of the 18th series.

===Music festivals===
Starting in 2002 in the Cross Keys pub, BunkFest, usually being held in the first week of September, has become the largest free multi-day festival in the UK with an attendance of over 25,000 in 2017. The BunkFest folk music festival combines a broad range of folk music, dance displays, a beer festival and the local Bunk steam railway. It is a not-for-profit festival. The festival is intended to appeal to a wide audience. The main stage features light music and dancing during the day and lively folk-rock and world music acts in the evening.

Other venues around the town feature a wide variety of acts, ranging from quiet, contemplative folk artists and singer-songwriters to raucous rock bands. It attracts between thirty and fifty dance sides. The dance programme has included Cotswold and Border Morris, Appalachian and Eastern European forms, as well as traditional Irish, Scottish and Welsh forms. Rug Fest is Wallingford&#x27;s summer music festival located at the Wallingford Sport Park on the Hithercroft. Founded in 2008, RugFest took two years off due to site refurbishments, returning in 2018. The 2018 festival was headlined by Scouting for Girls.

===Vintage Car Rally===
Founded in 2002 the Wallingford vintage car rally takes place on the Kinecroft in mid May with a parade that includes the whole town. In 2018 the number of cars in the parade increased to over 350, with just over 400 vehicles on show overall. The event is run for local charitable causes and raised £14,000 in 2018, which brought the cumulative total to over £100,000.

=== Wallingford School ===
Wallingford School is the successor to Wallingford Grammar School, founded in 1659 when Walter Bigg left money for a school in his will. Located to the north of the town, it is an academy school and part of the Merchant Taylors’ Oxfordshire Academy Trust. The school provides education for the Wallingford area for boys and girls between the ages of 11 and 18.

<text>Anna Maria is a city in Manatee County, Florida, United States. Anna Maria is part of the North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 968 at the 2020 census, down from 1,503 in 2010. 

The city occupies the northern part of Anna Maria Island and is one of three municipalities on the island. The others are Holmes Beach in the center and Bradenton Beach in the south.

==Etymology==
Former Tampa Mayor Madison Post (1818-1867) named the island for his wife Maria and his sister-in-law Anna. A popular legend, however, states that Ponce de Leon named the island for Maria Anna von der Pfalz-Neuburg, the queen of Charles II of Spain, the sponsor of his expedition.

In the past, pronunciation of the name differed: old timers said &quot;Anna Mar-EYE-a,&quot; but most people today say &quot;Anna Mar-EE-a.&quot;

==History==

In 1893, George Emerson Bean built a home near the present day Rod &amp; Reel Pier. Two years later in 1895 he filed a homesteaded claim of on the north part of Anna Maria Island. Prior to Bean&#x27;s homestead claim, Andrew Gowanlack would reside in the area where Bean would file his homestead at. However, Andrew never filed for a homestead claim but did receive three acres of land after Bean filed his homestead claim out of squatting rights. After George Bean&#x27;s death in 1898, the land went to his son, George Wilhelm Bean, who partnered with Charles Roser, a wealthy real estate developer from St. Petersburg, to form the Anna Maria Beach Company to develop the area.

In 1911, the Anna Maria City Pier would be built by the Anna Maria Beach Company to accommodate steamships carrying residents and visitors to the island. The pier would have several buildings attached to it. An extension of the pier containing a home would be built in 1913 before the area the house was on in the pier was destroyed in September 1927. 

The City of Anna Maria was officially incorporated as a municipality in 1923.

Sometime during 1927, a jail would be built as a form of containment for bar patrons who were rowdy and was used until 1940 when a fire would burn down its roof and cells.
Compiled in the late 1930s and first published in 1939, the Florida Guide listed Anna Maria&#x27;s population as 77 describing it as:

Bradenton would attempt to annex the City of Anna Maria in 1963. Anna Maria would hold a special election that was described as being &quot;non-official&quot; on April 2, 1963, to confirm Bradenton&#x27;s decision. However, it would not be approved as 297 voted against it while 9 voted in favor of it.

During Hurricane Irma in 2017, the city pier was damaged significantly. It was demolished the following year with plans to rebuild it. The historic city pier was rebuilt and opened in April 2020. The new pier, however, was also damaged significantly by Hurricane Milton in 2024.

<text>Bayshore Gardens is a census-designated place (CDP) and planned community in Manatee County, Florida, United States. The population was 19,904 at the 2020 census, up from 16,323 in 2010. It is part of the North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
In 1955, a New York syndicate led by developer Sydney R. Newman purchased the area now known as Bayshore Gardens on the west side of U.S. 41 along the eastern shore of Sarasota Bay, just north of the Sarasota/Manatee county line, and platted an area between what was dubbed Bayshore Gardens Parkway running from U.S. 41 to 26th Street West and Sarasota Bay that would become Bayshore Gardens. The property was purchased for about 2 million dollars, making it the most expensive land purchase in the area since the 1920s. The area, once fields for growing tomatoes, would include recreation areas and a marina, schools, churches, shopping centers and medical facilities as well as homes in the popular style of that time, now called mid-century modern.

By its grand opening in 1956, four model homes were built and seven available designs had been created for future residents to pick from, including the Seagrape, the Gladiola, and the most popular, the Bird of Paradise. Prices ranged from $8,000 to $15,000 for a home with a lot, and lower rates for veterans were advertised. The first home in Bayshore Gardens was sold in July 1956 to Jennie and Samuel Gibson in the Hibiscus style.

By April 1958, the neighborhood had 400 homes, all of which were designed by Bradenton architect Sidney Wilkinson and built by Richard Morton&#x27;s Bayshore Gardens Inc. The neighborhood was opened up that year to other developers and home builders, including Richmond Homes and Arrow Home Builders. Designs added by Richmond Homes included the Cayman, Expo, Lenfield, Something Special, Tarlton, and Windward. Arrow Home Builders were known for adding larger custom homes on the Bayshore Gardens waterfront

In November 1959, Bayshore Gardens Shopping Center held a grand opening with stores that included Publix, a beauty shop, barbershop, hardware store, shoe repair, and clothing stores. The neighborhood grew rapidly, and by 1960 it was the largest voting precinct in the county. That year, the shopping center was expanded to add more stores and a movie theater.

== Historical preservation ==
In 2014, students from the University of Florida and community members began inventorying the mid-century homes in the neighborhood as part of a project to have Bayshore Gardens designated as the state&#x27;s largest and most historically significant collection of mid-century residential architecture. Bayshore Gardens is still in the process of gaining a historical designation from the State of Florida.

<text>Bradenton ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Manatee County, Florida, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population is 55,698, up from 49,546 at the 2010 census. It is a principal city in the Sarasota metropolitan area. Downtown Bradenton is along the Manatee River and includes the Bradenton Riverwalk. Downtown Bradenton is also home to the Bishop Museum of Science and Nature.

To the south of Bradenton is Sarasota; beach communities on Anna Maria Island are to its west. The Manatee River and Palmetto on the other side of it are to its north.

== History ==

=== Late 18th and early 19th centuries ===
A settlement established by Maroons or escaped slaves named Angola existed in Bradenton&#x27;s present area starting in the late 1700s and ending in 1821. It is believed to been spread out between the Manatee River (then known as Oyster River) all the way to Sarasota Bay. The community is estimated to have had 600–750 residents. Angola was a rather large maroon settlement as the Manatee River at that time was too shallow for US Navy vessels to navigate. The settlement was abandoned after the Creeks who were aligned with Andrew Jackson attacked Angola.

When the United States annexed Florida in 1821, there were two known claimants of land in the vicinity of Bradenton but neither of them was confirmed by the US federal government.

=== Mid and late 19th century ===
Josiah Gates along with his family and eight slaves moved to the area where present-day Bradenton exists in January 1842 after being attracted to the area for its natural beauty. Gates thought the area would be a popular place for new settlers to arrive at because it was near Fort Brooke, and he also figured that while they were building their homes they would need a place to stay at temporarily. He built his home near present-day 15th Street East and his inn at another location naming it Gates House. Gates is also credited as being the first known American settler in present-day Manatee County.

Bradenton is named after Dr. Joseph Braden, whose nearby fort-like house was a refuge for early settlers during the Seminole Wars. Braden owned a sugar plantation in the area, covering and being worked by slave labor. Dr. Joseph Braden was originally from Virginia and relocated to Leon County in Florida shortly after its annexation by the United States in 1821 where he established a cotton plantation bringing his preexisting Virginia slaves along with him. After having financial difficulties from the Panic of 1837, he tried to reestablish himself financially in Manatee County in 1843 moving to the area along with his slaves. To help with the shipment of sugar grown at the plantation, he constructed a pier in present-day Downtown Bradenton where ships could dock at and pick up sugar. Where the pier met the land he constructed a stockade getting the name of Fort Braden. During the Third Seminole War, on April 6, 1856, Braden&#x27;s fortified home was attacked by several Seminole Indians, one of the few, albeit small, direct engagements of the war. Braden was financially successful with his plantation but ended up moving back to Leon County in 1857 because of a financial panic that occurred that year.

Major Alden Joseph Adams purchased 400 acres of land in 1876 between present-day Manatee Memorial Hospital and 9th Street East and build his home there in 1882. He named his three-story concrete home Villa Zanza. Alden was known for having many animals and a large amount of foliage at his home. At one point he owned over 300,000 acres of land in Manatee County. Major Alden Joseph Adams served in the Union Army during the American Civil War and eventually reached the rank of major. After the war he served in the US Secret Service and later as a newspaper correspondent for the &quot;New York Herald&quot;. He reported from Paris during the time when the Paris Commune existed. At one point he was asked to look for Dr. David Livingstone but declined and suggested that Henry Morton Stanley should look for him instead. Adams died in 1915, and his home was bought in 1924 with the intent of remodeling it. However it was not completed, and his home was demolished at some point in the late 1920s.

William I. Turner bought 7 acres from John Crews Pelot in 1877 and create a subdivision from that land creating what is now Bradenton. The land itself was plotted by Axel Emil Broberg and it contained 19 plots on both sides of what is 12th Street West along with a cross street that is currently 3rd Avenue. Turner sold the lots building a store and a warehouse along with his own home where he lived at.

The town was originally spelled &quot;Braidentown,&quot; as a spelling error was made when it applied for a post office on May 9, 1878. The first bridge across Wares Creek was built in 1886. The following year, Bradenton was designated the county seat after DeSoto County was formed from eastern Manatee County, as the then county seat, Pine Level, was in the new county. A county courthouse was built in 1890 at Courthouse Square.

=== 20th century ===

==== First half of the 20th century ====

Railroad service was extended from Palmetto across the Manatee River to Bradenton in 1902. Bradenton was incorporated on May 19, 1903, with 59 voting in favor of incorporating and 34 voting against it. Shortly after incorporation, a local election was held to choose the city&#x27;s first elected municipal officials. A.T Cornwell was elected as mayor, Robert H. Roesch as clerk and tax assessor, A.B. Murphy as treasurer and F. Dryman as tax collector along with seven city council members. One of the earliest moves made by the municipal government was amending the name to &quot;Bradentown&quot;. However the name change would not be reflected with the US Postal Service until 1905. On December 29, a streetcar line began operation going from Bradenton to the neighboring city of Manatee and went west crossing Wares Creek to the nearby community of Fogartyville. The company operating the line had financial difficulties, likely due to a lack of ridership, and cancelled the line in 1906. The Manavista Hotel was opened in January 1907 bordering the Manatee River on Main Street.

The Davis Bridge, the first general traffic bridge across the Manatee River was opened in June 1910. It was a wooden toll bridge built by C.H. Davis that had one lane and passing spots. The bridge went from present-day 9th Street East (located within then nearby Manatee) to near where the Atwood Grapefruit Groves were located at west of Ellenton. In 1912, the first road, Range Road leading from present-day Bradenton (then, Manatee) to Sarasota was built. Also during that year, the original county courthouse was bought and moved to a new location becoming a grade school for black students in the area, Lincoln Academy Grammar School. A new courthouse was built on the site of the old one which still stands today in the following year, 1913. The Victory Bridge was opened in August 1919 running from current 10th Street West in Bradenton to 8th Avenue in Palmetto. Funding for the bridge came from bond issues by both Bradenton and Palmetto. The bridge itself had two lanes and was made of wood. Its name came from the United States&#x27; recent victory in World War I against the Central Powers. With the Victory Bridge&#x27;s construction, the municipal government of Manatee attempted to buy Davis Bridge and make it public as a way to compete with Bradenton&#x27;s Victory Bridge but the deal however never went through. The rest of the bridge ended up being dismantled with the exception of its draw section which was sold to county government and put into use for the Snead Island&#x27;s Cut off bridge in 1920.

==== 1920s and 1930s ====
Baseball spring training began in Bradenton with the construction of Ninth Street Park in 1923. The first team to train in the city was the St. Louis Cardinals, doing so for 1923 and 1924. The city council began the process of removing the &quot;w&quot; letter from its then name &quot;Bradentown&quot; in January 1925 and be completed on May 2, 1925, when the state Governor signed a bill relating to it making it official. All streets in the city were renamed in 1926 with a numbering system.

After the collapse of the Florida land boom and the Great Depression starting, the city faced an economic downturn. Along with an economic downturn, the city had financial issues as well with the city going into debt. During the Florida land boom, Bradenton borrowed money as a way to pay for infrastructure to areas that were considered outlying. As a result, the city retracted its municipal boundaries so it could not provide services to those areas and defaulted their municipal bonds as a result. After the municipal boundaries were retracted, the bonds were refunded, and residents who lived in the new boundaries would be responsible for paying it. Bradenton ended up eventually getting its bonds paid off. Despite the economic downtown, several new projects were done in the city. A municipal pier (interchangeably referred to as Memorial pier) was built in 1927 with a building at its end. The pier itself still stands and the building at its end has served a variety of functions ever since. As the Victory Bridge was deemed too unsafe to use after a hurricane hit it in 1926, the Green Bridge was built the following year in 1927 as a replacement to it. In the meantime, a ferry operated until the Green Bridge was built. On July 22, 1931, a joint committee was appointed by the municipal city councils of Bradenton, Manatee, and Palmetto to consider and possibly even merge the three cities but nothing would come out of the committee in the end. A new post office building in 1937 was built on Manatee Avenue and 9th Street West as a Works Progress Administration project. The post office is still in operation.

Compiled in the late 1930s and first published in 1939, the Florida guide listed Bradenton&#x27;s population as being 5,986 and described it as:

==== 1940s ====

Bradenton was affected by World War II like many other cities in Florida and the United States. During the war, Manatee County had its own Civil Defense battalion in it with two subunits existing in Bradenton and another for nearby Manatee. A recreational center was opened in March 1942 at a building on the intersection of 6th Avenue and 12th Street West in the downtown area to be used by soldiers. The recreation center closed in November 1945 and was popular with local soldiers and visited even by those who were stationed outside of Bradenton. Police Chief Clyde Benton expanded the police force by naming 45 officers to serve without pay during the war. Camp Weatherford located at LECOM Field existed for eight months at some point during the war as a training center for the US Army Signal Corps. About 350 soldiers were trained there during its existence. The camp itself often had an issue with being flooded because of the rainy climate, showers at the camp occurring often, clothes being washed, its low elevation and is located nearby to Wares Creek. A soldier named Joe Grossman at the camp ran a radio show broadcasting on WSPB called Weatherford Shinings. Local residents accommodated the troops stationed at the base in a variety of ways. Bradenton merged with nearby Manatee (incorporated in 1888) in 1943. Manatee faced similar financial problems as Bradenton did in regards to their bonds and faced high debt levels as a result but Manatee could not pay off the bonds.

==== Second half of the 20th century ====
Mayor A. Sterling Hall took office in January 1948. During his tenure lasting the next 20 years before retiring, the city was radically transformed. While serving as mayor he was considered progressive in his time period when it came to racial issues. As mayor, he created a municipal housing authority and also do slum clearance. He created quality housing for black residents along with paving streets, bringing sewage service, water, and expanded garbage collection services to black neighborhoods. Despite Mayor Hall&#x27;s racial progressiveness, a Ku Klux Klan march occurred during his tenure in 1958 between Palmetto and Bradenton. The reason for the march was in response to a black group asking the county school board to either give them a new school building in Bradenton or integrate junior and senior high schools in the county. The Manavista Hotel was demolished in 1959 and replaced with a motel and later a retirement community. During the 1960s the Manatee River was dredged, and an area nicknamed &quot;the Sandpile&quot; was formed getting developed over the course of the rest of the 20th century and the 21st century. During the Civil Rights Movement, Mayor Hall tried to make desegregation come about in his city in a nonviolent manner. Lunch counters were desegregated sometime during 1960 and a biracial commission was created during the summer of 1963.

Bradenton built a new city hall located on 15th Street West bordering Wares Creek in January 1970 as a replacement to their location on 13th Street West, which the city had used since 1913. Governor Claude R. Kirk Jr. arrived in Bradenton on April 6, 1970, in an attempt to stop Manatee County School District&#x27;s desegregation busing. When he arrived he suspended the district superintendent along with the school district, leading to the district stopping the busing of 2,500 students and 107 teachers. During February he threatened to impeach a federal judge and said he would not sign checks that would pay for busing students. He stayed in the Manatee County School District&#x27;s Administration building then located at the corner of 9th Avenue and 14th Street for a week before being threatened with a $10,000 fine per day if he continued to stay in the building and was unsuccessful with preventing bussing. The 8-floor Hotel Dixie Grande, which opened in April 1926, was demolished in August 1974.

The Green Bridge was replaced in 1986. The city hall moved to a new location on 12th Street West in November 1998 after the property was sold to a local resident with the intention of redeveloping it but plans never materialized.

=== 21st century ===
The local resident who had owned the former city hall property along Wares Creek sold it to a development group sometime in 2004, and it was demolished in December 2004. The Bradenton Riverwalk, a 1.5-mile long park along the Manatee River opened in October 2012. McKechnie Field, the spring training stadium for the Pittsburgh Pirates, was renamed LECOM Park in February 2017.

<text>Bradenton Beach is a city on Anna Maria Island in Manatee County, Florida, United States. The population was 908 at the 2020 census, down from 1,171 in 2010. It is part of the North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. 

The city occupies the southern part of Anna Maria Island and is one of three municipalities on the island. The others are Holmes Beach in the center and Anna Maria in the north.

==History==

=== Pre-1950 ===

==== 1920s &amp; 1930s ====
The City of Bradenton Beach was settled in 1893, and referred to as &quot;Cortez Beach&quot; since it was close to the community of Cortez. Construction on a wooden bridge to the mainland began in the summer of 1921. The 1921 Tampa Bay hurricane that October destroyed 80% of the bridge that was built up to that point. Despite a majority of the bridge being destroyed, it was completed sometime in June 1922, eight months later.

A two-story pavilion at the end of Bridge Street was built that same year. It had 100 lockers along with a dance hall and dining room located in the center of the building. On the second floor, the owners of the pavilion had their apartments. It would burn down after a fire and was later rebuilt. The pavilion was destroyed by fire for a second time in 1929 and was never rebuilt. The name &quot;Bradenton Beach&quot; began being used during the mid 1920s as the Florida land boom was occurring. Real estate developers saw this as a way to convince possible buyers that it was closer to Bradenton. Sometime in early 1926, a county bond was approved to build a wooden bridge linking Bradenton Beach to Longboat Key; the bridge was finished in August. However, the bridge was only open until October, when a hurricane damaged it. On March 6, 1932, the bridge was swept away during a high tide. It would not be replaced until 1957.

==== 1940s ====
The &quot;Regina&quot;, a tanker barge with over 350,000 gallons of molasses onboard and eight crew, sank 200 yards offshore on a sandbar on March 8, 1940. &quot;Regina&quot; was under tow by a tugboat, &quot;Minima&quot; and the line that was towing it had broken near Egmont Key. Both vessels had decided to try and go into Tampa Bay seeking shelter because of the weather conditions. One of the crew members, its cook and a German Shepherd onboard the ship would die during an attempt to leave the ship. All seven other crew members were rescued.

A post office called Bradenton Beach has been in operation since 1941.

=== Post-1950 ===
Bradenton Beach was incorporated on December 21, 1952, after an 84–56 vote to become a city. Bernard Wagaman served as Bradenton Beach&#x27;s first mayor; he owned a cottage rental apartment complex there named Wagaman&#x27;s Modern Apartments.

The main wooden bridge to the island from Cortez was replaced by a concrete one in 1957 as local residents wanted a stronger bridge. A parade led by an elephant was hosted by the city to display its strength and to convince the local residents as well. To offset the cost of the bridge, the local government made it a toll bridge until 1964 when it was reimbursed. Cars were charged 30¢ entering the island, and no toll was charged on those leaving the island.

<text>Cortez, a census-designated place (CDP) in Manatee County, Florida, United States, is a small Gulf Coast commercial fishing village that was founded by settlers from North Carolina in the 1880s. The population was 4,121 at the 2020 census, down from 4,241 at the 2010 census. It is part of the North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

=== Early history ===
Present-day Cortez was a part of the Safety Harbor culture region from about 900 CE until the 1700s. The Safety Culture people formed chiefdoms and villages along the shoreline of Tampa Bay and the adjacent Gulf of Mexico coast. Safety Harbor culture is defined by the presence of Safety Harbor ceramics in burial mounds, which have been excavated from nearby archaeological sites in present-day Manatee County. The Safety Harbor culture virtually disappeared due to disease and incursions by other Native Americans.

The Calusa people, often referred to as the &quot;Shell Indians&quot;, also inhabited the southwest coast of Florida. The Calusa were first recorded by Spanish explorers in 1513, but were likely living on the coast long before they were recorded doing so. The Calusa became the dominant power in the Tampa Bay area with the waning of the Safety Harbor Culture in the 1600s. The Calusa are believed to have stayed in the area until 1763 when the remaining Calusa, their numbers having already dwindled due to disease and warfare, left Florida to settle in Cuba. The Calusa are believed to have lived along inner waterways in homes built on stilts. Unlike many other tribes, the Calusa did not hunt but rather fished for subsistence. The Calusa people were prolific fishermen. The Calusa people made nets from palm tree webbing in order to catch mullet, pin-fish, pig-fish, and catfish. They used spears topped with arrowheads crafted from fish teeth and spines in order to hunt eels and turtles. Women and children of the tribe caught shellfish, including crabs, lobsters, oysters, clams, and conch. They used the shells they collected to make a variety of things such as tools, utensils, ornaments, weapons, and jewelry. The eventual demise of the Calusa people is attributed to invasions from other tribes and disease brought by Spanish and French explorers.

Cuban fishermen began journeying northward in order to fish the waters of the Gulf Coast of Florida around the mid-1700s. Once the journey to Florida had been made, the fishermen would set up temporary camps called &quot;ranchos&quot; where they would reside for around half a year while they fished the plentiful waters of the area. Catches were dried and salted so that they could be transported back to Cuba to be sold. This proved effective as the fishermen would return home before Lent to sell their catch when fish was in high demand. The waters surrounding Cuba are viable fishing waters, but they were fished heavily. The waters near the Gulf Coast of Florida were particularly appealing to the ranchos because there were not yet any permanent settlements in the area. This means that the water in the area was an untapped resource of fish, all theirs for the taking. This area was made all the more appealing because its environment was conducive to inshore net fishing (the preferred method of the Spanish Cuban fishermen).

=== Founding and 19th century ===

Originally called &quot;Hunter&#x27;s Point&quot;, Cortez was settled in the 1880s by families from Carteret County, North Carolina. When a post office was established in 1888, the village needed a new name to avoid confusion with another Hunter&#x27;s Point in Florida. Although the origins of the name &quot;Cortez&quot; cannot be officially proven, the community may have been named after the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés. In its early days, Cortez was a fishing village so rural that it was more often reached by water than by land. The mainstay of Cortez was and still is its success in the commercial fishing industry.

==== The 1890 Bratton/Burton Store ====
The first commercial building in Cortez was built by William C. Bratton in the 1890s. This building helped to connect Cortez with the outside world. The Bratton/Burton Store housed the post office, general store, and steamboat wharf. About a decade after its original construction, construction on rooms began in order to expand it into the Albion Inn. The Albion Inn along with the 1912 school house were some of the only buildings on the waterfront to survive the hurricane of 1921. The Inn eventually closed and was sold to the U.S. Coast Guard. The Bratton/Burton Store served as U.S. Coast Guard Station Cortez from 1974 until 1991 - when it was slated for demolition. Cortez residents came together to save the Bratton/Burton Store portion of the building from demolition. In 2006, it was moved to the grounds of the Florida Maritime Museum.

=== Cortez in the 20th century ===
==== 1912 Rural Graded Schoolhouse ====
Prior to 1912, the young children of Cortez were educated in a one-room, wood schoolhouse. In 1912, the one-room schoolhouse was replaced with a larger, brick one referred to as the Cortez Rural Graded Schoolhouse. The Cortez Mother&#x27;s Club played a large part in the construction and success of the new schoolhouse. The building became a community hub for Cortez and provided shelter for many during the hurricane of 1921. The schoolhouse was first build with three classrooms, but in 1933 one of the classrooms was extended to serve as an auditorium. This building was used as a school for the children of Cortez until 1961. An art school then leased the building before being sold to weaver Robert Sailors in 1974. Sailors used the schoolhouse as his home and studio. After his death, Manatee County purchased the schoolhouse and began the process of restoring it in 1999. In 2006, the schoolhouse was reopened as a museum. Today, the Cortez Rural Graded Schoolhouse houses the Florida Maritime Museum.

==== World War One ====
When the United States entered World War I in 1917, residents served in a variety of capacities. Ten residents are known to have served, with eight going into the US Army and two into the US Navy.

==== Building of the Cortez Bridge ====
Construction on the Cortez Bridge connecting Anna Maria Island to Cortez began in 1921. Anna Maria Island was not connected to the mainland prior to this and so could only be accessed by boat. Construction on the bridge came to a halt after the hurricane of 1921 hit, destroying any progress that had been made on the bridge. In 1922, construction began again and the wooden bridge was completed. The wooden bridge connected Cortez Road to Bradenton Beach&#x27;s Bridge Street. In the 1950s, the wooden Cortez Bridge was replaced with the current concrete bridge. To prove how stable the new bridge was, elephants from Ringling Circus were brought over and paraded across the bridge for all to see.

==== The hurricane of 1921 ====
In October 1921, Cortez was unexpectedly and brutally hit by a hurricane estimated to have been either a category three or four. The hurricane of 1921 was reportedly the most damaging to hit the Tampa Bay area since the mid-1800s. The people of Cortez had little to no warning that the storm was coming before it hit, so they took refuge in the 1912 Rural Graded Schoolhouse. The hurricane of 1921 almost completely destroyed the waterfront. Leaving few structures standing, the waterfront had to be rebuilt and is now barely recognizable from what it once was.

==== Roaring Twenties and Great Depression ====
During the 1920s many new changes would come to the village of Cortez. For the first time ever shipments of seafood were delivered by road as residents got cars. Electricity would also become common in the village reducing much of the work load.

Cortez during the Great Depression was notably one of the only communities in the United States not to receive federal aid.

==== World War Two ====
As with all other areas of the country, Cortez was greatly impacted by World War II. Most men in Cortez went to war whether they enlisted or were drafted, and those that enlisted largely did so in the U.S. Navy or Coast Guard, as sailing was their way of life. Many women also went off to war, to serve as nurses and medical personnel. Those left behind during the war effort worked to ensure the survival of Cortez and its fishing industry. Although fishing prior to WWII was seen as a family business, with most of the young men and many of the women of Cortez gone workers were hired from outside of the family. Women and young girls began working and fishing for seventy five cents an hour to support their families and fill in for the men.

<doc id="109379" wikidata="Q2004474" url="?curid=109379" title="Holmes Beach, Florida">
<text>Holmes Beach is a city on Anna Maria Island in Manatee County, Florida, United States. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 3,010, down from 3,836 at the 2010 census. It is part of the North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city occupies the central part of Anna Maria Island and is one of three municipalities on the island. The others are Bradenton Beach in the south and Anna Maria in the north.

==History==
Holmes Beach was named for John E. Holmes Sr., the property developer who started this planned community after World War II. During World War II, Holmes was stationed in Tampa. Holmes obtained the interest of three others, Frank B. Giles of Georgia, Pedar Mickelsen of Minnesota and Francis Karel of Chicago, to help develop it. In 1947 or 1948 a small airport was built. One person had a plane at the airport and used it as an air taxi during the tourist season and was used by residents and visitors taking them to wherever they wanted to go. Holmes Beach was incorporated on March 13, 1950, during a meeting about incorporating with 46 voting in favor, 13 against and 1 in abstention. Opponents of incorporation argued that tax money from cigarettes and liquor sales would be lost along with county assistance for road maintenance. Those in favor of incorporation argued that it would be easier for lenders to finance new construction on the island and give local residents an equal weight for their voice in their own government. Despite a request not to use anyone&#x27;s name, Holmes Beach was decided on, although names such as Palm City, Mid-Island Beach, Coquina Beach and Tarpon Beach were considered as well. At the end of the meeting the city&#x27;s first officials were elected.

Manatee Public Beach located at the intersection of Manatee Avenue and Gulf Drive opened in 1952, originally as Manatee County Public Beach. It was managed by a local Kiwanis Club chapter, with all proceeds going to local charity-related initiatives. During the 1950s and 1960s, the beach was racially segregated like many others in the Southeastern United States. It is not clear, however, when the beach was officially desegregated. The beach was renamed &quot;Manatee Beach&quot; before being changed to Manatee Public Beach.

In 1954, Holmes Beach annexed the neighboring subdivision communities of Ilexhurst, Jones, and Casanas, bringing the entirety of Anna Maria Island under municipal governments.

An airport that had existed closed in 1973 because of the cost to maintain it and that it needed improvements. Between 1975 and 1980, the airport land was redeveloped by the municipal government.

==Geography==
The exact coordinates for the city of Holmes Beach are .

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , or 12.19%, are water.

===Key Royale===
Included in the city limits is the adjacent bayside island of Key Royale, formerly known as School Key. It was uninhabited until 1960, when a bridge was built joining it to the Holmes Beach section of Anna Maria Island; development then began.

==Climate==
The city of Holmes Beach is part of the humid subtropical climate zone with a Köppen Climate Classification of &quot;Cfa&quot; (C = mild temperate, f = fully humid, and a = hot summer).

<text>Longboat Key is a town in Manatee and Sarasota counties along the central west coast of the U.S. state of Florida, located on and coterminous with the barrier island of the same name. Longboat Key is south of Anna Maria Island, between Sarasota Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. It is almost equally divided between the Manatee and Sarasota counties. The town of Longboat Key was incorporated in 1955 and is part of the North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The town&#x27;s population was 7,505 at the 2020 census, up from 6,888 at the 2010 census.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

Longboat Key was originally inhabited by Native Americans. The area of what is now Longboat Key was scouted by Juan de Añasco who was the first known European to explore the key and Hernando De Soto&#x27;s as his scout. He spent about two months attempting to find a landing site, and he was also most likely the first European man to see and explore Sarasota Bay, Boca Ciega Bay and the Manatee River. According to local legend, he believed the Indians were hostile. When the party reached land on the island, the Indians fled leaving their Longboat in a bayou. Pirate Jean Lafitte was said to have been shipwrecked near or on Longboat Key.

Prior to 1842, Cuban and Spanish fishermen along with some squatters resided on the island. A fishing camp and a trading post for Native Americans existed in the northern part of the key located in what is presently the Longboat Village. At the time, the area was referred to on maps as &quot;Saraxola&quot; and &quot;Zarazote&quot;. An 1839 map compiled by order of General Zachary Taylor during the Second Seminole War called the island Palm Island. 

There is little known about the island after 1848 and until the 1880s, because a hurricane hit the area and destroyed most of Longboat Key. The only thing known is that Charles Abbe had a plantation at an unknown location on the island where citrus and pineapples were grown.

=== Late 1800s and early 1900s ===

The first people of European descent to claim land on the island were Colin and Rowlin W. Witt, claiming on the north end of the island in 1882. Several others would claim land on the island during the late 1800s, but none of them are known to have lived on the island permanently.

In 1884, Thomas Mann claimed on the key. He and his family moved there in 1888, becoming the first known permanent residents on the key. His home was located somewhere on the north end of the key.

Mann was a carpenter by trade who was originally from Indiana and later moved to Minnesota. During the American Civil War he served the Union under the 7th Minnesota Infantry Regiment. Mann and his family moved to what is known today as Bradenton in 1872. He left because of either a local yellow fever epidemic or prejudice against him from being from the Northern United States. Mann died in 1908 in nearby Cortez. His son, James, claimed south of his father&#x27;s land in 1891.

With a passage being dug in 1895 from Sarasota Bay to Tampa Bay, steamships and paddle boats could access the island. Soon, a mail service was established that brought residents mail from Cortez. Thomas Mann sold his land in 1898 to May and June Pointevesant of Ocean Springs, Mississippi.

Longboat Key&#x27;s first post office was established in 1907 at Byron Corey&#x27;s pier at the southern end of the island, where he owned of land beginning in 1903. Corey also served as Longboat Key&#x27;s first postmaster. The post office on the sound end lasted until 1921, when it was destroyed by a hurricane.

During the 1910s, the key saw a surge in development and changes to it. The Pointevesants sold their land to Rufus Perry Jordan and Annie Jordan in May 1911. Rufus laid out a community named Longbeach, filling the plat in November 1911. During 1913, another subdivision named Shore Acres that covered 170 acres of land was developed at the &quot;narrowest&quot; part of the island, and was finished by the next year. Another community was also started at about the same time, named Island Beach, located south of it. Longbeach gained its own post office in 1914. During the early 1900s and prior to the 1921 hurricane, Longboat Key had a significant farming presence, with local residents growing a variety of products. A 1912 &quot;Sarasota Times&quot; headline read: &quot;From a lonely Key, it is now a center of trucking and fruit growing.&quot;

=== 1920s ===

In 1921, the key lost most of its agricultural land and buildings during a hurricane. That same year, the island was split between two counties, Sarasota and Manatee.

Starting in 1923, John Ringling purchased a large amount of land on Longboat Key. In February 1926, Ringling entered a contract to develop a luxury hotel named the Ritz-Carlton on the south side of the island. The hotel was to have 200+ rooms, docking facilities and a railroad leading to it to bring guests there. The hotel began construction in March 1926, with a completion date before December 15, 1926 as specified in the contract. An 18-hole golf course would be built next to the hotel as well. Ringling found himself preoccupied with other financial interests, and during that year the Florida land boom began to slow down as well. In November he ordered construction to be stopped on the hotel, and later claimed he would resume construction, but never did.

There were no roads that led to the key until 1929, when a bridge was built to St. Armands. A bridge across Longboat Pass was built in April 1929 and would exist until March 1932.

=== 1930s and 1940s ===

Starting in 1935, a former Chicago insurance agent named Gordon Whitney started buying up property to construct a series of cottages on the northern end of the island. The area was given the name of Whitney Beach. Whitney intended to have the cottages serve as part of a resort.

In 1936, for the first time, telephone service was brought to the southern part of the island. 

In 1937, John Ringling North, the head of the estate of John Ringling, who had died in 1936, announced that Martin Sweeney had an interest in finishing the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. Sweeney said the hotel would have two 18 hole golf courses, an airport, a club and facilities for fishing, along with 235 rooms when completed. However, these plans would never transpire and the hotel remained in its then-current state.

By 1939 or 1940, telephone service was brought to the North End. Longboat Key got its first newspaper, &quot;Gulf Gale&quot;, in 1941; it would run until 1944.

In World War II, Longboat Key had a bombing range. In 1942, it was used by B-26 planes, and from 1943 to 1945 by P-40 and P-51 planes. The range was used between 8am and 5pm, which meant that residents on the northern side of the island could not go south of it until after its training sessions.

=== 1950s to the present ===

On November 13, 1955, the town was incorporated by a 186–13 vote at a meeting in a fire station. The meeting itself lasted for 3 hours and 10 minutes in total. Reasons for supporting incorporation included that Longboat Key could have more say in its governmental affairs. It is also believed that the placement of a segregated beach for African-Americans on the island was a motivator behind incorporating it. By incorporating the entire key, they could somehow avoid the placement of the beach altogether. Residents also held meetings protesting the beach&#x27;s placement. Significant arguments against incorporation were that property taxes would go up. After doing the incorporation vote, Will LePage was elected as the first mayor, along with the first eight members of the Board of Aldermen. At the time, only about a third of Longboat Key was developed, and roughly 215 people lived on the key. When the town was incorporated, it changed its name from Longbeach to Longboat Key.

In 1959, the Arvida Corporation created by Arthur Vining Davis purchased 2,000 acres, which included the southern half of Longboat Key, a majority of Lido Key, along with Bird Key, Otter Key, and Coon Key, at a price of $13.5 million. It was expected that the population would be increased by 12,000 extra residents. Some of the land purchased would come from John Ringling North, and on his Longboat Key land included the unfinished Ritz-Carlton Hotel. There was a proposal in 1962 by a Sarasota realtor to finish its construction and make it into a convention site for Sarasota. However, Arvida had no interest in either selling or attempting to finish the hotel. The hotel was torn down between December 1963 and January 1964. Debris from the demolished hotel would be used as fill for the city&#x27;s civic center and City Island.

In early 2024, it was announced that a new public library would be built on Longboat Key. The library is to be a part of the Sarasota County Library System.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 74.19%, of which is water.

Longboat Key is located north of St. Armands Key, with its circle of shopping and dining, and Lido Key, and south of Bradenton Beach, Holmes Beach, and Anna Maria, which are located on the adjacent Anna Maria Island. The nearby cities of Sarasota and Bradenton and the Sarasota–Bradenton International Airport rounds out Longboat Key&#x27;s varied list of geographic amenities. State Road 789 (Gulf of Mexico Drive) runs the length of the island, with ancillary boulevards branching off to residential neighborhoods. From some locations one can see both Sarasota Bay and the Gulf of Mexico.

At other points the island widens and accommodates various homes owned by both singly and in condominiums, hotels, and sports clubs. Some Longboat Key residents are &quot;snowbirds&quot;, who vacation at or own second homes on Longboat Key, and are present only during the winter months. Others are homesteaders, utilizing the various homestead exemptions provided to Florida citizens who own and occupy their principal residences within the state, as set forth under the Florida Constitution. 

Most of the Gulf side of Longboat Key consists of beaches. The southernmost area of the key is mostly part of the Longboat Key Club.

=== Jewfish Key ===
Jewfish Key is an island that covers located within city limits. The island is only accessible via boat and the eastern part of the key is a nature reserve. Electricity is provided via underwater cables and there are no landline phone lines to the key. Residents of the island get water from wells and use septic tanks.

Until the 1930s, Jewfish Key was two islands: Pickett Key to the north and Fisherman&#x27;s Key located to the south. When the US Army Corps of Engineers dredged the Intracoastal Waterway they needed a place to deposit the spoil; and the two owners (whose last names were Jordan and Zeisse) allowed for the spoil to be placed in order to make a single island in exchange for a deed to this now one island and &quot;a case of whisky&quot;. The island&#x27;s name comes from when local fishermen started calling the island Jewfish Key because they caught large amounts of Goliath groupers or Jewfish there.

=== Water ===

A perennial problem for Longboaters was water quantity and quality. Salinity and sedimentary factors threatened the availability of potable water to island residents, visitors, and businesses. This problem was alleviated sufficiently when the Governing Board of the Southwest Florida Water Management District approved a connection to Sarasota County&#x27;s water supply, augmenting the existing connection to that of Manatee County.

Two of the members of the town commission under the town charter are elected for at-large seats.

The United States Postal Service operates a post office on Longboat Key, with the entire island having the ZIP code of 34228. The post office was established on October 10, 1907, as &quot;Longbeach&quot;, and was located in the community of that name on the north end of the key. On February 1, 1958, the name of the Longbeach post office was changed to Longboat Key. There was also another post office named &quot;Longboat&quot; established on March 27, 1914, in the Sarasota County portion of the key, but it was discontinued on January 14, 1922, and its functions were assumed by the Sarasota post office.

The quasi-governmental form of the condominium association exists in one of its most complex forms in and on Longboat Key, consisting of the Federation of Longboat Key Condominiums.

Longboat Key is served by two newspapers published year-round, the &quot;Longboat Observer&quot; and the &quot;Longboat Key News&quot;.

Currently, Longboat Key is located within two Florida counties, Manatee County in the north and Sarasota County in the south. There have been calls for the Florida Legislature to pursue an initiative to create a 68th county, &quot;Longboat Key County,&quot; to simplify governance of the island. Neither of these initiatives is likely to be passed, however. As of February 2019, Longboat Key officials had not started any comprehensive effort to put Longboat in one county or the other. Officials did, however, ask state legislators to request the Florida Legislature&#x27;s OPPAGA perform an analysis of the potential benefits and drawbacks of moving into only one county.

In recent years, it has been suggested to declare Longboat Key a national seashore, a public land operated by the National Park Service.

<text>Memphis is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Manatee County, Florida, United States. The population was 9,024 as of the 2020 census, up from 7,848 in 2010. It is part of the North Port–Bradenton–Sarasota, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
The community can trace its roots back to the 1880s, when it was planned as an 80-acre subdivision, adjacent to the city of Palmetto. Tennessee-born Robert Willis (1855-1933) originally owned the land, but eventually it was sold to I.E. Barwick (1854-1924) who subdivided it. The community&#x27;s traditional borders roughly lie on the west side of 16th Avenue East and just on the west side of U.S. 41, and between 17th and 25th Streets East. An 1897 Manatee County directory mentions a handful of establishments, from a clothing store to a crate mill and a bakery then under construction.

Over time, the area eventually became a predominantly African American community in the segregation era. The Old Memphis cemetery is the resting place of over 600 individuals. Many of the graves are of these early African American settlers, some of whom were freed slaves. The cemetery lies north of the community and was closed by the 1970s. Early residents included the Reverend Daniel and Isabel Baity. Reverend Baity became the first minister of the first African American church in Sarasota. The identity of the close-knit community was interrupted with the construction of U.S. 41 in the 1960s. In more recent years, the old cemetery fell into disrepair and was cleaned up on several occasions. An historical marker was erected in 2013 at the entrance of the Old Memphis cemetery.

==Geography==
Memphis is located in northern Manatee County at (27.539798, -82.562966). It is bordered to the south and west by the city of Palmetto and to the northwest by Terra Ceia Bay, an arm of Tampa Bay.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 11.29%, are water. The main road through the community is US Route 41, also known as the Tamiami Trail, which leads south to Bradenton, the county seat, and north to Tampa. US Route 19 has its southern terminus at US 41 in Memphis. US 19 leads northwest via the Sunshine Skyway Bridge over Tampa Bay to St. Petersburg, away.

<text>Palmetto is a city in Manatee County, Florida, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was listed as 13,323, up from 12,606 at the 2010 census. It is part of the North Port–Bradenton–Sarasota, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
A post office called Palmetto has been in operation since 1868. Samuel Sparks Lamb is considered the &quot;Father of Palmetto,&quot; having surveyed and plotted the city at its outset and donated several plots of land. He owned a general merchandise store in town. Samuel Sparks Lamb was from Clarke County, Mississippi, and arrived in the area near the Manatee River in 1868 establishing Palmetto. The city received its name from the palmetto trees near the original town site. Palmetto was first incorporated in May 1893 as a village, with its first mayor being P.S. Harlee. Palmetto was reincorporated as a city in 1897 and in the following years grew. In 1902 with the arrival of the railroad, the center of town moved from the waterfront to the Seaboard Air Line train station, served by the Sarasota Branch from Turkey Creek near Plant City through Palmetto to &quot;Bradentown&quot; and Sarasota. By 1921, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad was operating a Tampa Southern Railroad Branch from Tampa to Palmetto and &quot;Bradentown&quot;.

Compiled during the late 1930s and first published in 1939, the Federal Writers&#x27; Project&#x27;s Florida guide listed Palmetto&#x27;s population as 3,043 and described it as:

A dolomite mine existed in Palmetto on the Manatee River from the 1950s to 1974. Several failed attempts were made to redevelop the property. In 1974, the property was almost sold for residential development, but the company backed out due to the economic recession that was occurring. In 1978, a proposal was made to create a residential community on the site. The site&#x27;s master plan contained a nationwide motel chain with a restaurant, high-rise apartments along the Manatee River, single-family houses, and a shopping center built around a lake created from mining activities. The former dolomite mine site was bought by WC Riveria Partners. It was then redeveloped in 1998 as Riveria Dunes, a residential community with a marina, townhouses, and homes.

<doc id="109384" wikidata="Q2198641" url="?curid=109384" title="Samoset, Florida">
<text>Samoset is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Manatee County, Florida, United States. The population was 4,146 at the 2020 census, up from 3,854 in 2010. It is part of the North Port–Bradenton–Sarasota, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Samoset was incorporated as a city in September 1926, and had a reported population of 1,034. The name may have come from Samoset, an Algonquin Indian, but a newspaper article at the time reported that the township was named for a flag station of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. The new city&#x27;s seal consisted of an Indian head, a palm tree, and the year 1926, all surrounded by the name &quot;Samoset&quot; and Florida at the bottom. There were a few subdivisions that were developed before the incorporation, consisting of Listville, Hill Park, and Pinecrest, all of which were consolidated into the new city of Samoset. 

William A. Thomas built the new community&#x27;s first general store, a two-story brick building, in 1925. The original boundaries of the township ran south from the Bradenton city limits to present-day Cortez Road along 1st Street and a mile east of old Bradenton-Sarasota Road. The city of Manatee bordered it on the north, but it merged with Bradenton in 1944 and is now known as East Bradenton. Manatee&#x27;s original borders ran from 1st Street to Braden River.

Early pioneers Thomas, George, and Luke Wyatt, and Eva Felts secured the installation of power lines from Southern Power Company. Upon incorporation, R.R. Rodeman, a developer, was elected the town&#x27;s first mayor. G.L. Bryant was made city clerk, W.W. Fry town marshal, and Claud Schafer, George Wyatt, W.D. Thomas, C.A. Bingham, and E.F. Staples made up the city council. New mayor Rodeman was the developer of the above-mentioned subdivisions as well as that of Sunshine Ridge. Within days of the town&#x27;s incorporation, a group of 20 residents organized in a bid to dissolve the new incorporation, but the move failed. 

Meanwhile, a new school opened in October 1926, and had an enrollment of 30 children and was housed in the community hall. A teacher, Mrs. Charles Bingham, taught second and third grades. Another teacher, Mrs. Gladys La Croix, instructed 55 more children in the primary room (probably kindergarten and first grades). In March 1927, a post office opened and city clerk Joseph E. Bryant was made postmaster, and a stand-alone building was subsequently constructed. A new church, Missionary Baptist, was founded in May of that year and consisted of 20 parishioners.

In August 1927, Samoset residents&#x27; election was held, and S. Ed Curry succeeded outgoing mayor R.R. Rodeman, while J.M.Haynes and W.D. Thomas were elected to city council. In addition, E.B. Johnson was elected city clerk and F.A. Schmacher was marshal. In June 1928, another move to abolish the new town failed and the town continued on, until December when the move to abolish the town finally went through by a vote of 115 to 31. After the dissolution, the area returned to unincorporated, rural status.

<text>Whitfield, also known as Whitfield Estates, is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Manatee County, Florida, United States. As of the 2020 census it had a population of 2,989, up from 2,882 at the 2010 census. It is part of the North Port–Bradenton–Sarasota, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. It receives its mail from the Sarasota post office located in Sarasota County.

==History==
Whitfield Estates was formerly a wooded area that had been homesteaded by General John Riggin, aide-de-camp to Ulysses S. Grant. The property included the bayfront estate of Alfred Ringling. In 1924, the property was purchased from Richard T. Ringling, son of Alfred, by a corporation called Whitfield Estates, Inc., held by Louis Broughton Whitfield, D. G. Haley, E. H. Price, and E. S. Delaplane, Jr., all residents of Alabama.

Louis Whitfield, a native of Montgomery, Alabama, and president and primary investor of the development, was founder and president of the Alaga Syrup Company and the W. W. Pickle Company. Many streets in the subdivision were named for the Whitfield family, including Broughton and Pearl. The original plan for Whitfield Estates called for a housing development, an 18-hole golf course, hotel, yacht basin and man-made islands in the bay. Donald Ross was retained as the golf course architect. Sometime during late 1925 or very early into 1926, L. B. Whitfield would leave the development and his interest was taken over by Adair realty. In 1926, the developing neighborhood was incorporated as a city with E.S. Bond acting as mayor.

Like many other Florida Land Boom developments, it would never end up reaching the goals set by its developers. One of the first signs of financial trouble came when a decision was made to open membership of the Whitfield Estates County Club for residents of Sarasota and Bradenton if they agreed to take over the operating expenses associated with it. After the collapse of the boom, the residents of Whitfield would have difficulties staying there. Some homes would go through a series of different rentals while those that were under construction would end up being left unfinished for several years.

With the 1929 stock market crash and the arrival of the Great Depression, the conditions further worsened for residents there. During the years of the Great Depression there would be very little construction in Whitfield. In 1937 a group of club members ended up buying the golf course and club house, renaming it &quot;Sarasota Bay Country Club&quot;. It was renamed once again in 1938 to &quot;North Shore Country Club&quot;. During World War II, the club would close because of gasoline rationing and not being able to get golf balls. It ended up becoming overgrown, and after the war the US Army would help restore the golf course.

Whitfield Estates experienced a resurgence after World War II. Located near the Sarasota Army Airfield, the area became a popular location for families to settle during the post-war housing boom. This played a major role in the recovery of the community, with the Whitfield Community Improvement Association being established in the mid-1940s. The club was given its current name, &quot;Sara Bay Country Club&quot;, in 1964.

Dunnellon was founded in 1887, two years before the 1889 discovery of phosphate in the area. It was officially incorporated as a city in 1891.

One of the original mining pits is now called the &#x27;Blue Cove&#x27; subdivision. Phosphate industry operations began to shift south to the Polk County area, and by the 1960s, Dunnellon&#x27;s last mine closed. Dunnellon survived the bust period, unlike other nearby phosphate towns including Romeo, LeRoy, Brewster, and Parkersburg.

Areas in and around Dunnellon served as filming locations for the 2001 horror film &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot;, with a great deal of location work on Tiger Trail (a.k.a.

<text>Ocala ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Marion County, Florida, United States. Located in North Central Florida, the city&#x27;s population was 63,591 as of the 2020 census, up from 56,315 at the 2010 census and making it the 43rd-most populated city in Florida. Ocala is the principal city of the Ocala metropolitan area, which had a population of 375,908 in 2020.

Home to over 400 thoroughbred farms and training centers, Ocala is considered the &quot;Horse Capital of the World&quot;. Notable attractions include the Ocala National Forest, Silver Springs State Park, Rainbow Springs State Park, the College of Central Florida, and the World Equestrian Center.

==History==

Ocala is named after &quot;Ocale&quot; (also Cale, Etocale, and other variants) a Timucua village and chiefdom recorded in the 16th century, the name of which is believed to mean &quot;Big Hammock&quot; in the Timucua language. Another possible meaning of the name is &quot;song or singer of admiration or glorification&quot;. The Spaniard Hernando de Soto&#x27;s expedition recorded Ocale in 1539 during his exploration through what is today the southeastern United States. The site of Ocale has not been found, but historians believe it was located in southwestern Marion County, near the Withlacoochee River. References to Ocale, Olagale, and Etoquale occur in 16th and early 17th century sources, but do not specify a location. A Spanish mission named San Luis de Eloquale was established by 1630. Milanich believes the mission was near the Withlacoochee River. Eloquale is not named in a 1655 list of missions, and Ocale (and its variants) disappears from history.

In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Creek people and other Native Americans, and free and fugitive African Americans sought refuge in Florida. The Seminole people formed. After foreign colonial rule shifted between Spain and Great Britain and back again, in 1821 the United States acquired the territory of Florida. After warfare to the north, in 1827 the U.S. Army built Fort King near the present site of Ocala as a buffer between the Seminole, who had long occupied the area, and white settlers moving into the region. The fort was an important base during the Second Seminole War and later served in 1844 as the first courthouse for Marion County.

The modern city of Ocala, which was established in 1849, developed around the fort site. Greater Ocala is known as the &quot;Kingdom of the Sun&quot;. Plantations and other agricultural development dependent on slave labor were prevalent in the region. Ocala was an important center of citrus production until the Great Freeze of 1894–1895. During the Reconstruction era Ocala was represented by several African Americans in the Florida House of Representatives and on the local level.

Rail service reached Ocala in June 1881, encouraging economic development with greater access to markets for produce. Two years later, much of the Ocala downtown area was destroyed by fire on Thanksgiving Day, 1883. The city encouraged rebuilding with brick, granite and steel rather than lumber. By 1888, Ocala was known statewide as &quot;The Brick City&quot;.

In December 1890, the Farmers&#x27; Alliance and Industrial Union, a forerunner of the Populist Party, held its national convention in Ocala. At the convention, the Alliance adopted a platform that would become known as the &quot;Ocala Demands&quot;. This platform included abolition of national banks, promoting low-interest government loans, free and unlimited coinage of silver, reclamation of excess railroad lands by the government, a graduated income tax, and direct election of United States senators. Most of the &quot;Ocala Demands&quot; were to become part of the Populist Party platform. 

In the last decades of the twentieth century, the greater Ocala area had one of the highest growth rates in the country for a city its size.

===Ocala Historic District===
Many historic homes are preserved in Ocala&#x27;s large residential Historic District, designated in 1984. East Fort King Street features many excellent examples of Victorian architecture. Ocala structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places include the Coca-Cola Building, the E. C. Smith House, East Hall, the Marion Hotel, Mount Zion A.M.E. Church, the Ritz Historic Inn, and Union Train Station.

The original Fort King site was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 2004.

The long Ocklawaha River passes east of Ocala, flowing north from Central Florida until it joins the St. Johns River near Palatka.

Marion County is also home to the Ocala National Forest which was established in 1908 and is now the second largest national forest in the state. The Florida Trail, also known as the Florida National Scenic Trail, cuts through Ocala National Forest. Silver Springs State Park was formed as Silver River State Park in 1987, out of land the state purchased around the Silver Springs attraction to spare it from development.

==Culture==
Horses have a prominent role in Ocala&#x27;s cultural makeup. The first thoroughbred horse farm in Florida was developed in Marion County in 1943 by Carl G. Rose. Other farms were developed, making Ocala the center of a horse-breeding area. Local horses have won individual races of the Triple Crown series; in 1978, Affirmed, who was bred and trained in Marion County, won all three races, boosting interest in the industry there.

Ocala is one of only five cities (four in the US and one in France) permitted under Chamber of Commerce guidelines to use the title, &quot;Horse Capital of the World&quot;, based on annual revenue produced by the horse industry. 44,000 jobs are sustained by breeding, training, and related support of the equine industry, which generates over $2.2 billion in annual revenue. Postime Farms and Ocala serve as host to one of the largest horse shows in the country: H.I.T.S or &quot;Horses in the Sun&quot;, a Dressage/Jumper event lasting about two months. It generates some 6 to 7 million dollars for the local Marion County economy each year. The show features classes for over 100 different breeds, including Tennessee Walker, Paso Fino, Morgan horse, Saddlebred, Draft horse and the American Quarter Horse. Other equine events in the area include mounted shooting by the Florida Outlaws, as well as endurance rides, barrel races, extreme cowboy events, jumper shows, trick shows, parades, draft pulls, rodeo events and more. In 2022, Ocala was the site of the inaugural point-to-point Florida Steeplechase at the Florida Horse Park.

==Government and politics==
Ocala is governed by a five-member board of councillors and a mayor, all of which are elected on a nonpartisan basis.

The city manager handles most administrative and financial matters.

A number of county offices are housed at the McPherson Governmental Complex.

As of 2020, Republicans outnumber Democrats in Marion County, 112,000 to 80,000. In the 2008 presidential election, John McCain carried both the city and the county, the latter by a landslide, although Florida as a whole voted for Democrat Barack Obama by a narrow margin.

<doc id="109396" wikidata="Q2461671" url="?curid=109396" title="Hobe Sound, Florida">
<text>Hobe Sound is an unincorporated area and census-designated place (CDP) in Martin County, Florida, United States, located along Florida&#x27;s Treasure Coast. The population was 13,163 at the 2020 census, up from 11,521 in 2010.

==Geography==
Hobe Sound is located in southeastern Martin County at . It is an exurban area near the Atlantic Ocean, approximately north of West Palm Beach and southeast of Stuart. It stretches along the coast between Port Salerno to the north and Jonathan Dickinson State Park to the south. To the east, across South Jupiter Narrows, is Jupiter Island. Hobe Sound Public Beach, within the town of Jupiter Island, is one of Martin County&#x27;s four guarded beaches.

== History ==

Hobe Sound is the anglicized form of the name of a village of the Jaega, a Native American group that lived in the area before European settlement. The Spanish recorded the village name as &quot;Jobe&quot; or &quot;Jove&quot; . Jonathan Dickinson, whose party was shipwrecked near the town in 1696, spelled the name of the village &quot;Hoe-bey&quot;.

Parts of Hobe Sound were included in the Gomez grant given by Spain to Don Eusebio in 1815. In 1821, Gomez sold , including Jupiter Island, to Joseph Delespine for $1 per acre.

Shortly after the turn of the 20th century, Henry Flagler built his railroad along the east coast of Florida, passing through Hobe Sound. This gradually created many opportunities including jobs, the birth of tourism, and other related industries.
During the land boom of the 1920s elaborate plans were announced for Hobe Sound by the Olympia Improvement Corporation. Their goal was to create a town, in Greek style, where motion pictures could be produced. Street names bore such names as Zeus, Saturn, Mercury, Mars, Olympus, Venus, Pluto and Athena. For a brief time Hobe Sound was renamed &quot;Picture City&quot; and plans were presented for a movie picture production center. The boom collapsed after the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane, and the original name was restored. Street names remained, however, as did the cement streetlights along Dixie Highway.

In 1924, the building which soon would become the new schoolhouse in Hobe Sound was constructed. The Martin County Board of Public Instruction secured the use of the new school building from the Picture City Corporation in 1925, and in October of that year, the Olympia School opened. The school was designated the &quot;Picture City School&quot; of Martin County. It remained in use as a school until 1962.

Other mementos of the past are gone, including the ice plant, which was south of Bridge Road; the old train station, which now, refurbished and relocated west of Hobe Sound, serves as an office building for Becker Groves; and the Texaco station east of the Winn-Dixie plaza, which no longer supplies gasoline but continues to serve the community with car rentals and a livery service, operated by its founding family.

Hobe Sound is positioned at the southern end of environmentally-sensitive Martin (named after Governor Martin) County. It has been stated that at Hobe Sound&#x27;s front door lies the Gold Coast and that at her back door lies the Treasure Coast. Thus, Hobe Sound can lend to both while retaining its proud heritage and unique personality. Hobe Sound&#x27;s proximity to the coast affords immediate access to the Atlantic Ocean and the deep-channeled Intracoastal Waterway, a water route that provides a sheltered passage for boats along the eastern seaboard.

Another significant historical association possessed by Hobe Sound is the brief stay there of former Defense Secretary James Forrestal in 1949 between his resignation from that post and his death.

Around 1:30 a.m. on March 14, 1997, President Bill Clinton fell on the steps and twisted his knee at golfer Greg Norman&#x27;s 80-acre oceanside estate in Hobe Sound. Clinton was staying there to play in a golf tournament sponsored by Norman.
Hobe Sound is a predominantly wealthy community whose residents have included such celebrities and other prominent persons as Tiger Woods, Alan Jackson, Celine Dion, Burt Reynolds, and Marion Margery Scranton, among others. Over the decades, it was home or a winter home for wealthy businessman and industrialists, politicians, and sports and entertainment celebrities.

Police protection for Hobe Sound is provided by the Martin County Sheriff&#x27;s Department. The Martin County Fire Rescue Department provides modern fire, rescue, as well as EMS Services. State-of-the-art inter-facility EMS services are also provided by the Martin Health System.

==Counties==
Hobe Sound has been part of the following counties:
* St. Johns County, 1821-1824
* Mosquito County, now Orange County, 1824-1844
* Brevard County, 1844-1866. Note: The present-day Brevard County was known as St. Lucie County from 1844-1855, but it was not the same county as today&#x27;s St. Lucie County.

<text>Indiantown is a village in Martin County, Florida, United States. The population was 6,560 at the 2020 census. It is a rural community in the interior of Florida&#x27;s Treasure Coast region, first established in the early 1900s, then incorporated on December 31, 2017. The village is governed by a mayor and council elected at-large, while day-to-day operations are directed by the village manager.

==History==

Indiantown was originally established by the Seminole people as a trading post. Tribes fleeing southwards from the U.S. Army after the First Seminole War found the area an attractive place to settle due to a relatively higher elevation and ample hunting and fishing spots. It was then settled by white American migrants in the 1890s.

In 1924, Indiantown was transformed when S. Davies Warfield built an extension of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad from Coleman, Florida, to West Palm Beach, passing directly through—and stopping in—Indiantown.

Warfield planned to make Indiantown the southern hub of the Seaboard rail line. Toward that end, he planned a model city, laying out streets and building a school, housing, and a railroad station. Warfield also built the Seminole Inn, which is now on the National Register of Historic Places.
The Florida land boom of the 1920s fizzled out after 1926. Warfield died a year later, putting an end to plans to make Indiantown the Seaboard&#x27;s southern headquarters. The 1928 Okeechobee hurricane wreaked significant destruction and halted further development.

A serious effort to revitalize the local economy began in 1952 when the Indiantown Development Corporation was sold and restructured as the Indiantown Company. The company was involved in the construction of new water and sewage systems, housing developments, docks making use of the St. Lucie River, and a airstrip for bringing in small cargo and civilian air traffic.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Indiantown was home to the Circle T Ranch and its Circle T Rodeo Bowl. The 1963 rodeo event drew approximately 15,000 visitors, making it the largest tourist attraction in Florida at the time. The ranch was later bought out and turned into a filming studio.

Seaboard trains continued to stop at the Indiantown depot through the 1960s, but passenger service to the station was eliminated when Amtrak took over in 1971. The depot was demolished several years later. The Seminole Inn is virtually all that remains of the 1920s boom.

Warfield&#x27;s contributions to Indiantown are memorialized in, among others, Warfield Boulevard (the main route through Indiantown) and Warfield Elementary School.

Currently, the economy of Indiantown relies heavily on seasonal agriculture. The town also continues to make use of its position near the intersections of many major roads to act as a transportation and infrastructure hub. There are also attempts to take advantage of nearby natural wetlands and to revitalize the rodeo in order to draw in tourists.

<text>Jensen Beach is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Martin County, Florida, United States. The population was 12,652 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Port St. Lucie, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The history of Jensen Beach in the 19th century revolved around pineapple farming. John Laurence Jensen, an immigrant from Denmark, arrived in 1881, and set up his pineapple plantation, which became the town of Jensen.

By 1894, the Florida East Coast Railway reached Jensen Beach, and freight shipments were loaded directly onto the freight cars.

By 1895, Jensen was called the &quot;Pineapple Capital of the World&quot;, shipping over one million boxes of pineapples each year during the June and July season. To help handle the increased pineapple production, a pineapple factory was built, but a hard freeze in 1895 devastated most of the small pineapple plantations. Two fires, in 1908 and 1910, destroyed most of Jensen Beach and its remaining pineapple farms. The industry finally collapsed in 1920 due to a wide variety of financial and agriculture problems. Growers decided to turn their efforts in another direction: raising citrus fruits. The pineapple has become a symbol of Jensen Beach. The fruit legacy is celebrated annually during the Jensen Beach Pineapple Festival.

Jensen Beach was incorporated as &quot;Jensen&quot; in 1926 during the Florida Land Boom, but was dissolved seven years later by the State of Florida in 1933 following the onset of the Great Depression. The town&#x27;s name was officially changed to &quot;Jensen Beach&quot; by Martin County in 1943.

In the second half of the 1900s, Saint Joseph College of Florida and later the Florida Institute of Technology both located on the Mansion at Tuckahoe premises in Jensen Beach.

In 2004 Jensen Beach was hit by two hurricanes. On September 5, 2004, Hurricane Frances made landfall at Hutchinson Island with winds of . On September 25, 2004, Hurricane Jeanne made landfall on Hutchinson Island with winds of .

==Ecology==
Jensen Beach is known in the marine biology community for being a location for sea turtles to nest.

Designated sections of the Jensen Sea Turtle Beach are barricaded off in order to protect the nests of the sea turtles. The three species found on this beach are the loggerhead, leatherback turtle and green sea turtle. Loggerhead nests are the most common type found on this and adjacent beaches. Locations of the sea turtles&#x27; nests are marked with the approximate date in which the eggs were laid and the expected date in which the eggs will hatch. These notifications are meant to discourage tourists and residents from visiting the beach in the evening hours during these time periods. Efforts are made to protect both species of sea turtles since nests have been declining in recent years due to the severe erosion of the beach.

<text>Port Salerno is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Martin County, Florida, United States. The population was 10,401 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Port St. Lucie Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Port Salerno is located in eastern Martin County at (27.144090, -80.191765). It is bordered to the north by the St. Lucie River and Indian River Lagoon, to the east by one of its branches, known as Great Pocket, to the northwest by Manatee Pocket, and to the southwest by U.S. Route 1. It is southeast of Stuart, the county seat, and northwest of Hobe Sound.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Port Salerno CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 12.38%, are water.

==History==
In the 1920s, a small settlement was created in the southern shores of St. Lucie river inlet. It was named &quot;Salerno&quot; because of its visual resemblance to the Italian city of Salerno as observed by an early visitor. Early settlers were fisherman who lived along the banks of the Manatee Pocket, a small natural bay in the St. Lucie River. Some descendants of these original settlers remain in the area, with some families owning land for over 100 years.

The area increased in population and importance after World War II, with many people from the northeastern United States moving to Florida. In 1960, the name was changed to &quot;Port Salerno&quot;, in order to differentiate it from that of the Italian city.

The 1967 film &quot;Gentle Giant&quot; was partially filmed in and around Port Salerno. The only grocery store in town was P.O. Smith&#x27;s Grocery, which was housed in a small wooden building at the intersection of Snake Road (later renamed Salerno Road) and Route A1A. This grocery store was featured in the production in Palm Beach Gardens, but had been transformed into a saloon before being filmed. This was because the grocery store had swinging &quot;saloon style&quot; doors.

In the 1970s, the Manatee Hotel was transformed into the Manatee Resort upon purchase by Michael Reynolds, heir to the R. J. Reynolds tobacco fortune. Sally Field mentioned the town and resort in an interview with Johnny Carson on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

In the 1980s, the Chastain Campus of Indian River State College was established. Port Salerno is known for their &quot;World Fishing Tournaments&quot;, based on the yacht port.

==Government==
Port Salerno is an unincorporated town located in Martin County, governed by County Commissioners. Martin County is divided into five districts. Port Salerno is represented by Sarah Heard as part of District 4.

==Public transportation==

<text>Stuart is a city in and the county seat of Martin County, Florida, United States. Located in southeastern Florida, Stuart is the largest of five incorporated municipalities in Martin County. The population is 17,425 according to the 2020 U.S. census. Stuart is the 126th largest city in Florida based on official 2019 estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau. It is part of the Port St. Lucie, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Stuart is frequently cited as one of the best small towns to visit in the U.S., in large part because of its proximity to the St. Lucie River, Indian River Lagoon, and the Atlantic Ocean.

==History==
In the 18th century, several Spanish galleons were shipwrecked in the Martin County area of Florida&#x27;s Treasure Coast. The multiple wrecks were reportedly the result of a hurricane, and the ships were carrying unknown quantities of gold and silver. Some of this treasure has since been recovered, and its presence resulted in the region&#x27;s name. In 1832, pirate Pedro Gilbert, who often used a sandbar off the coast as a lure to unsuspecting prey, chased and caught the &quot;Mexican&quot;, a U.S. merchant ship. Although he attempted to burn the ship and kill the crew, they survived to report the incident, ultimately resulting in the capture and execution of Gilbert and his crew. The bar from which he lured his intended booty is named &quot;Gilbert&#x27;s Bar&quot; on nautical charts.

The Treasure Coast area that became Stuart was first settled by non-Native Americans in 1870. In 1875, a United States Lifesaving Station was established on Hutchinson Island, near Stuart. Today, the station is known as Gilbert&#x27;s Bar House of Refuge and is on the National Register of Historic Places.

From 1893 to 1895, the area was called Potsdam. This name was chosen by Otto Stypmann, a local landowner originally 
from Potsdam, Germany. Stypmann, with his brother Ernest, owned the land that would become downtown Stuart. Henry Flagler&#x27;s Florida East Coast Railway connected the area to Daytona Beach in 1892 and Miami in 1896.

Potsdam was renamed Stuart in 1895, in honor of Homer Hine (Jack) Stuart Jr., a local landowner who owned 160 acres around the railway station. Rue, Luckhardt, Krueger, Crary, and Armellinis were some of the prominent settler families.

When Stuart was incorporated as a town in 1914, it was located in Palm Beach County. In 1925, Stuart was chartered as a city and named the county seat of the newly created Martin County.

The City of Stuart formally adopted the slogan &quot;Sailfish Capital of the World&quot; in 1957, following pressure from the Stuart Chamber of Commerce, owing to the many sailfish found in the ocean off Martin County. The slogan is still used by the city.

From 1871 to 2005, 19 hurricanes passed through Stuart, including Isbell (1964), Frances (2004), Jeanne (2004), and Wilma (2005).

<doc id="109409" wikidata="Q790541" url="?curid=109409" title="Aventura, Florida">
<text>Aventura is a planned suburban city in northeastern Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States, north of Miami and part of the Miami metropolitan area. The city is especially known for Aventura Mall, the third largest mall in the United States by total square feet of retail space and the largest mall in Florida.

The city name is from the Spanish word for &quot;adventure&quot;, and was named &quot;Aventura&quot; after the developers of the original group of condominiums in the area, Eddie Lewis and Don Soffer, who had remarked &quot;What an adventure this is going to be.&quot;

As of the 2020 census, the city population was 40,242, up from 35,762 in 2010.

==History==
Initially referred to as &quot;Turnberry&quot;, Aventura began to be developed during the early 1970s and became an incorporated city in 1995. The Aventura Police Department was formed in 1997.

The city is home to the luxury resort Turnberry Isle, where the yacht &quot;Monkey Business&quot; was docked during the Gary Hart/Donna Rice incident, which contributed to Hart&#x27;s ending his 1988 bid for the presidency.

Aventura is also home to the Aventura Mall, the third-largest shopping mall in the US. Built in 1983, it is a joint venture of Turnberry Associates and Simon Property, and brings a major source of income to the city.

In early 2001, former US President Bill Clinton delivered one of his first speeches after leaving the White House at Aventura-Turnberry Jewish Center.

==Geography and climate==
===Geography===
Aventura is located in northeastern Miami–Dade County at . It is bordered to the east by Golden Beach and Sunny Isles Beach, to the south by North Miami Beach, and to the west by unincorporated Ojus. It is bordered to the north by Hallandale Beach in Broward County. U.S. Route 1 (Biscayne Boulevard) runs along the western edge of the city, leading south to Downtown Miami and north to Fort Lauderdale.

===Climate===
Aventura has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Am&quot;) with hot and humid summers and short, warm winters, with a marked drier season in the winter. The city sees most of its rain in the summer (wet season) and is mainly dry in winter (dry season). The wet season, which is hot and humid, lasts from May to September, when it gives way to the dry season, which features mild temperatures with some invasions of colder air, which is when the little winter rainfall occurs-with the passing of a front. The hurricane season largely coincides with the wet season.

In addition to its sea-level elevation, coastal location and position just north of the Tropic of Cancer, the area owes its warm, humid climate to the Gulf Stream, which moderates climate year-round. A typical summer day does not see temperatures below . Temperatures in the high 80s to low 90s (30–35 °C) accompanied by high humidity are often relieved by afternoon thunderstorms or a sea breeze that develops off the Atlantic Ocean, which then allow lower temperatures, although conditions still remain very muggy. During winter, humidity is significantly lower, allowing for cooler weather to develop. Average minimum temperatures during that time are around , rarely dipping below , and the equivalent maxima usually around .

Hurricane season begins June 1 and is officially over November 30. Aventura was severely hit by Hurricane Wilma on October 24, 2005, and was still undergoing recovery as of November 2011. The library was destroyed and has been rebuilt. Terraces flew off of high-rises and condos on high floors were flooded with many of their walls exploding into next-door apartments and adjacent hallways. Countless high-rise windows exploded and electricity stopped.

==Transportation==


Aventura&#x27;s partnership with Freebee offers free, on-demand, electric ride-sharing for anyone who wants to get around the city. The service runs from 7:00 AM to 11:00 PM everyday except Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years Day.

The Aventura Express shuttle bus is a city-run public bus service, free to anyone in Aventura. The service runs three routes (North, Central, and South). Miami-Dade Transit&#x27;s Metrobus and Broward County Transit bus systems also run through the city. Metrobus provide connections to Metrorail and Metromover at Government Center via Biscayne Boulevard/US 1. Over the last 30 years, travel infrastructure in Aventura has been heavily funded and influenced by developers of the many highrise condominium projects near the beach. Efforts to mitigate traffic impacts associated with increased travel demand to and from these projects led to the majority of principal road, bridge and structure designed primarily to accommodate automobile travel. This, coupled with single-use zoning and a general lack of connectivity for pedestrians, cyclists and similar modes has contributed to heavy traffic congestion on and near Biscayne Boulevard (US 1), despite this highway having up to ten travel lanes at points. Moreover, costly road improvements have not effectively mitigated traffic increases. A grade separation at the intersection of Ives Dairy Road and Biscayne Boulevard was constructed to facilitate westbound travel leading to Interstate 95 and free flowing eastbound right turns, but traffic signal phasing of the remaining approaches was unchanged, and the intersection continued to experience regular long queues.

The main north–south road in the city is Biscayne Boulevard (US 1), and the main east–west route is the William H. Lehman Causeway. Although no interstates run through the city, I-95 is to the west, with access from Exit 16 (Ives Dairy Road).

Brightline is an inter-city rail service operating between Miami and Orlando. The Aventura station, located adjacent to the Aventura Mall, provides service along the route.

Tri-Rail commuter rail service has also been proposed to run on the FEC line. Another proposal would extend the Miami Metrorail along the US 1 corridor from Downtown Miami to the Broward County line, which would pass through Aventura and Hallandale Beach.

The most famous shopping attraction is Aventura Mall, a indoor shopping center. The outdoor malls are &quot;Aventura Town Center&quot;, &quot;Aventura Shopping Center&quot;, &quot;Aventura Commons&quot;, &quot;The Promenade Shops&quot;, and &quot;The Shoppes at the Waterways&quot;.

The city also has its own exclusive parks and recreation department which operate Founders Park, Founders Park Bayside, Waterways Park, Waterways Dog Park, Veterans Park, The Community Recreation Center, and the Aventura Arts and Cultural Center (AACC).

At the geographical center of Aventura is the Turnberry Golf Course, encircled by Aventura&#x27;s Country Club Drive. The Turnberry Golf Course is a three-mile walking/jogging paved promenade which overlooks a multi million-dollar horticultural exhibit, lakes, opulent residential high rises, yachts and the Atlantic Ocean.

==Education==
Aventura is served by the Miami-Dade County Public Schools (MDCPS) system. Aventura Waterways K–8 Center serves as the public K–8 school of MDCPS which serves Aventura. The school is outside of the city limits but all children that live in Aventura are in the boundary for that school. Dr. Michael Krop High School in Ives Estates is currently the sole MDCPS high school serving North Miami-Dade County residents, including those of Aventura. Krop is considered to be a magnet school because it has a &quot;Students Training in the Arts Repertory (STAR)&quot; program, and has a total student body population of 2,833.

There are also charter schools established with sponsorship from the municipal government, Aventura City of Excellence School (ACES), a K–8 school. It was for years the only public school within the City of Aventura. It is operated by a private charter school company called Charter Schools USA. Built and opened in 2003, ACES was ranked in the top 10 of all schools in Florida in 2006. Construction on the Don Soffer Aventura High School, the other charter school, began in 2018. Opened in August 2019, the Charter School initially accepted ninth grade students in its first year and added grades 10 through 12 in subsequent years.

The Northeast Branch of the Miami-Dade Public Library System serves Aventura as a means of accessing information for all education alike.
Regional universities and higher education institutions include:
* Florida International University: Biscayne Bay Campus (North Miami)

==Media==
&quot;Aventura News&quot; is Aventura&#x27;s own newspaper, which is published weekly and is part of the Miami Community Newspapers, &quot;The Voice of the Community.&quot; Aventura is served by the for local radio and television. The city has a magazine named &quot;Aventura Magazine&quot; and is served by &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; and &quot;El Nuevo Herald&quot;.

In 2022, Aventura became the first city in Florida to offer the opportunity for the public to text its city government. The city monitors the text messages and responds to questions and concerns.

<text>Bal Harbour is a village in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The village is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. The population was 3,093 at the 2020 US Census.

==History==

Since the 1920s, the Detroit-based Miami Beach Heights Corporation—headed by industrialists Robert C. Graham, Walter O. Briggs, and Carl G. Fisher—owned of undeveloped, partially swampy land that stretched from the bay to the Atlantic. Graham assumed the duties as the developer for Bal Harbour. In the 1930s, city planners Harland Bartholomew &amp; Associates were called in to design the village. The company made several plans, and they were submitted to the Miami Beach Heights for review.

The original name chosen for Bal Harbour was Bay Harbour. However, the planning committee didn&#x27;t think that was appropriate for a city that was on the beach. A name was invented to encompass a village that ran from the bay to the Atlantic Ocean. The &quot;b&quot; was taken from the word &quot;bay&quot; and the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;l&quot; were taken from the name Atlantic. Hence the word &quot;Bal&quot; was created.

In 1940, World War II began, and the plans were put on hold. As a goodwill gesture to the government, Robert C. Graham rented the land to the United States Air Corps for $1 per year. The Air Corps used this land to train their soldiers and established a Prisoner of War camp. The ocean front area was used as a rifle range and the barracks were set up on the west side of Collins Avenue. The camp for prisoners was located on the site of what would become the Bal Harbour Shops.

After the war ended, the Air Corps left the barracks buildings intact, which were converted into apartment homes by Graham in 1946.

In order to incorporate a city in 1946, there had to be at least 25 male registered voters residing in the area. Graham had twenty five families move into the apartment homes that he had converted in order to qualify the Village for incorporation. He then hired Willard Webb, a Miami Beach tax assessor, to draft a charter for the Village. After the charter was completed, the Village of Bal Harbour was incorporated on August 14, 1946, by Graham and 25 male registered voters. The Village was operated under the city manager form of government.

The council established a volunteer fire department.

Swampland was filled, sea walls were constructed and the yacht basin was created. Contracts were signed for the sewer systems, water pumping stations and utilities. Bal Harbour was the first planned community in Florida to have its utilities placed underground. Developers set guidelines for the development of the beachfront and the residential areas. Collins Avenue was paved into four lanes with a landscaped median and later widened to the present day six lanes. Village plans indicated that ocean front property was to be deep and lots approached $100,000. Lots in the residential area were about and cost from $6,500 to $20,000.

The first hotel, &quot;The Kenilworth By-the-Sea&quot;, was built by Tom Raffington and made famous by Arthur Godfrey. It has since been demolished and is now the Kenilworth Condominium. The first home was built at 160 Bal Cross Drive by Robert C. Graham Jr., who was the son of Bal Harbour Developer Robert C. Graham. Construction for the Sea View Hotel was started.

Bal Harbour Village was re-incorporated by a special act of the 1947 Florida Legislature and its own charter was issued June 16.

<text>Brownsville (also known as Brown Sub) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) that is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. As of the 2020 US census, the population was 16,583, up from 15,313 in 2010. After three decades of population loss, Brownsville gained population for the first time in over 40 years in the 2010 US Census.

==History==
Brownsville was originally a settlement for white families in the 1920s. Black families began moving into the neighborhood between the late 1940s and early 1960s as the population surrounding nearby Liberty Square expanded and many inner-city whites moved to newly built suburban subdivisions surrounding Miami city proper in the wake of World War II.

In 1945, two black couples who lived in Brownsville were arrested and jailed for allegedly mishandling their garbage disposal. That same year, members of the Ku Klux Klan burned crosses in lawns and marched against black home ownership in the area.

By the mid-1960s, Brownsville was a thriving community for black professionals. However, the wake of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 that outlawed restrictive covenants, and riots in 1968 and 1980 brought about the black flight of middle and upper-class families from the community. Brownsville experienced continued population loss from 1970 until 2000, as part of a greater suburbanization trend among the U.S. upwardly-mobile middle class. Between 2000 and 2010, Brownsville gained population for the first time in over 40 years, rising to 15,313 residents.

Construction began on a transit-oriented development, &quot;Brownsville Transit Village&quot;, in 2010, on the site of the Brownsville Metrorail station parking lot. The project cost $100 million to build, and is composed of 467 units in five high-rise residential towers with ground-floor retail centered around the Brownsville Metro station. The project was partially funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and is one of the largest transit-oriented and affordable housing projects in Miami.

==Geography==
Brownsville is located northwest of downtown Miami at (25.821275, -80.240220). It is bordered to the east and southeast by the city of Miami, to the north by unincorporated Gladeview, to the west by the city of Hialeah, and to the south by unincorporated Miami-Dade County.

<text>Coral Gables is a city in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. The city is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida and is located southwest of Downtown Miami. As of the 2020 U.S. census, it had a population of 49,248.

Coral Gables is known globally due to being home to the University of Miami, a private research university whose main campus spans in the city. With 16,479 faculty and staff as of 2021, the University of Miami is the largest employer in Coral Gables and second-largest employer in all of Miami-Dade County.

The city is a Mediterranean-themed planned community known for its historic and affluent character reinforced by its strict zoning, popular landmarks, and tourist sights.
== History ==

Coral Gables was formally incorporated as a city on April 29, 1925. It was and remains a planned community based on the popular early twentieth century City Beautiful Movement and is known for its strict zoning regulations. The city was developed by George Merrick, a real estate developer from Pennsylvania, during the Florida land boom of the 1920s. The city&#x27;s architecture is almost entirely Mediterranean Revival style, mandated in the original plan, with an emphasis on Spanish influence in particular, such as the Coral Gables Congregational Church, donated by Merrick. The domed Catholic Church of the Little Flower was built somewhat later, in a similar Spanish Renaissance style. 

Early in the city&#x27;s planning and development, Merrick shared his vision for Coral Gables as &quot;a most extraordinary opportunity for the building of &#x27;Castles in Spain&#x27;,&quot; according to Coral Gables historian Arva Moore Parks. Merrick&#x27;s success in executing this vision for the city would catch the attention of Spain&#x27;s King, Alfonso XIII, who awarded Merrick the Order of Isabella the Catholic for his support of Spanish culture in Coral Gables.

By 1926, the city covered and had netted $150 million in sales, with over $100 million spent on development. That year also saw the opening of the Biltmore Hotel and Golf Course, a major landmark in city.

Merrick meticulously designed the city with distinct zones. For example, he designed the Downtown commercial district to be only four blocks wide and more than long. The main artery, now known as Miracle Mile, bisected the business district. Merrick could boast that every business in Coral Gables was less than a two-block walk. The city used to have an electric trolley system, which was ended as a result of the growing usage of automobiles, but now a new free circulator trolley system, initiated in November 2003, runs down Ponce de León Boulevard. Another distinctive and character-defining feature of the city planned by Merrick are the themed Coral Gables Villages that date to the 1920s and were designed to expand the city&#x27;s architecture beyond Spanish influence to include Italian, French, and Dutch South African among others.

In 1925, roughly simultaneous to the founding of Coral Gables, the University of Miami was constructed on of land just west of U.S. Route 1, approximately two miles south of Downtown Coral Gables. By the fall of 1926, the first class of 372 students enrolled at the university.

During World War II, many Navy pilots and mechanics were trained and housed in Coral Gables.

Coral Gables has traditionally placed high priority on historic preservation. The city passed its first preservation ordinance in 1973 as many of its founding structures from the 1920s began to reach their 50th anniversaries. Further ordinances were enacted in the 1980s establishing the Historic Preservation Board and in the 1990s establishing the Historic Preservation Department, now called the Historical Resources &amp; Cultural Arts Department. As part of the city&#x27;s historic preservation program the Historical Resources Department is tasked with researching and identifying significant properties and local landmarks for listing in the Coral Gables Registry of Historic Places as well as on national historic registers. The department also reviews modifications to locally designated landmarks and initiates grant proposals. The Historic Preservation Board is a quasi-judicial body that votes on local landmark designations and other issues pertaining to the historic character of the city.

<text>Country Walk is a census-designated place (CDP) in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. The population was 16,951 at the 2020 census, up from 15,997 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Country Walk is located southwest of downtown Miami at (25.632332, -80.434956). It is bordered to the east by Three Lakes, to the south by Richmond West, to the west by farmland, and to the north by Miami Executive Airport. The community&#x27;s borders are Florida State Road 825 (SW 137th Avenue) to the east, State Road 992 (Coral Reef Drive) to the south, SW 162nd Avenue to the west, and SW 136th Street to the north.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which , or 1.53%, are water.

==History==
The Country Walk community was originally designed and built by the Disney-owned Arvida Corporation. Country Walk Arvida broke ground on the first homes in 1978 and construction finished in 1994.

In 1985, Janet Reno prosecuted the Country Walk case, allegedly an example of day-care sex-abuse hysteria. The Arvida Corp. paid settlements of over $5 million to alleged victims in this case.

In August 1992, Country Walk was severely destroyed by Hurricane Andrew. 90% of the 1,700 homes in Country Walk were destroyed. Following the hurricane, property owners filed lawsuits against the developer of Country Walk, Arvida for shoddy construction. In the subsequent years, the homes were slowly rebuilt. Unlike the destroyed homes which were made of wood frame construction, the new homes were rebuilt with concrete walls. Although many areas of Miami were heavily affected by Hurricane Andrew, Country Walk was one of the worst affected and remains a reminder of the hurricane&#x27;s extensive disaster in the CDP today.

<doc id="109420" wikidata="Q1872769" url="?curid=109420" title="Cutler, Florida">
<text>Cutler was a pioneer town in Miami-Dade County, Florida that existed from 1883 to 1915, when most of it was absorbed into the Charles Deering Estate. The area adjoining the western border of the estate later became the Cutler census-designated place (CDP) through the time of the 2000 census, after which it was incorporated into the Village of Palmetto Bay. The population was 17,390 at the 2000 census.

==History==
Originally called the Hunting Ground due to its long use for that purpose by Native American tribes, the area was part of the 36-square-mile survey township granted to Henry Perrine by the United States Congress in 1838. In 1864, John and Mary Addison arrived at the Hunting Ground from Manatee County and built a home. By the 1870s, the area was being called Addison&#x27;s Landing. In the early 1880s, Dr. William C. Cutler visited the area and subsequently purchased 600 acres. In 1882, Cutler persuaded his friend, William Fuzzard, to settle in the area, and in 1883, Fuzzard built a wooden two-story home. In 1884, Fuzzard, along with several other settlers, cut a path from his homestead to Coconut Grove, which eventually became Old Cutler Road. By the end of the year, the population had reached 75, and a post-office with the name &quot;Cutler&quot; was established near a wharf built at the northeastern part of the settlement.

In 1896, residents built the Cutler Schoolhouse. That same year, Samuel H. Richmond built a large, two-story balloon frame home known as the Richmond Cottage, which in 1899 was transformed into the area&#x27;s only inn. A factory, stores, and other buildings were located around the intersection of what is now S.W. 168th Street (Richmond Drive) and S.W. 72nd Avenue (then the location of Old Cutler Road). The post office was moved to the Brown &amp; Moody General Store. However, after the Florida East Coast Railway bypassed Cutler in 1903 for the new railroad town of Perrine miles west, the town fell into a decline as farmers and settlers left to be closer to the railroad. From 1914 to 1917, Charles Deering purchased most of the land in the area, subsuming it within his estate. Except for the Richmond Cottage, which Deering incorporated into his estate, all of the buildings in the town were torn down.

Suburban development slowly began to approach the boundaries of the Deering Estate in the 1960s. By the end of the 1970s, the area west of the Estate was almost fully developed and became the Cutler CDP. In 1986, after Charles Deering&#x27;s last surviving daughter died, the Estate was purchased by the State of Florida.

The Village of Palmetto Bay was incorporated on September 10, 2002, and took the territory formerly held by the Cutler CDP, as well as the eastern half of Perrine that had become the East Perrine CDP.

The former Burger King headquarters as of 2007 houses rental offices for several companies.

<doc id="109421" wikidata="Q1986600" url="?curid=109421" title="Cutler Bay, Florida">
<text>Cutler Bay is an incorporated town in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States, established in 2005. With a population of 45,425 as of the 2020 US census, it is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. Cutler Bay is the 9th most populous of the 34 municipalities that make up Miami&#x27;s urban core, and the 33rd most populous of the 163 municipalities.

==History==
The town was named after Dr. William Cutler of Massachusetts, who visited the area north of the community, around 1880, and encouraged others to settle in what became the pioneer community of Cutler.

The Charles Deering Estate, located in nearby Palmetto Bay, contains the Cutler Fossil Site where mammoths, saber-toothed tigers and California condors are among the many fossil records. The park holds archeological evidence of Native American habitation of the land 10,000 years ago. Tequesta burial mounds are also found there. The area called Cutler Ridge had been called the &quot;Hunting Ground&quot; by some of the earliest Caucasian settlers in the area, circa 1825.

In the early 1900s, the Florida East Coast Railway was extended south to Cutler, which was located near what is now the Charles Deering Estate. Cutler then served as the place where people settling in the undeveloped Homestead area went to get their supplies.

In 1992, Hurricane Andrew made landfall near Cutler Ridge. The storm left the area in &quot;almost total destruction&quot;. The dense vegetation near the shore and the dense subdivision development of the area are thought to have been factors which mitigated the extent of areas impacted by flood damage caused by Andrew. However, nearly every building suffered major damage from the wind, and the damage in Florida was estimated at $25 billion, the most expensive natural disaster in US history at the time.

In May 2002, the Cutler Bay Steering Committee company met to discuss the formation of a municipal advisory committee, where the committee would advise on the incorporation of the Cutler Ridge area into the city of Cutler Ridge. The decision to incorporate was spurred in part by the efforts to recover from Hurricane Andrew. The proposed incorporation boundaries included Southwest 184th Street on the north and Southwest 216th and 224th streets on the south. In addition, the west boundary would include Florida&#x27;s Turnpike, U.S. 1, Southwest 112th Avenue, and Biscayne Bay would serve as the east boundary.

In April 2005, the Charter committee members looked at over a dozen names for the city, ranging from &quot;Pine Ridge&quot; and &quot;Cutler Bay&quot; to just &quot;Cutler&quot;. They reduced the choices to &quot;Cutler Ridge&quot; and &quot;Old Cutler Bay&quot;. On November 9, 2005, voters approved the charter and chose the name &quot;Cutler Bay&quot; for the county&#x27;s 35th municipality, over &quot;Cutler Ridge&quot; by a vote of 1,920 to 1,403. In the months following the name change, many of those born and raised in the area that had been known as Cutler Ridge since the 1870s, refused to accept the new name.

==Geography==
The approximate coordinates for the Town of Cutler Bay is located at , just west of Biscayne Bay and southwest of downtown Miami.

The town&#x27;s northern border runs from SW 184th Street (Eureka Drive) east of US 1 to the coast. The southern border is SW 232nd Street, north of Black Point Marina, the largest public marina in the Miami area. The town&#x27;s boundaries include the northeast section of Biscayne National Park, areas formerly known as Cutler Ridge to the west, and the neighborhood and former CDP of Lakes by the Bay to the east. The town is bordered to the north by the village of Palmetto Bay, to the west by unincorporated South Miami Heights, and to the southwest by unincorporated Goulds.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town of Cutler Bay has a total area of . of it are land and of it (3.87%) are water.

Cutler Ridge, an ancient coral formation, stretches from south Miami, where it rises approximately above sea level, through the Cutler Bay area, at a height of , to Homestead, Florida, where it is about . Cutler Ridge has been incorporated into the hurricane emergency plans for the area as lands east of the ridge are subject to storm surge, but areas west of the ridge would generally be protected.

Due to Cutler Bay&#x27;s position in a flat, low-lying coastal wetland area on Biscayne Bay, the area is prone to flooding. During the rainy season, Cutler Bay&#x27;s many canals, channels, and lakes are frequently full of water, and the groundwater table also is full and close to the surface. Flood hazards include rainfall from tropical storms, hurricanes, and other heavy rain events.

==Government and infrastructure==
Cutler Bay is governed by a five-member Town Council and operates under a Council-Manager form of government. Three Council Members are elected to represent specific residential areas (Seats 1, 2 &amp; 3) and must reside in their respective area. The Mayor and the Vice Mayor may reside anywhere in the Town. Town Council elections are non-partisan. As the legislative body of the Town, the Town Council determines policy, adopts the annual budget and makes laws. The Miami-Dade Sheriff’s Office operates the South District Station in Cutler Bay.

In January 2006, Cutler Bay elected former Florida state legislator John F. Cosgrove as its first mayor. Mayor Cosgrove died on April 19, 2006, while vacationing in Zimbabwe. Vice Mayor Paul Vrooman assumed the position of Mayor. In November 2010, Edward P. MacDougall was elected Mayor from Vice Mayor. Prior to incorporation Edward MacDougall chaired the municipal charter committee which set the Town&#x27;s charter. In November 2014, Peggy Bell, who was one of the original Council Members when Cutler Bay was incorporated, was elected Mayor and served as Mayor until she reached her term limits in November 2018. Elected in November 2018, the current office of Mayor is held by former Council member Tim Meerbott.

The community bought an office building, Cutler Bay Town Center, circa 2010; in 2020 the building was about 33% occupied. The city government planned to make money by leasing space in the building, but buyers did not materialize. In 2020, with the support of many residents, the Town traded the building for of land, with the vision to transform it into a park and municipal complex.

<doc id="109422" wikidata="Q1784180" url="?curid=109422" title="Doral, Florida">
<text>Doral is a city in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. One of 34 municipalities in the county, it is located west of Miami International Airport and west of Downtown Miami. Doral occupies bordered on the west by the Ronald Reagan Turnpike and the Florida Everglades, on the north by the town of Medley, on the east by the Palmetto Expressway and on the south by the Dolphin Expressway and the city of Sweetwater. The city is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. As of the 2020 census, Doral had a population of 75,874, up from 45,704 in 2010.

Doral has operated under the mayor-council-manager form of government since incorporation. Policymaking and legislative authority are vested in a governing council consisting of the mayor and four other councilmembers. The council, which is elected at large, is responsible for passing ordinances and resolutions, adopting the annual budget, and appointing the city manager, city clerk and city attorney. The city manager is responsible for carrying out the council&#x27;s policies and ordinances, overseeing the government&#x27;s daily operations, and appointing the heads of various departments.

For a city of its size, Doral has many shops, financial institutions and businesses, especially importers and exporters, primarily because of its proximity to the airport. In 2008, Fortune Small Business and CNN Money ranked Doral 51st on a list of 100 cities with the best mix of business advantages and lifestyle appeal. The city was named a 2019 All-America City Award finalist and one of the &quot;Best Places to Live&quot; in 2018 by &quot;Money&quot; magazine.

==History==
In the late 1950s, real estate pioneers Alfred and Doris Kaskel purchased of swampland between Northwest 36 Street and Northwest 74 Street and from Northwest 79 Avenue to Northwest 117 Avenue for about $49,000, intending to build a golf course and hotel. In 1962, the Doral Country Club opened in western Dade County, featuring the blue, red, and par-3 golf courses, along with a hotel on Miami Beach. The &quot;Doral&quot; name is a combination of Doris and Alfred&#x27;s names. As Doral&#x27;s first structure, the Doral Hotel, and Country Club became the area&#x27;s hot spot: guests were transported from the beach to the country club for a day on the golf course.

In the second year of operations, the Kaskels hosted the first Doral Open Invitational, Florida&#x27;s major PGA event. Alfred offered $50,000 in prize money to attract well-known golfers and add credibility to the course. According to the South Florida Golf Foundation, at the time, only three other tournaments were held in Florida, offering a combined total of $65,000 prize money.

By the early 1980s, Doral experienced its first residential growth spurt, when Alfred&#x27;s and Doris&#x27; grandson Bill developed Doral Estates, followed by a joint venture with Lennar to build Doral Park. Both communities were named after the hotel, a trend that was to be repeated many more times. Although younger families started flooding the area, there were no stores, schools, or parks. Initially, most new homes were investment properties or second homes, but early full-time residents started coming together as a community.

From 1983 to 1985, Miami-Dade County imposed a building moratorium to protect the area&#x27;s water wells. Once the ban was lifted, Doral experienced tremendous growth. In 1989, Morgan Levy helped organize the West Dade Federation of Homeowner Associations to stand strong against proposals that threatened the community&#x27;s welfare. Thus, they secured a police station instead of a jail and convinced county officials to implement higher development standards and more lighting, roads, and landscaping.

In 1995, residents began lobbying for incorporation in earnest, dissatisfied with the high tax rate relative to the services they received, as well as unchecked growth. The county met the first attempt at incorporation with a year&#x27;s deferral. Some classified Doral as a &quot;donor community&quot;, meaning that the taxes paid were more than the cost of operations. With the deferral, incorporation efforts intensified even more. In 1996, the community elected its first community council: Jose &quot;Pepe&quot; Cancio Sr., Mario Pita, and Barbara B. Thomas were elected, and three other members were appointed. The council initially met once every month.

In 2002, Governor Jeb Bush appointed Cancio to fill the remainder of Miami-Dade Commissioner Miriam Alonso&#x27;s term of office. Doral residents hoped that his appointment would bring the community closer to incorporation, and their hopes were realized. Although Cancio endorsed Juan Carlos Bermudez, the City of Doral&#x27;s first elected Mayor, as his replacement on the Community Council, Bermudez declined the offer, ran for the seat, and was elected. At the time, Bermudez was president of One Doral, a civic organization formed to counteract the perceived influence of the West Dade Federation on the new Council. However, both One Doral and the West Dade Federation proved essential to the incorporation process.

In January 2003, following a seven-year battle, 85% of Doral&#x27;s voters voted in favor of incorporation. In June of the same year, 92% voted to accept the City Charter and elected their first Mayor and City Council.

The new City of Doral was named as an attractive location for entrepreneurs with an interest in the Latin America market. Mayor Luigi Boria, elected in November 2012, became the second Venezuelan-American mayor in the United States. He was replaced by Juan Carlos Bermudez who won a reelection bid in 2016. Mayor Bermudez was again reelected in November 2020 with 69.85% of votes for four more years to lead the community.

On December 13, 2022, during a run-off election, Doral voters made history by electing Doral&#x27;s first female Mayor, Christi Fraga, with 54.5% of the votes.

==Media==
&quot;Doral Community Newspapers&quot;, which is published bi-weekly and is part of Miami Community Newspapers, is one of the local publications in Doral. Another long-standing publication is &quot;Doral Family Journal&quot;, also publishing bi-weekly.

Two big media outlets have their headquarters in Doral: Univision Network/Fusion and CBS-owned &amp; operated affiliate WFOR-TV, Channel 4. Several studios and other TV operations work out of Doral. The Telemundo chain has a presence in the city, with one of its main office and production units located there.

<text>El Portal is a village in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. The name is derived from the Spanish term for &quot;the gate&quot;, after two wooden gates that once stood as a gateway to the village. El Portal was originally annexed into the city of Miami in 1925. With the arrival of the Great Depression, Miami gave up its jurisdiction, and El Portal was incorporated as its own village in 1937. The village is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population of El Portal was 1,986, down from 2,325 in 2010.

==History==
The Village of El Portal is a small, diverse enclave between Miami Shores and Miami. It was incorporated on December 6, 1937. The enclave was originally the capital of the Tequesta tribal area, and was visited by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés in the 1560s. Three small subdivisions (now neighborhoods)—Sherwood Forest, El Jardin (Spanish for &quot;The Garden&quot;), and El Portal—merged into the Village of El Portal. Its borders include 91st Street on the north, the Little River Canal on the south, Northeast Fifth Avenue on the east and Northwest Fifth Avenue on the west.

The village&#x27;s name is a Spanish term meaning &quot;the gate,&quot; referring to two huge wooden gates on Northeast Second Avenue that were taken down in the 1940s.

The village was designated as a bird sanctuary by the state for more than 50 years, which means that the birds and trees cannot be harmed in any way. A nature trail winds its way through the village. El Portal also boasts links to prehistoric Indian life at the Little River Mound, a four-foot-high, innocuous grassy knoll that is actually an ancient burial ground. The Little River Mound, located in the Sherwood Forest neighborhood, is the first archaeological site to be publicly recognized and preserved in Miami-Dade County.

<doc id="109425" wikidata="Q136474" url="?curid=109425" title="Fisher Island, Florida">
<text>Fisher Island is a census-designated place in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States, located on a barrier island of the same name. Since 2015, Fisher Island has the highest per capita income of any place in the United States. It is located in the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population was 561.

Named for automotive parts pioneer and beach real estate developer Carl G. Fisher, who once owned it, Fisher Island is three miles off the shore of mainland South Florida. No road or causeway connects to the island, which is only accessible by private boat, helicopter, or ferry. Once a one-family island home of the Vanderbilts, and later several other millionaires, it was sold for development in the 1960s. The property sat vacant for well over 15 years before development began for very limited and restrictive multi-family use.

==History==
Fisher Island was separated from the barrier island which became Miami Beach in 1905, when Government Cut was dredged across the northern end of the island. Construction of Fisher Island began in 1919 when Carl G. Fisher, a wealthy land developer originally from Indiana, purchased the property from businessman and real estate developer Dana A. Dorsey, South Florida&#x27;s first African-American millionaire. In 1925, William Kissam Vanderbilt II traded a luxury yacht to Fisher for ownership of the island.

After Vanderbilt died in 1944, ownership of the island passed to U.S. Steel heir Edward Moore. Moore died in the early 1950s, and Gar Wood, the millionaire inventor of hydraulic construction equipment, bought it. Wood, a speedboat enthusiast, kept the island a one-family retreat. In 1963, Wood sold to a development group that included local Key Biscayne millionaire Bebe Rebozo, Miami native and United States Senator George Smathers, and then former U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon, who had promised to leave politics. During his subsequent presidency from 1968 to 1973, and during the Watergate scandal, Nixon maintained a home on nearby Key Biscayne known as the &quot;Key Biscayne Whitehouse&quot; that was the former residence of Senator Smathers and next door to Rebozo, but none of the three ever resided on Fisher Island.

The Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science at the University of Miami maintained the Comparative Sedimentology Laboratory on Fisher Island from 1972 to 1990 under the leadership of Robert Ginsburg.

After years of legal battles and changes in ownership, further development on the island was finally started in the 1980s, with architecture matching the original 1920s Spanish style mansions. Although no longer a one-family island, in 2005, Fisher Island still remains somewhat inaccessible to the public and uninvited guests, and is as exclusive by modern standards as it was in the days of the Vanderbilts, providing similar refuge and retreat for its residents. The island contains mansions, a hotel, several apartment buildings, an observatory, and a private marina. Julia Roberts, Oprah Winfrey, and Mel Brooks are among the celebrities with homes on the island.

In 2005, the island attempted to incorporate as a town, but the Miami-Dade County Commission did not support this initiative.

===Controversies===
In 2006, the Service Employees International Union began organizing the workers on Fisher Island in preparation for a petition for recognition as those employees&#x27; bargaining representative. The campaign culminated on June 15, 2007, with a march to the mainland ferry terminal that ended with a worker&#x27;s arrest. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote an exposé on the situation. In the article, residents were portrayed as not caring about the welfare of the community, but residents disputed this characterization, insisting that the island included financially successful, compassionate people who had established several charitable activities on the island, provided health insurance to their employees and were involved in various arts organizations in the Miami-Dade area. The union argued that the wages provided by the island were too low for employees to care for their families and that the health insurance provided was out of the reach of most island employees.

===The Fisher Island bankruptcy case===
One of the last developable parcels of land on the island, a site approved for residential development facing the shipping channel that separates the island from Miami Beach, was for a number of years subject to a protracted legal battle between Inna Gudavadze, the widow of the late Georgian billionaire Badri Patarkatsishvili, and investors aligned with his distant relative and former business associate, Joseph Kay.

A judgment handed down by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida on October 16, 2013, upheld in the US a previous 2010 judgment from the Supreme Court of Gibraltar that comprehensively dismissed the &quot;wholly unconvincing&quot; case brought by Joseph Kay. The development then moved forward, under the supervision of Inna Gudavadze and the Patarkatsishvili family.

<text>Florida City is a city in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. It is the southernmost municipality in the South Florida metropolitan area. Florida City is primarily a Miami suburb and a major agricultural area. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 13,085, up from 11,245 in 2010.

The city lies to the south and west of, and is contiguous with, Homestead. Both cities suffered catastrophic damage in August 1992 when Hurricane Andrew struck South Florida.

The city originated as a land promotion named &quot;Detroit&quot;. There were no buildings in the area when the first thirty families arrived in 1910, and they had to stay in Homestead until their houses could be built. The name was changed to &quot;Florida City&quot; when the town incorporated in 1914. It has a small historic area, but much of the city is hotels and other tourist facilities.

The city is at the eastern end of the only road running through the Everglades National Park, which terminates at Flamingo. Florida City is the southernmost city in the United States which is not on an island. It is also the last stop on the mainland north of the Florida Keys. The southern terminus of the Homestead Extension of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike where it ends at its junction with U.S. 1 is located in Florida City. Homestead is immediately north and east of Florida City, and these two cities comprise the greater Homestead-Florida City area. Some of the notable unincorporated communities in the area are Redland, Leisure City, Naranja, and Princeton.

==Physiography and natural history==
Florida City is situated mostly atop a limestone ridge called the Miami Rock Ridge that extends south from present day North Miami Beach to a location in Everglades National Park. The ridge, consisting of Miami limestone, serves as the higher ground within the community. The ridge extended from northeast to southwest across the city. The old location of the Florida East Coast Railway track marks the approximate boundary of the location of the limestone ridge south of Davis Parkway. The range of elevation of the ridge is from 5 to 8 feet (1.5–2.4 meters) above sea level.

Before settlement, the ridge was vegetated by South Florida Slash Pine trees, which were alternatively known as Dade County Pine &quot;(Pinus elliottii var. densa)&quot;. (Remnants of these pines can be seen today in local parks and in Everglades National Park at the Long Pine Key picnic area.) These pine rocklands were crushed by equipment and converted to farmland during the 1900s. Tomatoes, squash, and other truck crops were grown in the area during the winter months and packed at the Florida City State Farmers&#x27; Market near Krome Avenue and Palm Drive, driving the local economy throughout the 1900s.

East of the natural ridge was a broad area of marshlands surrounding the area. Old timers of Florida City called these coastal glades the &quot;East Glade&quot;. This was an extension of Everglades that extended from areas west and south of Florida City to its east. East of the East Glade, marshlands gave way to mangrove swamp prior to reaching Biscayne Bay. Soils in the East Glade primarily consisted of a limey soil called Biscayne Marl.

Development schemes in the East Glade led to the construction of canals in the early 1900s. This led to a lowering of water tables. Although development the East Glade was not extensive prior to the 1980s, agricultural development did occur. Potatoes were the primary crop grown in the East Glade before the construction of extensive housing developments within the areas annexed by the City of Homestead in the late 1970s. Potatoes mostly were harvested from February to March.

Florida City was historically bisected by a slough. Sloughs commonly were found crossing the limestone ridge at a roughly perpendicular angle from Miami to Florida City. Florida City&#x27;s slough (officially called &quot;Long Slough&quot; or &quot;Long Glade Slough&quot;) entered the city near Redland Road and Lucy Street, and extended across the city to the southeast to a location near today&#x27;s NW 3rd Street and NW 3rd Avenue. East of this point, the slough entered the East Glade.

Long Slough was a slow flowing body of water that originated in the Everglades just south of the Miami Homestead General Aviation Airport. As canals were constructed in the 1900s, and especially the 1960s, the slough was drained and became a low valley in the limestone ridge. Roadways (such as Redland Road near West Homestead Elementary School, NW 6th Avenue north of Davis Parkway, and NW 3rd Avenue about fifty feet north of NW 3rd Street) had culverts constructed under them to allow water to pass through the slough. NW 4th Street east of NW 5th Avenue dead ended near the approximate location where a fictional NW 4th Avenue would intersect that street. During the late 1980s, the street was constructed to reach NW 3rd Avenue since water in the slough had been drained away. Eventually fill was added to the slough and it was destroyed.

Extensive filling operations were conducted in Long Slough near NW 3rd Avenue in the late 1970s. Fill was obtained as waste rock from a nearby rock cutting operation (utilizing Key Largo Limestone, a local coral rock) and was allowed to be dumped in the location by the landowners. Today, this portion of Long Slough serves as a housing development.

An additional natural feature existed along Davis Parkway, extending into the Florida City Camper Park. This feature was a live oak hammock. The understory of the hammock was cleared for the camper park, but much of the hammock remained undisturbed to the south of Davis Parkway and NW 1st Road before the late 1970s.

Florida City today serves as the southern terminus of the Homestead Extension of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike. Motels and eateries are located along US 1 before taking the highway south into the Florida Keys. Along with serving as the mainland entrance to the Florida Keys, Florida City also serves as the gateway to the main section of Everglades National Park.

<text>Fontainebleau (incorrectly spelled &quot;Fountainebleau&quot; in the 2000 census) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. The population was 59,870 during the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Fontainebleau is located west of downtown Miami at (25.770144, -80.345917). It is bordered to the west by the city of Sweetwater, to the north by the city of Doral, and to the south by unincorporated Westchester.

==History==
The neighborhood takes its name from the famed Miami Beach resort. In 1970, Ben Novack, the Fontainebleau&#x27;s original owner, grew jealous of Doris and Alfred Kaskel&#x27;s plans in Doral and wanted to create his own planned golf course, resort, and community. It was to be known as Fontainebleau Park. Novack, however, soon fell into financial problems (and the Fontainebleau Park would play a part in the hotel&#x27;s foreclosure in 1977). The company Trafalgar Developers would go on to develop the community under the &quot;Fontainebleau&quot; name, but no link to the famed hotel would ever be mentioned in promotional materials when the community opened in the 1970s.

The community of Fontainebleau Park itself was a collection of sub-divided villages around two 18-hole golf courses. (East and West course now closed and built upon). The original sales office for Trafalgar Development was located at what is now the Fontainebleau Office Park located at the main Fontainebleau Park entrance and West Flagler Street. Fontainebleau Park West&#x27;s sales office (west of N.W. 97th Avenue) was at what is now &quot;Soleil Condominiums&quot;. While the eastern half of the community was heavily designed for condominiums and apartments, the western portion of the community included &quot;Village Homes&quot;, single-family homes, &quot;Garden Homes&quot;, and townhomes.

<text>Hialeah ( ; ) is a city in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. With a population of 223,109 as of the 2020 census, Hialeah will be celebrating their centennial 100th year anniversary in 2025. Hialeah is the sixth-largest city in Florida. It is the second largest city by population in Miami-Dade County in the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida, which was home to an estimated 6,198,782 people at the 2018 census. It is located west-northwest of Miami, and is one of a few places in the county—others being Homestead, Miami Beach, Surfside, Bal Harbour, Sunny Isles Beach, and Golden Beach—to have its own street grid numbered separately from the rest of the county (which is otherwise based on Miami Avenue at Flagler Street in Downtown Miami, the county seat).

The city is notable for its high Hispanic proportion, which was 94% in 2020; this was the second-highest proportion of Hispanic Americans in the contiguous United States, and the highest proportion among incorporated communities outside of Puerto Rico. Hialeah also has the highest proportion of Cuban and Cuban-American residents of any city in the United States, at 84.1% of the population, making them a prominent feature of the city&#x27;s culture. In 2023, 89.5% of residents reported speaking Spanish at home, and the language is an important part of daily life in the city.

Hialeah is served by the Miami Metrorail at the Okeechobee, Hialeah, and Tri-Rail/Metrorail Transfer stations. The Okeechobee and Hialeah stations serve primarily as park-and-ride commuter stations for commuters and residents going into Downtown Miami, and the Tri-Rail station for Miami International Airport and north to West Palm Beach.

==History==

The city&#x27;s name is most commonly attributed to Muskogee origin, &quot;Haiyakpo&quot; (prairie) and &quot;hili&quot; (pretty) combining in &quot;Hialeah&quot; to mean &quot;pretty prairie&quot;. Alternatively, the word is of Seminole origin meaning &quot;Upland Prairie&quot;. The city is located upon a large prairie between Biscayne Bay and the Everglades.

This &quot;high prairie&quot; caught the eye of pioneer aviator Glenn Curtiss and Missouri cattleman James H. Bright in 1921. Together, they developed not only the town of Hialeah but also Hialeah Park Race Track. In 1921, the first plat was drawn up, and the town was named.

In the early &quot;Roaring &#x27;20s&quot;, Hialeah produced significant entertainment contributions. Sporting included the Spanish sport of jai alai and greyhound racing, and media included silent movies like D.W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;The White Rose&quot; which was made at the Miami Movie Studios located in Hialeah. However, the 1926 Miami hurricane brought many of these activities to an end.

In the years since its incorporation in 1925, many historical events and people have been associated with Hialeah. The opening of the horse racing course at Hialeah Park Race Track in 1925 (which was nicknamed the &quot;Grand Dame&quot;) received more coverage in the Miami media than any other sporting event in the history of Dade County up to that time and since then there have been countless horse racing histories played out at the world-famous park. It was considered one of the most grand thoroughbred horse racing parks with its majestic Mediterranean style architecture and was considered the Jewel of Hialeah at the time.

The park&#x27;s grandeur has attracted millions, included among them are names known around the world such as the Kennedy family, Harry Truman, General Omar Bradley, Winston Churchill, and J.P. Morgan. The Hialeah Park Race Track also holds the dual distinction of being an Audubon Bird Sanctuary due to its famous pink flamingos and being listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The famous aviator Amelia Earhart in 1937 said her final good-byes to the continental U.S. from Hialeah as she left on her ill-fated flight around the world in 1937.

While Hialeah was once envisioned as a playground for the elite, Cuban exiles fleeing Fidel Castro&#x27;s 1959 revolution, as well as World War II veterans and city planners, transformed the city into a working-class community. Hialeah historian Patricia Fernández-Kelly explained, &quot;It became an affordable Eden.&quot; She further describes the city as &quot;a place where different groups have left their imprint while trying to create a sample of what life should be like.&quot; Several waves of Cuban exiles, starting after the Cuban Revolution in 1959 and continuing through to the Freedom Flights from 1965 to 1973, the Mariel boatlift in 1980, and the Balseros or boat people of the late 1990s, created what at least one expert has considered the most economically successful immigrant enclave in U.S. history as Hialeah is the only American industrial city that continues to grow.

From a population of 1,500 in 1925, Hialeah has grown faster than most of the 10 larger cities in the state of Florida since the 1960s and holds the rank of Florida&#x27;s sixth-largest city, with more than 224,000 residents. The city is also one of the largest employers in Dade County.

In January 2009, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine listed Hialeah as one of the most “boring” (which Forbes defined by low media presence) cities in the United States.

The city of Hialeah is a commercial center in Miami-Dade County. The city is host to many national retailers.

Hialeah is also home to vibrant community of mom-and-pop stores. These shops have successfully competed against national name brand retailers, outfitters, and franchises. In order to remain competitive national businesses have altered their traditional business strategy to meet the demands of the local community. Supermarkets operate on the city&#x27;s main streets including those which cater to Latin American and Hispanic clientele.

While most of the manufacturing and cloth industries that made Hialeah an industrial city in the 1970s–1980s have disappeared, new electronics and technology businesses have reinvigorated the local economy. Westland Mall contains over 100 stores and several restaurants. Telemundo, the second largest Spanish-language TV network in the United States, was headquartered at 2340 West 8th Avenue in Hialeah until 2018.

In March 2009, it was announced that a $40–$90 million restoration project was set to begin within the year on the Hialeah Park Race Track. On May 7, 2009, the Florida legislature agreed to a deal with the Seminole Tribe of Florida that allowed Hialeah Park to operate slot machines and run Quarter Horse races. The historic racetrack reopened on November 28, 2009, but only for Quarter Horse races. The park installed slot machines in January 2010 as part of a deal to allow for two calendar seasons of racing. The races went on all the way until February 2, 2010. Only a portion of the park has been restored, and an additional $30 million will be needed to complete this first phase of the project. The full transformation is expected to cost $1 billion since the plan includes a complete redevelopment of the surrounding area including the construction of an entertainment complex to include a hotel, restaurants, casinos, stores and a theater. In June 2010 concerns were raised over the preservation of Hialeah Park&#x27;s historical status, as the planned development threatens to hurt Hialeah Park&#x27;s status as a National Historic Landmark.

It also houses the new Miami Watersports Complex, which offers cable and boat wakeboarding, waterskiing, wake surfing, kneeboarding and paddleboarding.

Starting in 2022 the city has worked on developing the &quot;Leah Arts district&quot; centered around the Factory Town concert venue including bars, music venues, and other entertainment themed businesses.

===Public library===
Hialeah&#x27;s public library was founded in 1924, one year prior to the incorporation of the city. While over the years the county-wide Miami-Dade Public Library System has taken over the libraries of most of the cities in the county, Hialeah public libraries function independently from the county-wide system.
The first branch was a donation by the Hialeah Women&#x27;s Club. It was actually located in the house of one of the Hialeah Women&#x27;s Club&#x27;s home. The home of Ms. J Sommers Garwood. The club was founded by Ms. Lua Adams Curtiss, who was the late mother of the famous aviator Glenn Curtiss. The club asked for donations to get the library started and was fortunate enough to receive enough to get the system started. The latest branch, John F. Kennedy Library is now the main library for Hialeah and is easily recognizable for its grand murals. In 2017, the branch set out to renovate the entire library and they added new furniture, the art murals, polished terrazzo floors, and new sculptures. The library hosts a print collection, digital resources, and a Hialeah History Collection which collects, preserves and provides access to information about the City of Hialeah&#x27;s history.

==Transportation==


In 2013, Hialeah was named a top five city with the worst drivers by &quot;Slate&quot; and Allstate.

===Rail===
Hialeah is served by Miami-Dade Transit along major thoroughfares by Metrobus, and by the Miami Metrorail, Tri-Rail, and Amtrak at:

Metrorail:
* Tri-Rail/Metrorail Transfer (North 79th Street and West 37th Avenue)
* Hialeah (East 21st Street and East 1st Avenue)
* Okeechobee (West 19th Street and South Okeechobee Road)

Tri-Rail:
* Tri-Rail/Metrorail Transfer (North 79th Street and West 37th Avenue)
* Hialeah Market (North 41st Street and West 38th Avenue)

Amtrak:
* Amtrak-Miami: &quot;Silver Star&quot; and &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; service (North 79th Street and West 37th Avenue)

===Road===
&quot;All Ways Lead to Hialeah&quot; was one of the city&#x27;s first slogans. At the time, Glenn Curtiss and James Bright could not have imagined the important link in the transportation chain provided by Hialeah&#x27;s location. Sitting in the heart of northwest Dade, Hialeah has access to several major thoroughfares, linked by:
* Interstate 75
* State Road 826 (Palmetto Expressway)
* Homestead Extension of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike
* U.S. Route 27 (Okeechobee Road)
* State Road 924 (Gratigny Parkway)
In November 2023, the Hialeah City Council voted to rename Palm Avenue as President Donald J. Trump Avenue, causing major controversy.
