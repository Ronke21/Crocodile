<text>Lyons is a city in and the county seat of Rice County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 3,611.

==History==

For millennia, the land now known as Kansas was inhabited by Native Americans.

Although Coronado&#x27;s exact route across the plains is uncertain and has been widely disputed, his men and he are thought to have camped near the present location of Lyons on their quest for &quot;Quivira&quot;, a Native American place that Indians to the southwest had told them was fabulously wealthy in gold.

West of Lyons is a cross commemorating Juan de Padilla, a member of Coronado&#x27;s expedition, who returned the following year as a missionary. He was killed in 1542 by Native Americans after establishing a church in the area, and is considered the first Christian martyr in North America.

In 1803, most of modern Kansas was secured by the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase.

Lyons Main Street (U.S. Highway 56) is based on the Santa Fe Trail.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1867, Rice County was founded.

Lyons was originally called Atlanta, and under the latter name was founded in 1870. It was renamed Lyons in 1876, in honor of Freeman J. Lyons.

In 1878, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and parties from Marion County and McPherson County chartered the Marion and McPherson Railway Company. In 1879, a branch line was built from Florence to McPherson, in 1880, it was extended to Lyons, and in 1881, it was extended to Ellinwood. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to Marion, was abandoned in 1968. In 1992, the line from Marion to McPherson was sold to Central Kansas Railway. In 1993, after heavy flood damage, the line from Marion to McPherson was abandoned. The original branch line connected Florence, Marion, Canada, Hillsboro, Lehigh, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Conway, Windom, Little River, Mitchell, Lyons, Chase, and Ellinwood.

Lyons was incorporated as a city in 1880, the same year the railroad was built through it.

In 1890, the Western Salt Company put down its first shaft to mine salt in Lyons.

Lyons was home to a minor league baseball team. The Lyons Lions team played from 1909 to 1913. Lyons teams played as members of the Class D level Kansas State League from 1909 to 1911, the Central Kansas League in 1912 and Kansas State League in 1913. The Lyons franchise permanently folded after the 1913 season.

In the 1970s, the federal government was interested in using a local site for the burial of high-level nuclear waste.

<text>Randolph is a city in Riley County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 159.

==History==
Randolph was originally called Waterville, and under the latter name was laid out in 1856. It was renamed Randolph in honor Gardner Randolph, a pioneer settler.

Randolph was originally located a mile east of its present location. When the Tuttle Creek reservoir began filling up in 1962, it affected ten towns and entirely submerged four of them (from north to south): Cleburne at , Randolph, Garrison Cross and Stockdale. The only town to rebuild elsewhere was Randolph, where the streets are named after the submerged towns.

The ruins of the original town are visible on the north side of Kansas Highway 16 as it crosses the lake. The downtown of the original settlement is above the waterline on an island in the marshes at the northern tip of the lake. The island is occasionally accessible by foot when Fancy Creek is low, but the channels of Fancy Creek and the Big Blue River shift frequently making access to the ruins unpredictable. This is locally known as &quot;Old Randolph.&quot;

<text>Palco is a city in Rooks County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 208.

==History==
Palco was established in 1888 by Union Pacific Railroad as a train depot on a newly formed line. The town was given the name Palco as a portmanteau for railroad officials Palmer and Cole.

The post office was moved from the nearby town of Cresson. Cresson (named for Cresson, Pennsylvania) was granted a post office in 1879. In 1887, rumors circulated that the railroad would lay track 1-1/2 miles to the south of Cresson. Many citizens and businesses abandoned Cresson to form the community of New Cresson along the expected railroad route. When the railroad track was laid it curved to the north missing New Cresson. The town was soon abandoned. An ironic twist is that the northern route of the track passed near the original town of Cresson.

In 1893, Palco was nearly wiped out by a prairie fire. The fire originated in Graham County and consumed thousands of acres along with farmsteads and livestock in Graham, Rooks, Ellis and Russell Counties before being extinguished. Seven people lost their lives in the blaze.

Palco filed for incorporation as a third class city in 1906 and elected Robert Kirkendall as mayor.

Fire again struck Palco in 1923, destroying many businesses along Main Street including the hotel, post office, real estate office and a doctor&#x27;s office.

<text>Plainville is a city in Rooks County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 1,746. It was named from its setting upon the plains.

==History==
Washington Irving Griffin settled along a freight trail in an area known as Paradise Flats in 1877. In order to establish a post office, Griffin completed a US Postal Service application that required the signature of the local Justice of the Peace. While reviewing the application, Justice of the Peace Lambert P. Darland suggested the name &quot;Plainville&quot;. Griffin operated the Plainville post office and a small store from his sod house, the first structure in what would become the city of Plainville.

In 1888, Plainville filed for incorporation with 500 residents. Dan E. Miller was elected the first mayor. The first city council consisted of Dr. Volney M. Gray, Murray C. Knox, John Mullin, George Brooks and David E. Mickey.

Union Pacific Railroad established an east–west route through Plainville in August 1888. The train tracks ran parallel to Mill Street, approximately one block to the north. The Train Depot was located on the northwest corner of N First Street and Meridian Street. A Roundhouse was located at N First Street and Madison Street.

Plainville Mill &amp; Elevator Co., (est. 1893) was a major employer and purchaser of locally grown wheat. The original mill was destroyed by fire in 1899 and soon replaced by a larger mill. The flour produced by the mill was of such fine quality, the company won a gold medal at the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair. The mill was again destroyed by fire in 1950. Plainville Mill &amp; Elevator Co. was located on N First Street between Madison and Meridian Streets.

In 1909, fire devastated the Plainville business district. The fire apparently started in a butcher shop on the south side of Mill Street in the early morning hours. Fire quickly spread to the north side of Mill Street. Seventeen structures were destroyed before the fire was contained. The burned out wooden buildings were replaced with stone and brick structures, many still standing on Mill Street today.

Oil was discovered in Rooks County in 1927. The oil boom brought significant growth to Plainville in the 1940s and 1950s. The Bemis-Shutts oil field in the Saline River valley south of Plainville is one of the largest oil producers in the state of Kansas.

<text>Alexander is a city in Rush County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 54.

==History==

===19th century===
Alexander is the oldest city in Rush County, Kansas. It was established in 1869 after becoming an important stopping point on the Fort Hays/Fort Dodge Trail (officially a part of the Santa Fe Trail). The name of the town originated from Alexander Harvey a Scottish emigrant who operated a stockaded trading post on the trail crossing of the Wet Walnut Creek. Harvey was a prominent and connected figure in western settlement. He was a friend of renown trapper, trader, and Indian Agent William Bent who established Bent&#x27;s Fort in Eastern Colorado. Harvey&#x27;s daughter Adaline at age 20 married the 60 year-old Bent.

In its early days, Alexander was a trading post for trappers, buffalo hunters, wild horse wranglers, and other early Westerners.

<text>Gorham is a city in Russell County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 376.

==History==
Beaten to the settlement of Wilson, Kansas by Bohemian colonists, Pennsylvania Dutch settlers from Philadelphia and Lancaster, Pennsylvania established a community on the Kansas Pacific Railway at the future site of Gorham in April 1872. Elijah Dodge Gorham, a settler from Illinois, gave the town its name when he platted it in 1879. Seeking to create a local trading center, he formally established the town in July 1886, gave land for a Catholic Church and cemetery, and started several businesses including a general store, grain elevator, post office, lumberyard, and a coal yard. Additional grain elevators and a stockyard subsequently opened, establishing Gorham as a farming community.

The discovery of oil deposits in Russell County transformed the local economy in the 1920s. Companies including Texaco, Stanolind, and Sohio started operations in the area, stimulating Gorham&#x27;s growth. A brick school building was built in 1922 followed by a second building in 1930 and another in 1949. Gorham incorporated as a city in 1941. By 1944, it had a diverse business community, two oil field production companies, and public schools. From the 1950s to the early 1980s, the city expanded further through the development of residential additions.

==Geography==

<text>Paradise is a city in Russell County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 35.

==History==
In 1859, a hunting party explored the area, including a small tributary of the Saline River which led them to a site abundant in water, timber, and bison. One of the hunters, James R. Mead, described the site as paradise, and the tributary subsequently became known as Paradise Creek. The first post office in the area opened under the name Paradise in 1875. In 1887, the Union Townsite Company established a town on the north side of the creek northwest of the post office, naming it Ivamar after Iva Marr, the daughter of a local rancher. The Paradise post office relocated to Ivamar the next year, but kept its name. As a result, the town came to be known by both names; in 1891, the Union Pacific Railroad listed its rail stop there as Paradise with Ivamar in parentheses. The community grew through the 1890s to include a school, downtown businesses, and railroad facilities, reaching a population of 200 by 1910. Ivamar incorporated in 1924 and finally changed its name to Paradise. The population of the community has gradually declined since the 1930s.

<text>Russell is the most populous city in and the county seat of Russell County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 4,401.

==History==
In 1865, the Butterfield Overland Despatch established a short-lived station named Fossil Creek Station along its route from Atchison, Kansas to Denver near the site of modern Russell. In 1867, the Kansas Pacific Railway reached the area and built its own station, also named Fossil Creek, later just Fossil, north of the Butterfield station. That same year, the Kansas Legislature established the surrounding area as Russell County. In 1871, colonists from Ripon, Wisconsin established a permanent settlement at Fossil Station, renaming it Russell after the county. Russell was incorporated and named the provisional county seat in 1872, and, after a two-year dispute with neighboring Bunker Hill, it became the permanent county seat in 1874. In 1876, Volga Germans, mostly from the area around Saratov and Samara in Russia, began settling in and around Russell.

The first discovery oil well in Russell County was drilled west of Russell in 1923. An oil boom ensued and lasted through the 1930s, attracting settlers from Oklahoma and Texas. Petroleum production became a staple of the local economy.

Russell came to national attention in the mid-1990s as the hometown of U.S. Senators Bob Dole and Arlen Specter when both men campaigned for the U.S. presidency. Dole was born and raised in Russell, and it remained his official place of residence throughout his political career.

==Geography==

<text>Salina is a city in and the county seat of Saline County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 46,889.

In the early 1800s, the Kanza tribal land reached eastward from the middle of the Kansas Territory. In 1858, settlers from Lawrence founded the Salina Town Company with a wagon circle, under constant threat of High Plains tribal attacks from the west. It was named for the salty Saline River. Saline County was soon organized around this township, and in 1870, Salina incorporated as a city.

As the westernmost town on the Smoky Hill Trail, Salina boomed until the Civil War by establishing itself as a trading post for westbound immigrants, gold prospectors bound for Pikes Peak, and area American Indian tribes. It boomed again from the 1940s-1950s when the Smoky Hill Army Airfield was built for World War II strategic bombers.

It is now a micropolis and regional trade center for North Central Kansas. Higher education institutions include the KSU College of Technology and Aviation and Kansas Wesleyan University; and employers include Tony&#x27;s Pizza, Exide Battery, Great Plains Manufacturing, and Asurion.

==History==
===Native inhabitance: up to 1800s===
Shortly prior to European colonization of the area in the early 1700s, the site that would become Salina was located within the western territory of the Kansa people. Claimed first by France as part of Louisiana and later acquired by the United States with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, it was within the area organized by the U.S. as Kansas Territory in 1854. The French traders who mapped the forks of &quot;les Grande Riviere des Cansez&quot;, located the western village of &quot;les Cansez&quot; at the general confluence of the Smoky Hill, Saline, and Solomon Rivers with villages of the Paducas tribe just to the west on heads of those streams.

By the time of exploration of the prairie by the United States following the Louisiana Purchase in the early 1800s, the Republican Pawnee had established its influence in the Smoky Hills, driving the Kansa to its northeastern Kansas settlements.

The United States established forts throughout the territory to provide security for established commercial trade trails, including the Smoky Hill Trail and the Santa Fe Trail. The Smoky Hill Trail passed through the Salina site where the Fort Riley/Fort Larned Road split off to cross the Smoky Hill River to the southwest.

===Battle of Indian Rock: 1857===
By the time of the first tentative settlements by United States citizens, the site was claimed as hunting grounds by the High Plains tribes of Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Sioux, which had expanded into the area, driving out the Pawnee. However, the Kansa continued to hunt in the area, in which they were joined by the Delaware and Potawatomi tribes which had been relocated by the U.S. Government near the Kansa&#x27;s reserve and assured of hunting access to the plains. The High Plains tribes were hostilely opposed to both the U.S. settlers in central Kansas and to the relocated tribes in Eastern Kansas and Nebraska, who they also regarded as settlers, and there were several raids in the Salina area in the 1850s. These Indian skirmishes repeatedly discouraged settlement of the Salina site until 1857, according to William A. Phillips who resided in Lawrence while scouting settlement locations.

In that year, Big Chief of the Cheyenne led a party of the High Plains tribes. At Spring Creek, 20 miles west of what became Salina, they made a surprise attack on a hunting party of the &quot;friendly&quot; Eastern tribes. The hunting party retreated to Dry Creek, trapped and sending for help from another Kaw hunting party from Council Grove. Big Chief forced them to flee further to a butte in a bend of the Smoky Hill River, where they were joined by the Kaw reinforcements with rifles. Firing rifles from the cover of large sandstone boulders atop the butte, the defenders killed Big Chief on the first of five offensive charge attempts. His attacking bow and arrow force was devastated, leaving bodies strewn, and effectively ending the local raids.

The aftermath was recalled by settler Christina Campbell: &quot;one of the fiercest and most cruel Indian battles known to white settlers; around were strewn thousands of arrows and implements of Indian warfare. Indian Rock, besmeared with blood, showed the part it played in repelling the repeated savages&#x27; attacks. It was here that the Cheyenne made their last attack.&quot;

===Founding: 1858–1870===

The defeat of the aggressive High Plains tribes had enabled the safe return of attempted settlers. In April 1858, journalist and lawyer William A. Phillips from Lawrence led the founding of Salina, accompanied by settlers David Phillips, Alexander M. Campbell Sr. (husband of Christina), A.C. Spillman, and James Muir. They were all Scotch Presbyterians, and all but Muir were related. From a west riverbank dugout at what is now Riverside Park, they camped and designed the first building. It was a two-story dwelling and Campbell&#x27;s store, at what is now the southwest corner of 5th St and Iron Ave near Founders Park. Constant tribal attacks required a wagon circle around the first water well one block west. The Campbells had the first surviving settler birth in the area, also named Christina.

That month, and still predating the 1861 statehood of Kansas, they chartered the Salina Town Company with the Kansas territory legislature. During the following year, they organized the surrounding area as Saline County, and named Salina the county seat. The westernmost town on the Smoky Hill Trail, Salina established itself as a trading post for westbound immigrants, gold prospectors bound for Pikes Peak, and area American Indian tribes. The town&#x27;s growth halted with the outbreak of the American Civil War when much of the male population left to join the Union Army.

In 1862, residents fended off Indian raiders and suffered a second assault by bushwhackers. In May and June 1864, the Salina Stockade was built to protect the town against further Indian raids. The building inside the stockade was remodeled and in September 1864 was opened as Salina&#x27;s first public school. The school term ran until March 1865. The use of the building probably continued until at least June 1865.
Growth resumed with returning war veterans, and the town expanded rapidly with the arrival of the Kansas Pacific Railway in 1867. The construction of the railroad through Salina to Denver was a violation of treaty promises of Indian hunting grounds west of Salina, and Dog Soldiers began raiding the construction parties between Salina and Fort Wallace. The following U.S. military action removed Indians from western Kansas by 1868.

Salina incorporated as a city in 1870.

===Growth: 1872–1950s===
The cattle trade arrived in 1872, transforming Salina into a cowtown. It brought further prosperity, but also a rowdy culture that agitated local residents. The cattle trade relocated westward just two years later. During the 1870s, wheat became the dominant crop in the area, steam-powered flour mills were built, and agriculture became the engine of the local economy. In 1874, Salina resident E. R. Switzer introduced alfalfa to area farmers, and its cultivation spread throughout the state. By 1880, the city had become an area industrial center with several mills, a carriage and wagon factory, and a farm implement works. In 1889, the original garment factory of jeans maker Lee was opened. In the following decade, three railroads were built through the city. The success of the wholesale and milling industries drove Salina&#x27;s growth into the early 1900s, such that it was at one point the third-largest producer in the state and the sixth-largest in the United States.

In 1943, the U.S. Army established Smoky Hill Army Airfield southwest of the city. The installation served as a base for strategic bomber units throughout World War II. Renamed Smoky Hill Air Force Base in 1948, it was closed the following year and was reopened in 1951 as Schilling Air Force Base, part of the Strategic Air Command. The re-opening triggered an economic boom in Salina, causing the city&#x27;s population to increase by nearly two-thirds during the 1950s. The U.S. Department of Defense closed the base permanently in 1965, but the city of Salina acquired it and converted it into Salina Municipal Airport and an industrial park. This led to substantial industrial development, attracted firms such as Beechcraft, and made manufacturing a primary driver of the local economy.

The Salina micropolitan area is a center of trade, transportation, and industry in North Central Kansas.

==Geography==

<text>Scott City is a city and county seat of Scott County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 4,113.

==History==

===Early history===

For millennia, the Great Plains of North America were inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th to 18th centuries, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, by the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized under the provisions of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1873, Scott County was established, which included the land for modern day Scott City.

Scott City was founded in 1885. Like Scott County, the city is named in recognition of a United States General, Winfield Scott. In October 1884, two women from Chicago, Illinois claimed the land that Scott City is on and built a cabin. The following February, two men from Chicago came to the cabin and settled. Soon after, many people started arriving in the county and Scott City was then founded in 1885. Before being founded, Mrs. M.E. De Geer, one of the women that came from Chicago, started a newspaper called the &quot;Western Times&quot; in March 1885. The county then started to fill rapidly.

Scott County was legally instituted in 1873 by an act of legislature. At this time it was named in honor of General Winfield Scott. Since it was such a small town with a small population, there was no need for a local government. Therefore, it was connected to Ford County for judicial matters.

In 1903, the city incorporated with the name El Paso, but the city remained largely a rural community until after World War II.

The aviation industry had begun its growth in Wichita during the 1920s, and when the demands of the war required more airplanes, businesses such as Boeing, Cessna and Beechcraft flourished. Boeing was located a few miles north of the city, which provided a close place for workers to live. Throughout the Cold War, Boeing maintained military contracts and kept jobs nearby. In 1952, the Air Force took over Wichita Municipal Airport and founded McConnell Air Force Base between Wichita and Derby. Many airmen found homes in Derby when space on base became occupied. From 1950 to 1956, the city population grew from 432 to approximately 5000 people.

In 1956, the city name was officially changed to Derby.

<text>Eastborough is a city in Sedgwick County, Kansas, United States, and an enclave of the city of Wichita. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 756.

==History==
Eastborough was originally envisioned by Burdon Hunter, a British architect. The first development in the Eastborough area began in 1929, but the discovery of oil in the area postponed its establishment until the middle of the 1930s. Sale of Eastborough Village started April 10, 1929. It was planned to incorporate when the first thirty homes were completed, but Eastborough found itself in disputes with the neighboring Woodlawn subdivision, i. e. they could not agree upon a name for the street between them. The disputes were resolved after the two agreed to apply together for incorporation, and Eastborough and Woodlawn were incorporated as the city of Eastborough on June 1, 1937.

Eastborough became known as a &quot;speed trap&quot;, because it has a lower speed limit than Wichita, which surrounds it. The speed limit of Douglas Avenue on both sides in Wichita is 30 miles per hour, where as 20 miles per hour in Eastborough, a reduction of 33%. Eastborough has many residents who regularly walk in the streets of the city. There are no sidewalks in Eastborough which is why the city has a lower speed limit. This issue became well known after Towne East Square shopping center was built east of Eastborough in 1975, because Wichita residents would commonly travel through Eastborough to get to Towne East since nearby Kellogg had traffic congestion problems. After Wichita completed an overhaul of nearby east Kellogg in 2009, Douglas Avenue was no longer the best route to Towne East.

The city gave up some land to the expansion of Kellogg/U.S. Route 54 on its southern boundary in 2002 and a wall was constructed along the southern boundary. As part of this construction, a new pond and playground was constructed and opened in 2003.

==Geography==
Eastborough is located at (37.6864752, -97.2588378). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

Its southern boundary is Kellogg/U.S. Route 54, and northern boundary is 2nd Street.

In 1883, Ezekiel Wilder purchased farmland on the planned railway of the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway south of Blendon, Kansas, approximately west of Wichita. There, he established the town of Goddard in honor of J. F. Goddard, former third vice-president of the ATSF Railway. The railroad reached Goddard in 1884, and a post office was established there the same year. Several buildings were relocated from Blendon, including the town hall and the planned Methodist church. Goddard was officially incorporated in 1910.

On June 23, 1969, an F4 tornado struck Goddard. No fatalities occurred, but six people were injured.

===Libraries===
The Goddard Public Library, located downtown, has a collection of over 19000 volumes and offers technology services and literacy programs to the public. The library was created in March 1969 by the Goddard Woman&#x27;s Club. In 1985 a new library building was constructed after a bond issue passed. The land for this building was donated to the city by the Goddard School District. This building is currently owned by the school district and serves as its conference center. 
The library is located at 201 N. Main Street. In 2019 the library board hired its first director holding an MLS, who then hired the library&#x27;s first Programming &amp; Outreach Specialist. This began a time of incredible outreach services and growth of the library. In 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic hit. This caused a six-week mandatory shutdown, and the library began offering virtual programming. Because of the tireless efforts of staff throughout the pandemic, the library increased its patronage. This led to the library exceeding its 2019 circulation statistics by the end of 2021, a feat that not many public libraries achieved. 
In August 2021, after receiving an ARPA grant from the State Library of Kansas and IMLS, the library purchased a 2006 RV which was gutted and repurposed into a mobile library. The Goddard Public Mobile Library went into service in October 2022, increasing access to library services, programs, and information within the 65 square miles of the school district and other parts of West Wichita.

==History==

W.W. Hays came to this area in the early 1870s. In 1891, he platted land that he owned so a town could be built.
The Haysville State Bank was established in 1919. Truck farming supported a lot of the families in the area. In 1874 a grist mill was built on the bank of the Cowskin to process corn that was harvested in the area. Haysville&#x27;s first school was built in 1876 at a location that may have been near what are now the Water Department facilities. Haysville appears in Colton&#x27;s New Sectional Map of the State of Kansas as early as 1879.

In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway Company built a branch line north–south from Herington through Haysville to Caldwell.

Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Rock Island&quot;. In 1903 a depot was opened and passenger trains shuttled people to and from Wichita.

On May 3, 1999, a tornado rated F4 on the Fujita scale struck Haysville, killing 4 people in Haysville. Damage to structures included 150 homes and 27 businesses.

<text>Maize is a city in Sedgwick County, Kansas, United States, and a suburb of Wichita. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 5,735. The name Maize, derived from a Native American word for &quot;corn&quot;, was so named because it is located within the Corn Belt.

==History==
The Maize Town Company, led by N. F. Neiderlander, founded Maize in 1886 at the first stop outside of Wichita on the Wichita and Colorado Railway. The post office opened that same year as did the town&#x27;s first church, having relocated from nearby. Maize&#x27;s first school opened in 1887; its first newspaper opened in 1895. Maize State Bank, the town&#x27;s first financial institution, opened in 1901, and, by 1908, a business community had emerged. In 1915, the Maize Town Company dissolved, and Maize was incorporated as a city.

Several natural disasters struck Maize in the 1930s and 1940s, including the Dust Bowl in 1934–35, a plague of grasshoppers in 1936, and a flood in 1944.

Maize began to grow rapidly in 1950, more than doubling in size by 1956. This growth has continued, accelerating in recent years as Wichita has expanded to the northwest, and transformed Maize into a suburb.

After the approval of the Sedgwick County Board of Commissioners, Park City became a third class city on November 26, 1980. The new city held a special election on February 17, 1981, in which Raymond J. Reiss was elected mayor along with five council members to form the first governing body.

The first and only newspaper Park City has had was &quot;The Park City Newsdropper&quot;. It ran for a year in 1980 and its publisher was Jerrie Molina, the city&#x27;s first City Clerk.

Hartman Arena, a privately constructed and owned arena from local developer Wink Hartman, opened in March 2009 and serves as the home of the Wichita Wings indoor soccer and Wichita Regulators Arena Football League team.

<text>Wichita ( ) is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Kansas and the county seat of Sedgwick County. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 397,532, and the Wichita metro area had a population of 647,610. It is located in south-central Kansas along the Arkansas River.

Wichita began as a trading post on the Chisholm Trail in the 1860s and was incorporated as a city in 1870. It became a destination for cattle drives traveling north from Texas to Kansas railroads, earning it the nickname &quot;Cowtown&quot;. In 1875, Wyatt Earp served as a police officer in Wichita for about one year before going to Dodge City.

In the 1920s and 1930s, businessmen and aeronautical engineers established aircraft manufacturing companies in Wichita, including Beechcraft, Cessna, and Stearman Aircraft. The city became an aircraft production hub known as &quot;The Air Capital of the World&quot;. Textron Aviation, Learjet, Airbus, and Boeing/Spirit AeroSystems continue to operate design and manufacturing facilities in Wichita, and the city remains a major center of the American aircraft industry. Several airports located within the city of Wichita include McConnell Air Force Base, Colonel James Jabara Airport, and Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport, the largest airport in Kansas.

As an industrial hub, Wichita is a regional center of culture, media, and trade. It hosts several universities, large museums, theaters, parks, shopping centers, and entertainment venues, most notably Intrust Bank Arena and Century II. The city&#x27;s Old Cowtown Museum maintains historical artifacts and exhibits the city&#x27;s early history. Wichita State University (WSU) is the third-largest post-secondary institution in the state.

==History==
===Early history===

Archaeological evidence indicates human habitation near the confluence of the Arkansas and Little Arkansas Rivers, the site of present-day Wichita, as early as 3000 BC. In 1541, a Spanish expedition led by explorer Francisco Vázquez de Coronado found the area populated by the Quivira, or Wichita, people. Conflict with the Osage in the 1750s drove the Wichita further south. Prior to European settlement of the region, the site was in the territory of the Kiowa.

===19th century===
Claimed first by France as part of Louisiana and later acquired by the United States with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, it became part of Kansas Territory in 1854 and then the state of Kansas in 1861.

The Wichita people returned in 1863, driven from their land in Indian Territory by Confederate forces in the American Civil War, and established a settlement on the banks of the Little Arkansas. During this period, trader Jesse Chisholm established a trading post at the site, one of several along a trail extending south to Texas which became known as the Chisholm Trail. In 1867, after the war, the Wichita returned to Indian Territory.

In 1868, trader James R. Mead was among a group of investors who established a town company, and surveyor Darius Munger built a log structure for the company to serve as a hotel, community center, and post office. Business opportunities attracted area hunters and traders, and a new settlement began to form. That summer, Mead and others organized the Wichita Town Company, naming the settlement after the Wichita tribe. In 1870, Munger and German immigrant William &quot;Dutch Bill&quot; Greiffenstein filed plats laying out the city&#x27;s first streets. Wichita formally incorporated as a city on July 21, 1870.

Wichita&#x27;s position on the Chisholm Trail made it a destination for cattle drives traveling north from Texas to access railroads, which led to markets in eastern U.S. cities. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway reached the city in 1872. As a result, Wichita became a railhead for the cattle drives, earning it the nickname &quot;Cowtown&quot;. Across the Arkansas River, the town of Delano became an entertainment destination for cattlemen thanks to its saloons, brothels, and lack of law enforcement.

James Earp ran a brothel with his wife Nellie &quot;Bessie&quot; Ketchum. His brother Wyatt was likely a pimp, although historian Gary L. Roberts believes that he was an enforcer or bouncer. Local arrest records show that Earp&#x27;s common-law wife Sally and James&#x27; wife Nellie managed a brothel there from early 1874 to the middle of 1876. The area had a reputation for violence until lawmen like Wyatt stepped up enforcement, who officially joined the Wichita marshal&#x27;s office on April 21, 1875. He was hired after the election of Mike Meagher as city marshal, making $100 per month. By the middle of the decade, the cattle trade had moved west to Dodge City. Wichita annexed Delano in 1880.

Rapid immigration resulted in a speculative land boom in the late 1880s, stimulating further expansion of the city. Fairmount College, which eventually grew into Wichita State University, opened in 1886; Garfield University, which eventually became Friends University, opened in 1887. By 1890, Wichita had become the third-largest city in the state after Kansas City, and Topeka, with a population of nearly 24,000. After the boom, however, the city entered an economic recession, and many of the original settlers went bankrupt.

===20th century===
In 1914 and 1915, deposits of oil and natural gas were discovered in nearby Butler County. This triggered another economic boom in Wichita as producers established refineries, fueling stations, and headquarters in the city. By 1917, five operating refineries were in Wichita, with another seven built in the 1920s. The careers and fortunes of future oil moguls Archibald Derby, who later founded Derby Oil, and Fred C. Koch, who established what would become Koch Industries, both began in Wichita during this period.

The money generated by the oil boom enabled local entrepreneurs to invest in the nascent airplane-manufacturing industry. In 1917, Clyde Cessna built his Cessna Comet in Wichita, the first aircraft built in the city. In 1920, two local oilmen invited Chicago aircraft builder Emil &quot;Matty&quot; Laird to manufacture his designs in Wichita, leading to the formation of the Swallow Airplane Company. Two early Swallow employees, Lloyd Stearman and Walter Beech, went on to found two prominent Wichita-based companies, Stearman Aircraft in 1926 and Beechcraft in 1932, respectively. Cessna, meanwhile, started his own company in Wichita in 1927. The city became such a center of the industry that the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce dubbed it the &quot;Air Capital of the World&quot; in 1929.

Over the following decades, aviation and aircraft manufacturing continued to drive expansion of the city. In 1934, Stearman&#x27;s Wichita facilities became part of Boeing, which would become the city&#x27;s largest employer. Initial construction of Wichita Municipal Airport finished southeast of the city in 1935. During World War II, the site hosted Wichita Army Airfield and Boeing Airplane Company Plant No. 1. The city experienced a population explosion during the war when it became a major manufacturing center for the Boeing B-29 bomber. The wartime city quickly grew from 110,000 to 184,000 residents, drawing aircraft workers from throughout the central U.S. In 1951, the U.S. Air Force announced plans to assume control of the airport to establish McConnell Air Force Base. By 1954, all nonmilitary air traffic had shifted to the new Wichita Mid-Continent Airport west of the city. In 1962, Lear Jet Corporation opened with its plant adjacent to the new airport.

Throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, several other prominent businesses and brands had their origins in Wichita. A. A. Hyde founded health-care products maker Mentholatum in Wichita in 1889. Sporting goods and camping-gear retailer Coleman started in the city in the early 1900s. A number of fast-food franchises started in Wichita, beginning with White Castle in 1921 and followed by many more in the 1950s and 1960s including Pizza Hut in 1958. In the 1970s and 1980s, the city became a regional center of health care and medical research.

Wichita has been a focal point of national political controversy multiple times in its history. In 1900, famous temperance extremist Carrie Nation struck in Wichita upon learning the city was not enforcing Kansas&#x27;s prohibition ordinance. The Dockum Drug Store sit-in took place in the city in 1958 with protesters pushing for desegregation. In 1991, thousands of anti-abortion protesters blockaded and held sit-ins at Wichita abortion clinics, particularly the clinic of George Tiller. Tiller was later murdered in Wichita by Scott Roeder in 2009.

===21st century===
Except for a slow period in the 1970s, Wichita has continued to grow steadily into the 21st century. In the late 1990s and 2000s, the city government and local organizations began collaborating to redevelop downtown Wichita and older neighborhoods in the city. Intrust Bank Arena opened downtown in 2010.

Boeing ended its operations in Wichita in 2014. However, the city remains a national center of aircraft manufacturing with other companies including Spirit AeroSystems and Airbus maintaining facilities in Wichita.

Wichita Mid-Continent Airport was officially renamed Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport after the Kansas native and U.S. President in 2015.

==Geography==
Wichita is in south-central Kansas at the junction of Interstate 35 and U.S. Route 54. Part of the Midwestern United States, it is north of Oklahoma City, southwest of Kansas City, and east-southeast of Denver.

The city lies on the Arkansas River near the western edge of the Flint Hills in the Wellington-McPherson Lowlands region of the Great Plains. The area&#x27;s topography is characterized by the broad alluvial plain of the Arkansas River valley and the moderately rolling slopes that rise to the higher lands on either side.

The Arkansas follows a winding course, south-southeast through Wichita, roughly bisecting the city. It is joined along its course by several tributaries, all of which flow generally south. The largest is the Little Arkansas River, which enters the city from the north and joins the Arkansas immediately west of downtown. Further east lies Chisholm Creek, which joins the Arkansas in the far southern part of the city. The Chisholm&#x27;s own tributaries drain much of the city&#x27;s eastern half; these include the creek&#x27;s West, Middle, and East Forks, as well as further south, Gypsum Creek. The Gypsum is fed by its own tributary, Dry Creek. Two more of the Arkansas&#x27;s tributaries lie west of its course; from east to west, these are Big Slough Creek and Cowskin Creek. Both run south through the western part of the city. Fourmile Creek, a tributary of the Walnut River, flows south through the far eastern part of the city.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are covered by water.

As the core of the Wichita metropolitan area, the city is surrounded by suburbs. Bordering Wichita on the north are, from west to east, Valley Center, Park City, Kechi, and Bel Aire. Enclosed within east-central Wichita is Eastborough. Adjacent to the city&#x27;s east side is Andover. McConnell Air Force Base is in the extreme southeast corner of the city. To the south, from east to west, lie Derby and Haysville. Goddard and Maize border Wichita to the west and northwest, respectively.

===Climate===
====Climatic influences on weather====
Wichita lies within the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), typically experiencing hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters. Located on the Great Plains, far from any large moderating influences such as mountains or large bodies of water, Wichita often experiences severe weather with thunderstorms occurring frequently during the spring and summer. These occasionally bring large hail and frequent lightning. Particularly destructive ones have struck the Wichita area several times in the course of its history - in September 1965, during the Andover, Kansas tornado outbreak of April 1991, and during the Oklahoma tornado outbreak of May 1999. Winters are cold and dry; since Wichita is roughly midway between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, cold spells and warm spells are equally frequent. Warm air masses from the Gulf of Mexico can raise midwinter temperatures into the 50s and even 60s (°F), while cold-air masses from the Arctic can occasionally plunge the temperature below 0 °F. Wind speed in the city averages . On average, January is the coldest month (and the driest), July the hottest, and May the wettest.

====Weather data====
The average temperature in the city is . Over the course of a year, the monthly daily average temperature ranges from in January to in July. The high temperature reaches or exceeds an average of 65 days a year and an average of 12 days a year. The minimum temperature falls to or below on an average 7.7 days a year. The hottest temperature recorded in Wichita was in 1936; the coldest temperature recorded was on February 12, 1899. Readings as low as and as high as occurred as recently as February 16, 2021, and July 29–30, 2012, respectively. Wichita receives on average about of precipitation a year, most of which falls in the warmer months, and experiences 87 days of measurable precipitation. The average relative humidity is 80% in the morning and 49% in the evening. Annual snowfall averages . Measurable snowfall occurs an average of nine days per year with at least an inch of snow falling on four of those days. Snow depth of at least an inch occurs an average of 12 days per year. The average window for freezing temperatures is October 25 through April 9.

====Pollen and other allergens====
Wichita is consistently ranked as one of the worst major cities in the nation for seasonal allergies, due largely to tree and grass pollen (partly from surrounding open plains and pastureland), and smoke from frequent burning of fields by the region&#x27;s farmers and ranchers, driven by the strong Kansas winds. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, ranked Wichita—out of the nation&#x27;s 100 largest cities—6th worst for people with allergies in 2016, 3rd worst in 2021, 2nd worst in 2022, and worst nationwide in 2023.

===Neighborhoods===

Wichita has several recognized areas and neighborhoods. The downtown area is generally considered to be east of the Arkansas River, west of Washington Street, north of Kellogg, and south of 13th Street. It contains landmarks such as Century II, the Garvey Center, and the Epic Center. Old Town is also part of downtown; this area is home to a cluster of nightclubs, bars, restaurants, a movie theater, shops, and apartments and condominiums, many of which make use of historical warehouse-type spaces.

Two notable residential areas of Wichita are Riverside and College Hill. Riverside is northwest of downtown, across the Arkansas River, and surrounds the Riverside Park. College Hill is east of downtown and south of Wichita State University. It is one of the more historic neighborhoods, along with Delano on the west side and Midtown in the north-central city.

Four other historic neighborhoods—developed in southeast Wichita (particularly near Boeing, Cessna and Beech aircraft plants) -- are among the nation&#x27;s few remaining examples of U.S. government-funded temporary World War II housing developments to support war factory personnel: Beechwood (now mostly demolished), Oaklawn, Hilltop (the city&#x27;s highest-density large neighborhood), and massive Planeview (where over 30 languages are spoken) -- in all, home to about a fifth of the city&#x27;s population at their peak. Though designed as temporary housing, all have remained occupied into the 21st century, most becoming low-income neighborhoods.

==Demographics==

In terms of population, Wichita is the largest city in Kansas and the 49th largest city in the United States, according to the 2020 census.

Wichita has an extensive history of attracting immigrants. Starting in 1895, a population of Lebanese Americans moved to the city, many of whom were Orthodox Christians. A second wave of Lebanese migrants moved to Wichita to flee the Civil War in their homeland. Thousands of immigrants from Vietnam moved to Wichita in the aftermath of the Vietnam War.

===2020 census===
The 2020 United States census counted 397,532 people, 154,683 households, and 92,969 families in Wichita. The population density was 2,454.1 per square mile (947.5/km). There were 172,801 housing units at an average density of 1,066.7 per square mile (411.9/km).

The U.S. census accounts for race by two methodologies. &quot;Race alone&quot; and &quot;Race alone less Hispanics&quot; where Hispanics are delineated separately as if a separate race.

Approximately, 10.9% of families and 15.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 21.4% of those under the age of 18 and 8.7% of those ages 65 or over.

===2010 census===
As of the census of 2010, 382,368 people, 151,818 households, and 94,862 families were residing in the city. The population density was . The 167,310 housing units had an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 71.9% White, 11.5% African American, 4.8% Asian, 1.2% American Indian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 6.2% from other races, and 4.3% from two or more races. Hispanics and Latinos of any race were 15.3% of the population.

===Metropolitan area===

Wichita is the principal city of both the Wichita Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and the Wichita-Winfield Combined Statistical Area (CSA). The Wichita MSA encompasses Sedgwick, Butler, Harvey, and Sumner counties and, as of 2010, had a population of 623,061, making it the 84th largest MSA in the United States.

The larger Wichita-Winfield CSA also includes Cowley County and, as of 2013, had an estimated population of 673,598. Nearby Reno County is not a part of the Wichita MSA or Wichita-Winfield CSA, but, were it included, it would add an additional population of 64,511 as of 2010.

==Economy==
Restaurants founded in Wichita include White Castle and Pizza Hut. A survey of well-known Kansas-based brands conducted by RSM Marketing Services and the Wichita Consumer Research Center showed many of the top-25 Kansas-based brands such as Koch, Coleman, Cessna, Pizza Hut, Beechcraft, Freddy&#x27;s, and more are based in Wichita.

Wichita&#x27;s principal industrial sector is manufacturing, which accounted for 21.6% of area employment in 2003. Aircraft manufacturing has long dominated the local economy, and plays such an important role that it has the ability to influence the economic health of the entire region; the state offers tax breaks and other incentives to aircraft manufacturers.

Healthcare is Wichita&#x27;s second-largest industry, employing about 28,000 people in the local area. Since healthcare needs remain fairly consistent regardless of the economy, this field was not subject to the same pressures that affected other industries in the early 2000s. The Kansas Spine Hospital opened in 2004, as did a critical-care tower at Wesley Medical Center. In July 2010, Via Christi Health, which is the largest provider of healthcare services in Kansas, opened a hospital that will serve the northwest area of Wichita. Via Christi Hospital on St. Teresa is the system&#x27;s fifth hospital to serve the Wichita community. In 2016, Wesley Healthcare opened Wesley Children&#x27;s Hospital, the first and only children&#x27;s hospital in the Wichita area.

Thanks to the early 20th-century oil boom in neighboring Butler County, Kansas, Wichita became a major oil town, with dozens of oil-exploration companies and support enterprises. Most famous of these was Koch Industries, today a global natural-resources conglomerate. The city was also at one time the headquarters of the former Derby Oil Company, which was purchased by Coastal Corporation in 1988.

Koch Industries and Cargill, the two largest privately held companies in the United States, both operate headquarters facilities in Wichita. Koch Industries&#x27; primary global corporate headquarters is in a large office-tower complex in northeast Wichita. Cargill Meat Solutions Div., at one time the nation&#x27;s third-largest beef producer, is headquartered downtown. Other firms with headquarters in Wichita include roller-coaster manufacturer Chance Morgan, gourmet food retailer Dean &amp; Deluca, renewable energy company Alternative Energy Solutions, and Coleman Company, a manufacturer of camping and outdoor recreation supplies. Air Midwest, the nation&#x27;s first officially certificated &quot;commuter&quot; airline, was founded and headquartered in Wichita and evolved into the nation&#x27;s eighth-largest regional airline prior to its dissolution in 2008.

As of 2013, 68.2% of the population over the age of 16 was in the labor force; 0.6% was in the armed forces, and 67.6% was in the civilian labor force with 61.2% employed and 6.4% unemployed. The occupational composition of the employed civilian labor force was 33.3% in management, business, science, and arts; 25.1% in sales and office occupations; 17.2% in service occupations; 14.0% in production, transportation, and material moving; and 10.4% in natural resources, construction, and maintenance. The three industries employing the largest percentages of the working civilian labor force were educational services, health care, and social assistance (22.3%); manufacturing (19.2%); and retail trade (11.0%).

The cost of living in Wichita is below average; compared to a U.S. average of 100, the cost of living index for the city is 84.0. As of 2013, the median home value in the city was $117,500, the median selected monthly owner cost was $1,194 for housing units with a mortgage and $419 for those without, and the median gross rent was $690.

===Aircraft manufacturing===
From the early to late 20th century, aircraft pioneers such as Clyde Cessna, Emil Matthew &quot;Matty&quot; Laird, Lloyd Stearman, Walter Beech, Al Mooney and Bill Lear began aircraft-manufacturing enterprises that led to Wichita becoming the nation&#x27;s leading city in numbers of aircraft produced, earning Wichita, in 1928, the 1929 title &quot;Air Capital City&quot; from the nation&#x27;s Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce — a title the city would claim permanently.

The aircraft corporations E. M. Laird Aviation Company (the nation&#x27;s first successful commercial airplane manufacturer), Travel Air (started by Beech, Stearman, and Cessna), Stearman, Cessna, Beechcraft, and Mooney were all founded in Wichita between 1920 and early 1932. By 1931, Boeing (of Seattle, Washington) had absorbed Stearman, creating &quot;Boeing-Wichita&quot;, which would eventually grow to become Kansas&#x27; largest employer. During World War II, employment peak at Boeing-Wichita was 29,795 in December 1943.

Today, Cessna Aircraft Co. (the world&#x27;s highest-volume airplane manufacturer) and Beechcraft remain based in Wichita, having merged into Textron Aviation in 2014, along with Learjet and Boeing&#x27;s chief sub-assembly supplier, Spirit AeroSystems. Airbus maintains a workforce in Wichita, and Bombardier (parent company of Learjet) has other divisions in Wichita, as well. Over 50 other aviation businesses operate in the Wichita MSA, as well as over 350 suppliers and subcontractors to the local aircraft manufacturers. In total, Wichita and its companies have manufactured an estimated 250,000 aircraft since Clyde Cessna&#x27;s first Wichita-built aircraft in 1916.

In the early 2000s, a national and international recession combined with the after-effects of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to depress the aviation subsector in and around Wichita. Orders for new aircraft plummeted, prompting Wichita&#x27;s five largest aircraft manufacturers, Boeing Co., Cessna Aircraft Co., Bombardier Learjet Inc., Hawker Beechcraft, and Raytheon Aircraft Co.—to slash a combined 15,000 jobs between 2001 and 2004. In response, these companies began developing small- and mid-sized airplanes to appeal to business and corporate users.

In 2007, Wichita built 977 aircraft, ranging from single-engine light aircraft to the world&#x27;s fastest civilian jet; one-fifth of the civilian aircraft produced in United States that year, plus numerous small military aircraft. In early 2012, Boeing announced it would be closing its Wichita plant by the end of 2013, which paved the road for Spirit Aerosystems to open its plant (actually, the Boeing-Wichita factory, still producing the same aircraft assemblies for Boeing, but officially under a different corporation).

==Arts and culture==
===Arts===
Wichita is home to several art museums and performing arts groups. The Wichita Art Museum is the largest art museum in the state of Kansas and contains 7,000 works in permanent collections. The Ulrich Museum of Art at Wichita State University is a modern and contemporary art museum with over 6,300 works in its permanent collection.

===Music===
Wichita is the music hub of central Kansas, and draws major acts from around the world, performing at various concert halls, arenas, and stadiums around the area. Most major rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll and pop-music stars, and virtually all country music stars, perform there during their career.

Music Theatre Wichita, Wichita Grand Opera (both nationally renowned), and the Wichita Symphony Orchestra perform regularly at the Century II Convention Hall downtown. Concerts are also regularly performed by the nationally noted schools of music at Wichita&#x27;s two largest universities.

The Orpheum Theatre, a classic movie palace built in 1922, serves as a downtown venue for smaller shows. The Cotillion, a special events facility built in 1960, serves a similar purpose as a music venue.

===Events===
The Wichita River Festival has been held in the Downtown and Old Town areas of the city since 1972. It has featured events, musical entertainment, sporting events, traveling exhibits, cultural and historical activities, plays, interactive children&#x27;s events, a flea market, river events, a parade, block parties, a food court, fireworks, and souvenirs for the roughly 370,000+ patrons who attend each year. In 2011, the festival was moved from May to June because of rain during previous festivals. The Wichita River Festival has seen immense growth, with record numbers in 2016 and again in 2018. Much of that growth is attributed to attractive musical acts at the festival.

Wichita customarily holds major parades for the River Festival, Christmas season (shortly after Thanksgiving), Veterans Day, Juneteenth, and St. Patrick&#x27;s Day.

The annual Wichita Black Arts Festival, held in the spring, celebrates the arts, crafts, and creativity of Wichita&#x27;s large African-American community. It usually takes place in Central-Northeast Wichita. A Juneteenth event and parade also are common annual events.

The annual Wichita Asian Festival, usually held at Century II in October, displays the native arts, crafts, cultural performances and foods of Wichita&#x27;s large, diverse Asian community from the Middle East, Central and South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia. The event includes many varied performances of Asian music, dance, acrobatics and martial arts, talent pageant, and vendors of Asian arts and crafts. Dozens of food vendors serve the cuisine of most Asian nations.

The International Student Association at Wichita State University presents an annual international cultural exhibition and food festival, on the campus at WSU, providing an inexpensive sampling of global culture and cuisine to the general public.

One or more large Renaissance fairs occur annually, including the &quot;RenFair&quot; in conjunction with the &quot;Kingdom of Calontir&quot; of the SCA (Society for Creative Anachronism). The fairs vary in length from one day to a week, typically at Sedgwick County Park or Newman University.

The Wichita Public Library&#x27;s Academy Awards Shorts program is reportedly the oldest annual, complete, free public screening outside of Hollywood of the full array of short films nominated for an Academy Award (&quot;Oscar&quot;). In late winter, shortly before the Academy Awards ceremonies, the films—including all nominated documentary, live action, and animated shorts—are presented, free, at the Library and in local theaters and other venues around Wichita. Wichita&#x27;s former Congressman, Motion Picture Association President Dan Glickman, has served as honorary chair of the event, and some of the filmmakers have attended and visited with the audiences.

Wichita is also home to two major indoor shopping malls: Towne East Square, managed by Simon Property Group, and Towne West Square. Towne East is home to four anchor stores and has more than 100 tenants. Towne West Square, which was put into foreclosure in 2019, was still operational as of 2021. The oldest mall, Wichita Mall, was for many years largely a dead mall, but has since been converted into office space. There are also two large outdoor shopping centers, Bradley Fair (which hosts jazz concerts and art festivals) located on the city&#x27;s northeast side and New Market Square located on the city&#x27;s northwest side. Each establishment consists of over 50 stores spread out on several acres.

In 1936, the Wichita post office contained two oil-on-canvas murals, &quot;Kansas Farming&quot;, painted by Richard Haines and &quot;Pioneer in Kansas&quot; by Ward Lockwood. Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department. The post office building became the Federal Courthouse at 401 N. Market Street and the murals are on display in the lobby.

Under state statute, Wichita is a city of the first class. Since 1917, it has had a council–manager form of government. The city council consists of seven members popularly elected every four years with staggered terms in office. For representative purposes, the city is divided into six districts with one council member elected from each. The mayor is the seventh council member, elected at large. The council sets policy for the city, enacts laws and ordinances, levies taxes, approves the city budget, and appoints members to citizen commission and advisory boards. It meets each Tuesday. The city manager is the city&#x27;s chief executive, responsible for administering city operations and personnel, submitting the annual city budget, advising the city council, preparing the council&#x27;s agenda, and oversight of non-departmental activities. As of 2024, the city council consists of Mayor Lily Wu, Brandon Johnson (District 1), Becky Tuttle (District 2), Mike Hoheisel (District 3), Dalton Glasscock (District 4), J.V.

==Infrastructure==
===Flood control===
Wichita suffered severe floods of the Arkansas river in 1877, 1904, 1916, 1923, 1944, 1951 and 1955. In 1944 the city flooded 3 times in 11 days.
As a result of the 1944 flood, the idea for the Wichita-Valley Center Floodway (locally known as the &quot;Big Ditch&quot;) was conceived. The project was completed in 1958. The Big Ditch diverts part of the Arkansas River&#x27;s flow around west-central Wichita, running roughly parallel to the Interstate 235 bypass. A second flood control canal lies between the lanes of Interstate 135, running south through the central part of the city. Chisholm Creek is diverted into this canal for most of its length. The city&#x27;s flood defenses were tested in the Great Flood of 1993. Flooding that year kept the Big Ditch full for more than a month and caused $6 million of damage to the flood control infrastructure. The damage was not fully repaired until 2007. In 2019, the Floodway was renamed the MS Mitch Mitchell Floodway in honor of the man credited for its creation.

Early settler Seymour S. Rogers built the first house in what would become Liberal in 1872. Rogers became famous in the region for giving free water to thirsty travelers.

Rogers named the post office &#x27;Liberal&#x27;. After the railroad was built close by, a plan for the town site was created in 1888. A year later the population was around 800.

Drought caused some farmers to give up and look for more fertile territory; however, when the nearby Indian Territory was opened, more settlers headed to the cheap land that would become Oklahoma.

Natural gas was discovered west of town, in what would become part of the massive Panhandle-Hugoton Gas Field, in 1920. Oil was discovered southwest of town in 1951. In 1963 the largest helium plant in the world, National Helium, was opened.

<text>Auburn is a city in Shawnee County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 1,273.

==History==

===19th century===
In July 1854, John W. Brown came to this area and found it highly suitable for a homestead. He acquired through bartering with local Indians and later returned home to Missouri to tell his family and friends about the area, some of whom returned with him. In 1856, Mr. Brown, along with M. C. Dickey, Loring Farnsworth and Henry Fox pre-empted for the purpose of a town. They christened it Brownville, although it was changed in 1857 to its present name of &quot;Auburn&quot; due to the fact there was another settlement with the same name. This was before the introduction of postal codes. It was located on the California Road and work began at once on the many buildings needed in a town of Brownville&#x27;s size. Two daily stage lines brought mail and people to the town and business was very good.

Robert Simmerwell was a missionary to the Indians in Auburn. He originally served as a missionary among the Pottawatomie Indians in Michigan Territory, while he apprenticed to a blacksmith and attended school at night. He later came to the Baptist Shawnee Mission on Pottawatomie Creek in eastern Kansas. In 1848, the government set up a new mission a few miles west of Topeka. In a three-story stone building with twelve rooms, boys and girls were given instruction in the manual arts, as well as in reading, writing, arithmetic, and religious subjects. In the fall of 1854, Simmerwell and his wife had retired from active work in the Pottawatomie Mission, to homestead on southwest of the town.

In the 1850s, the city grew rapidly and was often referred to as a &quot;boom town&quot;. It was one of the largest in the state, and nearly became the state capital. However, Auburn was cast aside as an option, as the railroad bypassed the city. Topeka was chosen to be the capital because it had the railroad and an important ferry site along the Kansas River. Auburn&#x27;s population dwindled, but continued to hover around 100 for many decades.

===20th century===
A description of the town from a 1912 volume of &quot;Kansas: A Cyclopedia of State History&quot; is as follows:

&quot;Auburn, a money order post office of Shawnee county, is in the township of the same name, about southwest of Topeka and west of Wakarusa, which is the nearest railroad station. It is a trading center for that section of the county, has Baptist, Methodist and Presbyterian churches, telephone connection with Topeka and other adjacent points, and in 1910 reported a population of 72. Two rural free delivery routes start from the Auburn office and supply daily mail to the farmers of the vicinity.&quot;

Auburn finally began to grow in population in the 1950s. An important issue at this time was the city&#x27;s small school system. It consisted of Auburn Grade School (grades K-5) and Auburn High School (grades 6-12). The Highschool was quickly becoming overcrowded. It was eventually decided that the Auburn School district would merge with the Washburn School District to increase efficiency. The last class graduated from Auburn High in 1966. The high school was razed to construct Auburn Middle School, and in 1990 this school closed and was converted to a community center, and the grade school remains open to this day.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the city&#x27;s population shrank, but was re-vitalized with large housing projects. Between 1975 and 1985, roughly 100 new split-level homes were built.

===21st century===
Most Auburn residents commute to other surrounding cities for work, often Topeka. Currently, there are three churches in Auburn: Presbyterian, Christian, and Methodist. The Auburn Community Center houses a community library.

Auburn has a full-time police department and a fully equipped volunteer fire department (Shawnee County Fire No. 2). There is also a road maintenance and utilities department.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Auburn has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

The towns agreed to consolidate and carry out that plan, making Hoxie the new county seat. It was named for H.M. Hoxie, a railroad official.

<text>Goodland is a city in and the county seat of Sherman County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 4,465. It was named after Goodland, Indiana. Goodland is home to Northwest Kansas Technical College.

==History==
One of the earliest pieces of recorded history relating to Goodland concerns the Kidder Massacre. On July 2, 1867, a detachment of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment was massacred; second lieutenant Lyman S. Kidder in command of the party, a sergeant, a corporal, eight privates and an Indian guide lost their lives. They were carrying dispatches for Lieutenant Colonel George Custer. Later, Custer found evidence of a running battle along Beaver Creek, which led to a ravine where the remains were found. They had been killed by Cheyenne and/or Sioux Indians.

In 1886, there were four communities vying to become county seat for Sherman County: Itasca, Voltaire, Sherman Center and Eustis. A man named Clark showed up in the county in 1887 proposing to create a new town to settle the dispute. The new town was to be named Goodland. A vote for the county seat was held among the county population and Goodland won with 872 of the 1495 votes cast, while Eustis received 611 and Voltaire received 12. Citizens of Eustis declared that the votes were unfair, but the state department said that nothing could be done as all the voting was complete. The Supreme Court of Kansas considered various proceedings but did not change the outcome of the vote. Eustis refused to yield the county records it held until January 13, 1888, when an armed group from Goodland seized the records and sent them to the new county seat.

Goodland sprang up around the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad that had been built through it. The town was named after Goodland, Indiana.
