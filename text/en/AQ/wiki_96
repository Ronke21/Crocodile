==History==
===Early history===

For millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. These tribes considered native included: the Arapaho, Cheyenne, Comanche, Kansa, Kiowa, Osage, Pawnee, and Wichita. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===

In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1806, Zebulon Pike led the Pike Expedition westward from St Louis, Missouri, of which part of their journey followed the Cottonwood River through Marion County near the current cities of Florence, Marion, Durham.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1855, Marion County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Florence.

The first settlers in Marion County located on Doyle Creek, near the present site of Florence. They were Moses Shane, who came in 1858, and whose death the next year was the first in the county; Patrick Doyle, in 1859, for whom Doyle Creek and Township were named, and a family by the name of Welsh, in which occurred the first birth in the county in August 1859. A post office existed in Doyle from November 26, 1866 to March 13, 1871.

The Florence Town Company was a group of men who learned of the proposed route of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, extended from Emporia, who decided on a town site where the railroad would cross the Cottonwood River. On September 23, 1870, there was announcement in &quot;The Emporia News&quot; about a new town named &quot;Florence&quot; at the mouth of Doyle Creek. The Florence Town Company was formed on December 1, 1870 with Samuel J. Crawford as the president. Previously, Crawford was the 3rd Governor of Kansas from 1865 to 1868. He named the town, Florence, in honor of his daughter, Miss Florence Crawford of Topeka. The post office moved from Doyle to Florence on March 13, 1871.
In 1871, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway extended a main line from Emporia through Florence to Newton. In 1996, it merged with Burlington Northern Railroad and renamed to the current BNSF Railway. The Santa Fe depot building still exists, but has been closed for decades. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Santa Fe&quot;.

In 1877, the Florence, El Dorado, and Walnut Valley Railroad Company built a branch line from Florence to El Dorado, in 1881 it was extended to Douglass, and later to Arkansas City. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to El Dorado was abandoned in 1942. The original branch line connected Florence, Burns, De Graff, El Dorado, Augusta, Douglass, Rock, Akron, Winfield and Arkansas City.

As early as 1875, city leaders of Marion held a meeting to consider a branch railroad from Florence. In 1878, the Marion and McPherson Railway Company was chartered. In 1879, a branch line was built from Florence to McPherson; in 1880 it was extended to Lyons and in 1881 was extended to Ellinwood. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to Marion was abandoned in 1968. In 1992, the line from Marion to McPherson was sold to Central Kansas Railway. In 1993, after heavy flood damage, the line from Marion to McPherson was abandoned. The original branch line connected Florence, Marion, Canada, Hillsboro, Lehigh, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Conway, Windom, Little River, Mitchell, Lyons, Chase and Ellinwood.

In 1877, Fred Harvey, an entrepreneur who is credited with establishing the first restaurant chain in the United States, bought the Clifton Hotel near the Florence railroad station for $5,370. Harvey redecorated the hotel and early in 1878, the second Harvey House Restaurant opened in Florence - the first Harvey House to offer sleeping rooms in addition to a restaurant.

===20th century===
There have been numerous floods during the early history of Florence. In June and July 1951, due to heavy rains, rivers and streams flooded numerous cities in Kansas, including Florence. Many reservoirs and levees were built in Kansas as part of a response to the Great Flood of 1951. From 1964 to 1968, the Marion Reservoir was constructed north-west of Marion. Downstream from the Marion Reservoir, levees were built in low-lying areas of Marion and Florence.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Two highways cross through Florence: U.S. Routes 50 and 77. The intersection of these two highways had been known for numerous accidents in the past. In July 2003, two teen-agers died when they started crossing U.S. 50 and were struck by a semi-truck. By fall 2003, the Florence intersection was converted to a four-way stop with beacons and rumble strips. This solution lowered cross-traffic accidents, but increased rear-end collisions. To make the intersection safer, the Kansas Department of Transportation converted it into a 205-feet diameter roundabout, and completed it in September 2006.

The BNSF Railway passes through Florence and runs nearly parallel to U.S. Route 50.

<text>Goessel is a city in Marion County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 556. The city was named after Captain Kurt von Goessel (1852–1895) who went down with his ship, the Elbe, in the English Channel after it was rammed. It is located about 11 miles north of North Newton on the west side of K-15 highway.
==History==
===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to the 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for present-day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000-square-mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

The Kansas Territory was organized in 1854, and Kansas became the 34th U.S. state in 1861. In 1855, Marion County was established within the Kansas Territory and included present-day Goessel.

The year 1874 saw the first wave of an immigration of Plautdietsch-speaking Russian Mennonites to south-central Kansas. The move was an attempt to preserve religious heritage and freedom after exclusion from military service was rescinded. In 1873 twelve Mennonite delegates from the Russian Empire toured Manitoba and Kansas, with the four conservative Mennonite delegates selecting the East Reserve in Manitoba and the eight liberal delegates selecting immigration to Kansas. In the next decade, one-third of Mennonites in Russia moved to North America. In 1874 a large number of Mennonites from the Molotschna Colony emigrated en masse to the United States aboard the ships Teutonia and Cimbria. This group split into two groups. The Alexanderwohl group sailed on the Cimbria and settled around present-day Goessel, and the Hoffnungsau group sailed on the Teutonia and settled around present-day Buhler and Inman.

The Alexanderwohl group split into eight communal villages. The village of Gnadenfeld (translation: Grace Field) was located where Goessel now stands. The village lasted for several years as a communal village, and then families moved onto their own larger parcels of land nearby. Several years passed before a trading center developed. The first public structure erected in Goessel was the Mennonite Brethren church in 1890, and one of the first businesses was a creamery station established that same year. In 1891 a small mercantile store was opened and Dr. Peter Richert moved into a building that was used as his doctor&#x27;s office; later it became a post office. Dr. Richert read the story of Captain Kurt von Goessel, who went down with his steamship &quot;Elbe&quot; in the English Channel, and decided to submit the name Goessel to the U.S. Postal Department; the name was accepted on April 13, 1895.

===20th century===

In 1910, Goessel was platted and had a population of 100 people. In 1952, Goessel was incorporated and had a population of 260. In 2010, the United States Census reported 248 households and a population of 539.

On March 13, 1990, Goessel was damaged by an &quot;extreme F5&quot; tornado during a tornado outbreak. The severity of the damage left behind by this tornado led some meteorologists to believe that the Goessel tornado was among the strongest ever documented at that time.

Goessel is home to the Mennonite Heritage Museum, a complex of eight buildings that preserve artifacts from early Mennonite households, farms, schools, and churches and the Bethesda Mennonite Hospital.

<text>Hillsboro is a city in Marion County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 2,732. The city was named after John Hill, who homesteaded in the area in 1871. Hillsboro is the home of Tabor College.
==History==
===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1855, Marion County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Hillsboro.

Hillsboro was named after John Gillespie Hill, who homesteaded in the area in 1871. Originally Hill City was the city name; since another city in Kansas already bore that name, it was changed to Hillsboro on June 20, 1879. A post office was established in Risley on April 10, 1873, then moved to Hillsboro on August 29, 1879.

As early as 1875, city leaders of Marion held a meeting to consider a branch railroad from Florence. In 1878, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and parties from Marion and McPherson counties chartered the Marion and McPherson Railway Company. In 1879, a branch line was built from Florence to McPherson; in 1880 it was extended to Lyons and in 1881 was extended to Ellinwood. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to Marion was abandoned in 1968. In 1992, the line from Marion to McPherson was sold to Central Kansas Railway. In 1993, after heavy flood damage, the line from Marion through Hillsboro to McPherson was abandoned and removed. The original branch line connected Florence, Marion, Canada, Hillsboro, Lehigh, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Conway, Windom, Little River, Mitchell, Lyons, Chase and Ellinwood.

===20th century===
In 1908, Tabor College was founded by members of the Mennonite Brethren and Krimmer Mennonite Brethren Christian churches.

The National Old Trails Road, also known as the Ocean-to-Ocean Highway, was established in 1912, and was routed through Lehigh, Hillsboro, Marion and Lost Springs.

==History==
===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1855, Marion County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Lehigh.

The source of the Lehigh name was not well documented. One of the rumors is the city being slightly higher altitude which was &quot;lay high&quot; above the prairie, the other rumor that it was named by representatives of Lehigh County, Pennsylvania who came to Kansas and considered settling the area in the 1870s or 1880s.

Four and one-half miles north of Lehigh is the junction of the old Santa Fe Trail and Chisolm Trail, which is near the site of the municipal water well for the city. The Santa Fe Trail was active across Marion County from 1821 to 1866, and the Chisholm Trail was active from 1867 to 1871.

As early as 1875, city leaders of Marion held a meeting to consider a branch railroad from Florence. In 1878, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and parties from Marion and McPherson counties chartered the Marion and McPherson Railway Company. In 1879, a branch line was built from Florence to McPherson, in 1880 it was extended to Lyons, in 1881 it was extended to Ellinwood. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to Marion was abandoned in 1968. In 1992, the line from Marion to McPherson was sold to Central Kansas Railway. In 1993, after heavy flood damage, the line from Marion through Lehigh to McPherson was abandoned and removed. The original branch line connected Florence, Marion, Canada, Hillsboro, Lehigh, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Conway, Windom, Little River, Mitchell, Lyons, Chase and Ellinwood. The former 1879 Lehigh rail depot was moved to Walton and sits next to Highway 50.

A post office was established at Lehigh on April 23, 1880.

Lehigh was platted in 1881.

===20th century===
Lehigh was incorporated in 1901 and at the time of the 1910 census had a population of 385. At one time it boasted a bank, several mercantile businesses, and a German weekly Mennonite newspaper, &quot;Das Echo&quot;, started in 1897.

The National Old Trails Road, also known as the Ocean-to-Ocean Highway, was established in 1912, and was routed through Lehigh, Hillsboro, Marion, Lost Springs.

==History==
===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1855, Marion County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Lincolnville.

The first settlers to the area were Heman Deal (1860) and Thomas Wise, Jr (1863). A post office was established in Lincolnville on December 31, 1868.

The first Lincolnville plat was filed by Robert C McAllister on May 18, 1872, but the patent from the United States government was not granted until August 23, 1878. President Abraham Lincoln is the city&#x27;s namesake.

In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a branch line north-south from Herington through Lincolnville to Caldwell. It foreclosed in 1891 and was taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980 and reorganized as Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad, merged in 1988 with Missouri Pacific Railroad, and finally merged in 1997 with Union Pacific Railroad. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Rock Island&quot;.

<text>Lost Springs is a city in Marion County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 55. The city was named for a nearby lost spring that was a camping spot along the 19th century Santa Fe Trail. It is located south of Herington, approximately 0.6 mile west of the intersection of U.S. Route 77 (aka U.S. Route 56) highway and 340th Street, adjacent to the Union Pacific Railroad.

==History==

===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===

In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

From the 1820s to the 1870s, one of the most significant land routes in the United States was the Santa Fe Trail. The &quot;Lost Spring&quot; was one of the favorite camping spots on the Santa Fe Trail because it generally had an ample supply of good water. It was located 15 miles west of Diamond Spring, which was a day&#x27;s travel for a wagon train. The spring apparently got its name because it is a periodic spring, drying up at times for a week, a month, or even two years, so those visiting the site sometimes could not locate the spring on a return trip. A stage station was set up nearby in 1859 and was known as the Lost Springs Station, but no visible evidence remains of the station. The trail was active across Marion County from 1821 to 1866.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1855, Marion County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Lost Springs.
A post office existed in Lost Spring from August 29, 1861, to May 23, 1864. Later, the post office was reestablished as Lost Springs on July 9, 1879.

In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a branch line north–south from Herington through Lost Springs to Caldwell. It foreclosed in 1891 and was taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980 and reorganized as Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad, merged in 1988 with Missouri Pacific Railroad, and finally merged in 1997 with Union Pacific Railroad. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Rock Island&quot;.
In 1887, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway built a branch line from Neva (three miles west of Strong City) to Superior, Nebraska. This branch line connects Strong City, Neva, Rockland, Diamond Springs, Burdick, Lost Springs, Jacobs, Hope, Navarre, Enterprise, Abilene, Talmage, Manchester, Longford, Oak Hill, Miltonvale, Aurora, Huscher, Concordia, Kackley, Courtland, Webber and Superior. In 1996, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway merged with Burlington Northern Railroad and renamed to the current BNSF Railway. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Santa Fe&quot;.

At some point, the &quot;Santa Fe&quot; line from Neva to Lost Springs was pulled, but the right of way has not been abandoned. This branch line was originally called &quot;Strong City and Superior line&quot; but later the name was shortened to the &quot;Strong City line&quot;. The two railways are connected via a switch to allow north-bound &quot;Rock Island&quot; traffic to connect onto the north-west-bound &quot;Santa Fe&quot; tracks. This is the only way for the Santa Fe traffic to travel north-west after removing the tracks to Neva.

===20th century===
The National Old Trails Road, also known as the Ocean-to-Ocean Highway, was established in 1912, and was routed through Lehigh, Hillsboro, Marion, Lost Springs.

<text>Marion is a city in and the county seat of Marion County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 1,922. The city was named in honor of Francis Marion, a brigadier general of the American Revolutionary War, known as the &quot;Swamp Fox&quot;.
==History==

===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===

In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1806, Zebulon Pike led the Pike Expedition westward from St Louis, Missouri, of which part of their journey followed the Cottonwood River through Marion County near the current cities of Florence, Marion, Durham.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1855, Marion County was established within Kansas, which included the land for modern day Marion.

The city of Marion Centre was founded in 1860 and became the county seat, named in honor of Francis Marion. A post office was established on September 30, 1862, which shortened the name to Marion on October 15, 1881. The city officially adopted the shorter name on January 17, 1882. In 1875, Marion incorporated as a city as a 3rd class city, later in 1888 it became a 2nd class city.
As early as 1875, city leaders of Marion held a meeting to consider a branch railroad from Florence. In 1878, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and parties from Marion County and McPherson County chartered the Marion and McPherson Railway Company. In 1879, a branch line was built from Florence to McPherson, in 1880 it was extended to Lyons, in 1881 it was extended to Ellinwood. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to Marion, was abandoned in 1968. In 1992, the line from Marion to McPherson was sold to Central Kansas Railway. In 1993, after heavy flood damage, the line from Marion to McPherson was abandoned. The original branch line connected Florence, Marion, Canada, Hillsboro, Lehigh, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Conway, Windom, Little River, Mitchell, Lyons, Chase, Ellinwood. Later, the Santa Fe depot building was converted into the Marion Library. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Santa Fe&quot;.

In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a branch line north-south from Herington through Marion to Caldwell. It foreclosed in 1891 and was taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980 and reorganized as Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad, merged in 1988 with Missouri Pacific Railroad, and finally merged in 1997 with Union Pacific Railroad. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Rock Island&quot;.

In 1889, the Marion Belt and Chingawasa Springs Railroad built a railroad from Marion north-east to Chingawasa Springs. A hotel was built near the site of the spa at Chingawasa Springs, and a depot and eatery as well. Both Santa Fe and Rock Island offered round trip fares from Chicago and western cities to Chingawasa Springs. An economic panic in 1893 closed down the health spa and hotel, and quarry business along the tracks never developed sufficiently. In 1893, the railroad ceased operations, and tracks were removed in 1910.

===20th century===

The National Old Trails Road, also known as the Ocean-to-Ocean Highway, was established in 1912, and was routed through Lehigh, Hillsboro, Marion and Lost Springs.

In 1937, the Marion County Lake was completed by the Civilian Conservation Corps south-east of Marion for the purpose of recreation. There were numerous floods during the early history of Marion. In June and July 1951, due to heavy rains, rivers and streams flooded numerous cities in Kansas, including Marion. Many reservoirs and levees were built in Kansas as part of a response to the Great Flood of 1951. From 1964 to 1968, the Marion Reservoir was constructed north-west of Marion. Downstream from the Marion Reservoir, levees were built in the low areas of Marion and Florence.

===21st century===
====2023 newspaper raid====
In August 2023, Marion County police raided the newspaper &quot;Marion County Record&quot;, its owners, and a local city council member. The police had received information that the paper had obtained, allegedly from a confidential source (it was later shown that legal public sources were used) that a local business owner had an unresolved drunk driving conviction and continued to drive for many months without a driving license. The newspaper did not publish this legally obtained information.

<text>Peabody is a city in Marion County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 937. The city was named after F.H. Peabody of Boston, former vice-president of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. Peabody is well known in the region for its Independence Day Celebration on July 4, and its historic 1880s downtown main street. It is located between Newton and Florence along U.S. Route 50 highway.
==History==
===Early history===

For millennia the Great Plains of North America were inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th to 18th centuries, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, by the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1801 to 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized under the provisions of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1855, Marion County was established, which included the land for modern day Peabody.

In 1864, the first settler in the Peabody area was W.C. Coble, from North Carolina, who set up ranch headquarters about 2+ miles east of the current city of Peabody (now section 36 of Catlin Township). The first settlement made in the area was in September 1870, by a colony of settlers from Wisconsin. In October, more settlers arrived. During the first month, the colony officers laid out a town on the north-half of section 4 township 22 and surveyed it into lots. The town was named Coneburg after the town company president John Cone. The town site was located between the current 9th Street and Division Avenue. During the winter of 1870, some of the settlers returned east to get supplies and bring out their families. In 1871, while the other settlers were gone, dissatisfaction arose in the community and it began to break up. Claim jumping of the Coneburg town site and nearby land started to occur, thus causing a legal mess.

In 1870, T.M. Potter homesteaded the south-half of the same section of land. In spring of 1871, he and five other men started the Peabody town company. Since the land title for the Peabody town site had no legal disputes, businesses immediately moved from Coneburg. In June 1871, the town of Peabody was platted, and it included the land where the railroad was built on June 9.

A post office was established in Coneburg on January 25, 1871 then moved to Peabody on October 30, 1871.

In April 1872 during legal disputes, Coneburg became North Peabody. A revised plat of Peabody was made in July 1875 and a supplemental plat of North Peabody was made in April 1878. Because of the disputes, the street that ran down the middle of the border between the two towns was called &quot;Division Avenue.&quot; The two towns merged into the city of Peabody in 1879.

The town of Peabody was named in 1871 after F.H. Peabody, of Boston, formerly vice-president of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway company. In May 1874, Mr. Peabody visited the new town, at which time he announced he would donate money for a library building, furniture, books, periodicals and landscaping if the Peabody township would secure four town lots for the site. The contract for construction was awarded in spring of 1875 and was opened to the public in June 1875, and the following February 1876 the state legislature authorized the township to levy a tax to support the library. The structure housed the library facilities until 1914 when a new Peabody Township Carnegie Library was constructed on the old location.
In 1871, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway extended a main line from Emporia through Peabody to Newton. In 1996 it merged with Burlington Northern Railroad and renamed to the current BNSF Railway. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Santa Fe&quot;. The first depot was built south of the tracks. Later a train wreck destroyed it and a second depot was built on the north side of the tracks. In 1873, three westbound trains (9:05am, 1:00pm, 8:30pm) and three eastbound trains (4:42am, 6:50pm, 8:30pm) stopped at the Peabody depot. Rail service was still very strong five decades later. In 1925, three westbound and four eastbound trains made stops at Peabody. The second depot was demolished in the 1970s after passenger transportation ended, then its land was converted into the Santa Fe Park, which is located at the south end of Walnut Street. Currently Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; passenger train currently passes through Peabody twice each day, but stops at nearby Newton.

During most of the 1870s, the railway depots in Peabody and Florence were the only access points for train passengers into Marion County and northern Butler County. Peabody was a destination for numerous foreign homesteaders, including the Mennonite settlers around Goessel and Gnadenau.

In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built the &quot;Rock Island&quot; branch line north–south from Herington through Peabody and Wichita to Caldwell. By 1893, this branch line was incrementally built to Fort Worth, Texas. It foreclosed in 1891 and was taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980 and reorganized as Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad. The company merged in 1988 with Missouri Pacific Railroad finally merging in 1997 with Union Pacific Railroad. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Rock Island&quot;. Its depot in Peabody was demolished in the early 1960s.

In 1875, Peabody held its first agricultural &quot;county fair&quot; and continued to hold them annually for many years. In September 1885, the Kansas State Fair was held at Peabody during the first four days of the month. An outstanding feature of the state fair was &quot;the First Monument to General Grant&quot;, who died shortly before the fair. The temporary monument was an obelisk about tall, and built from forty bushels of ears of corn. The fair had a grandstand, which could hold 2000 people, to view horse races. The race track was used for a variety of events, including horse walking teams in harness, trotting, running, pacing, mule racing, and daily chariot races. A dining hall was built that was capable of feeding 10,000 people each day. In 1900, the Marion County Agricultural Society sold the fair grounds to the city, which renamed it the Peabody City Park, and its entrance is located at the corner of Locust and 2nd Streets.

Peabody was the home of famous race horses around the turn of the century. Three of the more famous horses were world champions. Joe Young (known as the &quot;iron horse&quot;) sold for $10,000 by C.E. Westbrook, the first horse west of the Mississippi River to sell for such a high price. Joe Young sired Joe Patchen in 1889, who earned his owner $40,000 in race purses and then was sold for $44,000. Joe Patchen sired Dan Patch in 1896, a horse that sold in 1907 for $60,000. Other famous local racing horses included trotters McKinney, and Silver Sign. Silverthorne toured Austria where he competed for three years against the best race horses in Europe.

===20th century===

Peabody became an important supply point for one of the state&#x27;s cattle feeding districts. By 1911, approximately 20,000 head of cattle were imported from other states and fed within of Peabody at 50 farms. Because of the cattle industry, local farmers grew more corn, alfalfa, and other feed crops during the 1900s and 1910s.

Peabody and Watchorn areas experienced an oil boom from 1918 to 1920 in the oil fields of the Mid-Continent oil province. The influence of the petroleum industry remained strong in Peabody, and resulted in the greatest change upon the community in the shortest time. More than 100 residences were constructed in October and November 1919. From 1918 to 1919, the population increased by 75% or more, but later decreased as oil booms in other Kansas areas needed the workers. Currently Watchorn is a ghost town consisting of oil wells but no remaining historical structures.

The New Santa Fe Trail road was routed through Peabody in the late 1910s. The road entered the north-east side of the city on Old Mill Rd, and exited on the south-west side on 60th Street (known as the &quot;Old Trail&quot;). The trail became U.S. Route 50 in the late 1930s when the new highway was routed east to west on 9th Street. In 1998, the highway was moved about 1.5 blocks north so it could go over a new railroad overpass.

In 1943, German and Italian prisoners of World War II were brought to Kansas and other midwest states as a means of solving the labor shortage caused by American men serving in the war effort. Large prisoner-of-war camps camps were established in Kansas at Camp Concordia, Camp Funston (at Fort Riley), and Camp Phillips (at Salina under Fort Riley). Fort Riley established 12 smaller branch camps, including Peabody and El Dorado. Up to 150 prisoners were quartered at the Peabody branch camp. Farmers were to have first priority over other industries in requesting prisoner labor. County agents were responsible for processing the application of local residents seeking the use of the prisoners who were to be available only as group laborers. No fewer than four prisoners could be assigned to a farm, and a guard accompanied each group, but later it was common for no guards to accompany the prisoners. The prisoners were not allowed to operate any powered farm equipment. The farmer collected the workers at the camp and returned them at the end of each day. The Peabody branch camp #101 was located in the Eyestone building, now occupied by Heckendorn Equipment Company, and located at 122 West 2nd Street. The prisoner yard was located in the north-east corner of the property and still exists as a storage area. The camp was closed in December 1945, after Germany surrendered.

There have been numerous floods during the history of Peabody. In June and July 1951, due to heavy rains, rivers and streams flooded numerous cities in Kansas, including Peabody. Many reservoirs and levees were built in Kansas as part of a response to the Great Flood of 1951.

The community gradually increased in size as a commuter town to support aircraft industries in Wichita during World War II and Soviet Union Cold War years. Over time the aircraft industry worker requirement has shrank, thus has their influence on numerous commuter towns. Another gradual impact on the community has been the decrease in the size of farm families. Over time as farm equipment has increased in size, so has it decreased the number of family farms in the area, because fewer people are required to farm larger amounts of land. Fewer farms families has led to a gradual decrease in children at local schools. Peabody, like most rural towns, has seen a gradual loss of population due to rural flight to larger cities.

The community has long had great pride in celebrating and promoting its past. Three centennials, the Kansas centennial in 1961, the Peabody centennial in 1971, and the United States Bicentennial in 1976 caused surges of historic pride. It led to the creation of the Peabody Main Street Association (PMSA) in 1989 and the Peabody Community Foundation (PCF). The Peabody Main Street Association has won numerous awards since it was founded.

In 1998, the downtown area of Peabody was placed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), and known as the Peabody Downtown Historic District. Peabody had four previous listings on the NRHP: Peabody Historical Library Museum (in 1973), Peabody Township Library (in 1987), J.S. Schroeder Building (in 1991), and W.H. Morgan House (in 1996).

===21st century===
In 2010, the Peabody Main Street Association received 5 state awards. In the same year, the Keystone-Cushing Pipeline (Phase II) was constructed east of Peabody, north to south through Marion County. There was quite a bit of controversy over road damage, tax exemption, and environmental concerns (if a leak ever occurs).

In 2012, the Peabody City Park was placed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), the sixth in Peabody.

==== History ====
The first school in Peabody was organized in 1871. The first school building, two stone rooms, was built in 1872. The first high school classes were taught in 1879, and the first graduation class in 1881 consisted of 2 students. In 1923, a new high school was built at 900 North Walnut Street. In 1946–1947, the &quot;School Reorganization Act&quot; consolidated many one-room rural schools into the Peabody school district. In 1953, the &quot;Brown Building&quot; was built to house a larger gymnasium, band / lunch room, and vocational agriculture rooms. In 1965, the Burns and Summit school districts were unified with Peabody to form Unified School District 398. The Summit school and Burns High School were closed. In 1996–1997, the current high school was built (and attached) to the south side the existing &quot;Brown Building&quot; at 810 North Sycamore Street. Soon afterward, the former 1923 high school across the street was demolished and converted into a football practice field. The Burns Grade School, which included a junior high, was closed. Currently all students in USD 398 attend schools in Peabody.

===Library===
Each USD 398 school has a library for student access.

The city is served by the Peabody Township Carnegie Library at 214 North Walnut Street. The library was established in 1874, a Carnegie library since 1914, was the first free tax-supported library in Kansas. As of 2018, the library has a 50 Mbps fiber optic internet connection; patrons are able to access it with five library computers or free Wi-Fi access using their own device.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

====Rail====
Two railroads, BNSF Railway and Union Pacific Railroad, pass through the city. The BNSF Railway runs east–west through the city and has a spur for grain cars at the east Mid Kansas Co-Op. Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; passenger train travels on the BNSF Railway but stops at nearby Newton. The Oklahoma Kansas Texas (OKT) line of the Union Pacific Railroad runs north–south through the city and has a spur for grain cars at the west Mid Kansas Co-Op. The two railroads cross each other as a Level junction, and a rarely used connection between the two railroads allows eastbound BNSF trains to turn onto the northbound Union Pacific railroad. Both railways had depots which were previously in Peabody, but were demolished in the 1960s and 1970s.

====Highways====
 U.S. Highway 50 passes through the northern edge of the city and follows roughly parallel to the BNSF Railway.

In the early years of the highway before U.S. Route 50 was finalized in the 1930s, the highway was known as the New Santa Fe Trail, which entered the north side of the city on Newell Road (later on Old Mill Road), and exited on the south-western side on 60th Street (known as the &quot;Old Trail&quot;). In fall 1933, an underpass on 9th street (50S) was constructed to go under the Rock Island Railroad as part of the New Deal highway program during the Great Depression. Until the late 1950s, U.S. Route 50 was split into two routes through central Kansas. The routes were called 50N and 50S, and the highway through Peabody was 50S. From the 1930s to 1998, the highway was routed east to west through Peabody on 9th Street, then a bypass and overpass were built approximately 1.5 blocks north to avoid a dangerous underpass which went under the Union Pacific Railroad.

The Kansas Department of Transportation proposed that U.S. Route 50 should be converted into a four-lane expressway from Emporia to western Kansas. In the meantime, additional passing lanes may be added.

<text>Ramona is a city in Marion County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 78. The city name is a Spanish name. It is located southwest of Herington next to a railroad.
==History==
===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1855, Marion County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Ramona.

The city name Ramona is a Spanish name. Land ownership of the Ramona area dates back when the area belonged to Spain. Manuel De Lisa, a New Orleans merchant, petitioned his government for a large land grant in the Ramona area on July 16, 1799.

In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a main line from Herington through Ramona to Pratt. In 1888, this line was extended to Liberal. Later, it was extended to Tucumcari, New Mexico and El Paso, Texas. It foreclosed in 1891 and taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980 and reorganized as Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad, merged in 1988 with Missouri Pacific Railroad, and finally merged in 1997 with Union Pacific Railroad. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Rock Island&quot;.

A post office was established in Ramona on August 9, 1887.

===21st century===
In 2010, the Keystone-Cushing Pipeline (Phase II) was constructed near Ramona, north to south through Marion County, with much controversy over road damage, tax exemption, and environmental concerns (if a leak ever occurs).

==Geography==
Ramona is located in the scenic Flint Hills and Great Plains of the state of Kansas.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The county line lies 0.5 mile north of Ramona.

<text>Tampa is a city in Marion County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census the population of the city was 105. It is located between Durham and Ramona and is next to a railroad.
==History==
===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

From the 1820s to the 1870s, one of the most significant land routes in the United States was the Santa Fe Trail. It was located along the edge of what would become Tampa. Two Santa Fe Trail markers were located on the trail near Tampa. The trail was active across Marion County from 1821 to 1866.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1855, Marion County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Tampa.

In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a main line from Herington through Tampa to Pratt. In 1888, this line was extended to Liberal. Later it was extended to Tucumcari, New Mexico and El Paso, Texas. It foreclosed in 1891 and was taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980 and reorganized as Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad. The company merged in 1988 with Missouri Pacific Railroad, and merged again in 1997 with Union Pacific Railroad. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Rock Island&quot;.

The Golden Belt Town Company filed the plat for Tampa in 1887. The source of the city name is said to have been suggested by a railroad engineer who rode one of the first trains through Tampa. Tampa was incorporated as a city in 1908.

A post office was established in Tampa on April 17, 1888.

<text>Blue Rapids is a city in Marshall County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 928.

==History==

The first endeavor to establish a town below the junction of the rivers, in 1857, failed due to misfortunes of two of the three participants. No further attempt to utilize the impressive water power was made until 1869–1870, when a colony of about 50 families from Genesee County, New York moved in, purchased land and water power rights, and began establishing a community. The Blue Rapids Town Company was formed, and by the end of 1870 the population was about 250. In 1872, Blue Rapids was incorporated as a city of third class under the statutes of Kansas.

Among the first projects in 1870 were a stone dam and a wrought iron bridge built on the Big Blue River. A hydroelectric power plant was then added to provide power for manufacturing and for the town. The power plant was destroyed by a flood in 1903. In the late 19th century and early 20th century there were four gypsum mines in the area. The population peaked around 1910 at over 1,750. The public library, built in 1875, is the oldest library west of the Mississippi in continuous operation in the same building.

Blue Rapids was the birthplace of the pancreatic cancer drug Streptozotocin. The bacterium from which the drug is derived was discovered in the late 1950s in a soil sample taken from &quot;an uncultivated sandy soil in a grassland region&quot; at Blue Rapids.

Blue Rapids claims to be the smallest town in the U.S. to have hosted a national league baseball game. On October 24, 1913, more than 3,000 fans watched the Chicago White Sox and New York Giants play a world tour exhibition game on the local ball field at Riverside Park that is still in use today. Blue Rapids was also home to minor league baseball. The 1910 Blue Rapids team played as members of the Class D level Eastern Kansas League.

In 2001, Blue Rapids became the site of a new NOAA Weather Radio transmitter, KZZ67, to provide weather and emergency information from the National Weather Service in Topeka, Kansas to residents of north-central and northeast Kansas.

In May 2012, &quot;The Monument to the Ice Age&quot; was dedicated in the town square. It features descriptions of Ice Age times, continental glaciers, and Sioux Quartzite glacial erratics -the oldest rocks in Kansas. The main reason for this Ice Age Monument is that Blue Rapids was founded in a place with abundant natural resources brought or created by the glaciers of the Ice Age over 10,000 years ago. The namesake rapids on the Blue River that were harnessed to power early industries, the sand and gravel deposits used for construction and roads, and the rich soils for agriculture are all here because of the Ice Age glaciers. The Monument honors this ancient geological heritage. Glacial erratic that was deposited in the glaciated region of Kansas during the Pleistocene era.

<text>Marysville is a city in and the county seat of Marshall County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 3,447.

==History==

Marysville was laid out in 1855 by Francis J. Marshall, and designated in that same year the county seat. It was incorporated as a city in 1861.

Marysville was located on the Oregon Trail and the route of the Pony Express, the St. Joe Road, the Overland Stage, The Military Road, and the Otoe-Missouria Trail. British explorer Richard Francis Burton en route to California in 1860 noted: &quot;Passing by Marysville, in old maps Palmetto City, a country-town which thrives by selling whiskey to ruffians of all descriptions ...&quot; The old Pony Express Station still stands in downtown Marysville. In &quot;Beyond the Mississippi&quot; (1867), Albert D. Richardson, who passed through Marysville in 1860, wrote that the town—which was named after the Border Ruffian Marshall&#x27;s wife—&quot;had 50 houses and was famed for whisky and shooting affrays.&quot;

Marysville owed much of its prosperity to the Union Pacific Railroad, which became a major employer. But as the city grew along the railroad most of the community was across the tracks from a good part of downtown. As rail traffic increased, vehicular delays were estimated at 7.5 to 8 hours per day at the five grade crossings, which also affected emergency vehicles. In 2006 the main line was moved out of the center of town to a bypass to the south and west, with grade separations for US-36 and US-77.

Marysville is also known as the &quot;Black Squirrel City&quot; due to an isolated community of all-black squirrels that make their homes in the town. The squirrels are said to be the result of escapees from a traveling circus.

==Geography==
Marysville is located in northeastern Kansas near the Nebraska border, approximately 75 miles (120 km) northwest of the Kansas capital of Topeka and 67 miles (108 km) south of Lincoln, Nebraska. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

<text>Canton is a city in McPherson County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 685. It is named after Canton, Ohio.

==History==
===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

From the 1820s to the 1870s, one of the most significant land routes in the United States was the Santa Fe Trail. It was located southeast of Canton. Two DAR markers were located on the trail near Canton, one at the Jones Cemetery east of Canton, and another south of Canton. The trail was active across McPherson County from 1821 to 1866.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1867, McPherson County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Canton.

As early as 1875, city leaders of Marion held a meeting to consider a branch railroad from Florence. In 1878, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and parties from Marion and McPherson counties chartered the Marion and McPherson Railway Company. In 1879, a branch line was built from Florence to McPherson; in 1880 it was extended to Lyons and in 1881 was extended to Ellinwood. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to Marion was abandoned in 1968. In 1992, the line from Marion to McPherson was sold to Central Kansas Railway. In 1993, after heavy flood damage, the line from Marion through Canton to McPherson was abandoned and removed. The original branch line connected Florence, Marion, Canada, Hillsboro, Lehigh, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Conway, Windom, Little River, Mitchell, Lyons, Chase and Ellinwood.

After the railroad was built through the area in 1879, a village was established that grew to over 300 inhabitants, then was incorporated as a city in 1880 and named after Canton, Ohio because an early settler came from Ohio.

In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a main line from Herington through Canton to Pratt. In 1888, this line was extended to Liberal. Later, it was extended to Tucumcari, New Mexico and El Paso, Texas. It foreclosed in 1891 and taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980 and reorganized as Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad, merged in 1988 with Missouri Pacific Railroad, merged in 1997 with Union Pacific Railroad. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Rock Island&quot;.

Here 200 head of bison and 50 elk roam free. It was established in 1859 by John Gault Maxwell to allow future generations to experience Kansas as it was in the 1800s, prior to settlement. This refuge is owned and managed by the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks.
* Canton has two water towers, labeled &quot;HOT&quot; (in red) and &quot;COLD&quot; (in blue). The words were painted on as a tourist attraction in 1956 at the suggestion of local real estate agent Mrs. M.D. Fisher. In fact, both tanks hold water at an ambient temperature.

== Popular culture ==
On July 21, 2008, Stephen Colbert made a comment on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; about John McCain making a campaign stop in Canton, Ohio, and &quot;not the crappy Canton in Georgia.&quot; The comment resulted in a local uproar, which prompted Stephen to apologize for the story during his July 30, 2008, show, insisting that he was incorrect and that the &quot;real&quot; crappy Canton was Canton, Kansas, after which he made several jokes at the town&#x27;s expense. Reaction from Mayor Brad Smiley and local residents was negative and Kansas governor Kathleen Sebelius invited Colbert to &quot;spend a night&quot; in Canton&#x27;s historic jail. On August 5, 2008, Colbert apologized to citizens of Canton, Kansas, then continued the running gag by directing his mock derision in successive weeks towards Canton, South Dakota and Canton, Texas. On October 28, Colbert turned his attention back to Canton, Ohio after Barack Obama made a campaign stop there, forcing Colbert to find it &quot;crappy&quot;.

<text>Galva is a city in McPherson County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 834.

==History==
===Early history===

For millennia, the Great Plains of North America were inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th to 18th centuries, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, by the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

From the 1820s to 1870s, the Santa Fe Trail passed through, what is now McPherson County. In 1855, Charles O. Fuller established a ranch adjacent to the Running Turkey Creek Crossing about two miles south and one mile east of Galva. Fuller&#x27;s Ranch provided accommodations for travelers on the Santa Fe Trail and was probably the first white settlement in McPherson County. The location is on private property with a marker nearby. The trail was active across McPherson County from 1821 to 1866.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1867, McPherson County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Galva.

As early as 1875, city leaders of Marion held a meeting to consider a branch railroad from Florence. In 1878, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and parties from Marion and McPherson counties chartered the Marion and McPherson Railway Company. In 1879, a branch line was built from Florence to McPherson; in 1880, it was extended to Lyons and in 1881 was extended to Ellinwood. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to Marion became defunct in 1968. In 1992, the line from Marion to McPherson was sold to Central Kansas Railway. In 1993, after heavy flood damage, the line from Marion through Galva to McPherson was abandoned and removed. The original branch line connected Florence, Marion, Canada, Hillsboro, Lehigh, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Conway, Windom, Little River, Mitchell, Lyons, Chase and Ellinwood.

In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a main line from Herington through Galva to Pratt. In 1888, this line was extended to Liberal. Later, it was extended to Tucumcari, New Mexico and El Paso, Texas. It foreclosed in 1891 and taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980 and reorganized as Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad, merged in 1988 with Missouri Pacific Railroad, merged in 1997 with Union Pacific Railroad. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Rock Island&quot;.

Galva was named by Mrs. J. E. Doyle, a native of Galva, Illinois. Galva was laid out on land belonging to the Marion &amp; McPherson Railroad Company in September 1879, and it served as a shipping point for grain and cattle. By 1883, it contained nearly 100 people, several general stores, one drug store, one hotel, one lumber yard, a hotel and livery stable, and a good schoolhouse.

<text>Lindsborg is a city in McPherson County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, its population was 3,776. Lindsborg is known for its large Swedish, other Nordic and Scandinavian heritages. It is home to the biennial Svensk Hyllningsfest.

==History==

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America were inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th to the 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France for 2.83 cents per acre as part of the 828,000 square-mile Louisiana Purchase.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized and in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. McPherson County, which included the land for the future Lindsborg, was established in 1867. Lindsborg was settled in the spring of 1869 by a group of immigrants from the Värmland province of Sweden led by Pastor Olof Olsson. In 1879, the same year Lindsborg incorporated as a city, the first railroad came through.

Lindsborg translates as &quot;Linden Castle&quot; from Swedish to English, referring to a tree name known in Europe for a species of &quot;tilia&quot; (Swedish: &quot;lind&quot;). The community is named for four men whose surnames included &quot;Lind&quot;, N. P. Linde, S. P. Lindgren, S. A. Lindell, and J. O. Lindh, who had held prominent positions in a Chicago organization of Swedish farmers (&quot;Svenska Lantbrukskompaniet&quot; or First Swedish Agricultural Company) which was involved in the settling of Lindsborg until 1877.

Thirty percent of the current residents are of Swedish descent. Because the town has retained so much of the heritage of its founders, it has become known as &quot;Little Sweden&quot;. The downtown features gift shops that specialize in Swedish souvenirs, including various sizes of Dala horses. Lindsborg has long been noted for the Svensk Hyllningsfest, a biennial celebration held in October of odd-numbered years since 1941, and other efforts to honor its heritage.

Lindsborg is the home of the Swedish Pavilion, which was originally constructed as an international exposition building for the 1904 St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair. After the fair, it was purchased by W. W. Thomas, U.S. Minister to Sweden and Norway, and presented to Lindsborg&#x27;s Bethany College as a memorial to his friend Dr. Rev. Carl Aaron Swensson, the school&#x27;s recently deceased founder. At Bethany, it was used by the art department as a classroom, library, and museum. It was moved to the Lindsborg Old Mill &amp; Swedish Heritage Museum, also in Lindsborg, in 1969.

The Birger Sandzén Memorial Gallery is located in Lindsborg. Dedicated on October 20, 1957, on the Bethany College campus, it showcases the works of the artist Birger Sandzén who lived in the city. The gallery houses the largest and most extensive collection of his paintings, prints, and drawings found anywhere in the world.

Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf visited Lindsborg in April 1976 during his royal tour of the United States.

In 2004, Lindsborg was named Chess City of the Year by the United States Chess Federation.

<text>Marquette is a city in McPherson County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 599. It is located between K-4 and the Smoky Hill River.

==History==
For millennia, the land now known as Kansas was inhabited by Native Americans. In 1803, most of modern Kansas was secured by the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1867, McPherson County was founded.

In 1873, what eventually would become Marquette began on the banks of the Smoky Hill River with a flour mill. The site was surveyed and on February 9, 1874, the town was chartered. It was settled by Swedish immigrants and Civil War veterans. It was named after Marquette, Michigan. Marquette was located on the Missouri Pacific Railroad.

On the night of May 8–9, 1905, an F4 tornado destroyed much of the town, killing 34 people. Many homes in town were blown away and entire families were killed.

On April 14, 2012, a large EF4 tornado would pass to the west of Marquette, sweeping a home away leaving an empty foundation and a small staircase, and there were no fatalities or injuries. Damage at this location would be the most severe near or in the small community of Langley.

==Geography==
Marquette is located in the Smoky Hills region of Kansas. The area is highlighted by outcrops of Cretaceous-era sandstone known as the Dakota Formation. Erosion of those strata has left hills and buttes which rise sharply about the surrounding plains.

Fifty acres (200,000 m2) of what used to be farmland were developed, furnished with gravel streets, water, electric, sewer and gas hookups. In less than one year, twenty-one of the ⅓ acre (1,300 m2) lots created for this purpose were claimed.

<text>McPherson ( ) is a city in and the county seat of McPherson County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 14,082. The city is named after Union General James Birdseye McPherson, a Civil War general. It is home to McPherson College and Central Christian College.

==History==
===19th century===
For millennia, the land now known as Kansas was inhabited by Native Americans. In 1803, most of modern Kansas was secured by the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1867, McPherson County was founded.

McPherson was founded in 1870 by the twelve members of the McPherson Town Company. In 1887, city officials began a failed attempt to have the community named the state capital.

The first post office in McPherson was established in 1873. McPherson was incorporated as a city in 1874.

As early as 1875, city leaders of Marion held a meeting to consider a branch railroad from Florence. In 1878, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and parties from Marion and McPherson counties chartered the Marion and McPherson Railway Company. In 1879, a branch line was built from Florence to McPherson. In 1880 it was extended to Lyons and in 1881 it was extended to Ellinwood. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to Marion was abandoned in 1968. In 1992, the line from Marion to McPherson was sold to Central Kansas Railway. In 1993, after heavy flood damage, the line from Marion to McPherson was abandoned. The original branch line connected Florence, Marion, Canada, Hillsboro, Lehigh, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Conway, Windom, Little River, Mitchell, Lyons, Chase and Ellinwood.

In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a main line from Herington through McPherson to Pratt. In 1888, this line was extended to Liberal. Later, it was extended to Tucumcari, New Mexico and El Paso, Texas. It foreclosed in 1891 and taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980 and reorganized as Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad, merged in 1988 with Missouri Pacific Railroad, merged in 1997 with Union Pacific Railroad. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Rock Island&quot;.

By 1888, the community was at the junction of four railroad lines. Major industries have included a large flour mill, an insurance company headquarters, and an oil refinery.

===20th century===

The National Old Trails Road, also known as the Ocean-to-Ocean Highway, was established in 1912, and was routed through Windom, Conway and McPherson.

In the 1930s, the local refinery sponsored the McPherson Globe Refiners basketball team (AAU). They were coached by Gene Johnson, former head coach of Wichita University (now Wichita State University). The Refiners were best known for their tall centers, Joe Fortenberry (6–8) and Willard Schmidt (6–9) and their fast-break style of play. Billed as &quot;The Tallest Team in the World&quot;, the Refiners often held their opponents to low scores because of the centers&#x27; ability to deflect shots on the way to the basket in what today would be called goaltending. Coach Johnson was one of the innovators of the fast break and full-court press. The Refiners won the AAU national championship in 1936 against the Hollywood Universal team. This earned them the right to compete for the first ever USA Olympic basketball team in 1936. Hollywood Universal narrowly beat the Refiners at Madison Square Garden and the USA team was composed of both Universal and Refiners players and one college student. Coach Johnson was selected to be the assistant coach. After a long journey by boat to Europe, the team played in alternating squads at the Olympics. The Refiners&#x27; portion of the team took the court to defeat Canada 19–8 in the gold medal game on August 14, 1936, at the Summer Olympics. The Refiners&#x27; home court is now the McPherson Community Building at 121 East Marlin and can be toured by contacting the local Convention and Visitors Bureau. A mural in honor of the Refiners was completed in 2010 at the intersection of Kansas and Ash, south of their home court in preparation for the 75th anniversary celebration of their victory in 2011.

It feeds the Lakeside Park Lagoon before crossing under East Euclid Street and Kansas Avenue, where it then forms Wall Park Lake.

South and west of town are four units of the reclaimed McPherson Valley Wetlands, acquired and managed by Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks, Ducks Unlimited, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

These wetlands continue to see improvement and development.

==History==
===Early history===

For millennia, the Great Plains of North America were inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th to the 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, under the terms of the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land that comprises modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized under the provisions of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th US state. In 1867, McPherson County was established, which included the land for modern day Moundridge.

In 1876, the community was founded with the name Christian. In 1887, it was renamed and incorporated as Moundridge on account of the elevation of the town site.

Between 1874 and 1880, of the approximately 45,000 Mennonites who had been living in South Russia, 10,000 departed for the United States and 8,000 for Manitoba. Available cropland in the central United States was similar to that in their homelands in the Crimean Peninsula. Since the central part of the state was settled, Kansas has enjoyed the reputation as the top wheat-producing state. Settlers in central Kansas, experienced in Russian methods of dryland farming and flour milling, introduced winter wheat in 1873 and quickly saw their industry become dominant. The museums in nearby Hillsboro and Goessel demonstrate the lives and times of these early settlers.

Almost all of the original settlers of McPherson County spoke German, many exclusively. With the coming of the automobile and the importance of commercial participation with the English-speaking citizens, the use of German diminished in importance. The participation of the United States in World Wars I and II dramatically increased the use of English and by the early 1940s, ministers rarely preached in German. As of the year 2000, a very small number of German religious publications are available, primarily for use by elderly congregants.

<text>Windom is a city in McPherson County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 85.

==History==

===19th century===

For millennia, the land now known as Kansas was inhabited by Native Americans. In 1803, most of modern Kansas was secured by the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1867, McPherson County was founded.

In 1878, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and parties from Marion and McPherson counties chartered the Marion and McPherson Railway Company. In 1879, a branch line was built from Florence to McPherson; in 1880 it was extended to Lyons and in 1881 was extended to Ellinwood. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to Marion, was abandoned in 1968. In 1992, the line from Marion to McPherson was sold to Central Kansas Railway. In 1993, after heavy flood damage, the line from Marion to McPherson was abandoned. The original branch line connected Florence, Marion, Canada, Hillsboro, Lehigh, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Conway, Windom, Little River, Mitchell, Lyons, Chase and Ellinwood.

Some hold that Windom was named in honor of William Windom, while others believe its namesake is Windham County, Connecticut.

==Education==
The community is served by Prairie View USD 362 public school district. Students from grades 6–12 attend Prairie View Middle School or Prairie View High School in La Cygne.

Previously, Fontana Elementary was located in Fontana, having a total enrollment of approximately 100 students from kindergarten through fifth grades. In approximately 2011, the Prairie View School Board expressed an interest in replacing or remodeling Fontana Elementary. Various proposals were made, including one to build a new school close to Prairie View Middle School, but the Board eventually settled on a decision to expand nearby Parker Elementary, which was part of Prairie View along with Fontana. The school ceased operations in May 2014, with the end of the school year, and all the students were moved to Parker Elementary. The school building has since been sold to private owners.

<text>Louisburg is a city in Miami County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 4,969.

==History==

===19th century===
Prior to the American Civil War, the land of what is now called Louisburg was part of an area reserved for members of various tribes of Native Americans who were ceding their lands in Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana. Settling there were the Peoria, Wea, Piankeshaw, and Kaskaskia tribes which together eventually became the Confederated Tribe of Peoria. Traders and missionaries often visited the area, and by 1854 Euro-American farmers began moving nearby, establishing homes.
Upon the organization of the state of Kansas in 1861, the Confederated Tribes were being charged with taxes, and the new state laws conflicted with their own. By 1866, following the Civil War, the government moved the Confederated Tribe of Peoria to Oklahoma, and the land they once occupied was sold to settlers. A community of homes resulted by 1867, and was called St. Louis. Soon, it was often referred to as New St. Louis or Little St. Louis in an effort to distinguish it from St. Louis.

From 1868 to 1870, the settlement of Little St. Louis grew to include businesses and churches, and a railroad depot was to be completed. Because the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas Railroad (MKT Railroad) would be coming to serve the community, and to avoid additional confusion, Little St. Louis was renamed Louisburg in 1870. The railroad depot was completed by 1871, and Louisburg&#x27;s first school opened the same year. The community had some disorder during this time. As a town near the border, there remained conflicts between Kansas Jayhawkers and Missouri Raiders. In addition, the railroad tracks running through the community divided it into north and south areas. &quot;Circa&quot; 1875, many businesses and homes were moved from north of the railroad to the south, and formed what was to become downtown Louisburg.

Louisburg was incorporated as a city of the third class November 3, 1882, and held its first city election two weeks later on November 17, 1882. The population was listed as 400, and 141 of those residents voted in the first election.

===20th century===
In the early 1900s, Louisburg&#x27;s downtown had a variety of businesses such as retail stores, supply stores, livery stables, a hotel, and large nurseries. By 1910 the population was 603, and Louisburg was known as a good supply town for agricultural districts. By the 1920s, the town also had a gas station, an automobile ownership and traffic through town had increased. By the late 1950s the MKT Railroad ended its service to Louisburg, but because K-68 went through town and US Highway 69 and K-68 intersected near town, growth continued.

In October 1912, an unsolved murder in the community took place as the town&#x27;s postmaster at the time, George McElheny, was shot twice by a 12-gauge shotgun at his home. Several people were accused of the murder, including his wife, after she admitted an affair with one of the accused, but after intense trials and no hard evidence the case was dropped, and no one ever admitted to the murder. In later years, the murder was almost forgotten until Joe Towne, one of the community leaders, grew interested in the subject and studied it and interviewed those who remembered the tragic situation and wrote true crime novel, &quot;Tongues on Fire&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

==Area attractions==
===&quot;Little Round House&quot;===
&quot;The Little Round House&quot; was originally an addition to a front porch for a Victorian-style house in the nearby town of Paola, and was called such because it was indeed round in shape. Because of increased truck traffic from Missouri on K-68 through town, Louisburg was contacted by the State of Kansas about needing an inspection station. As a solution, the Little Round House was moved to Louisburg in the 1930s to serve as a border checkpoint office. As years passed, the Little Round House became a home to a variety of small businesses, and had been used as temporary housing during World War II. The shape and size aided in it becoming a landmark to Louisburg. In 2005, The Little Round House was moved from its original location to the Louisburg City Lake, and has been restored by the community due to its historical value to the town.

===Frontier Military Scenic Byway===
Along the west side of Louisburg and close to U.S. Route 69 runs part of the Frontier Military Scenic Byway, a -long route from near Leavenworth to the border of Oklahoma. The byway closely follows a road originally built between 1838 and 1844 that was used to transport soldiers and supplies from Fort Leavenworth in Kansas to Fort Scott in Kansas and to Fort Gibson in Oklahoma.

<text>Osawatomie is a city in Miami County, Kansas, United States, southwest of Kansas City. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 4,255. It derives its name as a portmanteau of two nearby streams, the Marais des Cygnes River (formerly named &quot;Osage River&quot;) and Pottawatomie Creek.

==History==
Osawatomie&#x27;s name is a compound of two primary Native American tribes from the area, the Osage and Pottawatomie. The town is bordered by Pottawatomie Creek and the Marais des Cygnes River (part of the Osage River system), which are also named for the two tribes.

The Emigrant Aid Society&#x27;s transport of settlers to the Kansas Territory as a base for Free State settlers was key in the establishment of the community of Osawatomie in October 1854. Settled by abolitionists in hope of aiding Kansas&#x27;s entry to the United States as a free state, the community of Osawatomie and pro-slavery communities nearby was quickly the targets of violence by pro-enslavement forces such as Border Ruffians.

In March 1855, abolitionists Reverend Samuel Adair and his wife Florella settled in a cabin near Osawatomie to serve as missionaries to the community. Florella&#x27;s half-brother, John Brown came to Bleeding Kansas later the same year with a wagon of guns in order to help fight the pro slavery forces like his five sons, who were already living in another community in the area. Brown then came to Osawatomie to visit the Adairs and fight pro-slavery forces there. By 1856, having established himself as a leader of free state guerillas, Brown made Osawatomie and the Adair cabin his base. In a raid in May 1856, Brown killed five pro-slavery men along Pottawatomie Creek near the current town of Lane, Kansas. This was then referred to as the &quot;Pottawatomie massacre&quot;, which inflamed the fighting throughout the Kansas Territory. The second and main Battle of Osawatomie took place on August 30, 1856. Osawatomie played a key role throughout the Civil War, serving as a center for Jayhawker activity.

By 1857, Osawatomie had grown to a town of 800 and in 1859 hosted the first convention of the Kansas Republican Party. In recognition for Osawatomie&#x27;s part in ensuring Kansas remained a free state, the Kansas Legislature established the Osawatomie State Mental Hospital in 1863, the first mental hospital west of the Mississippi River. It admitted its first patient in 1866, and is still operational. By 1879, a railroad was built to serve Osawatomie, aiding its growth into a supply town and a main shipping point. As a result, Osawatomie grew to a population of 4,046 by 1910. Osawatomie was a division point for the Missouri Pacific Railroad and the Union Pacific Railroad from 1879 to 1985.

Osawatomie was chartered in 1883 and in 1890 became a second-class city. The commission form of government was adopted in 1914.

===Battle of Osawatomie===

The first skirmish in Osawatomie took place on June 7, 1856. However, there was not much of a fight, and no blood was shed. The town&#x27;s buildings were plundered, and some horses were taken. The larger, and main conflict known as the Battle of Osawatomie began August 30, 1856 as John Brown was camped just north Osawatomie and looking east for pro-slavery forces. A pro-slavery force of 250, led by John William Reid, came riding into Osawatomie from another direction. One of John Brown&#x27;s sons Frederick Brown was walking to the Adair cabin at the time, and was shot. When Reverend Adair heard the shot, he sent his own son to warn and notify John Brown of the raid. Brown and 31 of the free state guerillas took positions to attempt to defend Osawatomie. Heavy gunfire took place for over 45 minutes, until Brown and his men ran out of ammunition. They retreated hoping they would be chased, and the community of Osawatomie would be left alone. However, despite the attempts of Brown to get Reid&#x27;s men to follow, they instead looted and burned Osawatomie. Only three buildings remained standing when it was over.

===Presidential visits===

On August 31, 1910, President Theodore Roosevelt gave his famous New Nationalism speech in Osawatomie. The central issue he argued was government protection of human welfare and property rights.

On December 6, 2011, President Barack Obama gave an economic speech reprising many of Roosevelt&#x27;s themes at Osawatomie High School.

<text>Paola is a city in and the county seat of Miami County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 5,768.

==History==

Native Americans, then Spanish explorers such as Francisco Vásquez de Coronado in 1541, and French missionary explorers in 1673 lived and traveled throughout the area of what is now Paola. Despite these early European incursions at the start of the 19th century, the area was largely controlled by the Osage people.

Settlement of the area primarily occurred, however, when Kaskaskia, Peoria, Wea, and Piankeshaw tribes were forced to move to the area between 1827 and 1832. These formed the Confederated Allied Tribe, which was led by Baptiste Peoria, who was of both French and Indian ethnicity. They called their settlement Peoria Village.

By the 1840s, Euro-American settlers were moving into the area, and several missionaries lived in and near &quot;Peoria Village&quot;. One of those missionaries was an Italian priest who moved to the area in 1852. The priest, Father Paul D. Ponziglione, was credited with renaming Peoria Village to Paola, after a small town on the coast of Calabria, Italy. The Peoria Indians of the area continued to call it Paola, because they had great respect for Father Ponziglione.

By 1854 there was a large number of settlers who moved to the settlement, and a town plat was laid out by 1855. In 1855, the First Territorial Legislature passed an act that incorporated the Paola Town Company. The Paola Town Company and specifically its member Baptiste Peoria with his wife Mary Ann Isaacs are credited as being influential in the founding and development of Paola through the mid-1860s.

During the Civil War a military post was established on the west side of Bull Creek, just west of Paola. At times troops were inside Paola itself. Paola was barely spared an attack on August 21, 1863, by Confederate guerrilla William C. Quantrill during Quantrill&#x27;s retreat after raiding Lawrence. Paola was west of the retreat of Confederate Maj. Gen. Sterling Price&#x27;s force on October 24, 1864, while he was retreating toward Indian Territory. Paola&#x27;s post was deactivated in August or September 1865.

Following Kansas&#x27; admission to the Union in 1861, Civil War pressure to move the Native American tribes increased, and they were exiled to Oklahoma by 1868. Some individuals stayed and became citizens of the United States, however, their leader Baptiste Peoria left Paola with the tribe. From the late 1860s and through the 1870s, Paola grew and progressed, building its first school, jail, and bank.

The railroad came to serve Paola in 1870, which also aided its progress through this time. Following the discovery of natural gas in 1882, Paola became the first town west of the Mississippi River to use it commercially and have the town illuminated using natural gas lanterns. In 1898 the Miami County Courthouse was built, designed by architect George Washburn. Several homes and buildings were designed by Washburn, including the Paola Park Square gazebo and the Paola Free Library. Martha Smith had the Paola Library building constructed in honor of her husband John, a wine maker. It was completed in 1906 and the Paola Park Square&#x27;s Victorian-style gazebo is from 1913. The library, courthouse, gazebo, and several homes are among those still in use today.

In 1912, James Patterson moved to Paola to establish his winter quarters for his travelling circus, the Patterson Circus. The circus continued until 1927. A wall mural based on a 1924 circus pamphlet, is at 106 W. Peoria. The Patterson&#x27;s home still stands in Paola in the 600 block of north Mulberry, as the only remaining structure from the circus winter headquarters.

===Paola Park Square===
Paola&#x27;s town began with the Indian tribes who once lived in the area and used it as their primary gathering place. Prior to their exile to Oklahoma, Indian leader Baptiste Peoria gave this area to the Paola Town Company (of which he was a member) as a treaty of peace. The Paola Town Company later gave the square to the City of Paola, with the provision that no building be built on it. In 1867, the original gazebo was put on the square, and was a bandstand. In the 1800s the square was used as a track for racing horses in addition to serving as a central point for parades, celebrations, and other community events. In 1913, a new Victorian-style gazebo was built, designed by George Washburn. Paola Park Square is used for community events each year. The 1913 gazebo is still used, and near the gazebo is a bust of Paola founders Baptiste Peoria and his wife, Mary Ann Isaacs Dagenet. It is the only known monument in the United States featuring a Native American and his wife. A fountain in the center of the square was also added.

== History ==
On permanent organization of the county in 1870, Beloit was selected as the county seat of Mitchell County, Kansas, and is located northeast of the center of the county on the Solomon River. In 1873, an iron bridge was built across the river, costing $10,000, . The town site of Beloit was first settled by A.A. Bell in 1868 with the idea of improving the water power and for some time was known as Willow Springs. The town was renamed to Beloit by Tim Hersey, one of the original founders and the first mayor, and is named after his hometown, Beloit, Wisconsin. A.A. Bell was appointed postmaster in 1870, and the first school was built in 1871. By 1898, the population was around 2500. Beloit sits at the junction of the Union Pacific and the Missouri Pacific Railroads. Local legend has it that the local Indians advised Bell to locate the town at a certain bend of the Solomon river to protect the town from tornadoes. As of 2022, downtown Beloit has been hit with a tornado only once, in November 1922.

The town of Beloit was platted March 26, 1872, and the original description as found in the recorder&#x27;s office covers all of Section 9, and the south half of the southeast quarter and south half of the southwest quarter of Section 4, Town 7 and Range 7 west. The proprietors of the town were T.F. Hersey, A.A. Bell, George Campbell, Alexander Campbell, C.H. Morrill, Edward Valentine, W.C. Ingram, Daniel Kepler and Vinton Whitehurst. The town grew very rapidly, and in July 1872, was incorporated as a city of the third class. On March 10, 1879, Gov. John P. St. John proclaimed Beloit a city of the second class.

In 1887, the Missouri Pacific railroad was built through Caney, and in that same year, the town was incorporated. By 1905 the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway had also built through Caney. The two railroads served the city for much of the 19th century. Today only the former ATSF tracks remain, currently operated by the South Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad.

Caney has long been associated with the petroleum industry in Kansas. In 1906, a major gas well fire took place in this area. In 1909, Caney became the site of the original Kanotex Refining Company. Currently, CVR Energy&#x27;s pipeline system can transport up to 145,000 barrels/day of crude oil from Caney to that company&#x27;s refinery in Coffeyville, Kansas.

<text>Cherryvale is a city in Montgomery County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 2,192.

==History==

Cherryvale was founded on the land of the Osage Indians who were pushed out by veterans of the American Civil War looking for land. The first white man to purchase property and settle here was Mr. Abe Eaton, who later sold it to the Kansas City, Lawrence &amp; Southern Kansas Railroad which then became the Leavenworth, Lawrence &amp; Galveston Railway, and eventually came under the control of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, which operated the line for much of the 20th century. The town site was platted by the railroad in 1871. It was named Cherryvale from its position in the valley of Cherry Creek.

Between 1871 and 1873, at least eleven people vanished in the vicinity of an inn and general store operated by the Bender family about eight miles () northeast of Cherryvale. Following the disappearance of the Benders in 1873, it was discovered that they had apparently murdered a number of travellers. Between eight and eleven bodies were discovered buried on the premises. Governor Thomas A. Osborn offered a reward of $2,000 for the apprehension of the Benders, but they were never found.

The main part of the town was destroyed by fire in 1873, but was soon rebuilt, and in 1880 Cherryvale became a city of the third and afterwards of the second class. Natural gas, which is used as a factory fuel and for street and domestic lighting, was found here in 1889, and oil several years later.

The city is currently the headquarters for the South Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad, a shortline that runs 511 miles of track in Kansas and Oklahoma. The railroad, owned by WATCO, painted locomotive EMD SD40-2 number 4158, in the high school&#x27;s colors of blue and white in 2011, and the unit is stationed at the intermodal switchyard, completed 2013, north of Cherryvale.

<text>Coffeyville is a city in southeastern Montgomery County, Kansas, United States, located along the Verdigris River in the state&#x27;s southeastern region. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 8,826. Coffeyville is the most populous city of Montgomery County, and the home to Coffeyville Community College. The town of South Coffeyville, Oklahoma is approximately south of the city.

==History==

This settlement was founded in 1869 as an Indian trading post by Col. James A. Coffey, serving the population across the border in what was then the Indian Territory. The town was stimulated in 1871 by being made a stop on the Leavenworth, Lawrence &amp; Galveston Railroad, which connected it to other markets and developments. With the arrival of the railroad, a young surveyor, Napoleon B. Blanton, was dispatched to lay out the town. The naming of the town was left to the toss of a coin between Col. Coffey and U.S. Army Captain Blanton. Coffey won the toss and the town was officially named Coffeyville.

The city was incorporated in 1872, but the charter was voided as illegal, and the city was re-incorporated in March 1873.

As a frontier settlement, Coffeyville had its share of violence. On October 5, 1892, four of the Dalton Gang were killed in a shootout during an attempted bank robbery; Emmett Dalton survived with 23 gunshot wounds and later pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, although he later asserted that he never fired a shot during the robbery. He served 14 years before being pardoned. The gang had been trying to rob the First National and Condon banks, located across the street from each other. Law enforcement personnel and civilians recognized them under their disguises of fake beards and attacked the gang members as they fled one of the banks. Three civilians and a local marshal, Charles T. Connelly, died defending the town. The town holds an annual celebration each October to commemorate the Dalton Raid.

After the discovery of its resources of plentiful natural gas and abundant clay, Coffeyville enjoyed rapid growth from 1890 to 1910, as its population expanded sixfold. Many of the Coffeyville buildings now appearing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) were built during this time period. They include the Old Condon National Bank (now the Perkins Building, c. 1890, added 1/12/1973), the Brown Mansion (c. 1904–1907, added 12/12/1976), the new larger Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church (c. 1907, added 7/28/1995), the Midland Theater (c. 1928, added 2/9/2005), and the Charles M. Ball House (c. 1906–1908, added 2/7/2011).

From the turn of the 20th century to the 1930s, Coffeyville was one of the largest glass and brick manufacturing centers in the nation. During this same period, the development of oil production attracted the founding of several oil field equipment manufacturers, and more workers and residents.

In March 1927, a racially charged riot occurred after three African American men were arrested on a false accusation of raping two teenage girls. A white mob stormed the jail, but were unable to locate the three men. The mob then attacked African Americans on the streets. Kansas National Guardsmen arrived and restored order.

===Early Sunday School===
In 1930 residents who were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) organized a Sunday School; it was one of only 11 places in Kansas to have such a facility then.

===Coffeyville Multiscope===
Coffeyville industrialist Douglas Brown founded Coffeyville Multiscope, which produced components of the Norden bombsight. This played a determining role in the perfection of precision daylight bombing during World War II as a result of the bombsight&#x27;s advanced accuracy and drift correction capability.

===2007 flood===
On July 1, 2007, Coffeyville suffered a major flood when the Verdigris River crested at 10 feet above flood stage and flooded approximately a third of the city. The flood topped the local refinery (Coffeyville Resources LLC) levees by 4 feet, allowing oil to pollute the water. Approximately 1700 barrels (71,000 gallons) of crude oil mingled with the already contaminated flood waters. The EPA worked to prevent the oil and flood water mix from continuing downriver, where it could damage the water in Oologah Lake near Oologah, Oklahoma. Many residential water supplies are drawn from that lake. A minimal amount of oil reached Oologah Lake, and it did not pose a threat to the water supplies of other cities along the Verdigris River or from the lake. A number of animals were found dead or injured in flood areas, covered with oil.

By July 2, areas east of Patterson Street were off limits, and a curfew was enacted in other areas of the city. On July 3, the city lost its supply of potable water, but the water service was restored and the order to boil water rescinded on July 7. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Red Cross came to aid residents, and Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius and President George W. Bush declared the city a federal disaster area. Most displaced residents found shelter with family and friends, but many were sheltered in two area churches and a senior citizens&#x27; apartment complex. Some pets were rescued to a temporary animal shelter built for them at LeClere Park.

The flooded area on the city&#x27;s east side was reopened on July 11 for residents and business owners to begin assessing damage and to retrieve salvageable items.
 In order to focus on the post-flood recovery and clean-up, the city and state cancelled the 2007 Inter-State Fair &amp; Rodeo. The ongoing flood recovery included a wholesale environmental remediation of the flood-affected eastern portion of the city, which continued through late 2008 to early 2009. Many of the flood-damaged homes were purchased by Coffeyville Resources LLC as a part of its effort to compensate the homeowners affected by the oil spill.

Independence was settled on land that was purchased from the Osage Indians in September 1869 by George A. Brown for the price of $50. The Osage were forced to move to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) to make way for white settlement. Brown originally called the townsite Colfax after Schuyler Colfax, vice president under President Ulysses S. Grant. On August 21, 1869 a group of Oswego, Kansas men led by R. W. Wright settled there with the intent to make Independence the county seat. E. E. Wilson and F D. Irwin opened the first store in October 1869, naming it Wilson &amp; Irwin Groceries. Independence was designated county seat in 1870.

<text>Council Grove is a city in and the county seat of Morris County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 2,140. It was named after an agreement between American settlers and the Osage Nation allowing settlers&#x27; wagon trains to pass westward through the area on the Santa Fe Trail. Pioneers gathered at a grove of trees so that wagons could band together for their trip west.

== History ==


Council Grove was a stop on the Santa Fe Trail. The first European-American settler was Seth M. Hays, who came to the area in 1847 to trade with the Kaw tribe, which had a reservation established in the area in 1846. Hays was a great-grandson of Daniel Boone.

The Main street in Council Grove is the old Santa Fe Trail. The Rawlinson-Terwilliger Home, 803 West Main Street, is the oldest stone home on the Santa Fe Trail and houses the Trail Days Cafe &amp; Museum.

A post office was established in Council Grove on February 26, 1855.

In 1858, the town was officially incorporated by the legislature. Hays also opened a restaurant in 1857, the Hays House, which is said to be the oldest continuously operating restaurant west of the Mississippi River.

The town has 15 sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places. One is the Post Office Oak. Travelers left their mail in this designated tree to be picked up by others going in the right direction. General Custer of the United States Army slept here with his troops during the American Civil War, under a large tree known now as the Custer Elm. 
The National Old Trails Road, also known as the Ocean-to-Ocean Highway, was established in 1912, and was routed through Herington, Delavan, Council Grove.

In 1943, German and Italian prisoners of World War II were brought to Kansas and other Midwest states as a means of solving the labor shortage caused by American men serving in the war effort. Large internment camps were established in Kansas: Camp Concordia, Camp Funston (at Fort Riley), Camp Phillips (at Salina under Fort Riley). Fort Riley established 12 smaller branch camps, including Council Grove.

<text>Dunlap is a city in Morris County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 27.

==History==
On March 19, 1874, a post office was established in Hillsborough, Kansas. It was later reestablished on April 20 of the same year as Dunlap, Kansas. This was named after an Indian agent representing the Kanza tribe named Joseph Gage Dunlap who had founded the town in 1869 once the Kanza tribe had migrated to Oklahoma. The town grew slowly after its founding, taking it five years to be eligible for a post office.

The town really started to take off when Benjamin &quot;Pap&quot; Singleton came to town in the spring of 1878. He was born a slave in 1809 in Nashville, Tennessee. At 37, in 1846, he escaped to freedom and made his way to Detroit and started an underground boarding house for other escaped slaves. Following the emancipation, he returned to Nashville.

Following the Civil War, newly freed slaves in the South enjoyed their time as free citizens. However, when military troops were removed their rights were no longer secure. This brought up the Ku Klux Klan and then continued to wreak havoc on African Americans. The Klan then continued to terrorize and killed African Americans if they did not bend to their will, and a new system of sharecropping and Jim Crow laws virtually re-enslaved African Americans. Singleton, having returned to the South, realized something needed to be done. Having knowledge that Kansas was famous for John Brown&#x27;s efforts and its struggle against slavery he chose it as the place he would lead his people, treating it as a type of “promised land”. Singleton continued to support this effort by traveling across the South organizing groups of people to colonize in Kansas. His mission to free slaves never stopped and during the 1870s, he led a group of African Americans to Kansas. Here he formed Singleton&#x27;s Colony which consisted of 200 black families and was situated on 7,500 acres of land. Singleton, however, encouraged only independent blacks to move to Kansas and was against the highly educated “political” ones as he wanted men that worked. Singleton moved to Dunlap in 1878. He then decided this is where we would lead more freed slaves escaping the South. He distributed posters and flyers boasting; “Sunny Kansas”, “one of the finest countries for a poor man in the world”, “plenty of stone and water, and wood on the streams”, and “large tracts of land, peaceful homes, and firesides, undisturbed by anyone”. Between 1877 and 1879, hundreds followed him to Kansas, some settling in Wyandotte, others in “Singleton’s Colony”, near Topeka, and finally in Dunlap. Dunlap was Singleton&#x27;s biggest success giving himself the name “Father of the Exodus”. After this initial movement, the second wave of almost 20,000 African Americans migrated to Kansas. These people are known as Exodusters. They arrived daily in waves of hundreds of people between 1879 and 1880. Unlike the first group led by Singleton, the Exodusters came with no resources. The towns and communities they migrated too already struggled with supporting a large population, so this large influx of people did not help. These communities went to the state government for help in this, which resulted in the Kansas Freedmen&#x27;s Relief Association in 1879. Established by Governor John St. John, the KFRA distributed resources for struggling African American families. This gave those with little resources the ability to improve their quality of life and be a vital part of their communities. Benjamin “Pap” Singleton died peacefully in 1900, in Kansas City, Missouri. Towards the end of his life, he was comforted by the fact that he led thousands to a better life in Kansas providing people of the future a better place to live.

After Singleton&#x27;s death, the community continued to grow through the beginning of the 20th century. In 1880, the Presbyterian church&#x27;s Rev. John M. Snodgrass was a missionary to the freedmen, and he founded the Freedmen&#x27;s Academy. This was founded so that African Americans could have a proper education. The church is now collapsed and has been in disrepair since the 1930s. Because of the large influx of African Americans, the original settlers and townspeople of Dunlap were not originally happy that Singleton chose Dunlap as a relocation spot for freed slaves. In the late 1800s and early 20th century, the newly freed slaves faced some prejudice. However, it was nothing compared to the hate and terror they were put through in the South. While they were segregated in schools and businesses, African Americans were able to own and run their own. That is also why they had to find their own school. For certain parts of Dunlap&#x27;s history, they were also confined to their own cemetery, Dunlap Colored Cemetery chartered in 1894.

Now after its founding, and after Singleton brought large numbers of Exodusters to Dunlap and its surrounding areas. At the turn of the century, Dunlap was home to hundreds of citizens and served as a major shipping port for the surrounding counties, Morris, Lyon, and Chase. Being located on the Neosho River the fields were fertile and it helped Dunlap grow even further. During its heyday, Dunlap was home to a blacksmith, the Guarantee State Bank, Baptist, Congregational and Methodist churches an ice cream lounge, a dairy factory producing cheese and butter, a hotel, and a flour mill. However, with racism still being present some store owners wouldn&#x27;t let African Americans into their businesses and were forced to run their own. This segregation eventually fell away as Dunlap integrated stores and schools far before the rest of the country. With Dunlap being a virtual “promised land” for African Americans escaping racism in the South and while Dunlap had thrived in the early 20th century it fell victim to the Great Depression.

In the 1930s the Dust Bowl also occurred. The Dust Bowl was caused by poor farming techniques and resulted in dust storms across the country. This resulted in difficulties in growing crops. All these factors lead to the abandonment of small farming communities across the country, resulting in the ghost town. The last celebration of Juneteenth, a celebration of the day slaves heard they were emancipated, was in 1931. Eventually, the bank filed for bankruptcy and businesses closed. This was then followed by the school and then the church closing its doors, even the old Methodist church which was donated to the Kansas Historical Society. And just as fast as the population grew, it fell. Hundreds left to find a better life, many going to Kansas City, Council Grove, and other larger communities. Eventually, the economy came back and was stronger than it ever had been. However, the old Dunlap never returned and if it is known, it is only known as one of the many ghost towns of Kansas.

The post office finally closed its doors in 1988 marking the end of Dunlap. Dunlap is now an unincorporated territory of Kansas and is only home to roughly thirty people. Its last Black resident was buried in the colored cemetery on April 27, 1993, to be with family.

===Dunlap Colored Cemetery===
Dunlap Colored Cemetery, also known as the Exoduster Cemetery, was nominated to the National Register of Historic Places by Janet Kimbrell and the Morris County Historical Society. Dunlap&#x27;s Colored Cemetery was built in response to segregation and the prejudice against the Exoduster community. The cemetery was first established in 1880 and is now occupied with over a hundred African American graves. Dunlap&#x27;s Colored Cemetery was added to the register on September 14, 2018. The Cemetery was officially added for its association with the Exoduster&#x27;s Movement and to “Pap” Singleton the Father of the Exodus.

Elkhart was founded in 1913, and was named after Elkhart, Indiana.

Elkhart was the starting point of the Elkhart and Santa Fe Railway. This line, both leased to and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, was built in 1925 to Felt, Oklahoma, and extended into New Mexico in 1932; but, was abandoned in 1942.

In 1961, the county seat was moved from Richfield to Elkhart.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Elkhart has a cool semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;) characterized by generally dry winters with extreme temperature variations, and hot summers with occasional heavy precipitation from thunder showers or storms.

During winter, because western Kansas lies both on the edge of the subtropical anticyclones and in the rain shadow of westerly winds crossing the Rocky Mountains, the region is generally dry: no measurable precipitation fell in Elkhart between 25 December 1903 and 2 April 1904, while monthly precipitation above has never been recorded during January and is observed fewer than one year in ten during November, December or February. Temperatures can vary greatly during this season: strong chinook winds can drive temperatures above even in the depth of winter, with reached on average during six days between December and February, seven during November and eight during March. Nevertheless, cold outbreaks from Canada drive temperatures to or below on an average of 3.6 nights per winter. The coldest temperature recorded in Elkhart has been on January 19, 1984, while the hottest winter temperature has been on February 1, 1963.

Snowfall is generally light due to dryness; however in the extremely wet and cold February 1903, fell, being the major factor behind a record seasonal snowfall of between July 1902 and June 1903. In contrast, only a trace of snow was recorded between July 1949 and January 1950.

In the summer, the climate is generally very hot with relief from thunderstorms that provide most of the of precipitation expected during one year. When an upper level anticyclone moves poleward, the atmosphere can become very stable and produce sustained extreme heat: in the hottest month of July 1980 the average maximum was and all but seven days topped . When the high retreats southward or a trough forms over the interior of the United States during the summer, however, precipitation can be heavy, with falling in April 2016, in June 2004 and in July 1927. The wettest calendar year has been 1941 with and the driest 1937 when only fell.
