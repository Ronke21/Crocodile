<doc id="112348" wikidata="Q913209" url="?curid=112348" title="Kokomo, Indiana">
<text>Kokomo ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Howard County, Indiana, United States. Its population was 59,890 according to the U.S. Census Bureau 2023 estimate. It is the principal city of the Kokomo metropolitan area, which includes all of Howard County, and it is the largest city and regional center for the North Central Indiana region consisting of ~225,000 people across six counties anchored by the city of Kokomo. The city is located approximately north of Indianapolis and south of South Bend, Indiana. 

Named for the Miami Ma-Ko-Ko-Mo who was called &quot;Chief Kokomo&quot;, Kokomo first benefited from the legal business associated with being the county seat. Before the Civil War, it was connected with Indianapolis and then the Eastern cities by railroad, which resulted in sustained growth. Substantial growth came after the discovery of large natural gas reserves, which produced an economic boom in the mid-1880s. Among the businesses which the boom attracted was the fledgling automobile industry. A significant number of technical and engineering innovations were developed in Kokomo, particularly in automobile production, and, as a result, Kokomo became known as the &quot;City of Firsts.&quot; A substantial portion of Kokomo&#x27;s employment still depends on the automobile industry.

==History==

===Early history and incorporation===
The city of Kokomo was named after the Miami man Ma-Ko-Ko-Mo, said to have been one of the four sons of Chief Richardville, last of the chiefs of the Miami people. Tradition holds that David Foster, the &quot;Father of Kokomo,&quot; named the town Kokomo after the &quot;ornriest Indian on earth&quot; because Kokomo was &quot;the ornriest town on earth.&quot; Kokomo is thought to have been born in 1775 and died in 1838. The only documentary proof of his existence is a trading post record of a purchase of a barrel of flour for $12 for his &quot;squaw.&quot; His remains (with those of others) were reportedly discovered during the construction of a saw mill in 1848 and re-interred in the &quot;north-east corner&quot; of the Pioneer Cemetery. The tradition of the Peru Miami is that the town was named after a Thorntown Miami named Ko-kah-mah, whose name is rendered Co-come-wah in the Treaty at the Forks of the Wabash in 1834. That name was translated as &quot;the diver&quot; (an animal that could swim under water).
As a result of various removals, by 1840 the Miami population in Howard County (until 1846 known as Richardville County) was reduced to about 200. The principal settlement was the Village of Kokomo, on the south side of Wildcat Creek. Indian paths connected Kokomo with Frankfort and Thorntown (along the Wildcat) and led to Peru by way of Cassville, and to Meshingomesia by way of Greentown. At the time David Foster had a trading post in Howard County, near the intersection of the reservation boundary line and Wildcat pike, where he engaged in both legitimate trade and illegal sale of alcohol to the Miamis on government property.

Shortly after Richardville County was organized in 1844 the commissioners appointed to establish the county seat approached Foster for a donation from his substantial holdings. (In 1846 tax records show that he owned of farmland and as well as 67 divided lots in the business district.) At the time of the request the only improvements in what is now Kokomo were Foster&#x27;s log house and log barn and several Miami huts. The commissioners sought a donation of the more fertile lands south of Wildcat Creek, but Foster refused, donating instead north of the creek—land which was thickly forested and &quot;swampy.&quot; The terms of the donation required that Foster build a courthouse on the land, but he was later excused and Rufus L. Blowers was promised $28 to build it. He was penalized $2 for construction delays. The log courthouse was completed in 1845.

In June 1855, Henry A. Brouse petitioned the board of Howard county commissioners to incorporate the town of Kokomo. The original election was not held (for unspecified reasons), but another took place on October 1, 1855. After a vote of 62–3 in favor of incorporation, the board so ordered it.

On March 31, 1865, an election was held for Kokomo to assume a city government. The resolution was passed, and Nelson Purdum was elected the first mayor.

===Early growth===
In anticipation of business that the court would bring, Kokomo began a fairly quick growth from the time that lots were first sold on October 18, 1844. David Foster was granted the first license to sell merchandise in Kokomo at the December 1844 commissioners meeting. Two more merchants were licensed in March 1845. John Bohan, who would become a major shop owner, merchant, justice of the peace and investor, moved to Kokomo in December 1844, and erected the first two-story frame house, not only in Kokomo, but in all the county.

After the enactment of the 1846 pre-emption law, settlers rapidly attempted to secure homesteads in the surrounding lands.

In 1848 Stonebreaker&#x27;s Mill, west of Kokomo, began operations. By 1850 Kokomo had a newspaper, when James Beard purchased the printing equipment of the New London &quot;Pioneer&quot; and set up the Howard &quot;Tribune&quot;. By 1851 county business was so brisk that the county ordered the construction of two more court buildings, both one story brick affairs, . The county auditor and treasurer occupied one building, and the clerk and recorder occupied the other.

On April 1, 1854, Kokomo&#x27;s first bank, the Indian Reserve Bank, was organized with David Foster, John Bohan and Harless Ashly the principal shareholders. (It only lasted a few years until a robbery impaired its capital. The loss substantially injured Foster&#x27;s fortune.)

===Railroads===
1854 saw the first railroad stop at Kokomo. The New London &quot;Pioneer&quot; had long advocated for a rail line to connect Kokomo with Indianapolis. Colonel C.D. Murray was the agent at Kokomo for stock subscriptions in support of the railroad. In 1852 the construction of the Peru and Indianapolis Railroad commenced. In Kokomo Samuel C. Mills and Dr. Corydon Richmond, commercial competitors of David Foster, donated several lots to the railroad in order to secure the location of the rail depot near their commercial property. The route was laid along Buckeye Street at the insistence of the merchants who hoped to reduced drayage expenses. Samuel Mills built a large frame structure at the Howard flouring mills, which served as a warehouse for the company&#x27;s freight and a passenger depot. For some time after 1854 Kokomo was the terminus of the line, but eventually the line was extended to Peru and then to Michigan City.

A short time after the construction of the Peru and Indianapolis Railroad began, the Pennsylvania Railroad announced that one of its lines would pass through Kokomo. By 1853 a line was commenced between Kokomo and Logansport (which was intended to become the hub of a network of lines for the company). Railroad service was inaugurated on that line on July 4, 1855.

The most important rail line for Kokomo became the standard-gauge Clover Leaf line. This railroad would eventually link Kokomo with both the West Coast and the Eastern Seaboard. It began as a short line linking Frankfort and Kokomo, the Frankfort and Kokomo Railroad. Henry Y. Morrison of Frankfort was the principal promoter, and A.Y. Comstock acted for him in Kokomo. A failure of the proposed subsidy caused the promoters to turn all assets over to the contractors, who promised to complete the line. Construction began in 1873 and was completed the following year. Limited freight between the two cities made the line unprofitable. After a series of acquisitions by other railroads, the line became part of the Toledo, St. Louis and Kansas City Railroad. A line connecting it to the east reached Kokomo on January 1, 1881.

===Mayor Cole===
In 1881, one of the most remarkable and controversial events in Kokomo&#x27;s history took place. Mayor Henry C. Cole was shot to death by a sheriff&#x27;s posse. Dr. Cole had a curious history and had stirred up a great deal of passion in the previous fifteen years. He was reputed to have been a gifted surgeon, who served in the Union Army during the Civil War and when afterwards he settled in Kokomo, he became a prominent physician. In Kokomo he married a woman, Natalie Cole, of whom he became intensely jealous. He became suspicious of one Allen, whom he warned away from Kokomo. When he discovered Allen leaving the post office one day in October 1866, he shot him dead. The fact that the killing both took place in broad daylight and showed cold-blooded rage (Cole continued shooting after Allen was down) caused the crime to receive national attention. Cole&#x27;s case was venued to Tipton County, where he retained Daniel W. Voorhees of Terre Haute to represent him. Voorhees obtained a not guilty verdict on a plea of emotional insanity. Cole divorced his wife thereafter.

Cole&#x27;s reputation for violent instability, and the cowardice in the way he killed Allen, created many enemies for him, but his generosity toward poor patients and a promise to &quot;clean up&quot; the town won him enough support to win a bitter election for Mayor in 1881. Shortly thereafter, on September 19, 1881, he was shot dead by a sheriff&#x27;s posse at Old Spring Mills at West Jefferson Street. According to the coroner&#x27;s inquest, he died from shotgun wounds inflicted by Deputy George Bennett (father of New York stage idol Richard Bennett). The sheriff claimed that an informant had advised him that Cole was planning to rob a flour mill, possibly to incriminate his enemies. The posse was forced to fire on Cole in self-defense (the sheriff claimed he had two revolvers) and to prevent his escape, although his injuries seemed inconsistent with that version. Cole&#x27;s supporter&#x27;s argued that no revolvers or burglary tools were produced and that the motive was implausible. Nevertheless, no action was taken against Bennett or the other members of the posse.

===Natural gas boom===
Natural gas had been developed in Pennsylvania and Canada for some time, and had most recently been developed around Findlay, Ohio. In March 1886, a group of citizens, led principally by A.Y. Comstock (who had promoted the Frankfort and Kokomo Railroad) and D.C. Spraker (later President of Kokomo Rubber Company), circulated a memorandum seeking subscribers (at $100 each) for the purpose of boring for gas at a distance of at least below ground. It took until September to obtain the necessary 22 subscribers. The first rig was built south of Wildcat Creek. and on October 6, 1886, natural gas erupted forth and the well was capped.

Together with the well in Eaton, which began producing slightly before Kokomo&#x27;s, the discovery led to the Indiana Gas Boom. This discovery was directly responsible for Elwood Haynes&#x27; move to Kokomo, as a superintendent with a gas company with interests in Kokomo and Howard County. The Diamond Plate Glass Company (now part of PPG Industries) began in Kokomo in 1887, lured by the cheap and plentiful natural gas. The Kokomo Opalescent Glass Works started making stained glass in Kokomo in 1888 and has been in continuous operation ever since.

===&quot;City of Firsts&quot;===
As a result of the natural gas boom, Kokomo attracted an increasing number of industries, which resulted in significant technological innovations. For these industrial and technical achievements, Kokomo is officially known as the &quot;City of Firsts.&quot; Among other achievements, Kokomo was a pioneer of the United States automobile manufacturing, with Elwood Haynes test-driving his early internal combustion engine auto there on July 4, 1894. Haynes and his associates built a number of other autos over the next few years; the Haynes-Apperson Automobile Company for mass-production of commercial autos was established in Kokomo in 1898. Haynes went on to invent Stainless Steel flatware in 1912 to give his wife tarnish-free dinnerware. In 1938, the Delco Radio Division of General Motors (now Aptiv) developed the first push button car radio.

Kokomo serves as the &quot;City of Firsts&quot; in the food industry as well. In 1928 Walter Kemp, Kemp Brothers Canning Co. developed the first canned tomato juice because of a request by a physician in search for baby food for his clinic. Kokomo is also home to the first mechanical corn picker which was developed by John Powell in the early 1920s. Kokomo was home to the first Ponderosa Steakhouse, which opened in 1965. Kokomo opened the first McDonald&#x27;s with a diner inside, locally called &quot;McDiner.&quot; This McDonald&#x27;s theme failed nationally. Eventually, the &quot;McDiner&quot; closed and was converted back to a regular McDonald&#x27;s restaurant.
The following inventions are associated with Kokomo:
* 1894 – Elwood Haynes makes the first successful trial run of his &quot;horseless carriage&quot; on Pumpkinvine Pike, which is now Boulevard east of Indiana 931 (formerly U.S.31.)
* 1894 – The first pneumatic rubber tire in the US was created by D.C. Spraker at the Kokomo Rubber Tire Company.
* 1895 – The first aluminum casting was developed by William &quot;Billy&quot; Johnson from the Ford and Donnelly Foundry.
* 1902 – Kingston carburetor developed by George Kingston.
* 1906 – The first Stellite cobalt-base alloy was discovered by Elwood Haynes.
* 1912 – Stainless steel tableware was invented by Elwood Haynes as a response to his wife&#x27;s desire for tableware that wouldn&#x27;t tarnish.
* 1918 – The Howitzer shell, used in World War I, was created by the Superior Machine Tool Company.
* 1918 – The first aerial bomb with fins was produced by the Liberty Pressed Metal Company.
* 1920 – The mechanical corn picker was created by John Powell.
* 1923 – William Swern Sr. developed the first tire-building machine for mass production of auto tires 
* 1928 – The first canned tomato juice was created by Walter Kemp from Kemp Brothers Canning Company in response to a physician&#x27;s need for baby food.
* 1938 – The first push-button car radio was created at Delco Radio Division of General Motors Corporation.
* 1941 – Globe American Stove Company manufactured the first all-metal life boats and rafts, known as Kokomo Kids in the US Navy.
* 1947 – The first signal-seeking car radio was created by the Delco Radio Division of General Motors.
* 1956 – Delco Radio Division of General Motors produced a transistorized signal-seeking car (hybrid) radio, which used both vacuum tubes and transistors in its radio&#x27;s circuitry. This transistorized car radio was available as an option on the 1956 Chevrolet Corvette car models.
* 1957 – Delco Radio Division of General Motors produced an all-transistor car radio, as standard equipment for the Cadillac Eldorado Brougham car model.

===1913 Flood===
On March 21–26, 1913 Kokomo suffered severe flooding when of rainfall occurred. The &quot;Kokomo Tribune&quot; reported at the time that the Wildcat Creek over-topped its levee to reach nearly wide after rising at a rate of per hour. Damage was widespread, including loss of electrical power due to the power plant being flooded. On March 26, flooding was declared over after the water level dropped in a 24-hour period.

=== Continental Steel Corporation ===
From 1914 through 1986, the Continental Steel Corporation facility produced nails, wire and wire fence from scrap steel on a facility in Kokomo. Manufacturing operations in the steel plant and on other portions of the property included the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials. Steel-making operations had included reheating, casting rolling, drawing, pickling, galvanizing, tinning and tempering.

After the company filed for bankruptcy in 1986, EPA and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management investigated the plant and property and found soil, sediments, surface water and ground water contaminated with volatile organic compounds (PCBs) and several metals, including lead, arsenic, cadmium, and chromium. Lead contamination was also detected in soils on nearby residential properties.

The site was proposed to the National Priorities List as a Superfund site in 1988 and formally added in 1989.

In April 2009, EPA received almost $6 million in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to complete needed cleanup at two problems at the Continental Steel Superfund site: the former Slag Processing Area and the site&#x27;s contaminated ground water. The ARRA funding helped accelerate the cleanup of hazardous waste on the site. In the process, total of 15 Indiana contractors or subcontractors were involved in the ARRA-funded work, creating at least 45 temporary jobs.

In August 2010, using the ARRA funds, EPA completed the cleanup of the former slag processing area of the Superfund Site. Approximately of slag were moved to the site&#x27;s acid lagoon area for use as fill on that portion of the site. of clean soil were used to cap the former slag processing area, leaving it suitable for potential redevelopment. ARRA funds were also used to address contaminated groundwater at the site. This work included extensive groundwater sampling to determine the contaminated plume area and installation of groundwater extraction and monitoring wells. Three wind turbines will be used to generate much of the power needed to operate the groundwater extraction system.

Site cleanup was completed in August 2011.

In 2016 the former site was approved as the location of a Solar farm with installation of panels beginning in August 2016. The estimated cost of the project is $10M.
The solar energy park began operating on December 29, 2016.

===Ku Klux Klan===
In the summer of 1923, record numbers attended rallies of the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana. On June 16, 1923, a crowd of 75,000 attended a Klan rally in Terre Haute. On June 21 Argos held the largest rally it had ever seen. On June 26 a large Klan rally was held in Alexandria. All of this was merely a prelude to the rally planned for Kokomo. Conceived as a &quot;monster tristate conclave,&quot; it was intended to charter 93 Indiana klans representing more than 300,000 members. Some doubted the prospect of 200,000 attendees, claiming it would be &quot;without parallel in history&quot;; others predicted attendance of 300,000. Extensive preparations for that number were made, including the scheduling of 1,000 interurban cars from around Indiana to Kokomo. The Union Traction Company, in addition to supplying 50 cars, transported three cars of white horses to Kokomo for the parade. The Kokomo Klan rented the fields surrounding its own large lot for parking, and electric amplifiers were obtained to allow the large crowd to hear the speeches.

According to historian Robert Coughlan, &quot;literally half&quot; of Kokomo residents were members of the Ku Klux Klan during its height in the 1920s and 1930s. On July 4, 1923, Kokomo achieved national notoriety when it hosted the largest Ku Klux Klan gathering in history. An estimated 200,000 Klan members and supporters gathered in Malfalfa Park for a massive Konklave in which D. C. Stephenson was elevated to the position of Grand Dragon of the Indiana Klan. Other estimates say the crowd was only 10,000. A huge flag was used that day to collect a reported $50,000 for construction of a local &quot;Klan hospital&quot; so that Klan members would not have to be treated at the only local hospital, which was Catholic. Both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Klans held weekly rallies and initiations in Malfalfa Park, and Kokomo&#x27;s Klanswomen held meetings at the armory, the local headquarters of the Women of the Ku Klux Klan, and churches. A speech at a Baptist church was attended by 1,000 Klanswomen.

The Kokomo rally sent shockwaves through the national GOP, which had come to believe that the re-election of President Warren G. Harding depended on the vote of Indiana. According to the Washington correspondent of the &quot;New York World&quot;, Republicans feared that the Klan had &quot;obliterated party lines&quot; and &quot;virtually swallowed&quot; the Indiana Republican Party. Since the Republicans held only a 25,000 vote plurality in the state, any serious defection of African-Americans would tip the state to the Democrats. In the event, Harding died within a month and Republican Calvin Coolidge succeeded him with a substantial electoral majority (including Indiana) against a divided opposition. The Klan, however, continued to dominate state politics especially after the election of Edward L. Jackson as governor.

===Ryan White===

Kokomo served to symbolize the nation&#x27;s early misunderstanding and ignorance of AIDS in the mid-to-late 1980s when Ryan White was expelled from school due to his illness. White was a teenage hemophiliac who had been infected with HIV through contaminated blood products (Factor 8). At the time blood products were often collected through state prison systems. Factor 8 was made from pooled plasma of thousands of donors. Later the plasma was screened for HIV and Hepatitis and heat treated to inactivate HIV and Hepatitis. The teen had been attending Western Middle School (which is actually in Russiaville) but was ostracized by his classmates, and forced to eat lunch alone and use a separate restroom. Many parents and teachers in Kokomo rallied in support of banning White from attending the school. A lengthy administrative appeal process with the school system ensued, followed by death threats and violence against White and his family, including a bullet being fired through the window of their Kokomo home. Media coverage of the case made White into a national celebrity and spokesman for AIDS research and public education. In 1987, the White family left Kokomo for Cicero, Indiana. Ryan attended Hamilton Heights High School in nearby Arcadia, where he was welcomed by faculty and students.

===Gas tower===
The Kokomo Gas Tower had been a symbol of Kokomo since it was constructed in 1954. The tower was tall and had a capacity of . Due to high maintenance costs of $75,000 a year, and up to $1,000,000 to paint it, the gas company decided to demolish it in 2003. Other ideas were reviewed before settling on this decision, including a plan to turn the tower into a giant Coca-Cola advertisement. On September 7, 2003, at approximately 7:30 a.m., the Gas Tower was demolished by Controlled Demolition, Inc. (CDI). Pieces of the tower were sold to the public for $20–$30, and proceeds went to a planned Kokomo technology incubation center and Bona Vista.

==Geography==

===1965 tornado===
On April 11, 1965, the southern part of Kokomo was struck by one of the 47 tornadoes that erupted over six Midwestern states, an event now known as the Palm Sunday outbreak. The F4 tornado that swept through Kokomo was wide and killed 25 people in the surrounding area. Significant damage was done to the Chrysler transmission plant. Windows were broken and the framework cracked throughout, and sections of the west wall were leveled. The Maple Crest elementary and junior high schools suffered extensive damage. The roof collapsed on the junior high school, and the framework of both schools was substantially wrecked. The Maple Crest Shell Station at the intersection of Lincoln and Washington was torn from its foundation and scattered about. Mills Drug Store at the same intersection was demolished. A house on Holly Lane was uprooted, and one on James Drive was demolished. The Maple Crest Shopping Center was extensively damaged, with Woolworth&#x27;s suffering the most damage. The front and back of the one-story structure were caved in and merchandise was strewn about. Numerous homes in the Maple Crest area were flattened, and the top floor of the Maple Crest apartments was blown off. The only thing left standing on the nearby Church of the Brethren was the steeple. The force of the wind on the flat earth near Kokomo was so great that Ted Fujita was able to make aerial photographs of the spiral scouring on the ground.

===2016 tornado===
On August 24, 2016, a strong EF3 tornado damaged 1,000 homes on the city&#x27;s south side, with 170 sustaining major damage. 80 of these homes were destroyed, with some sustaining loss of roofs and exterior walls. Many large trees and power poles were snapped along the tornado&#x27;s path, and an apartment complex was heavily damaged as well. Vehicles also sustained damage, including a large truck that was moved 10 feet from the driveway of a house and flipped over. A Starbucks was completely destroyed, and several people were left trapped inside the still standing bathroom and had to be rescued. Many sheds and detached garages were also destroyed in the storm. A receipt from Kokomo was found 30 miles away in Marion. The storm followed a path very close to that of another tornado which hit on November 17, 2013. Meteorologists have noted that nearly every tornado in Kokomo has struck the southern part of the city.

=== Other notable tornadoes ===
Kokomo has been struck by 18 tornadoes between 1950 and 2015, some of which were strong enough to claim lives.

On March 6, 1961, two F3 tornadoes struck the southern part of Kokomo, killing one person and injuring three others.

On April 11, 1965, an F4 tornado tore through portions of Russiaville, Alto, southern Kokomo, and Greentown killing 25 people and injuring hundreds more.

On April 20, 2004, two tornadoes struck the northern part of Kokomo. The first tornado was rated F0 and caused little damage to homes and trees. The second tornado was rated F1 and caused a roof to collapse at the skating rink, and damaged three other homes and a truck stop. Both tornadoes caused 1 injury but no fatalities. This was the first time a tornado struck the northern part of Kokomo.

On November 17, 2013, two EF2 tornadoes tore through the southern part of Kokomo. The first tornado damaged over 300 homes and businesses. The second tornado touched down briefly and caused damage to the golf course and other businesses. The two tornadoes caused no fatalities and only five injuries.

On August 24, 2016, an EF3 tornado caused significant damage to the southern part of Kokomo, damaging over 1,000 homes and businesses. 80 of these homes were destroyed, 176 had walls blown in and roofs torn off, and over 700 were damaged badly. No fatal injuries were recorded during this tornado.

==Economy==

Kokomo&#x27;s employment, largely based in manufacturing, was hard hit by the economic downturn which led to the recession beginning in December 2007. In December 2008, Kokomo was ranked third by &quot;Forbes&quot; in its list of America&#x27;s fastest dying towns, mainly as a result of the financial difficulties of the automotive industry.

In May 2011, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine listed Kokomo as one of the &quot;Best Cities for Jobs&quot; after the city ascended 177 places in the rankings. The same article described Kokomo&#x27;s success in the past few years as &quot;inspirational&quot; and attributed the turnaround to &quot;a revival in manufacturing.&quot; In June 2011, &quot;Conexus&quot; released a report touting Kokomo&#x27;s &quot;rapid bounce&quot; after the recession, and predicted a rise in income of more than 2%, assuming increased automobile production.

By May 2013 Kokomo&#x27;s unemployment rate was 9%, representing a 1.4% decrease in non-farm employment, it was higher than the national rate of 7.6%. The May 2013 statistics reported a 6.9% decline in manufacturing jobs over the previous 12 months. Government employment was 18.7% below the previous year.

===Transportation===
====Airports====

====Highways====
* US-31 to South Bend (North) and Indianapolis (South)
* US-35 to Logansport (North) and Muncie (South)
* IN-931 (former US 31 through Kokomo)
* IN-19 to Kokomo Reservoir (North) and Tipton (South)

* IN-26 to Lafayette (West) and Hartford City (East)

A major roadway traversing through Kokomo, nicknamed &quot;stop light city&quot;, US 31 had become one of the state&#x27;s most congested roadways. In Howard County, there were 15 traffic signals on US 31. As part of the state of Indiana&#x27;s Major Moves Project, US 31 was updated to bypass the city of Kokomo to the east. It has interchanges at SR 26, Boulevard, Markland Avenue, and Touby Pike, as well as where the current SR 931 meets the new US 31. There was a similar change near South Bend and there will be one near Indianapolis. The construction in Howard County cost roughly $340 million. Construction started on the County Road 200 South bridge on November 1, 2008. The new US 31 was opened November 27, 2013, at which time the existing roadway was renamed SR 931.

====Railroads====
* Central Railroad of Indianapolis
* Winamac Southern Railway (formerly part of the Columbus to Chicago Main Line)

The town for many years was a stop on the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s division running on a Chicago-Logansport-Richmond-Hamilton-Cincinnati itinerary. The last named train on the route was the overnight &quot;Buckeye,&quot; whose unnamed successor ended service in 1969. A day train counterpart on the route lingered on at least another year.

====Bus service====
* Miller Transportation provides bus service to Indianapolis and South Bend.
* Kokomo City-Line Trolley A fixed-route transportation system, five bus routes run past a total of exactly 275 stops, passing each stop once every hour, from 6:30 a.m. to 7 p.m., Monday through Friday. The buses also have wireless internet for riders, which like the buses, is free to riders.

=== Groundwater contamination ===
In 1995 the Indiana American Water treatment facility found groundwater beneath the city contaminated with trace amounts of vinyl chloride. In 2007, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management found groundwater at four municipal wells containing vinyl chloride at levels exceeding the EPA maximum contaminant level in raw water.

In 2011, it found one of the monitoring wells, not owned or used by Indiana American Water, had amounts of vinyl chloride that were more than 2,500 times the maximum level for drinking water. IDEM has identified fourteen facilities that handle chlorinated solvents and could be sources to the contamination plume. Some of these potential sources are currently being managed under other authorities but there is no cleanup approach focusing on the ground water plume. Water from several well fields in Kokomo are blended and treated prior to distribution. A water treatment system has been successfully removing the vinyl chloride from the finished drinking water, but this is not a permanent solution to address the contaminated ground water plume.

The site was proposed to the National Priorities List and added to the Superfund in March 2015. No cleanup plan is yet in effect.

<text>Russiaville () is a town in Honey Creek Township, Howard County, Indiana, United States. The population was 1,094 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Kokomo Metropolitan Statistical Area. Russiaville was incorporated sometime between the 1860 and 1870 US Census.

==Etymology==
The town was named for Jean Baptiste de Richardville (whose father&#x27;s surname was Richerville), a Miami chief of French-Miami descent who had relations with the United States government in treaty making in the early nineteenth century. Through the French pronunciation of &quot;Ri-shar-ville,&quot; the name was gradually corrupted and changed to the current spelling; it has been pronounced &quot;Roo-sha-ville&quot; through much of its history.

The apparent association with Russia led to the town high school&#x27;s naming its athletic teams the “Cossacks” until 1949, when county consolidation changed Russiaville High School to Western High School. Some theorize an alternate history, that during the [[Cold War], residents consciously changed the pronunciation of Russiaville&#x27;s name in order to disassociate their town from [[Russia]], the leading state of the [[Soviet Union]], however, the pronunciation, Roo-sha-ville precedes the Cold War by many, many years. A map from the 1840s to the 1850s in the Quaker Collection of [[Earlham College]] in [[Richmond, Indiana]], clearly shows a county named Richardville, and a town Richardville, at the site of present-day Russiaville. Some local history has suggested &quot;Rouchardville&quot; as the earlier spelling, but Richardville is correct.

==History==
Russiaville was laid out in 1845.

Russiaville became a [[Quakers|Quaker]] settlement in the years before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. They created a stop on the [[Underground Railroad]] for fugitive slaves in the antebellum years in nearby [[New London, Indiana|New London]], then the site of the Friends Meeting serving the entire area. A local legend tells that the stop included a tunnel under New London from a safe house to a cave in the hollow of Honey Creek, near the location of the Friends Meetinghouse.

Russiaville is the birthplace of Jonathan Dixon Maxwell (September 3, 1864), builder of the [[Maxwell automobile]]. He is buried there.

Almost all of the town was destroyed on April 11, 1965, by an F4 tornado, which was part of the [[Palm Sunday tornado outbreak of 1965|Palm Sunday Tornado Outbreak]]. With rebuilding, the town had a population of 1,094 at the 2010 census.

In 1985, [[Ryan White]] was an American teenager going to the Western School District&#x27;s Middle School, who became a national poster child for HIV/AIDS in the United States after being denied re-admittance to school following an AIDS diagnosis. The school district faced pressure from many parents and faculty to ban student Ryan White from the campus after his diagnosis of HIV became widely known. The case, and local families&#x27; treatment of the White family, became a focal point in the public debate around funding for HIV treatment and public perception, eventually leading to the [[Ryan White CARE Act]]. The act provides funding to improve availability of care for low-income, uninsured and under-insured victims of AIDS and their families.

<text>Roanoke is a town in Jackson Township, Huntington County, Indiana, United States. The population was 1,762 at the 2020 census. Roanoke is governed by a town council. Town offices include the clerk treasurer, utilities department, police department, and volunteer fire department. The town has a public elementary school. WOWO and WRNP have transmitter towers in Roanoke, along U.S. Highway 24. For many years, television station WPTA was licensed to Roanoke, though that station&#x27;s studios and transmitter have always been located in nearby Fort Wayne.

==History==
Once the hunting and fishing grounds of the Miami Indians, Roanoke became a prosperous commercial center in the mid-19th century. Kiilhsoohkwa (meaning &quot;sun-woman&quot;), the granddaughter of Chief Little Turtle, lived in Roanoke and was known by locals as “the last of the Miami tribe.” 

Roanoke had its start in about 1848, soon after the building of the Wabash and Erie Canal through that territory. The completion of the canal through Jackson Township enticed European-American settlers to the area. In the wake of the canal&#x27;s completion, the town became an important shipping point in the region and a source of supplies for neighboring towns in Allen, Huntington, and Whitley counties. One of the earliest settlers in the area was Jarred Darrow who arrived in 1837. Between 1840 and 1847 the area&#x27;s population swelled and included a large number of persons belonging to the United Brethren Church, the Methodist Church, and the Lutheran Church. Roanoke was incorporated as a town in 1874. The town was named after Roanoke, Virginia.

==Adult store controversy==
Lion&#x27;s Den, a store selling adult sexual products and pornography, opened in Crothersville near the Interstate 65 exit in 2005. From the day the store opened, Christian protestors photographed persons entering the store parking lot day and night from a surveillance structure on frontage property. According to a protest organizer, Pastor Jon Pearce of First Baptist Church of Crothersville, people in the community were motivated by rumors, never substantiated, that Lion&#x27;s Den was &quot;gonna have videos and stuff on bestiality and just all kinds of terrible things about chasing down young girls and raping them.&quot;

The protestors, who called themselves the Uniontown Watchdogs, also wrote down license plates and notified trucking companies that their drivers were allegedly patronizing the store. Photographs of alleged patrons were posted to a web site. Reportedly, &quot;a parole officer from another county ran the plate numbers recorded by the Watchdogs.&quot; The protestors placed signs at the store&#x27;s parking lot entrance which read, &quot;Warning! All license plates are recorded!&quot; and &quot;Over 2 million will see you on war-line.net.&quot; They sometimes yelled comments at persons who entered the property and offered free Bibles.

The protests were not without controversy however. In addition to building a platform to look over a fence constructed by the business to maintain their practice of photographing people walking in and out of the store, several complaints were also issued over the shining of a floodlight in the faces of drivers passing by, in preparation to take a photograph if they entered the property, leading to several near misses with protesters and other autos.

On July 30, 2010, in response to a lawsuit filed by Jackson County, special Bartholomew Circuit Court judge Stephen R. Heimann, a Democrat, ruled that the store violated a county licensing ordinance and must be closed. He ruled that the county could constitutionally bar the business from operating at the location as part of its intent to protect the health, safety, and welfare of county residents, and that the ordinance was content neutral since it did not seek to ban adult businesses. Lion&#x27;s Den violated the ordinance because it was operating within 1,000 feet of a residence. Jackson County commissioners adopted the ordinance three days before Lion&#x27;s Den opened, after they discovered it was going to be an adult business. The store closed within days after the ruling while Lion&#x27;s Den appealed the case. On June 7, 2011, the Court of Appeals of Indiana unanimously affirmed Judge Heimann&#x27;s ruling. Lion&#x27;s Den is an Ohio-based company with about 30 stores across the United States at the time of the Crothersville conflict.

In 2008, Melvin Ray Owen, a spokesman and organizer for the anti-pornography protesters was arrested for sexual battery on a girl of 16. Reverend Roger Smith, who testified on behalf of Owen, told the court, that Owen was &quot;touchy-feely. He hugs everybody in church. It is out of character for him be anything but someone who wants to do good.” Owen claimed that he was the victim of an aggressive girl who had been propositioning him: “I touched her breast, I did. I also blowed on her hair and punched her ribs. It wasn’t an accident and I’ll tell you why. I touched her to try to get her off my lap and she wouldn’t get off it.&quot; After changing his plea to guilty, Owen was sentenced to 90 days in jail and 90 days home incarceration.

==Drug bootlegging and a homicide==
On February 10, 2005, Crothersville was featured in a &quot;New York Times&quot; article about the town&#x27;s alleged &quot;scourge of methamphetamine.&quot; The &quot;Times&quot;&#x27; narrative was that a town &quot;where everyone seems somehow related,&quot; is &quot;seemingly transformed&quot; by the death of a 10-year-old, Katlyn Collman, who &quot;police say...stumbled on (sic) someone with methamphetamine...&quot; The story highlights a Crothersville stricken with fear after the death and the discovery of two facilities for making bootleg methamphetamine. Without explaining who they are or where they have gone, the article claims that &quot;Shady characters no longer stalk the streets of the one-stoplight town, where ribbons of blue, Katie&#x27;s favorite color, hang from utility poles and porches. Gone, too, are the bike-riding and dog-walking youngsters, now let outside to play only with their parents, or in groups.&quot; One father &quot;said he checks what his 10-year-old son and 7-year-old daughter are wearing each morning, for fear of having to describe them to the police.&quot; The article claims that in &quot;Jackson County, which includes Crothersville, meth-related arrests skyrocketed to 116 in 2004 from 29 in 2002.&quot; Pastor Jon Pearce, who helped to organize the protest against Lion&#x27;s Den, is quoted regarding the purported illegal drug problem: &quot;If we had a brothel move into town, people would close it down instantly. If we had an X-rated movie house come, it&#x27;d be gone within a week. But this has been here. It is a monster. We didn&#x27;t know what kind of monster it was.&quot; The &quot;Times&quot; article includes no crime statistics for Crothersville that might affirm the implication that the town was dangerous.

On May 25, 2005, the &quot;Times&quot; reported that, &quot;Tossing aside their original theory that a 10-year-old Indiana girl was murdered because she saw people making methamphetamine, prosecutors on Friday dropped charges against the man whose statements led them to that belief, charging instead another man connected by DNA and other physical evidence to the crime.&quot; The &quot;Times&quot; quoted a local merchant claiming to have &quot;sold 2,000 T-shirts with Katie&#x27;s photograph to people in four states, [who] said that even if the methamphetamine theory had no merit, the murder &#x27;shined a light on the drug problem&#x27; in town.&quot; The &quot;Times&quot; reported, &quot;Steven Drizin, legal director of the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University, said the case had the hallmark of a false, coerced confession..&quot; The &quot;Times&quot; did not refer to or retract its own inaccurate reporting in the February article. CBS did its part to promote hysteria with a report titled, &quot;Girl&#x27;s Murder Amplifies Drug War.&quot;

Anthony Ray Stockelman, pleaded guilty to abducting, molesting, and murdering the child and received a sentence of life in prison. He had no prior criminal record, and no cited connection to methamphetamine. A cousin of the victim, serving a burglary sentence in the same facility where Stockelman was held, was charged for tattooing &quot;Katie&#x27;s Revenge&quot; on the forehead of her killer.

The city is known as the &quot;Crossroads of Southern Indiana&quot; for its location at the intersection of two major north–south and east–west railroads, which cross each other in the downtown area (and are still operating). The north–south line (the Jeffersonville, Madison and Indianapolis Railroad) was built in the 1840s and connected Indianapolis to the Ohio River at Jeffersonville. The east-west line (the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad) was built in the 1850s, connecting Cincinnati with St. Louis. The first settlers arrived at the intersection of these railroads - Seymour - in the spring of 1853. Additionally, since the 1920s two major U.S. Highways have also crossed at Seymour: U.S. Route 31 (Mackinaw City, MI to Spanish Fort, AL) and U.S. Route 50 (Ocean City, MD to Sacramento, CA). The southern section of U.S. Route 31 has largely been replaced in importance by the adjacent Interstate 65 (I-65).

The companies Aisin USA (the US branch of the Fortune Global 500 Company) and Rose Acre Farms (the 2nd largest egg producer in the United States) are headquartered in Seymour, and Cummins (another Fortune Global 500 Company) operates a plant in the area. Walmart operates a large distribution center east of the city near the junction of I-65 and US-50. The city is home to the 2nd largest high school gymnasium in the United States by seating capacity (Lloyd E. Scott Gymnasium), and Freeman Field, a historically significant WWII airbase that is now a civilian airport.

==History==

===19th century===
The land near Seymour was originally inhabited by the Lenape Indians as they were moved west from their lands along the Delaware River valley on the east coast of the 13 colonies. The Indiana Territory was established on July 4, 1800, by an act signed into law by President John Adams. It initially included the present-day states of Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and parts of Michigan and Minnesota. The Treaty of 1800, also known as the Convention of 1800, was signed on September 30, 1800, between the United States and France, ending the Quasi-War and reestablishing peaceful relations and trade between the two countries. The treaty was needed to end the ongoing naval conflict and to remove areas of friction between the two nations, ultimately facilitating the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.

The Treaty of Grouseland in 1805 opened the area to white settlers. Following the Pidgeon Roost Massacre in 1812, a local skirmish known as the Battle of Tipton&#x27;s Island took place between settlers and a group of hostile Indian raiders. Between 1811 and 1815, Native Americans killed fifteen settlers. By 1816, only five families remained in the area. Indiana became a state on December 11, 1816. In 1817, the State of Indiana established a blockhouse to facilitate trade with the Lenape Indians until the natives ceded the area after the Treaty of St. Mary&#x27;s. From 1822 to 1832, the county experienced significant depopulation.

Seymour was established and mapped out on April 27, 1852, by Meedy and Eliza Ewing Shields, near the 1809 Indian Treaty Corner and about two miles south of Rockford, Indiana. This location was the terminus of the north-south railroad at the Driftwood River before the purchase of 1828, and the construction of the rail bridge over the White River. At this time, the Driftwood River and Rockford were the beginning of the wild frontier and Indian lands north of the river. In the late 1840s, a north-south railroad connecting the Ohio River at Jeffersonville with new state capital in Indianapolis was built, crossing the Shields&#x27; farm. In 1852, an east-west railroad was being surveyed through Jackson County, and Meedy Shields convinced the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad to pass through his property. In return, he agreed to name the town after the railroad&#x27;s civil engineer, Henry C. Seymour, although some sources mention J. Seymour, the surveyor. Contradicting this, another account states that in 1852, Captain Meedy Shields persuaded Hezekiah Cook Seymour to route the east-west Ohio and Mississippi Railroad through his land, naming the city in Seymour&#x27;s honor.

The first settlers arrived in the spring of 1853. On June 29, 1854, the first train on the new Ohio and Mississippi Railroad stopped in Seymour and fired a celebratory cannon shot. Unfortunately, four men were killed in the resulting explosion from the poorly aimed fusillade.

Seymour was mockingly called a &quot;mule crossing&quot; due to its slow initial growth and the lack of interest from railroad companies. Significant development didn&#x27;t occur until 1857, when the state legislature, influenced by local landowner and Indiana State Senator Meedy Shields, passed a law requiring all trains to stop at railroad intersections. This law, aimed at increasing safety before the widespread use of semaphores, boosted the value of land around these intersections and made them safer for warehousing.

Meedy Shields placed advertisements in the nearby Cincinnati and Louisville newspapers, offering a free lot and $100 to any congregation willing to establish a church in the city. Charles White of the Presbyterian Church was the first to respond in 1855. In 1858, Blish Mill became the town&#x27;s first mill. By 1881, Seymour had three mills within its city limits. The large grain tower still stands near the railroad intersection in the center of town.

Seymour was once a stop on the Underground Railroad. On April 20, 1860, an Adams Express package shipped from Nashville, Tennessee, and addressed to &quot;Hannah Johnson [care of] Levi Coffin&quot; burst open at Seymour while en route to Cincinnati. Levi Coffin was a leading Hoosier abolitionist and the unofficial leader of the Underground Railroad. The package contained a person fleeing slavery and seeking freedom in the North. A similar incident had occurred earlier in Kentucky. The true identity of &quot;Hannah Johnson&quot; remains a mystery. Although Indiana was a &quot;free state&quot;, Article XIII of the state constitution of 1851 made it illegal for African Americans to settle in Indiana, and the Fugitive Slave Act permitted bounty hunters to capture and return people to slavery. The fugitive, later identified as Alexander McClure, was arrested and returned to Louisville and then to his owner in Nashville, Tennessee.

====The Civil War====

Due to its strategic location along rail lines, and with the large cities of Indianapolis, Chicago, and Detroit to the north and St. Louis to the west, Seymour was an important waypoint for the movement of men and supplies to the front during the war. Despite southern Indiana&#x27;s strong Copperheads political sentiment, the city of Seymour and the surrounding area raised three separate infantry units for service in the Union Army. Volunteers from Seymour were organized at Camp Heffron in Seymour - later the location of Shields High School. These included the 50th Indiana Infantry Regiment,commanded by former Indiana Secretary of State, Colonel Cyrus L. Dunham, as well as Company C of the 10th Indiana Cavalry Regiment. The 50th Indiana was conspicuous at the Battle of Parker&#x27;s Crossroads against Nathan Bedford Forrest, as was the 10th Indiana Cavalry in skirmishes near Pulaski and during the 1864 Nashville Campaign. Company H of the 6th Indiana Infantry Regiment was also raised in Seymour, and commanded by Captain Fielder A Jones, who would end the war as a Brevet Brigadier General. These men fought at Shiloh (2nd Day), Stones River, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, and through the Atlanta Campaign, ending in the capture of that city.

By 1865, Fielder Jones had been transferred to the 8th Indiana Cavalry and promoted to colonel, only a couple of months before being brevetted to Brigadier General. Early in the war, Jones had been &quot;body shot&quot; by a bushwhacker he later killed, W. A. Carter recalled decades later. &quot;No Surrender&quot; Jones survived his wound, then later raised another infantry unit of Jackson County men who elected him colonel. &quot;When the company was organized, a group of Seymour women made a beautiful silk American flag and presented it to the Colonel. The presentation was made on the platform of what was then the O&amp;M railroad station located in what [later became] the east warehouse of the Travis Carter Company at the corner of Fourth and Broadway. Mrs. George Williams, wife of one of Seymour&#x27;s first jewelers, made the presentation speech. &#x27;The enemy will never get this flag while I live,&#x27; the Colonel declared in accepting the flag and he kept his word.&quot; Carter said the flag came back with General Jones and his company, but other stories said Jones never returned to Seymour. After being mustered out, Jones headed to Missouri to practice law.

On July 10, 1863, as Confederate Brigadier General John Hunt Morgan and his Cavalry sacked nearby Salem, Major General John Love of the Indiana Legion (militia) arrived in Seymour from New Albany to take command of the city defenses, Seymour being most important due to its railroad crossing. Over the next day, Love used Seymour as a staging ground to gather a force to repel Morgan&#x27;s next attack, which they believed would target the Ohio &amp; Mississippi Railroad either at Mitchell, Seymour, or Vernon. His force included elements of the 63rd Indiana and 69th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiments, the 1st Michigan Sharpshooters, the 15th Indiana (Von Sehlen&#x27;s) Battery of Light Artillery and a few Indiana Legion militia units. As Morgan moved on Vernon on July 11, Love took his force (about 1,000 men) from Seymour to meet him, placing Captain Meedy Shields in charge of the Seymour defenses in his absence. Shields had organized and trained many local and mounted militia units, and in Love&#x27;s words, &quot;rendered invaluable service&quot; during the Morgan&#x27;s Raid crisis.

On January 20, 1864, during the transfer of Confederate prisoners of war, six officers escaped. One was later recaptured in town. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reports that on January 22, 1864, a &quot;Soldier&#x27;s riot&quot; took place, wherein two soldiers were killed, and several others were injured.

The 50th Indiana Infantry Regiment lost 3 officers and 54 enlisted men killed and mortally wounded and 3 officers and 158 enlisted men by disease for a total of 218 casualties during the war. Colonel Dunham, a Democrat, was accused of harboring Confederate sympathies and mustered out of the regiment in 1863 under a cloud of suspicion. Lt. Colonel Heffron, who was poorly regarded by the men of the regiment, was also dismissed from the army and replaced by Major Samuel T Wells, a Vallonia, Indiana, native, Mexican-American war veteran, and former Jackson County Sheriff. Wells would go on to command the regiment after Durham&#x27;s resignation until the 50th was dissolved and all men transferred to the 52nd Indiana Infantry Regiment which was also garrisoned in Mobile, Alabama, and remained there until the war&#x27;s end.

During the Civil War, Seymour and Jackson County fielded a total of 2,571 volunteers for the Union cause.

====The Reno Era====
After the war, local veterans organized the Ellsworth Post 20 of the G.A.R. At its zenith, the post included two hundred and twenty-two local citizens who had served the Union during the war as members. During its long existence, the organization included many prominent community members. The Ellsworth Post was active in local charities, organized burial services for local veterans, and conducted official observances on Decoration Day. The final member of the post, James H Boak, lived to be 98 years old. He died in 1942, closing one of the longest-running G.A.R. chapters in existence.

An infamous local murder occurred in January 1866, when a traveling merchant, Moore Woodmansee, 42, on his way to Cincinnati, disappeared while staying at the Rader House. The Rader House was operated by proprietor Captain George Rader, a purported Reno Associate, and was the center of gambling, theft, prostitution, and a string of mysterious disappearances. Months after he disappeared, the headless body of Woodmansee was found downriver in the East Fork of the White River; then known as the Driftwood River. Rader was implicated in the murder. Two local witnesses were murdered. Rader and his son-in-law were ultimately acquitted but forced to leave town.

A robbery of the Adams Express Car on the east-west Ohio and Mississippi line near Brownstown was reported in July 1866. That night, the perpetrators were chased by a local vigilance committee of 300 men that continued into the Rockford area. Three days later, the Reno brothers had been identified as the gang&#x27;s leaders and newspapers were recounting the notorious deeds of the family. Later that year, Seymour was the site of the world&#x27;s first successful moving train robbery during peacetime. It was committed by the local Reno Gang, on October 6, 1866, just east of town, starting in the Adams Express Company car of the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad. Some members of the gang were later lynched at Hangman&#x27;s Crossing outside town. The insolvent Ohio and Mississippi Railroad was reorganized in 1867 as the Ohio and Mississippi Railway.

About 1876, a general strike of approximately 500 railroad men occurred at Seymour and nearby North Vernon, Indiana, led by armed brakemen, engineers, and other railroad employees who had not been paid for two and a half months by the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad. A paper reported that the communities of Seymour and North Vernon were armed and in revolt. A contingent of US Marshals and detectives was sent from Cincinnati to end the strike. All passenger and cargo service through Seymour and North Vernon was suspended during the strike. The Ohio and Mississippi Railway was purchased in 1893 by B&amp;O Southwestern Railroad.

The town&#x27;s first high school was built in 1871 on the vacant lot of the disbanded civil war encampment. Frank B Shields, a Seymour native, former MIT professor, and inventor of Barbasol shaving cream, subsequently donated the adjacent land needed for the construction of the James Shields Memorial Gym.

In 1880, the Seymour Weekly Democrat noted that Seymour boasted a population of nearly 5,000, four schools including Shields High School, a Catholic School and two German schools with 700 students; four hotels including the newly built Hotel Jonas, the Faulconer, the City Hotel and the Mansion House.

During his Western Railroad Tour in the Fall of 1890, President Benjamin Harrison (the only Hoosier President) stopped in Seymour on October 7 and gave a short speech to a crowd of 2,000 people, in which he spoke particularly to the school children present about the importance of education.

During the years prior to the turn of the 20th century, Seymour saw a significant influx of Dutch and German migrants of the Lutheran faith. These migrants eventually established many successful local farms and businesses. These pioneers&#x27; influence continues today and can be seen in the city&#x27;s annual Oktoberfest celebration.

On October 6, 1896, the Democratic Nominee for President, William Jennings Bryan, stopped in Seymour and gave a short campaign speech at Shields Park to a crowd. Bryan had been selected at the Democratic Convention in July following his famous &quot;Cross of Gold&quot; speech. His selection would lead to a realignment of the parties and the beginning of the Fourth Party System. Bryan holds the record for the youngest nominee for President ever chosen by a political party, at age 36. He would go on to lose the 1896 Presidential Election to Republican Nominee, William McKinley, one month later.

===20th century===

Seymour fielded its own minor league team, the Seymour Reds, beginning in 1900. Pee Wee Reese once played with the Seymour Reds before being called up to the majors. The team had its own field, Redlands Park, north of Shields City Park.

The Ahlbrand Carriage Company, a builder of buggies and custom coaches was incorporated in Seymour by Ephriam, Albert, and Walter Ahlbrand of Seymour.

The Seymour Public Library opened to the public in January 1905, following a grant of $10,000 from the Carnegie Foundation in 1903 led by the Public-School Superintendent and President of the Seymour Public Library Board, Professor H.C. Montgomery. Efforts to bring a library to Seymour began twenty years early in 1881. Early library collections were housed in a local bookshop and then at Shields High School until the new Carnegie Library opened. The public library was part of more than $2.6 million in grants issued in the state of Indiana for more than 160 libraries: more than any other state.

On October 22, 1908, William Howard Taft, the Republican Nominee for President of the United States, made a campaign speech in Seymour to 10,000 people at the Chestnut Street railroad crossing during his whistle-stop tour of Indiana two weeks before the election. He would go on to win the Presidency.

In 1913, the Great Flood hit Seymour causing widespread death and destruction. It was the deadliest natural disaster to ever hit the area. The East Fork of the White River reached above the level recorded in the flood of 1884.

In 1914, H. Vance Swope, a landscape artist who spent his youth in Seymour, donated many of his own works and paintings he acquired during his career to Seymour&#x27;s Art League. Eventually, those works became part of the H. Vance Swope Gallery in the new Public Library. This collection contains important works by Charlotte B. Coman and other favorites from Swope.

====World Wars====
On May 7, 1915, leading city-industrialist and scion of the Thompson family, Eldridge Blish Thompson died during the sinking of the ocean liner RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot;. A memorial scholarship was funded in his name by his family at Seymour&#x27;s Shields High School for any student accepted to Yale University. The sinking of the ocean liner was an important factor in President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s decision to ask Congress for a declaration of war in April 1917.

During World War I, nine Seymour natives died in combat. Seymour&#x27;s first municipal airport, the White River Valley Flying Field, was located on the Henry Ahlert farm (once owned by the Renos) near the White River north of the city.

While campaigning in Indiana just prior to the 1920 President Election, Republican Nominee, Warren G. Harding, gave a speech in Seymour on October 15 to an enthusiastic crowd regarding foreign policy and his opposition to the League of Nations. Harding would go on to win the presidency by a huge margin in both the popular vote and electoral college.

In 1934, Seymour police officer John Pfaffenberger was shot and killed by three assailants after he attempted to stop their car after they stole a few dollars&#x27; worth of fuel from a gas station east of town. One defendant, Nashville, Indiana, native Edward Coffin, was subsequently sentenced to death and sent to Indiana&#x27;s electric chair for the murder of Officer Pfaffenberger. His co-defendants were sentenced to lengthy prison terms.

Kenneth Earl Cockrum, serving on the U.S.S. Arizona became the first casualty of the war from Seymour. During World War II, the US government purchased of land southwest of town for use as an airfield. Local veterans initially proposed to name the field after US Navy Seaman Cockrum who died at Pearl Harbor. Freeman Army Airfield operated from 1942 to 1946. The base was first used for twin-engine training. The first class graduated on April 29 and went on to fly multi-engine aircraft such as the B-24 Liberator, B-17 Flying Fortress, B-29 Superfortress, and various other medium bombers and transport aircraft. Twin-engine training continued with a total of 19 classes of students graduating from Freeman Field using a total of 250 Beechcraft AT-10 Wichita trainers. The last graduates were in May 1944; 4,245 total cadets.

Freeman Army Airfield was the first helicopter base in the US. The first instructor pilots arrived on June 30 and preparations for the helicopter training were made in great secrecy, as in 1944 very few people had seen one and the technology was new and revolutionary. The group assigned to coordinate their arrival was known as &quot;Section B-O&quot;. A total of six Sikorsky R-4 helicopters were assigned for training, flown directly to Freeman from the Sikorsky plant at Bridgeport, Connecticut. This was the longest-distance flight of any formation of helicopters at the time.

The Freeman Field Mutiny occurred in 1945, in which African American members of the 477th Bombardment Group attempted to integrate an all-white officers&#x27; club at Freeman Army Air Corps Base. The mutiny is generally regarded by historians of the Civil Rights Movement as an important step toward full integration of the armed forces and as a model for later efforts to integrate public facilities through civil disobedience.

Nearing the end of WWII, Freeman Field was designated the Foreign Aircraft Evaluation Center for US Army Air Technical Intelligence. After the end of the war in Europe, captured German and Italian aircraft were collected by &quot;Operation Lusty&quot;. Freeman Field was also charged with the mission to receive and catalog United States equipment for display at the present and for the future AAF museum. However, these operations, including the helicopter training missions were moved to other locations, and Freeman Field was deactivated and deeded to the city of Seymour in 1946. Future astronaut Gus Grissom enlisted as an aviation training cadet at Freeman Field in 1944.

====Mid century====
During the last week of June 1952, the city of Seymour held a week-long centennial celebration that included concerts, parades, a re-enactment of the Reno Brothers train robbery, contests, and a play entitled &quot;The Seymour Story&quot;. The B&amp;O Railroad loaned Engine #25 and several cars from their Baltimore Museum for use in the Reno reenactment scenes, and the event was featured in &quot;B &amp; O Magazine&quot;. During the event, local industries paid their employers in silver dollars to commemorate the event.

Beginning in 1959, the city&#x27;s former high school, Shields High School, was closed and all students transferred to the new Seymour High School west of town. By 1970, the school corporation completed the construction of the second-largest school gymnasium in the United States. In 1981, the gym was renamed the &quot;Lloyd E Scott&quot; gymnasium in honor of the Indiana Hall of Fame basketball coach.
Police Officer Donald M Winn was killed in the line of duty on November 7, 1961, during a botched robbery. His murderer was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Officer Winn&#x27;s widow received the National Police Officer Association&#x27;s Medal of Merit for Valor, the organization highest award, on his behalf during ceremonies later that year.

Shortly after opening a local franchise in the area, on October 20, 1965, during a ceremony in Seymour, Colonel Harland Sanders, owner and originator of Kentucky Fried Chicken was initialed as a member alongside thirteen local residents into the local Elks Lodge, #462. Sanders had a long association with Seymour through cousins and a nephew living in town.

Seven Seymour servicemen were killed in action during the Vietnam War. The highest-ranking soldier killed in action from Seymour was Command Sergeant Major William Henry Clevenger, United States Army who enlisted in the United States Army during World War II. He was awarded the Silver Star and the Distinguished Flying Cross.

====Late century====
In 1970, future Rock and Roll Hall of Famer John Mellencamp graduated from Seymour High School and briefly attended nearby Vincennes University before returning to Seymour and working for the local telephone company while pursuing a music career. Led by Mellencamp&#x27;s new management and record label, the city of Seymour dedicated its Oktoberfest parade to young Mellencamp on October 2, 1976. On that day, the mayor declared it &quot;Johnny Cougar Day,&quot; and the city celebrated by parading &quot;Johnny Cougar&quot; through downtown to help promote his debut album, the Chestnut Street Incident.

Various murders occurred in the Seymour area that were linked to Rose Acre Farms in the 1970s. Employees Theresa Osborne, Mike Reece, and Carrie Croucher all from Rose Acre with ties to founder David Rust died under mysterious circumstances. Mysteriously, Theresa Osborne&#x27;s body was found in the trunk of her burnt and abandoned vehicle weeks after her disappearance. Even years later, the deaths remained under investigation. Louisville Courier Journal reporters published a series of articles. Investigations by local authorities into the deaths did not result in any charges against David Rust, who died in 2004.

Seymour police officer Jack Osborne died after being hit by a motorist at the scene of a traffic accident on Interstate 65 on August 15, 1981. Sadly, he was the third Seymour police officer to die in the line of duty.

After being found guilty of four counts of accepting bribes while in office, Christopher Moritz resigned as mayor on March 29, 1983. Because he was sentenced to five years in prison and barred from holding public office for ten years until William Bailey assumed office. Donald Scott served the remaining balance of Moritz&#x27;s term as Mayor. Moritz began serving his sentence on December 8, 1984.

On March 29, 1983, Christopher Moritz resigned as mayor after a judge found him guilty of four counts of accepting bribes while in office. He was sentenced to five years in prison and barred from holding public office for ten years. Moritz began serving his sentence on December 8, 1984. Donald Scott served the remaining balance of Moritz&#x27;s term until William Bailey assumed office.

In 1985, Mellencamp released &quot;Small Town&quot; a song written about his hometown. It reached #6 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. MTV included the associated music video in frequent rotation. This video, and approximately five others, were filmed in around the Seymour area during this time. The videos included shots of Riverview Cemetery, Rockford, the Rok-Sey Arena, downtown Seymour, and cameos of many locals. This, with the release of his &quot;Rain on the Scarecrow&quot; single and music video, increased awareness of the plight of rural American farmers in general and life in Seymour specifically. Many regional and national media outlets produced segments about Seymour during this timeframe.

Future Indiana University basketball coach Teri Moren graduated from Seymour High School in 1987 and was named an Indiana All-Star that year. She led the Seymour Owls to four sectional titles, two regional championships, a semi-state win, and a 1987 state finals appearance.

Seymour&#x27;s east-west railroad, controlled by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad since the previous century merged in 1987 into CSX Transportation, creating one of the largest Class I railroads in North America.

In 1989, the Stardust Theater, a local landmark for fifty years, shuttered its gates for the last time. The 550-spot drive-in first opened on May 19, 1949, and aired its last feature films &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; and &quot;Karate Kid III&quot; on September 30. The theater was popular for showing movies, cartoons, and dusk-to-dawn movie marathons. The operator of the theater said the decision to close the theater was purely economic, the land the theater sat on was just too valuable. The owner, Florence Carter sold the property to developers who turned the entire site into an outlet mall.

On July 8, 1991, the former Lynn Hotel, a local landmark first opened on July 1, 1883, collapsed due to disrepair and neglect. The city previously purchased the property for $35,000 with an eye on redeveloping the building into city offices. Other groups had offered to purchase and save the property before it was leveled including John Mellencamp, an investment group from California, and local community activists.

Despite efforts from local community leaders, the city of Seymour and then-mayor John Burkhart ordered the leveling of the historic Vondee Theater on September 24, 1993. Marina Gill, President of the Historic Preservation Foundation said, &quot;This is just negligence&quot; when asked about the decision to level the structure.

On May 29, 1997, the former Shields High School, first constructed in 1910, was raised during a botched demolishment of a smaller portion of the building, the girls&#x27; gym. The structure was privately owned after the construction of Seymour Middle School, and once housed a private bible college. Building inspectors determined that was too much damage and the structure was unsafe.

On Christmas Day 1998, the historic Walton Hotel, first known at the Rader House, and then the Faulkner House, the Jonas Hotel, and the Centennial Hotel, burned to the ground in an accidental fire that killed one person. The property was first built in 1854, was one of the oldest structures in Seymour, was in the process of being restored, and was being used as low-income housing at the time of the fire. The structure was the third important historic downtown building to fall during the nineties.

===21st century===
Thanks to the efforts of then Lt. Governor John Mutz and community leaders at the Jackson County Industrial Development Corporation, Aisin constructed a factory in Seymour in 1986, with production beginning in 1989 with wide public support. Initial estimates suggested 200 new employees, but by 2020, Aisin employed more than 2,000 local residents. This factory has since been expanded and supplies components for Honda, General Motors, Mitsubishi, Nissan and Toyota.

The north-south railroad line that serves Seymour was purchased by the Louisville and Indiana Railroad from Conrail in March 1994. The Seymour Diamond Crossing is a good place to also watch the east-west railroad line, which CSX upgraded in 2016 for reliable higher speed operation. The Louisville and Indiana Railroad served as a short-line railroad to provide switching services for access to the CSX mainline.

Immigration from San Sebastián Coatán, Guatemala, began about 1989 as indigenous Chuj people found the American Dream in the United States. As word spread to their families and friends in their hometown about the quality of life in Seymour, more families journeyed from their poverty-stricken part of Guatemala to a newer, more fruitful life in the U.S. Immigrants from Guatemala as of 2020 make up more than 10% of the local population.

In November 2019, the city unveiled a large mural of John Mellencamp, painted on the side of a local guitar store. The store&#x27;s owner, Larry McDonald, is a longtime friend and former bandmate of Mellencamp. The Mellencamp family donated $50,000 to help turn the former parking lot into a green space so more people could enjoy the mural painted by artist Sue Bliss.

In October 2024, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita issued a civil investigative demand to ensure the city complies with state immigration policies. Specifically, the AG requested records to determine if the city is acting as a &quot;De Facto&quot; sanctuary city and to produce data on individuals who may have committed the specific crime of driving without a license, as well as all misdemeanor violations except for driving without a license. On the same day, Seymour Mayor Matt Nicholson canceled a regularly scheduled city council meeting. In response, Seymour Common Council member Drew Storey held an impromptu community meeting to address concerns about the city&#x27;s rapidly growing population. Census data shows that over the past 20 years, Seymour&#x27;s Hispanic population increased from 4.8% to approximately 13%, and the overall population grew by about 3,000 people. &quot;The growth that we&#x27;ve seen and experienced in just the past few years is exceeding our ability to deal with it, as we&#x27;re seeing through other communities throughout the state,&quot; said State Representative and Seymour resident Jim Lucas. During the same twenty-year period, Seymour has seen an increase in crimes stemming from immigration; including the 2024 arrests of one undocumented immigrant for performing dentistry without a license, and a second for selling prescription medicine.

===Folklore===
After they were hanged, legend has it the Reno Brothers were allegedly buried together under a single stone alone atop a hill in the old city cemetery. Outraged, local citizens refused to bury their relatives with the Renos. The Riverview Cemetery was eventually built and many famous former occupants of the city cemetery. Later, a Reno plot with headstones for each of the brothers was constructed in the old cemetery close to the road to appease the tourists and the curious.

Freeman field was home to captured Nazi aircraft after World War Two, including captured jet aircraft, and V-1 and V-2 rockets. However, the base was closed shortly thereafter, and the base commander ordered many aircraft to be buried at the site.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Seymour has a total area of , of which (or 99.96%) is land and (or 0.04%) is water.

===Topography===
The area is part of the Scottsburg lowlands geographic region of Southern Indiana. This area is characterized by its relatively flat terrain, which contrasts with the rugged hills of the nearby Norman Uplands and the Knobstone Escarpment. The lowlands are formed from older, more easily eroded shales, which have created a landscape distinct from the surrounding uplands and escarpments.

Scoop the Loop is a local weekend car show that started in 2011 but can trace its origins back to the years following WWII. In Seymour, like many small towns in America, with the rise of car culture, rock and roll, and teenagers with free time, cruising downtown to meet and make new friends and show off cars became a way of life in Seymour. Seymour used to be so popular for cruising that teens would come from eleven surrounding counties. But, starting in the 80s, some local merchants complained and alleged illegal activities were occurring. In the 90s, without any city ordinance to prohibit the activity, the local government would block many of the roads downtown and popular parking lots. This effectively killed the practice in Seymour as happened in nearby Columbus, North Vernon, and Seymour. But, cruising was reborn in 2011 by local cruising enthusiasts two started a yearly event held on one Saturday each August. Ironically, local merchants and restaurants support the event as a way to draw customers back to the downtown area.

<text>Rensselaer is a city located along the Iroquois River in Marion Township, Jasper County, Indiana, United States.

Saint Joseph&#x27;s College is located just south of the city limits.

==History==
This settlement, first platted on June 12, 1839, was originally named &quot;Newton&quot; and was established at the rapids of the Iroquois River. By 1844, it had been renamed &quot;Rensselaer&quot;, after James Van Rensselaer, a merchant from Utica, New York, who came to the area after his business failed in the Panic of 1837. He took over the land from Joseph D. Yeoman, who had established a farm some years earlier and had begun to plan the village.

St. Joseph Indian Normal School was established in 1888 by St. Katherine Drexel, an heiress from Philadelphia, who donated $50,000 for the education of Catholic American Indian boys. The school trained 60 boys annually until 1896. The school was operated by the Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions.

In addition to St. Joseph Indian Normal School, the Jasper County Courthouse, Oren F. and Adelia Parker House, Rensselaer Carnegie Library, and Rensselaer Courthouse Square Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==

The Iroquois River, a tributary of the Kankakee River, hence part of the Illinois River watershed, flows from east to west through the southern part of the city.

U.S. Route 231 and Indiana State Road 114 intersect in the downtown area. US-231 leads north to DeMotte and south to Remington, while State Road 114 leads east to U.S. Route 421 and west to Interstate 65. Via I-65, Rensselaer is north of Lafayette and south of Gary.

<text>Pennville is a town in Penn Township, Jay County, Indiana, United States. The population was 621 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
The history of Pennville began when Samuel Grisell and Moses Hamilton left their homes in Columbiana County, Ohio, in the spring of 1834 to search for government land for a permanent home. Their journey led them to Jay County, Indiana, and on February 10, 1835, Grisell received a Land Patent at the General Land Office at Fort Wayne, purchasing the land &quot;for the North East quarter of Section thirty-five, in Township twenty-four of Range twelve,&quot; which contained . Hamilton was the first to move to the new area, and Grisell came shortly thereafter. It is generally accepted, although not proven, that Grisell then platted the land into a town in August 1836, and named it New Lisbon, presumably after the Village of Lisbon in his home county of Columbiana County, Ohio. New Lisbon was short lived and the name of the town changed to Camden around 1837 because there was another town of the same name in Indiana.

Grisell was a member of the Hicksite Quaker faith, mostly country Friends who perceived urban Friends as worldly, a group which split from Orthodox Friends in 1827 due to the views of Elias Hicks. As early as 1841 there were Friends Monthly Meetings in Camden. A post office was established in Camden on January 19, 1839, with John D. Jones as postmaster. The change to the town name of Pennville was gradual and began when the post office was applied for at Camden. Since the new post office could not be called Camden, as that name was already being used by the post office at Camden in Carroll County, Indiana, the new post office was named Penn, allegedly by Grisell, who was a great admirer of William Penn, the famous Quaker. Since Camden no longer existed after an earlier collapse of the corporation, and the post office was named Penn, this caused confusion and more and more the town was called Pennville. The oil and gas boom that began in the 1880s increased business to such an extent that the people felt there should be a legal name for the town. In 1905 a petition was presented to the Jay County Commissioners asking that the town be incorporated under the name of Pennville.

Pennville has had two high schools, the first being organized around 1890 and existing until 1910. The second Pennville High School was built in 1911 on Jones Hill (sometimes called Gregg Hill) and was in session until 1975, when the schools of five Jay County communities – Pennville, Portland, Bryant, Redkey and Dunkirk - were consolidated into Jay County High School, outside Portland.

From 1903 until 1917, the Cincinnati, Bluffton and Chicago Railroad, sometimes referred to as the CB&amp;C, ran through Pennville. Provident Hospital, a precursor to the Caylor-Nickel Clinic in Bluffton, Wells County, Indiana, existed in Pennville from November 1, 1907, until 1917.

===Twin Hills===
The Twin Hills lie approximately 2–3 miles east, north-east of Pennville. Technically &quot;moraines,&quot; accumulations of unconsolidated glacial debris formed by early glaciers, the hills range 100–150 foot high and are made up mostly of gravel and sand. Only one of the hills has been left intact, due to the high gravel content being used for roads and railroads.

There is also a legend with Twin Hills as told by Sparkle Crowe. A young couple were having a picnic on the southern hill during the time of horse drawn buggies. For whatever reason the man killed the woman causing her ghost to occasionally be seen haunting the area.

===Underground Railroad and Eliza Harris Marker===
Founded by Hicksite Quakers, who were early abolitionists, Pennville and the surrounding area is rich in the history of the Underground Railroad. Approximately miles north of Pennville on Indiana State Road 1, near Balbec, Indiana, a marker was erected in 1923 to mark the site of the pioneer home of Jimmy and Rachel Silliven, an important &quot;station&quot; of the Underground Railroad. The marker memorializes the local legend that the real run-away slave, on whom the character of Eliza Harris of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; was based, stopped at the Silliven home on her way to freedom. The marker bears the inscription:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;A station on the Underground Railroad&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Tradition says Eliza Harris&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Of Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin fame&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Rested here in her flight to Canada&quot;.

<text>Hanover is a town in Hanover Township, Jefferson County, Indiana, United States. Located along the Ohio River, the town&#x27;s population was 3,546 at the 2010 census.

==History==

===Logan&#x27;s Point===

During the late eighteenth century, the area today known as the state of Indiana was a part of the Northwest Territory in the new United States. This large area west of the Appalachians and north of the Ohio River had been ceded by Great Britain after the Revolutionary War. It consisted of the area later organized as the states of Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, and parts of Minnesota. At that time, there were few European settlements on the northern bank of the Ohio River, although French colonists had settled in the west Illinois Country along the Mississippi River. Kentucky, which developed on the southern banks of the Ohio, was originally considered part of Virginia. In 1792 it was granted statehood after becoming more densely settled by European Americans. Prior to the early nineteenth-century European-American settlement of the Hanover area, its predominant inhabitants were the Shawnee people.

George Logan grew up in a farming household in the area of Lexington, Kentucky. Soon after the turn of the year in 1801, young Logan loaded a barge with produce and embarked on a trading journey westward on the Ohio River, ultimately to sell the produce in New Orleans. He later noted that there were no European-American settlements in the area between present-day Carrollton, Kentucky and Louisville. He said both banks of the river were covered in thick forest, and reported seeing Native American hunters and fishermen, numerous buffalo and deer, and heard the cries of coyotes.

Faced with severe weather toward the end of February, Logan stopped his river journey, pulling in roughly half a mile west of the present-day area of Hanover Beach. After a few days, he went ashore. Armed with a rifle, he climbed a nearby hill to the spot today known as Logan&#x27;s Point, after him. This was the first recorded instance of a European exploring the area of Hanover. Logan was so enamored with the view from this point that he decided to move there some day. He carved his initials and the date, March 1, 1801, on a beech tree. He did not return to settle for fourteen years.

===Dunn&#x27;s Settlement===
Judge Williamson Dunn, from Mercer County, Kentucky, purchased the land area of modern Hanover from the federal government on November 28, 1808. The following year, Dunn resettled his family to the area, which became known as a town as &quot;Dunn&#x27;s Settlement.&quot; This was later renamed as Hanover. A steady flow of settlers then followed, most of them Scots-Irish Presbyterians. They were immigrants and their children, mostly from northern Ireland, who had come to Virginia, then to Kentucky, and finally to the area of Hanover.

Among them was Christopher Harrison. He later was elected as Indiana&#x27;s first lieutenant governor and played a key role in planning the state capital of Indianapolis. Harrison built a homestead at Logan&#x27;s Point. When in 1815 Logan returned to the site, the two men met. Logan bought the land and settled permanently in Hanover, while Harrison moved to Salem, Indiana. The next year he was elected lieutenant governor.

Although many of the first residents were Presbyterian, for a time the only church in their area was in Charlestown, 25 miles to the west. In 1819, Presbyterian minister Thomas C. Searle (January 15, 1787 – October 15, 1821) moved to nearby Madison. He was a circuit preacher, serving the needs of the minority of Presbyterians in a wide area in southern Indiana, but he quickly realized that a community of Scotch-Irish Presbyterians was concentrated in Dunn&#x27;s Settlement. On March 4, 1820, Searle founded the Hanover Presbyterian Church. His wife, a native of Hanover, New Hampshire, was greatly admired by the church&#x27;s congregants; therefore, the church adopted the name in her honor. Before long, the town also adopted the name &quot;Hanover.&quot; Officially it was named &quot;South Hanover&quot; as there was already a post office of Hanover in Shelby County. When the other town of Hanover no longer had a post office, South Hanover&#x27;s name was shortened to Hanover.

Following the founding of the congregation, they organized to construct a church. Williamson Dunn donated land and funding for the cause. In October 1821, Searle died, and the minister&#x27;s post at the church was not filled until 1823.

===Founding of Hanover College===
John Finley Crowe was born in Greene County, Tennessee, growing up there and in Missouri, where his family migrated. He grew up in a Presbyterian household. After meeting some Presbyterian elders who had moved from North Carolina to his area in Missouri, Crowe became interested in pursuing a religious education. He attended Transylvania College in Lexington, Kentucky, and continued his education at Princeton Theological Seminary in Princeton, New Jersey. After completing his Masters of Divinity in 1815, Crowe accepted his first ministerial calling in Shelbyville, Kentucky. It was a slave state, but Crowe became actively involved in the abolitionist movement. He established a Sunday school for African-American children, but could not find a place where they were allowed to meet. On May 7, 1822, he began publication of the &quot;Abolition Intelligence and Missionary Magazine&quot;. Crowe&#x27;s abolitionist sympathies alienated him from his slave-holding neighbors, and he soon lost access to the printing press.
On April 2, 1823, John M. Dickey, moderator of a church session attended by Williamson Dunn and George Logan as elders, sent a letter to Crowe inviting him to serve at the Hanover Presbyterian Church. Disheartened by the hostility of neighbors in Kentucky, Crowe accepted the position, relieved to move to a free state. Soon after arriving in Hanover, Crowe began construction of his house. It still exists and is known today as the Crowe-Garritt House. Located just north of the present-day Hanover Presbyterian Church, the Crowe-Garritt House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

Soon after joining the Hanover Presbyterian Church, Crowe began encouraging members to sponsor the founding of a seminary. The religious academy opened in Hanover on January 1, 1827. Initially, classes met in the Presbyterian Church&#x27;s stone church building, which was located in the present-day area of the Hanover Firehouse. Within a year, however, the school had outgrown this location. Williamson Dunn donated land for the site of a new college building. In 1829, the state of Indiana granted a charter for Hanover Academy, essentially with a classical high school curriculum.

The Presbyterian Synod of Indiana recognized the theological segment of the school as the Indiana Seminary. Hanover Academy grew quickly over the ensuing years, adding to its programs. In 1833 it received a charter from the state of Indiana to form a four-year college under the name of Hanover College. But the seminary stagnated, and the two entities split in 1836. In 1841 the religious seminary moved to New Albany, Indiana. Faced with money problems and with students divided on the issue of slavery, in 1859 the seminary moved and reopened in Chicago, Illinois, as McCormick Theological Seminary. It was sponsored by a major business donor.

==Religion==

Although Hanover was largely founded by Presbyterians, people of other denominations soon also moved into the area. In the United States west of the Appalachian Mountains as a whole, Baptists and Methodists largely outnumbered Presbyterians during the early nineteenth century. Hanover Methodist Church was founded in 1846; the Hanover Baptist Church soon followed. The First Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) was founded in 1974.

St. Stephen&#x27;s African Methodist Episcopal Church, which belonged to the first independent Black denomination founded in the United States, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Hanover has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Hanover has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Madison is a city in and the county seat of Jefferson County, Indiana, United States, along the Ohio River. As of the 2010 United States Census its population was 11,967. Over 55,000 people live within of downtown Madison. Madison is the largest city along the Ohio River between Louisville and Cincinnati. In 2006, the majority of Madison&#x27;s downtown area was designated a National Historic Landmark—133 blocks of the downtown area is known as the Madison Historic Landmark District.

== History ==
Madison was laid out and platted in 1810, and the first lots were sold in 1811 by John Paul. It had busy early years due to heavy river traffic and its position as an entry point into the Indiana Territory along the historic Old Michigan Road. Madison&#x27;s location across the Ohio River from Kentucky, a slave state, made it an important location on the Underground Railroad, which worked to free fugitive slaves. George DeBaptiste&#x27;s barbershop in town became a nerve center of the local group. By 1850, Madison was the third-largest city in Indiana (after New Albany and Indianapolis), and among the 100 largest cities in the U.S.

Indiana&#x27;s first railroad, the Madison &amp; Indianapolis Railroad, was built there from 1836 to 1847. Chartered in 1832 by the Indiana State Legislature as the Madison Indianapolis &amp; Lafayette Railroad, and construction begun September 16, 1836, the railroad was transferred to private ownership on January 31, 1843, as the Madison &amp; Indianapolis Railroad. Successful for more than a decade, the railroad went into decline and was sold at foreclosure in 1862, renamed the Indianapolis &amp; Madison Railroad, and after a series of corporate transfers, became part of the massive Pennsylvania Railroad system in 1921. In March 1924, the Madison Area Chamber of Commerce was founded to aid area business growth and development. Conrail much later bought Pennsylvania Railroad, but the deal left out a stretch of track from North Vernon to Madison. Madison Port Authority purchased this, forming Madison Railroad in 1975.

Madison&#x27;s days as a leading Indiana city were numbered, however, when river traffic declined and new railroads built between Louisville, Indianapolis, and Cincinnati tapped into Madison&#x27;s trade network. As a result, Madison&#x27;s growth did not continue at the same pace it had experienced before the Civil War. During the late nineteenth century, many new buildings were still being built, but in many cases older structures were modernized by adding cast-iron storefronts and ornamental sheet metal cornices. Some earlier buildings survived without major alterations, and the Madison National Landmark Historic District today contains examples of all the major architectural styles of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, from Federal to Art Moderne.

In 1952 the town of North Madison was annexed, becoming a neighborhood of the city, which aided in providing city services to new businesses started in the area. A tornado in 1974 destroyed a number of buildings in the neighborhood.

On January 11, 1992, Shanda Sharer was murdered in the city by four teenage girls.

===National Register of Historic Places===
Downtown Madison was granted National Historic Landmark District status in early 2006. On August 25, 2006, just months after the designation, a blaze severely damaged two historic downtown buildings, the Madison Elks Lodge and a former city hall building that was occupied by an insurance company.

The Crawford-Whitehead-Ross House, Jefferson County Jail, Lanier Mansion, Madison Historic District, and Charles L. Shrewsbury House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Jefferson County Courthouse fire===

On May 20, 2009, the newly painted dome of the Jefferson County Courthouse caught fire. The blaze started around 6:15 pm. Smoke billowed hundreds of feet into the air and flames rose out of the clock tower. The fire continued to burn for hours. Fire officials reported that the fire was tentatively under control just before 9:45 pm. No major injuries were reported. The dome of the courthouse was being painted in celebration of Madison&#x27;s . On May 28, 2009, the ruined dome was removed from the top of the courthouse in two pieces. Authorities stated that the cause of the fire was a contractor using an open-flame propane torch to solder two pieces of copper together in one of the built-in gutters on the north side of the roof.

===Super Outbreak of tornadoes===
The 1974 Super Outbreak is the second-largest tornado outbreak on record for a single 24-hour period. From April 3 to April 4, 1974, there were 148 tornadoes confirmed in 13 states, including Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, and New York; and the Canadian province of Ontario. It extensively damaged approximately along a total combined path length of . The 1974 Super Outbreak remains the most outstanding severe convective weather episode of record in the continental United States. The outbreak far surpassed previous and succeeding events in severity, longevity and extent.

Shortly after an F-5 tornado struck Depauw, northwest of Louisville, the Hanover/Madison F4 twister formed near Henryville and traveled through Jefferson County, leveling many structures in the town of Hanover and in Madison. Eleven were killed in this storm, while an additional 300 were injured. According to WHAS-TV in Louisville, 90% of Hanover was destroyed or severely damaged, including the Hanover College campus. Despite the fact that no one was killed or seriously injured at the college, all but one of the college&#x27;s 33 buildings were damaged, including two that were completely destroyed and six that sustained major structural damage. Hundreds of trees were downed, completely blocking every campus road. All utilities were knocked out and communication with those off campus was nearly impossible. Damage to the campus alone was estimated at $10 million. In Madison, seven fatalities took place, and about 300 homes were destroyed; the tornado also brushed the community of China, causing additional fatalities.

The same storm would later strike the Cincinnati area, producing multiple tornadoes including another F5.

==Powerboat racing==

Madison has a powerboat racing tradition dating back to at least 1911. In 1929, the city began holding an annual race, later called the Madison Regatta beginning in 1948. Since 1954, the Madison Regatta has held a high points Unlimited hydroplane race annually in early July. Although Madison has a population of only 12,000, the regatta maintains its place in Unlimited Hydroplane racing, hosting an H1 Unlimited race, whose other events are in Seattle, San Diego, Guntersville, Alabama, and Tri-Cities, Washington. The Madison Regatta draws about 70,000–100,000 people annually on the July 4 weekend. A week-long riverfront festival also surrounds this racing event.

A source of community pride is that Madison has the world&#x27;s only community-owned unlimited hydroplane racer, &quot;Miss Madison&quot;, which began Unlimited-class racing in 1961. The boat, which has been known by various corporate sponsor names but was officially called U-6, traditionally finished near the bottom of the circuit. Before Anheuser-Busch dropped its sponsorship of hydroplane racing after the 2004 season, U-6 had won just six races using a variety of hulls. One of those wins was an upset in the 1971 Regatta, when by a mistake in the bidding process, the APBA Gold Cup was held in Madison for the first time, in which the low-budget team and its 1960-vintage hull defeated the well-funded corporate teams and their newer generation of &quot;Thunderboats&quot;. The Gold Cup winner retired at the end of the year, taking second place in the overall national standings, and was replaced with a new &quot;Miss Madison&quot; in 1972. Newer hulls followed in 1978 and 1988. Madison hosted the APBA Gold Cup Race again in 1979 and 1980.

As a participant in the new H1 Unlimited series, the City of Madison team driver, Steve David, finished first in the H1 Unlimited national point drivers standings in both 2005 and 2006 driving U-6, now in the colors of sponsor Oh Boy! Oberto. In 2008, under the aegis of Miss Madison Incorporated and with a new hull built in 2007, the U-1 &quot;Miss Madison&quot; won its first H1 Unlimited National High Points Championship for Oh Boy! Oberto. On July 3, 2011, at Madison, David escaped serious injury but the hull was seriously damaged when the three-time defending national champion crashed into the U-96 &quot;Spirit of Qatar&quot; on the third lap of the championship heat after &quot;Qatar&quot; spun in a turn into the path of the Oh Boy! Oberto/&quot;Miss Madison&quot;. David and the repaired boat returned in time for the 2011 Columbia Cup, where it finished second (to U-96), then won the August 7 Albert Lee Appliance Cup in Seattle. In true &quot;Miss Madison&quot; tradition, the repairs to the hull are being defrayed by local fundraisers.

The &quot;Miss Madison&quot;&#x27;s greatest accomplishment, when it seemingly came from out of nowhere to win the 1971 Gold Cup with an aged boat against powerful competitors such as &quot;Atlas Van Lines II&quot; and &quot;Miss Budweiser&quot;, was recreated in the semi-fictional film &quot;Madison&quot;.

In 2013, Miss Madison/ Oh Boy! Oberto driver Steve David announced his retirement after his final run at the San Diego Sea Fair. On Friday, November 8, 2013, a retirement celebration was held at the Boneyard Grill on Madison&#x27;s hilltop to celebrate David&#x27;s 12-year tenure as the driver of Miss Madison&#x27;s Oh Boy! Oberto.

The Madison-based team continues to compete in the H1 Unlimited championship, with driver Jimmy Shane and sponsor HomeStreet Bank, who have been with the squad since 2016.

==In popular culture==

Two Hollywood films have been shot in Madison. In the summer of 1957 Madison was selected as the location for &quot;Some Came Running&quot;, which brought actors Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Shirley MacLaine to town. The film was nominated for five Academy Awards. For &quot;Some Came Running&quot;, released in 1958, director Vincente Minnelli selected Madison to represent the fictional town of Parkman in filming the James Jones novel. On September 3, 1999, the community held an organized celebration to mark the 40th anniversary of the making of the film, which itself became the subject of a film documentary by Turner Classic Movies.

The city of Madison was both the subject and location for the film &quot;Madison&quot;, released in 2001. The filming brought notable stars such as Jim Caviezel, Bruce Dern, Paul Dooley, and Mary McCormack to town. &quot;Madison&quot; was released in 2001 and recounts the story of the city&#x27;s hosting and winning the penultimate hydroplane racing event of 1971, echoing the movie &quot;Hoosiers&quot;.

A Netflix Docuseries titled &quot;Girls Incarcerated&quot; was filmed there about the former Madison Juvenile Correction Facility.

<text>Vernon is a town within Vernon Township and the county seat of Jennings County, Indiana, United States. With a population of just 236 in the 2020 census, it is the smallest county seat in the state of Indiana, lying just south of the much larger North Vernon. It sits on a peninsula as it is nearly surrounded by the Muscatatuck River. Vernon is the only Indiana town with an elected mayor and an elected town marshal. , Wayne Zamora is the mayor and Britt Burgmeier is the marshal.

The Vernon Historic District is on the National Register of Historic Places and is the site of many firsts in the state.
* The first area set aside for use as a public playground in Indiana, The Commons
* The first elevated railroad overpass west of the Alleghenies
* The first all women&#x27;s jury in Indiana
* The first Disciples of Christ church in Indiana
It was also the home of Indiana&#x27;s fourth state park, now called Muscatatuck County Park.

==History==
Vernon was named after Mount Vernon, George Washington&#x27;s plantation estate in Virginia. The Vernon post office was established in 1817.

Vernon was the site of a near-battle on July 11, 1863, during Morgan&#x27;s Raid in the American Civil War. John Hunt Morgan, targeting the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad, demanded the surrender of the town, which was defended by 100 local militia in strong positions on hills and bluffs overlooking the Muscatatuck River and 178 Union troops under the command of Colonel Hugh Williams. The defenders successfully stalled Morgan by demanding time to consider surrender, and then requesting time for the evacuation of women and children, until 1,000 Union troops under the command of Brigadier General John Love could arrive from Seymour. Major General Lew Wallace also arrived later to take command of the entire Union force converging on Vernon. Morgan ultimately retreated south toward Dupont, Indiana, rather than risk a confrontation.

===Franklin Wonder Five===
The small town became nationally famous during the 1920s due to the outstanding athletic achievements of the local high school basketball team, who became known as the Franklin Wonder Five. A small group who had played together as boys, led by Fuzzy Vandivier and coached by Ernest &quot;Griz&quot; Wagner, they became the first high school team to win the state championship for three consecutive years (1920–22). The youths followed Wagner to the local Franklin College, where he became coach and they earned the title of national college champions in 1923. They turned down an offer to play against the top professional team, the New York Celtics.

===&quot;Life&quot; magazine feature===
The December 2, 1940 issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine included a photo essay by Bernard Hoffman entitled, &quot;A Small Town&#x27;s Saturday Night,&quot; depicting farmers Glen and Norris Dunn and family on a typical Saturday night in Franklin: Dad getting a hair cut, and the kids seeing a movie at the Artcraft, people at the drugstore, as well as photos of other social spots, such as Nick&#x27;s Candy Kitchen and the town&#x27;s &quot;lovers&#x27; lane.&quot; The nighttime photo showing double-parked cars and thick crowds on Jefferson Street is perhaps the best known of the set. According to the late-20th century critic James Guimond in his book on American photography, 
Since &quot;Life&quot; wanted a perfect Saturday night, and one they considered typical, the photographer did not select a town still blighted by the Depression... What &quot;Life&#x27;s&quot;&#x27; readers wanted, it seemed, was a stereotyped village that confirmed their nostalgic beliefs about small towns in which no one is bored, poor, or lonely; and the magazine&#x27;s photographers and editors - like Norman Rockwell in his &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; covers - gave them exactly that kind of town.

==Geography==
Franklin is located south of Indianapolis and north of Louisville, Kentucky, on I-65 and U.S. 31.

Their small floodplain has been adapted as the basis of Franklin&#x27;s green walkways and parks, which extend the entire length of the town. Hurricane Creek empties into Young&#x27;s Creek in Province Park, downtown, which flows into the Big Blue River farther South. A buried stream, Roaring Run, flows beneath Franklin. In the June 2008 Midwest floods, all of these streams overflowed, damaging or destroying more than 100 houses throughout Franklin, including some entire neighborhoods. Since 2008, The city of Franklin has bought many of the flood-damaged homes, and cleared them to make more green space, and expand the parks system. Province Park is home to a small family cemetery of the George King family, one of the original founding families of Franklin.

<text>Greenwood is a city in Johnson County, Indiana, United States. The population was 63,830 at the 2020 Census. Greenwood is located southeast of central Indianapolis between Interstate 65 and Interstate 69. It is the most populous suburban municipality in the southern portion of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Area.

==History==
The first inhabitants of the area currently known as Greenwood were the Delaware Indians (Lenape). In 1818, the Treaty of St. Mary&#x27;s opened central Indiana to European American settlement, and by 1823 the first cabin in northern Johnson County was erected by settlers John B. and Isaac Smock on land now occupied by Greenwood Park Mall. Greenwood was first known as &quot;Smocktown&quot; or &quot;Smock&#x27;s Settlement&quot; in honor of the Smock brothers, and became &quot;Greenfield&quot; in 1825. Since this clashed with another Greenfield located in Hancock County, the name of the settlement was changed to &quot;Greenwood&quot; in 1833.

Greenwood was incorporated as a town under Indiana law in 1864.

Greenwood was an early and key cog in the Electric Indianapolis Interurban Railway System. In 1895, Henry L. Smith proposed and organized the Indianapolis, Greenwood &amp; Franklin Company and graded the line to Greenwood. The Indianapolis, Greenwood &amp; Franklin Railway was opened between Indianapolis and Greenwood on January 1, 1900, and, according to Indianapolis historian Jacob Piatt Dunn, was the Hoosier capital&#x27;s first real interurban electric railway. The railway followed what is now Madison Avenue.

The J.T. Polk Canning Company was essential to Greenwood&#x27;s early growth. The cannery was a major employer and canned a variety of vegetables grown in Indiana. Later, the company expanded into the dairy market and provided milk delivery to customers. At one point the cannery was the largest canning operation west of Baltimore. The cannery was eventually purchased by the Stokely-Van Camp company and retained operations in Greenwood until the 1950s. Portions of the cannery are still standing on Main Street and have been repurposed for professional office space.

Greenwood became a fifth-class city in 1960.

In February 1965, an Indiana Civil Rights Commission report found that Greenwood had recently been one of 19 sundown towns in Indiana, where African Americans were not allowed to live or stay after dark. The city had been exclusively white since the 1920s. The report analyzes Greenwood&#x27;s housing problem within African American families in the few years leading up to 1965. The analysis confirms a study regarding poorly constructed homes on the outskirts of Greenwood and a purchased house bought by an African American family that sold below $15,000. Racial tensions rose when the family introduced themselves to their new neighbors. In response, the neighbors presented the African American family with hostile threats. In the aftermath, the owners revoked their sale from the housing market.

Greenwood has long been a rightward-leaning community politically. After the founding of the John Birch Society in Indianapolis in 1958, a landmark for many years on the south side, adjacent to U.S. Route 31, was a Society billboard demanding &quot;Get US out! of the United Nations&quot;.

Greenwood Commercial Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. This district encompasses 25 buildings and .

In 2010, the Greenwood City Council approved a measure to change the official status of Greenwood to a second-class city in accordance with Indiana Code Title 36, Article 4, Chapter 1.

On July 17, 2022, three people were killed and two others wounded after a mass shooting occurred at the food court of Greenwood Park Mall. The gunman was subsequently shot and killed by an armed civilian who witnessed the shooting.

==History==
Col. Avery M. Buckner is credited for platting a town, in the early 1850s, along a short-lived flat bar railroad that ran between Franklin, and Martinsville. First named Liberty, the name was changed to Trafalgar. Soon Ezekiel W. Morgan came to town to open a store. Denied a site near the railroad, he bought land in a nearby village founded by George Bridges.
In 1868, the railroad was rebuilt as the Fairland and Martinsville branch of the Big Four. The post office (and town name) was moved to Morgan&#x27;s store. By 1870, the “old” and “new” Trafalgars had grown together and were briefly incorporated as one. The current town of Trafalgar was reincorporated in 1946. By the 90s, the town had grown 266%. The name of the town commemorates the Battle of Trafalgar.

<text>Vincennes is a city in, and the county seat of, Knox County, Indiana, United States. It is located on the lower Wabash River in the southwestern part of the state, nearly halfway between Evansville and Terre Haute. It was founded in 1732 by French fur traders, including the namesake François-Marie Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes. It is the oldest continually inhabited European settlement in Indiana and was its longest serving territorial capital. It is one of the oldest settlements west of the Appalachians. The population was 16,759 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The vicinity of Vincennes was inhabited for thousands of years by different cultures of indigenous peoples. During the Late Woodland period, some of these peoples used local loess hills as burial sites; some of the more prominent examples are the Sugar Loaf Mound and the Pyramid Mound. In historic times, prominent local Indian groups who drove these people out were the Shawnee, Wabash, and the Miami tribe.

The first European settlers were French, when Vincennes was founded as part of the French colony of Illinois Country, New France. Later on, it would be transferred to the colony of Louisiana. Several years later, France lost the French and Indian War (part of the Seven Years&#x27; War), and as result ceded territory east of the Mississippi River, including Vincennes, to the victorious British.

Once the area was under British control, it was associated with the Province of Quebec until after the Revolutionary War. It then became part of the Illinois County of the Colony and Dominion of Virginia. Next it became part of Knox County in the Northwest Territory, and it was later included in the Indiana Territory. Vincennes served as capital of the Indiana Territory from 1800 until 1813, when the government was moved to Corydon.
===New France===
The first trading post on the Wabash River was established by Sieur Juchereau, Lieutenant General of Montréal. With thirty-four Canadiens, he founded the company post on October 28, 1702, to trade for Buffalo hides with American Indians. The exact location of Juchereau&#x27;s trading post is not known, but because the Buffalo Trace crosses the Wabash at Vincennes, many believe it was here. The post was a success; in the first two years, the traders collected over 13,000 buffalo hides. When Juchereau died, the post was abandoned. The French-Canadian settlers left what they considered hostile territory for Mobile (in present-day Alabama), then the capital of Louisiana.

The oldest European town in Indiana, Vincennes was officially established in 1732 as a second French fur trading post in this area. The French Indies Company commissioned a French officer, François-Marie Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes, to build a post along the Wabash River to discourage local nations from trading with the English. Vincennes founded the new trading post near the meeting points of the Wabash and White rivers, and the overland Buffalo Trace. Vincennes, who had lived with his father among the Miami tribe, persuaded the Piankeshaw to establish a village at his trading post. He also encouraged Canadien settlers to move there, and started his own family to increase the village population. Because the Wabash post was so remote, however, Vincennes had a hard time getting trade supplies from Louisiana for the native nations, who were also being courted by English traders. The boundary between the French colonies of Louisiana and Canada, although inexact in the first years of the settlement, was decreed in 1745 to run between Fort Ouiatenon (below the site of modern-day Lafayette, Indiana) and Vincennes.

In 1736, during the French war with the Chickasaw nation, Vincennes was captured and burned at the stake near the present-day town of Fulton, Mississippi. His settlement on the Wabash was renamed Poste Vincennes in his honor.

Louisiana governor Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, next appointed Louis Groston de Saint-Ange de Bellerive to command Poste Vincennes.

As the French colonists pushed north from Louisiana and south from Canada, however, the American colonists to the east continued to push west. In addition, British traders lured away many of Indians who had traded with the Canadiens. This competition escalated in the Ohio Country until 1754 and the eruption of the French and Indian War (the North American theater of the Seven Years&#x27; War between Britain and France.)

===British America===

On February 10, 1763, when New France was ceded to the British at the conclusion of the French and Indian War, Vincennes fell under the authority of Great Britain. British officer John Ramsey came to Vincennes in 1766. He took a census of the settlement, built up the fort, and renamed it Fort Sackville. The population grew quickly in the years that followed, resulting in a unique culture of interdependent Native Americans, Canadien settlers and British traders.

Vincennes was far from centers of British power. In 1770 and 1772, Thomas Gage, the commander in chief of Britain&#x27;s North American forces, received warnings that the residents of Vincennes were agitating against the Crown, and were inciting native tribes along the river trade routes to attack British traders. The Colonial Secretary, the Earl of Hillsborough, ordered the residents to be removed from Vincennes in response. Gage demurred while the residents responded to the charges against them, claiming to be &quot;peaceful settlers, cultivating the land which His Most Christian Majesty [meaning the King of France] granted us.&quot; The issue was resolved by Hillsborough&#x27;s successor, Lord Dartmouth, who insisted to Gage that the residents were not lawless vagabonds, but British subjects whose rights were protected by the Crown. Gage took no action against the residents of Vincennes. In 1778, residents at Poste Vincennes received word of the French alliance with the American Second Continental Congress from Father Pierre Gibault and Dr. Jean Laffont. They mobilized in support of the American revolutionaries, as did the local Piankeshaw, led by Chief Young Tobacco.

===Revolutionary War===
Lieutenant Colonel George R. Clark, Captain Leonard Helm, and others created a plan to capture the French forts that the British occupied after Louisiana was ceded. After Kaskaskia was captured by Clark, Lieutenant Governor Henry Hamilton sent British soldiers and reinforcements from Detroit to Fort Vincennes and helped to rebuild the fort.

The Italian merchant and Patriot Francis Vigo found Clark and informed the British presence at the fort. Vigo served with the Patriots, ordered war supplies from the Spanish to help, and acted as a secret agent for the Patriots. Clark rounded up enough men to outnumber the British and planned a surprise attack on Fort Vincennes in the heart of winter, a horrible time when no armies were expected to be able to attack due to illness, lack of food, and the flood waters that were high during this time. The Patriots won the Battle of Vincennes on February 23–24, 1779. Hamilton thought of Vincennes as &quot;a refuge for debtors and Vagabonds from Canada.&quot; George Rogers Clark recaptured Fort Sackville in the Battle of Vincennes without losing a single soldier.

===Post-Revolution turmoil===

Although the Americans remained in control of Vincennes, it took years to establish peace. In 1786, Captain John Hardin led a mounted Kentucky militia across the Ohio River and destroyed a friendly Piankeshaw town near Vincennes. This led to a series of attacks and counter-attacks between Wabash Indians and American settlers. Finally, on July 15, 1786, the Wabash landed in forty-seven war canoes at Vincennes to drive the Americans back to Kentucky. The Indians warned the Canadians in advance of their attack and assured them that they would not be harmed, but the Canadians warned the Americans. They quickly supplied Fort Patrick Henry and waited out the siege. One American was killed and four wounded, and the war party left after destroying the Americans&#x27; farms.

In response, Virginia governor Patrick Henry authorized George Rogers Clark to raise the Kentucky militia and mount an expedition against the warring tribes. General Clark gathered a force of 1,000 militia and departed Clarksville September 9, 1786, along the Buffalo Trace. The militia spent ten days in Vincennes before marching north along the Wabash, but men deserted by the hundreds. Clark was soon forced to return to Vincennes without any action taken. Clark left 150 men to help defend Vincennes, but this force soon turned into a lawless mob, and the citizens of Vincennes petitioned Congress for help. Secretary of War Henry Knox sent Colonel Josiah Harmar and the First American Regiment to restore order. The Kentucky militia fled Vincennes at the approach of U.S. Regulars.

Colonel Harmar left 100 regulars under Major Jean François Hamtramck and directed them to build a fort, Fort Knox. Vincennes remained an isolated town, difficult to supply due to its position deep within Indian territory. Secure transport to and from Vincennes meant travelling with a large, armed party, whether over land or via the Wabash River. On September 30, 1790, Major Hamtramck led 350 men from Vincennes as far north as the Vermillion River, to engage some of the Indian villages which had been at war with Vincennes. The Kickapoo tracked the party, however, and evacuated every village along the way before the Americans arrived. Hamtramck destroyed some abandoned villages, but he did not engage any war parties. Faced with desertions from Kentucky militia, Hamtramck returned to Vincennes. The expedition had done no serious harm to the enemies of Vincennes, but it distracted some of the Wabash villages while Josiah Harmar, now a General, led a much larger expedition up through Ohio country towards &quot;Kekionga&quot;.

===The Vincennes Tract===
The earliest land claims by inhabitants of Vincennes were based on a sale by the Indians to the French in 1742 of a tract of land containing 1.6 million acres, known as the Vincennes Tract. It was a rectangular block lying at right angles to the course of the Wabash River at Vincennes. The tract was ceded by France to Britain by treaty in 1763 after the French and Indian War. On October 18, 1775, an agent for the Wabash Company purchased two tracts of land along the Wabash River from the Piankeshaw tribe called the &#x27;Plankashaw Deed&#x27;. In these deeds, the Vincennes Tract was excepted, and it was the first recognition of the tract in period documents. Eventually, the United States Supreme Court invalidated the deeds.

The claims based on French sovereignty or individual deeds issued under it were eventually rejected by congress, because if there were such grants, they passed to the United States by the Treaty of Paris 1783.

By right of conquest, George Rogers Clark secured this land for the United States in 1779 and the Land Act of 1796 honored its boundaries.

The Vincennes Donation Lands were embodied in &quot;An Act for granting lands to the Inhabitants and settlers at Vincennes and the Illinois country, in the territory northwest of the Ohio, and for confirming them in their possessions (1791)&quot;.

===Growth===
By 1798, the population had reached 2,500. Vincennes was no longer considered a trading outpost, but a thriving city.

Elihu Stout published the first newspaper in the Indiana Territory in 1804 at Vincennes. The &quot;Indiana Gazette&quot; debuted on July 31, 1804. Fire destroyed the printing presses in 1806, but Stout revived the newspaper as the &quot;Western Sun&quot; in 1807.

Vincennes served as the first capital of Indiana Territory until it was moved to Corydon on May 1, 1813.

In 1826, &quot;A party of Shawnee Indians ... in men, women, and children, to 500, passed through this place [Vincennes] ... from their reservation at Wapaghkonetta, moving to the Mississippi. The celebrated Indian prophet, and a son of the great Tecumseh, were in the company.&quot;

===Slavery===

Slavery was practiced in the 16th century, when the present-day state of Indiana was part of New France (1534–1763), by the French and Native Americans. When the area became part of the Northwest Territory, slavery was banned by the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, but slavery and indentured servitude continued.
 Slaveholders created a &quot;loophole&quot;, that the provision did not apply to African Americans who were already enslaved in the state. In 1816, the Constitution of Indiana made forced labor illegal, stating that &quot;there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in this state.&quot;

Polly Strong, an enslaved woman of Vincennes, was the plaintiff in a case that argued that she should be free. After losing in the Harrison County Circuit Court, she won the case at the Indiana Supreme Court on July 22, 1820, and she was freed. In the case of 
Clark&#x27;s attorney appealed the decision with the Indiana Supreme Court in the case of &quot;Mary Clark v. G.W. Johnston&quot; was a former slave who was made an indentured servant and lived in Vincennes. She won her freedom on November 6, 1821, when the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that servitude violated the state&#x27;s 1816 Constitution. This was a landmark contract law case for indentured servants and foretold the end of in Indiana.

===Time zone controversy===
On November 4, 2007, Knox County joined Daviess, Martin, Pike, and Dubois counties in returning to the Eastern Time zone. Controversy concerning time in Indiana has caused a change in the time zone of Vincennes on three different occasions since the Standard Time Act of 1918.

<text>Warsaw is a city in and the county seat of Kosciusko County, Indiana, United States. Warsaw has a population of 15,804 as of the 2020 U.S. Census. Warsaw also borders a smaller town, Winona Lake.

==Etymology==
Warsaw, named after the capital of Poland in tribute to Tadeusz Kościuszko, was platted on October 21, 1836. Warsaw&#x27;s post office was established in 1837.

==History==
Early Warsaw saw traders, trappers, and merchants supplying manufactured goods to area farmers. Because of the central location in the lake region, tourists soon began visiting Warsaw and eventually made permanent residences in the city, with industry soon following.

In March 1854, Warsaw became a town, and the initial census on February 2, 1854, showed a total of 752 residents in the town limits. The Pennsylvania Railroad (then known as the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne, and Chicago Railroad) reached Warsaw in November 1854. The Big Four Railroad (Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago, and St Louis) arrived in Warsaw in August 1870.

Gas lights were installed in August 1880. Telephone lines were strung in 1882, with Dr. Eggleston having the first phone. The waterworks were constructed in 1885. Gas was supplemented with electricity in 1897, but gas was still used in many homes until 1915.

In 1895, Revra DePuy founded DePuy Manufacturing in Warsaw to make wire mesh and wooden splints, becoming the world&#x27;s first manufacturer of orthopedic appliances. In 1905, DePuy hired Justin Zimmer as a splint salesman. Zimmer broke away from DePuy in 1927 to start his own orthopedic company with Joe Ettinger in the basement of Ettinger. Warsaw is now known as the &quot;orthopaedic capital of the world.&quot;

The Warsaw-based East Fort Wayne Street Historic District, Kosciusko County Jail, Warsaw Courthouse Square Historic District, Warsaw Cut Glass Company, and Justin Zimmer House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>LaGrange is a town in and the county seat of LaGrange County, Indiana, United States. The population was 2,625 at the 2010 census.

==History==
LaGrange was laid out and platted in 1836. It took its name from LaGrange County.

LaGrange County&#x27;s initial settlers were Yankee immigrants, that is to say they were from New England and were descended from the English Puritans who settled that region in the colonial era. They were part of a wave of New England settlers moving west into what was then the Northwest Territory after the completion of the Erie Canal. The original settlers in LaGrange County specifically hailed from the Massachusetts counties of Worcester County, Suffolk County and Berkshire County; the Connecticut counties of Hartford County and Windham County as well as the Connecticut towns of Sherman, Lebanon and Fairfield; and from the Vermont towns of Burlington, Brookfield, Huntington and Grand Isle. They were mainly members of the Congregational Church, but as a result of the Second Great Awakening many became Baptists and many also converted to Pentecostalism and Methodism. When they arrived in what is now LaGrange County, there was nothing but virgin forest and wild prairie, the New England settlers cleared roads, built farms, constructed churches, erected government buildings, and established post routes. As a result of this migration, LaGrange County was culturally continuous with early New England culture for many years.

The LaGrange County Courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The courthouse and the annual fall festival are featured in the 1941 New Deal era post office mural painted by Jessie Hull Mayer. She won the federal commission to paint &quot;Corn School&quot; as part of the Section of Painting and Sculpture′s projects, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department.

<doc id="112410" wikidata="Q2252920" url="?curid=112410" title="Cedar Lake, Indiana">
<text>Cedar Lake is a town in Hanover and Center townships, Lake County, Indiana, United States. It is near the Illinois state line. Its population was 11,560 at the 2010 census. The town is notable for its location on Cedar Lake, the Lake of the Red Cedars museum. Cedar Lake is also bordered to Crown Point, Indiana.

==History==
Cedar Lake was settled by pioneers in the mid-19th century and was originally named West Point; the name “Cedar Lake” belonged to a nearby town that is now called Creston, Indiana. In 1839, the town that was then called West Point competed with the settlements of Liverpool and Lake Court House (later called Crown Point) to be the county seat of Lake County, but lost out to Liverpool. By 1870, the Cedar Lake Post Office was established, giving the area a new name. After the Monon Railroad came to the lake&#x27;s western shore in 1882, many new residents flocked to the area along with tourists who saw the lake as a resort destination. From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, Cedar Lake was a popular place for Chicagoans looking for a retreat from the city. The lake had over 50 hotels at the time and several pavilions and ballrooms that brought many well-known bands to entertain the visitors.

The Lassen Hotel and Monon Park Dancing Pavilion are listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Cedar Lake has a total area of , of which (or 85.54%) is land and (or 14.46%) is water. The lake, which is the largest natural lake in northwest Indiana, appears to have formed from glacial meltwaters. There is an abundance of hills around the lake, which are evidence of the Valparaiso Moraine running through the area.

The 781 acre lake is naturally fed by small streams, storm runoff, and a natural spring. The lake has a median depth of 8.8 feet. Its deepest depth at 16 feet located in the middle basin. The lack of clarity in the water is due to the low refresh rate of the water and the shallow depths combined with the size of the lake. The lake bed is composed mostly of a dirt and sand mixture, clay, and rocks.

<text>Crown Point is a city in and the county seat of Lake County, Indiana, United States. The population was 33,899 at the 2020 census. The city was incorporated in 1868. On October 31, 1834, Solon Robinson and his family became the first settlers to an area that later became Crown Point. Due to its location, Crown Point is known as the &quot;Hub of Lake County&quot;.

The city is surrounded by Merrillville to the north, Winfield to the east, Cedar Lake to the southwest, St. John to the west, and unincorporated Schererville to the northwest. The southern and southwestern parts of Crown Point border some unincorporated areas of Lake County.

==History==
On October 31, 1834, Solon Robinson and his family became the first settlers to stake a claim in the area that would eventually become Crown Point. In February 1837, Lake County was incorporated, with Liverpool, Indiana, as the county seat. Later that year, Solon Robinson funded a US$500 project to build a new wooden county courthouse in Crown Point, and the legislature was delighted to designate it as the county seat. It was not until 1868 that Crown Point was incorporated as a city.

In 1878, construction began on a new, larger county court house and clock tower. This new court house, now known as the &quot;Grand Old Lady&quot;, was built in the center of town and became the dominant feature of Crown Point (further additions to this courthouse would be made from 1907 to 1928). Campaigning for the presidency of the United States, William Jennings Bryan addressed a crowd from the steps of the courthouse in 1896. In 1897 a crowd of 4,000 gathered to watch a winning harness racing horse bred by noted Chicago theater manager Will J. Davis and his famous wife, contralto Jessie Bartlett Davis. The Davises bred trotters and dogs at their Crown Point farm c. 1885–1917. Crown Point was the site of the first Cobe Trophy automobile race, won by Louis Chevrolet in 1909.

The Old Lake County Courthouse was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, and the new Lake County Government Center opened on the north side of the city the next year.
Because Crown Point had no waiting period for marriage licenses, the city became a popular place for couples to marry; it became known as the &quot;Marriage Mill&quot;. Many famous people came to Crown Point to marry, including Tom Mix, Rudolph Valentino, Muhammad Ali, and Jackson 5 patriarch Joseph Jackson and their wives. Certain online sources claim that Ronald Reagan and Jane Wyman were married in Crown Point. But Reagan and Wyman were married in Glendale, California, according to sources such as Fox News, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

The Walter Allman House, Wellington A. Clark House, Crown Point Courthouse Square Historic District, Lake County Courthouse, Lake County Tuberculosis Sanatorium, Nurses Home and Superintendent&#x27;s House, Lake County Sheriff&#x27;s House and Jail, Albert Maack House, and William Whitaker Landscape and House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Locally designated residential historic districts include:

* Sunnyside Historic District, includes St. Mary&#x27;s Church and School and surrounding homes.
* Holley Historic District, includes 20 homes and one church, including former Sheriff Lillian Holley&#x27;s home at the southeast corner of South and East streets.

===Gangster era===
On March 3, 1934, FBI &quot;Public Enemy #1&quot; John Dillinger escaped from the &quot;escape-proof&quot; (as it was dubbed by local authorities at the time) Lake County Jail, which was guarded by many police and national guardsmen. Dillinger apparently escaped while brandishing a hand-carved wooden gun blackened with shoe polish, although this was disputed by some witnesses. Dillinger further embarrassed the city, as well as the 42-year-old female sheriff Lillian Holley, by driving off in her brand new V-8 Ford. The press augmented her chagrin with such headlines as: &quot;Slim woman, mother of twins, controlled Dillinger as sheriff.&quot; Incensed, Holley declared at the time, &quot;If I ever see John Dillinger again, I&#x27;ll shoot him dead with my own gun. Don&#x27;t blame anyone else for this escape. Blame me. I have no political career ahead of me and I don&#x27;t care.&quot; Furthermore, Holley made certain the Dillinger name would have no standing in Crown Point up until Holley&#x27;s death in 1994 at 102.

===&quot;Public Enemies&quot; (film)===
In March 2008, a Universal Studios team, under the direction of Michael Mann, visited Crown Point to film parts of the movie &quot;Public Enemies&quot; at the former county jail facility from which Dillinger escaped. The crime drama is set during The Great Depression with the focus on FBI agent Melvin Purvis&#x27; attempt to stop criminals John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and Pretty Boy Floyd. Christian Bale plays FBI agent Purvis, and Johnny Depp plays Dillinger. Actress Lili Taylor portrayed Sheriff Holley in the film. The shoot took three days to complete and involved a number of scenes inside the former Sheriff&#x27;s house and jail. A scene was constructed for filming the exterior. Depp was on the set for all three days and stayed late into the evenings each night to shake hands with hundreds of fans who stood for hours to see him and the film shoot. The movie was released in June 2009.

In 1830, the first permanent white settlers came to Northwest Indiana. The earliest historical records date back to 1838. On June 1, 1855, the original plat of the town was established. Aaron Norton Hart, a settler from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, played a key role in developing Dyer&#x27;s infrastructure in the 1860s and 1870s. Hart supervised construction of roads and the implementation of a drainage ditch system, allowing agricultural and commercial use of the marshy land. Hart was killed in 1883 while working on a ditch near Plum Creek. Hart Street, one of Dyer&#x27;s major north–south streets, bears his name. Hart&#x27;s wife, Martha Dyer Hart, is the town&#x27;s namesake.

Dyer was incorporated as a town under Indiana law on February 8, 1910. Upon incorporation, Dyer was divided into three wards: The first ward consisted of all land within town limits lying west of Hart Street; the second ward comprised the section east of Hart Street and south of Lincoln Highway; the land north of Lincoln Highway and east of Hart Street formed the third ward.

Meyer&#x27;s Castle was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

<text>East Chicago is a city in Lake County, Indiana, United States. The population was 26,370 at the 2020 census. Centered around heavy industry, the city is home to the Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal, an artificial freshwater harbor characterized by industrial and manufacturing activity. 

Situated along Lake Michigan, East Chicago is about from downtown Chicago and is just west of Gary, Indiana.

==History==
=== Founding and early settlement ===
The land that became East Chicago was originally swampland unsuitable for farming. The state of Indiana began selling off plots of land to railroads and speculators after 1851 to fund the local school system. Settlement of the area was very slow at first, and as late as the 1890s, the city had no proper streets or public utilities. East Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1893. The city was named from its location east of Chicago, Illinois.
=== Industrial growth ===
The 1900 census gives a total population of just 3,411, but the arrival of Inland Steel in 1903 transformed the city into an industrial powerhouse. The city&#x27;s population skyrocketed to over 24,000 by 1910, powered by immigration from all over Europe and the United States, and quickly became the most industrialized city in the United States, with over 80% of the city&#x27;s land zoned for heavy industry. Inland Steel dominated the city&#x27;s economy through the 1990s, and expanded its massive integrated mill at Indiana Harbor multiple times through the 1980s. From 60,000 tons of steel capacity in 1903, it expanded to 600,000 tons by 1914 and reached 1 million in 1917, and eventually peaked at 8.6 million tons in 1978. By 1907, East Chicago boasted a navigable waterway link to Lake Michigan and to the Grand Calumet River: the Indiana Harbor Ship Canal. Steel mills, petroleum refineries, construction firms, and chemical factories operated at Indiana Harbor and along its inner canal system.

Republic Steel, Youngstown Steel, LaSalle Steel, and U.S. Steel all eventually had steel-making operations in the city. During World War I, East Chicago was nicknamed the &quot;Arsenal of America&quot; (not to be confused with Detroit&#x27;s label as the &quot;Arsenal of Democracy&quot; during WWII) and the &quot;Workshop of America&quot;.

A rivalry developed between Indiana Harbor, the “East Side” home of Inland Steel and most working-class families, and East Chicago&#x27;s “West Side,” the residential enclave of the native-born business community. Locals spoke of the “Twin City” to describe spatial, residential, and class divisions at the heart of the town&#x27;s identity. The &quot;Twin City&quot; moniker remains to this day.

=== World War I to the present ===
During the 1910s, several thousand Mexicans immigrated to East Chicago to work in the mills during the labor shortage of 1917–1918 due to U.S. participation in World War I, and also acted as strike breakers during labor unrest in 1919. Most were single men who eventually hoped to return to Mexico, but many stayed on and eventually were joined by their families. The small Mexican community was targeted for voluntary and forced repatriation during the 1930s and 1950s (1,800 were deported in 1932 alone), but those who remained eventually paved the way for later Latino immigration after 1965.

Black Americans also began to arrive in the 1910s and 1920s as part of the first wave of the Great Migration, and this continued from the 1940s to 1960s. According to a city demographic survey in 1959, there were 1,000 Mexican families and 10,000 African American families, along with 3,000 Polish families. There were also a large number of families that identified as Puerto Rican, Romanian, Serbian, Italian, Lithuanian, and Croatian. Over 70 nationalities were represented, with over 59 congregations of the Protestants, Orthodox, Catholic Churches, as well as Jewish synagogues.

Like neighboring Gary, Indiana, East Chicago quickly developed a reputation as a rough industrial city, plagued by extreme pollution, ethnic and racial tensions, organized crime, illegal gambling and clubs, political corruption, prostitution, and other vices. The city continued to rapidly grow in the 1910s and 1920s, and the population peaked in 1960 at 57,669. However, East Chicago&#x27;s population began to decline in the 1960s as suburbanization, white flight, affordability of automobiles, and the construction of highways meant that workers no longer had to live in the city, but could commute from less-polluted suburbs.

It was the Steel crisis of the 1974-1986 period that completely devastated East Chicago, as it did other industrial cities like Gary, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and the south side of Chicago. East Chicago&#x27;s population plunged to 47,000 in 1970, 34,000 by 1990, and 29,000 by 2010. Employment at Inland Steel peaked at 25,000 in 1969, and successive layoffs over the next 30 years were devastating to the community; by 1998, only 9,000 were employed at Inland Steel. Inland Steel was acquired by Ispat International in 1998. Both the Indiana Harbor mill and Youngstown Steel mill were absorbed and merged by ArcelorMittal in 2004 and subsequently sold to Cleveland-Cliffs in 2020.

The Indiana Harbor Public Library and Marktown Historic District are listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

In 2009, parts of East Chicago were discovered to have toxic lead and arsenic contamination, designated the USS Lead Superfund Site. The site is divided into three zones, with public housing and residential properties. Residents&#x27; decades-long concerns about lead contamination were confirmed in 2016 via EPA testing, especially affecting over 270 families in the West Calumet Housing Complex. As governor of Indiana, Mike Pence declined to declare the Superfund site a state emergency; his successor Governor Eric Holcomb has issued Executive Order 17-13, declaring a disaster emergency in East Chicago.

==Transportation==
Gary/Chicago International Airport in Gary is Griffith&#x27;s nearest commercial airport.
*05C - Griffith-Merrillville Airport, (generally known locally simply as “Griffith Airport”) is a smaller airport within the boundaries of the Town of Griffith.

Cline Avenue runs through Griffith north to East Chicago. Interstate 65, The Borman Expressway, The Indiana Toll Road US 30 and US 41 are all short drives from Griffth.

The closest Amtrak station is in Dyer, while the closest South Shore Line station is in East Chicago.

Broad Street, the major north–south road through Griffith, used to be designated Indiana State Route 73. It was what has come to be called a &quot;feeder road,&quot; connecting US 6 at the north end to US 30 at the southern end, and at the southern end of the downtown area crossed over the six intersecting rail lines&#x27; 13 tracks, creating what was known for a time as the busiest railroad crossing in the country. SR 73 was the shortest state route in Indiana, and was the only Indiana state route to exist in only one town. Technically, a part of it straddled the border between St. John township and Schererville, but since the entire right of way did not reside in either, that part which did lie entirely within the borders of any designated area, were only in Griffith, and hence the appellation stuck. As the railroad traffic decreased and truck traffic increased US 30 was moved south to its present divided 4 lane route, and the old road became known as &quot;Old US 30,&quot; Joliet Road, and SR 330. Also, US 6 was removed from its route along Ridge Road at the northern terminus of SR 73 to the Borman Expressway. Its importance diminished and its major connections removed, the Indiana legislature felt that a road that lay entirely within a single town (or at least did not have a portion that sat entirely in another town), should not be provided state funding as its primary source of upkeep. As such, SR 73 was decommissioned as an Indiana state route on September 26, 1969.

<doc id="112415" wikidata="Q856860" url="?curid=112415" title="Hammond, Indiana">
<text>Hammond ( ) is a city in Lake County, Indiana, United States. Located along Lake Michigan, it is part of the Chicago metropolitan area and the only city in Indiana to border Chicago. As of the 2020 census, it is the eighth-most populous city in Indiana, with 77,879 residents. It was first settled in the mid-19th century and it is one of the oldest cities of northern Lake County.

From north to south, Hammond runs from Lake Michigan down to the Little Calumet River; from east to west along its southern border, it runs from the Illinois state line to Cline Avenue. The city is traversed by numerous railroads and expressways, including the South Shore Line, Borman Expressway, and Indiana Toll Road. Notable local landmarks include the parkland around Wolf Lake and the Horseshoe Hammond riverboat casino. Part of the Rust Belt, Hammond has been industrial almost from its inception but is also home to a campus of Purdue University and numerous historic districts.

==History==
The first European-descended residents arrived around 1847 to settle on land between the Grand and Little Calumet Rivers, on the south end of Lake Michigan. Those first residents of European descent were German immigrant farmers looking for land and opportunity. Before that time, the area was a crossroad for Indian tribes, explorers, stagecoach lines and supply lines to the West. Convenient location and abundant fresh water from Lake Michigan led to the beginning of Hammond&#x27;s industrialization in 1869 with the George H. Hammond Company meat-packing plant following merchants and farmers to the area. Hammond was incorporated on April 21, 1884, and was named after the Detroit butcher.

Hammond is one of the oldest cities in Lake County, with Crown Point being the oldest (established in 1834).
According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Chicago,&quot; George Henry Hammond, a pioneer in the use of refrigerated railcars for the transport of fresh meat, first used this method with his small packing company in Detroit, Michigan. In 1868, Hammond received a patent for a refrigerator car design. In the early 1870s, he built a new plant in northern Indiana along the tracks of the Michigan Central Railroad. By 1873, the George H. Hammond Co. was selling $1 million worth of meat a year; by 1875, sales were nearly $2 million. The company&#x27;s large packing house in Hammond rivaled those located at the Union Stock Yard in Chicago. By the middle of the 1880s, when it built a new plant in Omaha, Nebraska, Hammond was slaughtering over 100,000 cattle a year and owned a fleet of 800 refrigerator cars. After Hammond died in 1886, the company became less important and no longer challenged the giant Chicago packers, who acquired Hammond at the turn of the century and merged it into their National Packing Co.

The Hammond Whiting &amp; East Chicago Electric Railway Company trolley service ran from 1893 to 1940.

On June 22, 1918, the Hammond circus train wreck occurred about east of the city, killing 86 and injuring 127 persons.

The downtown Hammond shopping district along State Street and Hohman Avenue included major chains such as Sears and J. C. Penney. The largest stores in downtown were the Goldblatt&#x27;s and E.C. Minas department stores. The E.C. Minas store was constructed in 1894 and was in business until August 1984. The building which housed the Goldblatt&#x27;s store had been purchased by the Chicago-based retailer in 1931 and operated until 1982 when it closed due to bankruptcy.

The Pullman Standard Car Company built M4 Sherman tanks in Hammond during World War II.
Architect Victor Gruen designed the Woodmar Mall in the Woodmar neighborhood. The mall opened in 1954 and was anchored by a Carson Pirie Scott and Co. store.

According to the 1960 United States census Hammond&#x27;s population reached a record high of 111,698 residents. Hammond, like other industrial cities in the Rust Belt, went into decline during the 1970s and 1980s, with the city&#x27;s population plunging to 94,000 in 1980, and 83,000 in 2000. However, Hammond&#x27;s economy was more diversified than neighboring Gary, Indiana, East Chicago, Indiana, and the south side of Chicago, which all relied on heavy industry (primarily steel production). Hammond&#x27;s economy, on the other hand, depended on light manufacturing, transportation &amp; warehousing, retail, banking &amp; insurance, healthcare, hospitality &amp; food service, and construction. In 1981, a toxic flood in Gary led Hammond to erect a barrier on 165th Street, one of several roads connecting the two cities, which led to lasting tensions with Gary.

Prominent manufacturing companies in Hammond include Unilever&#x27;s soap factory, Atlas Tube, Cargill food processing, Munster Steel, Lear Seating Corporation, Jupiter Aluminum, Tri-State Automation, and Dover Chemical. Warehousing and storage is also prominent, with ExxonMobil and Marathon Petroleum having large oil storage facilities, and FedEx has a distribution center. Large railroad marshalling yards are also present in the city, with the Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad&#x27;s headquarters in the city. The State Line Generating Plant operated on the Indiana-Illinois state line from 1929 to 2012, and was demolished in 2014.

The Empress Casino opened in Hammond in June 1996 and was replaced with the Horseshoe Hammond casino in 2001.

In February 2006, the decision was made to demolish Woodmar Mall except for the Carson&#x27;s store. The Hammond Redevelopment Commission announced plans in June 2016 for a $12 million sports complex to be built on the site of the former mall. The Carson&#x27;s store closed in 2018, and was demolished in 2019, as part of its parent company&#x27;s liquidation.

==Geography==
The city sits within the boundaries of the former Lake Chicago, and much of its land area consists of former dune and swale terrain that was subsequently leveled. Most of the city is on sandy soil with a layer of black topsoil that varies from non-existent to several feet (a meter or more) thick. Much of the exposed sand was removed for purposes such as industrial use to make concrete and glass.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

**Hammond Ciesar All-Americans (1938–41) and Hammond Calumet Buccaneers (1948–49), were professional basketball teams in the National Basketball League. Baseball Hall of Famer Lou Boudreau and UCLA basketball coach John Wooden both played for the Ciesar All-Americans.

===The Hammond Pros (1920–1924)===
The Hammond Pros was one of the earliest professional football teams in the United States. When the American Professional Football Association was formed in 1920, the Hammond Pros was a charter member, as it also was when the league changed its name to National Football League in 1922. However, four years later, when the NFL decided to reduce the number of teams, it did so by simply folding smaller franchises. The Hammond Pros never played a home game in Hammond.

During the four years of the Hammond Pros&#x27; existence, the NFL had nine African-American players, six of whom played for the Pros. The NFL&#x27;s first African-American head coach was Hall-of-Famer coach Fritz Pollard of the Pros.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

Most of Hammond&#x27;s streets are laid out in a grid pattern similar to Chicago&#x27;s streets. While Madison Street in Chicago acts as the reference point for north–south street numbering the first &quot;1&quot; is removed; this makes what would be a five digit address number in Illinois into a four digit address number in Hammond. The state line is used as the reference point for east–west street numbering.

Other cities and towns in Northwest Indiana that use the Hammond numbering system are Whiting, Munster and Highland. Dyer also uses the Hammond numbering system but the first number removed from the north–south streets is a &quot;2,&quot; as by that point the Illinois numbers across the state line start with the number 2 (Munster&#x27;s street numbers start with a &quot;1&quot; north of the Dyer line, making them 5 digits); and East Chicago uses the canal located in the middle of the city as the east–west reference point, while embodying Hammond&#x27;s numbering system for the north–south streets.

All EasyGo buses were discontinued on June 30, 2012, due to a lack of funding. In addition, Pace routes 350 and 364 and GPTC Tri-City Connection Route 12 from Gary, Indiana stop at Hammond&#x27;s Dan Rabin Transit Plaza.

<doc id="112416" wikidata="Q932018" url="?curid=112416" title="Highland, Lake County, Indiana">
<text>Highland is a town in Lake County, Indiana, United States. The population was 23,984 at the 2020 census. The town was incorporated on April 4, 1910. It is a part of the Chicago metropolitan area and North Township, and is surrounded by Hammond to the north, Munster to the west, Schererville to the south and Griffith to the east.

== History ==
In 1847, two pioneers from Ohio, Michael and Judith Johnston, became Highland&#x27;s first settlers. The town slowly expanded until the early 1880s, when the development of Chicago &amp; Atlantic railroad trackage through the town attracted agriculture and manufacturing industries. Dutch settlers began moving to Highland shortly thereafter from nearby Munster. 304 people resided in Highland when it was incorporated in 1910. In 1992, the Indiana Historical Bureau placed a state historical marker at 8941 Kleinman Road () to recognize the immigration of Dutch in the Calumet Region.

In 1927, President Calvin Coolidge visited and delivered the dedication address for Wicker Memorial Park, located on the west side of the town. Highland, as with other towns along the Little Calumet River, has historically been subject to flooding, particularly during spring, and particularly in areas away from Ridge Road, which runs along the highest land in the town. Significant floods have affected Highland in 2008, 2007, and especially in September 2006.

On October 31, 2008, Barack Obama, who four days later would be elected the 44th President of the United States, stopped in Highland for a rally that drew 40,000 people to Wicker Park. It was the largest crowd there since President Coolidge dedicated the park in 1927.

The trail runs along the former right-of-way of the Erie-Lackawanna and Baltimore and Ohio railroads, and will eventually connect pedestrians to Chicago, Illinois, to the northwest and beyond Crown Point to the southeast by planned trail extensions. The trail also links Highland, by connections with other trails, with Porter County to the east.

It and the surrounding land are named Main Square Park after the now-defunct school that stood on the site until 1977. One of the other defunct schools, Lincoln Elementary, was converted into a community center in the early 1980s. The other, Orchard Park Elementary, closed in 1981 and was later purchased and reopened as a Calumet Baptist School in the early 1990s.

This area was historically an unincorporated section of Ross Township prior to a 1993 annexation by the city of Hobart and is served by the Merrillville post office.

<text>Lake Station is a city in Lake County, Indiana, United States. The population was 13,235 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Initially, the site of modern Lake Station was the starting point of two indigenous trails leading to Fort Dearborn. Later it became an early stagecoach depot stop, as the Fort Dearborn-Detroit Stagecoach Route passed through the site during the wet season. The location became known as Lake Station as far back as 1851 when it began to serve as a depot, the western terminus of the Michigan Central Railroad (on what would later become its Detroit to Chicago line). This was the first train station in Lake County. The Michigan Central Railroad built a park and railroad shops around its two-story depot. A year later, in April 1852, George Earle mapped out and platted a town of about on the site, continuing its name of Lake Station.

Being a bedroom community, Lake Station welcomed Abraham Lincoln to its Audubon Hotel, perhaps on more than one occasion, according to oral history. But George Pullman, who tried to negotiate for land in Lake Station for his proposed railcar company, never struck a deal and set up shop on the south side of Chicago instead. Prior to its current location in Crown Point, Indiana, the county seat was located on what is now the west end of Lake Station in a section called Liverpool, although it was a separate settlement at the time.

The name of Lake Station was officially changed to East Gary in 1908 in an attempt to lure executives from the nearby US Steel plant in Gary, Indiana into creating a suburban community. With another name change in 1977, primarily to disassociate itself from the urban decay and crime of Gary, the city reverted to its historical designation of Lake Station.

In September 2015, the mayor of Lake Station, Keith Soderquist, and his wife, Deborah Soderquist, were found guilty of conspiracy, wire fraud, and filing false income tax returns. Keith&#x27;s daughter, Miranda N. Brakley (married name Barnitt), a court clerk, was found guilty of embezzlement and filing bad bankruptcy papers. Under state law, a mayor convicted of a felony forfeits his elected office. The Soderquist&#x27;s served time in correctional institutions, while Ms. Brakley (Barnitt) served time in house arrest. The Soderquist&#x27;s and Barnitt are still residents of Lake Station, Indiana. 

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Lake Station has a total area of , of which (or 98.45%) is land and (or 1.55%) is water.

<text>Merrillville ( , ) is a town in Ross Township, Lake County, Indiana, United States. The population was 35,246 at the 2010 census. Merrillville is in east-central Lake County, in the Chicago metropolitan area. On January 1, 2015, Merrillville became the most populated town in Indiana, as Fishers in Hamilton County was converted from a town to a city. The town serves as a major shopping hub for Northwest Indiana.

==Geography==

According to the 2010 census, Merrillville has a total area of , of which (or 99.88%) is land and (or 0.12%) is water.

The town is centered on the intersection of U.S. Route 30 and Interstate 65.

The Lincoln Highway runs through Merrillville. The original alignment of Lincoln Highway is known as 73rd Avenue (also called Old Lincoln Highway) in Merrillville, while the current Lincoln Highway (US 30) is known as 81st Avenue. State Road 53 (Broadway) and State Road 55 (Taft Street) traverse the town from north to south.

Merrillville&#x27;s asymmetric shape results in numerous boundaries with other municipalities. It is bordered by Gary and unincorporated Calumet Township, Lake County, to the north; Hobart to the northeast; Union Township, Porter County, to the east; Winfield and Crown Point to the south; Schererville to the west; and Griffith to the northwest.
==History==
Merrillville occupies what used to be woodland belonging to the Potawatomi Indians. In 1834, a clearing was created for ceremonial purposes and called McGwinn Village. A year later, a white man, Jeremiah Wiggins, settled in the place; McGwinn Village became Wiggins Point.

Wiggins Point became a well-known stop for wagon trains heading to Joliet, Illinois along the Sauk Trail (also called the Sac Trail), an old Indian trail. At one time, 16 trails radiated outward from Wiggins Point. In 1838, Wiggins died. Sometime afterward, local settlers renamed the place Centerville. Later still, it was renamed Merrillville after the brothers Dudley and William Merrill. Dudley Merrill operated a hotel and store in Centerville, and his son John P. Merrill was a Township Trustee.

Nearby, in the same former Potawatomi hunting grounds, other settlements had sprung up. Near Deep River creek was a settlement named Deep River; near Turkey Creek was another settlement with that creek&#x27;s name. Others included Ainsworth, Lottaville, and Rexville. At one time, the post office for the area was named Lottaville.

In 1848, all of these settlements, including Merrillville (that is, the old McGwinn Village) were collected into one and called Ross Township. As time went by, bits and pieces of Ross Township were taken by Hobart and Crown Point when those towns incorporated.

In 1971, the area officially became Merrillville (which now includes the old Merrillville as well as other settlements nearby) and was incorporated as a town under Indiana law. During this time, the majority of the town&#x27;s growth was due to white flight from Gary.

In 1993, Merrillville tried to annex unincorporated Winfield Township to get more land. The residents blocked Merrillville by creating the town of Winfield.

In 2009, a pedestrian bridge at Hidden Lake Park collapsed, injuring at least 25 people The catastrophe occurred around 10 PM after the annual Fourth of July fireworks display, when several dozen people attempted to cross the wood suspension bridge. Police officers stationed at either side of the bridge were unable to stop the advancing parkgoers, and with numerous people jumping up and down the 30-year-old bridge collapsed, sending somewhere around 50 people into the waters of Hidden Lake.

The Morgan-Skinner-Boyd Homestead and John Wood Old Mill are listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

==Economy==
Merrillville is a hub for retail trade in Northwest Indiana. The US 30 corridor between Taft Street and Colorado Street harbors a large concentration of big-box retailers, hotels, restaurants, and automobile dealerships.

Ameriplex at the Crossroads, an industrial and technology park, opened at Broadway between 93rd Avenue and 101st Avenue in 2005. The development is designated an Indiana Certified Technology Park and includes a business incubator and technology center operated by the Purdue Research Foundation.

Heavy industry such as steelmaking and petroleum refining, which characterizes the economy of northern Lake County, does not have a significant presence in Merrillville. The town is home to the corporate headquarters of Fortune 500 energy company NiSource, hospitality management firm White Lodging, and Centier Bank, Indiana&#x27;s largest privately owned independent bank.

Merrillville&#x27;s nearest commercial airports are Griffith-Merrillville Airport in Griffith and Gary/Chicago International Airport in Gary.

<doc id="112423" wikidata="Q973519" url="?curid=112423" title="Munster, Indiana">
<text>Munster is a suburban town in North Township, Lake County, Indiana, United States. It is in the Chicago metropolitan area, approximately southeast of the Chicago Loop, and shares municipal boundaries with Hammond to the north, Highland to the east, Dyer and Schererville to the south, and Lansing and Lynwood directly west over the Illinois border. Its population was 23,894 at the 2020 US Census.

==Geography==
Munster is located at a point on an ancient shoreline of Lake Michigan (known as the Calumet Shoreline) which is today Ridge Road. This ridge runs east and west through the north part of town, hence the town&#x27;s nickname &quot;Town on the Ridge&quot;.

The town&#x27;s boundaries contain three small lakes, one of which, located within Centennial Park, is marshy and undeveloped. Munster is bordered on the north by the Little Calumet River, a shallow river surrounded by a thin strip of wooded area; and on the West by the Illinois state line.

According to the 2010 census, Munster has a total area of , of which (or 98.95%) is land and (or 1.05%) is water.

==History==
The Ibach House and Stallbohm Barn-Kaske House are listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

===Early history===
The earliest known inhabitants of the area were the Potawatomi. Although a village did not exist in what was to become Munster&#x27;s town boundaries, a trail along the dry sandy ridge now known as Ridge Road was well traveled by the indigenous inhabitants. Today, Munster&#x27;s downtown area, the Town Hall, Police and Fire Department headquarters, the Center for the Visual and Performing Arts, and the Munster Post Office are all situated on Ridge Road.

In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the area that is today Munster was part of land claimed by France as French territory. In the 1760s the British claimed the land where the Potawatomi lived as part of the British Empire. Twenty years later George Rogers Clark overran the British in the American Revolutionary War, claiming the land for the newly independent United States of America.

In the 1850s, as the numbers of Native Americans dwindled, pioneer settlers began to inhabit the area which would become Munster to grow crops and provide dairy products to the profitable markets in Chicago.

When Jacob Munster, a young man from the Netherlands who until the 1860s spelled his surname &quot;Monster,&quot; opened an area general store complete with a U.S. postal station on the back, the local farmers and settlers came to rely on the postal station, which soon became a United States Post Office. The post office was named Munster, as it was located in Jacob Munster&#x27;s general store.

Before long more and more people moved to the &quot;Munster&quot; area, and in 1907 Munster was incorporated as a town, with 76 residents voting &quot;yes&quot; for the incorporation and 28 voting &quot;no.&quot;

===Modern times===
Munster soon became a booming town that attracted many people. Munster saw difficult times through the rough years of the Great Depression. During the Cold War, Munster served as the site of the Nike-Zeus Missile defense base C-46. The site was closed in 1971 and is now under private ownership.

In September 2008, Munster&#x27;s northern portions suffered flooding resulting from the impact of Hurricane Ike, which caused the Little Calumet River to overflow. A main break occurred in the levee located near the intersection of Calumet Avenue and River Drive in the northwest quadrant of the town. Munster has requested the Army Corps of Engineers to elevate the levee in low-lying areas. The levee improvements have been completed and the majority of homes destroyed have been rebuilt, in most cases, with larger, more amenity-filled homes.

The 2010 Comprehensive Plan for Munster&#x27;s next twenty years includes plans for a new town center with shopping and dining to be organized around a proposed train station.

Munster is also home to the Three Floyds Brewing Company, a microbrewery and craft beer-drinker&#x27;s destination noted for its &quot;Dark Lord Day&quot; event, which draws 6,000 people every April.

===Lake Business Center===
In spring 2011, Simborg Development revitalized plans for a $60 million renovation of the 72-acre Lake Business Center site fronting Calumet Avenue that will open new commercial opportunities for the Town of Munster. This development, originally to be named Munster Town Center that would have created a mixed-use center of retail shops and restaurants, commercial offices, medical facilities as well as an extended-stay hotel, was modified to maintain the warehouse facility and maintain a high-tech image exterior for the development.

A Homewood Suites by Hilton hotel anchors the north end of the development.

===Centennial Village===
One of Munster&#x27;s newest redevelopment projects is the area immediately surrounding the former Munster Steel site, located to the north of the town&#x27;s Centennial Park. The area, named &quot;Centennial Village,&quot; will be a mixed-use transit-oriented development that will feature both retail and multi-unit residential housing once it is completed. The Calumet Avenue grade separation has been planned since the early 1940s, with Henry Ford leading the change. However, American involvement in World War II and the creation of the federal highway system stopped these plans until the present day.

The project will be completed in two phases; it is part of the larger 45th Avenue/Calumet Avenue underpass and realignment project in which Phase 1 includes extending 45th Avenue east into the Centennial Village development with two new stoplights and creating an underpass under the Canadian National railroad tracks to align with 45th at Columbia Avenue. Meanwhile, Phase 2 includes creating an underpass at Calumet Avenue. So far, Phase 1 has been completed.

==Transportation==
The commercial airport closest to Munster is the Gary/Chicago International Airport in Gary, but most Munster residents and visitors travel from Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare International Airport or the Chicago Midway International Airport. Lansing Municipal Airport, located immediately west of Munster in Lansing, Illinois, serves the area&#x27;s general aviation market.

Munster lies just south of the Borman Expressway (I-80/94). Calumet Avenue is a major North-South artery in the town, and becomes U.S. Route 41 just north of the Borman. Interstate 65, the Indiana Toll Road, and U.S. Routes 12, 20, and 30 are within a radius.

==Education==
The School Town of Munster is the public school system for all portions of the town. All five schools in the system are recognized as Indiana Blue Ribbon schools and have been awarded five-star ratings. Munster High School is one of several schools from Indiana on &quot;Newsweek&quot;&#x27;s 2006, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 Top Schools list. The school is also ranked on &quot;The Washington Post&quot;&#x27;s 2011 &quot;The High School Challenge&quot;. Additionally, Munster was cited by Neighborhood Scout for offering the best combination of public school quality and affordable neighborhoods in the Chicago Metropolitan Area.

In 1875, Munster&#x27;s school board (which at the time was not officially designated School Town) operated a single three-room school house located on the corner of Calumet Avenue and Ridge Road. According to local records, enrollment did not exceed 50 students in any given year before 1920. In 1913, the school board decided to add a second school building due to increased enrollment. The new Munster school was dedicated in 1915. By the 1940s, the building had expanded to include twelve classrooms, a new gymnasium, and a 60-seat basement auditorium. The school was renamed Lanier School in 1950.

These new additions were not enough to accommodate Munster&#x27;s rapidly growing population. By 1948, James B. Eads Elementary School was built on Harrison Avenue, for students residing west of Calumet Avenue. In 1952 Earnest R. Elliot Elementary School was built on White Oak Avenue. With the two new elementary schools in operation, Lanier School became a Junior High School (grades 7-9). Following graduation from grade 9, students attended high schools in either Hammond or Highland to complete grades 10-12.

A new, modern facility was planned for the junior high students in the late 1950s. Wilbur Wright Junior High opened in 1960, causing Lanier to downsize to an elementary school. Several classrooms and a resource center were added in the following years.
Amid the continuing expansion of the school system, the board gave serious consideration to adding a high school. The initial proposal encompassed a spacious building designed for 1,200 students and included an athletic facility with a swimming pool. However, the cost of more than $6.2 million did not appeal to the public. In response, a modified design was submitted, and construction began in June 1965. The doors to the new high school opened to students in September 1966.

In 1969, a new elementary school was added. Frank H. Hammond boasted 25 classrooms, an auditorium, and a learning center. When the outdated Lanier school&#x27;s enrollment dipped in the late 1970s, the board decided to close the facility in 1980.

===Modernization===
As of 2011, two of Munster&#x27;s three elementary schools have since been completely rebuilt; the new buildings for James B. Eads Elementary and Earnest R. Elliot Elementary were completed in 2003 and 2006, respectively. Wilbur Wright Middle School has undergone significant expansions and renovations as well. Munster High School dedicated a state-of-the-art football, track and soccer complex in 2010, as well as a $17,000,000 Aquatic Center in January 2011. The latter facility is one of two scholastic aquatic centers in Indiana and the only one that is connected to a high school (the other is IUPUI&#x27;s natatorium). In 2012, a two-story classroom addition was constructed at Munster High School to accommodate the growing student population.

The School Town of Munster implemented a curriculum/technology initiative termed &quot;1 to 1 Technology&quot; for the 2011-2012 school year. Designed to enhance the school system&#x27;s instructional technology infrastructure, the program provides leases on laptop computers to all students in grades 5-12. Initially focused on STEM fields curricula, the impact of the initiative is eventually expected to reach all subjects, and will better accommodate web-based student assessments.

===Private Schools===
Two private schools are located in Munster; St. Thomas More Parish added a school in 1949, available to and St. Paul&#x27;s Lutheran school is located at 8601 Harrison Ave, and was founded in Hammond in 1886. The church and school moved to Munster in 1981. Both schools are available to elementary and middle school students.

==Recreation==
Munster has ten parks, three lakes, a nine-hole golf course and driving range, eleven miles (17.7 km) of bike paths, an innovative public art and sculpture program, and two recreational points of interest. Centennial Park, the newest and largest of these facilities, was built on a former landfill and opened in 2007. This award-winning park incorporates several environmentally-friendly design elements conformant to the LEED Silver guidelines. Methane gas from the landfill is captured and converted into electricity to power the park.

Centennial Park&#x27;s amenities include a clubhouse with green roof and banquet facilities, &quot;The View&quot; restaurant with outdoor seating, a nine-hole (Tim Nugent of Nugent Golf in Vernon Hills, Illinois.) designed golf course and driving range, a live stage amphitheater, a lake with two bridges, three fountains, fishing opportunities, and a boardwalk, a sculpture walk (in progress), formal botanical gardens, outdoor pavilions, walking trails, access to the Pennsy Greenway, a 3-acre dog park, and soccer fields. Events held at Centennial Park include Munster Music Festival, Grape Escape Wine Festival, July 4 fireworks displays over the lake, and an outdoor movie series.

Community Park is another popular Munster park and hosts the town&#x27;s annual Car and Motorcycle Show. Features of this facility include an outdoor swimming complex, a skate park, lighted tennis courts, playgrounds, baseball fields, a basketball court, a social center, and picnic areas. The park is located immediately east of the Lake County Public Library&#x27;s Munster branch.

Little League Baseball was first organized in the town in 1952, and Babe Ruth Baseball was established in 1954. Munster&#x27;s Babe Ruth All-Star teams have won six state championships since 1985.

<text>Schererville ( , ) is a town in St. John Township, Lake County, Indiana, United States. The population was 29,646 at the 2020 census It is a suburb of Chicago, located 30 miles south of the city.

== History ==
Long before Indiana became a state, long before the founding of Schererville, people called the area the &quot;Crossroads,&quot; as several Native American trails intersected here, that later became routes for the wagons of settlers traveling west.

One of those settlers was Nicholas Scherer, who was born in 1830 at Scheuern, today part of Tholey, Saarland, in southwestern Germany, who arrived in the U.S. in 1846. When he came to this place at the southern tip of Lake Michigan in 1865, he founded the community that bears his name.
