<text>Space weather is a branch of space physics and aeronomy, or heliophysics, concerned with the varying conditions within the Solar System and its heliosphere. This includes the effects of the solar wind, especially on the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere, ionosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere. Though physically distinct, space weather is analogous to the terrestrial weather of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere (troposphere and stratosphere). The term &quot;space weather&quot; was first used in the 1950s and popularized in the 1990s. Later, it prompted research into &quot;space climate&quot;, the large-scale and long-term patterns of space weather.

==History==
For many centuries, the effects of space weather were noticed, but not understood. Displays of auroral light have long been observed at high latitudes.

=== Beginnings ===
In 1724, George Graham reported that the needle of a magnetic compass was regularly deflected from magnetic north over the course of each day. This effect was eventually attributed to overhead electric currents flowing in the ionosphere and magnetosphere by Balfour Stewart in 1882, and confirmed by Arthur Schuster in 1889 from analysis of magnetic observatory data.

In 1852, astronomer and British Major General Edward Sabine showed that the probability of the occurrence of geomagnetic storms on Earth was correlated with the number of sunspots, demonstrating a novel solar-terrestrial interaction. The solar storm of 1859 caused brilliant auroral displays and disrupted global telegraph operations. Richard Carrington correctly connected the storm with a solar flare that he had observed the day before near a large sunspot group, demonstrating that specific solar events could affect the Earth.

Kristian Birkeland explained the physics of aurorae by creating artificial ones in his laboratory, and predicted the solar wind.

The introduction of radio revealed that solar weather could cause extreme static or noise. Radar jamming during a large solar event in 1942 led to the discovery of solar radio bursts, radio waves over a broad frequency range created by a solar flare.

=== The 20th century ===
In the 20th century, the interest in space weather expanded as military and commercial systems came to depend on systems affected by space weather. Communications satellites are a vital part of global commerce. Weather satellite systems provide information about terrestrial weather. The signals from satellites of a global positioning system (GPS) are used in a wide variety of applications. Space weather phenomena can interfere with or damage these satellites or interfere with the radio signals with which they operate. Space weather phenomena can cause damaging surges in long-distance transmission lines and expose passengers and crew of aircraft travel to radiation, especially on polar routes.

The International Geophysical Year increased research into space weather. Ground-based data obtained during IGY demonstrated that the aurorae occurred in an &quot;auroral oval&quot;, a permanent region of luminescence 15 to 25° in latitude from the magnetic poles and 5 to 20° wide. In 1958, the Explorer I satellite discovered the Van Allen belts, regions of radiation particles trapped by the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. In January 1959, the Soviet satellite Luna 1 first directly observed the solar wind and measured its strength. A smaller International Heliophysical Year (IHY) occurred in 2007–2008.

In 1969,&quot; INJUN-5&quot; (or &quot;Explorer 40&quot;) made the first direct observation of the electric field impressed on the Earth&#x27;s high-latitude ionosphere by the solar wind. In the early 1970s, Triad data demonstrated that permanent electric currents flowed between the auroral oval and the magnetosphere.

The term &quot;space weather&quot; came into usage in the late 1950s as the space age began and satellites began to measure the space environment. The term regained popularity in the 1990s along with the belief that space&#x27;s impact on human systems demanded a more coordinated research and application framework.

== Programs ==
=== US National Space Weather Program ===

The purpose of the US National Space Weather Program is to focus research on the needs of the affected commercial and military communities, to connect the research and user communities, to create coordination between operational data centers, and to better define user community needs. NOAA operates the National Weather Service&#x27;s Space Weather Prediction Center.

The concept was turned into an action plan in 2000, an implementation plan in 2002, an assessment in 2006 and a revised strategic plan in 2010. A revised action plan was scheduled to be released in 2011 followed by a revised implementation plan in 2012.

=== ICAO Space Weather Advisory ===
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) implemented a Space Weather Advisory program in late 2019. Under this program, ICAO designated four global space weather service providers:
* The United States, which is done by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction Center.
* The Australia, Canada, France, and Japan (ACFJ) consortium, comprising space weather agencies from Australia, Canada, France, and Japan.
* The Pan-European Consortium for Aviation Space Weather User Services (PECASUS), comprising space weather agencies from Finland (lead), Belgium, the United Kingdom, Poland, Germany, Netherlands, Italy, Austria, and Cyprus.
* The China-Russian Federation Consortium (CRC) comprising space weather agencies from China and the Russian Federation.

==Phenomena==
Within the Solar System, space weather is influenced by the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field carried by the solar wind plasma. A variety of physical phenomena is associated with space weather, including geomagnetic storms and substorms, energization of the Van Allen radiation belts, ionospheric disturbances and scintillation of satellite-to-ground radio signals and long-range radar signals, aurorae, and geomagnetically induced currents at Earth&#x27;s surface. Coronal mass ejections are also important drivers of space weather, as they can compress the magnetosphere and trigger geomagnetic storms. Solar energetic particles (SEP) accelerated by coronal mass ejections or solar flares can trigger solar particle events, a critical driver of human impact space weather, as they can damage electronics onboard spacecraft (e.g. &quot;Galaxy 15&quot; failure), and threaten the lives of astronauts, as well as increase radiation hazards to high-altitude, high-latitude aviation.

==Effects==
===Spacecraft electronics===
Some spacecraft failures can be directly attributed to space weather; many more are thought to have a space weather component. For example, 46 of the 70 failures reported in 2003 occurred during the October 2003 geomagnetic storm. The two most common adverse space weather effects on spacecraft are radiation damage and spacecraft charging.

Radiation (high-energy particles) passes through the skin of the spacecraft and into the electronic components. In most cases, the radiation causes an erroneous signal or changes one bit in memory of a spacecraft&#x27;s electronics (single event upsets). In a few cases, the radiation destroys a section of the electronics (single-event latchup).

Spacecraft charging is the accumulation of an electrostatic charge on a nonconducting material on the spacecraft&#x27;s surface by low-energy particles. If enough charge is built up, a discharge (spark) occurs. This can cause an erroneous signal to be detected and acted on by the spacecraft computer. A recent study indicated that spacecraft charging is the predominant space weather effect on spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit.

===Spacecraft orbit changes===
The orbits of spacecraft in low Earth orbit (LEO) decay to lower and lower altitudes due to the resistance from the friction between the spacecraft&#x27;s surface (&quot;i.e. &quot;, drag) and the outer layer of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere (or the thermosphere and exosphere). Eventually, a LEO spacecraft falls out of orbit and towards the Earth&#x27;s surface. Many spacecraft launched in the past few decades have the ability to fire a small rocket to manage their orbits. The rocket can increase altitude to extend lifetime, to direct the re-entry towards a particular (marine) site, or route the satellite to avoid collision with other spacecraft. Such maneuvers require precise information about the orbit. A geomagnetic storm can cause an orbit change over a few days that otherwise would occur over a year or more. The geomagnetic storm adds heat to the thermosphere, causing the thermosphere to expand and rise, increasing the drag on spacecraft. The 2009 satellite collision between the &quot;Iridium 33&quot; and &quot;Cosmos 2251&quot; demonstrated the importance of having precise knowledge of all objects in orbit. &quot;Iridium 33&quot; had the capability to maneuver out of the path of &quot;Cosmos 2251 &quot;and could have evaded the crash, if a credible collision prediction had been available.

===Humans in space===
The exposure of a human body to ionizing radiation has the same harmful effects whether the source of the radiation is a medical X-ray machine, a nuclear power plant, or radiation in space. The degree of the harmful effect depends on the length of exposure and the radiation&#x27;s energy density. The ever-present radiation belts extend down to the altitude of crewed spacecraft such as the International Space Station (ISS) and the Space Shuttle, but the amount of exposure is within the acceptable lifetime exposure limit under normal conditions. During a major space weather event that includes an SEP burst, the flux can increase by orders of magnitude. Areas within ISS provide shielding that can keep the total dose within safe limits. For the Space Shuttle, such an event would have required immediate mission termination.

===Ground systems===
====Spacecraft signals====
The ionosphere bends radio waves in the same manner that water in a pool bends visible light. When the medium through which such waves travel is disturbed, the light image or radio information is distorted and can become unrecognizable. The degree of distortion (scintillation) of a radio wave by the ionosphere depends on the signal frequency. Radio signals in the VHF band (30 to 300 MHz) can be distorted beyond recognition by a disturbed ionosphere. Radio signals in the UHF band (300 MHz to 3 GHz) transit a disturbed ionosphere, but a receiver may not be able to keep locked to the carrier frequency. GPS uses signals at 1575.42 MHz (L1) and 1227.6 MHz (L2) that can be distorted by a disturbed ionosphere. Space weather events that corrupt GPS signals can significantly impact society. For example, the Wide Area Augmentation System operated by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is used as a navigation tool for North American commercial aviation. It is disabled by every major space weather event. Outages can range from minutes to days. Major space weather events can push the disturbed polar ionosphere 10° to 30° of latitude toward the equator and can cause large ionospheric gradients (changes in density over distance of hundreds of km) at mid and low latitude. Both of these factors can distort GPS signals.

===Long-distance radio signals===
Radio waves in the HF band (3 to 30 MHz) (also known as the shortwave band) are reflected by the ionosphere. Since the ground also reflects HF waves, a signal can be transmitted around the curvature of the Earth beyond the line of sight. During the 20th century, HF communications was the only method for a ship or aircraft far from land or a base station to communicate. The advent of systems such as Iridium brought other methods of communications, but HF remains critical for vessels that do not carry the newer equipment and as a critical backup system for others. Space weather events can create irregularities in the ionosphere that scatter HF signals instead of reflecting them, preventing HF communications. At auroral and polar latitudes, small space weather events that occur frequently disrupt HF communications. At mid-latitudes, HF communications are disrupted by solar radio bursts, by X-rays from solar flares (which enhance and disturb the ionospheric D-layer) and by TEC enhancements and irregularities during major geomagnetic storms.

Transpolar airline routes are particularly sensitive to space weather, in part because Federal Aviation Regulations require reliable communication over the entire flight. Diverting such a flight is estimated to cost about $100,000.

===Humans in commercial aviation ===
The magnetosphere guides cosmic ray and solar energetic particles to polar latitudes, while high-energy charged particles enter the mesosphere, stratosphere, and troposphere. These energetic particles at the top of the atmosphere shatter atmospheric atoms and molecules, creating harmful lower-energy particles that penetrate deep into the atmosphere and create measurable radiation. All aircraft flying above 8 km (26,200 feet) altitude are exposed to these particles. The dose exposure is greater in polar regions than at midlatitude and equatorial regions. Many commercial aircraft fly over the polar region. When a space weather event causes radiation exposure to exceed the safe level set by aviation authorities, the aircraft&#x27;s flight path is diverted.

Measurements of the radiation environment at commercial aircraft altitudes above 8 km (26,000 ft) have historically been done by instruments that record the data on board where the data are then processed later on the ground. However, a system of real-time radiation measurements on-board aircraft has been developed through the NASA Automated Radiation Measurements for Aerospace Safety (ARMAS) program. ARMAS has flown hundreds of flights since 2013, mostly on research aircraft, and sent the data to the ground through Iridium satellite links. The eventual goal of these types of measurements is to data assimilate them into physics-based global radiation models, e.g., NASA&#x27;s Nowcast of Atmospheric Ionizing Radiation System (NAIRAS), so as to provide the weather of the radiation environment rather than the climatology.

===Ground-induced electric fields===
Magnetic storm activity can induce geoelectric fields in the Earth&#x27;s conducting lithosphere. Corresponding voltage differentials can find their way into electric power grids through ground connections, driving uncontrolled electric currents that interfere with grid operation, damage transformers, trip protective relays, and sometimes cause blackouts. This complicated chain of causes and effects was demonstrated during the magnetic storm of March 1989, which caused the complete collapse of the Hydro-Québec electric-power grid in Canada, temporarily leaving nine million people without electricity. The possible occurrence of an even more intense storm led to operational standards intended to mitigate induction-hazard risks, while reinsurance companies commissioned revised risk assessments.

===Geophysical exploration===
Air- and ship-borne magnetic surveys can be affected by rapid magnetic field variations during geomagnetic storms. Such storms cause data-interpretation problems because the space weather-related magnetic field changes are similar in magnitude to those of the subsurface crustal magnetic field in the survey area. Accurate geomagnetic storm warnings, including an assessment of storm magnitude and duration, allows for an economic use of survey equipment.

===Geophysics and hydrocarbon production===
For economic and other reasons, oil and gas production often involves horizontal drilling of well paths many kilometers from a single wellhead. Accuracy requirements are strict, due to target size – reservoirs may only be a few tens to hundreds of meters across – and safety, because of the proximity of other boreholes. The most accurate gyroscopic method is expensive, since it can stop drilling for hours. An alternative is to use a magnetic survey, which enables measurement while drilling (MWD). Near real-time magnetic data can be used to correct drilling direction. Magnetic data and space weather forecasts can help to clarify unknown sources of drilling error.

===Terrestrial weather===
The amount of energy entering the troposphere and stratosphere from space weather phenomena is trivial compared to the solar insolation in the visible and infrared portions of the solar electromagnetic spectrum. Although some linkage between the 11-year sunspot cycle and the Earth&#x27;s climate has been claimed., this has never been verified. For example, the Maunder minimum, a 70-year period almost devoid of sunspots, has often been suggested to be correlated to a cooler climate, but these correlations have disappeared after deeper studies. The suggested link from changes in cosmic-ray flux causing changes in the amount of cloud formation did not survive scientific tests. Another suggestion, that variations in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) flux subtly influence existing drivers of the climate and tip the balance between El Niño/La Niña events collapsed when new research showed this was not possible. As such, a linkage between space weather and the climate has not been demonstrated.

In addition, a link has been suggested between high energy charged particles (such as SEPs and cosmic rays) and cloud formation. This is because charged particles interact with the atmosphere to produce volatiles which then condense, creating cloud seeds. This is a topic of ongoing research at CERN, where experiments test the effect of high-energy charged particles on atmosphere. If proven, this may suggest a link between space weather (in the form of solar particle events) and cloud formation.

Most recently, a statistical connection has been reported between the occurrence of heavy floods and the arrivals of high-speed solar wind streams (HSSs). The enhanced auroral energy deposition during HSSs is suggested as a mechanism for the generation of downward propagating atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs). As AGWs reach lower atmosphere, they may excite the conditional instability in the troposphere, thus leading to excessive rainfall. 

==Observation==

Observation of space weather is done both for scientific research and applications. Scientific observation has evolved with the state of knowledge, while application-related observation expanded with the ability to exploit such data.

===Ground-based===
Space weather is monitored at ground level by observing changes in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field over periods of seconds to days, by observing the surface of the Sun, and by observing radio noise created in the Sun&#x27;s atmosphere.

The Sunspot Number (SSN) is the number of sunspots on the Sun&#x27;s photosphere in visible light on the side of the Sun visible to an Earth observer. The number and total area of sunspots are related to the brightness of the Sun in the EUV and X-ray portions of the solar spectrum and to solar activity such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections.

The 10.7 cm radio flux (F10.7) is a measurement of RF emissions from the Sun and is roughly correlated with the solar EUV flux. Since this RF emission is easily obtained from the ground and EUV flux is not, this value has been measured and disseminated continuously since 1947. The world standard measurements are made by the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory at Penticton, BC, Canada and reported once a day at local noon in solar flux units (10−22W·m−2·Hz−1). F10.7 is archived by the National Geophysical Data Center.

Fundamental space weather monitoring data are provided by ground-based magnetometers and magnetic observatories. Magnetic storms were first discovered by ground-based measurement of occasional magnetic disturbance. Ground magnetometer data provide real-time situational awareness for postevent analysis. Magnetic observatories have been in continuous operations for decades to centuries, providing data to inform studies of long-term changes in space climatology.

Disturbance storm time index (Dst index) is an estimate of the magnetic field change at the Earth&#x27;s magnetic equator due to a ring of electric current at and just earthward of the geosynchronous orbit. The index is based on data from four ground-based magnetic observatories between 21° and 33° magnetic latitude during a one-hour period. Stations closer to the magnetic equator are not used due to ionospheric effects. The Dst index is compiled and archived by the World Data Center for Geomagnetism, Kyoto.

Kp/ap index: &#x27;a&#x27; is an index created from the geomagnetic disturbance at one midlatitude (40° to 50° latitude) geomagnetic observatory during a 3-hour period. &#x27;K&#x27; is the quasilogarithmic counterpart of the &#x27;a&#x27; index. Kp and ap are the average of K and an over 13 geomagnetic observatories to represent planetary-wide geomagnetic disturbances. The Kp/ap index indicates both geomagnetic storms and substorms (auroral disturbance). Kp/ap data are available from 1932 onward.

AE index is compiled from geomagnetic disturbances at 12 geomagnetic observatories in and near the auroral zones and is recorded at 1-minute intervals. The public AE index is available with a lag of two to three days that limits its utility for space weather applications. The AE index indicates the intensity of geomagnetic substorms except during a major geomagnetic storm when the auroral zones expand equatorward from the observatories.

Radio noise bursts are reported by the Radio Solar Telescope Network to the U.S. Air Force and to NOAA. The radio bursts are associated with solar flare plasma that interacts with the ambient solar atmosphere.

The Sun&#x27;s photosphere is observed continuously for activity that can be the precursors to solar flares and CMEs. The Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) project monitors both the surface and the interior of the Sun by using helioseismology, the study of sound waves propagating through the Sun and observed as ripples on the solar surface. GONG can detect sunspot groups on the far side of the Sun. This ability has recently been verified by visual observations from the &quot;STEREO&quot; spacecraft.

Neutron monitors on the ground indirectly monitor cosmic rays from the Sun and galactic sources. When cosmic rays interact with the atmosphere, atomic interactions occur that cause a shower of lower-energy particles to descend into the atmosphere and to ground level. The presence of cosmic rays in the near-Earth space environment can be detected by monitoring high-energy neutrons at ground level. Small fluxes of cosmic rays are present continuously. Large fluxes are produced by the Sun during events related to energetic solar flares.

Total Electron Content (TEC) is a measure of the ionosphere over a given location. TEC is the number of electrons in a column one meter square from the base of the ionosphere (around 90 km altitude) to the top of the ionosphere (around 1000 km altitude). Many TEC measurements are made by monitoring the two frequencies transmitted by GPS spacecraft. Presently, GPS TEC is monitored and distributed in real time from more than 360 stations maintained by agencies in many countries.

Geoeffectiveness is a measure of how strongly space weather magnetic fields, such as coronal mass ejections, couple with the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. This is determined by the direction of the magnetic field held within the plasma that originates from the Sun. New techniques measuring Faraday rotation in radio waves are in development to measure field direction.

===Satellite-based===
A host of research spacecraft have explored space weather. The Orbiting Geophysical Observatory series were among the first spacecraft with the mission of analyzing the space environment. Recent spacecraft include the NASA-ESA Solar-Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) pair of spacecraft launched in 2006 into solar orbit and the Van Allen Probes, launched in 2012 into a highly elliptical Earth orbit. The two STEREO spacecraft drift away from the Earth by about 22° per year, one leading and the other trailing the Earth in its orbit. Together they compile information about the solar surface and atmosphere in three dimensions. The Van Allen probes record detailed information about the radiation belts, geomagnetic storms, and the relationship between the two.

Some spacecraft with other primary missions have carried auxiliary instruments for solar observation. Among the earliest such spacecraft were the Applications Technology Satellite (ATS) series at GEO that were precursors to the modern Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) weather satellite and many communication satellites. The ATS spacecraft carried environmental particle sensors as auxiliary payloads and had their navigational magnetic field sensor used for sensing the environment.

Many of the early instruments were research spacecraft that were re-purposed for space weather applications. One of the first of these was the IMP-8 (Interplanetary Monitoring Platform). It orbited the Earth at 35 Earth radii and observed the solar wind for two-thirds of its 12-day orbits from 1973 to 2006. Since the solar wind carries disturbances that affect the magnetosphere and ionosphere, IMP-8 demonstrated the utility of continuous solar wind monitoring. IMP-8 was followed by ISEE-3, which was placed near the Sun-Earth Lagrangian point, 235 Earth radii above the surface (about 1.5 million km, or 924,000 miles) and continuously monitored the solar wind from 1978 to 1982. The next spacecraft to monitor the solar wind at the point was WIND from 1994 to 1998. After April 1998, the WIND spacecraft orbit was changed to circle the Earth and occasionally pass the point. The NASA Advanced Composition Explorer has monitored the solar wind at the point from 1997 to present.

In addition to monitoring the solar wind, monitoring the Sun is important to space weather. Because the solar EUV cannot be monitored from the ground, the joint NASA-ESA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft was launched and has provided solar EUV images beginning in 1995. SOHO is a main source of near-real time solar data for both research and space weather prediction and inspired the STEREO mission. The Yohkoh spacecraft at LEO observed the Sun from 1991 to 2001 in the X-ray portion of the solar spectrum and was useful for both research and space weather prediction. Data from Yohkoh inspired the Solar X-ray Imager on GOES.

Spacecraft with instruments whose primary purpose is to provide data for space weather predictions and applications include the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series of spacecraft, the POES series, the DMSP series, and the Meteosat series. The GOES spacecraft have carried an X-ray sensor (XRS) which measures the flux from the whole solar disk in two bands – 0.05 to 0.4 nm and 0.1 to 0.8 nm – since 1974, an X-ray imager (SXI) since 2004, a magnetometer which measures the distortions of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field due to space weather, a whole disk EUV sensor since 2004, and particle sensors (EPS/HEPAD) which measure ions and electrons in the energy range of 50 keV to 500 MeV. Starting sometime after 2015, the GOES-R generation of GOES spacecraft will replace the SXI with a solar EUV image (SUVI) similar to the one on SOHO and STEREO and the particle sensor will be augmented with a component to extend the energy range down to 30 eV.

The Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite is a NOAA Earth observation and space weather satellite that launched in February 2015. Among its features is advance warning of coronal mass ejections.

==Models==
Space weather models are simulations of the space weather environment. Models use sets of mathematical equations to describe physical processes.

These models take a limited data set and attempt to describe all or part of the space weather environment in or to predict how weather evolves over time. Early models were heuristic; i.e&quot;., &quot; they did not directly employ physics. These models take less resources than their more sophisticated descendants.

Later models use physics to account for as many phenomena as possible. No model can yet reliably predict the environment from the surface of the Sun to the bottom of the Earth&#x27;s ionosphere. Space weather models differ from meteorological models in that the amount of input is vastly smaller.

A significant portion of space weather model research and development in the past two decades has been done as part of the Geospace Environmental Model (GEM) program of the National Science Foundation. The two major modeling centers are the Center for Space Environment Modeling (CSEM) and the Center for Integrated Space weather Modeling (CISM). The Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center is a facility for coordinating the development and testing of research models, for improving and preparing models for use in space weather prediction and application.

Modeling techniques include (a) magnetohydrodynamics, in which the environment is treated as a fluid, (b) particle in cell, in which non-fluid interactions are handled within a cell and then cells are connected to describe the environment, (c) first principles, in which physical processes are in balance (or equilibrium) with one another, (d) semi-static modeling, in which a statistical or empirical relationship is described, or a combination of multiple methods.

== Commercial space weather development ==
During the first decade of the 21st Century, a commercial sector emerged that engaged in space weather, serving agency, academia, commercial and consumer sectors. Space weather providers are typically smaller companies, or small divisions within a larger company, that provide space weather data, models, derivative products and service distribution.

The commercial sector includes scientific and engineering researchers as well as users. Activities are primarily directed toward the impacts of space weather upon technology. These include, for example:

* Atmospheric drag on LEO satellites caused by energy inputs into the thermosphere from solar UV, FUV, Lyman-alpha, EUV, XUV, X-ray, and gamma ray photons as well as by charged particle precipitation and Joule heating at high latitudes; 
* Surface and internal charging from increased energetic particle fluxes, leading to effects such as discharges, single event upsets and latch-up, on LEO to GEO satellites; 
* Disrupted GPS signals caused by ionospheric scintillation leading to increased uncertainty in navigation systems such as aviation&#x27;s Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS);
* Lost HF, UHF and L-band radio communications due to ionosphere scintillation, solar flares and geomagnetic storms; 
* Increased radiation to human tissue and avionics from galactic cosmic rays SEP, especially during large solar flares, and possibly bremsstrahlung gamma-rays produced by precipitating radiation belt energetic electrons at altitudes above 8 km;
* Increased inaccuracy in surveying and oil/gas exploration that uses the Earth&#x27;s main magnetic field when it is disturbed by geomagnetic storms;
* Loss of power transmission from GIC surges in the electrical power grid and transformer shutdowns during large geomagnetic storms. 
Many of these disturbances result in societal impacts that account for a significant part of the national GDP.

The concept of incentivizing commercial space weather was first suggested by the idea of a Space Weather Economic Innovation Zone discussed by the American Commercial Space Weather Association (ACSWA) in 2015. The establishment of this economic innovation zone would encourage expanded economic activity developing applications to manage the risks space weather and would encourage broader research activities related to space weather by universities. It could encourage U.S. business investment in space weather services and products. It promoted the support of U.S. business innovation in space weather services and products by requiring U.S. government purchases of U.S. built commercial hardware, software, and associated products and services where no suitable government capability pre-exists. It also promoted U.S. built commercial hardware, software, and associated products and services sales to international partners. designate U.S. built commercial hardware, services, and products as “Space Weather Economic Innovation Zone” activities; Finally, it recommended that U.S. built commercial hardware, services, and products be tracked as Space Weather Economic Innovation Zone contributions within agency reports. In 2015 the U.S. Congress bill HR1561 provided groundwork where social and environmental impacts from a Space Weather Economic Innovation Zone could be far-reaching. In 2016, the Space Weather Research and Forecasting Act (S. 2817) was introduced to build on that legacy. Later, in 2017-2018 the HR3086 Bill took these concepts, included the breadth of material from parallel agency studies as part of the OSTP-sponsored Space Weather Action Program (SWAP), and with bicameral and bipartisan support the 116th Congress (2019) is considering passage of the Space Weather Coordination Act (S141, 115th Congress).

=== American Commercial Space Weather Association ===
On April 29, 2010, the commercial space weather community created the American Commercial Space Weather Association (ACSWA) an industry association. ACSWA promotes space weather risk mitigation for national infrastructure, economic strength and national security. It seeks to:

* provide quality space weather data and services to help mitigate risks to technology;
* provide advisory services to government agencies;
* provide guidance on the best task division between commercial providers and government agencies;
* represent the interests of commercial providers;
* represent commercial capabilities in the national and international arena; 
* develop best-practices.

A summary of the broad technical capabilities in space weather that are available from the association can be found on their web site http://www.acswa.us.

==Notable events==

<text>Aestivation ( (summer); also spelled estivation in American English) is a state of animal dormancy, similar to hibernation, although taking place in the summer rather than the winter. Aestivation is characterized by inactivity and a lowered metabolic rate, that is entered in response to high temperatures and arid conditions. It takes place during times of heat and dryness, which are often the summer months.

Invertebrate and vertebrate animals are known to enter this state to avoid damage from high temperatures and the risk of desiccation. Both terrestrial and aquatic animals undergo aestivation. Fossil records suggest that aestivation may have evolved several hundred million years ago.

==Physiology==

Organisms that aestivate appear to be in a fairly &quot;light&quot; state of dormancy, as their physiological state can be rapidly reversed, and the organism can quickly return to a normal state. A study done on &quot;Otala lactea&quot;, a snail native to parts of Europe and Northern Africa, shows that they can wake from their dormant state within ten minutes of being introduced to a wetter environment.

The primary physiological and biochemical concerns for an aestivating animal are to conserve energy, retain water in the body, ration the use of stored energy, handle the nitrogenous end products, and stabilize bodily organs, cells, and macromolecules. This can be quite a task as hot temperatures and arid conditions may last for months, in some cases for years. The depression of metabolic rate during aestivation causes a reduction in macromolecule synthesis and degradation. To stabilise the macromolecules, aestivators will enhance antioxidant defenses and elevate chaperone proteins. This is a widely used strategy across all forms of hypometabolism. These physiological and biochemical concerns appear to be the core elements of hypometabolism throughout the animal kingdom. In other words, animals which aestivate appear to go through nearly the same physiological processes as animals that hibernate.

==Invertebrates==

===Mollusca===
Gastropoda: some air-breathing land snails, including species in the genera &quot;Helix, Cernuella, Theba, Helicella, Achatina&quot; and &quot;Otala&quot;, commonly aestivate during periods of heat. Some species move into shaded vegetation or rubble. Others climb up tall plants, including crop species as well as bushes and trees, and will also climb human-made structures such as posts, fences, etc.

Their habit of climbing vegetation to aestivate has caused more than one introduced snail species to be declared an agricultural nuisance.

To seal the opening to their shell to prevent water loss, pulmonate land snails secrete a membrane of dried mucus called an epiphragm. In certain species, such as &quot;Helix pomatia&quot;, this barrier is reinforced with calcium carbonate, and thus it superficially resembles an operculum, except that it has a tiny hole to allow some oxygen exchange.

There is a decrease in metabolic rate and reduced rate of water loss in aestivating snails like &quot;Rhagada tescorum&quot;, &quot;Sphincterochila boissieri&quot; and others.

===Arthropoda===
Insecta: Lady beetles (Coccinellidae) have been reported to aestivate. Another type of beetle (&quot;Blepharida rhois)&quot; also chooses to aestivate. They usually do so when the temperature is warmer and will re-emerge in the late summer or early fall. Mosquitoes also are reported to undergo aestivation. False honey ants are well known for being winter active and aestivate in temperate climates. Bogong moths will aestivate over the summer to avoid the heat and lack of food sources. Adult alfalfa weevils (&quot;Hypera postica&quot;) aestivate during the summer in the southeastern United States, during which their metabolism, respiration, and nervous systems show a dampening of activity.

Crustacea: An example of a crustacean undergoing aestivation is with the Australian crab &quot;Austrothelphusa transversa,&quot; which undergoes aestivation underground during the dry season&quot;.&quot;

==Vertebrates==
===Reptiles and amphibians===

Non-mammalian animals that aestivate include North American desert tortoises, crocodiles, and salamanders. Some amphibians (e.g. the cane toad and greater siren) aestivate during the hot dry season by moving underground where it is cooler and more humid. The California red-legged frog may aestivate to conserve energy when its food and water supply is low.

The water-holding frog has an aestivation cycle. It buries itself in sandy ground in a secreted, water-tight mucus cocoon during periods of hot, dry weather. Australian Aboriginals discovered a means to take advantage of this by digging up one of these frogs and squeezing it, causing the frog to empty its bladder. This dilute urine—up to half a glassful—can be drunk. However, this will cause the death of the frog which will be unable to survive until the next rainy season without the water it had stored.

The western swamp turtle aestivates to survive hot summers in the ephemeral swamps it lives in. It buries itself in various media which change depending on location and available substrates. Because the species is critically endangered, the Perth Zoo began a conservation and breeding program for it. However, zookeepers were unaware of the importance of their aestivation cycle and during the first summer period would perform weekly checks on the animals. This repeated disturbance was detrimental to the health of the animals, with many losing significant weight and some dying. The zookeepers quickly changed their procedures and now leave their captive turtles undisturbed during their aestivation period. 

===Fish===
African lungfish also aestivate as can salamanderfish.

===Mammals===
Although relatively uncommon, a small number of mammals aestivate. Animal physiologist Kathrin Dausmann of Philipps University of Marburg, Germany, and coworkers presented evidence in a 2004 edition of &quot;Nature&quot; that the Malagasy fat-tailed dwarf lemur hibernates or aestivates in a small tree hole for seven months of the year. According to the Oakland Zoo in California, four-toed hedgehogs are thought to aestivate during the dry season.

<doc id="113500" wikidata="Q36484" url="?curid=113500" title="Conjunction (grammar)">
<text>In grammar, a conjunction (abbreviated or ) is a part of speech that connects words, phrases, or clauses&quot;,&quot; which are called its conjuncts. That description is vague enough to overlap with those of other parts of speech because what constitutes a &quot;conjunction&quot; must be defined for each language. In English, a given word may have several senses and in some contexts be a preposition but a conjunction in others, depending on the syntax. For example, &quot;after&quot; is a preposition in &quot;he left after the fight&quot; but a conjunction in &quot;he left after they fought&quot;. 

In general, a conjunction is an invariant (non-inflecting) grammatical particle that stands between conjuncts. A conjunction may be placed at the beginning of a sentence, but some superstition about the practice persists. The definition may be extended to idiomatic phrases that behave as a unit and perform the same function, &quot;as well as&quot;, &quot;provided that&quot;.

A simple literary example of a conjunction is &quot;the truth of nature, &quot;and&quot; the power of giving interest&quot; (Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Biographia Literaria&quot;).

==Separation of clauses==
Commas are often used to separate clauses. In English, a comma is used to separate a dependent clause from the independent clause if the dependent clause comes first: &quot;After I fed the cat, I brushed my clothes.&quot; (Compare this with &quot;I brushed my clothes after I fed the cat.&quot;) A relative clause takes commas if it is non-restrictive, as in &quot;I cut down all the trees, which were over six feet tall.&quot; (Without the comma, this would mean that only the trees more than six feet tall were cut down.) Some style guides prescribe that two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (&quot;for&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;nor&quot;, &quot;but&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, &quot;yet&quot;, &quot;so&quot;) must be separated by a comma placed before the conjunction. In the following sentences, where the second clause is independent (because it can stand alone as a sentence), the comma is considered by those guides to be necessary:
* &quot;Mary walked to the party, but she was unable to walk home.&quot;
* &quot;Designer clothes are silly, and I can&#x27;t afford them anyway.&quot;
* &quot;Don&#x27;t push that button, or twelve tons of high explosives will go off right under our feet!&quot;
In the following sentences, where the second half of the sentence is not an independent clause (because it does not contain an explicit subject), those guides prescribe that the comma be omitted:
* &quot;Mary walked to the party but was unable to walk home.&quot;
* &quot;I think designer clothes are silly and can&#x27;t afford them anyway.&quot;
However, such guides permit the comma to be omitted if the second independent clause is very short, typically when the second independent clause is an imperative, as in:
* &quot;Sit down and shut up.&quot;
The above guidance is not universally accepted or applied. Long coordinate clauses are nonetheless usually separated by commas:
* &quot;She had very little to live on, but she would never have dreamed of taking what was not hers.&quot;

A comma between clauses may change the connotation, reducing or eliminating ambiguity. In the following examples, the thing in the first sentence that is very relaxing is the cool day, whereas in the second sentence it is the walk, since the introduction of commas makes &quot;on a cool day&quot; parenthetical:

:&quot;They took a walk on a cool day that was very relaxing.&quot;

:&quot;They took a walk, on a cool day, that was very relaxing.&quot;

If another prepositional phrase is introduced, ambiguity increases, but when commas separate each clause and phrase, the restrictive clause can remain a modifier of &quot;the walk&quot;:

:&quot;They took a walk in the park on a cool day that was very relaxing.&quot;

:&quot;They took a walk, in the park, on a cool day, that was very relaxing.&quot;

In some languages, such as German and Polish, stricter rules apply on comma use between clauses, with dependent clauses always being set off with commas, and commas being generally proscribed before certain coordinating conjunctions.

The joining of two independent sentences with a comma and no conjunction (as in &quot;It is nearly half past five, we cannot reach town before dark.&quot;) is known as a &quot;comma splice&quot; and is sometimes considered an error in English; in most cases a semicolon should be used instead. A comma splice should not be confused, though, with the literary device called &quot;asyndeton&quot;, in which coordinating conjunctions are purposely omitted for a specific stylistic effect.
==Etymology==
Beginning in the 17th century, an element of a conjunction was known as a &quot;conjunct&quot;. A conjunction itself was then called a &quot;connective&quot;. That archaic term, however, diminished in usage during the early 20th century. In its place, the terms &quot;coordinating conjunction&quot; (coined in the mid-19th century) and &quot;correlative conjunction&quot; (coined in the early 19th century) became more commonly used.

==Coordinating conjunctions==
Coordinating conjunctions, also called coordinators, are conjunctions that join, or coordinate, two or more items (such as words, main clauses, or sentences) of equal syntactic importance. In English, the mnemonic acronym &quot;FANBOYS&quot; can be used to remember the most commonly used coordinators: &quot;for&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;nor&quot;, &quot;but&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, &quot;yet&quot;, and &quot;so&quot;. These are not the only coordinating conjunctions; various others are used, including: &quot;and nor&quot; (British), &quot;but nor&quot; (British), &quot;neither&quot; (&quot;They don&#x27;t gamble, neither do they smoke&quot;), &quot;no more&quot; (&quot;They don&#x27;t gamble, no more do they smoke&quot;), and &quot;only&quot; (&quot;I would go, only I don&#x27;t have time&quot;). Types of coordinating conjunctions include cumulative conjunctions, adversative conjunctions, alternative conjunctions, and illative conjunctions.

Here are some examples of coordinating conjunctions in English and what they do:

*For – an &quot;illative&quot; (i.e. inferential), presents rationale (&quot;They do not gamble or smoke, for they are ascetics.&quot;)
*And – a &quot;cumulative&quot;, adds non-contrasting items or ideas (&quot;They gamble, and they smoke.&quot;)
*Nor – presents an &quot;alternative&quot; non-contrasting (also negative) idea (&quot;They do not gamble, nor do they smoke.&quot;)
*But – an &quot;adversative&quot;, presents a contrast or exception (&quot;They gamble, but they don&#x27;t smoke.&quot;)
*Or – presents an &quot;alternative&quot; non-contrasting item or idea (&quot;Every day they gamble, or they smoke.&quot;)
*Yet – an &quot;adversative&quot;, presents a strong contrast or exception (&quot;They gamble, yet they don&#x27;t smoke.&quot;)
*So – an &quot;illative&quot; (i.e. inferential), presents a consequence (&quot;He gambled well last night, so he smoked a cigar to celebrate.&quot;)

Only &quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, &quot;nor&quot; are actual coordinating logical operators connecting atomic propositions or syntactic multiple units of the same type (subject, objects, predicative, attributive expressions, etc.) within a sentence. The cause and consequence (illative) conjunctions are pseudo-coordinators, being expressible as antecedent or consequent to logical implications or grammatically as subordinate conditional clauses.

== Correlative conjunctions ==
Correlative conjunctions are conjunctions within a syntax that aggregates or contrasts correlated actions, characteristics, or items in the manner of:

1. The use of whether paired with or, as well as if paired with then as conditional conjunctions, e.g. -
:* &quot;Vegetables are nutritious whether you love them or you hate them.&quot;
:* &quot;If you can&#x27;t afford it, then don&#x27;t buy it.&quot;

2. A nominal phrase headed by a &quot;negating determiner&quot; paired with an ensuing nominal phrase headed by nor, e.g., &quot;The suites convey &quot;neither&quot; corporate coldness nor warmth.&quot;

3. An &quot;adjective&quot; (or &quot;adjectival phrase&quot;) or an &quot;adverb&quot; (or an &quot;adverbial phrase&quot;) paired with an ensuing conjunction, e.g. -
:* &quot;Successes that are &quot;as&quot; scattered as they are rare.&quot;
:* &quot;He ran &quot;both&quot; far and fast.&quot;
:* &quot;She&#x27;s &quot;either&quot; a singer or an actress.&quot;
:* &quot;A puppy that&#x27;s &quot;not only&quot; cute but also smart.&quot;
:* &quot;&quot;Neither&quot; the caller’s name nor the number was visible.&quot;
:* &quot;&quot;Just as&quot; we left, so we also decided never to return.&quot;
:* &quot;There are &quot;as many&quot; dogs as there are cats.&quot;
:* &quot;&quot;No sooner&quot; had we received the call than we left the house.&quot;
:* &quot;I&#x27;d &quot;rather&quot; flee than fight.&quot;
:* &quot;It&#x27;s &quot;not&quot; a frog but rather a tadpole.&quot;

== Conjunctions of time ==

Examples:
== Subordinating conjunctions ==
Subordinating conjunctions, also called subordinators, are conjunctions that introduce content, relative, and adverbial clauses as subordinate ones, and join them to other clauses, whether independent or dependent. The most common subordinating conjunctions in English include &quot;after&quot;, &quot;although&quot;, &quot;as&quot;, &quot;as far as&quot;, &quot;as if&quot;, &quot;as long as&quot;, &quot;as soon as&quot;, &quot;as though&quot;, &quot;because&quot;, &quot;before&quot;, &quot;even if&quot;, &quot;even though&quot;, &quot;every time&quot;, &quot;if&quot;, &quot;in order that&quot;, &quot;since&quot;, &quot;so&quot;, &quot;so that&quot;, &quot;than&quot;, &quot;that&quot;, &quot;though&quot;, &quot;unless&quot;, &quot;until&quot;, &quot;when&quot;, &quot;whenever&quot;, &quot;where&quot;, &quot;whereas&quot;, &quot;wherever&quot;, and &quot;while&quot;. 
A complementizer is subordinating conjunction that introduces a content clause (that is, a clause that is a complement of the verb phrase, instead of the more typical nominal subject or object): e.g. &quot;I wonder &quot;whether&quot; he&#x27;ll be late. I hope &quot;that&quot; he&#x27;ll be on time&quot;. Some subordinating conjunctions, when used to introduce a phrase instead of a full clause, become prepositions with identical meanings. Relativizers are subordinators that introduce relative clauses.

The subordinating conjunction performs two important functions within a sentence: marking the higher rank of the independent clause and transiting between the two clauses’ ideas by indicating the nexus of time, place, or cause. Subordinators therefore structure the relationship between the clauses.

In many verb-final languages, subordinate clauses must precede the main clause on which they depend. The equivalents to the subordinating conjunctions of non-verb-final languages such as English are either
* clause-final conjunctions (e.g. in Japanese); or
* suffixes attached to the verb, and not separate words

Such languages often lack conjunctions as a part of speech, because:

* the form of the verb used is formally nominalised and cannot occur in an independent clause
* the clause-final conjunction or suffix attached to the verb is a marker of case and is also used in nouns to indicate certain functions. In this sense, the subordinate clauses of these languages have much in common with postpositional phrases.

In other West Germanic languages like German and Dutch, the word order after a subordinating conjunction is different from that in an independent clause, e.g. in Dutch (&#x27;for&#x27;) is coordinating, but (&#x27;because&#x27;) is subordinating. The clause after the coordinating conjunction has normal word order, but the clause after the subordinating conjunction has verb-final word order. Compare:

: . (&#x27;He goes home, for he is ill.&#x27;)
: (&#x27;He goes home, because he is ill.&#x27;)

Similarly, in German, (&#x27;for&#x27;) is coordinating, but (&#x27;because&#x27;) is subordinating:
: (&#x27;He goes home, for he is ill.&#x27;)
: (&#x27;He goes home, because he is ill.&#x27;)

== Starting a sentence ==

It is now generally agreed that a sentence may begin with a coordinating conjunction like &quot;and&quot;, &quot;but,&quot; or &quot;yet&quot;. While some people consider this usage improper, &quot;Follett&#x27;s Modern American Usage&quot; labels its prohibition a &quot;supposed rule without foundation&quot; and a &quot;prejudice [that] lingers from a bygone time.&quot;

Some associate this belief with their early school days. One conjecture is that it results from young children&#x27;s being taught to avoid simple sentences starting with &quot;and&quot; and are encouraged to use more complex structures with subordinating conjunctions. In the words of Bryan A. Garner, the &quot;widespread belief ... that it is an error to begin a sentence with a conjunction such as &quot;and&quot;, &quot;but&quot;, or &quot;so&quot; has no historical or grammatical foundation&quot;, and good writers have frequently started sentences with conjunctions.

There is also a misleading guideline that a sentence should never begin with &quot;because&quot;. &quot;Because&quot; is a subordinating conjunction and introduces a dependent clause. It may start a sentence when the main clause follows the dependent clause.

===Examples===
* &quot;And now we have Facebook and Twitter and Wordpress and Tumblr and all those other platforms that take our daily doings and transform them into media.&quot;
* &quot;So any modern editor who is not paranoid is a fool&quot;.
* &quot;And strikes are protected globally, existing in many of the countries with labour laws outside the Wagner Act model.&quot;

<text>In digital signal processing, spatial anti-aliasing is a technique for minimizing the distortion artifacts (aliasing) when representing a high-resolution image at a lower resolution. Anti-aliasing is used in digital photography, computer graphics, digital audio, and many other applications.

Anti-aliasing means removing signal components that have a higher frequency than is able to be properly resolved by the recording (or sampling) device. This removal is done before (re)sampling at a lower resolution. When sampling is performed without removing this part of the signal, it causes undesirable artifacts such as black-and-white noise.

In signal acquisition and audio, anti-aliasing is often done using an analog anti-aliasing filter to remove the out-of-band component of the input signal prior to sampling with an analog-to-digital converter. In digital photography, optical anti-aliasing filters made of birefringent materials smooth the signal in the spatial optical domain. The anti-aliasing filter essentially blurs the image slightly in order to reduce the resolution to or below that achievable by the digital sensor (the larger the pixel pitch, the lower the achievable resolution at the sensor level).

==Examples==
In computer graphics, anti-aliasing improves the appearance of &quot;jagged&quot; polygon edges, or &quot;jaggies&quot;, so they are smoothed out on the screen. However, it incurs a performance cost for the graphics card and uses more video memory. The level of anti-aliasing determines how smooth polygon edges are (and how much video memory it consumes).

Near the top of an image with a receding checker-board pattern, the image is both difficult to recognise and not aesthetically appealing. In contrast, when anti-aliased the checker-board near the top blends into grey, which is usually the desired effect when the resolution is insufficient to show the detail. Even near the bottom of the image, the edges appear much smoother in the anti-aliased image. Multiple methods exist, including the sinc filter, which is considered a better anti-aliasing algorithm. When magnified, it can be seen how anti-aliasing interpolates the brightness of the pixels at the boundaries to produce grey pixels since the space is occupied by both black and white tiles. These help make the sinc filter antialiased image appear much smoother than the original.

In a simple diamond image, anti-aliasing blends the boundary pixels; this reduces the aesthetically jarring effect of the sharp, step-like boundaries that appear in the aliased graphic.

Anti-aliasing is often applied in rendering text on a computer screen, to suggest smooth contours that better emulate the appearance of text produced by conventional ink-and-paper printing. Particularly with fonts displayed on typical LCD screens, it is common to use subpixel rendering techniques like ClearType. Sub-pixel rendering requires special colour-balanced anti-aliasing filters to turn what would be severe colour distortion into barely-noticeable colour fringes. Equivalent results can be had by making individual sub-pixels addressable as if they were full pixels, and supplying a hardware-based anti-aliasing filter as is done in the OLPC XO-1 laptop&#x27;s display controller. Pixel geometry affects all of this, whether the anti-aliasing and sub-pixel addressing are done in software or hardware.

==Simplest approach to anti-aliasing==
The most basic approach to anti-aliasing a pixel is determining what percentage of the pixel is occupied by a given region in the vector graphic - in this case a pixel-sized square, possibly transposed over several pixels - and using that percentage as the colour.

A very basic plot of a single, white-on-black anti-aliased point using that method can be done as follows:
def plot_antialiased_point(x: float, y: float):
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Plot a single, white-on-black anti-aliased point.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 for rounded_x in floor(x) to ceil(x):
 for rounded_y in floor(y) to ceil(y):
 percent_x = 1 - abs(x - rounded_x)
 percent_y = 1 - abs(y - rounded_y)
 percent = percent_x * percent_y
 draw_pixel(coordinates=(rounded_x, rounded_y), color=percent (range 0-1))
This method is generally best suited for simple graphics, such as basic lines or curves, and applications that would otherwise have to convert absolute coordinates to pixel-constrained coordinates, such as 3D graphics. It is a fairly fast function, but it is relatively low-quality, and gets slower as the complexity of the shape increases. For purposes requiring very high-quality graphics or very complex vector shapes, this will probably not be the best approach.

Note: The codice_1 routine above cannot blindly set the colour value to the percent calculated. It must add the new value to the existing value at that location up to a maximum of 1. Otherwise, the brightness of each pixel will be equal to the darkest value calculated in time for that location which produces a very bad result. For example, if one point sets a brightness level of 0.90 for a given pixel and another point calculated later barely touches that pixel and has a brightness of 0.05, the final value set for that pixel should be 0.95, not 0.05.

For more sophisticated shapes, the algorithm may be generalized as rendering the shape to a pixel grid with higher resolution than the target display surface (usually a multiple that is a power of 2 to reduce distortion), then using bicubic interpolation to determine the average intensity of each real pixel on the display surface.

==Signal processing approach to anti-aliasing==
In this approach, the ideal image is regarded as a &quot;signal&quot;. The image displayed on the screen is taken as samples, at each (&quot;x,y&quot;) pixel position, of a filtered version of the signal. Ideally, one would understand how the human brain would process the original signal, and provide an on-screen image that will yield the most similar response by the brain.

The most widely accepted analytic tool for such problems is the Fourier transform; this decomposes a signal into basis functions of different frequencies, known as frequency components, and gives us the amplitude of each frequency component in the signal. The waves are of the form:

:formula_1

where &quot;j&quot; and &quot;k&quot; are arbitrary non-negative integers. There are also frequency components involving the sine functions in one or both dimensions, but for the purpose of this discussion, the cosine will suffice.

The numbers &quot;j&quot; and &quot;k&quot; together are the &quot;frequency&quot; of the component: &quot;j&quot; is the frequency in the &quot;x&quot; direction, and &quot;k&quot; is the frequency in the &quot;y&quot; direction.

The goal of an anti-aliasing filter is to greatly reduce frequencies above a certain limit, known as the Nyquist frequency, so that the signal will be accurately represented by its samples, or nearly so, in accordance with the sampling theorem; there are many different choices of detailed algorithm, with different filter transfer functions. Current knowledge of human visual perception is not sufficient, in general, to say what approach will look best.

==Two dimensional considerations==

The previous discussion assumes that the rectangular mesh sampling is the dominant part of the problem. The filter usually considered optimal is not rotationally symmetrical, as shown in this first figure; this is because the data is sampled on a square lattice, not using a continuous image. This sampling pattern is the justification for doing signal processing along each axis, as it is traditionally done on one dimensional data. Lanczos resampling is based on convolution of the data with a discrete representation of the sinc function.

If the resolution is not limited by the rectangular sampling rate of either the source or target image, then one should ideally use rotationally symmetrical filter or interpolation functions, as though the data were a two dimensional function of continuous x and y. The sinc function of the radius has too long a tail to make a good filter (it is not even square-integrable). A more appropriate analog to the one-dimensional sinc is the two-dimensional Airy disc amplitude, the 2D Fourier transform of a circular region in 2D frequency space, as opposed to a square region.
One might consider a Gaussian plus enough of its second derivative to flatten the top (in the frequency domain) or sharpen it up (in the spatial domain), as shown. Functions based on the Gaussian function are natural choices, because convolution with a Gaussian gives another Gaussian whether applied to x and y or to the radius. Similarly to wavelets, another of its properties is that it is halfway between being localized in the configuration (x and y) and in the spectral (j and k) representation. As an interpolation function, a Gaussian alone seems too spread out to preserve the maximum possible detail, and thus the second derivative is added.

As an example, when printing a photographic negative with plentiful processing capability and on a printer with a hexagonal pattern, there is no reason to use sinc function interpolation. Such interpolation would treat diagonal lines differently from horizontal and vertical lines, which is like a weak form of aliasing.

==Practical real-time anti-aliasing approximations==

There are only a handful of primitives used at the lowest level in a real-time rendering engine (either software or hardware accelerated). These include &quot;points&quot;, &quot;lines&quot; and &quot;triangles&quot;. If one is to draw such a primitive in white against a black background, it is possible to design such a primitive to have fuzzy edges, achieving some sort of anti-aliasing. However, this approach has difficulty dealing with adjacent primitives (such as triangles that share an edge).

To approximate the uniform averaging algorithm, one may use an extra buffer for sub-pixel data. The initial (and least memory-hungry) approach used 16 extra bits per pixel, in a 4 × 4 grid. If one renders the primitives in a careful order, such as front-to-back, it is possible to create a reasonable image.

Since this requires that the primitives be in some order, and hence interacts poorly with an application programming interface such as OpenGL, the latest methods simply have two or more full sub-pixels per pixel, including full color information for each sub-pixel. Some information may be shared between the sub-pixels (such as the Z-buffer.)

===Mipmapping===
There is also an approach specialised for texture mapping called mipmapping, which works by creating lower resolution, pre-filtered versions of the texture map. When rendering the image, the appropriate-resolution mipmap is chosen and hence the texture pixels (texels) are already filtered when they arrive on the screen. Mipmapping is generally combined with various forms of texture filtering in order to improve the final result.

==Example of an image with extreme pseudo-random aliasing==
Because fractals have unlimited detail and no noise other than arithmetic round-off error, they illustrate aliasing more clearly than do photographs or other measured data. The escape times, which are converted to colours at the exact centres of the pixels, go to infinity at the border of the set, so colours from centres near borders are unpredictable, due to aliasing. This example has edges in about half of its pixels, so it shows much aliasing. The first image is uploaded at its original sampling rate. (Since most modern software anti-aliases, one may have to download the full-size version to see all of the aliasing.) The second image is calculated at five times the sampling rate and down-sampled with anti-aliasing. Assuming that one would really like something like the average colour over each pixel, this one is getting closer. It is clearly more orderly than the first.

In order to properly compare these images, viewing them at full-scale is necessary.
It happens that, in this case, there is additional information that can be used. By re-calculating with a &quot;distance estimator&quot; algorithm, points were identified that are very close to the edge of the set, so that unusually fine detail is aliased in from the rapidly changing escape times near the edge of the set. The colours derived from these calculated points have been identified as unusually unrepresentative of their pixels. The set changes more rapidly there, so a single point sample is less representative of the whole pixel. Those points were replaced, in the third image, by interpolating the points around them. This reduces the noisiness of the image but has the side effect of brightening the colours. So this image is not exactly the same that would be obtained with an even larger set of calculated points. To show what was discarded, the rejected points, blended into a grey background, are shown in the fourth image.

Finally, &quot;Budding Turbines&quot; is so regular that systematic (Moiré) aliasing can clearly be seen near the main &quot;turbine axis&quot; when it is downsized by taking the nearest pixel. The aliasing in the first image appears random because it comes from all levels of detail, below the pixel size. When the lower level aliasing is suppressed, to make the third image and then that is down-sampled once more, without anti-aliasing, to make the fifth image, the order on the scale of the third image appears as systematic aliasing in the fifth image.

Pure down-sampling of an image has the following effect (viewing at full-scale is recommended):

==Super sampling / full-scene anti-aliasing==

Super sampling anti-aliasing (SSAA), also called full-scene anti-aliasing (FSAA), is used to avoid aliasing (or &quot;jaggies&quot;) on full-screen images. SSAA was the first type of anti-aliasing available with early video cards. But due to its tremendous computational cost and the advent of multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) support on GPUs, it is no longer widely used in real time applications. MSAA provides somewhat lower graphic quality, but also tremendous savings in computational power.

The resulting image of SSAA may seem softer, and should also appear more realistic. However, while useful for photo-like images, a simple anti-aliasing approach (such as super-sampling and then averaging) may actually worsen the appearance of some types of line art or diagrams (making the image appear fuzzy), especially where most lines are horizontal or vertical. In these cases, a prior grid-fitting step may be useful (see hinting).

In general, super-sampling is a technique of collecting data points at a greater resolution (usually by a power of two) than the final data resolution. These data points are then combined (down-sampled) to the desired resolution, often just by a simple average. The combined data points have less visible aliasing artifacts (or moiré patterns).

Full-scene anti-aliasing by super-sampling usually means that each full frame is rendered at double (2x) or quadruple (4x) the display resolution, and then down-sampled to match the display resolution. Thus, a 2x FSAA would render 4 super-sampled pixels for each single pixel of each frame. Rendering at larger resolutions will produce better results; however, more processor power is needed, which can degrade performance and frame rate. Sometimes FSAA is implemented in hardware in such a way that a graphical application is unaware the images are being super-sampled and then down-sampled before being displayed.

==Object-based anti-aliasing==

A graphics rendering system creates an image based on objects constructed of polygonal primitives; the aliasing effects in the image can be reduced by applying an anti-aliasing scheme only to the areas of the image representing silhouette edges of the objects. The silhouette edges are anti-aliased by creating anti-aliasing primitives which vary in opacity. These anti-aliasing primitives are joined to the silhouetted edges, and create a region in the image where the objects appear to blend into the background. The method has some important advantages over classical methods based on the accumulation buffer since it generates full-scene anti-aliasing in only two passes and does not require the use of additional memory required by the accumulation buffer. Object-based anti-aliasing was first developed at Silicon Graphics for their Indy workstation.

==Anti-aliasing and gamma compression==

Digital images are usually stored in a gamma-compressed format, but most optical anti-aliasing filters are linear. So to down-sample an image in a way that would match optical blurring, one should first convert it to a linear format, then apply the anti-aliasing filter, and finally convert it back to a gamma compressed format. Using linear arithmetic on a gamma-compressed image results in values which are slightly different from the ideal filter. This error is larger when dealing with high contrast areas, causing high contrast areas to become dimmer: bright details (such as a cat&#x27;s whiskers) become visually thinner, and dark details (such as tree branches) become thicker, relative to the optically anti-aliased image. Each pixel is individually distorted, meaning outlines become unsmooth after anti-aliasing. Because the conversion to and from a linear format greatly slows down the process, and because the differences are usually subtle, most image editing software, including Final Cut Pro and Adobe Photoshop, process images in the gamma-compressed domain.

Most modern GPUs support storing textures in memory in sRGB format, and can perform transformation to linear space and back transparently, with essentially no loss in performance.

If this is not taken into account, the resultant non-linear distortion will defeat the purpose of anti-aliasing calculations based on the assumption of a linear system response.

<text>AM broadcasting is radio broadcasting using amplitude modulation (AM) transmissions. It was the first method developed for making audio radio transmissions, and is still used worldwide, primarily for medium wave (also known as &quot;AM band&quot;) transmissions, but also on the longwave and shortwave radio bands.
The earliest experimental AM transmissions began in the early 1900s. However, widespread AM broadcasting was not established until the 1920s, following the development of vacuum tube receivers and transmitters. AM radio remained the dominant method of broadcasting for the next 30 years, a period called the &quot;Golden Age of Radio&quot;, until television broadcasting became widespread in the 1950s and received much of the programming previously carried by radio. Later, AM radio&#x27;s audiences declined greatly due to competition from FM (frequency modulation) radio, Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB), satellite radio, HD (digital) radio, Internet radio, music streaming services, and podcasting.

Compared to FM or digital transmissions, AM transmissions are more expensive to transmit due to the necessity of having to transmit a high power carrier wave to overcome ground losses, and the large antenna radiators required at the low broadcast frequencies, but can be sent over long distances via the ionosphere at night; however, they are much more susceptible to interference, and often have lower audio fidelity. Thus, AM broadcasters tend to specialize in spoken-word formats, such as talk radio, all-news radio and sports radio, with music formats primarily for FM and digital stations.

==History==

===Early broadcasting development===
The idea of broadcasting — the unrestricted transmission of signals to a widespread audience — dates back to the founding period of radio development, even though the earliest radio transmissions, originally known as &quot;Hertzian radiation&quot; and &quot;wireless telegraphy&quot;, used spark-gap transmitters that could only transmit the dots-and-dashes of Morse code. In October 1898 a London publication, &quot;The Electrician&quot;, noted that &quot;there are rare cases where, as Dr. [Oliver] Lodge once expressed it, it might be advantageous to &#x27;shout&#x27; the message, spreading it broadcast to receivers in all directions&quot;. However, it was recognized that this would involve significant financial issues, as that same year &quot;The Electrician&quot; also commented &quot;did not Prof. Lodge forget that no one wants to pay for shouting to the world on a system by which it would be impossible to prevent non-subscribers from benefiting gratuitously?&quot;

On January 1, 1902, Nathan Stubblefield gave a short-range &quot;wireless telephone&quot; demonstration, that included simultaneously broadcasting speech and music to seven locations throughout Murray, Kentucky. However, this was transmitted using induction rather than radio signals, and although Stubblefield predicted that his system would be perfected so that &quot;it will be possible to communicate with hundreds of homes at the same time&quot;, and &quot;a single message can be sent from a central station to all parts of the United States&quot;, he was unable to overcome the inherent distance limitations of this technology.

The earliest public radiotelegraph broadcasts were provided as government services, beginning with daily time signals inaugurated on January 1, 1905, by a number of U.S. Navy stations. In Europe, signals transmitted from a station located on the Eiffel Tower were received throughout much of Europe. In both the United States and France this led to a small market of receiver lines geared for jewelers who needed accurate time to set their clocks, including the Ondophone in France, and the De Forest RS-100 Jewelers Time Receiver in the United States
The ability to pick up time signal broadcasts, in addition to Morse code weather reports and news summaries, also attracted the interest of amateur radio enthusiasts.

===Early amplitude modulation (AM) transmitter technologies===
It was immediately recognized that, much like the telegraph had preceded the invention of the telephone, the ability to make audio radio transmissions would be a significant technical advance. Despite this knowledge, it still took two decades to perfect the technology needed to make quality audio transmissions. In addition, the telephone had rarely been used for distributing entertainment, outside of a few &quot;telephone newspaper&quot; systems, most of which were established in Europe, beginning with the Paris Théâtrophone. With this in mind, most early radiotelephone development envisioned that the device would be more profitably developed as a &quot;wireless telephone&quot; for personal communication, or for providing links where regular telephone lines could not be run, rather than for the uncertain finances of broadcasting.


The person generally credited as the primary early developer of AM technology is Canadian-born inventor Reginald Fessenden. The original spark-gap radio transmitters were impractical for transmitting audio, since they produced discontinuous pulses known as &quot;damped waves&quot;. Fessenden realized that what was needed was a new type of radio transmitter that produced steady &quot;undamped&quot; (better known as &quot;continuous wave&quot;) signals, which could then be &quot;modulated&quot; to reflect the sounds being transmitted.

Fessenden&#x27;s basic approach was disclosed in U.S. Patent 706,737, which he applied for on May 29, 1901, and was issued the next year. It called for the use of a high-speed alternator (referred to as &quot;an alternating-current dynamo&quot;) that generated &quot;pure sine waves&quot; and produced &quot;a continuous train of radiant waves of substantially uniform strength&quot;, or, in modern terminology, a continuous-wave (CW) transmitter. Fessenden began his research on audio transmissions while doing developmental work for the United States Weather Service on Cobb Island, Maryland. Because he did not yet have a continuous-wave transmitter, initially he worked with an experimental &quot;high-frequency spark&quot; transmitter, taking advantage of the fact that the higher the spark rate, the closer a spark-gap transmission comes to producing continuous waves. He later reported that, in the fall of 1900, he successfully transmitted speech over a distance of about 1.6 kilometers (one mile), which appears to have been the first successful audio transmission using radio signals. However, at this time the sound was far too distorted to be commercially practical. For a time he continued working with more sophisticated high-frequency spark transmitters, including versions that used compressed air, which began to take on some of the characteristics of arc-transmitters. Fessenden attempted to sell this form of radiotelephone for point-to-point communication, but was unsuccessful.

====Alternator transmitter====

Fessenden&#x27;s work with high-frequency spark transmissions was only a temporary measure. His ultimate plan for creating an audio-capable transmitter was to redesign an electrical alternator, which normally produced alternating current of at most a few hundred (Hz), to increase its rotational speed and so generate currents of tens-of-thousands Hz, thus producing a steady continuous-wave transmission when connected to an aerial. The next step, adopted from standard wire-telephone practice, was to insert a simple carbon microphone into the transmission line, to modulate the carrier wave signal to produce AM audio transmissions. However, it would take many years of expensive development before even a prototype alternator-transmitter would be ready, and a few years beyond that for high-power versions to become available.

Fessenden worked with General Electric&#x27;s (GE) Ernst F. W. Alexanderson, who in August 1906 delivered an improved model which operated at a transmitting frequency of approximately 50 kHz, although at low power. The alternator-transmitter achieved the goal of transmitting quality audio signals, but the lack of any way to amplify the signals meant they were somewhat weak. On December 21, 1906, Fessenden made an extensive demonstration of the new alternator-transmitter at Brant Rock, Massachusetts, showing its utility for point-to-point wireless telephony, including interconnecting his stations to the wire telephone network. As part of the demonstration, speech was transmitted 18 kilometers (11 miles) to a listening site at Plymouth, Massachusetts.

An &quot;American Telephone Journal&quot; account of the December 21 alternator-transmitter demonstration included the statement that &quot;It is admirably adapted to the transmission of news, music, etc. as, owing to the fact that no wires are needed, simultaneous transmission to many subscribers can be effected as easily as to a few&quot;, echoing the words of a handout distributed to the demonstration witnesses, which stated &quot;[Radio] Telephony is admirably adapted for transmitting news, stock quotations, music, race reports, etc. simultaneously over a city, on account of the fact that no wires are needed and a single apparatus can distribute to ten thousand subscribers as easily as to a few. It is proposed to erect stations for this purpose in the large cities here and abroad.&quot; However, other than two holiday transmissions reportedly made shortly after these demonstrations, Fessenden does not appear to have conducted any radio broadcasts for the general public, or to have even given additional thought about the potential of a regular broadcast service, and in a 1908 article providing a comprehensive review of the potential uses for his radiotelephone invention, he made no references to broadcasting.

Because there was no way to amplify electrical currents at this time, modulation was usually accomplished by a carbon microphone inserted directly in the antenna wire. This meant that the full transmitter power flowed through the microphone, and even using water cooling, the power handling ability of the microphones severely limited the power of the transmissions. Ultimately only a small number of large and powerful Alexanderson alternators would be developed. However, they would be almost exclusively used for long-range radiotelegraph communication, and occasionally for radiotelephone experimentation, but were never used for general broadcasting.

====Arc transmitters====
Almost all of the continuous wave AM transmissions made prior to 1915 were made by versions of the arc converter transmitter, which had been initially developed by Valdemar Poulsen in 1903. Arc transmitters worked by producing a pulsating electrical arc in an enclosed hydrogen atmosphere. They were much more compact than alternator transmitters, and could operate on somewhat higher transmitting frequencies. However, they suffered from some of the same deficiencies. The lack of any means to amplify electrical currents meant that, like the alternator transmitters, modulation was usually accomplished by a microphone inserted directly in the antenna wire, which again resulted in overheating issues, even with the use of water-cooled microphones. Thus, transmitter powers tended to be limited. The arc was also somewhat unstable, which reduced audio quality. Experimenters who used arc transmitters for their radiotelephone research included Ernst Ruhmer, Quirino Majorana, Charles &quot;Doc&quot; Herrold, and Lee de Forest.

====Vacuum tube transmitters====
Advances in vacuum tube technology (called &quot;valves&quot; in British usage), especially after around 1915, revolutionized radio technology. Vacuum tube devices could be used to amplify electrical currents, which overcame the overheating issues of needing to insert microphones directly in the transmission antenna circuit. Vacuum tube transmitters also provided high-quality AM signals, and could operate on higher transmitting frequencies than alternator and arc transmitters. Non-governmental radio transmissions were prohibited in many countries during World War I, but AM radiotelephony technology advanced greatly due to wartime research, and after the war the availability of tubes sparked a great increase in the number of amateur radio stations experimenting with AM transmission of news or music. Vacuum tubes remained the central technology of radio for 40 years, until transistors began to dominate in the late 1950s, and are still used in the highest power broadcast transmitters.

===Receivers===

Unlike telegraph and telephone systems, which used completely different types of equipment, most radio receivers were equally suitable for both radiotelegraph and radiotelephone reception. In 1903 and 1904 the electrolytic detector and thermionic diode (Fleming valve) were invented by Reginald Fessenden and John Ambrose Fleming, respectively. Most important, in 1904–1906 the crystal detector, the simplest and cheapest AM detector, was developed by G. W. Pickard. Homemade crystal radios spread rapidly during the next 15 years, providing ready audiences for the first radio broadcasts. One limitation of crystals sets was the lack of amplifying the signals, so listeners had to use earphones, and it required the development of vacuum-tube receivers before loudspeakers could be used. The dynamic cone loudspeaker, invented in 1924, greatly improved audio frequency response over the previous horn speakers, allowing music to be reproduced with good fidelity. AM radio offered the highest sound quality available in a home audio device prior to the introduction of the high-fidelity, long-playing record in the late 1940s.

Listening habits changed in the 1960s due to the introduction of the revolutionary transistor radio (Regency TR-1, the first transistor radio released December 1954), which was made possible by the invention of the transistor in 1948. (The transistor was invented at Bell labs and released in June 1948.) Their compact size — small enough to fit in a shirt pocket — and lower power requirements, compared to vacuum tubes, meant that for the first time radio receivers were readily portable. The transistor radio became the most widely used communication device in history, with billions manufactured by the 1970s. Radio became a ubiquitous &quot;companion medium&quot; which people could take with them anywhere they went.

===Early experimental broadcasts===

The demarcation between what is considered &quot;experimental&quot; and &quot;organized&quot; broadcasting is largely arbitrary. Listed below are some of the early AM radio broadcasts, which, due to their irregular schedules and limited purposes, can be classified as &quot;experimental&quot;:

* Christmas Eve 1906. Until the early 1930s, it was generally accepted that Lee de Forest&#x27;s series of demonstration broadcasts begun in 1907 were the first transmissions of music and entertainment by radio. However, in 1932 an article prepared by Samuel M. Kintner, a former associate of Reginald Fessenden, asserted that Fessenden had actually conducted two earlier broadcasts. This claim was based solely on information included in a January 29, 1932, letter that Fessenden had sent to Kintner. (Fessenden subsequently died five months before Kintner&#x27;s article appeared.) In his letter, Fessenden reported that, on the evening of December 24, 1906 (Christmas Eve), he had made the first of two broadcasts of music and entertainment to a general audience, using the alternator-transmitter at Brant Rock, Massachusetts. Fessenden remembered producing a short program that included playing a phonograph record, followed by his playing the violin and singing, and closing with a Bible reading. He also stated that a second short program was broadcast on December 31 (New Year&#x27;s Eve). The intended audience for both transmissions was primarily shipboard radio operators along the Atlantic seaboard. Fessenden claimed these two programs had been widely publicized in advance, with the Christmas Eve broadcast heard &quot;as far down&quot; as Norfolk, Virginia, while the New Year’s Eve broadcast had been received in the West Indies. However, extensive efforts to verify Fessenden&#x27;s claim during both the 50th and 100th anniversaries of the claimed broadcasts, which included reviewing ships&#x27; radio log accounts and other contemporary sources, have so far failed to confirm that these reported holiday broadcasts actually took place.
* 1907-1912. Lee de Forest conducted multiple test broadcasts beginning in 1907, and was widely quoted promoting the potential of organized radio broadcasting. Using a series of arc transmitters, he made his first entertainment broadcast in February 1907, transmitting electronic telharmonium music from his Parker Building laboratory station in New York City. This was followed by tests that included, in the fall, Eugenia Farrar singing &quot;I Love You Truly&quot; and &quot;Just Awearyin&#x27; for You&quot;. Additional promotional events in New York included live performances by famous Metropolitan Opera stars such as Mariette Mazarin and Enrico Caruso. He also broadcast phonograph music from the Eiffel Tower in Paris. His company equipped the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Great White Fleet with experimental arc radiotelephones for their 1908 around-the-world cruise, and the operators broadcast phonograph music as the ships entered ports like San Francisco and Honolulu.
* June 1910. In a June 23, 1910, notarized letter that was published in a catalog produced by the Electro Importing Company of New York, Charles &quot;Doc&quot; Herrold reported that, using one of that company&#x27;s spark coils to create a &quot;high frequency spark&quot; transmitter, he had successfully broadcast &quot;wireless phone concerts to local amateur wireless men&quot;. Herrold lived in San Jose, California.
* 1913. Robert Goldschmidt began experimental radiotelephone transmissions from the Laeken station, near Brussels, Belgium, and by March 13, 1914, the tests had been heard as far away as the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
* 1914–1919. &quot;University of Wisconsin electrical engineering Professor Edward Bennett sets up a personal radio transmitter on campus and in June 1915 is issued an Experimental radio station license with the call sign 9XM. Activities included regular Morse Code broadcasts of weather forecasts and sending game reports for a Wisconsin-Ohio State basketball game on February 17, 1917.
* January 15, 1920. Broadcasting in the United Kingdom began with impromptu news and phonograph music over 2MT, the 15 kW experimental tube transmitter at Marconi&#x27;s factory in Chelmsford, Essex, at a frequency of 120 kHz. On June 15, 1920, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper sponsored the first scheduled British radio concert, by the famed Australian opera diva Nellie Melba. This transmission was heard throughout much of Europe, including in Berlin, Paris, The Hague, Madrid, Spain, and Sweden. Chelmsford continued broadcasting concerts with noted performers. A few months later, in spite of burgeoning popularity, the government ended the broadcasts, due to complaints that the station&#x27;s longwave signal was interfering with more important communication, in particular military aircraft radio.
* August 27, 1920. Argentina made the first mass radio transmission as a communication medium. Medicine students of the UBA made the first radio program by transmitting Wagner&#x27;s Parsifal on radio and picked up by about 100 amateurs in the city, emitting from the roof of the Teatro Colón. They kept transmitting over the nights different operas being the first in offering a radio program. There were known as the &quot;Locos de la azotea&quot; (the crazies of the roof).

===Organized broadcasting===


Following World War I, the number of stations providing a regular broadcasting service greatly increased, primarily due to advances in vacuum-tube technology. In response to ongoing activities, government regulators eventually codified standards for which stations could make broadcasts intended for the general public, for example, in the United States formal recognition of a &quot;broadcasting service&quot; came with the establishment of regulations effective December 1, 1921, and Canadian authorities created a separate category of &quot;radio-telephone broadcasting stations&quot; in April 1922. However, there were numerous cases of entertainment broadcasts being presented on a regular schedule before their formal recognition by government regulators. Some early examples include:

* July 21, 1912. The first person to transmit entertainment broadcasts on a regular schedule appears to have been Charles &quot;Doc&quot; Herrold, who inaugurated weekly programs, using an arc transmitter, from his Wireless School station in San Jose, California. The broadcasts continued until the station was shut down due to the entrance of the United States into World War I in April 1917.
* March 28, 1914. The Laeken station in Belgium, under the oversight of Robert Goldschmidt, inaugurated a weekly series of concerts, transmitted at 5:00 p.m. on Saturdays. These continued for about four months until July, and were ended by the start of World War I. In August 1914 the Laeken facilities were destroyed, to keep them from falling into the hands of invading German troops.
* November 1916. De Forest perfected &quot;Oscillion&quot; power vacuum tubes, capable of use in radio transmitters, and inaugurated daily broadcasts of entertainment and news from his New York &quot;Highbridge&quot; station, 2XG. This station also suspended operations in April 1917 due to the prohibition of civilian radio transmissions following the United States&#x27; entry into World War I. Its most publicized program was the broadcasting of election results for the Hughes-Wilson presidential election on November 7, 1916, with updates provided by wire from the &quot;New York American&quot; offices. An estimated 7,000 radio listeners as far as 200 miles (320 kilometers) from New York heard election returns interspersed with patriotic music.
* April 17, 1919. Shortly after the end of World War I, F. S. McCullough at the Glenn L. Martin aviation plant in Cleveland, Ohio, began a weekly series of phonograph concerts. However, the broadcasts were soon suspended, due to interference complaints by the U.S. Navy. 
* November 6, 1919. The first scheduled (pre-announced in the press) Dutch radio broadcast was made by Nederlandsche Radio Industrie station PCGG at The Hague, which began regular concerts broadcasts. It found it had a large audience outside the Netherlands, mostly in the UK. (Rather than true AM signals, at least initially this station used a form of narrowband FM, which required receivers to be slightly detuned to receive the signals using slope detection.)
* Late 1919. De Forest&#x27;s New York station, 2XG, returned to the airwaves in late 1919 after having to suspend operations during World War I. The station continued to operate until early 1920, when it was shut down because the transmitter had been moved to a new location without permission.
* May 20, 1920. Experimental Canadian Marconi station XWA (later CFCF, deleted in 2010 as CINW) in Montreal began regular broadcasts, and claims status as the first commercial broadcaster in the world.
* June 1920. De Forest transferred 2XG&#x27;s former transmitter to San Francisco, California, where it was relicensed as 6XC, the &quot;California Theater station&quot;. By June 1920 the station began transmitting daily concerts. De Forest later stated that this was the &quot;first radio-telephone station devoted solely&quot; to broadcasting to the public.
* August 20, 1920. On this date the &quot;Detroit News&quot; began daily transmissions over station 8MK (later WWJ), located in the newspaper&#x27;s headquarters building. The newspaper began extensively publicizing station operations beginning on August 31, 1920, with a special program featuring primary election returns. Station management later claimed the title of being where &quot;commercial radio broadcasting began&quot;.
* November 2, 1920. Beginning on October 17, 1919, Westinghouse engineer Frank Conrad began broadcasting recorded and live music on a semi-regular schedule from his home station, 8XK in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania. This inspired his employer to begin its own ambitious service at the company&#x27;s headquarters in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Operations began, initially with the call sign 8ZZ, with an election night program featuring election returns on November 2, 1920. As KDKA, the station adopted a daily schedule beginning on December 21, 1920. This station is another contender for the title of &quot;first commercial station&quot;.
* January 3, 1921. University of Wisconsin - Regular schedule of voice broadcasts begin; 9XM is the first radio station in the United States to provide the weather forecast by voice (January 3). In September, farm market broadcasts are added. On November 1, 9XM carries the first live broadcast of a symphony orchestra—the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra from the UW Armory using a single microphone.

===Radio networks===

Because most longwave radio frequencies were used for international radiotelegraph communication, a majority of early broadcasting stations operated on mediumwave frequencies, whose limited range generally restricted them to local audiences. One method for overcoming this limitation, as well as a method for sharing program costs, was to create radio networks, linking stations together with telephone lines to provide a nationwide audience.

====United States====
In the U.S., the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) was the first organization to create a radio network, and also to promote commercial advertising, which it called &quot;toll&quot; broadcasting. Its flagship station, WEAF (now WFAN) in New York City, sold blocks of airtime to commercial sponsors that developed entertainment shows containing commercial messages. AT&amp;T held a monopoly on quality telephone lines, and by 1924 had linked 12 stations in Eastern cities into a &quot;chain&quot;. The Radio Corporation of America (RCA), General Electric, and Westinghouse organized a competing network around its own flagship station, RCA&#x27;s WJZ (now WABC) in New York City, but were hampered by AT&amp;T&#x27;s refusal to lease connecting lines or allow them to sell airtime. In 1926 AT&amp;T sold its radio operations to RCA, which used them to form the nucleus of the new NBC network. By the 1930s, most of the major radio stations in the country were affiliated with networks owned by two companies, NBC and CBS. In 1934, a third national network, the Mutual Radio Network, was formed as a cooperative owned by its stations.

====United Kingdom====
A second country which quickly adopted network programming was the United Kingdom, and its national network quickly became a prototype for a state-managed monopoly of broadcasting. A rising interest in radio broadcasting by the British public pressured the government to reintroduce the service, following its suspension in 1920. However, the government also wanted to avoid what it termed the &quot;chaotic&quot; U.S. experience of allowing large numbers of stations to operate with few restrictions. There were also concerns about broadcasting becoming dominated by the Marconi company. Arrangements were made for six large radio manufacturers to form a consortium, the British Broadcasting Company (BBC), established on 18 October 1922, which was given a monopoly on broadcasting. This enterprise was supported by a tax on radio sets sales, plus an annual license fee on receivers, collected by the Post Office. Initially the eight stations were allowed regional autonomy. In 1927, the original broadcasting organization was replaced by a government chartered British Broadcasting Corporation. an independent nonprofit supported solely by a 10 shilling receiver license fee. Both highbrow and mass-appeal programmes were carried by the National and Regional networks.

===&quot;Golden Age of Radio&quot;===
The period from the early 1920s through the 1940s is often called the &quot;Golden Age of Radio&quot;. During this period AM radio was the main source of home entertainment, until it was replaced by television. For the first time entertainment was provided from outside the home, replacing traditional forms of entertainment such as oral storytelling and music from family members. New forms were created, including radio plays, mystery serials, soap operas, quiz shows, variety hours, situation comedies and children&#x27;s shows. Radio news, including remote reporting, allowed listeners to be vicariously present at notable events.

Radio greatly eased the isolation of rural life. Political officials could now speak directly to millions of citizens. One of the first to take advantage of this was American president Franklin Roosevelt, who became famous for his fireside chats during the Great Depression. However, broadcasting also provided the means to use propaganda as a powerful government tool, and contributed to the rise of fascist and communist ideologies.

===Decline in popularity===

In the 1940s two new broadcast media, FM radio and television, began to provide extensive competition with the established broadcasting services. The AM radio industry suffered a serious loss of audience and advertising revenue, and coped by developing new strategies. Network broadcasting gave way to format broadcasting: instead of broadcasting the same programs all over the country, stations individually adopted specialized formats which appealed to different audiences, such as regional and local news, sports, &quot;talk&quot; programs, and programs targeted at minorities. Instead of live music, most stations began playing less expensive recorded music.

In the late 1960s and 1970s, top 40 rock and roll stations in the U.S. and Canada such as WABC and CHUM transmitted highly processed and extended audio to 11 kHz, successfully attracting huge audiences. For young people, listening to AM broadcasts and participating in their music surveys and contests was the social media of the time.

In the late 1970s, spurred by the exodus of musical programming to FM stations, the AM radio industry in the United States developed technology for broadcasting in stereo. Other nations adopted AM stereo, most commonly choosing Motorola&#x27;s C-QUAM, and in 1993 the United States also made the C-QUAM system its standard, after a period allowing four different standards to compete. The selection of a single standard improved acceptance of AM stereo, however overall there was limited adoption of AM stereo worldwide, and interest declined after 1990. With the continued migration of AM stations away from music to news, sports, and talk formats, receiver manufacturers saw little reason to adopt the more expensive stereo tuners, and thus radio stations have little incentive to upgrade to stereo transmission.

In countries where the use of directional antennas is common, such as the United States, transmitter sites consisting of multiple towers often occupy large tracts of land that have significantly increased in value over the decades, to the point that the value of land exceeds that of the station itself. This sometimes results in the sale of the transmitter site, with the station relocating to a more distant shared site using significantly less power, or completely shutting down operations.

The ongoing development of alternative transmission systems, including Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB), satellite radio, and HD (digital) radio, continued the decline of the popularity of the traditional broadcast technologies. These new options, including the introduction of Internet streaming, particularly resulted in the reduction of shortwave transmissions, as international broadcasters found ways to reach their audiences more easily.

In 2022 it was reported that AM radio was being removed from a number of electric vehicle (EV) models, including from cars manufactured by Tesla, Audi, Porsche, BMW and Volvo, reportedly due to automakers concerns that an EV&#x27;s higher electromagnetic interference can disrupt the reception of AM transmissions and hurt the listening experience, among other reasons. However the United States Congress has introduced a bill to require all vehicles sold in the US to have an AM receiver to receive emergency broadcasts.

==AM band revitalization efforts in the United States==
The FM broadcast band was established in 1941 in the United States, and at the time some suggested that the AM band would soon be eliminated. In 1948 wide-band FM&#x27;s inventor, Edwin H. Armstrong, predicted that &quot;The broadcasters will set up FM stations which will parallel, carry the same program, as over their AM stations... eventually the day will come, of course, when we will no longer have to build receivers capable of receiving both types of transmission, and then the AM transmitters will disappear.&quot; However, FM stations actually struggled for many decades, and it was not until 1978 that FM listenership surpassed that of AM stations. Since then the AM band&#x27;s share of the audience has continued to decline.

===Fairness Doctrine repeal===
In 1987, the elimination of the Fairness Doctrine requirement meant that talk shows, which were commonly carried by AM stations, could adopt a more focused presentation on controversial topics, without the distraction of having to provide airtime for any contrasting opinions. In addition, satellite distribution made it possible for programs to be economically carried on a national scale. The introduction of nationwide talk shows, most prominently Rush Limbaugh&#x27;s beginning in 1988, was sometimes credited with &quot;saving&quot; AM radio. However, these stations tended to attract older listeners who were of lesser interest to advertisers, and AM radio&#x27;s audience share continued to erode.

===AM stereo and AMAX standards===

In 1961, the FCC adopted a single standard for FM stereo transmissions, which was widely credited with enhancing FM&#x27;s popularity. Developing the technology for AM broadcasting in stereo was challenging due to the need to limit the transmissions to a 20 kHz bandwidth, while also making the transmissions backward compatible with existing non-stereo receivers.

In 1990, the FCC authorized an AM stereo standard developed by Magnavox, but two years later revised its decision to instead approve four competing implementations, saying it would &quot;let the marketplace decide&quot; which was best. The lack of a common standard resulted in consumer confusion and increased the complexity and cost of producing AM stereo receivers.

In 1993, the FCC again revised its policy, by selecting C-QUAM as the sole AM stereo implementation. In 1993, the FCC also endorsed, although it did not make mandatory, AMAX broadcasting standards that were developed by the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) and the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) with the intention of helping AM stations, especially ones with musical formats, become more competitive with FM broadcasters by promoting better quality receivers. However, the stereo AM and AMAX initiatives had little impact, and a 2015 review of these events concluded that

Initially the consumer manufacturers made a concerted attempt to specify performance of AM receivers through the 1993 AMAX standard, a joint effort of the EIA and the NAB, with FCC backing... The FCC rapidly followed up on this with codification of the CQUAM AM stereo standard, also in 1993. At this point, the stage appeared to be set for rejuvenation of the AM band. Nevertheless, with the legacy of confusion and disappointment in the rollout of the multiple incompatible AM stereo systems, and failure of the manufacturers (including the auto makers) to effectively promote AMAX radios, coupled with the ever-increasing background of noise in the band, the general public soon lost interest and moved on to other media.

===Expanded band===
On June 8, 1988, an International Telecommunication Union (ITU)-sponsored conference held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil adopted provisions, effective July 1, 1990, to extend the upper end of the Region 2 AM broadcast band, by adding ten frequencies which spanned from 1610 kHz to 1700 kHz. At this time it was suggested that as many as 500 U.S. stations could be assigned to the new frequencies.

On April 12, 1990, the FCC voted to begin the process of populating the expanded band, with the main priority being the reduction of interference on the existing AM band, by transferring selected stations to the new frequencies. It was now estimated that the expanded band could accommodate around 300 U.S. stations. However, it turned out that the number of possible station reassignments was much lower, with a 2006 accounting reporting that, out of 4,758 licensed U.S. AM stations, only 56 were now operating on the expanded band. Moreover, despite an initial requirement that by the end of five years either the original station or its expanded band counterpart had to cease broadcasting, as of 2015 there were 25 cases where the original standard band station was still on the air, despite also operating as an expanded band station.

===HD radio===

HD Radio is a digital audio broadcasting method developed by iBiquity. In 2002 its &quot;hybrid mode&quot;, which simultaneously transmits a standard analog signal as well as a digital one, was approved by the FCC for use by AM stations, initially only during daytime hours, due to concerns that during the night its wider bandwidth would cause unacceptable interference to stations on adjacent frequencies. In 2007 nighttime operation was also authorized.

The number of hybrid mode AM stations is not exactly known, because the FCC does not keep track of the stations employing the system, and some authorized stations have later turned it off. But as of 2020 the commission estimated that fewer than 250 AM stations were transmitting hybrid mode signals. On October 27, 2020, the FCC voted to allow AM stations to eliminate their analog transmissions and convert to all-digital operation, with the requirement that stations making the change had to continue to make programming available over &quot;at least one free over-the-air digital programming stream that is comparable to or better in audio quality than a standard analog broadcast&quot;.

===FM translator stations===

Despite the various actions, AM band audiences continued to contract, and the number of stations began to slowly decline. A 2009 FCC review reported that &quot;The story of AM radio over the last 50 years has been a transition from being the dominant form of audio entertainment for all age groups to being almost non-existent to the youngest demographic groups. Among persons aged 12–24, AM accounts for only 4% of listening, while FM accounts for 96%. Among persons aged 25–34, AM accounts for only 9% of listening, while FM accounts for 91%. The median age of listeners to the AM band is 57 years old, a full generation older than the median age of FM listeners.&quot;

In 2009, the FCC made a major regulatory change, when it adopted a policy allowing AM stations to simulcast over FM translator stations. Translators had previously been available only to FM broadcasters, in order to increase coverage in fringe areas. Their assignment for use by AM stations was intended to approximate the station&#x27;s daytime coverage, which in cases where the stations reduced power at night, often resulted in expanded nighttime coverage. Although the translator stations are not permitted to originate programming when the &quot;primary&quot; AM station is broadcasting, they are permitted to do so during nighttime hours for AM stations licensed for daytime-only operation.

Prior to the adoption of the new policy, as of March 18, 2009, the FCC had issued 215 Special Temporary Authority grants for FM translators relaying AM stations. After creation of the new policy, by 2011 there were approximately 500 in operation, and as of 2020 approximately 2,800 of the 4,570 licensed AM stations were rebroadcasting on one or more FM translators. In 2009 the FCC stated that &quot;We do not intend to allow these cross-service translators to be used as surrogates for FM stations&quot;. However, based on station slogans, especially in the case of recently adopted musical formats, in most cases the expectation is that listeners will primarily be tuning into the FM signal rather than the nominally &quot;primary&quot; AM station. A 2020 review noted that &quot;for many owners, keeping their AM stations on the air now is pretty much just about retaining their FM translator footprint rather than keeping the AM on the air on its own merits&quot;.

===Additional activities===
In 2018 the FCC, led by then-Commission Chairman Ajit Pai, proposed greatly reducing signal protection for 50 kW Class A &quot;clear channel&quot; stations. This would allow co-channel secondary stations to operate with higher powers, especially at night. However, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) expressed concerns that this would reduce the effectiveness of emergency communications.

===Electric vehicles===
In May 2023, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the United States introduced legislation making it illegal for automakers to eliminate AM radio from their cars. The lawmakers argue that AM radio is an important tool for public safety due to being a component of the Emergency Alert System (EAS). Some automakers have been eliminating AM radio from their electric vehicles (EVs) due to interference from the electric motors, but the lawmakers argue that this is a safety risk and that car owners should have access to AM radio regardless of the type of vehicle they drive. The proposed legislation would require all new vehicles to include AM radio at no additional charge, and it would also require automakers that have already eliminated AM radio to inform customers of alternatives.

==Other digital standards==
DRM30 is another standard to broadcast on the AM bands, with implementation in India and China, among other countries.

==Technical information==

AM radio technology is simpler than later transmission systems. An AM receiver detects amplitude variations in the radio waves at a particular frequency, then amplifies changes in the signal voltage to operate a loudspeaker or earphone. However, the simplicity of AM transmission also makes it vulnerable to &quot;static&quot; (radio noise, radio frequency interference) created by both natural atmospheric electrical activity such as lightning, and electrical and electronic equipment, including fluorescent lights, motors and vehicle ignition systems. In large urban centers, AM radio signals can be severely disrupted by metal structures and tall buildings. As a result, AM radio tends to do best in areas where FM frequencies are in short supply, or in thinly populated or mountainous areas where FM coverage is poor. Great care must be taken to avoid mutual interference between stations operating on the same frequency. In general, an AM transmission needs to be about 20 times stronger than an interfering signal to avoid a reduction in quality, in contrast to FM signals, where the &quot;capture effect&quot; means that the dominant signal needs to only be about twice as strong as the interfering one.

To allow room for more stations on the mediumwave broadcast band in the United States, in June 1989 the FCC adopted a National Radio Systems Committee (NRSC) standard that limited maximum transmitted audio bandwidth to 10.2 kHz, limiting occupied bandwidth to 20.4 kHz. The former audio limitation was 15 kHz resulting in bandwidth of 30 kHz. Another common limitation on AM fidelity is the result of receiver design, although some efforts have been made to improve this, notably through the AMAX standards adopted in the United States.

===Broadcast band frequencies===
AM broadcasts are used on several frequency bands. The allocation of these bands is governed by the ITU&#x27;s Radio Regulations and, on the national level, by each country&#x27;s telecommunications administration (the FCC in the U.S., for example) subject to international agreements.

The frequency ranges given here are those that are allocated to stations. Because of the bandwidth taken up by the sidebands, the range allocated for the band as a whole is usually about 5 kHz wider on either side.

====Longwave broadcasting====
&quot;Longwave&quot; (also known as Low frequency (LF)) (148.5 kHz – 283.5 kHz) Broadcasting stations in this band are assigned transmitting frequencies in the range 153 kHz – 279 kHz, and generally maintain 9 kHz spacing. 
Longwave assignments for broadcasting only exist in ITU Region 1 (Europe, Africa, and northern and central Asia) and are not allocated elsewhere. Individual stations have coverage measured in the hundreds of kilometers; however, there is only a very limited number of available broadcasting slots.

Most of the earliest broadcasting experiments took place on longwave frequencies; however, complaints about interference from existing services, particularly the military, led to most broadcasting moving to higher frequencies.

====Medium-wave broadcasting====
&quot;Medium wave&quot; (also known as Medium frequency (MF)), is by far the most commonly used AM broadcasting band. In ITU Regions 1 and 3, transmitting frequencies run from 531 kHz – 1602 kHz, with 9 kHz spacing (526.5 kHz – 1606.5 kHz), and in ITU Region 2 (the Americas), transmitting frequencies are 530 kHz – 1700 kHz, using 10 kHz spacing (525 kHz – 1705 kHz), including the ITU Extended AM broadcast band, authorized in Region 2, between 1605 kHz and 1705 kHz, previously used for police radio.

====Shortwave broadcasting====
&quot;Shortwave&quot; (also known as High frequency (HF)) transmissions range from approximately 2.3 to 26.1 MHz, divided into 14 broadcast bands. Shortwave broadcasts generally use a narrow 5 kHz channel spacing. Shortwave is used by audio services intended to be heard at great distances from the transmitting station. The long range of shortwave broadcasts comes at the expense of lower audio fidelity.

Most broadcast services use AM transmissions, although some use a modified version of AM such as Single-sideband modulation (SSB) or an AM-compatible version of SSB such as &quot;SSB with carrier reinserted&quot;.

====VHF AM broadcasting====
Beginning in the mid-1930s, the United States evaluated options for the establishment of broadcasting stations using much higher transmitting frequencies. In October 1937, the FCC announced a second band of AM stations, consisting of 75 channels spanning from 41.02 to 43.98 MHz, which were informally called &quot;Apex&quot;.

The 40 kHz spacing between adjacent frequencies was four times that of the 10 kHz spacing used on the standard AM broadcast band, which reduced adjacent-frequency interference, and provided more bandwidth for high-fidelity programming. However, this band was eliminated effective 1 January 1941, after the FCC determined that establishing a band of FM stations was preferable.

===Other distribution methods===

Beginning in the mid-1930s, starting with &quot;The Brown Network&quot; at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, a very low power broadcasting method known as carrier current was developed, and mostly adopted on U.S. college campuses. In this approach AM broadcast signals are distributed over electric power lines, which radiate a signal receivable at a short distance from the lines. In Switzerland a system known as &quot;wire broadcasting&quot; (&quot;Telefonrundspruch&quot; in German) transmitted AM signals over telephone lines in the longwave band until 1998, when it was shut down. In the UK, Rediffusion was an early pioneer of AM radio cable distribution.

Hybrid digital broadcast systems, which combine (mono analog) AM transmission with digital sidebands, have started to be used around the world. In the United States, iBiquity&#x27;s proprietary HD Radio has been adopted and approved by the FCC for medium wave transmissions, while Digital Radio Mondiale is a more open effort often used on the shortwave bands, and can be used alongside many AM broadcasts. Both of these standards are capable of broadcasting audio of significantly greater fidelity than that of standard AM with current bandwidth limitations, and a theoretical frequency response of 0–16 kHz, in addition to stereo sound and text data.

===Microbroadcasting===

Some microbroadcasters, especially those in the United States operating under the FCC&#x27;s Part 15 rules, and pirate radio operators on mediumwave and shortwave, achieve greater range than possible on the FM band. On mediumwave these stations often transmit on 1610 kHz to 1710 kHz. Hobbyists also use low-power AM (LPAM) transmitters to provide programming for vintage radio equipment in areas where AM programming is not widely available or does not carry programming the listener desires; in such cases the transmitter, which is designed to cover only the immediate property and perhaps nearby areas, is connected to a computer, an FM radio or an MP3 player. Microbroadcasting and pirate radio have generally been supplanted by streaming audio on the Internet, but some schools and hobbyists still use LPAM transmissions.

<doc id="113515" wikidata="Q1338307" url="?curid=113515" title="Black–Scholes model">
<text>The Black–Scholes or Black–Scholes–Merton model is a mathematical model for the dynamics of a financial market containing derivative investment instruments. From the parabolic partial differential equation in the model, known as the Black–Scholes equation, one can deduce the Black–Scholes formula, which gives a theoretical estimate of the price of European-style options and shows that the option has a &quot;unique&quot; price given the risk of the security and its expected return (instead replacing the security&#x27;s expected return with the risk-neutral rate). The equation and model are named after economists Fischer Black and Myron Scholes. Robert C. Merton, who first wrote an academic paper on the subject, is sometimes also credited.

The main principle behind the model is to hedge the option by buying and selling the underlying asset in a specific way to eliminate risk. This type of hedging is called &quot;continuously revised delta hedging&quot; and is the basis of more complicated hedging strategies such as those used by investment banks and hedge funds.

The model is widely used, although often with some adjustments, by options market participants. The model&#x27;s assumptions have been relaxed and generalized in many directions, leading to a plethora of models that are currently used in derivative pricing and risk management. The insights of the model, as exemplified by the Black–Scholes formula, are frequently used by market participants, as distinguished from the actual prices. These insights include no-arbitrage bounds and risk-neutral pricing (thanks to continuous revision). Further, the Black–Scholes equation, a partial differential equation that governs the price of the option, enables pricing using numerical methods when an explicit formula is not possible.

The Black–Scholes formula has only one parameter that cannot be directly observed in the market: the average future volatility of the underlying asset, though it can be found from the price of other options. Since the option value (whether put or call) is increasing in this parameter, it can be inverted to produce a &quot;volatility surface&quot; that is then used to calibrate other models, e.g. for OTC derivatives.

== History ==
Louis Bachelier&#x27;s thesis in 1900 was the earliest publication to apply Brownian motion to derivative pricing, though his work had little impact for many years and included important limitations for its application to modern markets. In the 1960&#x27;s Case Sprenkle, James Boness, Paul Samuelson, and Samuelson&#x27;s Ph.D. student at the time Robert C. Merton all made important improvements to the theory of options pricing. 

Fischer Black and Myron Scholes demonstrated in 1968 that a dynamic revision of a portfolio removes the expected return of the security, thus inventing the &quot;risk neutral argument&quot;. They based their thinking on work previously done by market researchers and practitioners including the work mentioned above, as well as work by Sheen Kassouf and Edward O. Thorp. Black and Scholes then attempted to apply the formula to the markets, but incurred financial losses, due to a lack of risk management in their trades. In 1970, they decided to return to the academic environment. After three years of efforts, the formula—named in honor of them for making it public—was finally published in 1973 in an article titled &quot;The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities&quot;, in the &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot;. Robert C. Merton was the first to publish a paper expanding the mathematical understanding of the options pricing model, and coined the term &quot;Black–Scholes options pricing model&quot;.

The formula led to a boom in options trading and provided mathematical legitimacy to the activities of the Chicago Board Options Exchange and other options markets around the world.

Merton and Scholes received the 1997 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for their work, the committee citing their discovery of the risk neutral dynamic revision as a breakthrough that separates the option from the risk of the underlying security. Although ineligible for the prize because of his death in 1995, Black was mentioned as a contributor by the Swedish Academy.

== Fundamental hypotheses ==
The Black–Scholes model assumes that the market consists of at least one risky asset, usually called the stock, and one riskless asset, usually called the money market, cash, or bond.

The following assumptions are made about the assets (which relate to the names of the assets):
* Risk-free rate: The rate of return on the riskless asset is constant and thus called the risk-free interest rate.
* Random walk: The instantaneous log return of the stock price is an infinitesimal random walk with drift; more precisely, the stock price follows a geometric Brownian motion, and it is assumed that the drift and volatility of the motion are constant. If drift and volatility are time-varying, a suitably modified Black–Scholes formula can be deduced, as long as the volatility is not random.
* The stock does not pay a dividend.

The assumptions about the market are:
* No arbitrage opportunity (i.e., there is no way to make a riskless profit).
* Ability to borrow and lend any amount, even fractional, of cash at the riskless rate.
* Ability to buy and sell any amount, even fractional, of the stock (this includes short selling).
* The above transactions do not incur any fees or costs (i.e., frictionless market).

With these assumptions, suppose there is a derivative security also trading in this market. It is specified that this security will have a certain payoff at a specified date in the future, depending on the values taken by the stock up to that date. Even though the path the stock price will take in the future is unknown, the derivative&#x27;s price can be determined at the current time. For the special case of a European call or put option, Black and Scholes showed that &quot;it is possible to create a hedged position, consisting of a long position in the stock and a short position in the option, whose value will not depend on the price of the stock&quot;. Their dynamic hedging strategy led to a partial differential equation which governs the price of the option. Its solution is given by the Black–Scholes formula.

Several of these assumptions of the original model have been removed in subsequent extensions of the model. Modern versions account for dynamic interest rates (Merton, 1976), transaction costs and taxes (Ingersoll, 1976), and dividend payout.

== Notation ==
The notation used in the analysis of the Black-Scholes model is defined as follows (definitions grouped by subject):

General and market related:
:formula_1 is a time in years; with formula_2 generally representing the present year.
:formula_3 is the annualized risk-free interest rate, continuously compounded (also known as the &quot;force of interest&quot;).
Asset related:
:formula_4 is the price of the underlying asset at time &quot;t&quot;, also denoted as formula_5.
:formula_6 is the drift rate of formula_7, annualized.
:formula_8 is the standard deviation of the stock&#x27;s returns. This is the square root of the quadratic variation of the stock&#x27;s log price process, a measure of its volatility.
Option related:
:formula_9 is the price of the option as a function of the underlying asset &quot;S&quot; at time &quot;t,&quot; in particular:
:formula_10 is the price of a European call option and 
:formula_11 is the price of a European put option.
:formula_12 is the time of option expiration.
:formula_13 is the time until maturity: formula_14.
:formula_15 is the strike price of the option, also known as the exercise price.

formula_16 denotes the standard normal cumulative distribution function:
:formula_17

formula_18 denotes the standard normal probability density function:
:formula_19

==Black–Scholes equation==
The Black–Scholes equation is a parabolic partial differential equation that describes the price formula_20 of the option, where formula_7 is the price of the underlying asset and formula_1 is time:

:formula_23

A key financial insight behind the equation is that one can perfectly hedge the option by buying and selling the underlying asset and the bank account asset (cash) in such a way as to &quot;eliminate risk&quot;. This implies that there is a unique price for the option given by the Black–Scholes formula (see the next section).

==Black–Scholes formula==
The Black–Scholes formula calculates the price of European put and call options. This price is consistent with the Black–Scholes equation. This follows since the formula can be obtained by solving the equation for the corresponding terminal and boundary conditions:

:formula_24

The value of a call option for a non-dividend-paying underlying stock in terms of the Black–Scholes parameters is:
:formula_25

The price of a corresponding put option based on put–call parity with discount factor formula_26 is:
:formula_27

===Alternative formulation===
Introducing auxiliary variables allows for the formula to be simplified and reformulated in a form that can be more convenient (this is a special case of the Black &#x27;76 formula):
:formula_28

where:

formula_29 is the discount factor

formula_30 is the forward price of the underlying asset, and formula_31

Given put–call parity, which is expressed in these terms as:
:formula_32

the price of a put option is:
:formula_33

===Interpretation===
It is possible to have intuitive interpretations of the Black–Scholes formula, with the main subtlety being the interpretation of formula_34 and why there are two different terms.

The formula can be interpreted by first decomposing a call option into the difference of two binary options: an asset-or-nothing call minus a cash-or-nothing call (long an asset-or-nothing call, short a cash-or-nothing call). A call option exchanges cash for an asset at expiry, while an asset-or-nothing call just yields the asset (with no cash in exchange) and a cash-or-nothing call just yields cash (with no asset in exchange). The Black–Scholes formula is a difference of two terms, and these two terms are equal to the values of the binary call options. These binary options are less frequently traded than vanilla call options, but are easier to analyze.

Thus the formula:
:formula_35

breaks up as:
:formula_36

where formula_37 is the present value of an asset-or-nothing call and formula_38 is the present value of a cash-or-nothing call. The &quot;D&quot; factor is for discounting, because the expiration date is in future, and removing it changes &quot;present&quot; value to &quot;future&quot; value (value at expiry). Thus formula_39 is the future value of an asset-or-nothing call and formula_40 is the future value of a cash-or-nothing call. In risk-neutral terms, these are the expected value of the asset and the expected value of the cash in the risk-neutral measure.

A naive, and slightly incorrect, interpretation of these terms is that formula_41 is the probability of the option expiring in the money formula_42, multiplied by the value of the underlying at expiry &quot;F,&quot; while formula_43 is the probability of the option expiring in the money formula_44 multiplied by the value of the cash at expiry &quot;K.&quot; This interpretation is incorrect because either both binaries expire in the money or both expire out of the money (either cash is exchanged for the asset or it is not), but the probabilities formula_42 and formula_46 are not equal. In fact, formula_34 can be interpreted as measures of moneyness (in standard deviations) and formula_48 as probabilities of expiring ITM (&quot;percent moneyness&quot;), in the respective numéraire, as discussed below. Simply put, the interpretation of the cash option, formula_43, is correct, as the value of the cash is independent of movements of the underlying asset, and thus can be interpreted as a simple product of &quot;probability times value&quot;, while the formula_41 is more complicated, as the probability of expiring in the money and the value of the asset at expiry are not independent. More precisely, the value of the asset at expiry is variable in terms of cash, but is constant in terms of the asset itself (a fixed quantity of the asset), and thus these quantities are independent if one changes numéraire to the asset rather than cash.

If one uses spot &quot;S&quot; instead of forward &quot;F,&quot; in formula_34 instead of the formula_52 term there is formula_53 which can be interpreted as a drift factor (in the risk-neutral measure for appropriate numéraire). The use of &quot;d&quot;− for moneyness rather than the standardized moneyness formula_54 in other words, the reason for the formula_52 factor is due to the difference between the median and mean of the log-normal distribution; it is the same factor as in Itō&#x27;s lemma applied to geometric Brownian motion. In addition, another way to see that the naive interpretation is incorrect is that replacing formula_42 by formula_46 in the formula yields a negative value for out-of-the-money call options.

In detail, the terms formula_58 are the &quot;probabilities of the option expiring in-the-money&quot; under the equivalent exponential martingale probability measure (numéraire=stock) and the equivalent martingale probability measure (numéraire=risk free asset), respectively. The risk neutral probability density for the stock price formula_59 is
:formula_60

where formula_61 is defined as above.

Specifically, formula_46 is the probability that the call will be exercised provided one assumes that the asset drift is the risk-free rate. formula_42, however, does not lend itself to a simple probability interpretation. formula_64 is correctly interpreted as the present value, using the risk-free interest rate, of the expected asset price at expiration, given that the asset price at expiration is above the exercise price. For related discussion and graphical representation see Datar–Mathews method for real option valuation.

The equivalent martingale probability measure is also called the risk-neutral probability measure. Note that both of these are &quot;probabilities&quot; in a measure theoretic sense, and neither of these is the true probability of expiring in-the-money under the real probability measure. To calculate the probability under the real (&quot;physical&quot;) probability measure, additional information is required—the drift term in the physical measure, or equivalently, the market price of risk.

====Derivations====

A standard derivation for solving the Black–Scholes PDE is given in the article Black–Scholes equation.

The Feynman–Kac formula says that the solution to this type of PDE, when discounted appropriately, is actually a martingale. Thus the option price is the expected value of the discounted payoff of the option. Computing the option price via this expectation is the risk neutrality approach and can be done without knowledge of PDEs. Note the expectation of the option payoff is not done under the real world probability measure, but an artificial risk-neutral measure, which differs from the real world measure. For the underlying logic see section &quot;risk neutral valuation&quot; under Rational pricing as well as section &quot;Derivatives pricing: the Q world&quot; under Mathematical finance; for details, once again, see Hull.

==The Options Greeks==
&quot;The Greeks&quot; measure the sensitivity of the value of a derivative product or a financial portfolio to changes in parameter values while holding the other parameters fixed. They are partial derivatives of the price with respect to the parameter values. One Greek, &quot;gamma&quot; (as well as others not listed here) is a partial derivative of another Greek, &quot;delta&quot; in this case.

The Greeks are important not only in the mathematical theory of finance, but also for those actively trading. Financial institutions will typically set (risk) limit values for each of the Greeks that their traders must not exceed.

Delta is the most important Greek since this usually confers the largest risk. Many traders will zero their delta at the end of the day if they are not speculating on the direction of the market and following a delta-neutral hedging approach as defined by Black–Scholes. When a trader seeks to establish an effective delta-hedge for a portfolio, the trader may also seek to neutralize the portfolio&#x27;s gamma, as this will ensure that the hedge will be effective over a wider range of underlying price movements.

The Greeks for Black–Scholes are given in closed form below. They can be obtained by differentiation of the Black–Scholes formula.
Note that the gamma and vega are the same value for calls and puts. This can be seen directly from put–call parity, since the difference of a put and a call is a forward, which is linear in &quot;S&quot; and independent of &quot;σ&quot; (so a forward has zero gamma and zero vega).

In practice, some sensitivities are usually quoted in scaled-down terms, to match the scale of likely changes in the parameters. For example, rho is often reported divided by 10,000 (1 basis point rate change), vega by 100 (1 vol point change), and theta by 365 or 252 (1 day decay based on either calendar days or trading days per year).

Note that &quot;Vega&quot; is not a letter in the Greek alphabet; the name arises from misreading the Greek letter nu (variously rendered as formula_65, , and ν) as a V.

==Extensions of the model==
The above model can be extended for variable (but deterministic) rates and volatilities. The model may also be used to value European options on instruments paying dividends. In this case, closed-form solutions are available if the dividend is a known proportion of the stock price. American options and options on stocks paying a known cash dividend (in the short term, more realistic than a proportional dividend) are more difficult to value, and a choice of solution techniques is available (for example lattices and grids).

===Instruments paying continuous yield dividends===
For options on indices, it is reasonable to make the simplifying assumption that dividends are paid continuously, and that the dividend amount is proportional to the level of the index.

The dividend payment paid over the time period formula_66 is then modelled as:
:formula_67

for some constant formula_68 (the dividend yield).

Under this formulation the arbitrage-free price implied by the Black–Scholes model can be shown to be:
:formula_69

and
:formula_70

where now
:formula_71

is the modified forward price that occurs in the terms formula_72:
:formula_73

and
:formula_74.

===Instruments paying discrete proportional dividends===
It is also possible to extend the Black–Scholes framework to options on instruments paying discrete proportional dividends. This is useful when the option is struck on a single stock.

A typical model is to assume that a proportion formula_75 of the stock price is paid out at pre-determined times formula_76. The price of the stock is then modelled as:
:formula_77

where formula_78 is the number of dividends that have been paid by time formula_1.

The price of a call option on such a stock is again:
:formula_80

where now
:formula_81

is the forward price for the dividend paying stock.

===American options===
The problem of finding the price of an American option is related to the optimal stopping problem of finding the time to execute the option. Since the American option can be exercised at any time before the expiration date, the Black–Scholes equation becomes a variational inequality of the form:
:formula_82
together with formula_83 where formula_84 denotes the payoff at stock price formula_7 and the terminal condition: formula_86.

In general this inequality does not have a closed form solution, though an American call with no dividends is equal to a European call and the Roll–Geske–Whaley method provides a solution for an American call with one dividend; see also Black&#x27;s approximation.

Barone-Adesi and Whaley is a further approximation formula. Here, the stochastic differential equation (which is valid for the value of any derivative) is split into two components: the European option value and the early exercise premium. With some assumptions, a quadratic equation that approximates the solution for the latter is then obtained. This solution involves finding the critical value, formula_87, such that one is indifferent between early exercise and holding to maturity.

Bjerksund and Stensland provide an approximation based on an exercise strategy corresponding to a trigger price. Here, if the underlying asset price is greater than or equal to the trigger price it is optimal to exercise, and the value must equal formula_88, otherwise the option &quot;boils down to: (i) a European up-and-out call option… and (ii) a rebate that is received at the knock-out date if the option is knocked out prior to the maturity date&quot;. The formula is readily modified for the valuation of a put option, using put–call parity. This approximation is computationally inexpensive and the method is fast, with evidence indicating that the approximation may be more accurate in pricing long dated options than Barone-Adesi and Whaley.

==== Perpetual put ====
Despite the lack of a general analytical solution for American put options, it is possible to derive such a formula for the case of a perpetual option – meaning that the option never expires (i.e., formula_89). In this case, the time decay of the option is equal to zero, which leads to the Black–Scholes PDE becoming an ODE:formula_90Let formula_91 denote the lower exercise boundary, below which it is optimal to exercise the option. The boundary conditions are:formula_92The solutions to the ODE are a linear combination of any two linearly independent solutions:formula_93For formula_94, substitution of this solution into the ODE for formula_95 yields:formula_96Rearranging the terms gives:formula_97Using the quadratic formula, the solutions for formula_98 are:formula_99In order to have a finite solution for the perpetual put, since the boundary conditions imply upper and lower finite bounds on the value of the put, it is necessary to set formula_100, leading to the solution formula_101. From the first boundary condition, it is known that:formula_102Therefore, the value of the perpetual put becomes:formula_103The second boundary condition yields the location of the lower exercise boundary:formula_104To conclude, for formula_105, the perpetual American put option is worth:formula_106

===Binary options===
By solving the Black–Scholes differential equation with the Heaviside function as a boundary condition, one ends up with the pricing of options that pay one unit above some predefined strike price and nothing below.

In fact, the Black–Scholes formula for the price of a vanilla call option (or put option) can be interpreted by decomposing a call option into an asset-or-nothing call option minus a cash-or-nothing call option, and similarly for a put—the binary options are easier to analyze, and correspond to the two terms in the Black–Scholes formula.

====Cash-or-nothing call====
This pays out one unit of cash if the spot is above the strike at maturity. Its value is given by:
:formula_107

====Cash-or-nothing put====
This pays out one unit of cash if the spot is below the strike at maturity. Its value is given by:
:formula_108

====Asset-or-nothing call====
This pays out one unit of asset if the spot is above the strike at maturity. Its value is given by:
:formula_109

====Asset-or-nothing put====
This pays out one unit of asset if the spot is below the strike at maturity. Its value is given by:
:formula_110

====Foreign Exchange (FX) ====
Denoting by &quot;S&quot; the FOR/DOM exchange rate (i.e., 1 unit of foreign currency is worth S units of domestic currency) one can observe that paying out 1 unit of the domestic currency if the spot at maturity is above or below the strike is exactly like a cash-or nothing call and put respectively. Similarly, paying out 1 unit of the foreign currency if the spot at maturity is above or below the strike is exactly like an asset-or nothing call and put respectively.
Hence by taking formula_111, the foreign interest rate, formula_112, the domestic interest rate, and the rest as above, the following results can be obtained:

In the case of a digital call (this is a call FOR/put DOM) paying out one unit of the domestic currency gotten as present value:
:formula_113
In the case of a digital put (this is a put FOR/call DOM) paying out one unit of the domestic currency gotten as present value:
:formula_114
In the case of a digital call (this is a call FOR/put DOM) paying out one unit of the foreign currency gotten as present value:
:formula_115
In the case of a digital put (this is a put FOR/call DOM) paying out one unit of the foreign currency gotten as present value:
:formula_116

====Skew====
In the standard Black–Scholes model, one can interpret the premium of the binary option in the risk-neutral world as the expected value = probability of being in-the-money * unit, discounted to the present value. The Black–Scholes model relies on symmetry of distribution and ignores the skewness of the distribution of the asset. Market makers adjust for such skewness by, instead of using a single standard deviation for the underlying asset formula_8 across all strikes, incorporating a variable one formula_118 where volatility depends on strike price, thus incorporating the volatility skew into account. The skew matters because it affects the binary considerably more than the regular options.

A binary call option is, at long expirations, similar to a tight call spread using two vanilla options. One can model the value of a binary cash-or-nothing option, &quot;C&quot;, at strike &quot;K&quot;, as an infinitesimally tight spread, where formula_119 is a vanilla European call:
:formula_120
Thus, the value of a binary call is the negative of the derivative of the price of a vanilla call with respect to strike price:
:formula_121

When one takes volatility skew into account, formula_8 is a function of formula_15:
:formula_124

The first term is equal to the premium of the binary option ignoring skew:
:formula_125

formula_126 is the Vega of the vanilla call; formula_127 is sometimes called the &quot;skew slope&quot; or just &quot;skew&quot;. If the skew is typically negative, the value of a binary call will be higher when taking skew into account.
:formula_128

====Relationship to vanilla options&#x27; Greeks====
Since a binary call is a mathematical derivative of a vanilla call with respect to strike, the price of a binary call has the same shape as the delta of a vanilla call, and the delta of a binary call has the same shape as the gamma of a vanilla call.

==Black–Scholes in practice==

The assumptions of the Black–Scholes model are not all empirically valid. The model is widely employed as a useful approximation to reality, but proper application requires understanding its limitations blindly following the model exposes the user to unexpected risk. Among the most significant limitations are:

* the underestimation of extreme moves, yielding tail risk, which can be hedged with out-of-the-money options;
* the assumption of instant, cost-less trading, yielding liquidity risk, which is difficult to hedge;
* the assumption of a stationary process, yielding volatility risk, which can be hedged with volatility hedging;
* the assumption of continuous time and continuous trading, yielding gap risk, which can be hedged with Gamma hedging;
* the model tends to underprice deep out-of-the-money options and overprice deep in-the-money options.

In short, while in the Black–Scholes model one can perfectly hedge options by simply Delta hedging, in practice there are many other sources of risk.

Results using the Black–Scholes model differ from real world prices because of simplifying assumptions of the model. One significant limitation is that in reality security prices do not follow a strict stationary log-normal process, nor is the risk-free interest actually known (and is not constant over time). The variance has been observed to be non-constant leading to models such as GARCH to model volatility changes. Pricing discrepancies between empirical and the Black–Scholes model have long been observed in options that are far out-of-the-money, corresponding to extreme price changes; such events would be very rare if returns were lognormally distributed, but are observed much more often in practice.

Nevertheless, Black–Scholes pricing is widely used in practice, because it is:

* easy to calculate
* a useful approximation, particularly when analyzing the direction in which prices move when crossing critical points
* a robust basis for more refined models
* reversible, as the model&#x27;s original output, price, can be used as an input and one of the other variables solved for; the implied volatility calculated in this way is often used to quote option prices (that is, as a &quot;quoting convention&quot;).

The first point is self-evidently useful. The others can be further discussed:

Useful approximation: although volatility is not constant, results from the model are often helpful in setting up hedges in the correct proportions to minimize risk. Even when the results are not completely accurate, they serve as a first approximation to which adjustments can be made.

Basis for more refined models: The Black–Scholes model is &quot;robust&quot; in that it can be adjusted to deal with some of its failures. Rather than considering some parameters (such as volatility or interest rates) as &quot;constant,&quot; one considers them as &quot;variables,&quot; and thus added sources of risk. This is reflected in the Greeks (the change in option value for a change in these parameters, or equivalently the partial derivatives with respect to these variables), and hedging these Greeks mitigates the risk caused by the non-constant nature of these parameters. Other defects cannot be mitigated by modifying the model, however, notably tail risk and liquidity risk, and these are instead managed outside the model, chiefly by minimizing these risks and by stress testing.

Explicit modeling: this feature means that, rather than &quot;assuming&quot; a volatility &quot;a priori&quot; and computing prices from it, one can use the model to solve for volatility, which gives the implied volatility of an option at given prices, durations and exercise prices. Solving for volatility over a given set of durations and strike prices, one can construct an implied volatility surface. In this application of the Black–Scholes model, a coordinate transformation from the &quot;price domain&quot; to the &quot;volatility domain&quot; is obtained. Rather than quoting option prices in terms of dollars per unit (which are hard to compare across strikes, durations and coupon frequencies), option prices can thus be quoted in terms of implied volatility, which leads to trading of volatility in option markets.

===The volatility smile===

One of the attractive features of the Black–Scholes model is that the parameters in the model other than the volatility (the time to maturity, the strike, the risk-free interest rate, and the current underlying price) are unequivocally observable. All other things being equal, an option&#x27;s theoretical value is a monotonic increasing function of implied volatility.

By computing the implied volatility for traded options with different strikes and maturities, the Black–Scholes model can be tested. If the Black–Scholes model held, then the implied volatility for a particular stock would be the same for all strikes and maturities. In practice, the volatility surface (the 3D graph of implied volatility against strike and maturity) is not flat.

The typical shape of the implied volatility curve for a given maturity depends on the underlying instrument. Equities tend to have skewed curves: compared to at-the-money, implied volatility is substantially higher for low strikes, and slightly lower for high strikes. Currencies tend to have more symmetrical curves, with implied volatility lowest at-the-money, and higher volatilities in both wings. Commodities often have the reverse behavior to equities, with higher implied volatility for higher strikes.

Despite the existence of the volatility smile (and the violation of all the other assumptions of the Black–Scholes model), the Black–Scholes PDE and Black–Scholes formula are still used extensively in practice. A typical approach is to regard the volatility surface as a fact about the market, and use an implied volatility from it in a Black–Scholes valuation model. This has been described as using &quot;the wrong number in the wrong formula to get the right price&quot;. This approach also gives usable values for the hedge ratios (the Greeks). Even when more advanced models are used, traders prefer to think in terms of Black–Scholes implied volatility as it allows them to evaluate and compare options of different maturities, strikes, and so on. For a discussion as to the various alternative approaches developed here, see .

===Valuing bond options===
Black–Scholes cannot be applied directly to bond securities because of pull-to-par. As the bond reaches its maturity date, all of the prices involved with the bond become known, thereby decreasing its volatility, and the simple Black–Scholes model does not reflect this process. A large number of extensions to Black–Scholes, beginning with the Black model, have been used to deal with this phenomenon. See .

===Interest rate curve===
In practice, interest rates are not constant—they vary by tenor (coupon frequency), giving an interest rate curve which may be interpolated to pick an appropriate rate to use in the Black–Scholes formula. Another consideration is that interest rates vary over time. This volatility may make a significant contribution to the price, especially of long-dated options. This is simply like the interest rate and bond price relationship which is inversely related.

===Short stock rate===
Taking a short stock position, as inherent in the derivation, is not typically free of cost; equivalently, it is possible to lend out a long stock position for a small fee. In either case, this can be treated as a continuous dividend for the purposes of a Black–Scholes valuation, provided that there is no glaring asymmetry between the short stock borrowing cost and the long stock lending income.

==Criticism and comments==
Espen Gaarder Haug and Nassim Nicholas Taleb argue that the Black–Scholes model merely recasts existing widely used models in terms of practically impossible &quot;dynamic hedging&quot; rather than &quot;risk&quot;, to make them more compatible with mainstream neoclassical economic theory. They also assert that Boness in 1964 had already published a formula that is &quot;actually identical&quot; to the Black–Scholes call option pricing equation. Edward Thorp also claims to have guessed the Black–Scholes formula in 1967 but kept it to himself to make money for his investors. Emanuel Derman and Taleb have also criticized dynamic hedging and state that a number of researchers had put forth similar models prior to Black and Scholes. In response, Paul Wilmott has defended the model.

In his 2008 letter to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett wrote: &quot;I believe the Black–Scholes formula, even though it is the standard for establishing the dollar liability for options, produces strange results when the long-term variety are being valued... The Black–Scholes formula has approached the status of holy writ in finance ... If the formula is applied to extended time periods, however, it can produce absurd results. In fairness, Black and Scholes almost certainly understood this point well. But their devoted followers may be ignoring whatever caveats the two men attached when they first unveiled the formula.&quot;

British mathematician Ian Stewart, author of the 2012 book entitled &quot;In Pursuit of the Unknown: 17 Equations That Changed the World&quot;, said that Black–Scholes had &quot;underpinned massive economic growth&quot; and the &quot;international financial system was trading derivatives valued at one quadrillion dollars per year&quot; by 2007. He said that the Black–Scholes equation was the &quot;mathematical justification for the trading&quot;—and therefore—&quot;one ingredient in a rich stew of financial irresponsibility, political ineptitude, perverse incentives and lax regulation&quot; that contributed to the financial crisis of 2007–08. He clarified that &quot;the equation itself wasn&#x27;t the real problem&quot;, but its abuse in the financial industry.

The Black–Scholes model assumes positive underlying prices; if the underlying has a negative price, the model does not work directly. When dealing with options whose underlying can go negative, practitioners may use a different model such as the Bachelier model or simply add a constant offset to the prices.

<text>Fischer Sheffey Black (January 11, 1938 – August 30, 1995) was an American economist, best known as one of the authors of the Black–Scholes equation. Working variously at the University of Chicago, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and at Goldman Sachs, Black died two years before the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (which is not given posthumously) was awarded to his collaborator Myron Scholes and former colleague Robert C. Merton for the Black-Scholes model and Merton&#x27;s application of the model to a continuous-time framework. Black also made significant contributions to the capital asset pricing model and the theory of accounting, as well as more controversial contributions in monetary economics and the theory of business cycles.

==Background==

Fischer Sheffey Black was born on January 11, 1938. He graduated from Harvard College with a major in physics in 1959 and received a PhD in applied mathematics from Harvard University in 1964. He was initially expelled from the PhD program due to his inability to settle on a thesis topic, having switched from physics to mathematics, then to computers and artificial intelligence. Black joined the consultancy Bolt, Beranek and Newman, working on a system for artificial intelligence. He spent a summer developing his ideas at the RAND corporation. He became a student of MIT professor Marvin Minsky, and was later able to submit his research for completion of the Harvard PhD.

Black joined Arthur D. Little, where he was first exposed to economic and financial consulting and where he met his future collaborator Jack Treynor. In 1971, he began to work at the University of Chicago. He later left the University of Chicago in 1975 to work at the MIT Sloan School of Management. In 1984, he joined Goldman Sachs where he worked until death.

==Economic career==

Black began thinking seriously about monetary policy around 1970 and found, at this time, that the big debate in this field was between Keynesians and monetarists. The Keynesians (under the leadership of Franco Modigliani) believe there is a natural tendency of the credit markets toward instability, toward boom and bust, and they assign to both monetary and fiscal policy roles in damping down this cycle, working toward the goal of smooth sustainable growth. In the Keynesian view, central bankers have to have discretionary powers to fulfill their role properly. Monetarists, under the leadership of Milton Friedman, believe that discretionary central banking is the problem, not the solution. Friedman believed that the growth of the money supply could and should be set at a constant rate, say 3% a year, to accommodate predictable growth in real GDP.

On the basis of the capital asset pricing model, Black concluded that discretionary monetary policy could not do the good that Keynesians wanted it to do. He concluded that monetary policy should be passive within an economy. But he also concluded that it could not do the harm monetarists feared it would do. Black said in a letter to Friedman, in January 1972:

In 1973, Black, along with Myron Scholes, published the paper &#x27;The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities&#x27; in &quot;The Journal of Political Economy&quot;. This was his most famous work and included the Black–Scholes equation.

In March 1976, Black proposed that human capital and business have &quot;ups and downs that are largely unpredictable [...] because of basic uncertainty about what people will want in the future and about what the economy will be able to produce in the future. If future tastes and technology were known, profits and wages would grow smoothly and surely over time.&quot; A boom is a period when technology matches well with demand. A bust is a period of mismatch. This view made Black an early contributor to real business cycle theory.

Economist Tyler Cowen has argued that Black&#x27;s work on monetary economics and business cycles can be used to explain the Great Recession.

Black&#x27;s works on monetary theory, business cycles and options are parts of his vision of a unified framework. He once stated: It can be shown that the mathematical techniques developed in the option theory can be extended to provide a mathematical analysis of monetary theory and business cycles as well.

==&quot;Business Cycles and Equilibrium&quot; (1987)==
Fischer Black has published many academic articles, including his best-known book, &quot;Business Cycles and Equilibrium&quot;. In this book, Black proposes at the beginning of the book to imagine a world where money does not exist. With its theory that economic and financial markets are in a continual equilibrium-is one of his books that still rings true today, given the current economic crisis. Building upon these statements, Black creates models as well as challenges monetary theorists, especially those who subscribe to the ideas of the quantity theory of money and liquidity of money. Banks are the main institutions of monetary transactions in Black&#x27;s book, to which he also states that money is an endogenous resource (contrary to monetarists who believe money to be an exogenous resource), provided by banks due to profit maximization. Controversial statements such as &quot;Monetary and exchange rate policies accomplish almost nothing, and fiscal policies are unimportant in causing or changing business cycles&quot; have made Black enemies with Keynesians and Monetarists alike.

==Illness and death==
In early 1994, Black was diagnosed with throat cancer. Surgery at first appeared successful, and Black was well enough to attend the annual meeting of the International Association of Financial Engineers that October, where he received their award as Financial Engineer of the Year. However, the cancer returned, and Black died in August 1995.

==Posthumous recognition==
The Nobel Prize is not given posthumously, so it was not awarded to Black in 1997 when his co-author Scholes received the honor for their landmark work on option pricing along with Robert C. Merton, another pioneer in the development of valuation of stock options. However, when announcing the award that year, the Nobel committee did prominently mention Black&#x27;s key role.

Black has also received recognition as the co-author of the Black–Derman–Toy interest rate derivatives model, which was developed for in-house use by Goldman Sachs in the 1980s but eventually published. He also co-authored the Black–Litterman model on global asset allocation while at Goldman Sachs.

The advisory board of &quot;The Journal of Performance Measurement&quot; inducted Black into the Performance &amp; Risk Measurement Hall of Fame in 2017.

<text>Myron Samuel Scholes ( ; born July 1, 1941) is a Canadian–American financial economist. Scholes is the Frank E. Buck Professor of Finance, Emeritus, at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences, and co-originator of the Black–Scholes options pricing model. Scholes is currently the Chief Investment Strategist at Janus Henderson. Previously he served as the chairman of Platinum Grove Asset Management and on the Dimensional Fund Advisors board of directors, American Century Mutual Fund board of directors, chairman of the Board of Economic Advisers of Stamos Capital Partners, and the Cutwater Advisory Board. He was a principal and limited partner at Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a highly leveraged hedge fund that collapsed in 1998, and a managing director at Salomon Brothers. Other positions Scholes held include the Edward Eagle Brown Professor of Finance at the University of Chicago, senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution, director of the Center for Research in Security Prices, and professor of finance at MIT&#x27;s Sloan School of Management. Scholes earned his PhD at the University of Chicago.

In 1997, Scholes – together with Robert C. Merton – was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for a method to determine the value of derivatives. The model provides a conceptual framework for valuing options, such as calls or puts, and is referred to as the Black–Scholes model.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Scholes was born to a Jewish family on July 1, 1941, in Timmins, Ontario, where his family had moved during the Great Depression. In 1951 the family moved to Hamilton, Ontario. Scholes was a good student although fighting with his impaired vision starting with his teens until finally getting an operation when he was twenty-six. Through his family, he became interested in economics early, as he helped with his uncles&#x27; businesses and his parents helped him open an account for investing in the stock market while he was in high school.

After his mother died from cancer, Scholes remained in Hamilton for undergraduate studies and earned a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics from McMaster University in 1962. One of his professors at McMaster introduced him to the works of George Stigler and Milton Friedman, two University of Chicago economists who would later both win Nobel prizes in economics. After receiving his B.A. he decided to enroll in graduate studies in economics at the University of Chicago. Here, Scholes was a colleague with Michael Jensen and Richard Roll, and he had the opportunity to study with Eugene Fama and Merton Miller, researchers who were developing the relatively new field of financial economics. He earned his MBA at the Booth School of Business in 1964 and his Ph.D. in 1969 with a dissertation written under the supervision of Eugene Fama and Merton Miller.

===Academic career===
In 1968, after finishing his dissertation, Scholes took an academic position at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Here he met Fischer Black, who was a consultant for Arthur D. Little at the time, and Robert C. Merton, who joined MIT in 1970. For the following years Scholes, Black and Merton undertook groundbreaking research in asset pricing, including the work on their famous option pricing model. At the same time, Scholes continued collaborating with Merton Miller and Michael Jensen. In 1973 he decided to move to the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, looking forward to work closely with Eugene Fama, Merton Miller and Fischer Black, who had taken his first academic position at Chicago in 1972 (although he moved two years later to MIT). While at Chicago, Scholes also started working closely with the Center for Research in Security Prices, helping to develop and analyze its famous database of high frequency stock market data.

In 1981 he moved to Stanford University, where he remained until he retired from teaching in 1996. Since then he holds the position of Frank E. Buck Professor of Finance Emeritus at Stanford. While at Stanford his research interest concentrated on the economics of investment banking and tax planning in corporate finance.

In 1997 he shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics with Robert C. Merton &quot;for a new method to determine the value of derivatives&quot;. Fischer Black, who co-authored with them the work that was awarded, had died in 1995 and thus was not eligible for the prize.

In 2012, he authored an article entitled &#x27;Not All Growth Is Good&#x27; in &quot;The 4% Solution: Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs&quot;, published by the George W. Bush Presidential Center.

===Investment activity===

In 1990 Scholes became more involved directly with the financial markets. He went to Salomon Brothers as a special consultant, then becoming a managing director and co-head of its fixed-income-derivative group. In 1994 Scholes joined several colleagues, including John Meriwether, the former vice-chairman and head of bond trading at Salomon Brothers, and his future Nobel Memorial Prize co-winner Robert C. Merton, and co-founded a hedge fund called Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM). The fund, which started operations with $1 billion of investor capital, performed extremely well in the first years, realizing annualized returns of over 40%. However, following the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 1998 Russian financial crisis the highly leveraged fund in 1998 lost $4.6 billion in less than four months and collapsed abruptly, becoming one of the most prominent examples of risk potential in the investment industry.

LTCM brought legal problems for Scholes in 2005 in the case of &quot;Long-Term Capital Holdings v. United States&quot;. The firm&#x27;s corporate structure and accounting had established an offshore tax shelter to avoid taxes on investment profits. Courts disallowed the firm&#x27;s claim of $40 million in tax savings, finding it based on formal accounting losses of $106 million that represented no economic substance.

Subsequent to LTCM, in 1999 Scholes joined Oak Hill Capital, the private equity firm led by Robert Bass. There, Scholes and his LTCM colleague, Chi-Fu Huang, launched a new hedge fund, Oak Hill Platinum Partners. 

Scholes is also chief investment strategist at Janus Henderson, a role he held at legacy firm Janus Capital Group since 2014. Janus Capital merged with Henderson Group in 2017 to form Janus Henderson. In this role, he leads the firm&#x27;s evolving asset allocation product development efforts and partners with the investment team contributing macro insights and quantitative analysis specific to hedging, risk management and disciplined portfolio construction.

<text>In finance, being short in an asset means investing in such a way that the investor will profit if the market value of the asset falls. This is the opposite of the more common long position, where the investor will profit if the market value of the asset rises. An investor that sells an asset short is, as to that asset, a short seller.

There are a number of ways of achieving a short position. The most basic is physical selling short or short-selling, by which the short seller borrows an asset (often a security such as a share of stock or a bond) and quickly sells it. The short seller must later buy the same amount of the asset to return it to the lender. If the market value of the asset has fallen in the meantime, the short seller will have made a profit equal to the difference. Conversely, if the price has risen then the short seller will bear a loss. The short seller usually must pay a handling fee to borrow the asset (charged at a particular rate over time, similar to an interest payment) and reimburse the lender for any cash return (such as a dividend) that was paid on the asset while borrowed.

A short position can also be created through a futures contract, forward contract, or option contract, by which the short seller assumes an obligation or right to sell an asset at a future date at a price stated in the contract. If the price of the asset falls below the contract price, the short seller can buy it at the lower market value and immediately sell it at the higher price specified in the contract. A short position can also be achieved through certain types of swap, such as a contract for difference. This is an agreement between two parties to pay each other the difference if the price of an asset rises or falls, under which the party that will benefit if the price falls will have a short position.

Because a short seller can incur a liability to the lender if the price rises, and because a short sale is normally done through a stockbroker, a short seller is typically required to post margin to its broker as collateral to ensure that any such liabilities can be met, and to post additional margin if losses begin to accrue. For analogous reasons, short positions in derivatives also usually involve the posting of margin with the counterparty. Any failure to post margin promptly would prompt the broker or counterparty to close the position.

Short selling is a common practice in public securities, futures, and currency markets that are fungible and reasonably liquid.

A short sale may have a variety of objectives. Speculators may sell short hoping to realize a profit on an instrument that appears overvalued, just as long investors or speculators hope to profit from a rise in the price of an instrument that appears undervalued. Alternatively, traders or fund managers may use offsetting short positions to hedge certain risks that exist in a long position or a portfolio.

Research indicates that banning short selling is ineffective and has negative effects on markets. Nevertheless, short selling is subject to criticism and periodically faces hostility from society and policymakers.

== Concept ==
=== Physical shorting with borrowed securities ===

To profit from a decrease in the price of a security, a short seller can borrow the security and sell it, expecting that it will be cheaper to repurchase in the future. When the seller decides that the time is right (or when the lender recalls the securities), the seller buys the same number of equivalent securities and returns them to the lender. The act of buying back the securities that were sold short is called covering the short, covering the position or simply covering. A short position can be covered at any time before the securities are due to be returned. Once the position is covered, the short seller is not affected by subsequent rises or falls in the price of the securities, for it already holds the securities that it will return to the lender.

The process relies on the fact that the securities (or the other assets being sold short) are fungible. An investor therefore &quot;borrows&quot; securities in the same sense as one borrows a $10 bill, where the legal ownership of the money is transferred to the borrower and it can be freely disposed of, and different bank notes or coins can be returned to the lender. This can be contrasted with the sense in which one borrows a bicycle, where the ownership of the bicycle does not change and the same bicycle must be returned, not merely one that is the same model.

Because the price of a share is theoretically unlimited, the potential losses of a short-seller are also theoretically unlimited.

==== Worked example of a profitable short sale ====
Shares in ACME Inc. currently trade at $10 per share.

# A short seller borrows from a lender 100 shares of ACME Inc., and immediately sells them for a total of $1,000.
# Subsequently, the price of the shares falls to $8 per share.
# Short seller now buys 100 shares of ACME Inc. for $800.
# Short seller returns the shares to the lender, who must accept the return of the same number of shares as was lent despite the fact that the market value of the shares has decreased.
# Short seller keeps as its profit the $200 difference between the price at which the short seller sold the borrowed shares and the lower price at which the short seller purchased the equivalent shares (minus borrowing fees paid to the lender).

==== Worked example of a loss-making short sale ====
Shares in ACME Inc. currently trade at $10 per share.

# A short seller borrows 100 shares of ACME Inc., and sells them for a total of $1,000.
# Subsequently, the price of the shares rises to $25 per share.
# Short seller is required to return the shares, and is compelled to buy 100 shares of ACME Inc. for $2,500.
# Short seller returns the shares to the lender, who accepts the return of the same number of shares as was lent.
# Short seller incurs as a loss the $1,500 difference between the price at which they sold the borrowed shares and the higher price at which the short seller had to purchase the equivalent shares (plus any borrowing fees).

=== Synthetic shorting with derivatives ===
&quot;Shorting&quot; or &quot;going short&quot; (and sometimes also &quot;short selling&quot;) also refer more broadly to any transaction used by an investor to profit from the decline in price of a borrowed asset or financial instrument. Derivatives contracts that can be used in this way include futures, options, and swaps. These contracts are typically cash-settled, meaning that no buying or selling of the asset in question is actually involved in the contract, although typically one side of the contract will be a broker that will effect a back-to-back sale of the asset in question in order to hedge their position.

== History ==
The practice of short selling was likely invented in 1609 by Dutch businessman Isaac Le Maire, a sizeable shareholder of the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie or VOC in Dutch). Short selling can exert downward pressure on the underlying stock, driving down the price of shares of that security. This, combined with the seemingly complex and hard-to-follow tactics of the practice, has made short selling a historical target for criticism. At various times in history, governments have restricted or banned short selling.

The London banking house of Neal, James, Fordyce and Down collapsed in June 1772, precipitating a major crisis that included the collapse of almost every private bank in Scotland, and a liquidity crisis in the two major banking centres of the world, London and Amsterdam. The bank had been speculating by shorting East India Company stock on a massive scale, and apparently using customer deposits to cover losses. In another well-referenced example, George Soros became notorious for &quot;breaking the Bank of England&quot; on Black Wednesday of 1992, when he sold short more than $10 billion worth of pounds sterling.

The term &quot;short&quot; was in use from at least the mid-nineteenth century. It is commonly understood that the word &quot;short&quot; (i.e. &#x27;lacking&#x27;) is used because the short seller is in a deficit position with his brokerage house. Jacob Little, known as &quot;The Great Bear of Wall Street&quot;, began shorting stocks in the United States in 1822.

Short sellers were blamed for the Wall Street crash of 1929. Regulations governing short selling were implemented in the United States in 1929 and in 1940. Political fallout from the 1929 crash led Congress to enact a law banning short sellers from selling shares during a downtick; this was known as the uptick rule and was in effect until 3 July 2007, when it was removed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC Release No. 34-55970). President Herbert Hoover condemned short sellers and even J. Edgar Hoover said he would investigate short sellers for their role in prolonging the Depression. A few years later, in 1949, Alfred Winslow Jones founded a fund (that was unregulated) that bought stocks while selling other stocks short, hence hedging some of the market risk, and the hedge fund was born.

Negative news, such as litigation against a company, may also entice professional traders to sell the stock short in hope of the stock price going down.

During the dot-com bubble, shorting a start-up company could backfire since it could be taken over at a price higher than the price at which speculators shorted; short-sellers were forced to cover their positions at acquisition prices, while in many cases the firm often overpaid for the start-up.

=== Naked short selling restrictions ===
During the 2008 financial crisis, critics argued that investors taking large short positions in struggling financial firms like Lehman Brothers, HBOS and Morgan Stanley created instability in the stock market and placed additional downward pressure on prices. In response, a number of countries introduced restrictive regulations on short-selling in 2008 and 2009. Naked short selling is the practice of short-selling a tradable asset without first borrowing the security or ensuring that the security can be borrowed – it was this practice that was commonly restricted. Investors argued that it was the weakness of financial institutions, not short-selling, that drove stocks to fall. In September 2008, the Securities Exchange Commission in the United States abruptly banned short sales, primarily in financial stocks, to protect companies under siege in the stock market. That ban expired several weeks later as regulators determined the ban was not stabilizing the price of stocks.

Temporary short-selling bans were also introduced in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and other European countries in 2008 to minimal effect. Australia moved to ban naked short selling entirely in September 2008. Germany placed a ban on naked short selling of certain euro zone securities in 2010. Spain, Portugal and Italy introduced short selling bans in 2011 and again in 2012.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, shorting was severely restricted or temporarily banned, with European market watchdogs tightening the rules on short selling &quot;in an effort to stem the historic losses arising from the coronavirus pandemic&quot;.

Worldwide, economic regulators seem inclined to restrict short selling to decrease potential downward price cascades. Investors continue to argue this only contributes to market inefficiency.

== Mechanism ==

A short seller typically borrows through a broker, who is usually holding the securities for another investor who owns the securities; the broker himself seldom purchases the securities to lend to the short seller. The lender does not lose the right to sell the securities while they have been lent, as the broker usually holds a large pool of such securities for a number of investors which, as such securities are fungible, can instead be transferred to any buyer. In most market conditions there is a ready supply of securities to be borrowed, held by pension funds, mutual funds and other investors.

=== Shorting stock in the U.S. ===
To sell stocks short in the U.S., the seller must arrange for a broker-dealer to confirm that it can deliver the shorted securities. This is referred to as a &quot;locate&quot;. Brokers have a variety of means to borrow stocks to facilitate locates and make good on delivery of the shorted security.

The vast majority of stocks borrowed by U.S. brokers come from loans made by the leading custody banks and fund management companies (see list below). Institutions often lend out their shares to earn extra money on their investments. These institutional loans are usually arranged by the custodian who holds the securities for the institution. In an institutional stock loan, the borrower puts up cash collateral, typically 102% of the value of the stock. The cash collateral is then invested by the lender, who often rebates part of the interest to the borrower. The interest that is kept by the lender is the compensation to the lender for the stock loan.

Brokerage firms can also borrow stocks from the accounts of their own customers. Typical margin account agreements give brokerage firms the right to borrow customer shares without notifying the customer. In general, brokerage accounts are only allowed to lend shares from accounts for which customers have &quot;debit balances&quot;, meaning they have borrowed from the account. SEC Rule 15c3-3 imposes such severe restrictions on the lending of shares from cash accounts or excess margin (fully paid for) shares from margin accounts that most brokerage firms do not bother except in rare circumstances. (These restrictions include that the broker must have the express permission of the customer and provide collateral or a letter of credit.)

Most brokers allow retail customers to borrow shares to short a stock only if one of their own customers has purchased the stock on margin. Brokers go through the &quot;locate&quot; process outside their own firm to obtain borrowed shares from other brokers only for their large institutional customers.

Stock exchanges such as the NYSE or the NASDAQ typically report the &quot;short interest&quot; of a stock, which gives the number of shares that have been &quot;legally&quot; sold short as a percent of the total float. Alternatively, these can also be expressed as the short interest ratio, which is the number of shares &quot;legally&quot; sold short as a multiple of the average daily volume. These can be useful tools to spot trends in stock price movements but for them to be reliable, investors must also ascertain the number of shares brought into existence by naked shorters. Speculators are cautioned to remember that for every share that has been shorted (owned by a new owner), a &#x27;shadow owner&#x27; exists (i.e., the original owner) who also is part of the universe of owners of that stock, i.e., despite having no voting rights, he has not relinquished his interest and some rights in that stock.

=== Securities lending ===
When a security is sold, the seller is contractually obliged to deliver it to the buyer. If a seller sells a security short without owning it first, the seller must borrow the security from a third party to fulfill its obligation. Otherwise, the seller &quot;fails to deliver,&quot; the transaction does not settle, and the seller may be subject to a claim from its counterparty. Certain large holders of securities, such as a custodian or investment management firm, often lend out these securities to gain extra income, a process known as securities lending. The lender receives a fee for this service. Similarly, retail investors can sometimes make an extra fee when their broker wants to borrow their securities. This is only possible when the investor has full title of the security, so it cannot be used as collateral for margin buying.

=== Sources of short interest data ===
Time delayed short interest data (for &quot;legally&quot; shorted shares) is available in a number of countries, including the US, the UK, Hong Kong, and Spain. The number of stocks being shorted on a global basis has increased in recent years for various structural reasons (e.g., the growth of 130/30 type strategies, short or bear ETFs). The data is typically delayed; for example, the NASDAQ requires its broker-dealer member firms to report data on the 15th of each month, and then publishes a compilation eight days later.

Some market data providers (like Data Explorers and SunGard Financial Systems) believe that stock lending data provides a good proxy for short interest levels (excluding any naked short interest). SunGard provides daily data on short interest by tracking the proxy variables based on borrowing and lending data it collects.

=== Short selling terms ===
Days to Cover (DTC) is the relationship between the number of shares in a given equity that has been &quot;legally&quot; short-sold and the number of days of typical trading that it would require to &#x27;cover&#x27; all legal short positions outstanding. For example, if there are ten million shares of XYZ Inc. that are currently legally short-sold and the average daily volume of XYZ shares traded each day is one million, it would require ten days of average trading for all legal short positions to be covered (10 million / 1 million).

Short Interest relates the number of shares in a given equity that have been legally shorted divided by the total shares outstanding for the company, usually expressed as a percent. For example, if there are ten million shares of XYZ Inc. that are currently legally short-sold, and the total number of shares issued by the company is one hundred million, the Short Interest is 10% (10 million / 100 million). If, however, shares are being created through naked short selling, &quot;fails&quot; data must be accessed to assess accurately the true level of short interest.

Borrow cost is the fee paid to a securities lender for borrowing the stock or other security. The cost of borrowing the stock is usually negligible compared to fees paid and interest accrued on the margin account – in 2002, 91% of stocks could be shorted for less than a 1% fee per annum, generally lower than interest rates earned on the margin account. However, certain stocks become &quot;hard to borrow&quot; as stockholders willing to lend their stock become more difficult to locate. The cost of borrowing these stocks can become significant – in February 2001, the cost to borrow (short) Krispy Kreme stock reached an annualized 55%, indicating that a short seller would need to pay the lender more than half the price of the stock over the course of the year, essentially as interest for borrowing a stock in limited supply. This has important implications for derivatives pricing and strategy, for the borrow cost itself can become a significant convenience yield for holding the stock (similar to additional dividend) – for instance, put–call parity relationships are broken and the early exercise feature of American call options on non-dividend paying stocks can become rational to exercise early, which otherwise would not be economical.

=== Naked short selling ===

A naked short sale occurs when a security is sold short without borrowing the security within a set time (for example, three days in the US.) This means that the buyer of such a short is buying the short-seller&#x27;s promise to deliver a share, rather than buying the share itself. The short-seller&#x27;s promise is known as a hypothecated share.

When the holder of the underlying stock receives a dividend, the holder of the hypothecated share would receive an equal dividend from the short seller.

Naked shorting has been made illegal except where allowed under limited circumstances by market makers. It is detected by the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (in the US) as a &quot;failure to deliver&quot; or simply &quot;fail.&quot; While many fails are settled in a short time, some have been allowed to linger in the system.

In the US, arranging to borrow a security before a short sale is called a &quot;locate&quot;. In 2005, to prevent widespread failure to deliver securities, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) put in place Regulation SHO, intended to prevent speculators from selling some stocks short before doing a locate. More stringent rules were put in place in September 2008, ostensibly to prevent the practice from exacerbating market declines. These rules were made permanent in 2009.

== Fees ==

When a broker facilitates the delivery of a client&#x27;s short sale, the client is charged a fee for this service, usually a standard commission similar to that of purchasing a similar security.

If the short position begins to move against the holder of the short position (i.e., the price of the security begins to rise), money is removed from the holder&#x27;s cash balance and moved to their margin balance. If short shares continue to rise in price, and the holder does not have sufficient funds in the cash account to cover the position, the holder begins to borrow on margin for this purpose, thereby accruing margin interest charges. These are computed and charged just as for any other margin debit. Therefore, only margin accounts can be used to open a short position.

When a security&#x27;s ex-dividend date passes, the dividend is deducted from the shortholder&#x27;s account and paid to the person from whom the stock is borrowed.

For some brokers, the short seller may not earn interest on the proceeds of the short sale or use it to reduce outstanding margin debt. These brokers may not pass this benefit on to the retail client unless the client is very large. The interest is often split with the lender of the security.

== Dividends and voting rights ==
Where shares have been shorted and the company that issues the shares distributes a dividend, the question arises as to who receives the dividend. The new buyer of the shares, who is the &quot;holder of record&quot; and holds the shares outright, receives the dividend from the company. However, the lender, who may hold its shares in a margin account with a prime broker and is unlikely to be aware that these particular shares are being lent out for shorting, also expects to receive a dividend. The short seller therefore pays the lender an amount equal to the dividend to compensate—though technically, as this payment does not come from the company, it is not a dividend. The short seller is therefore said to be &quot;short the dividend&quot;.

A similar issue comes up with the voting rights attached to the shorted shares. Unlike a dividend, voting rights cannot legally be synthesized and so the buyer of the shorted share, as the holder of record, controls the voting rights. The owner of a margin account from which the shares were lent agreed in advance to relinquish voting rights to shares during the period of any short sale.

As noted earlier, victims of naked shorting sometimes report that the number of votes cast is greater than the number of shares issued by the company.

== Markets ==

Transactions in financial derivatives such as options and futures have the same name but have different overlaps, one notable overlap is having an equal &quot;negative&quot; amount in the position. However, the practice of a short position in derivatives is completely different. Derivatives are contracts between two parties, a buyer and seller. Each trade results in a &quot;long&quot; (buyer&#x27;s position) and a &quot;short&quot; (seller&#x27;s position).

=== Futures and options contracts ===
When trading futures contracts, being &#x27;short&#x27; means having the legal obligation to deliver something at the expiration of the contract, although the holder of the short position may alternately buy back the contract prior to expiration instead of making delivery. Short futures transactions are often used by producers of a commodity to fix the future price of goods they have not yet produced. Shorting a futures contract is sometimes also used by those holding the underlying asset (i.e. those with a long position) as a temporary hedge against price declines. Shorting futures may also be used for speculative trades, in which case the investor is looking to profit from any decline in the price of the futures contract prior to expiration.

An investor can also purchase a put option, giving that investor the right (but not the obligation) to sell the underlying asset (such as shares of stock) at a fixed price. In the event of a market decline, the option holder may exercise these put options, obliging the counterparty to buy the underlying asset at the agreed upon (or &quot;strike&quot;) price, which would then be higher than the current quoted spot price of the asset.

=== Currency ===
Selling short on the currency markets is different from selling short on the stock markets. Currencies are traded in pairs, each currency being priced in terms of another. In this way, selling short on the currency markets is identical to going long on stocks.

Novice traders or stock traders can be confused by the failure to recognize and understand this point: a contract is always long in terms of one medium and short another.

When the exchange rate has changed, the trader buys the first currency again; this time he gets more of it, and pays back the loan. Since he got more money than he had borrowed initially, he makes money. The reverse can also occur.

An example of this is as follows: Let us say a trader wants to trade with the US dollar and the Indian rupee currencies. Assume that the current market rate is US$1 to Rs. 50 and the trader borrows Rs. 100. With this, he buys US$2. If the next day, the conversion rate becomes US$1 to Rs. 51, then the trader sells his US$2 and gets Rs. 102. He returns Rs. 100 and keeps the Rs. 2 profit (minus fees).

One may also take a short position in a currency using futures or options; the preceding method is used to bet on the spot price, which is more directly analogous to selling a stock short.

== Risks ==

Note: this section does not apply to currency markets.

Short selling is sometimes referred to as a &quot;negative income investment strategy&quot; because there is no potential for dividend income or interest income. Stock is held only long enough to be sold pursuant to the contract, and one&#x27;s return is therefore limited to short term capital gains, which are taxed as ordinary income. For this reason, buying shares (called &quot;going long&quot;) has a very different risk profile from selling short. Furthermore, a &quot;long&#x27;s&quot; losses are limited because the price can only go down to zero, but gains are not, as there is no limit, in theory, on how high the price can go. On the other hand, the short seller&#x27;s possible gains are limited to the original price of the stock, which can only go down to zero, whereas the loss potential, again in theory, has no limit. For this reason, short selling probably is most often used as a hedge strategy to manage the risks of long investments.

Many short sellers place a &quot;stop order&quot; with their stockbroker after selling a stock short—an order to the brokerage to cover the position if the price of the stock should rise to a certain level. This is to limit the loss and avoid the problem of unlimited liability described above. In some cases, if the stock&#x27;s price skyrockets, the stockbroker may decide to cover the short seller&#x27;s position immediately and without his consent to guarantee that the short seller can make good on his debt of shares.

Short sellers must be aware of the potential for a short squeeze. When the price of a stock rises significantly, some people who are shorting the stock cover their positions to limit their losses (this may occur in an automated way if the short sellers had stop-loss orders in place with their brokers); others may be forced to close their position to meet a margin call; others may be forced to cover, subject to the terms under which they borrowed the stock, if the person who lent the stock wishes to sell and take a profit. Since covering their positions involves buying shares, the short squeeze causes an ever further rise in the stock&#x27;s price, which in turn may trigger additional covering. Because of this, most short sellers restrict their activities to heavily traded stocks, and they keep an eye on the &quot;short interest&quot; levels of their short investments. Short interest is defined as the total number of shares that have been &quot;legally&quot; sold short, but not covered. A short squeeze can be deliberately induced. This can happen when large investors (such as companies or wealthy individuals) notice significant short positions, and buy many shares, with the intent of selling the position at a profit to the short sellers, who may be panicked by the initial uptick or who are forced to cover their short positions to avoid margin calls.

Another risk is that a given stock may become &quot;hard to borrow&quot;. As defined by the SEC and based on lack of availability, a broker may charge a hard to borrow fee daily, without notice, for any day that the SEC declares a share is hard to borrow. Additionally, a broker may be required to cover a short seller&#x27;s position at any time (&quot;buy in&quot;). The short seller receives a warning from the broker that he is &quot;failing to deliver&quot; stock, which leads to the buy-in.

Because short sellers must eventually deliver the shorted securities to their broker, and need money to buy them, there is a credit risk for the broker. The penalties for failure to deliver on a short selling contract inspired financier Daniel Drew to warn: &quot;He who sells what isn&#x27;t his&#x27;n, Must buy it back or go to pris&#x27;n.&quot; To manage its own risk, the broker requires the short seller to keep a margin account, and charges interest of between 2% and 8% depending on the amounts involved.

In 2011, the eruption of the massive China stock frauds on North American equity markets brought a related risk to light for the short seller. The efforts of research-oriented short sellers to expose these frauds eventually prompted NASDAQ, NYSE and other exchanges to impose sudden, lengthy trading halts that froze the values of shorted stocks at artificially high values. Reportedly in some instances, brokers charged short sellers excessively large amounts of interest based on these high values as the shorts were forced to continue their borrowings at least until the halts were lifted.

Short sellers tend to temper overvaluation by selling into exuberance. Likewise, short sellers are said to provide price support by buying when negative sentiment is exacerbated after a significant price decline. Short selling can have negative implications if it causes a premature or unjustified share price collapse when the fear of cancellation due to bankruptcy becomes contagious.

== Strategies ==

=== Hedging ===
Hedging often represents a means of minimizing the risk from a more complex set of transactions.
Examples of this are:
* A farmer who has just planted their wheat wants to lock in the price at which they can sell after the harvest. The farmer would take a short position in wheat futures.
* A market maker in corporate bonds is constantly trading bonds when clients want to buy or sell. This can create substantial bond positions. The largest risk is that interest rates overall move. The trader can hedge this risk by selling government bonds short against his long positions in corporate bonds. In this way, the risk that remains is credit risk of the corporate bonds.
* An options trader may short shares to remain delta neutral so that they are not exposed to risk from price movements in the stocks that underlie their options.

=== Arbitrage ===

A short seller may be trying to benefit from market inefficiencies arising from the mispricing of certain products. Examples of this are
* An arbitrageur who buys long futures contracts on a US Treasury security, and sells short the underlying US Treasury security.

=== Against the box ===
One variant of selling short involves a long position. &quot;Selling short against the box&quot; consists of holding a long position on which the shares have already risen, whereupon one then enters a short sell order for an equal number of shares. The term &quot;box&quot; alludes to the days when a safe deposit box was used to store (long) shares. The purpose of this technique is to lock in paper profits on the long position without having to sell that position (and possibly incur taxes if said position has appreciated). Once the short position has been entered, it serves to balance the long position taken earlier. Thus, from that point in time, the profit is locked in (less brokerage fees and short financing costs), regardless of further fluctuations in the underlying share price. For example, one can ensure a profit in this way, while delaying sale until the subsequent tax year.

U.S. investors considering entering into a &quot;short against the box&quot; transaction should be aware of the tax consequences of this transaction. Unless certain conditions are met, the IRS deems a &quot;short against the box&quot; position to be a &quot;constructive sale&quot; of the long position, which is a taxable event. These conditions include a requirement that the short position be closed out within 30 days of the end of the year and that the investor must hold their long position, without entering into any hedging strategies, for a minimum of 60 days after the short position has been closed.

== Regulations ==

=== United States ===
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 gave the Securities and Exchange Commission the power to regulate short sales. The first official restriction on short selling came in 1938, when the SEC adopted a rule (known as the uptick rule) that a short sale could only be made when the price of a particular stock was higher than the previous trade price. The uptick rule aimed to prevent short sales from causing or exacerbating market price declines. In January 2005, The Securities and Exchange Commission enacted Regulation SHO to target abusive naked short selling. Regulation SHO was the SEC&#x27;s first update to short selling restrictions since the uptick rule in 1938.

The regulation contains two key components: the &quot;locate&quot; and the &quot;close-out&quot;. The locate component attempts to reduce failure to deliver securities by requiring a broker possess or have arranged to possess borrowed shares. The close out component requires that a broker be able to deliver the shares that are to be shorted. In the US, initial public offers (IPOs) cannot be sold short for a month after they start trading. This mechanism is in place to ensure a degree of price stability during a company&#x27;s initial trading period. However, some brokerage firms that specialize in penny stocks (referred to colloquially as bucket shops) have used the lack of short selling during this month to pump and dump thinly traded IPOs. Canada and other countries do allow selling IPOs (including U.S. IPOs) short.

The Securities and Exchange Commission initiated a temporary ban on short selling of 799 financial stocks from 19 September 2008 until 2 October 2008. Greater penalties for naked shorting, by mandating delivery of stocks at clearing time, were also introduced. Some state governors have been urging state pension bodies to refrain from lending stock for shorting purposes. An assessment of the effect of the temporary ban on short-selling in the United States and other countries in the wake of the financial crisis showed that it had only &quot;little impact&quot; on the movements of stocks, with stock prices moving in the same way as they would have moved anyhow, but the ban reduced volume and liquidity.

=== Europe, Australia and China ===
In the UK, the Financial Services Authority had a moratorium on short selling of 29 leading financial stocks, effective from 2300 GMT on 19 September 2008 until 16 January 2009. After the ban was lifted, John McFall, chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, House of Commons, made clear in public statements and a letter to the FSA that he believed it ought to be extended. Between 19 and 21 September 2008, Australia temporarily banned short selling, and later placed an indefinite ban on naked short selling. Australia&#x27;s ban on short selling was further extended for another 28 days on 21 October 2008. Also during September 2008, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and Canada banned short selling of leading financial stocks, and France, the Netherlands and Belgium banned naked short selling of leading financial stocks. By contrast with the approach taken by other countries, Chinese regulators responded by allowing short selling, along with a package of other market reforms. Short selling was completely allowed on 31 March 2010, limited to &quot; for large blue chip stocks with good earnings performance and little price volatility.&quot; However, in 2015, short selling was effectively banned due to legislative restrictions on borrowing stocks following the stock market crash the same year.

== Views of short selling ==
Advocates of short selling argue that the practice is an essential part of the price discovery mechanism. Financial researchers at Duke University said in a study that short interest is an indicator of poor future stock performance (the self-fulfilling aspect) and that short sellers exploit market mistakes about firms&#x27; fundamentals.

Such noted investors as Seth Klarman and Warren Buffett have said that short sellers help the market. Klarman argued that short sellers are a useful counterweight to the widespread bullishness on Wall Street, while Buffett believes that short sellers are useful in uncovering fraudulent accounting and other problems at companies.

Shortseller James Chanos received widespread publicity when he was an early critic of the accounting practices of Enron. Chanos responds to critics of short-selling by pointing to the critical role they played in identifying problems at Enron, Boston Market and other &quot;financial disasters&quot; over the years. In 2011, research oriented short sellers were widely acknowledged for exposing the China stock frauds.

Short selling and hedge fund advocate Bryan Corbett, CEO of Managed Funds Association argued that over-regulation of short selling could expose investors&#x27; strategies, which could harm market investors, market participants, and market efficiency.

Commentator Jim Cramer has expressed concern about short selling and started a petition calling for the reintroduction of the uptick rule. Books like &quot;Don&#x27;t Blame the Shorts&quot; by Robert Sloan and &quot;Fubarnomics&quot; by Robert E. Wright suggest Cramer exaggerated the costs of short selling and underestimated the benefits, which may include the ex ante identification of asset bubbles.

Individual short sellers have been subject to criticism and even litigation. Manuel P. Asensio, for example, engaged in a lengthy legal battle with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Hemispherx Biopharma.

Several studies of the effectiveness of short selling bans indicate that short selling bans do not contribute to more moderate market dynamics.

<doc id="113522" wikidata="Q391980" url="?curid=113522" title="Free Territory of Trieste">
<text>The Free Territory of Trieste was an independent territory in Southern Europe between Northern Italy and Yugoslavia, facing the north part of the Adriatic Sea, under direct responsibility of the United Nations Security Council in the aftermath of World War II. For a period of seven years, it acted as a free city.

The territory was established on 10 February 1947, by a protocol of the Treaty of Peace with Italy, to accommodate an ethnically and culturally mixed population in a neutral independent country. The intention was also to cool down territorial claims between Italy and Yugoslavia, due to its strategic importance for trade with Central Europe. It came into existence on 15 September 1947. Its administration was divided into two areas: one being the port city of Trieste with a narrow coastal strip to the northwest (Zone A); the other (Zone B) was formed by a small portion of the north-western part of the Istrian peninsula.

The territory was &quot;de facto&quot; dissolved in 1954 and given to Italy (Zone A) and Yugoslavia (Zone B). This created a border dispute which was only settled twenty years later with the signing of the bilateral Treaty of Osimo in 1975, which was ratified in 1977. 

The city of Trieste and the territory which formed Zone A is today part of Italy&#x27;s Friuli-Venezia Giulia region. Following the dissolution of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, the area of the former Zone B is today part of Slovenia and Croatia.

== Geography ==
The Free Territory of Trieste comprised an area of around the Gulf of Trieste in the northern Adriatic, from Duino (Devin) in the north to Cittanova (Novigrad) in the south, and had approximately 330,000 inhabitants. 

It bordered post-war Italy to the north, and Yugoslavia to the east and south. The rivers of the territory included the Rižana/Risano, the Dragonja/Dragogna, the Timavo/Timava, the Val Rosandra/Glinščica, and the Mirna/Quieto. The Territory&#x27;s highest point was at Monte Cocusso/Kokoš (). Its most extreme points were near Medeazza/Medjavas at 45° 48’ in the north, at Tarski Zaliv / Porto Quieto at 45° 18’ in the south, Savudrija / Punta Salvore at 13° 29’ in the west, and Gročana/Grozzana at 13° 55’ in the east.

==History==

Since 1382, Trieste had been part of the Habsburg monarchy, whilst neighboring Istria had been divided for centuries between the Habsburg monarchy (its central, northern and eastern parts) and the Republic of Venice (its western and southern parts). The population of the territory has been diverse and mixed, with different and often changing ethnic majorities in different parts of the territory.

Italian-speakers have been predominant in most urban settlements and along the coast, with significant ethnic Slavic minorities of Slovenes and Croats inland - especially in the Trieste district, where Slovenes represented a third of the population by the end of World War I (although most of them were recent arrivals, after 1880, from interior Slovene districts). The countryside of the territory was mostly populated by ethnic Slovenes or Croats in the southernmost portion of the area. There was also a smaller number of Istro-Romanians, Greeks, Albanians, as well as a sizeable Triestine Jewish community.

The local Triestine dialect reflects this ethnic mix. Based on the Romance Venetian language, the dialect was influenced by ancient Rhaeto-Romance substrate. In addition, some Triestine vocabulary are of German and Slovene origin, and there are also loanwords from other languages, such as Greek.

The variations of spoken Slovenian and Serbo-Croatian in the territory were also largely dialectal, sharing words with the Triestine and Istrian dialects. In the southernmost part of the territory, the Croatian-based dialects are of the Chakavian type, while the Venetian-based Istrian is also commonly used.
At the end of World War I in 1918 and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, Kingdom of Italy annexed Trieste, Istria and part of modern-day western Slovenia, establishing the border region known as the Julian March (Venezia Giulia). In 1924, Italy also annexed the Free State of Fiume (now the city of Rijeka in Croatia).

During the 1920s and 1930s, the Slavic population was subject to forced Italianization and discrimination under the Italian Fascist regime led by Benito Mussolini. They were also exposed to state violence by mobs incited by the ruling fascist party PNF, which included the infamous burning of the Slovene National Hall in Trieste on 13 July 1920. Because of this, some native Slovenes and Croats emigrated to Yugoslavia, while others joined the TIGR resistance organization, whose methods included more than 100 bombings and assassinations, mostly against Italian authorities in the region, and especially in the areas around Trieste and Gorizia to the north.

===World War II===

Beginning in 1940, Italy joined World War II alongside Nazi Germany as one of the Axis powers. When the Fascist regime collapsed and Italy capitulated with the Armistice of Cassibile in September 1943, the territory in and around Trieste was occupied by the German Wehrmacht armed forces, which made the city the capital of their regional Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral (OZAK). 

Amid the collapse of German front line towards the end of the war, Yugoslav Partisan units (4th Army and the 9th Corps) entered Trieste on 1 May 1945, after a battle in the town of Opicina on the outskirts of Trieste. 

The 2nd New Zealand Division also arrived the following day, and forced the surrender of some 2,000 German troops holding out in Trieste, who warily had refused to capitulate to Yugoslav troops, fearing reprisals and executions. An uneasy truce then developed between New Zealand and Yugoslav troops occupying the area, until British General William Morgan proposed partition of the territory into separate military-administered zones.

Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito agreed with the idea on 23 May, as the British 13th Corps was moving forward to the proposed demarcation line. A formal agreement on partition was signed in Duino on 10 June, which created the so-called Morgan Line dividing the Julian March territory. Yugoslav troops withdrew to their area on 12 June 1945.

===Establishment of the territory and provisional government===

In January 1947, the United Nations Security Council approved Resolution 16 under Article 24 of its charter calling for the creation of a free state in Trieste and the region surrounding it. A permanent statute codifying its provisions was to become recognized under international law upon the appointment of an international governor approved by the Quatripartite Powers (UK, US, France, and the Soviet Union). On 15 September 1947, the peace treaty between the United Nations (UN) and Italy was ratified, establishing the Free Territory of Trieste. 

Official languages were Italian and Slovene, possibly with the use of Serbo-Croatian in the portion of Zone B south of the Dragonja River. However, local government bodies were never formed, and it continued to be run by military authorities, respecting the administrative division demarcated by the Morgan Line: Zone A, which was and had a population of 262,406 - including Trieste itself - was administered by the British and American forces; Zone B, which was with 71,000 residents - including north-western Istria - was administered by the Yugoslav army.
Between October 1947 and March 1948, the Soviet Union rejected the candidacy of 12 successive nominees for the civilian governor of the territory, at which point the Tripartite Powers (United States, United Kingdom, and France) issued a note to the Soviet and Yugoslav governments on 20 March 1948 recommending that the territory be returned to Italian sovereignty. 

Since no governor was ever appointed under the terms of UN Resolution 16, the Territory never functioned as a real independent state – although its formal status and separate sovereignty were generally respected. It operated as a separate state in the Marshall Plan (launched in April 1948) and the related OEEC (formed in March 1948). Meanwhile, the Tito-Stalin split in mid-1948 led to the deterioration of relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, which resulted in a political stalemate, and the proposal to return the territory to Italy was suspended until 1954.

The Allied Military Government (AMG) thus continued to administer Zone A. The governance was split into peacekeeping and law enforcement sectors, with the local command comprising 5,000 Americans in the Trieste United States Troops (TRUST) and 5,000 British personnel in the British Element Trieste Forces (BETFOR).

According to the estimates published by the Allied Military Government, the population in Zone A as of 1949 was about 310,000, which included 239,200 ethnic Italians and 63,000 ethnic Slovenes. 

According to contemporary Italian sources, in Zone B there were at the time 36,000 to 55,000 Italians and 12,000 to 17,000 Slovenes and Croats. According to the Yugoslav census of 1945 (which was considered falsified by the Quadripartite Commission set up by the UN), in the part of Istria which was to become Zone B there were a total of 67,461 inhabitants - including 30,789 Slovenes, Serbs and Croats, 29,672 Italians, and 7,000 people of unidentified nationality.

Elections in the Territory were held twice, in 1949 and 1952, but only for municipal councils. The elections for what was supposed to be the People&#x27;s Assembly (Free Territory of Trieste&#x27;s national legislature) were never held.

===Dissolution===
On 5 October 1954, the London Memorandum was signed by ministers of the United States, United Kingdom, Italy, and Yugoslavia. The memorandum effectively disestablished the Free Territory of Trieste, which meant that the civilian administration was formally transferred to neighboring Italy and Yugoslavia. 

Most of Zone A, including Trieste, was given to Italy, while Zone B – which already had a separate communist civilian government since 1947 – was given to Yugoslavia. In addition, Yugoslavia received several villages of Zone A in the municipalities of Muggia and San Dorligo della Valle, such as Plavje, Spodnje Škofije, Elerji, Hrvatini, Kolomban, Cerej, Premančan, Barizoni, and Socerb (with its castle), according to the demarcation line defined by Annex I.

However, objections to the demarcation line and territorial claims from both sides continued. These were finally put to rest with the November 1975 signing of the bilateral Treaty of Osimo between Italy and Yugoslavia, which ended any current or future claims - as the London Memorandum had only dissolved the territory &quot;de facto&quot;, but not &quot;de jure&quot;.

==Economics==
The economy of the territory was based on its ports, namely the Free Port of Trieste and the Port of Koper/Capodistria. The first had a peculiar free zone (nowadays also offshore) status originated in 1719 and confirmed by the Treaty of Peace with Italy of 1947, which allows the transportation of goods inside the area.
This status is recognised by the international community and the European Union.

An excerpt from the answer given by Algirdas Šemeta on 7 August 2012, on behalf of the European Commission about the Free Port of Trieste:
Annex VIII to the Treaty of peace with Italy of 10 February 1947 stipulates in its Article 1 that the port of Trieste shall be a customs-free port. Article 5(2) of Annex VIII provides that in connection with the importation into or exportation from or transit through the Free Port, &quot;the authorities of the Free Territory shall not levy on such goods customs duties or charges other than those levied for services rendered&quot;. [emphasis added]

== Demographics ==
During the late 1940s and in the years following the division of the territory, up to 40,000 people (mostly Italians) chose to leave the Yugoslav Zone B and move to the Italian Zone A for various reasons: some were intimidated into leaving, and some simply preferred not to live in Yugoslavia. Within Yugoslavia, the people who left were referred to as &#x27; &#x27;choosers&#x27;, whereas they called themselves &#x27; &#x27;exiles&#x27;. About 14,000 Italians chose to remain in the Yugoslav zone. The population of the Free Territory of Trieste was approximately 370,000 in 1949.

<text>The risk-free rate of return, usually shortened to the risk-free rate, is the rate of return of a hypothetical investment with scheduled payments over a fixed period of time that is assumed to meet all payment obligations.

Since the risk-free rate can be obtained with no risk, any other investment having some risk will have to have a higher rate of return in order to induce any investors to hold it.

In practice, to infer the risk-free interest rate in a particular currency, market participants often choose the yield to maturity on a risk-free bond issued by a government of the same currency whose risks of default are so low as to be negligible. For example, the rate of return on zero-coupon Treasury bonds (T-bills) is sometimes seen as the risk-free rate of return in US dollars.

==Theoretical measurement==
As stated by Malcolm Kemp in chapter five of his book &quot;Market Consistency: Model Calibration in Imperfect Markets&quot;, the risk-free rate means different things to different people and there is no consensus on how to go about a direct measurement of it.

One interpretation of the theoretical risk-free rate is aligned to Irving Fisher&#x27;s concept of inflationary expectations, described in his treatise &quot;The Theory of Interest&quot; (1930), which is based on the theoretical costs and benefits of holding currency. In Fisher&#x27;s model, these are described by two potentially offsetting movements:

# Expected increases in the money supply should result in investors preferring current consumption to future income.
# Expected increases in productivity should result in investors preferring future income to current consumption.

The correct interpretation is that the risk-free rate could be either positive or negative and in practice the sign of the expected risk-free rate is an institutional convention – this is analogous to the argument that Tobin makes on page 17 of his book &quot;Money, Credit and Capital&quot;. In a system with endogenous money creation and where production decisions and outcomes are decentralized and potentially intractable to forecasting, this analysis provides support to the concept that the risk-free rate may not be directly observable.

However, it is commonly observed that for people applying this interpretation, the value of supplying currency is normally perceived as being positive. It is not clear what is the true basis for this perception, but it may be related to the practical necessity of some form of (credit?) currency to support the specialization of labour, the perceived benefits of which were detailed by Adam Smith in &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;. However, Smith did not provide an &#x27;upper limit&#x27; to the desirable level of the specialization of labour and did not fully address issues of how this should be organised at the national or international level.

An alternative (less well developed) interpretation is that the risk-free rate represents the time preference of a representative worker for a representative basket of consumption. Again, there are reasons to believe that in this situation the risk-free rate may not be directly observable.

A third (also less well developed) interpretation is that instead of maintaining pace with purchasing power, a representative investor may require a risk free investment to keep pace with wages.

Given the theoretical &#x27;fog&#x27; around this issue, in practice most industry practitioners rely on some form of proxy for the risk-free rate, or use other forms of benchmark rate which are presupposed to incorporate the risk-free rate plus some risk of default. However, there are also issues with this approach, which are discussed in the next section.

Further discussions on the concept of a &#x27;stochastic discount rate&#x27; are available in &quot;The Econometrics of Financial Markets&quot; by Campbell, Lo and MacKinley.

==Proxies for the risk-free rate==
The return on domestically held short-dated government bonds is normally perceived as a good proxy for the risk-free rate. In business valuation the long-term yield on the US Treasury coupon bonds is generally accepted as the risk-free rate of return. However, theoretically this is only correct if there is no perceived risk of default associated with the bond. Government bonds are conventionally considered to be relatively risk-free to a domestic holder of a government bond, because there is by definition no risk of default – the bond is a form of government obligation which is being discharged through the payment of another form of government obligation (i.e. the domestic currency). In fact, default on government debt does happen, so if in theory this is impossible, then this points out a deficiency of the theory. Another issue with this approach is that with coupon-bearing bonds, the investor does not know ex-ante what his return will be on the reinvested coupons (and hence the return cannot really be considered risk-free).

Some academics support the use of swap rates as a measurement of the risk-free rate. Feldhütter and Lando state that: &quot;the riskless rate is better proxied by the swap rate than the Treasury rate for all maturities.&quot;

There is also the risk of the government &#x27;printing more money&#x27; to meet the obligation, thus paying back in lesser valued currency. This may be perceived as a form of tax, rather than a form of default, a concept similar to that of seigniorage. But the result to the investor is the same, loss of value according to his measurement, so focusing strictly on default does not include all risk.

The same consideration does not necessarily apply to a foreign holder of a government bond, since a foreign holder also requires compensation for potential foreign exchange movements in addition to the compensation required by a domestic holder. Since the risk-free rate should theoretically exclude any risk, default or otherwise, this implies that the yields on foreign owned government debt cannot be used as the basis for calculating the risk-free rate.

Since the required return on government bonds for domestic and foreign holders cannot be distinguished in an international market for government debt, this may mean that yields on government debt are not a good proxy for the risk-free rate.

Another possibility used to estimate the risk-free rate is the inter-bank lending rate. This appears to be premised on the basis that these institutions benefit from an implicit guarantee, underpinned by the role of the monetary authorities as &#x27;the lendor of last resort.&#x27; (In a system with an endogenous money supply the &#x27;monetary authorities&#x27; may be private agents as well as the central bank – refer to Graziani &#x27;The Theory of Monetary Production&#x27;.) Again, the same observation applies to banks as a proxy for the risk-free rate – if there is any perceived risk of default implicit in the interbank lending rate, it is not appropriate to use this rate as a proxy for the risk-free rate.

Similar conclusions can be drawn from other potential benchmark rates, including AAA-rated corporate bonds of institutions deemed &#x27;too big to fail.&#x27;

One solution that has been proposed for solving the issue of not having a good &#x27;proxy&#x27; for the risk-free asset, to provide an &#x27;observable&#x27; risk-free rate is to have some form of international guaranteed asset which would provide a guaranteed return over an indefinite time period (possibly even into perpetuity). There are some assets in existence which might replicate some of the hypothetical properties of this asset. For example, one potential candidate is the &#x27;consol&#x27; bonds which were issued by the British government in the 18th century.

==Application==
The risk-free interest rate is highly significant in the context of the general application of capital asset pricing model which is based on the modern portfolio theory. There are numerous issues with this model, the most basic of which is the reduction of the description of utility of stock holding to the expected mean and variance of the returns of the portfolio. In reality, there may be other utility of stock holding, as described by Robert J. Shiller in his article &#x27;Stock Prices and Social Dynamics&#x27;.

The risk-free rate is also a required input in financial calculations, such as the Black–Scholes formula for pricing stock options and the Sharpe ratio. Note that some finance and economic theories assume that market participants can borrow at the risk-free rate; in practice, very few (if any) borrowers have access to finance at the risk free rate.

The risk-free rate of return is the key input into cost of capital calculations such as those performed using the capital asset pricing model. The cost of capital at risk then is the sum of the risk-free rate of return and certain risk premia.

<doc id="113527" wikidata="Q804943" url="?curid=113527" title="Wang (surname)">
<text>Wang () is the pinyin romanization of the common Chinese surname  (&quot;Wáng&quot;). It has a mixture of various origin with uncertain lineage of family history, however it is currently the most common surname in Mainland China, one of the most common surnames in Asia, with more than 107 million in Asia. It is the 8th name listed in the famous Hundred Family Surnames.

A separate surname  (&quot;Wāng&quot;) is also romanized as Wang.

==Population and distribution==
Wáng is one of the most common surnames in the world and was listed by the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s National Citizen ID Information System as the most common surname in mainland China in April 2007, with 92.88 million bearers and comprising 7.25% of the general population.

A 2018 survey found that there were over 100 million Wang in China, ranking first.

Wáng was also the most common surname in Mainland China in 2019.

A 2013 study found the province with the most people sharing the name was Henan. Overall the name is more prevalent in Northern China. In 2019 it was the most common surname in nearly every northern province or province-level division: Xinjiang, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Hebei, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shandong, Beijing, Tianjin, Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, as well as the southern province of Hainan.

It was the 6th most common surname in Taiwan in 2018, comprising 4.10% of the general population.

Ong is the 5th-most-common surname among Chinese Singaporeans and Wang the 6th, although Wong also includes the surname 黃 (Huang in Mandarin). Singaporean Wangs are 78,000 and 1.5% of Singapore&#x27;s population and 2.5% of Singapore&#x27;s Chinese population.

There are 143,000 recorded Wangs in the United States, as of 2014. This is a double increase from 2000, when 63,800 Wangs ranked 10th most common amongst Asian Americans and 440th amongst all Americans, respectively. There are 51,000 Wangs in California, 17,000 New York, 10,400 Texas, 5,900 New Jersey, 5,700 Illinois. Californian Wangs rank 55th in state, highest in rank as well by state of any state. Wang and Wong are sometimes interchangeable, as well as other Wang-based surnames so the number could vary.

Wang () is a fairly rare surname in South Korea. The year 2000 South Korean Census listed only 23,447 Wangs.

==Origins of Wang==
Wang is the Chinese word for &quot;king&quot;. William Baxter and Laurent Sagart reconstructed the Old Chinese form of Wáng as &quot;&quot; and the Middle Chinese as &quot;hjwang&quot;.

The modern bearers of the name Wang come from many different backgrounds, but there are four principal origins of the modern surname: Zi, Ji, Gui, and the adoption of the name from ethnic groups outside the Han Chinese.

===House of Zi===
The most ancient family name of Wang was originated from the surname Zi (子). The Chinese legend mentions that near the end of Shang dynasty, King Zhou of Shang&#x27;s uncle Bi Gan, Ji Zi, and Wei Zi were called &quot;The Three Kindhearted Men of Shang&quot;. King Zhou was violent in his rule, and Bi Gan repeatedly remonstrated to the king regarding his behavior. The king shunned his comments and killed Bi Gan instead. Bi&#x27;s descendants used Wang as their surname as they are descendants of a prince and were known as &quot;The Bi clan of the Wang family&quot;. The Zi clan has existed for about 3100 years through Qin dynasty to Tang dynasty and exists today. The Zi clan of Wang lived predominantly in modern-day Henan during these times and developed into the famous Wang family of Ji prefecture.

===House of Ji===
More Wang were originated from the royal family of Zhou dynasty. The original surname of the royal family of Zhou dynasty was Ji (姬). However, many of them have separated out of the family due to the loss of power and land. Because they once belonged to the royal family, they used Wang as their surname. This family of Wang traced its ancestry to Wang Ziqiao.

According to the classical records, after King Wu of Zhou defeated the Shang dynasty, he established the Western Zhou dynasty. During the reign of the 21st king, King Ling of Zhou (571 - 545 BCE), the capital was in Chengzhou, which is the present day Luoyang, Henan. A son of King Ling, Wangzi Qiao or Prince Qiao, was reduced to civilian status due to his remonstration to the king. His son Zong Jin remained as a Situ in the palace, and because of the people at the time recognized him as the descendant of the royal family, they called his family the &quot;Wang family&quot;.

Another origin is that the surname is from Crown Prince Jin, son of King Ling of Zhou of the Eastern Zhou dynasty. Jin criticized plans to divert the Gu and Luo rivers and was disinherited by his father. His descendants adopted the surname Wang in commemoration of his royal status.

In other cases, the name can also be traced back to Tian He, who usurped the throne of the Qi in 391 BC. After the annihilation of Qi by Qin in 221 BC, some descendants of nobles of Qi adopted the surname Wang in commemoration of royal ancestry.

Wang was also used as a surname by descendants of royal families in certain other states, like Wei, during the Warring States period.

The surname has also been adopted by some families of minorities like the Ke Yi (可颐) families of the Xianbei during the Northern Wei dynasty.

In some families, this surname is traced back to ancestors who either were endowed with it by an emperor or changed their original surname, claiming royal status.

During the Tang dynasty the Li clan of Zhaojun , the Cui clan of Boling , the Cui clan of Qinghe , the Lu clan of Fanyang , the Zheng clan of Xingyang , the Wang clan of Taiyuan , and the Li clan of Longxi were the seven noble families between whom marriage was banned by law. Moriya Mitsuo wrote a history of the Later Han-Tang period of the Taiyuan Wang. Among the strongest families was the Taiyuan Wang. The prohibition on marriage between the clans issued in 659 by the Gaozong Emperor was flouted by the seven families since a woman of the Boling Cui married a member of the Taiyuan Wang, giving birth to the poet Wang Wei. He was the son of Wang Chulian who in turn was the son of Wang Zhou.

The marriages between the families were performed clandestinely after the prohibition was implemented on the seven families by Gaozong. The Zhou dynasty King Ling&#x27;s son Prince Jin is assumed by most to be the ancestor of the Taiyuan Wang. The Longmen Wang were a cadet line of the Zhou dynasty descended Taiyuan Wang, and Wang Yan and his grandson Wang Tong hailed from his cadet line. Both Buddhist monks and scholars hailed from the Wang family of Taiyuan such as the monk Tanqian. The Wang family of Taiyuan included Wang Huan. Their status as &quot;Seven Great surnames&quot; became known during Gaozong&#x27;s rule. The Taiyuan Wang family produced Wang Jun who served under Emperor Huai of Jin. A Fuzhou-based section of the Taiyuan Wang produced the Buddhist monk Baizhang.

==The surname in other countries==

===East Asia===
====Korea====

The surname Wang has a Goguryeo origin and was the royal surname of Goryeo dynasty which was founded by Wang Geon. It is said that when Goryeo fell, many changed their surname to Jeon (全) / Jeon (田) / Ok (玉) to avoid severe persecution from the succeeding Joseon dynasty. The Kaesong Wang lineage traces its ancestry to the Goryeo rulers.

====Japan====
Ō () is a rare Japanese name, mostly held by those of Chinese descent, such as the baseball player Sadaharu Oh (王貞治), also known as Wang Chen-chih, as well as Go player, Ō Rissei (王立誠).

===Southeast Asia===
====Indonesia====
In Indonesia, the surname is often romanized as &quot;Heng&quot;, &quot;Bong&quot; or &quot;Ong&quot; for people of Hokkien descent, and more commonly as Ong by Chinese Peranakan. In some cases, the meaning of the names were translated into a name that sounds more like the area where these immigrant families settled in such as the surname Suraja, where in this case raja means king in Indonesian and Javanese and Su- is a common prefix within Javanese surnames.

==== Vietnam ====
In Vietnam, the name is rendered Vương (王) meaning King.

===Europe===
====Scandinavia====
Wang is also an unrelated surname in Sweden and Norway. It is a variant spelling of the name Vang which is derived from the Old Norse word &quot;vangr&quot;, meaning field or meadow.

====Germany and Netherlands====
Wang is also a surname in the German and Dutch languages. The name is derived from Middle German &quot;wang&quot;/ Middle Dutch &quot;waenge&quot;, which is literally &quot;cheek&quot;. However, in southern German, its meaning, &quot;grassy slope&quot; or &quot;field of grass&quot;, is similar to the Scandinavian surname.

<doc id="113530" wikidata="Q514050" url="?curid=113530" title="Fen">
<text>A fen is a type of peat-accumulating wetland fed by mineral-rich ground or surface water. It is one of the main types of wetland along with marshes, swamps, and bogs. Bogs and fens, both peat-forming ecosystems, are also known as mires. The unique water chemistry of fens is a result of the ground or surface water input. Typically, this input results in higher mineral concentrations and a more basic pH than found in bogs. As peat accumulates in a fen, groundwater input can be reduced or cut off, making the fen ombrotrophic rather than minerotrophic. In this way, fens can become more acidic and transition to bogs over time.

Fens can be found around the world, but the vast majority are located at the mid to high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. They are dominated by sedges and mosses, particularly graminoids that may be rarely found elsewhere, such as the sedge species &quot;Carex exilis&quot;. Fens are highly biodiverse ecosystems and often serve as habitats for endangered or rare species, with species composition changing with water chemistry. They also play important roles in the cycling of nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus due to the lack of oxygen (anaerobic conditions) in waterlogged organic fen soils.

Fens have historically been converted to agricultural land. Aside from such conversion, fens face a number of other threats, including peat cutting, pollution, invasive species, and nearby disturbances that lower the water table in the fen, such as quarrying. Interrupting the flow of mineral-rich water into a fen changes the water chemistry, which can alter species richness and dry out the peat. Drier peat is more easily decomposed and can even burn.

== Distribution and extent ==
Fens are distributed around the world, but are most frequently found at the mid-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. They are found throughout the temperate zone and boreal regions, but are also present in tundra and in specific environmental conditions in other regions around the world. In the United States, fens are most common in the Midwest and Northeast, but can be found across the country. In Canada, fens are most frequent in the lowlands near Hudson Bay and James Bay, but can also be found across the country. Fens are also spread across the northern latitudes of Eurasia, including Britain and Ireland, as well as Japan, but east-central Europe is especially rich in fens. Further south, fens are much rarer, but do exist under specific conditions. In Africa, fens have been found in the Okavango Delta in Botswana and the highland slopes in Lesotho. Fens can also be found at the colder latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. They are found in New Zealand and southwest Argentina, but the extent is much less than that of the northern latitudes. Locally, fens are most often found at the intersection of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, such as the headwaters of streams and rivers.

It is estimated that there are approximately 1.1 million square kilometers of fens worldwide, but quantifying the extent of fens is difficult. Because wetland definitions vary regionally, not all countries define fens the same way. In addition, wetland data is not always available or of high quality. Fens are also difficult to rigidly delineate and measure, as they are located between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

== Definition ==
Rigidly defining types of wetlands, including fens, is difficult for a number of reasons. First, wetlands are diverse and varied ecosystems that are not easily categorized according to inflexible definitions. They are often described as a transition between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems with characteristics of both. This makes it difficult to delineate the exact extent of a wetland. Second, terms used to describe wetland types vary greatly by region. The term &quot;bayou,&quot; for example, describes a type of wetland, but its use is generally limited to the southern United States. Third, different languages use different terms to describe types of wetlands. For instance, in Russian, there is no equivalent word for the term &quot;swamp&quot; as it is typically used in North America. The result is a large number of wetland classification systems that each define wetlands and wetland types in their own way. However, many classification systems include four broad categories that most wetlands fall into: marsh, swamp, bog, and fen. While classification systems differ on the exact criteria that define a fen, there are common characteristics that describe fens generally and imprecisely. A general definition provided by the textbook &quot;Wetlands&quot; describes a fen as &quot;a peat-accumulating wetland that receives some drainage from surrounding mineral soil and usually supports marsh like vegetation.&quot;

Three examples are presented below to illustrate more specific definitions for the term &quot;fen&quot;.

=== Canadian Wetland Classification System definition ===
In the Canadian Wetland Classification System, fens are defined by six characteristics:

# Peat is present.
# The surface of the wetland is level with the water table. Water flows on the surface and through the subsurface of the wetland.
# The water table fluctuates. It may be at the surface of the wetland or a few centimeters above or below it.
# The wetland receives a significant amount of its water from mineral-rich groundwater or surface water.
# Decomposed sedges or brown moss peat are present.
# The vegetation is predominantly graminoids and shrubs.

=== &quot;Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation&quot; (Keddy) definition ===
In the textbook &quot;Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation&quot;, Paul A. Keddy offers a somewhat simpler definition of a fen as &quot;a wetland that is usually dominated by sedges and grasses rooted in shallow peat, often with considerable groundwater movement, and with pH greater than 6.&quot; This definition differentiates fens from swamps and marshes by the presence of peat.

=== &quot;The Biology of Peatlands&quot; (Rydin) definition ===
In &quot;The Biology of Peatlands&quot; fens are defined by the following criteria:

# The wetland is not flooded by lake or stream water.
# Woody vegetation 2 meters or taller is absent or canopy cover is less than 25%.
# The wetland is minerotrophic (it receives its nutrients from mineral-rich groundwater).

A further distinction is made between open and wooded fens, where open fens have canopy cover less than 10% and wooded fens have 10–25% canopy cover. If tall shrubs or trees dominate, the wetland is instead classified as a wooded bog or swamp forest, depending on other criteria.

== Biogeochemical features ==
=== Hydrological conditions ===
Hydrological conditions, as seen in other wetlands, are a major determinant of fen biota and biogeochemistry. Fen soils are constantly inundated because the water table is at or near the surface. The result is anaerobic (oxygen-free) soils due to the slow rate at which oxygen diffuses into waterlogged soil. Anaerobic soils are ecologically unique because Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is oxygenated, while most terrestrial ecosystems and surface waters are aerobic. The anaerobic conditions found in wetland soils result in reduced, rather than oxidized, soil chemistry.

A hallmark of fens is that a significant portion of their water supply is derived from groundwater (minerotrophy). Because hydrology is the dominant factor in wetlands, the chemistry of the groundwater has an enormous effect on the characteristics of the fen it supplies. Groundwater chemistry, in turn, is largely determined by the geology of the rocks that the groundwater flows through. Thus, the characteristics of a fen, especially its pH, are directly influenced by the type of rocks its groundwater supply contacts. pH is a major factor in determining fen species composition and richness, with more basic fens called &quot;rich&quot; and more acidic fens called &quot;poor.&quot; Rich fens tend to be highly biodiverse and harbor a number of rare or endangered species, and biodiversity tends to decrease as the richness of fen decreases.

Fens tend to be found above rocks that are rich in calcium, such as limestone. When groundwater flows past calcareous (calcium-rich) rocks like limestone (calcium carbonate), a small amount dissolves and is carried to the fen supplied by the groundwater. When calcium carbonate dissolves, it produces bicarbonate and a calcium cation according to the following equilibrium:

&lt;chem&gt;CaCO3 + H2CO3 &lt;=&gt; Ca^2+ + 2HCO3^-&lt;/chem&gt;

where carbonic acid (H2CO3) is produced by the dissolution of carbon dioxide in water. In fens, the bicarbonate anion produced in this equilibrium acts as a pH buffer, which keeps the pH of the fen relatively stable. Fens supplied by groundwater that doesn&#x27;t flow through minerals and act as a buffer when dissolved tend to be more acidic. The same effect is observed when groundwater flows through minerals with low solubility, such as sand.

In extreme rich fens, calcium carbonate can precipitate out of solution to form marl deposits. Calcium carbonate precipitates out of solution when the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the solution falls. The decrease in carbon dioxide partial pressure is caused by uptake by plants for photosynthesis or direct loss to the atmosphere. This reduces the availability of carbonic acid in solution, shifting the above equilibrium back towards the formation of calcium carbonate. The result is the precipitation of calcium carbonate and the formation of marl.

=== Nutrient cycling ===
Fen, being a distinct type of wetland, shares many biogeochemical characteristics with other wetlands. Like all wetlands, they play an important role in nutrient cycling because they are located at the interface of aerobic (oxic) and anaerobic (anoxic) environments. Most wetlands have a thin top layer of oxygenated soil in contact with the atmosphere or oxygenated surface waters. Nutrients and minerals may cycle between this oxidized top layer and the reduced layer below, undergoing oxidation and reduction reactions by the microbial communities adapted to each layer. Many important reactions take place in the reduced layer, including denitrification, manganese reduction, iron reduction, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis. Because wetlands are hotspots for nutrient transformations and often serve as nutrient sinks, they may be constructed to treat nutrient-rich waters created by human activities.

Fens are also hotspots for primary production, as the continuous input of groundwater stimulates production. Bogs, which lack this input of groundwater, have much lower primary production.

==== Carbon ====
Carbon from all types of wetlands, including fens, arrives mostly as organic carbon from either adjacent upland ecosystems or by photosynthesis in the wetland itself. Once in the wetland, organic carbon generally has three main fates: oxidation to CO2 by aerobic respiration, burial as organic matter in peat, or decomposition to methane. In peatlands, including fens, primary production by plants is greater than decomposition, which results in the accumulation of organic matter as peat. Resident mosses usually carry out decomposition within the fen, and temperate fens are often driven by plant roots&#x27; decomposition. These peat stores sequester an enormous amount of carbon. Nevertheless, it is difficult to determine whether fens net take up or emit greenhouse gases. This is because fens emit methane, which is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Methanogenic archaea that reside in the anaerobic layers of peat combine carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas to form methane and water. This methane can then escape into the atmosphere and exert its warming effects. Peatlands dominated by brown mosses and sedges such as fens have been found to emit a greater amount of methane than &quot;Sphagnum&quot;-dominated peatlands such as bogs.

==== Nitrogen ====
Fens play an important role in the global nitrogen cycle due to the anaerobic conditions found in their soils, which facilitate the oxidation or reduction of one form of nitrogen to another. Most nitrogen arrives in wetlands as nitrate from runoff, in organic matter from other areas, or by nitrogen fixation in the wetland. There are three main forms of nitrogen found in wetlands: nitrogen in organic matter, oxidized nitrogen (nitrate or nitrite), and ammonium.

Nitrogen is abundant in peat. When the organic matter in peat is decomposed in the absence of oxygen, ammonium is produced via ammonification. In the oxidized surface layer of the wetland, this ammonium is oxidized to nitrite and nitrate by nitrification. The production of ammonium in the reduced layer and its consumption in the top oxidized layer drives upward diffusion of ammonium. Likewise, nitrate production in the oxidized layer and nitrate consumption in the reduced layer by denitrification drives downward diffusion of nitrate. Denitrification in the reduced layer produces nitrogen gas and some nitrous oxide, which then exit the wetland to the atmosphere. Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas whose production is limited by nitrate and nitrite concentrations in fens.

Nitrogen, along with phosphorus, controls how fertile a wetland is.

==== Phosphorus ====
Almost all of the phosphorus that arrives in a wetland does so through sediments or plant litter from other ecosystems. Along with nitrogen, phosphorus limits wetland fertility. Under basic conditions like those found in extremely rich fens, calcium will bind to phosphate anions to make calcium phosphates, which are unavailable for uptake by plants. Mosses also play a considerable role in aiding plants in phosphorus uptake by decreasing soil phosphorus stress and stimulating phosphatase activity in organisms found below the moss cover. Helophytes have been shown to bolster phosphorus cycling within fens, especially in fen reestablishment, due to their ability to act as a phosphorus sink, which prevents residual phosphorus in the fen from being transferred away from the it. Under normal conditions, phosphorus is held within soil as dissolved inorganic phosphorus, or phosphate, which leaves trace amounts of phosphorus in the rest of the ecosystem.

Iron is important in phosphorus cycling within fens. Iron can bind to high levels of inorganic phosphate within the fen, leading to a toxic environment and inhibition of plant growth. In iron-rich fens, the area can become vulnerable to acidification, excess nitrogen and potassium, and low water levels. Peat soils play a role in preventing the bonding of irons to phosphate by providing high levels of organic anions for iron to bind to instead of inorganic anions such as phosphate.

=== Bog–rich-fen gradient ===
Bogs and fens can be thought of as two ecosystems on a gradient from poor to rich, with bogs at the poor end, extremely rich fens at the rich end, and poor fens in between. In this context, &quot;rich&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; refer to the species richness, or how biodiverse a fen or bog is. The richness of these species is strongly influenced by pH and concentrations of calcium and bicarbonate. These factors assist in identifying where along the gradient a particular fen falls. In general, rich fens are minerotrophic, or dependent on mineral-rich groundwater, while bogs are ombrotrophic, or dependent on precipitation for water and nutrients. Poor fens fall between these two.

==== Rich fens ====

Rich fens are strongly minerotrophic; that is, a large proportion of their water comes from mineral-rich ground or surface water. Fens that are more distant from surface waters such as rivers and lakes, however, are more rich than fens that are connected. This water is dominated by calcium and bicarbonate, resulting in a slightly acidic to slightly basic pH characteristic of rich fens. These conditions promote high biodiversity. Within rich fens, there is a large amount of variability. The richest fens are the extreme rich (marl) fens, where marl deposits are often build up. These are often pH 7 or greater. Rich and intermediate rich fens are generally neutral to slightly acidic, with a pH of approximately 7 to 5. Rich fens are not always very productive; at high calcium concentrations, calcium ions bind to phosphate anions, reducing the availability of phosphorus and decreasing primary production. Rich bogs with limited primary production can stabilize with the accumulation of mosses and mycorrhiza, which promote phosphorus cycling and can support the growth of new vegetation and bacteria. Brown mosses (family &quot;Amblystegiaceae&quot;) and sedges (genus &quot;Carex&quot;) are the dominant vegetation. However, an accumulation of mosses such as &quot;Sphagnum&quot; can lead to the acidification of the rich fen, potentially converting it into a poor fen. Compared to poor fens, rich fens have higher concentrations of bicarbonate, base cations (Na+, Ca2+, K+, Mg2+), and sulfate.

==== Poor fens ====
Poor fens are, in many ways, an intermediate between rich fens and bogs. Hydrologically, they are more similar to rich fens than to bogs, but regarding vegetation composition and chemistry, they are more similar to bogs than rich fens. They are much more acidic than their rich counterparts, with a pH of approximately 5.5 to 4. Peat in poor fens tends to be thicker than that of rich fens, which cuts off vegetation access to the mineral-rich soil underneath. In addition, the thicker peat reduces the influence of mineral-rich groundwater that buffers the pH. This makes the fen more ombrotrophic, or dependent on nutrient-poor precipitation for its water and nutrients. Poor fens may also form in areas where the groundwater supplying the fen flows through sediments that don&#x27;t dissolve well or have low buffering capacity when dissolved. Species richness tends to be lower than that of rich fens but higher than that of bogs. Poor fens, like bogs, are dominated by &quot;Sphagnum&quot; mosses, which acidify the fen and decrease nutrient availability.

== Threats ==
One of the many threats that fens face is conversion to agricultural lands. Where climates are suitable, fens have been drained for agricultural use alongside crop production, grazing, and hay making. Draining a fen directly is particularly damaging because it lowers the water table. A lower water table can increase aeration and dry out peat, allowing for aerobic decomposition or burning of the organic matter in peat. Draining a fen indirectly by decreasing its water supply can be just as damaging. Disrupting groundwater flow into the fen with nearby human activities such as quarrying or residential development changes how much water and nutrients enter the fen. This can make the fen more ombrotrophic (dependent on precipitation), which results in acidification and a change in water chemistry. This directly impacts the habitat of these species, and many signature fen species disappear.

Fens are also threatened by invasive species, fragmentation, peat cutting, and pollution. Non-native invasive species, such as the common buckthorn in North America, can invade fens and outcompete rare fen species, reducing biodiversity. Habitat fragmentation threatens fen species, especially rare or endangered species that are unable to move to nearby fens due to fragmentation. Peat cutting, while much more common in bogs, does happen in fens. Peat cut from fens has many uses, including burning as a fuel. Pollutants can alter the chemistry of fens and facilitate invasion by invasive species. Common pollutants of fens include road salts, nutrients from septic tanks, and runoff of agricultural fertilizers and pesticides.

==Use of term in literature==
Shakespeare used the term &quot;fen-sucked&quot; to describe the fog (literally: rising from marshes) in &quot;King Lear&quot;, when Lear says, &quot;Infect her beauty, You fen-sucked fogs drawn by the powerful sun, To fall and blister.&quot;

<doc id="113534" wikidata="Q663016" url="?curid=113534" title="Sex tourism">
<text>Sex tourism is the practice of traveling to foreign countries, often on a different continent, with the intention of engaging in sexual activity or relationships, in exchange providing money or lifestyle support. This practice predominantly operates in countries where sex work is legal. The World Tourism Organization of the United Nations has acknowledged that this industry is organized both within and outside the structured laws and networks created by them.

Sex tourism is commonly regarded as a transnational challenge, as it can be seen to target marginalised demographics in developing nations, such as countries in the Americas or Southeast Asia. The chief ethical concerns arise from: the economic gap between tourists and residents, the sexual trafficking of children and women and the parties taking advantage of the ability to engage with minors. These groups and individuals are subject to the foreign prostitution laws of the destination&#x27;s jurisdiction, often resulting in exploitation and abuse. Prostitution activities that involve minors are universally non-consensual and illegal.

Sex tourism is known as a multibillion-dollar industry that globally supports a workforce estimated in the millions, with service industries such as the airline, taxi, restaurant and hotel industries profiting. The bulk of sex tourism involves males traveling from countries in the Global North to countries in the Global South, such as in East and Southeast Asia and Latin America. Although much rarer, female sex tourism also exists.

==Legal issues==
This particular industry of sex work is a predominant reason for world travel and is extremely profitable. The market can become exceedingly exploitative and unethically abused as tourists are motivated to engage in sexual conduct due to the untraceable nature and lack of law enforcement control, especially with accessibility to minors.

Ethical issues arise due to the situations of participating parties; many sex workers are from low-income backgrounds usually located in underdeveloped societies whose only means for providing basic needs is to engage in sexual services. While sex workers can engage voluntarily in the industry, there is a distinct difference between the coercion found in international sex trafficking and sex tourism which exploits the limited work options for low socioeconomic local residents.

Government and law enforcement often do not place priority on policing prostitution and sex trafficking. For example, in Cambodia, the Cambodian government has previously overlooked tourists having sex with Cambodian adolescents.

Individuals are not exempt from prosecution. Sex tourism as recognised by the CDC supports human trafficking and slavery. Even if prostitution is legal in a country or region, human trafficking, sexual encounters with a minor, and child pornography are almost universally criminal in nature and individuals caught breaking these laws can be prosecuted. Citizens of any foreign country must abide by the laws of the country in which they hold citizenship in addition to the local laws of the country they are visiting, including laws regarding consent.

== Demographics ==
Demographics include: female sex tourism (women seeking men), men seeking men, adults seeking children, and men seeking women. Sex tourists generally come from Western world countries but they may also come from other countries as well. The most common destinations for these sex tourists is to visit less economically developed nations in Asia, such as: Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal, as well as countries in Central and South America like Mexico or Brazil.

A study conducted by the non-profit public charity ProCon, revealed the percentage of men who had paid for sex at least once in their lives between 1994 and 2010. It found the highest rates were located in Cambodia, where 59–80% of men had paid for sex at least once. Thailand was a close second with an estimated 75% of men, followed by Italy at 16.7–45%, Spain at 27–39%, Japan at 37%, the Netherlands at 13.5–21.6%, and the United States 15.0–20.0%.

Challenges in gathering data has made it hard to find out the exact number of people who work in the sex tourism industry. Estimates show 24.9 million victims that are trapped in modern-day slavery, 4.8 million (about 19%) were sexually exploited. It is estimated that about 21% of the total victims of commercial sexual exploitation are children, with the US Department of State estimating that over one million children are trafficked for sex throughout the world. The sex tourism industry often preys on those that are the most vulnerable, potentially explaining why children and women are more likely to be forced into the industry.

== Cultural attitudes ==
Globally, there are different cultural attitudes towards sex tourism. In less developed countries for example, families in poor rural areas may sell their children to human traffickers, who will take the children to major cities to work in the sex industry. In Thailand for example, women will support their husbands by becoming sex workers. To work in the sex industry, particularly in less developed countries, can often be seen as a viable source of income available to struggling families from low socioeconomic backgrounds.

The cultural attitudes of sex tourism in highly developed countries such as Australia however where sex trafficking is illegal and highly policed can offer a different perspective to those of lesser backgrounds. Brothels are still vivid within states such as New South Wales, Tasmania and Victoria where people can exchange money for sex. Recent studies suggest that sex slavery is still happening in Australia, exploiting the vulnerability of individuals and families from poor backgrounds.

Male tourists, sometimes known as &quot;sexpats (&quot;expatriate &quot;+&quot; sex tourist&quot;),&quot; join online communities in which they share advice on destinations and, although it is not among the most common cases, there is the category of &quot;girlfriend experience&quot; which, in some cases, evolves into an emotional relationship.

General attitudes towards sex work are complex and often regarded as controversial. Many countries where tourists come from, can have harsher attitudes towards sexual services.&lt;ref name=&quot;McPhee/McCartan&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Often the men who travel seeking to pay for sex may do so because it is much harder to engage in sex work in their home countries. Furthermore, in some countries, such as Cambodia and Thailand, this practice is considered commonplace, and men who do not engage in commercial sex may be considered unusual by their peers.

Sociologists from the University of Leicester conducted a research study for the Economic and Social Research Council and End Child Prostitution and Trafficking campaign, which interviewed over 250 Caribbean sex tourists. Amongst their findings were:
* Preconceptions about race and gender influenced the tourist&#x27;s opinions.
* Underdeveloped countries are considered culturally different, so in Western tourist&#x27;s understanding, the exploitation or male domination of women is without consequence or stigma of that found in their home countries.

Despite a great deal of interest in sexual tourism amongst theorists, detailed studies of cultural attitude are rare, regardless of the increasing accessibility of group studies in the past three decades.

== Economic and policy implications ==
Sex tourism has implications for all nations involved. Economically, sex tourism is encouraged by the tourist sectors of destination countries. It draws wealthy individuals with the allure of cheap, unstigmatised sexual activities, and stimulates the economy of poorer nations. This line of sex work ensures a consistent flow of income into developing countries&#x27; economies.

In an article published by the University of Chicago, it is argued that the promotion of sex tourism caters to tourists by enticing racial and ethnic stereotypes. This in turn creates ethical and policy implications, as colonial and traditional attitudes reinforce inequality between the groups. The state plays a vital part in this interaction, as governments create financially motivated barriers when asked to formulate more progressive and ethical policy.

Sex work may yield higher wages than work in the formal sector, and can encourage engagement with the industry for those seeking to achieve a much higher quality of life. This economic temptation can often lead to sexual exploitation of children. Young girls and adolescent women are some of the most common to be sold into slavery or transported across national borders to work in the commercial sex industry.

== Gay sex tourism ==
The sex tourism industry offers a market for gay, bisexual and bi-curious tourists. Studies suggest that gay sex tourism has similar motivations to non-gay sex tourism. These studies suggest, &quot;leisure activities and holidays have a particular significance for gay men, as they provide an opportunity for constructing, confirming and/or changing their sexual identity.&quot; 

Popular gay sex tourism markets can be found in Gran Canaria, Ibiza, Sardinia, Sicily and Fire Island. Similar to heterosexual sex tourism markets, some arrangements may be monetary and others may not. Different places have different ways of identifying their interest in such arrangements. For example, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, gay sex tourism has become a popular niche hosting a racially diverse market. The workers there are called &quot;Michês&quot; and stand out by wearing bright blue towels and often work in saunas.

== Adult-only resorts ==
Over recent years, adult-only sex resorts have become a popular alternative for travellers wanting to experience consensual sex abroad whilst avoiding the ethical issues of paid sexual activity. Those resorts can be characterised as safe, consensual spaces, and sexually positive nature, where all expressions of gender, orientation, and relationships are free of any pressure. These resorts largely occur in Mexico and the Caribbean. Certain establishments will be clothing-optional resorts, where travellers can meet and make use of &quot;playrooms&quot;.

== Child sex tourism ==
Some sex tourists travel in order to engage in sex with children. While it is criminal in most countries, this industry is believed to involve as many as 2 million children around the world. Thailand is considered to have the worst child sex trafficking record, followed closely by Brazil.

&quot;Child sex tourists may not have a specific preference for children as sexual partners but take advantage of a situation in which children are made available to them for sexual exploitation. It is often the case that these people have travelled from a wealthier country (or a richer town or region within a country) to a less-developed destination, where poorer economic conditions, favourable exchange rates for the traveller and relative anonymity are key factors conditioning their behaviour and sex tourism.&quot;

In an effort to eradicate the practice, many countries have enacted laws that allow the prosecution of their citizens for child abuse that occurs outside their home country, even if it is not against the law in the country where the incident took place. This is evident in America, under the United States Protect Act. In the United Kingdom, the Sexual Offences Act 2003 allows for prosecution in British criminal courts of British citizens who commit sexual offences against children while traveling abroad; this legislation was used to prosecute Richard Huckle in 2016. In Ireland, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 gives worldwide jurisdiction to prosecutors for sexual offences committed against children outside the state, and was used to prosecute Kieran Creaven for sexual acts with a child and producing child pornography in The Philippines in 2021. The Code of Conduct for the Sexual Exploitation of Children in Travel and Tourism is an international organisation composed of members of the tourism industry and children&#x27;s rights experts with the purpose to eradicate the practice of child sex tourism.

UNICEF notes that sexual activity is often seen as a private matter, making communities reluctant to act and intervene in cases of sexual exploitation. These attitudes make children far more vulnerable to sexual exploitation. Most exploitation of children takes place as a result of their absorption into the adult sex trade where they are exploited by local people and sex tourists. The Internet provides an efficient global networking tool for individuals to share information on destinations and procurement.

In cases involving children, the U.S. has relatively strict domestic laws that hold accountable any American citizen or permanent resident of the U.S. who travels abroad for the purpose of engaging in illicit conduct with a minor. As of 2009, sex tourism and human trafficking remain fast-growing industries.

== Regulation ==
Regulations and government involvement can be seen to have a positive impact on the community. It is argued that, by decriminalising prostitution, a government can protect sex workers under labor laws accessible by workers in other fields. For example, in the Netherlands, sex workers have access to unlimited free STI testing.

The criminalisation of sex-related jobs may be seen to increase workers&#x27; vulnerability to HIV by escalating stigma and discernment. It is suggested that judgement towards sex workers within the healthcare community acts as a barrier to accessing regular and informed care.

== Opposition ==

One of the primary sources of opposition to sex tourism is child sex tourism. This act is internationally defined as travel to have sex with a person under 18 years of age. An example of this would be when tourists from wealthy countries take advantage of legal prostitution, lower consent ages, and the lack of extradition laws in order to engage in sex with minors in foreign countries. Developed nations with more conservative views of sexuality can provide a steady stream of tourists who feed the sex tourism industry. Human rights organisations and governments argue that this pattern creates an incentive for trafficking of children and violation of children&#x27;s human rights.

Oppositions to sex tourism also stem from concerns around the trafficking of women. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime targets the trafficking of women and children as a central concern in their approach to transnational crime. The United Nations Global Report on Trafficking in Persons states that women &quot;comprise the vast majority&quot; of human trafficking victims for sexual exploitation across the world. They also note that women make up a relatively large portion of human trafficking offenders—about 30% of convicted human traffickers are women. It can be seen that women who become involved in human trafficking were once victims of sex trafficking and sexual exploitation themselves. 

These factors can all contribute to the debate on human rights and their relations with sex tourism. The sex tourism industry showcases a global view in sexual exploitation, and a lack of concern for the rights and dignity of sex workers. It can be argued that through the growing international porn industry, indicate a normalisation of prostitution and an increase in the exploitation of women.

The legality of prostitution and enforcement of such laws varies considerably around the world.

<doc id="113536" wikidata="Q831685" url="?curid=113536" title="Gawain">
<text>Gawain ( ), also known in many other forms and spellings, is a character in Arthurian legend, in which he is King Arthur&#x27;s nephew and one of the premier Knights of the Round Table. The prototype of Gawain is mentioned under the name Gwalchmei in the earliest Welsh sources. He has subsequently appeared in many Arthurian tales in Welsh, Latin, French, English, Scottish, Dutch, German, Spanish, and Italian, notably as the protagonist of the Middle English poem &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;. Other works featuring Gawain as their central character include &quot;De Ortu Waluuanii&quot;, &quot;Diu Crône&quot;, &quot;Ywain and Gawain&quot;, &quot;Golagros and Gawane&quot;, &quot;Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;âtre périlleux&quot;, &quot;La Mule sans frein&quot;, &quot;La Vengeance Raguidel&quot;, &quot;Le Chevalier à l&#x27;épée&quot;, &quot;Le Livre d&#x27;Artus&quot;, &quot;The Awntyrs off Arthure&quot;, &quot;The Greene Knight&quot;, and &quot;The Weddynge of Syr Gawen and Dame Ragnell&quot;.

In Arthurian chivalric romance literature, Gawain is usually depicted as King Arthur&#x27;s closest companion and an integral member of the elite Round Table. In the best-known versions of the legend, he is the son of Arthur&#x27;s sister Morgause and King Lot of Orkney and Lothian. Here, his younger brothers (or half-brothers) are Agravain, Gaheris, Gareth, and the infamous Mordred. However, his familial relations and upbringing are recorded differently in various accounts, although they often involve a story of Gawain unknowingly being raised in foster care in Rome before returning to Britain to reunite happily with his biological relatives. His many children from his numerous wives and lovers include the &quot;Fair Unknown&quot; Gingalain, himself a popular hero of Arthurian romance. 

In the early Welsh texts, Gawain is portrayed as a formidable but courteous and compassionate warrior, fiercely loyal to his king and his family. He is known as a friend to young knights, a defender of the poor and the unfortunate, and as the &quot;Maidens&#x27; Knight&quot;, a rescuer of women as well—in more than one variant of the Castle of Maidens theme. Other notable recurring motifs include his learned healing skills, his special swords that may include the famed Caliburn (Excalibur), and his mighty warhorse named Gringolet. In the later version of his legend, he possesses superhuman strength connected to a day and night cycle, adding to his already outstanding martial prowess and making him an invincible swordsman around noon, when the sun is at its height.

However, Gawain&#x27;s glowing portrayal diminishes in the Vulgate Cycle, which favours Lancelot and, especially, Galahad. His character turns markedly ignoble in the Post-Vulgate Cycle, and even outright villainous in the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;, resulting in his conflicting characterization in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. While he was originally known for his religious piety, here, he becomes a symbol of secular knighthood and thus a major object of criticism by the authors of French prose cycles. Two important plotlines shed light on Gawain&#x27;s redefined characterization: his being a leader in the family blood feud against the clan of King Pellinore and his initially close friendship with another great knight, Sir Lancelot, which becomes a bitter rivalry when he seeks vengeance for the death of his brothers. In this tradition, featured in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, Gawain&#x27;s sinful ways and his unforgiving nature inadvertently lead to the fall of Arthur and the Round Table, and ultimately his own death by Lancelot&#x27;s hand.

==Name==
Gawain is known by different names and variants in different languages. The character corresponds to the Welsh Gwalchmei ap Gwyar (meaning &quot;son of Gwyar&quot;), or Gwalchmai, and throughout the Middle Ages was known in Latin as Galvaginus, Gualgunus (&quot;Gualguanus&quot;, &quot;Gualguinus&quot;), Gualgwinus, Walwanus (&quot;Walwanius&quot;), Waluanus, Walwen, etc.; in Old French (and sometimes English) primarily as Gavain (&quot;Gavaine&quot;) and also as Gauvain (&quot;Gauvaine&quot;), Gauvan (&quot;Gauvayn&quot;), Gauven (&quot;Gauvein&quot;/&quot;Gauveyn&quot;), Gavan (&quot;Gavane&quot;) or
Gavayn (&quot;Gavayne&quot;); in Middle High German as Gâwein or Gâwân; in Italian dialects as Gavino, Galvagin or Galvano; in Old Spanish as Galván; in Old Portuguese as Galvam or Galvão; and in Middle English also as Gawaine, Gawan (&quot;Gawane&quot;), Gawayn (&quot;Gawayne&quot;), Gawein (&quot;Gaweine&quot;), 
Gaweyn (&quot;Gaweyne&quot;), Gauwein (&quot;Gauweine&quot;), Gauweyn (&quot;Gauweyne&quot;) or Wawen (&quot;Wowen&quot;), among many other forms and spellings. The later forms are generally assumed to derive from the Welsh &quot;Gwalchmei&quot;.

The element &quot;Gwalch&quot; means hawk, and is a typical epithet in medieval Welsh poetry. The meaning of &quot;mei&quot; is uncertain. It has been suggested that it refers to the month of May (&quot;Mai&quot; in Modern Welsh), rendering &quot;Hawk of May&quot;, although Rachel Bromwich considers this unlikely. Kenneth Jackson suggests the name evolved from an early Common Brittonic name *&quot;Ualcos Magesos&quot;, meaning &quot;Hawk of the Plain&quot;. Not all scholars accept the &quot;gwalch&quot; derivation. John Koch suggests the name could be derived from a Brythonic original &quot;*Wolcos Magesos&quot;, &quot;Wolf/Errant Warrior of the Plain.&quot; 

Others argue that the continental forms do not ultimately derive from &quot;Gwalchmei&quot;. Roger Sherman Loomis suggests a derivation from the epithet &quot;Gwallt Avwyn&quot;, found in the list of heroes in &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, which he translates as &quot;hair like reins&quot; or &quot;bright hair&quot;. Lauran Toorians proposes that the Dutch name Walewein (attested in Flanders and France c. 1100) was earliest, suggesting it entered Britain during the large settlement of Flemings in Wales in the early 12th century. However, most scholarship supports a derivation from Gwalchmei, variants of which are well attested in Wales and Brittany. Bromwich, Joseph Loth, and Heinrich Zimmer all trace the etymology of the continental versions to a corruption of the Breton form of this name, Walcmoei. 

==Gwalchmei==
Gawain&#x27;s precursor, Gwalchmei son of Gwyar, was a hero of Welsh mythology and clearly a major figure of the now largely lost oral tradition. His popularity greatly increased after foreign versions, particularly those derived from Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, became known in Wales. The &quot;Gwyar&quot; (meaning &quot;gore&quot; or &quot;spilled blood/bloodshed&quot;) in Gwalchmei ap Gwyar is likely the name of Gwalchmei&#x27;s mother, rather than his father, as is the standard in the Welsh Triads. Gwyar appears as a daughter of Amlawdd Wledig in one version of the hagiographical genealogy &quot;Bonedd y Saint&quot;. The 14th-century fragment &quot;Birth of Arthur&quot;, a Welsh text that adapts scenes from Geoffrey, substitutes Gwyar for Anna, Geoffrey&#x27;s name for Gawain&#x27;s mother, the Queen of Orkney. His father is named as &quot;Emyr Llydaw&quot; (Emperor of Brittany), that is Budic II of Brittany. There, Gwalchmei is given three sisters: Gracia, Graeria, and Dioneta, the last of which being a counterpart of Morgan.

Early references to Gwalchmei include the Welsh Triads; the &quot;Englynion y Beddau&quot; (&quot;Stanzas of the Graves&quot;), which lists the site of his grave; the &quot;Trioedd y Meirch&quot; (&quot;Triads of the Horses&quot;), which praises his horse named Keincaled (known as Gringolet in the works of medieval French authors); and Cynddelw&#x27;s elegy for Owain Gwynedd, which compares Owain&#x27;s boldness to that of Gwalchmei. In the Welsh Triads, Triad 4 lists him as one of the &quot;Three Well-Endowed Men of the Isle of Britain&quot; (probably referring to his inheritance); Triad 75 describes him as one of the &quot;Three Men of the Island of Britain who were Most Courteous to Guests and Strangers&quot;; and Triad 91 praises his fearlessness. Some versions of Triads 42 and 46 also praise his horse Keincaled, echoing the &quot;Triads of the Horses&quot;. The singling out of Gwalchmei as Most Courteous evokes his role in the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, where he regularly serves as an intermediary between King Arthur&#x27;s court and stranger knights.

An early Welsh romance &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, composed in the 11th century (though not recorded until the 14th), and eventually associated with the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, ascribes to Gwalchmei the same relationship with Arthur that Gawain is later given: he is the son of Arthur&#x27;s sister and one of his leading warriors. However, he is mentioned only twice in the text, once in the extensive list of Arthur&#x27;s court towards the beginning of the story, and again as one of the &quot;Six Helpers&quot; whom Arthur sends with the protagonist Culhwch on his journey to find his love Olwen. Unlike the other helpers, he takes no further part in the action. This suggests he was added to the romance later, likely under the influence of the Welsh versions of Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot;. He also appears in &quot;Peredur fab Efrawg&quot; (&quot;Peredur son of Efrawg&quot;), part of the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, where he aids the hero Peredur in the final battle against the nine witches of Caer Loyw. A similar motif was mentioned by the 16th-century Welsh scholar Sion Dafydd Rhys in an unrecorded oral tale in which Gwalchmei destroyed three evil witch-sisters, wives of the giants previously slain by Arthur, killing them within their castles through his cunning, as they could not be defeated otherwise, due to their powers. Gwalchmei himself appears as a giant in Welsh folklore.

==Gawain==

===Histories and romances===
The first known references to Gawain outside Wales began to appear in the first half of the 12th century. William of Malmesbury writes, in his &quot;Gesta Regum Anglorum&quot; of around 1125, that &quot;Walwen&#x27;s&quot; grave had been uncovered in Pembrokeshire hundreds of years after his death, following the 11th-century Norman conquest of England. William recounts how Arthur&#x27;s nephew, a renowned Post-Roman Briton soldier celebrated for his bravery, tirelessly fought against the Saxons led by Hengest&#x27;s brother: &quot;He deservedly shared in his uncle&#x27;s praising, because he prevented the fall of his collapsing country for many years.&quot; William also noted uncertainty regarding the manner of his death: &quot;There, as certain people claim, he [Walwen] was wounded by his enemies, and cast forth from a shipwreck; by others, it is said that he was killed by his fellow citizens at a public feast. Therefore, knowledge of the truth falls in doubt, although neither of these stories would fail in defense of his fame.&quot; He also describes Walwen as a former ruler of Galloway, which he says was still called Walweitha centuries later in his times.

However, it was Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s version of Gawain in the &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, written around 1136, that brought the character to a wider audience. As in the Welsh tradition, Geoffrey&#x27;s Gawain (Gualguanus) is the son of Arthur&#x27;s sister, here named Anna, and her husband is Lot (Loth), the prince of Lothian and one of Arthur&#x27;s key supporters. Geoffrey mentions that Gawain was twelve years old at the time when King Lot and Arthur began a war with Norway, and that he had previously served Pope Sulpicius in Rome. Gawain later plays a major role as one of the leaders in Arthur&#x27;s victorious war against the Romans, having personally started this great conflict by killing the Roman envoy Caius (Gaius Quintilianus) who had insulted him and Arthur. Geoffrey&#x27;s Gawain is depicted as a supreme warrior (even calling him and Hoel the two &quot;warriors than whom no better had ever been born&quot;) and potential heir to the throne until he is tragically struck down by the forces of his traitorous brother Mordred (Modredus) at Richborough, during an attempted sea landing that turned into a disaster.

Geoffrey&#x27;s work was immensely popular and was adapted into many languages. The Norman version by Wace, the &quot;Roman de Brut&quot;, ascribes to Gawain the chivalric aspect he would take in later literature, wherein he favours courtliness and love over martial valor. Several later works expand on Geoffrey&#x27;s mention of Gawain&#x27;s boyhood spent in Rome, the most important of which is the anonymous Medieval Latin &quot;De Ortu Waluuanii Nepotis Arturi&quot; (&quot;The Rise of Gawain, Nephew of Arthur&quot;), which describes his birth, boyhood, and early adventures leading up to his knighting by his uncle.

Beginning with the five works of Chrétien de Troyes in the second half of the 12th century, Gawain became a very popular figure in Old French chivalric romances. Chrétien features Gawain as a major character and establishes some characteristics that pervade later depictions, including his unparalleled courteousness and his way with women. His romances set the pattern often followed in later works in which Gawain serves as an ally to the protagonist and a model of knighthood to whom others are compared. However, in Chrétien&#x27;s later romances, especially &quot;Lancelot, le Chevalier de la Charrette&quot; (&quot;Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart&quot;) and &quot;Perceval ou le Conte du Graal&quot; (&quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;), the eponymous heroes Lancelot and Percival prove morally superior to Gawain, who follows the rules of courtliness to the letter rather than the spirit. Chrétien&#x27;s story of Gawain&#x27;s cousin Yvain, &quot;Yvain ou le Chevalier au Lion&quot; (&quot;Yvain, the Knight of the Lion&quot;), was translated into Middle English as &quot;Ywain and Gawain&quot;. Gawain is also prominent in the continuations of &quot;Perceval&quot;, in particular the First Continuation and &quot;Perlesvaus&quot;.

An influx of romances written in French appeared in Chrétien&#x27;s wake. While Gawain stands out as the most popular character of all Arthurian knights in the entire genre, their authors characterise him variously. In some of these &quot;Gawain romances&quot;, such as &quot;La Vengeance Raguidel&quot; (or &quot;Messire Gauvain&quot;) and &quot;La Mule sans frein&quot; (perhaps also written by Chrétien himself), he is the hero. In others, such as &quot;Meraugis de Portlesguez&quot; and &#x27;, he aids the hero. Sometimes he is also the subject of burlesque humor, as in the parody &quot;Le Chevalier à l&#x27;épée&quot; (&quot;The Knight with the Sword&quot;). In the variants of the &quot;Bel Inconnu&quot; (Fair Unknown) story, he is the father of the hero. &#x27;, also known as &quot;Le Chevalier aux deux épées&quot; (&quot;The Knight of Two Swords&quot;), contrasts the adventures of Gawain with these of the eponymous Mériadeuc, his former squire. Another notable squire of Gawain is the also eponymous protagonist of &quot;&quot;.

For the English and the Scottish, Gawain remained a respectable and heroic figure, becoming the subject of several romances (a dozen in English, besides the likes of the Anglo-Norman &quot;Romanz du reis Yder&quot;) and lyrics in the dialects of their nations, such as the Middle Scots poem &quot;Golagros and Gawane&quot;. Important Gawain romances in English include &quot;The Awntyrs off Arthure&quot; (&quot;The Adventures of Arthur&quot;), &quot;Syre Gawene and the Carle of Carlyle&quot; (&quot;Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle&quot;), and &quot;The Avowyng of Arthur&quot; (&quot;The Avowing of Arthur&quot;). The Middle Dutch romances by Penninc and Pieter Vostaert, the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Story of Gawain&quot;), held at Leiden University Libraries, and &quot;Walewein ende Keye&quot; (&quot;Gawain and Kay&quot;), are both dedicated primarily to Gawain. The Middle High German romance &quot;Diu Crône&quot; (&quot;The Crown&quot;) by Heinrich von dem Türlin, in which Gawain is the protagonist who achieves the Grail and heals the Fisher King, also features a minor character of &quot;the other Gawain&quot;: his lookalike, Aamanz. 

Gawain is notably the hero of one of the greatest works of Middle English literature, the alliterative poem &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, where he is portrayed as an excellent, but human, knight. Here, Gawain strongly resembles the Irish mythological hero Cuchulainn. In the poem, he must go to the titular Green Knight to, presumably, be killed by the Knight. Gawain does this as it pertains to a deal made between the two without knowing that it is all a test by the Knight. He is cited in Robert Laneham&#x27;s letter describing the entertainments at Kenilworth in 1575, and the recopying of earlier works such as &quot;The Greene Knight&quot; suggests that a popular English tradition of Gawain continued. Different variants of the Green Knight story include &quot;The Turke and Sir Gawain&quot;. In possibly Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;The Weddynge of Syr Gawen and Dame Ragnell&quot; (&quot;The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle&quot;), his wits, virtue, and respect for women frees his wife, a loathly lady, from her curse of ugliness. The Child Ballads include a preserved legend in a positive light: &quot;The Marriage of Sir Gawain&quot;, a fragmentary version of the story of &quot;The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle&quot;.

The &quot;Lancelot-Grail&quot; (Vulgate Cycle) depicts Gawain as a proud and worldly knight and the leader of his siblings, who demonstrates through his failures the danger of neglecting the spiritual in favor of the material world. On the grand Grail Quest, his intentions are always the purest, but he is unable to use God&#x27;s grace to see the error of his ways. Later, when his brothers Mordred and Agravain plot to destroy Lancelot and Queen Guinevere by exposing their love affair, Gawain tries to stop them. When Guinevere is sentenced to burn at the stake and Arthur deploys his best knights to guard the execution, Gawain nobly refuses to take part in the deed, even though his brothers will be there. But when Lancelot returns to rescue Guinevere, a battle between Lancelot&#x27;s and Arthur&#x27;s knights ensues, and Gawain&#x27;s brothers Gareth and Gaheris are killed (Agravain, too, is killed by Lancelot, either on this occasion or in a previous encounter). This turns his friendship with Lancelot into hatred, and his desire for vengeance causes him to draw Arthur into a war with Lancelot in France. In the king&#x27;s absence, Mordred usurps the throne, and the Britons must return to save Britain. Meanwhile, Gawain is mortally wounded by Lancelot himself after a long duel. King Arthur, his uncle in this version of the tale, becomes very distraught as he mourns his death. The Vulgate &quot;Mort Artu&quot; has Gawain&#x27;s dead body carried to Camelot, where he is placed in the tomb of his dear brother Gaheriet (Gaheris).

Gawain&#x27;s death in a battle against Mordred is described in detail in the English Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot;. Upon reaching land after returning to Britain from the continent, Gawain wreaks great slaughter on his enemies, killing the king of Gothland among others, before being surrounded on a hill. Breaking out, he pushes forward on a horse towards Mordred himself, and the two strike one another down from their horses with their lances. Gawain then attempts to cut Mordred&#x27;s throat, but Mordred stabs him through the helmet. (As Mordred is portrayed there more sympathetically than in most other works, he later gives a sorrowful eulogy to his dead brother, calling him the best and most glorious of knights.) In the French verse &quot;Mort Artu&quot; attachment to &quot;&quot;, Gawain attempts to disembark during the sea landing at Dover when one of Mordred&#x27;s Saxon allies fatally strikes him in the head through an unlaced helmet; a similar account is told in the English Stanzaic &quot;Morte Arthur&quot;. In the Italian romance &quot;La Tavola Ritonda&quot;, having been defeated in his duel with Lancelot, Gawain takes part in resisting an attack by Lancelot&#x27;s friend and ally, Sir Turinoro of Cartagina, when he is struck on his head in the same place where Lancelot had wounded him and falls dead during a single combat with a knight named Turinoro, who also dies.

Thomas Malory&#x27;s English compilation work &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; is based mainly, but not exclusively, on French works from the Vulgate and Post-Vulgate Cycles. Here Gawain partly retains the negative characteristics attributed to him by the later French authors, and partly retains his earlier positive representations, creating a character seen by some as inconsistent, and by others as a believably flawed hero. Gawain is the first to declare that he &quot;shall laboure in the Queste of the Sankgreall&quot; but really embarks on the Grail quest in order to gain more magical meals and drinks (&quot;metys and drynkes&quot;) from it rather than from a religious zeal or to save the Fisher King&#x27;s kingdom. One of Malory&#x27;s other French sources was &quot;L&#x27;âtre périlleux&quot; (&quot;The Perilous Cemetery&quot;), a poem about Gawain&#x27;s rescue of a woman from a demon.

Malory&#x27;s version of Gawain&#x27;s demise follows the Vulgate. Gawain&#x27;s two sons and his brothers, except for Mordred, end up slain by Lancelot and his followers. Their death unleashes the vindictive hostility of Gawain towards his former friend, drawing Arthur himself into a war with Lancelot, first in Britain and then in France. Gawain&#x27;s rage is so great that he refuses to cease fighting even after the Pope steps in and issues a bull to end the violence between Arthur&#x27;s and Lancelot&#x27;s factions. Following Mordred&#x27;s betrayal, Gawain wages two wars against both Mordred and Lancelot. He twice challenges Lancelot to a duel, but each time loses and asks Lancelot to kill him. Lancelot refuses and grants him mercy before leaving. The mortally injured Gawain later writes to Lancelot, repenting of his bitterness, asking for his help against Mordred, and for forgiveness for splitting the Round Table. Following his death, Gawain also appears in Arthur&#x27;s dream vision to tell him to wait thirty days for the reconciled Lancelot to return to Britain before fighting Mordred. Consequently, Arthur sends Lucan and Bedivere to make a temporary peace treaty, but the bloody final conflict ensues anyway. Upon his eventual arrival, Lancelot weeps at Gawain&#x27;s tomb for two nights. In his editorial preface to Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, William Caxton wrote that those visiting Dover Castle can still &quot;see the skull of [Sir Gawaine], and the same wound is seen that Sir Launcelot gave him in battle.&quot;

Finally, there are versions in which Gawain does not die. In Jean des Preis&#x27;s Belgian &quot;Ly Myreur des Histors&quot;, Arthur, defeated and wounded in his last battle with Mordrech (Mordred), goes with Gawain in a boat to the magic isle of Avalon for them to be healed there by the king&#x27;s sister Morgaine (Morgan). The surviving Gawain also features in the earlier French epic poem &quot;&quot;, appearing together with Arthur and Morgan in Avalon, where they are all still alive hundreds of years later.

=== Origin narratives and alternate siblings ===
&quot;Les Enfances Gauvain&quot;, based in part on &quot;De Ortu Waluuanii&quot;, tells of how Arthur&#x27;s sister Morcades (Morgause) becomes pregnant by Lot, at this point a mere page in King Arthur&#x27;s court. She and Lot secretly give the child to a knight named Gawain the Brown (&quot;Gauvain li Brun&quot;) who baptises the infant with his own name, puts the infant Gawain in a cask with a letter explaining who the child is, and sets him adrift on the sea. The cask is found by a fisherman and his wife. Sometime after Gawain is ten years of age, his foster-father vows to make a pilgrimage to Rome if he recovers from his severe illness. When he undertakes the pilgrimage, he takes his foster-child with him to Rome. There a clerk reads the knight&#x27;s letter, understands that the boy is of high birth, and the Pope takes Gawain as his own foster-son. Accounts similar to this can be found in &quot;Perlesvaus&quot;, the &quot;Gesta Romanorum&quot;, and many other texts.

In &quot;De Ortu Waluuani&quot;, the young Gawain, trained as a Roman cavalry officer, undertakes a duel to determine whether Rome or Persia should possess Jerusalem. On his way, Gawain and his men defeat the pirate king Milocrates and his brother Buzafarnam, rescuing the Roman Emperor&#x27;s niece whom Milocrates has abducted. In Jerusalem, he fights the giant Persian champion Gormund and slays him after three days of single combat. He is then sent to King Arthur with the proof of his birth. Arthur&#x27;s queen, here named Gwendoloena and possessing prophetic powers, warns Arthur of the coming of a knight of Rome who is more powerful than him; Arthur and Kay meet Gawain on his way but he unhorses them both. Gawain then arrives at Arthur&#x27;s court, but the king rejects him despite learning of the knight being his nephew. In response, Gawain vows that he will do what Arthur&#x27;s entire army could not do. The occasion comes when the Lady of the Castle of Maidens sends to Arthur for aid, having been abducted by a pagan king who wants to force marriage on her. Arthur and his forces go to fight the pagan army but lose, yet Gawain single-handedly succeeds and returns with the Lady and with the pagan king&#x27;s head. Arthur is finally forced to publicly accept the knight&#x27;s worth, and Lot and Anna formally acknowledge Gawain as their son.

Similar to this tale are the stories of the Castle of Wonders, found in &quot;Diu Crône&quot;, Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Perceval&quot;, Wolfram von Eschenbach&#x27;s &quot;Parzival&quot;, and the Norse &quot;Valvens þáttr&quot; (&quot;The Tale of Gawain&quot;), wherein Gawain comes to the castle where, unknown to him, live his grandmother (King Arthur&#x27;s mother), his own mother, and his sister. Gawain becomes the castle&#x27;s lord, and it would be likely that he would unknowingly marry either his mother or his sister, but Gawain discovers who the women are. In a variant included in the &quot;Gesta Romanorum&quot;, a Gawain-like character named Gregory comes to a castle where his mother dwells, besieged by the Duke of Burgundy. Gregory enters the lady&#x27;s service and succeeds in winning back her lands, after which he unwittingly marries his own mother.

Later romances, however, abandon the motif of Gawain being brought up, unknown, in Rome. In the &quot;Suite du Merlin&quot; attributed to Robert de Boron, a marriage between King Lot and a daughter of Ygerne (Igraine, Arthur&#x27;s mother) is part of the negotiations arranging for Arthur&#x27;s father Uther Pendragon&#x27;s marriage to Ygerne; Gawain must be thus about the same age as Arthur, or even older. In the Vulgate &quot;Merlin&quot;, he first appears as a young squire in his father&#x27;s kingdom. Gawain, his brother Gaheris, and a number of other squires, most of them sons or kindred of the kings who at this time are rebelling against King Arthur, come together and defend the land of Logres against the Saxons while Arthur is away aiding King Leodegan (Leodegrance) against King Rion (Rience), after which Arthur knights the squires. During this time, Gawain notably saves their mother Belisent (Morgause) and the infant Mordred from being kidnapped by the Saxon king Taurus. This account is revised in the later Post-Vulgate &quot;Merlin&quot;, where King Lot fights against Arthur but his forces are defeated and he himself is killed by King Pellinor (Pellinore), one of King Arthur&#x27;s allies. Gawain first appears as an eleven-year-old boy at Lot&#x27;s funeral and swears to avenge his father&#x27;s death on Pellinor, praying that he may never be known for knightly deeds until he has taken vengeance. The story of the feud between Gawain and Pellinor and his sons is very important in the Post-Vulgate Cycle and the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;, but not a trace of it is found in the Lancelot-Grail Cycle or in any earlier known tale, some of which picture Lot as still alive long after Gawain becomes a knight.

In many works outside the &quot;Lancelot-Grail&quot;-derived tradition in which Gawain has only his now-familiar four brothers (among whom he is the eldest and is explicitly described as the most handsome of them by the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot;), Gawain also has sisters in different settings. These include an unnamed sister whom he rescues (along with her unnamed husband and children) from a giant in Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Yvain&quot;; two sisters named Soredamors (Cligés&#x27; mother) and Clarissant in Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Cligés&quot;; an unnamed sister abducted by Gorvain Cadru in &quot;Hunbaut&quot;; and Elainne in the Modena manuscript of the Didot &quot;Perceval&quot;. In &quot;Parzival&quot;, he has two sisters named Cundriê and Itonjê and a sole younger brother named Beacurs (the King of Norway and a Knight of the Round Table who marries King Bagdemagus&#x27;s niece Antonie). In some Welsh adaptations of &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; and in &quot;The Birth of Arthur&quot;, King Hoel is his half-brother from their mother&#x27;s first marriage. Mordred is Gawain&#x27;s younger brother (by Lot, originally) or half-brother (by Arthur, later) in almost every text in which he figures since Geoffrey of Monmouth.

===Attributes and characterizations===
Traditionally, Gawain, of all Arthur&#x27;s knights, is known for his courteousness, compassion, and humility. In &quot;Gawain: His Reputation, His Courtesy and His Appearance in Chaucer&#x27;s Squire&#x27;s Tale&quot;, B. J. Whiting collected quantitative evidence of these qualities being stronger in Gawain than in any of the other Knights of the Round Table, counting the words &quot;courteous&quot;, &quot;courtesy&quot;, and &quot;courteously&quot; being used in reference to Arthur&#x27;s nephew as 178 times in total, more than for all the other knights in Arthurian literature. The Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot; describes Gawain as the most handsome of his brothers and notably gracious towards poor people and to societal outcasts such as lepers; the one time when he fails to properly greet an unknown maiden (Viviane) while on a quest to learn the fate of Merlin in the Vulgate &quot;Merlin Continuation&quot;, she curses him with a spell that turns him into a hideous dwarf, but later restores him to his real form after he passes a test to save her from an apparent rape in an arranged &quot;damsel in distress&quot;-style scenario. In some versions of the legend, Gawain would have been the true and rightful heir to the throne of Camelot, after the reign of King Arthur.

The Vulgate &quot;Mort Artu&quot; says Gawain had been baptised as an infant by a miracle-working holy man, also named Gawain. The other Gawain named the boy after himself, and who announced the following day that every day at noon, at the hour of the baptism, his power and strength would increase. His recurring status of a solar hero, as well as some of his other traits and adventures, especially within the variants of the Green Knight tale, suggest that Gawain may have been originally a Welsh counterpart of the Irish mythology hero Cú Chulainn, and also led to scholarly hypothesis according to which Gawain&#x27;s figure could be derived from a Celtic sun god or perhaps a son of such deity. The Post-Vulgate narration tells how, in great part due to his supernatural strength, there have been only six knights whom Gawain failed to defeat in a sword fight: Lancelot, Hector, Bors, his own brother Gaheris (replaced with Percival by Malory), Tristan, and Morholt. In &quot;Perceval&quot; and some other later stories, he is the other wielder of Arthur&#x27;s magic sword Excalibur; in the Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot;, he has a sword named Galuth, which bears the name Galatine in Malory&#x27;s version of the Roman War episode. His knowledge of herbs also makes him a great healer, as shown in Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Perceval&quot;, &quot;Valvens Þáttr&quot;, &quot;Parzival&quot;, &quot;Walewein&quot;, and the Dutch Lancelot Compilation (in the stories &quot;Moriaen&quot;, &quot;Die Riddere metter Morwen&quot;, &quot;Walewein ende Keye&quot;, and &quot;Lancelot en het Hert met de Witte Voet&quot;).

In many romances, Gawain is depicted as a model for chivalric attributes. In &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, for example, where he is described as &quot;this fine father of breeding&quot;, Gawain receives the kisses of Lady Bertilak with discretion, at once not wanting to insult her by refusing her advances and not wanting to betray the hospitality of her husband. Based on the bargain to give each other their respective daily gains, Gawain must give the kisses he receives from Lady Bertilak to Sir Bertilak. This allusion serves to reinforce chivalric ideals of religious, martial, and courtly love codes, especially in a masculine warrior culture, and shows the ways in which the masculine world can be subverted by female wiles. This undertone of homoeroticism between Gawain and Sir Bertilak underscores the strength of male homosocial bonds, and the fact that sex never occurs reinforces ideals of the masculine chivalric code. Gawain&#x27;s character in the poem is said to be founded on a deep Christian belief in Christ and the Virgin Mary.

Conversely, in the Vulgate &quot;Queste del Saint Graal&quot; he is used as a very symbol of the unfitness of secular knighthood. Here, Gawain is blamed for his irreligion and is shown to indulge in rather purposeless killing: as, for example, when he mortally wounds his relative and a fellow Knight of the Round Table, Yvain the Bastard, in one of the many random jousting duels for no particular reason (failing to even recognise him until it is too late). He is also responsible for the deaths of more of his fellow Round Table companions, including the young King Bagdemagus of Gorre, whom he accidentally kills during a tournament. The Vulgate &quot;Mort Artu&quot; even says Gawain had killed some of his fellow Knights of the Round Table in the grand quest for the Grail, which he turned out to be unworthy to achieve. When Gawain does reach the Grail Castle, he is unable to restore the Grail Sword, unlike his role in &quot;Perceval&quot;, and is actually more interested in the Grail Maiden than in the holy relic, failing to even spot it there. In a symbolic later scene, it is her son and the new destined Grail hero, the blessed virgin knight Galahad, who will draw the sword in the stone at Camelot, after Gawain failed in the task. In the end, Gawain&#x27;s unwillingness to forgive Lancelot leads to his own death and contributes to the downfall of Arthur&#x27;s kingdom.

In the Post-Vulgate Cycle, Gawain&#x27;s character is further blackened, influenced by being portrayed as a villain in the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;. He is now bloodthirsty and often murderous. Among important Knights of the Round Table whom Gawain is said to have killed during and after the Grail quest are King Pellinor&#x27;s son Aglovale, King Lac&#x27;s son Erec, and King Esclabor&#x27;s son Palamedes (resulting in Escablor&#x27;s own death from grief). Earlier, Gawain and his brothers are also the slayers of King Pellinor and his sons Driant and Lamorat. Although Gawain still has a reputation for being one of the best and most courteous knights in the world, this is a sham, as he is often secretly a rapist of damsels and a killer of good knights, no better than his brother Agravain. When the mighty and holy Grail knight Perceval asks Gawain if he had killed his father Pellinor, Gawain simply lies and denies it out of fear of Perceval. The &quot;Guiron le Courtois&quot; section of &quot;Palamedes&quot; explains Gawain&#x27;s many great cruelties being caused by his grief at being surpassed by other knights after not regaining his full strength following the war with Galehaut. Such a new popular image originating in the late Old French romance tradition prompted the historical audience of &quot;The Wife of Bath&#x27;s Tale&quot; to identify the story&#x27;s rapist-knight character as Gawain. B. J. Whiting writes in &quot;Gawain: A Casebook&quot;:

Malory&#x27;s Gawain, following the later French prose depictions, also &quot;emerges as a character composed of obvious inconsistencies of virtue and evil.&quot; Nevertheless, according to Arthurian scholar Ryan Harper, considering Gawain&#x27;s many varied (and for most part positive) medieval portrayals,

===Children and relationships===
Hartmann von Aue&#x27;s &quot;Erec&quot; is the first to mention Gawain&#x27;s offspring, listing one &quot;Henec the Skillful, son of Gawain&quot; (&quot;Henec suctellois fil Gawin&quot;), among the Knights of the Round Table. Thomas Malory credits Gawain with three sons through the Lady of Lys, a sister of Bran de Lys/Lis (or &quot;Brandles&quot; in the Middle English &quot;The Jeaste of Syr Gawayne&quot;); they are named Florence, Lovell, and Gingalain. Both Lovell (Lioniel) and Gingalain (Guinglain) have previously appeared in the First Continuation to Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Perceval&quot; and in the &quot;Livre d&#x27;Artus&quot;. Gingalain is the only of them to play a significant role in further works, as the eponymous protagonist of Renaud de Beaujeu&#x27;s Old French romance &quot;Le Bel Inconnu&quot; (&quot;The Fair Unknown&quot;), as well as of the Middle-English romance &quot;Libeaus Desconus&quot; and of its Middle High German version &quot;Wigalois&quot; (titled after Gingalain&#x27;s name) by Wirnt von Grafenberg. Besides those children, the eponymous hero of &quot;Beaudous&quot; by Robert de Blois is the son of Gawain by the king of Wales&#x27;s unnamed daughter, who is known only as the Lover (&quot;Amie&quot;). She might be the same as the also unnamed daughter of King Tradelmant of North Wales, a hitherto virgin who becomes pregnant by Gawain out of wedlock in the Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot;.

Since Gawain is known in multiple tales as the &quot;Knight of Maidens&quot; (French: &quot;Chevalier as Damoisels&quot;), his name is thus attached to no woman in particular. As such, he is the champion of all women, and through this reputation, he has avoided the name-pairing seen in tales of Erec (with Enide), Tristan (with Iseult), and Lancelot (with Guinevere). Nevertheless, Gawain has had wives in the course of Arthurian literature, albeit he is always introduced as yet unmarried at the beginning of any such story. In &quot;The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle&quot;, he marries the cursed Ragnelle, and in giving her &quot;sovereignty&quot; in the relationship, lifts the spell laid upon her that had given her a hag-like appearance. In &quot;Parzival&quot;, Gawain marries Orguelleuse, the widow of the Duke of Logres. (In &quot;Perlesvaus&quot;, the mad Orguelleuse instead unsuccessfully plots to kill Gawain and then to entomb herself with him; she is called the Maiden of the Narrow Wood in &quot;Hunbaut&quot;.) In &quot;Mériadeuc&quot;, the Queen of the Isles swears she will marry only Gawain. In &quot;Diu Crône&quot;, Gawain marries Amurfina, a niece of Arthur&#x27;s stepfather (here named Gansguoter) who wins Gawain from her own younger sister Sgoidamur through the use of a magic bridle and a love potion.

Gawain also often appears as intimately associated with a supernatural female figure from the Otherworld or the Fairyland. The hero of &quot;Le Bel Inconnu&quot; is the progeny of Gawain and a fairy called Blanc(h)emal, and Gawain is himself rescued by the fay Lorie in &quot;&quot; (&quot;Les Merveilles de Rigomer&quot;). The mother of Gawain&#x27;s son in &quot;Wigalois&quot; is known as Florie, likely another version of Lorie from &quot;Rigomer&quot;; she also appears as Floree, daughter of King Alain of Escavalon, in the &quot;Livre d&#x27;Artus&quot;. The Italian romance &quot;La Pulzella Gaia&quot; has Gawain fight and defeat a giant serpent that turns out to be just a form of fairy princess, the daughter of Morgan le Fay (Fata Morgana) who then becomes his secret lover; their relationship, once revealed, makes both of them into enemies of Guinevere (who is jealous of Gawain after having been spurned), Arthur, and Morgan all at once.

Other women of Gawain include Lady Bloisine who plots to murder Gawain in bed before genuinely falling in love with him in the Fourth Continuation of &quot;Perceval&quot;, Ydain (Ydeine) who pledges to love him for life after he rescues her in &quot;La Vengeance Raguidel&quot; and the &quot;Roman van Lancelot&quot;, and the haughty and cruel Arcade who loves Gawain but he gives her up to the young Pelleas after helping him win her over in the Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot;. Arcade is renamed as Lady Ettarde in Malory&#x27;s version with no happy end for her; his &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; also mentions Gawain having once been in the power of the lustful witch Hellawes. In the Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot;, Gawain also expressed his desire to himself become the most beautiful lady so he could be loved by the mysterious Black Knight (Lancelot appearing incognito).

==Modern portrayals==
Gawain features frequently in modern literature and media. Modern depictions of him are often heavily influenced by Malory, though characterizations are inconsistent. Alfred Tennyson adapted episodes from Malory to present Gawain as a worldly and faithless knight in his &quot;Idylls of the King&quot; (1859–1885). Similarly, T. H. White&#x27;s novel &quot;The Once and Future King&quot; (1958) follows Malory, but presents Gawain as more churlish than Malory&#x27;s torn and tragic portrayal. In contrast, Thomas Berger&#x27;s &quot;Arthur Rex&quot; (1978) portrays Gawain as open-minded and introspective about his flaws, qualities that make him the Round Table&#x27;s greatest knight. Though he usually plays a supporting role, some works feature Gawain as the main character. Vera Chapman&#x27;s &quot;The Green Knight&quot; (1975) and Anne Crompton&#x27;s &quot;Gawain and Lady Green&quot; (1997) offer modern retellings of &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;. Gwalchmei is the protagonist in Gillian Bradshaw&#x27;s Celtic-tinged &quot;Hawk of May&quot; (1980) and its sequels. Gawain is a major character in &quot;The Squire&#x27;s Tales&quot; series by Gerald Morris, in which he is portrayed as a skilled knight, immensely loyal to Arthur, and an intelligent, kind-hearted, and occasionally sarcastic. Morris included many legends involving Gawain in the second book, &quot;The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady&quot; (1999), drawing in particular from &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;. An aged Gawain is one of the central characters in Kazuo Ishiguro&#x27;s novel &quot;The Buried Giant&quot; (2015). In the manga &quot;Four Knights of the Apocalypse&quot; (2022), a sequel to &quot;Seven Deadly Sins&quot;, Gawain is a member of the eponymous Knights, portrayed as female, a hugely muscular and prideful niece of Arthur. Since Gawain is female this time, her womanizer traits and rivalry with Tristan because of Isolde and knightly ambitions began to have a distinct queer shade. He is also depicted in multiple episodes of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Merlin&quot; (2008–2012), where he is a Knight of the Round Table under King Arthur. In this adaptation he is loyal to King Arthur and portrayed as a cocky, funny, and skilled knight. 

Film portrayals of Gawain, and the Arthurian legend in general, are often heavily indebted to Malory; White&#x27;s &quot;The Once and Future King&quot; also exerts a heavy influence. Gawain appears as a supporting character in films such as &quot;Knights of the Round Table&quot; (1953, played by Robert Urquhart) and &quot;Excalibur&quot; (1981, played by Liam Neeson), all of which draw on elements of Gawain&#x27;s traditional characterizations. Other films give Gawain a larger role. In the 1954 adaptation of &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;, he is a somewhat boorish, though noble and good-natured, foil for his squire and friend, Valiant. He plays his traditional part in the 1963 film &quot;Sword of Lancelot&quot; (played by George Baker), seeking revenge when Lancelot kills his unarmed brother Gareth, but ultimately coming to Lancelot&#x27;s aid when he uncovers Mordred&#x27;s responsibility. &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; has been adapted to film several times, including 1973&#x27;s &quot;Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; (played by Murray Head) and 1984&#x27;s &quot;Sword of the Valiant&quot; (played by Miles O&#x27;Keeffe), both directed by Stephen Weeks; neither film was well reviewed and both deviate substantially from the source material. A 1991 television adaptation by Thames Television, &quot;Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, was both more faithful and better received. Gawain&#x27;s more recent film and television portrayals include the roles of Robert Gwyn Davin in &quot;First Knight&quot; (1995), Anthony Hickox in &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; (1997), Sebastian Roché in &quot;Merlin&quot; (1998), Noah Huntley in &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; (2001), Joel Edgerton in &quot;King Arthur&quot; (2004), Eoin Macken in &quot;Merlin&quot; (2008), Clive Standen in &quot;Camelot&quot; (2011), Matt Stokoe in &quot;Cursed&quot; (2020), and Takahiro Mizushima in &quot;Fate/Extra Last Encore&quot; (2020). Another &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; film adaptation starred Dev Patel as Gawain in &quot;The Green Knight&quot; (2021).

The character has appeared in a number of stage productions and operas, mostly interpretations of &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;. Particularly notable among them is the 1991 opera &quot;Gawain&quot;, with music by Harrison Birtwistle and a libretto by David Harsent. Gawain furthermore appeared in a number of video games, including as the protagonist of &quot;Chronicles of the Sword&quot; (1997).

<doc id="113537" wikidata="Q535233" url="?curid=113537" title="Wimborne Minster">
<text>Wimborne Minster (often referred to as Wimborne, ) is a market town in Dorset in South West England, and the name of the Church of England church in that town. It lies at the confluence of the River Stour and the River Allen, north of Poole, on the Dorset Heaths, and is part of the South East Dorset conurbation. According to Office for National Statistics data the population of the Wimborne Minster built-up area was 15,552.

==Governance==
The town and its administrative area are served by eleven councillors plus one from the nearby ward of Cranfield. The electoral ward of Wimborne Minster is slightly bigger than the parish, with a 2011 population of 7,014. Wimborne Minster is part of the Mid Dorset and North Poole parliamentary constituency.

After 2019 structural changes to local government in England, Wimborne Minster is covered by Wimborne Minster and Colehill and Wimborne Minster East for elections to the Dorset Council unitary authority.

==Buildings and architecture==

Wimborne has one of the foremost collections of 15th-, 16th- and 17th-century buildings in Dorset. Local planning has restricted the construction of new buildings in areas such as the Cornmarket and the High Street, resulting in the preservation of many of the original buildings. Examples include the church of Wimborne Minster, Wimborne Minster Town Hall, the Museum of East Dorset and dozens of 16th-, 17th- and 18th-century fronted shops and pubs. The town is home to the Tivoli Theatre, a 1930s art deco cinema and theatre.

===Wimborne Minster Church===
This is a Saxon church, with Norman and Gothic architecture. It is famed for its chained library and the tomb of King Æthelred, elder brother of Alfred the Great, as well as the tombs of John Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, and his duchess, the maternal grandparents of King Henry VII of England. The tombs are made of Dorset Limestone and New Forest Stone.

===Wimborne Model Town===

The model town is one of the largest and longest-established model towns in England. It depicts Wimborne at the time the model was made, in the 1950s. It is at 1:10 scale, resulting in the model of the Minster being several feet high. The model shop windows accurately show the goods which the real shops were selling at the time. The exhibition also includes a model railway based on Thomas the Tank Engine, which was opened by Christopher Awdry, and expanded in 2014.

== Events ==
At weekends and national holidays, the town crier can be seen in the main square and around the Minster. The legacy and position of the town crier date back to the English Civil War. The town has a large civil war reenactment society, which performs every year.

The town has a well-established and large market, the Wimborne Market. The market is held on a Friday, Saturday and Sunday. It was previously located in the town centre but moved out several years ago to a site on the edge of town to accommodate its size.

Every year Wimborne hosts the longest fireworks display in Dorset, as part of its Guy Fawkes celebrations; a county record that it has held since 2004. The bonfire and pyrotechnics display is held each year in the grounds of St Michael&#x27;s Church of England Middle School and is well supported by many thousands of people from the town, Colehill village and the surrounding area. All proceeds are donated each year to local schools, and since 2004 over £61,000 has been raised for local school projects and equipment.

Every two years in mid-August, the Park Initiative, an interchurch charity working on Leigh Park estate, holds a community event called &quot;Alive in the Park&quot; in the centre of the estate using a large marquee.

===Wimborne Minster Folk Festival===

Every summer in June the town holds the Wimborne Minster Folk Festival. Founded in 1980, the annual event of traditional folk dance and music has become the focal point for one of the largest gathering of dance teams and musicians in the South of England. The festival involves morris dancing, Appalachian dancing, concerts, workshops and children&#x27;s activities, with parts of the town being closed to traffic.

The Festival planned for 2020 did not go ahead due to the health precautions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, with the cooperation of local businesses and Wimborne Minster Town Council, the Folk Festival committee made use of Café @ The Allendale, a local community hub, to provide food and meals for those in difficulties, e.g. as a result of having to self-isolate or not being able to work during the lockdowns. The 2021 Festival also had to be cancelled but an online event took place over the usual second weekend in June.

== Education and schools ==
The town has three first schools (St John&#x27;s, Wimborne and Pamphill) and two middle schools (St Michael&#x27;s and Allenbourn). Wimborne First School, formerly Wimborne Primary School, has been educating the children of Wimborne Minster to primary level since 1911. Wimborne and the adjacent area of Merley are served by two upper schools: Corfe Hills School and Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s School.

Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s School has very close links with the Minster and was founded by Lady Margaret Beaufort in 1497. After her death the school became Wimborne Grammar School. Although the Grammar School buildings still remain they have now been converted to flats. The school was established on its current site in 1972 after the merging of Wimborne Grammar School and the County Modern School.

Dumpton School is located nearby. The nearby first schools of Hayeswood and Colehill serve Wimborne.

== Healthcare ==

=== Wimborne Cottage Hospital ===

* Annie Mary Lindsay was matron from 1895 until at least 1911. Lindsay trained at The London Hospital under Matron Eva Luckes between 1886 and 1888.

== Media ==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Rowridge TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter situated in Winterborne Stickland. BBC West and ITV West Country can also be received from the Mendip TV transmitter.

The town&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Radio Solent on 96.1 FM, Heart South on 102.3 FM, Nation Radio South Coast on 106.6 FM, Greatest Hits Radio South on 105.8 FM and Radio Wimborne, a community radio station that broadcast on 94.6 FM.

Local newspapers that served the town are the Dorset Echo and Bournemouth Daily Echo.

==Clubs==

The local football club Wimborne Town F.C. play in the Southern Football League.

In rugby union, Wimborne R.F.C. has been in existence in its present form since 1950 and is based in Leigh Park, Gordon Road on the eastern side of the town.

Cricket has been played in Wimborne since at least 1793, when the club was known as Hanham&#x27;s Cricket Club, playing on the green in the centre of town from 1860. In 2010, the club moved to its new ground at The Leaze as part of the planning application which allowed Waitrose to build a new supermarket on the site of the original Wimborne Cricket Club. The club&#x27;s 4 adult teams play in the Dorset Cricket League and the 1st XI have won the Dorset Premier League title in 1997, 2012, 2016 and 2018. Dorset County Cricket Club played home matches at Wimborne sporadically from the 1957 until 1979 before returning in 2018 to Wimborne&#x27;s current ground at The Leaze.

==Economy==

The aerospace company Cobham plc has headquarters in Wimborne. Home decoration company Farrow &amp; Ball began in the town, and is still headquartered nearby in Ferndown. The economy of the town is dedicated towards leisure and has shops, restaurants and pubs. Tourism is an aspect in the town&#x27;s economy. The town is also served by a Waitrose located on the old Cricket Green and a Co-op supermarket.

==Transport==
From 1847 to 1977 Wimborne was served by a two-platform railway station. The station was built for the Southampton and Dorchester Railway, later part of the London and South Western Railway. It was expanded when the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway was constructed between Bath and Poole. Wimborne was used as a reversing point on the Somerset and Dorset, but its importance was reduced when an avoiding line was built from Bailey Gate to Broadstone Junction. The station had a large goods yard, the site of which is used for the weekly Wimborne Market. The station was closed to passengers in 1964 and sundries (parcels and light goods) in 1966, as a result of the Beeching Axe programme. The final goods trains ran in May 1977.

<text>Middleham Castle is a ruined castle in Middleham in Wensleydale, in the county of North Yorkshire, England. It was built by Robert Fitzrandolph, 3rd Lord of Middleham and Spennithorne, commencing in 1190. The castle was the childhood home of King Richard III, although he spent very little of his reign there. The castle was built to defend the road from Richmond to Skipton, though some have suggested the original site of the castle was far better to achieve this than the later location. After the death of King Richard III the castle remained in royal hands until it was allowed to go to ruin in the 17th century. Many of the stones from the castle were used in other buildings in the village of Middleham.

==History==
Middleham Castle was built near the site of an earlier motte and bailey castle, called William&#x27;s Hill, the site of which can still be seen nearby, although there is no evidence of stonework or defensive structures to the former castle site. Historians believe that the defensive walls of the original castle were constructed from timber. In 1270 the new Middleham Castle came into the hands of the Neville family, the most notable member of which was Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, known to history as the &quot;Kingmaker&quot;, a leading figure in the Wars of the Roses. Following the death of Richard, Duke of York, at Wakefield in December 1460, his younger son, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, came into Warwick&#x27;s care, and lived at Middleham with Warwick&#x27;s family. His brother King Edward IV was imprisoned at Middleham for a short time, having been captured by Warwick in 1469. Following Warwick&#x27;s death at Barnet in 1471 and Edward&#x27;s restoration to the throne, his brother Richard married Anne Neville, Warwick&#x27;s younger daughter, and made Middleham his main home. Their son Edward (known as Edward of Middleham), was also born at the castle around 1473 or 1476 and later also died there in 1484.

Richard ascended to the throne as King Richard III, but spent little or no time at Middleham in his two-year reign. After Richard&#x27;s death at Bosworth in 1485 the castle was seized by Henry VII and remained in royal hands until the reign of James I, when it was sold. During the reign of Elizabeth I, the castle was proposed for full demolition by Lord Huntingdon and eventual conversion into a Manor House. A letter was written by Huntingdon to the Lord Treasurer outlining the plan and its possible use by the Queen when on her royal duties. The castle fell into disuse and disrepair during the 17th century. In 1644, a parliamentary Committee sitting in Yorkshire ordered that it was &quot;untenable and no garrison should be kept there&quot;. Later still, some of the castle&#x27;s walls were blown away and the stones of the castle became a public quarry by which many of the buildings in Middleham were created. It was garrisoned during the Civil War in 1654 and 1655, when it was host to thirty men and capable of housing prisoners. There is no record of action at the site nor was it put under siege.

In 1604, the castle was passed to Sir Henry Linley and then sold to the Wood family in 1662 who held onto the property until 1889. The ruins are now in the care of English Heritage who took them on in 1984 and are Grade I listed.

== Description ==

The castle is a compact, massive structure, and though ruinous, most of the walls are intact. A simple rectangle in plan, the castle consists of a massive Norman keep surrounded by a later curtain wall, to which were then added extensive, palatial residential ranges. The location of the castle was as a safe refuge on the road from Richmond to Skipton, and in this respect, it guarded the road and the area of Coverdale. Pevsner comments that the site of the original castle which had a motte of was far better placed to defend the road than the latter castle of 1190.

The keep is similar to other large square keeps, but had only two storeys, even so, at from north to south and west to east, is one of the largest in England. It is divided on both levels by an internal wall, and there are turrets at each corner and midway along each wall. The ground floor has two large, originally vaulted, chambers, and above are two grand halls surrounded by high windows. The entrance is by staircase to the first floor—as was common—and a later chapel outbuilding defends that approach. A repaired spiral staircase leads up to the top of the south-east corner tower, affording views of the surrounding town and countryside, including the original castle motte to the south-west. The south-west tower is sometimes referred to as the Prince&#x27;s Tower on account of Richard III&#x27;s son, Edward, having been born in the tower, though there is no documentary evidence of this: in a survey conducted in 1538, it is simply referred to as the &quot;Rounde Towre&quot;.

The 13th century curtain wall surrounds the keep concentrically, making the castle into a compact and effective defensive structure, though it was built more for comfort than security. In the 15th century the Nevilles constructed an impressive range of halls and outbuildings against these walls, turning the castle into a truly magnificent residence, fit for nobles of their stature. Bridges at first-floor level were built to connect these to the keep, and the ceiling above the great hall was also raised, either to provide a clerestory or space for another chamber.

The entrance to the castle is through a tower in the north-east corner, though this was also a 15th century modification. Only foundations remain of the original gatehouse, facing east into the now-vanished outer ward. The gatehouse was remodelled in the 14th century with diagonal turrets and flanked by an arch. Spaces in the stonework were provided so that missiles could be launched on would-be attackers. Apart from this east wall, however, the circuit of the walls is fairly complete, though the walls of the residential buildings are gone. Some restoration was done on the castle in modern times, but there is extensive damage to the lower faces of the keep. Windows and doorways have crumbled away, floors have fallen in, and none of the battlements remain. Still, the castle is an impressive ruin, and the sense of its original strength and grandeur remains.

As a tourist attraction, the castle has about 400,000 visitors a year (average for 2010–2021).

<doc id="113540" wikidata="Q2985822" url="?curid=113540" title="Bisham Abbey">
<text>Bisham Abbey is a Grade I listed manor house at Bisham in the English county of Berkshire. The name is taken from the now lost monastery which once stood alongside. This original Bisham Abbey was previously named Bisham Priory, and was the traditional resting place of many Earls of Salisbury. The complex surrounding the extant manorial buildings is now one of three National Sports Centres run on behalf of Sport England and is used as a residential training camp base for athletes and teams and community groups alike. It is a wedding venue with a licence for civil ceremony and is used for conferences, team building events, corporate parties and private functions.

==Manor house==

The manor house was built around 1260 as a community house for two Knights Templar. There was substantial rebuilding and alteration in later centuries. When the Templars were suppressed in 1307, King Edward II took over the manorial rights, granting them to various relatives.
In 1310 the building was used as a place of confinement for Queen Elizabeth of the Scots, wife of King Robert the Bruce, along with her stepdaughter Princess Marjorie and sister–in–law, Lady Christine of Carrick. They had been captured on the Isle of Rathlin during the Scottish Wars of Succession, and were placed in the charge of the King&#x27;s Yeoman, John Bentley, for two years, until removed to Windsor.

In 1335 the manor was bought by William Montacute, 1st Earl of Salisbury and in 1337 he founded Bisham Priory alongside, within the year of his death 1344, he was buried in the abbey.

Henry VIII granted the manor house to Anne of Cleves as part of her divorce settlement from him, and it was later bought by the Hoby family, who lived there until 1768. Elizabeth I was a regular visitor in the time of the Hoby family. Anne of Denmark stayed in August 1610. Her arms with the motto &quot;La Mia Grandezza dal Eccelso&quot; and the arms of her husband James VI and I featured in the stained glass of the parish church, and were later installed in the house. There is a long-standing legend that the house is haunted by the ghost of Dame Elizabeth Hoby, as she purportedly beat her son to death for blotting his copy-book.

==Monastery==
Bisham Priory was built for the Augustinian Canons. The foundation stone laid in 1337, and the brass plaque once affixed to it, can still be seen at Denchworth. When the founder, the 1st Earl of Salisbury, died, he was buried at the priory, as were many later Earls of Salisbury, including Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, who was buried in April 1471.

Despite holding some relics of Saints Cosmas and Damian, the priory never really became a centre of pilgrimage: many other churches also held relics of the same saints, including two different locations which both claimed to have their skulls.

Bisham Priory was dissolved on 5 July 1537, but six months later, on 18 December, it was refounded as a Benedictine abbey. This was not to last though as it was finally dissolved on 19 June 1538. The abbot of Bisham, John Cordery, is said to have cursed the building thus: &quot;As God is my witness, this property shall ne’er be inherited by two direct successors, for its sons will be hounded by misfortune&quot;, as he was dragged from it. Nothing remains of the abbey church or its associated buildings.

The England association football men&#x27;s senior team trained at Bisham Abbey for 40 years, up until early 2001. England Rugby had their training base at Bisham Abbey until 2005, when they moved to the University of Bath. Several football teams have trained at Bisham Abbey, most recently Barcelona and Portsmouth before their 2008 FA Cup victory. For the last few years Non-League Marlow United F.C. use the pitches as their home ground. The facilities are frequently used by elite athletes and community groups for residential training camps such as the Rugby Sevens and England Hockey. There is an International High performance Tennis centre based on site managed by WIN Tennis. Some professional rugby players use the gym facilities. In February 2006 the England futsal team played two international friendlies against Finland at Bisham Abbey. Due to their regular training ground (Beversbrook) being out of use due to the weather Swindon Town F.C. have been using the centre (as of February 2020) while they attempt to find a more permanent facility.

==Media==

Bisham Abbey is described in Jerome K. Jerome&#x27;s 1889 humorous novel &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot;.

During the Nationwide Building Society&#x27;s summer advertising campaign of 2010, when they were official sponsors of the England football team at the World Cup, one of their television advertisements featured the England team playing on one of the pitches at Bisham Abbey. The parish church was clearly visible in the background.

<doc id="113541" wikidata="Q385679" url="?curid=113541" title="Jasper Tudor">
<text>Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford (c. November 143121 December 1495) was the uncle of King Henry VII of England and a leading architect of his nephew&#x27;s successful accession to the throne in 1485. He was a member of the Tudor family of Penmynydd.

Jasper Tudor&#x27;s coat of arms, granted to him by his maternal half-brother, King Henry VI, quarters the three lilies of France with the three lions of England, with the addition of a &quot;bordure azure with martlets or&quot; (that is, a blue border featuring golden martlets).

==Family and early life==
Jasper was the second son of Sir Owen Tudor and the former queen Catherine of Valois, the widow of King Henry V of England. He was thus half-brother to Henry VI. Through his father, Jasper was a descendant of Ednyfed Fychan, Llywelyn the Great&#x27;s renowned chancellor. His mother was a daughter of King Charles VI of France.

Jasper was born at the bishop of Ely&#x27;s manor at Hatfield, Hertfordshire, in 1431, his parents&#x27; second child. After the death of Jasper&#x27;s mother in 1437, Owen Tudor was arrested and sent to Newgate prison. Jasper, his brother Edmund, and possibly a sister were put into the care of Katherine de la Pole, abbess of Barking Abbey, in Essex, from July 1437 to March 1442. She was the sister of William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk, a great favourite of Henry VI, and was able to provide Jasper and his siblings with food, clothing, and lodging. They were also permitted servants to wait upon them as the King&#x27;s half-siblings.

In 1442, their half-brother the King began to take an interest in their upbringing. Sometime after March 1442, Jasper and his brother were brought to live at court. Henry arranged for the best priest to educate them intellectually and morally. The brothers also received military training; when they grew up they were given military positions. Jasper was recognised as Henry VI&#x27;s uterine half-brother when, on 23 November 1452, he was created Earl of Pembroke.

==Adulthood==
Owen Tudor was released from prison, most likely thanks to his stepson Henry VI who, after providing for his stepfather, also provided for his two half-brothers. It is not clear whether Henry VI had known of the existence of his half-brothers until his mother told him while she was dying in Bermondsey Abbey. It was after her death that Henry would begin to care for them and eventually raise them to the peerage by giving both brothers earldoms. Jasper became Earl of Pembroke on 23 November 1452, the seventh creation. In turn, Edmund and Jasper swore unwavering loyalty to Henry and fought and promoted him and his Lancastrian family&#x27;s interests persistently throughout their lives.

Owen and Catherine&#x27;s marriage was not recognised by the authorities, in large part due to the secrecy under which it was accomplished, and so the legitimacy of Jasper and his two (or three) siblings was questionable. However, Jasper enjoyed all the privileges appropriate to his birth, including being invested as a Knight of the Garter. After 1485, he would describe himself as the &quot;high and mighty Prince Jasper, brother and uncle of Kings, Duke of Bedford and Earl of Pembroke&quot;. During his time at court, Jasper constantly tried to work with the Duke of York and other nobles in order to try to stop the infighting between the two houses. It was after the death of his elder brother, Edmund, that Jasper took over the responsibility of maintaining the Lancastrian ties within Wales. Along with this, he took into his care his sister-in-law and infant nephew.

On the accession of the Yorkist King Edward IV in 1461, he was subject to an attainder for supporting his Lancastrian half-brother, the deposed King Henry, to whom Jasper was loyal. He strove to place his half-nephew Prince Edward of Lancaster on the throne and provided absolute loyalty to his royal half-brother and Margaret of Anjou, his half-brother&#x27;s wife. Jasper would also help his other sister-in-law Lady Margaret Beaufort assist her son Henry Tudor to win the throne in 1485 as King Henry VII, father of King Henry VIII.

In 1485, Jasper financed the rebuilding of the north-west tower of Llandaff Cathedral, near Cardiff. It now holds the Cathedral bells, and is named the Jasper Tower in his honour.

==Wars of the Roses==
Jasper Tudor was an adventurer whose military expertise, some of it gained in the early stages of the Wars of the Roses, was considerable. Nevertheless, the only major battle he had taken part in before the Battle of Bosworth was the Battle of Mortimer&#x27;s Cross in February 1461, where he lost the battle to the future king, Edward IV of England. His father, Owen Tudor, was then captured and beheaded at Hereford, where his head was placed on the market cross. Jasper occupied the castles of Carmarthen and Aberystwyth in 1456 until he lost them to William Herbert of Raglan. Subsequently, he remained in touch with his sister-in-law, Margaret of Anjou, wife of his half-brother Henry VI and he held Denbigh Castle for the House of Lancaster in 1460.

Jasper Tudor also brought up his nephew, Henry Tudor, whose father, Edmund Tudor had died before his birth. After being welcomed by King Louis XI of France in 1462, Jasper stayed in France for 6 years before returning to North Wales in 1468. On his return, Jasper lost Pembroke Castle to William Herbert, when Herbert was given the title of Earl of Pembroke by King Edward IV.

Jasper Tudor briefly regained the earldom of Pembroke a couple of years later when his half-brother, King Henry VI, was restored to the throne, but following the return of King Edward IV from temporary exile in 1471, Jasper fled again to the continent. During his time on the continent, he travelled and attempted to gather support for the Lancastrian cause. While escaping from Tenby with his nephew Henry, storms in the English Channel forced them to land at Le Conquet in Brittany, where they sought refuge with Francis II, Duke of Brittany. Francis housed Jasper, his nephew, and the core of their group of exiled Lancastrians at the Château de Suscinio in Sarzeau and although King Edward IV placed diplomatic pressure on him, the uncle and nephew remained safe from the clutches of the Yorkist king, who died later in April 1483. For 11 years, the Château de Suscinio became an armed camp, alert against any attempt to kidnap Jasper and Henry and return them to England, where they were under attainder and would have been promptly executed as threats to the Yorkist rule.

In October 1483, the Tudors launched an invasion of England from Brittany. However, the invasion failed and Jasper Tudor and his nephew Henry returned to Brittany. In mid-1484, when the Duke of Brittany was incapacitated with illness, his treasurer, Pierre Landais, who took over the reins of government, reached an agreement with the new Yorkist king, Richard III of England, to send Jasper and his nephew back to England in exchange for a pledge of 3,000 English archers to defend Brittany against a threatened French attack. John Morton, the Bishop of Ely who was then in exile in Flanders, learned of the scheme and warned the Tudors in time. Jasper and Henry then managed to escape separately, hours ahead of Landais&#x27; soldiers, across the nearby border into France. They were received at the court of King Charles VIII of France who allowed them to stay and provided them with resources. Shortly afterwards, when Duke Francis II had recovered, he offered the 400 remaining Lancastrians, still at and around the Château de Suscinio, safe-conduct into France and even paid for their expenses.

On Henry Tudor&#x27;s subsequent accession to the throne in 1485, Jasper Tudor had all previous attainders annulled, and was thus restored to all his former titles, including Knight of the Garter, and was created Duke of Bedford. In 1488, he took possession of Cardiff Castle.
==Marriage and children==
Jasper was married on 7 November 1485 to Catherine Woodville (c. 1458–1509). She was the daughter of Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers and Jacquetta of Luxembourg, and was sister to King Edward IV&#x27;s queen Elizabeth Woodville and to Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers and Richard Woodville, 3rd Earl Rivers. She was the widow of Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, who had been executed for treason in 1483. There were no children of her marriage with Jasper Tudor.

===Illegitimate issue===
Jasper Tudor acknowledged paternity of no illegitimate children during his lifetime and none are recognised in his will.

The earliest formal source for any illegitimate child of Jasper Tudor appears to be the Heraldic Visitation of the northern counties in 1530 by Thomas Tonge, Norroy King of Arms (d. 1534). The records of Tonge&#x27;s Heraldic Visitation were first published in 1836, by the Surtees Society. They contain a claim by Prior Gardener, of Tynmouth Monastery in Northumberland, to be the son of Ellen/Helen, a bastard daughter of Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford, and her husband William Gardener. The heraldic arms claimed by Prior Gardener include a shield impaling the arms of Jasper Tudor, &#x27;debruised by a bend sinister&#x27;.

Thomas Gardyner was appointed prior of Tynmouth in 1528. He was then a monk of Westminster Abbey, and &#x27;familiar to followers of the Tudor household as a grandson of the King&#x27;s great-uncle, Jasper&#x27;. His appointment as prior was actively supported by Mary Boleyn, and it is most likely that Thomas Wolsey also approved, as the priory was a dependency of St Alban&#x27;s Abbey, where Wolsey was abbot.

The next source dates from the late 17th century, nearly two hundred years after Jasper Tudor&#x27;s death. William Dugdale&#x27;s &quot;Baronage of England&quot; (1675–6) states that Jasper Tudor &quot;departed this Life ... leaving no other Issue than one Illegitimate Daughter, called Ellen/Helen, who became the Wife of William Gardner, Citizen of London&quot;. Dugdale (1605–1686), an eminent antiquarian and scholar, was Norroy King of Arms (1660–1679) and Garter King of Arms (1679–1686). The records of Tonge&#x27;s 1530 Visitation held by the College of Arms would have been available to Dugdale.

In the 19th century the account was embroidered, to make Ellen (or Helen) the mother of Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester and Lord Chancellor. The account that Gardiner was a descendant of Jasper Tudor is now discredited: it appears that this assertion arose from confusing Stephen Gardiner, the Bishop, with Thomas Gardiner, Prior of Tynmouth.

==Death and burial==
Jasper Tudor died at Thornbury Castle on 21 December 1495, and was buried at Keynsham Abbey in Somerset, which Lady Agnes Cheyne, the incumbent of Chenies Manor House, bequeathed to him in 1494.

<text>Sir Owen Tudor (, – 2 February 1461) was a Welsh courtier and the second husband of Queen Catherine of Valois (1401–1437), widow of King Henry V of England. He was the grandfather of Henry VII, founder of the Tudor dynasty.

== Background ==

Owen was a descendant of a prominent family from Penmynydd on the Isle of Anglesey, which traces its lineage back to Ednyfed Fychan (d. 1246), a Welsh official and seneschal to the Kingdom of Gwynedd. Tudor&#x27;s grandfather, Tudur ap Goronwy, married Margaret, daughter of Thomas ap Llywelyn ab Owain of Cardiganshire, the last male of the senior branch of the princely house of Deheubarth. Margaret&#x27;s elder sister married Gruffudd Fychan of Glyndyfrdwy, whose son was Owain Glyndŵr. Owen&#x27;s father, Maredudd ap Tudur, and his uncles were prominent in Owain Glyndŵr&#x27;s revolt against English rule, the Glyndŵr Rising.

Historians consider the descendants of Ednyfed Fychan, including Owen Tudor, one of the most powerful families in 13th to 14th-century Wales. The descendants of his many sons would form a wealthy &#x27;ministerial aristocracy&#x27;, acting as leading servants to the princes of Gwynedd, and play a key role in the attempts to create a single Welsh principality. This privilege endured after the Conquest of Wales by Edward I with the family continuing to exercise power in the name of the king of England, within Wales. However, there remained an awareness of the family&#x27;s Welsh heritage and the accompanying loyalties led them to take part in the suppressed Glyndŵr Rising.

== Early life ==
The fact that little is known about Tudor&#x27;s early life and that it has instead become largely mythologized is attributed to his family&#x27;s part in the Glyndŵr Rising. At various times it has been said that he was the bastard son of an alehouse keeper, that his father was a fugitive murderer, that he fought at Agincourt, that he was keeper of Queen Catherine&#x27;s household or wardrobe, that he was an esquire of Henry V, and that his relationship with Catherine began when he fell into the queen&#x27;s lap while dancing or caught the queen&#x27;s eye when swimming. 

The sixteenth-century Welsh chronicler Elis Gruffydd did note that he was her sewer (someone who places dishes on the table and tastes them) and servant. However, it is known that after the Glyndŵr Rising several Welshmen secured positions at court, and in May 1421 an &#x27;Owen Meredith&#x27; joined the retinue of Sir Walter Hungerford, 1st Baron Hungerford, the steward of the king&#x27;s household from 1415 until 1421.

== Catherine of Valois ==
Henry V of England died on 31 August 1422, leaving his wife, Queen Catherine, widowed. The dowager queen initially lived with her infant son, King Henry VI, before moving to Wallingford Castle early in his reign. 

Catherine was rumoured to have had an affair with Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset. These rumours, though based on questionable evidence, prompted a response from her son&#x27;s regents, who objected to Somerset as a possible husband as he was a second cousin of Henry V through the legitimised Beaufort line sired by John of Gaunt. A parliamentary statute regulating the remarriage of widowed queens was passed by the conciliary government. She subsequently married Owen Tudor and gave birth to at least two sons: Edmund and Jasper (see below).

Historian G. L. Harriss suggested that the affair with Beaufort resulted in the birth of Edmund Tudor. Harriss wrote, &quot;By its very nature the evidence for Edmund Tudor&#x27;s parentage is less than conclusive, but such facts, as can be assembled, permit an agreeable possibility that Edmund &#x27;Tudor&#x27; and Margaret Beaufort were first cousins and that the royal house of &#x27;Tudor&#x27; sprang in fact from Beauforts on both sides.&quot;

== Life after Catherine&#x27;s death ==
Following Queen Catherine&#x27;s death, Owen Tudor lost the protection from the statute on dowager queens&#x27; remarriage and was imprisoned in Newgate Prison. In 1438, he escaped but was later recaptured and held in the custody of the constable of Windsor Castle. 

In 1439, Henry VI of England granted him a general pardon, restoring his goods and lands. In addition, Henry VI granted him a pension of £40 per annum, provided him with a position in court, and appointed him the Keeper of the King&#x27;s Parks in Denbigh. In 1442, Henry VI welcomed his two half-brothers, Edmund and Jasper, to court. In November 1452, they were created earls of Richmond and Pembroke respectively with the acknowledgement that they were the king&#x27;s half-brothers. 

In 1459, Tudor&#x27;s pension was increased to £100 per annum. Owen and his son Jasper (Edmund having died in 1456) were commissioned to arrest a servant of John Dwnn of Kidwelly, a Yorkist, and later that year, Tudor acquired an interest in the forfeited estates of another Yorkist, John, Lord Clinton. On 5 February 1460, Tudor and Jasper were granted life offices in the Duke of York&#x27;s lordship of Denbigh, a prelude to them later seizing the lordship.

== Death ==
Owen Tudor was an early casualty of the Wars of the Roses (1455–1487) between the House of Lancaster and the House of York. He joined his son Jasper&#x27;s army as Lancastrian relations and partisans in Wales in January 1461, a force that was defeated at the Battle of Mortimer&#x27;s Cross by Edward of York. On 2 February, Owen Tudor was captured and beheaded at Hereford. His head was placed on the market cross there, &quot;and a madde woman kembyd hys here and wysche a way the blode of hys face&quot; (&quot;and a mad woman combed his hair and washed away the blood of his face&quot;) and set 100 candles about him. 

Owen Tudor had expected to be imprisoned rather than executed. Moments before his execution, he realised that he was to die and murmured &quot;that hede shalle ly on the stocke that wass wonte to ly on Quene Katheryns lappe&quot; (&quot;that head shall lie on the stock that was wont to lie on Queen Catherine&#x27;s lap&quot;). His body was buried in a chapel on the north side of the Greyfriars&#x27; Church in Hereford. He had no memorial until his illegitimate son, David, paid for a tomb before the friary was dissolved.

== Issue ==
Owen and Catherine had two certain sons, plus a third son and a daughter whose existences are disputed: 
* Edmund (1430 – 1 November 1456) was born at either Much Hadham Palace in Hertfordshire or at Hadham in Bedfordshire. Edmund became the 1st Earl of Richmond in 1452 and later married Margaret Beaufort. In 1456 he died of plague in Carmarthen, three months before the birth of the couple&#x27;s son at Pembroke Castle. That son, Henry, later became king of England and founded the Tudor dynasty.
* Jasper (November 1431 – 26 December 1495) was born at Hatfield. He became the 1st Earl of Pembroke in 1452 but was branded as a traitor in 1461. However, he became the 1st Duke of Bedford in 1485. He was the second husband of Catherine Woodville, widow of the Duke of Buckingham and sister of Elizabeth Woodville, wife of Edward IV. They had no issue. 
* Edward. Very little is known of this child&#x27;s life. The Tudor historian Polydore Vergil stated this child, whom he did not name, became &quot;a monke of the order of St. Benet, and lived not longe after&quot;. William Camden referred to this child as Edward Tudor, and indicated that he lies buried in the chapel of St Blaise in Westminster Abbey, near the tomb of Abbot Nicholas Litlington. Even so, he is called Owen Tudor in most published sources, the reasons for which are not clear. The modern historian Pearce has shown, however, that no monk named either Edward or Owen Tudor existed at Westminster Abbey in this time period. An alternative theory advanced by Pearce is that Edward Tudor is the same person as Edward Bridgewater, a known monk at Westminster Abbey, who died c.1471. This theory appears to be groundless.
* Polydore Vergil says Owen and Queen Katherine also had a daughter, called Catherine or Margaret, who became a nun, though no other source corroborates this.

Owen Tudor had at least one illegitimate child, by an unknown mistress:

* Sir David Owen (born in 1459 at Pembroke Castle). He later acquired Southwick Court in Wiltshire before marrying an heiress who brought with her the Cowdray estate in Sussex. He is buried in the priory church of Easebourne, near Midhurst.

== Ancestry ==
Owen was a descendant of Rhys ap Gruffydd (1132–1197), ruler of the kingdom of Deheubarth, via the lineages that follow:

Rhys had a daughter, Gwenllian ferch (daughter of) Rhys, who married Ednyfed Fychan, Seneschal of the Kingdom of Gwynedd (d. 1246).

Ednyfed Fychan and Gwenllian ferch Rhys were the parents of Goronwy ab Ednyfed, Lord of Tref-gastell (d. 1268). Goronwy was married to Morfydd ferch Meurig, daughter of Meurig of Gwent. Meurig was the son of Ithel, grandson of Rhydd and great-grandson of Iestyn ap Gwrgant, the last king of Morgannwg (reigned 1081–1091) before its conquest by the Normans.

Goronwy and Morfydd were parents of Tudur Hen, Lord of Penmynydd (d. 1311). Tudur Hen married Angharad ferch Ithel Fychan, daughter of Ithel Fychan ap Ithel Gan, Lord of Englefield. They were the parents of Goronwy ap Tudur Hen, Lord of Penmynydd (d. 1331).

&quot;Goronwy ap Tudur&quot; was married to Gwerfyl ferch Madog, daughter of Madog ap Dafydd, Baron of Hendwr. They were the parents of Tudur ap Goronwy, also known as &quot;Tudur Fychan&quot; (&quot;Tudur the Little&quot;) to distinguish him from his grandfather Tudur Hen (&quot;Tudur the Old&quot;), Lord of Penmynydd (d. 1367).

&quot;Tudur Fychan&quot; married Margaret ferch Thomas of Is Coed, of the native and Ancient Royal Houses of Wales. Margaret and her sisters, Ellen and Eleanor, were descended from Angharad ferch Llywelyn, daughter of Llywelyn the Great.

Tudur and Margaret were parents to &quot;Maredudd ap Tudur&quot; (died 1406). Maredudd married Margaret ferch Dafydd, the daughter of Dafydd Fychan, Lord of Anglesey, and his wife, Nest ferch Ieuan.

Maredudd ap Tudur and Margaret ferch Dafydd were the parents of Owen Tudor.

<doc id="113544" wikidata="Q1566214" url="?curid=113544" title="Eadburh of Winchester">
<text>Eadburh (; also Edburga, Edburg; born 921/924, died 15 June 951/953) was the daughter of King Edward the Elder of England and his third wife, Eadgifu of Kent. She lived most of her life as a nun known for her singing ability. Most of the information about her comes from hagiographies written several centuries after her life. She was canonised twelve years after her death and there are a small number of churches dedicated to her, most of which are located near Worcestershire, where she lived.

==Life==
In the twelfth century, a Latin &quot;Life&quot; of her was written by Osbert de Clare, who became prior of Westminster in 1136. The account by Osbert was commissioned in c. 1120 by the monks of Pershore Abbey in Worcestershire because they wanted the accounts they possessed of her life to be better organized; as Osbert put it, &quot;her deeds seemed woven together in a confused expression&quot;. Scholar Katie Ann-Marie Bugyis stated that the nuns of Westminster had probably commissioned Osbert to write a biography of Eadburh for their use previously. According to Osbert, at the age of three, Eadburh was given as an oblate to the Queen Mother Ealhswith&#x27;s foundation of St Mary&#x27;s Abbey, Winchester (Nunnaminster). There Eadburh was educated and remained as a nun for the rest of her life.

Osbert also reported that perhaps because of her excellence in the practice of sung prayer, she was assigned the role of precentrix at Westminster, although scholar Susan Ridyard has questioned the historical validity of Osbert&#x27;s claim, stating that he might have meant that she loved singing so much that it seemed that she was like a precentrix. Bugyis, however, insisted that Osbert&#x27;s descriptions of Eadburh&#x27;s duties fit the responsibilities of both cantor and sacristan duties. In Osbert&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot;, he presented what Bugyis called &quot;the most comprehensive, though admittingly idealized, depiction&quot; of Eadburgh&#x27;s musical abilities and leadership. He describes her devotion and commitment to the performance of the Divine Office in his chapter about her patience. She would often stay in the oratory for many hours after the Divine Office was completed to continue to pray in private, which the community&#x27;s prioress punished her for because she considered it idleness, although the prioress eventually relented when she discovered that Eadburgh was the daughter of the king.

An anoymous hagiography from the early 14th century described &quot;Eadburh&#x27;s strict disciple of psalmody&quot; and claimed that &quot;she expressed divine praise through the singing of hymns&quot;, and reported that wore out her body fulfilling the injunction in the Psalms to pray seven times per day. According to Bugyis, Eadburh was also a &quot;highly skilled singer of chants&quot;, which had been assigned to other cantors in earlier and contemporary customaries and liturgical books published and used in other monastic communities. Osbert related a story during a banquet held at the Winchester community during a visit from her father in which he commanded her to sing for the crowd; she initially resisted performing for them, but agreed when he promised to give her a reward. The audience was &quot;held captive by the beauty of her singing&quot; and she successfully procured additional financial support for the community from him and a promise to complete the construction of the abbey. Osbert claimed that the community benefitted from the king&#x27;s gift even until his own time.

According to Bugyis, Eadburh&#x27;s liturgical activities extended beyond her duties as cantor; Osbert reported that she also &quot;held an important role in the celebration of the Eucharist&quot; at Nunnaminster, although it is unclear exactly what activities she performed. Bugyis speculates that these activities could have included: preparing the hosts and ensuring that they and the wine and water were available before each Mass; bringing the elements to the altar during the offertory; assisting with the consecration and distribution of the Eucharist; and taking out the consecrated hosts during a communion service, when a priest was unavailable. Both Eadburgh and St. Edith of Wilton, abbess of Wilton Abbey, were praised by contemporary historian William of Malmesbury for their prayers and intercessions on behalf of their respective communities, as well as their members&#x27; &quot;unfailing obedience&quot; and devotion to their leaders and teachers.

There is little contemporary information for her life, but in a Winchester charter dated 939, she was the beneficiary of land at Droxford in Hampshire granted by her half-brother King Æthelstan.

According to one account, when Eadburh was three years of age, her father sought an indication as to whether she would live in the world or as a religious. On one side he placed rings and bracelets, on the other a chalice and gospel book. A nurse brought the child, and King Edward set her on his knee, inviting her to choose. When he set her down, she chose the religious items. Bugyis speculates that these items were meant for and used by Eadburh and the nuns at Nunnaminster.

The hagiography written of her in the 12th century by Osbert of Clare shows evidence of some of the unusual occurrences that might have happened in that time period when a member of a royal family became a monk or nun. In one story, her father visits her in the monastery and she sings for him, and he asks her if there is anything he can do for her, and she asks for him to give the community an estate at Canning, which he does so. In another story, the abbess found her reading alone, which was against the rules of the monastery, and then thrashed her. When the abbess realized it was the princess and not an ordinary nun, the abbess then begged forgiveness from her. In another story, she one time insisted on cleaning the shoes of her well-born companions, and they felt shocked by this and reported it to her father as behaviour that is not right for her. Osbert reported that despite her royal lineage, Eadburh obeyed her elders in the Nunnaminster, showed respect to her peers and members of the community who were younger than her, and &quot;devoted herself to performing works of service&quot; for her followers &quot;that others deemed to be beneath her&quot;. One act of service was secretly cleaning her sisters&#x27; shoes, as Christ washed the feet of his disciples.

Eadburh died at Winchester in her thirtieth year on 15 June in 951, 952 or 953. Osbert reported that she led the Winchester community in song and praise, &quot;even near the moment of her death&quot;, and that the other nuns continued to honor her memory by singing during her burial.

==Veneration==
A cult developed after her death and is first mentioned in the Salisbury Psalter from the early 970s. In 972, some of her remains were transferred to Pershore Abbey in Worcestershire, which is dedicated to SS. Mary, Peter and Paul, and Eadburh. Her feast is celebrated on 15 June.

Osbert recorded that after Eadburh&#x27;s death, the nuns at Nunnaminster discovered, &quot;through a series of miracles&quot;, that they had buried her in an inappropriate place that did not befit her sanctity, so they translated her body to a place near the choir in order that her pilgrims could better access her tomb and so that &quot;she could be near the place where she had spent of much time in prayer&quot;. Eadburh, however, appeared to the nuns in a dream and informed them that she preferred to be buried near the altar, where she had regularly ministered.

The monks at Pershore Abbey, who commissioned Osbert to write Eadburh&#x27;s hagiography, named her as one of their patron saints and acquired her relics in the late tenth century. The abbey&#x27;s seal, created in the 1300s, Eadburh is depicted &quot;in three-quarter length, facing forward, wearing a veil, holding a chalice in her right hand and an open book, likely the gospels, in her left&quot;. Bugyis states that Eadburh&#x27;s position on the seal is remarkable because at monasteries in England during the time, the position, along with a sign of their office (a crosier or book) was usually held by the person who held a house&#x27;s highest office. Bugyis insists that the seal conveys the Pershone Abbey monks&#x27; view of Eadburh as a representative of their identity and that they considered her as a figure of the abbot of their community. Finally, Bugyis states that they &quot;took pride in identifying, and being identified, with her image because they used it continuously to close correspondance and to authenticate documents until at least 1534&quot;.

==Dedication of parish churches==
There are a number of Church of England parish churches dedicated to St. Eadburh of Winchester. Most of them are not far from Pershore Abbey, to which they were connected in some way.

*St Edburga, Abberton, Worcestershire (rebuilt 1882)
*St Eadburgha, Broadway, Worcestershire
*St Eadburgha, Ebrington, Gloucestershire
*St Edburga, Leigh, Worcestershire
*St Edburgha, Yardley, West Midlands
* The dedication of the church of St Aldhelm and St Eadburgha, Broadway, Somerset may be relatively modern: &quot;A Topographical Dictionary of England&quot; (1848) lists it as being dedicated to St. Aldelme (&quot;sic&quot;) only. It retained the dedication to St. Aldelme in 1875.

St Edburg, Bicester, Oxfordshire and SS Mary &amp; Edburga, Stratton Audley, Oxfordshire are both dedicated to Edburga of Bicester.

== Dedication of abbey churches ==
St Mary&#x27;s Abbey, Winchester was at one time co-dedicated to St. Eadburh. Pershore Abbey was also for some time dedicated to her after Egilwado (Alwardus or Æthelweard), the nephew of the Abbess of St. Mary&#x27;s Abbey, acquired some of her bones for £100. The dedication of the Abbey varied at different times in its history. In the Domesday Book it is called the Abbey of St. Mary; in Henry VIII&#x27;s time the Valor of St. Edburga. It has also been called the Church of SS Mary, Edburga and Holy Cross (the parochial portion was dedicated to the Holy Cross). In its earlier years SS. Mary, Peter, and Paul were its patron saints, but at the time of the introduction of the Benedictines it was probably dedicated to St. Mary, with whom was joined St. Edburga, whose relics had then not long been added to its treasure.

<text>Woodstock Palace was a royal residence in the English town of Woodstock, Oxfordshire.

Henry I of England built a hunting lodge here and in 1129 he built of walls to create the first enclosed park, where lions and leopards were kept. The lodge became a palace under Henry&#x27;s grandson, Henry II, who spent time here with his mistress, Rosamund Clifford. Henry III frequently visited the palace for entertainment, including once in 1237 when he invited his long-confined cousin Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany.

== Timeline ==
Important events that took place at the palace or manor include:

* The marriage of William the Lion, king of Scots to Ermengarde de Beaumont in 1186;
* The signing of the Treaty of Woodstock between Henry III of England and Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (1247);
* The birth of Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent (1301-1330), the sixth son of King Edward I, and the second by his second wife Margaret of France, and a younger half-brother of King Edward II;
* The birth of Edward the Black Prince (1330), eldest son and heir apparent of King Edward III and father of King Richard II;
* Isabella of England born here 1332 oldest daughter of Edward III;
* Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester born here 1355, 7th son (5th surviving) and youngest child of Edward III;
* The marriage of Mary of Waltham, daughter of King Edward III, to John IV, Duke of Brittany (1361);
* A lost play, the &quot;Necromancer&quot; or &quot;Nigramansir&quot; by John Skelton is said to have been performed at the palace for Henry VII on Palm Sunday, 1501;
* Imprisonment of the future Queen Elizabeth I of England (1554–1558).

A chapel or oratory was built for Eleanor of Provence, the wife of Henry III, in 1250. The new chapel was dedicated to St Edward and located above the Queen&#x27;s Chamber. Externally the chapel had crenellations.

== Henry VII and family ==
Henry VII rebuilt a part of the palace in the 1490s. He spent over £4000 from his chamber account on building works at Woodstock. The work was supervised by Master George Gainesford, Sheriff of Oxfordshire and others, and the mason was William Este of Oxford. He modified the hall, a bay window for the Queen&#x27;s chamber (for Elizabeth of York), and, in 1507, the gatehouse. According to Isaac Wake the gatehouse had a carved Latin inscription recording that it was the work of Henry VII. The King&#x27;s chamber also had a bay window (built by William Flower), and there was a chamber for his mother, Lady Margaret Beaufort.

The new hall roof was constructed by a carpenter John Brian of Oxford in 1494. Brian complained that Henry VII had agreed to his drawing for the roof, but after he began cutting and shaping the timbers, Henry Dean, Prior of Llanthony (paymaster at the site) told him to make changes. Brian asked for another £9 to accommodate a change in the plan or &quot;proposition&quot; for the roof involving a round window. Stone for Palace in the 1490s was brought from quarries at Shirburn, Barrington, Taynton, and Windrush. Timber was brought from Bladon, Kirtlington, and Spelsbury. Bricks were made at Oxford and at Brill.

William Este or East maintained the Palace for many years. In the reign of Henry VIII, Sir Edward Chamberlain organised repairs to the newer buildings and to &quot;Rosamund&#x27;s Place&quot;. The roofs at Woodstock were repaired with lead taken from the Priory at Canons Ashby. Edward VI sent a carpenter called Thomas Cropper to survey and draw the buildings.

== Elizabeth I and the gatehouse ==
Elizabeth I, as Princess or &quot;Lady Elizabeth&quot;, was at Woodstock from 20 May 1554 to June 1555. Her keeper was Henry Bedingfeld of Oxburgh. She is said to have been lodged in the upper floors of the gatehouse in 1554, and scratched inscriptions on the palace windows with a diamond ring, and written on a shutter with charcoal. Including the verse:Much suspected by me,&lt;br&gt;Nothing proved can be,&lt;br&gt;Quoth ELIZABETH the prisoner.
Her words were noted by the travellers Paul Hentzner and Henri, Duke of Rohan in 1600. A chamber in the gatehouse had an arched oak ceiling, with carving, painted blue with gilt decoration, and was later known as Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Chamber. According to John Foxe, Elizabeth envied the freedom of milkmaids at Woodstock who she could hear singing in the garden.

Repairs made to the palace in 1576 included the plastering of several rooms. The accounts mention a courtyard with a fountain decorated in an earlier period with heraldic beasts, and a stairway to the great hall also featured four beasts.

==17th century==
King James I and his wife Anne of Denmark, her secretary William Fowler, and Arbella Stuart came to Woodstock in September 1603 during a time of plague. Sir Robert Cecil criticised the building as, &quot;unwholsome, all the house standing upon springs. It is unsavoury, for there is no savour but of cows and pigs. It is uneaseful, for only the King and Queen with the privy chamber ladies and 3 or 4 of Scottish council are lodged in the house&quot;. The court was at Woodstock again in September 1610.

In 1611, King James I gave Woodstock Palace to his son Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, who had a banqueting house built of leafy tree branches in the park, in which he held a dinner for his parents and his sister Princess Elizabeth in August 1612. Henry paid for a poor boy from Woodstock to be apprenticed with Thomas Wilson, a shoemaker on the Strand who worked for the royal family. On 19 February 1617, Woodstock was given to Prince Charles.

In 1649, a survey was made of the manor buildings, mentioning, &quot;a large gatehouse and a courtyard, on the north of which there is range of buildings called the Prince&#x27;s Lodgings, on the east a spacious hall, adjoining to which there is a chapel and lodgings, known by the name of the Bishop&#x27;s Lodgings, another courtyard called the Wardrobe, surrounded with the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s lodgings and wardrobe rooms, adjoining which is the Queen&#x27;s Hall and the steward&#x27;s lodgings. There is a fair staircase leading up to the Guard Chamber, to which joins the Presence Chamber, on the right hand of which is the King&#x27;s withdrawing room, bedchamber and closet, on the right hand the Queen&#x27;s lodgings&quot;. The rooms were then mostly empty of furnishings.

Woodstock Palace was mostly destroyed during the English Civil War.

==Later history==

In 1705, Parliament granted the royal manor and honour (i.e. feudal barony) of Woodstock to John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (1650–1722), in recognition of his victory over the French at the Battle of Blenheim on 13 August 1704. The manor was to be held in feudal tenure from Queen Anne in free socage by service of grand serjeanty &quot;of presenting at Windsor Castle, on the anniversary of the battle, a standard bearing the fleur-de-lys of France&quot;. An inescutcheon &quot;of the Honour and Manor of Woodstock&quot; was further granted by royal warrant in 1722 as an augmentation of honour to his coat of arms and was borne at his funeral. By a further Royal Licence, 26 May 1817, the inescutcheon was added as an augmentation of honour to the arms of the Dukes of Marlborough, and is still borne by them today. The arms comprise a Cross of St George surmounted by the royal arms of France.

Blenheim Palace was built in the manor of Woodstock for the Duke as his new seat. Some stone from the old Palace was used. The ruins of the old palace or manor house of Woodstock were removed in 1723.

<doc id="113549" wikidata="Q27411" url="?curid=113549" title="Scream (1996 film)">
<text>Scream is a 1996 American slasher film directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson. It stars David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, and Drew Barrymore. Set in the fictional town of Woodsboro, California, &quot;Scream&quot;″s plot follows high school student Sidney Prescott (Campbell) and her friends, who, on the anniversary of her mother&#x27;s murder, become the targets of a costumed serial killer known as Ghostface.

Williamson, who was struggling to get his projects off the ground, was inspired by reports of a series of murders by the Gainesville Ripper as he wrote a screenplay that satirized the clichés of the slasher genre popularized in films such as &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978), &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; (1980), and &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; (1984). Developed under the title &quot;Scary Movie&quot;, Williamson&#x27;s script became the subject of an intense bidding war from multiple studios before Miramax Films purchased the rights. Craven, despite turning down the opportunity multiple times, agreed to direct the film after he had read the script as he was determined to re-establish himself after several career setbacks. The involvement of Barrymore and Cox helped secure more support from the studio. Principal photography took place from April to June 1996 in California on a budget of $15million. Craven trimmed down the violence in the film after being involved in a tense conflict with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) over the desired R-rating.

Released on December 20, 1996, &quot;Scream&quot; was not expected to perform well due to concerns over releasing a slasher film in a time normally reserved for holiday entertainment, but it went on to gross approximately $173million worldwide through the strength of word of mouth, becoming a surprise success and one of the highest-grossing films of the year. Reviews praised the performances of its cast and its unique meta humor but criticized its excessive violence and lack of suspense in favor of that humor. The film helped elevate Williamson&#x27;s career as a writer and raised the profiles of the rest of the cast.

&quot;Scream&quot; is now regarded as one of the greatest horror and slasher films ever made. It has been credited with rekindling interest in the horror genre during the 1990s following a decline in the genre&#x27;s popularity. It has remained influential, as Barrymore&#x27;s involvement helped make participating in horror films more acceptable to prominent actors and increased horror films&#x27; appeal with younger audiences. The success of the film launched a multimedia franchise, which comprises the sequels &quot;Scream 2&quot; (1997), &quot;Scream 3&quot; (2000), &quot;Scream 4&quot; (2011), &quot;Scream&quot; (2022), &quot;Scream VI&quot; (2023), and &quot;Scream 7&quot; (2026) as well as an anthology television series.

== Plot ==

In the small town of Woodsboro, California, high school student Casey Becker is home alone when she receives a phone call from an unknown person. They discuss horror films until the caller turns sadistic, threatening her life and revealing that her boyfriend, Steve, is tied up on her patio. The caller demands she answer questions about horror films to save his life, but Casey gives an incorrect answer about &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, resulting in Steve&#x27;s death. Casey attempts to escape, but is stabbed to death by someone wearing a &quot;Ghostface&quot; costume, and her disemboweled corpse is found hanging from a tree by her parents.

The news media descend on the town as a police investigation ensues. Casey&#x27;s classmate, Sidney Prescott, struggles with the impending first anniversary of the rape and murder of her mother Maureen by Cotton Weary. The trauma has made her unable to consummate her relationship with her boyfriend, Billy Loomis. As her father Neil is traveling for work, Sidney waits at home alone for her best friend, Tatum Riley. She receives a call taunting her about Maureen&#x27;s death and is attacked by Ghostface, who disappears just before Billy climbs through her window. Sidney immediately grows suspicious when he drops a cell phone, and Billy is arrested by Deputy Sheriff Dewey Riley, Tatum&#x27;s brother. At the police station, Sidney is confronted by investigative journalist Gale Weathers, who wrote a book claiming that Maureen had multiple extramarital affairs, including one with Cotton, whom Gale believes was falsely accused of Maureen&#x27;s homicide. Sidney stays at Tatum&#x27;s home but receives another taunting call from the killer. The calls are traced to Neil&#x27;s phone, but the police are unable to locate him.

Following his release, Billy encounters Sidney at school and further upsets her by comparing his absent mother to Maureen&#x27;s death. After suspending classes in the wake of the murders, Principal Himbry is murdered in his office. To celebrate the school&#x27;s closure, Stu Macher, Tatum&#x27;s boyfriend, hosts a party at his secluded home. Dewey and Gale keep watch on the party in case the killer strikes again. Tatum is isolated in the garage by Ghostface, who crushes her neck in the garage door. As fellow high schooler Randy Meeks details the rules of surviving a horror film, news arrives of Himbry&#x27;s murder. Most partygoers leave to see his body, nearly running over Dewey and Gale while inadvertently leading them to Neil&#x27;s hidden car. Billy arrives at the house to reconcile with Sidney, and they finally have sex. Afterward, they are attacked by Ghostface, and Billy is stabbed. Sidney evades Ghostface, who kills Gale&#x27;s cameraman Kenny and stabs Dewey when he returns. Gale, attempting to flee in her van, crashes and is knocked unconscious. Sidney seeks refuge inside the house, locking Stu and Randy outside as they accuse each other of being the killer.

A seemingly wounded Billy returns and allows Randy inside before shooting him in the shoulder, revealing himself as the killer and Stu as his accomplice. Billy confesses they killed Maureen because the discovery of her affair with his father led to his mother abandoning him. The pair abducted Neil to frame him for their crimes and proceed to stab each other to depict themselves as the last survivors. However, the killers are distracted by Gale&#x27;s return, allowing Sidney to incapacitate Billy and kill Stu by dropping a television set on his head. Billy nearly stabs Sidney but is shot by Gale. After Randy remarks that horror film killers revive for a final scare, Billy lunges for them, but Sidney shoots him in the head, killing him. As dawn breaks, Neil is rescued, Dewey is taken away by ambulance, and Gale provides an impromptu news report about the night&#x27;s events.

== Production ==
=== Writing ===

In 1994, Kevin Williamson was a novice and financially struggling screenwriter, having recently sold his first script, &quot;Killing Mrs. Tingle&quot; (1999). While house-sitting, Williamson watched a &quot;Turning Point&quot; documentary about serial killer Danny Rolling which he said left him unsettled. Williamson later noticed an open window, armed himself with a knife, and called his friend for support. The pair began discussing horror characters that had resonated with them such as Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees. The following morning, Williamson was woken by a nightmare and used the experience as inspiration for the opening home invasion of &quot;Scream&quot;. He was also influenced by a one-act play he wrote in college about an unknown caller taunting a young girl.

Williamson spent the next three days writing a script for a slasher film he called &quot;Scary Movie&quot; while listening to the score to &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978) for further inspiration. He also drafted two five-page outlines for possible sequels. He developed much of the script around a single line of dialogue, &quot;movies don&#x27;t create psychos, movies make psychos more creative&quot;. This was his response to contemporary concerns about the influence of cinematic violence on audience, and he &quot;thought it was a great line&quot;. Williamson&#x27;s script drew upon many of his favorite horror films, such as &quot;Halloween&quot;, &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, &quot;Prom Night&quot; (both 1980), and &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; (1984). At the time, the successful slasher films of the 1970s and 1980s had fallen out of favor, in part because of increasingly poorly received sequels to long-running horror franchises.

His characters were intentionally designed to be knowledgeable about these horror films and their typical elements, with the intention of creating a unique killer who was not only aware of horror film clichés but also exploited them for his own advantage. Williamson expressed his approach, &quot;I thought if you could expose the rules and play with them, then the audience doesn&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re going to get. Suddenly they&#x27;re on edge. I started playing with the tropes, and the &#x27;rules&#x27; were part of that.&quot; The opening scene depicting Casey Becker&#x27;s death emulates that of Janet Leigh&#x27;s character in &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960) by killing off a possible main character early on. Williamson believed it would hook studio executives and leave audiences unsure how the plot would progress. Williamson set the script in his hometown of Bayboro, North Carolina, believing its quiet atmosphere would provide a strong contrast with a serial killer&#x27;s actions.

Williamson pursued &quot;Scary Movie&quot; because it was the type of horror film he enjoyed as a child but believed were no longer being made. Even so, he did not believe studios would develop and intended to use it to garner attention and secure other work. Williamson&#x27;s agent had him scale back the gore, removing descriptions such as &quot;the insides are slowly rolling down her leg&quot;, because it would make it difficult to sell the script. Williamson refused to cut any dialogue, however, believing it set it apart from similar films.

=== Development ===

By 1995, there was competition to secure the rights to &quot;Scary Movie&quot;, with early interest expressed by Morgan Creek Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures, and filmmaker Oliver Stone. The script came to the attention of producer Cathy Konrad of Woods Entertainment, which had a development deal with production studio Miramax Films. She brought it to Richard Potter, the director of development for Miramax Films&#x27; genre-film-focused subsidiary Dimension Films. Potter expected a &quot;stupid spoof&quot; but was drawn in by the opening scene and recommended Miramax Films chairman, Bob Weinstein, pursue the rights. He agreed, considering it an opportunity to produce films instead of distributing those of others. Although others offered larger figures, Williamson&#x27;s lawyer advised him take Weinstein&#x27;s offer ($400,000–$500,000) because Dimension Films was willing to make the film immediately.

Williamson revised the script based on studio input, removing some gorier content (such as exposed internal organs and severed limbs) and adding the murder of principal Himbry because Weinstein said there was too long a period following the opening without any deaths. This solved a separate difficulty Williamson was having explaining why all but the core group of characters leave Stu&#x27;s party in the finale, as they go to see Himbry&#x27;s corpse. The &quot;Scary Movie&quot; title was also changed to &quot;Scream&quot; late in production because Weinstein was concerned &quot;Scary Movie&quot; would lead audiences to believe it was a comedy instead of a horror.

The search for a director was protracted, with Danny Boyle, Tom McLoughlin, Sam Raimi, George A. Romero, Bryan Singer, Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez, and Anthony Waller being considered. No agreements were secured because those approached for the role interpreted the script as a comedy instead of a horror satire. Wes Craven was discounted by the studio due to his lack of experience directing satires. Craven liked the script but he wanted to work on less gory and more mainstream content (including a film adaptation of the 1959 horror novel &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot;) because of the negative public perception of him based on his previous films. 

Craven&#x27;s assistant Julie Plec and producer Marianne Maddalena continued to push &quot;Scream&quot; to Craven. His interest was renewed after &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot; adaptation was cancelled and he experienced the personal disappointment of his failed horror comedy, &quot;Vampire in Brooklyn&quot; (1995). After reading the script, Plec said Craven suggested the studio make him an offer he can&#x27;t refuse.&#x27; And so Dimension did. And he took it.&quot; The deal also offered Craven his choice of other projects to direct after &quot;Scream&quot;.

Williamson met Craven to discuss the script, believing he would request substantial rewrites, but Craven&#x27;s notes related mainly to typos and some minor additions including restoring some of the gorier content and refining the ending which was not yet fully realized. Williamson said &quot;The story stayed pretty much intact, but we added some scares, and shortened it. Wes reworked some of the action sequences, and we would argue and go back and forth, but there&#x27;s a point where I had to realize that Wes is more experienced than I am.&quot; Describing the script Craven said, &quot;what it forces you to do is sort of look at the reality of things we typically look at as amusing, like the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; type of deaths where people have arrows through their heads and kids scream and laugh. But that suddenly starts happening in their actual lives.&quot;

=== Casting ===

Atypical for the genre at the time, &quot;Scream&quot; featured a cast of established stars, such as Drew Barrymore and Courteney Cox, as well as relatively unknown actors. Executive producer Cary Woods used his friendship with Barrymore&#x27;s agent to cast her in the lead role of Sidney Prescott, but she later requested the smaller role of Casey Becker. Maddalena suggested that Barrymore had wanted to leave the project entirely, but took the smaller role to avoid disappointing Bob Weinstein and his brother Harvey. The filmmakers agreed to the change, believing it would be impactful to kill off their most well-known actor during &quot;Scream&quot;″s opening and convince audiences that no character was safe. Vinessa Shaw and Reese Witherspoon were also considered for Sidney Prescott. Witherspoon was discounted because she looked too young compared to the other cast, and Williamson&#x27;s choice, Molly Ringwald, believed she was too old for the part. The final choices came down to Alicia Witt, Brittany Murphy, and Neve Campbell. According to Williamson, Campbell swiftly emerged as the favored choice among the principal crew and, to improve her chances, they filmed her screen-test first, forcing the other contenders to try and surpass her performance. Beach and Maddalena said Campbell brought athleticism from her dancing background with a combination of strength and vulnerability. Describing what attracted her to the role, Campbell said Sidney was &quot;a fantastic character for any kind of movie&quot; who transitions from &quot;tormented, traumatized, insecure young woman to overwhelmingly empowered and strong&quot;.

Woods suggested Courteney Cox for the cold and calculating Gale Weathers, believing it would be interesting to play against her typical personable characters in series such as &quot;Family Ties&quot; (1982–1989) and &quot;Friends&quot; (1994–2004). Craven did not believe Cox could play the part and so she wrote a letter assuring him that &quot;being &#x27;a bitch&#x27; wouldn&#x27;t be a stretch at all&quot;. Brooke Shields and Janeane Garofalo were considered but a more established actress was preferred. David Arquette auditioned for unspecified younger characters, but he was attracted to the role of Dewey and acting against Cox. The character was written as a &quot;dumb jock&quot; but Arquette interpreted it as a &quot;position of authority getting no respect... He wants to be John Wayne... He wants to be this tough guy, but he&#x27;s just got a heart of gold.&quot; Rose McGowan&#x27;s agent jeopardized her chance to play Tatum by insisting on a payment of $250,000 instead of the offered $50,000, which was lower than the $100,000 received by some other principal actors. As a result, McGowan had to reaudition for the role twice. McGowan influenced Tatum&#x27;s design, dying her hair blonde to avoid having two dark-haired main female characters, removing an Indigo Girls poster from Tatum&#x27;s bedroom (because she would not listen to the relatively older band), and rejecting costuming suggestions in favor of her self-bought outfits. Thora Birch and Natasha Lyonne also auditioned for the role; Lyonne was the preferred choice but, as she was under 18, could not consent to joining without parental permission.

Believing he was rising in popularity, Vince Vaughn was the studio&#x27;s preferred choice for Billy Loomis, but he was too ill to audition. Skeet Ulrich did not attend auditions because of scheduling conflicts but his girlfriend did and mentioned Ulrich brought her; Beach went out to meet him personally. Ulrich liked playing a serial killer after more innocent and naive previous roles. To develop his character, Ulrich researched serial murders, psychological profiles, and outfitted one of his hotel rooms to the Billy persona to help him get into character, outfitting it with punk rock posters and blacklights. He said, &quot;I was into punk music in my teens and really just trying to recapture that angst... I would sit in there and read about serial killers and watch &quot;Faces of Death&quot; (1978)... anything to get into that gory mindset.&quot; Ulrich and Campbell starred together in &quot;The Craft&quot; (1996), which they believed fostered a natural relationship between their characters. Matthew Lillard auditioned for Billy, but the casting directors did not consider him the right actor to &quot;make out with [Campbell]&quot; and had him audition as Stu for Craven, who immediately offered him the part.

Seth Green, Jason Lee, and Breckin Meyer were all preferred for Randy, the &quot;lanky, gangly, opinionated fifth wheel, who really has a love and passion for movies&quot;, but Craven and Williamson appreciated the innocence and comedy that Jamie Kennedy brought to his portrayal. Kennedy credited Craven for supporting his casting. W. Earl Brown and Craven were friends and he was not required to audition but did have to gain about ; he originally wanted to portray Dewey. Roger L. Jackson was hired based on his voice work for &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; (1996). He recounted overhearing his competitors discussing the Ghostface as the &quot;new Freddy Krueger&quot;, but Jackson interpreted it as a more subtle role which required charisma and sexiness to keep his target on the phone even though they want to hang up. Barrymore wanted someone to act against in her scene instead of the character&#x27;s lines being read to her, and while the filmmakers intended to dub over Jackson&#x27;s voice with Tom Kane, Craven liked his performance. Henry Winkler shared an agent with Craven and made his cameo appearance as a favor. Lynn McCree, Sidney&#x27;s mother, was a Sonoma local; she spent two hours taking pictures with Campbell for the role but had no knowledge of the character&#x27;s backstory. Liev Schreiber took the part of Cotton Weary for $20,000 during an unrelated meeting with Bob Weinstein. Extras were drawn from locals including the owners of a restaurant frequented by the cast and crew.

===Pre-production===
It was determined early on that &quot;Scream&quot; required too many different interior and exterior locations to be filmed on sets. Production designer Bruce Miller explained that it was important to portray the characters as vulnerable in their homes which made it essential that they could film inside and outside the properties. Scouts researched locations in the United States and Canada but struggled to locate a house for the opening scene which featured plentiful windows and visibility. Craven initially researched Wilmington, North Carolina but it failed to meet his expectations: &quot;I wanted to have very American looking houses... and a lot of the houses there were very dark brown, or brick, and that didn&#x27;t look attractive to me.&quot; Locations near Vancouver were discounted for similar reasons, as was Napa County, California.

Santa Rosa in Sonoma County, California offered most features the filmmakers required, but the Weinsteins rejected the additional $1 to 2million required to film there until the filmmakers convinced them that Craven&#x27;s name would attract enough audiences to compensate for the added cost. The opening scene used a house in Glen Ellen. Production designer Bruce Miller said, &quot;We didn&#x27;t want homes that looked like castles, or that you could really protect yourself in... so if somebody was going to be stalking them, they could get to them very quickly.&quot; Other Santa Rosa locations used in &quot;Scream&quot; include Sidney&#x27;s House at 1820 Calistoga Road, interiors of Tatum&#x27;s house at 824 McDonald Avenue, and the Bradley Video store, where Randy works. The Healdsburg, California town square appears as the location of the Woodsboro Town Square, the fountain, and the exterior of the town police station.

Stu&#x27;s home was an unoccupied property in Tomales which offered a dark and isolated atmosphere for the finale. Cinematographer Mark Irwin unsuccessfully argued against using the property because it was on top of a hill, introducing logistical challenges for accessing trailers and equipment. Production designer Bruce Alan Miller built a facade of barns in front of the house so trailers could be sited closer while remaining concealed. The art department extensively modified the house, adding Gothic elements such as beams and stained-glass windows to give it a haunted feel, painting the walls red (although they realized later this made the blood stand out less), and adding a white picket fence. The farmhouse-style home offered a &quot;convoluted&quot; layout for a convincing setting where the murders could occur without the other characters realizing. The production crew also added a volleyball net to make it appear as if a teenager lived there.

Santa Rosa High School was selected to portray Woodsboro High School due to its gothic and castle-like imposing visuals. Ten days of filming were to take place there in early June at a cost of $30,000 to 50,000, but permission was revoked in March 1996 by the Santa Rosa school district. The change was ostensibly because of the disruption filming would cause during school hours and scheduled exams, but several school board members objected to the violent content in the script, and hundreds of locals attended a council meeting to debate against and for the production; the board ultimately voted against allowing filming. 

The Sonoma Community Center served as a replacement filming location, but scenes had to be rewritten to accommodate the new location and additional costs to transform the former elementary school into one appropriate for young adults, including larger desks and installing lockers. Craven estimated the disruption and location changes caused by the Santa Rosa district&#x27;s decision cost the production $350,000, including the $27,000 the center was paid for three days of filming. The disruption to filming by the school was not forgotten, with the film&#x27;s credits stating &quot;No thanks whatsoever to the Santa Rosa city school district governing board.&quot;

William&#x27;s script had not described the killer&#x27;s appearance beyond wearing a &quot;ghostly white mask&quot;. Special effects company KNB EFX Group was commissioned to design a mask, but the filmmakers disliked their &quot;gargoyle-ish&quot;, witch, and goblin-like masks designs. While location scouting a house, Maddalena came across what would become the Ghostface mask. This mask, featuring a white shroud, was designed by Brigitte Sleiertin as &quot;The Peanut-Eyed Ghost&quot; for the novelty company Fun World in 1991. However, Craven and the studio wanted to own the design used in the film and tasked KNB EFX with creating a similar but legally distinct design, stretching the nose and chin. Unhappy with the results, Craven eventually decided to pursue the original Fun World design. The killer&#x27;s outfit was completed with a black shroud to avoid their clothing or movements hinting at their identity.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography began on April 15, 1996, on a $14million budget. The first week was spent filming the Casey Becker scenes. To elicit the necessary emotions, Barrymore recalled a sad story developed with Craven and made herself hyperventilate. To enhance her performance, Jackson was situated outside the house so that he could see Barrymore while making the calls but she could not see him. Jackson was used similarly for other Ghostface call scenes, and never met the cast in person. He said &quot;the scariest monsters are the monsters you don&#x27;t see, but the monsters you make in your mind. So just having the voice to react to made it larger in their minds&quot;. 

For safety, stunt performers portrayed the killer in costume, although Craven portrays the killer in parts of the opening. The first few days of filming used a custom mask designed for &quot;Scream&quot;, but Craven did not like it and reshot various scenes with the Fun World design before it was licensed. Because the hung Casey was to appear gutted from chest to waist, effects artist Howard Berger decided against applying prosthetics to Barrymore in favor of a mannequin that could be hollowed out, showing her spine holding her upper and lower parts together. The effect was enhanced with various rubber and vinyl guts. For Steve Orth&#x27;s death, KNB created an open back chair allowing the actor to kneel behind a hollowed out anatomical mannequin torso cut open at the abdomen and filled with latex, rubber, and gelatin intestines.

After viewing the dailies raw footage, the Weinsteins criticized the quality of Craven&#x27;s work as &quot;workmanlike at best&quot;, believing it lacked tension and had an inconsistent tone. The Weinsteins were critical of the Fun World Mask, believing it was &quot;flat&quot; and not scary, suggesting various alternatives, and said Barrymore lacked sex appeal because of the pageboy hairstyle she had chosen. Williamson recounted Craven receiving a call from the brothers and seeing &quot;his back slump. He just started sliding down the chair.&quot; The studio considered abandoning filming or firing Craven, and sent him footage from other films, such as &quot;Nightwatch&quot; (1997), to demonstrate what they wanted for &quot;Scream&quot;.

Konrad defended Craven to the brothers, and in response Bob Weinstein sent Dimension executives Cary Granat and Andrew Rona to the set to directly intervene. Craven, Konrad, Maddalena, and line producer Stuart M. Besser met with Granat, who wanted the opening reshot with each of the Weinstein&#x27;s alternative mask suggestions. Instead, they offered to edit together the existing footage to prove the scene and mask worked and if it did not, then the project would be cancelled. Editor Patrick Lussier worked with Craven to piece together most of the opening, adding temporary music and sound effects. The Weinsteins barred Craven and the producers from attending screening of the footage. Afterward, Bob Weinstein told the filmmakers, &quot;What do I know about dailies? Keep going&quot;, and provided additional financing as well as licensing Fun World&#x27;s design. The producers suggested Weinstein had an &quot;ulterior motive&quot; to force the filmmakers to complete the footage – the upcoming Milan Film Festival, as edited footage was not typically allowed to be screened until eight weeks after filming concluded.

The next main scene filmed was of the central cast sitting around a fountain. Ulrich admitted he did not realize &quot;Scream&quot; was intended to be a horror with comedic elements and was confused by Lillard&#x27;s and Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;humorous moments&quot;, believing they were &quot;ruining the movie... Like, &#x27;This isn&#x27;t funny. This isn&#x27;t supposed to be funny.&#x27; And man, was I wrong.&quot; Craven encouraged improvisation throughout filming, much of it coming from Arquette and Lillard, with Williamson acknowledging that Lillard&#x27;s ad-libs improved the script.

===The finale===

The film&#x27;s 42-minute end sequence set at Stu&#x27;s party was filmed at night over three weeks. Issues filming at the location, including difficulties with providing proper lighting because of the uneven landscape, exacerbated tensions between Craven and Irwin regarding the quality of Irwin&#x27;s footage. &quot;Scream&quot; was filmed with an anamorphic lens, which distorts and stretches the image to achieve a specific aspect ratio. However, neither Craven nor Irwin had much experience with this type of lens. The crew, including Lussier, had raised concerns about lens flares and out-of-focus images, partially blaming the focus puller hired by Irwin. Lussier explained, &quot;You can often tell your focus is supposed to be on somebody&#x27;s eye usually, ... and the focus puller just hasn&#x27;t moved with the actor&quot;. As a result, there were limited options during the editing process due to the inconsistent focus. Irwin said he was informed that all filmed footage was unusable and that 35 days of scenes needed to be reshot. After an argument with Maddalena, Irwin was immediately fired and replaced by Peter Deming for the final three weeks of filming. Irwin believed he was made a scapegoat for the film&#x27;s behind-schedule status, risking Craven forfeiting his salary, but Konrad denied this.

Kennedy&#x27;s horror rules scene was initially performed in a single take, but he requested additional takes, feeling he could enhance the performance (Craven ultimately chose the third take). During Tatum&#x27;s death scene, McGowan had trouble staying in the pet door as the garage door rose. To address this, the crew nailed her shirt to the frame to hold her in place. Craven found it challenging managing the scene&#x27;s tone, aiming to avoid trivializing Tatum&#x27;s death while paying homage to other horror films. McGowan improvised the screams for her mother to give the character more humanity. When Gale drives a van with Kenny&#x27;s corpse on top, Brown was on top of the van, but the unprepared stunt driver accelerated at full speed. When he hit the brakes, Brown fell off the side of the van and the stunt coordinator grabbed Brown&#x27;s pants and ankle, saving him from harm.

Five nights were spent on the kitchen confrontation between Billy, Stu, and Sidney. By the time they had filmed Gale returning with a gun, Ulrich said he and Lillard were &quot;roaming around like caged animals&quot; to keep the intensity of their performances high, to the point Craven asked them to relax because they were scaring Cox. Lillard described maintaining that level of adrenaline as exhausting. Campbell, Kennedy, Lillard, and Ulrich endured multiple nights covered in fake blood, and the costumes could not be washed to maintain continuity (they were dampened each night to make the blood appear fresh). When Ulrich stabs a sofa, the filmmakers were unaware it was stuffed with feathers which stuck to the fake blood; Maddalena considered Craven &quot;nuts&quot; for keeping the feathers in the scene. Lillard improvised lines such as &quot;My mom&#x27;s gonna be so mad at me&quot; and &quot;You fucking hit me with the phone, you dick&quot;, the latter taking place when Ulrich threw a phone near him as intended but the sticky blood caused it to veer off and inadvertently hit Lillard. Ulrich suggested Billy cracking his neck before shooting Gale, and the sound was added in post-production. Campbell&#x27;s stuntwoman accidentally stabbed Ulrich with an umbrella tip, missing the protective vest he was wearing and hitting the site of an open heart surgery Ulrich had as a child.

Filming concluded on June 14, 1996. The cast spoke fondly of the &quot;summer camp&quot; atmosphere during filming and the camaraderie they formed. The main cast and select crew members, including Craven, often gathered together in the early mornings after filming for meals, activities, and socializing. Arquette&#x27;s hotel room was transformed into a makeshift club where they would congregate. However, due to complaints from other residents, they eventually relocated their early morning gatherings to a nearby barn.

=== Post-production ===
The &quot;Scary Movie&quot; title remained late into production, appearing on the cast and crew gifts for completing filming. Harvey Weinstein suggested &quot;Scream&quot; based on the Michael and Janet Jackson song &quot;Scream&quot;. Many of the cast and crew were initially unhappy with the change. Sony Pictures filed a lawsuit against Dimension and Miramax, claiming &quot;Scream&quot; infringed on their copyright of &quot;Screamers&quot; (1995). The case was settled out of court with Dimension being able to use &quot;Scream&quot; going forward. Although Arquette&#x27;s and Kennedy&#x27;s characters were killed in the script, alternate scenes were filmed showing them survive in case they proved popular with test screening audiences. The successful screenings also resulted in Miramax asking Craven to direct two &quot;Scream&quot; sequels.

&quot;Scream&quot; was rated NC-17 by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), restricting its audience to those over 17 years of age, which was considered &quot;box-office suicide&quot; by industry experts. The MPAA told Craven that &quot;Scream&quot; would never receive a more commercial R-rating, allowing younger people to see the film when accompanied by an adult. Craven said, &quot;I&#x27;m a director who can do something very well but am not allowed to put it on screen. And they ultimately get you, as they did on this one, on intensity. They say, &#x27;it&#x27;s not a specific shot, it&#x27;s not blood, it&#x27;s just too intense. The filmmakers eventually convinced the MPAA that &quot;Scream&quot; was a spoof, believing they were too focused on the horror aspects. It took up to nine cuts to address the MPAA&#x27;s complaints, including removing any movement of Steve Orth&#x27;s internal organs, trimming Kenny&#x27;s throat being slit (because the actor&#x27;s pained expression was too &quot;disturbing&quot;), moving Billy and Stu stabbing each other off screen, and reducing scenes of Casey&#x27;s hanging body and Tatum&#x27;s crushed head. The slow motion stabbing of Casey was considered &quot;too brutal&quot; but was allowed with only a few frames removed because there was no alternate footage to use. The final cut runs for 111minutes.

=== Music ===
Despite having no background in film scoring or an interest in the horror genre, Marco Beltrami was recommended to Plec and Craven, who found his music samples original compared with Beltrami&#x27;s contemporaries. Craven gave Beltrami a weekend to compose &quot;The Cue from Hell&quot;, the score for the film&#x27;s opening sequence, which secured his hiring. Beltrami wrote the piece from Casey&#x27;s perspective and used an &quot;operatic&quot; style, employing a range of instruments, including piano and brass. Beltrami described himself as &quot;bumbling&quot; through the scoring process, acknowledging his limited knowledge of horror music styles. He incorporated elements of the western genre, particularly for Dewey&#x27;s theme, and took cues from composers including Elliot Goldenthal, Ennio Morricone, Eric Serra, Christopher Young, and Hans Zimmer.

Due to budget constraints, Beltrami had to work with a small orchestra of fewer than 50 performers. To compensate for the lack of string harmonics, he instructed the string players to whistle, and asked Craven, Lussier, Maddalena, and Woods to join and boost their numbers. Beltrami identified most with Sidney&#x27;s character and considered her theme&quot;Sidney&#x27;s Lament&quot;to be one of the score&#x27;s crucial pieces. He chose not to assign a distinctive motif to Ghostface, to avoid hinting at the killer&#x27;s identity. Licensed music for &quot;Scream&quot; was provided by TVT Records and includes covers of &quot;(Don&#x27;t Fear) The Reaper&quot; by Gus Black and &quot;Birds Fly (Whisper to a Scream)&quot; by Soho, &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot; by Alice Cooper, &quot;First Cool Hive&quot; by Moby, and &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot; by Republica. Excepts from the &quot;Halloween&quot; score are also present.

== Release ==
===Context===

The theatrical year of 1996 was projected to record a $5.8billion domestic box office record after twelve films grossed over $100million, with &quot;Independence Day&quot; and &quot;Twister&quot; each earning over $200million. However, individual successes were hindered by the high number of releases competing for audiences, resulting in several box office flops and studio bankruptcies. This was compounded by rising production costs and high salaries for stars such as Jim Carrey, Tom Cruise, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Julia Roberts, prompting many studios to cut their film slate by fifty percent. Even so, over forty films were scheduled for release in late 1996, including &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do America&quot;, &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot;, &quot;Ransom&quot;, &quot;Space Jam&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;.

Bob Weinstein opted to release &quot;Scream&quot; in December as counterprogramming, offering teenagers an alternative to more traditional holiday fare. The decision was unpopular with the cast and crew, with Williamson expecting the film to fail. Weinstein explained, &quot;people said we were crazy to put out &quot;Scream&quot; over Christmas... It was a thriller; it didn&#x27;t have big stars; it couldn&#x27;t compete. Well, after &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, where is that audience going to go?&quot; 

The marketing for &quot;Scream&quot; positioned Barrymore as the lead character to intentionally shock the audience with her death. During a promotional interview, Ulrich inadvertently revealed he portrayed one of the killers and called his agent to get the story blocked.

=== Box office ===
The premiere of &quot;Scream&quot; took place on December 18, 1996, at the AVCO theater in Westwood, Los Angeles. It was released in the United States and Canada on December 20. During its opening weekend, the film grossed $6.4million across 1,413 theaters—an average of $4,497 per theater—making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of the weekend, behind &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; ($7million), &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; ($13.1million), and the debut of &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do America&quot; ($20.1million). The performance was considered a failure by industry professionals, resulting in &quot;Variety&quot; labeling &quot;Scream&quot; &quot;dead on arrival&quot;. Maddalena recounted herself and Craven observing a raucous audience for &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do America&quot; while &quot;Scream&quot; had &quot;maybe seven people in there. No one was laughing or screaming. We went away so dejected.&quot; However, &quot;Scream&quot; received positive audience word-of-mouth and exit-polling responses, leading the studio to increase the marketing and distribution budget. This contributed to &quot;Scream&quot;″s performance improving in the following weeks. Although it fell to fifth place in its second weekend, it increased its weekend gross to $9.1million, and again in its third weekend, rising to third place with $10million. &quot;Scream&quot; remained in the top-ten-highest-grossing films for nine weeks in total, becoming a surprise success and grossing a total of $103million. This figure made it the number13 highest-grossing film of 1996, and highest-grossing slasher film of its time, until &quot;Halloween&quot; (2018). It was Miramax&#x27;s second film to gross $100million in the United States and Canada after &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994). The film was most successful with teenagers and young people in their 20s.

Outside of the U.S. and Canada, &quot;Scream&quot; is estimated to have grossed a further $70million, including $14million in the United Kingdom, making it the number21 highest-grossing film. This gives &quot;Scream&quot; a cumulative worldwide total of $173million, making it the number15 highest-grossing film of the year. After four weeks of release, it became the highest-grossing horror film in France, with a gross of $6.2million (37.9million French Francs). In Japan, the release date was postponed from May 1997 to August after the murder of a 14-year-old boy, whose killer was apparently obsessed with horror movies.

Industry analysis showed that most of the films released toward the end of the year were box office failures, including both big-budget fare and a surge of films targeted toward women. Only a few were seen as successes, including &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot;, &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do America&quot;, &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, &quot;Ransom&quot;, &quot;Scream&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;. The success of &quot;Scream&quot; resulted in additional financial compensation for the principal crew and cast, triggered by the box office surpassing $40million and subsequent increments of $10million up to $100million. Kennedy noted that his first residual check was double his salary.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===

&quot;Scream&quot; received generally positive reviews. Critics, such as Roger Ebert, James Berardinelli, and Owen Gleiberman, praised &quot;Scream&quot;″s meta commentary about its horror predecessors and its self-referential humor while also writing that the self parody diluted any suspense, and criticizing the excessive violence. Some critics said that the film&#x27;s intelligence and wit beneath the gore would be appreciated by &quot;sophisticated viewers&quot;, but Ebert was unsure if the degree of violence was &quot;defused by the ironic way the film uses it and comments on it&quot;.

Janet Maslin wrote that while &quot;Scream&quot; offered original ideas for the genre, it quickly exhausted them. John Hartl offered a similar sentiment, believing &quot;Scream&quot; was so focused on referencing other films that it did not know when to &quot;settle down to tell a coherent story&quot;. Bill Stamets considered these references insightful, particularly the killers&#x27; motives, saying &quot;Killers without motives are far more scary.&quot;

Critics such as Berardinelli, Thomas, and Leonard Klady wrote positively of the ensemble cast and their instrumentality in the film&#x27;s success. Peter Stack and Dave Kehr praised Campbell for her standout performance that successfully carried the central focus on her character, portraying a tough, capable heroine who avoids the &quot;damsel in distress&quot; archetype. While some reviewers appreciated Cox for delivering a strong performance in an against-type role, others criticized her for being unconvincing as a tough and career-obsessed reporter. Thomas and John Hartl wrote that Arquette delivered a &quot;goofily charming&quot; performance. Lisa Alspector described Ulrich as the only cast member capable of balancing genuine characterization with self-parody.

The film&#x27;s opening sequence received praise for building tension and suspense. Gleiberman and Richard Harrington appreciated the absence of gratuitous nudity in the scene, which was atypical for the genre. Kevin Thomas credited Irwin&#x27;s &quot;resourcefulness&quot; and Lussier&#x27;s &quot;razor-sharp&quot; editing as key to &quot;Scream&quot;″s success.

=== Accolades ===
At the 23rd Saturn Awards in 1997, &quot;Scream&quot; won awards for Best Actress (Campbell), Best Writing (Williamson), and Best Horror Film. The film was named Best Movie at the MTV Movie Awards, and Campbell was nominated for Best Female Performance. &quot;Scream&quot; was named Best Film by the International Horror Guild. Craven also received the Grand Prize at the Gérardmer Film Festival.

==Post-release==

=== Home media ===
The soundtrack of &quot;Scream&quot; was released in December 1996 by TVT Records as &quot;Scream: Music From The Dimension Motion Picture&quot;; it sold poorly. &quot;Scream&quot; was released on VHS and Laserdisc in June 1997, and was especially successful in the video rental market, becoming the second most rented movie of 1997 in the United States. In 2000, &quot;Scream&quot; was released as part of &quot;The Ultimate &quot;Scream&quot; Collection&quot;, alongside its then-two sequels, &quot;Scream 2&quot; (1997) and &quot;Scream 3&quot; (2000). The release introduced special features including cast screen tests, outtakes, and a documentary about the making of the three films featuring interviews with Craven, Williamson, Campbell, Cox, and Arquette. A director&#x27;s cut release of &quot;Scream&quot; restored uncut sequences removed for the theatrical release.

The film was released on Blu-ray in 2011, including previously released special features. For the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary in 2021, &quot;Scream&quot; was remastered and released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray in a steelbook case. Alongside the previously released special features, the remastered version included &quot;A Bloody Legacy: &quot;Scream&quot; 25 Years Later&quot;, a documentary featuring new interviews with the cast and crew. In 2022, Varèse Sarabande released the score in a limited-edition six-disc box CD set and digitally, alongside Beltrami&#x27;s work on other installments, as well as unreleased music, demos, and alternate versions. A four-LP record set was released separately in a jacket that turns into a Ghostface mask.

===Other media===
A 2011 documentary, &quot;Still Screaming: The Ultimate Scary Movie Retrospective&quot;, documents the production of the original trilogy of &quot;Scream&quot; films, and includes interviews with cast and crew from throughout the series. A book, &quot;It All Began With A Scream&quot; by Padraic Maroney, was also released that year, offering a similar look at the production of &quot;Scream&quot; and its three immediate sequels.

The popularity of the Ghostface character generated a variety of merchandise, and the killer&#x27;s outfit remained a popular Halloween costume .

==Thematic analysis==
===Themes===
&quot;Scream&quot; is influenced by, and pays many homages to, the history of the horror genre, including a school janitor referencing Freddy Krueger, a cameo appearance by Linda Blair, famed for her appearance in &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973), and the killers admonishing the police for not watching &quot;Prom Night&quot; for advice. In a meta reference, Randy recounts the rules of the genre: to survive a horror film, characters cannot sin by drinking, taking drugs, or having sex, and they cannot say &quot;&#x27;I&#x27;ll be right back.&#x27; Because you won&#x27;t be back&quot;. This self reference is extended when Randy (Jamie Kennedy), watches &quot;Halloween&quot; and yells at the lead character Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) to look behind her, oblivious to the killer approaching himself from behind. Further, Kenny futilely yells at Randy to look behind him while observing via a remote camera. When Sidney confronts Billy and Stu, she says &quot;You&#x27;ve seen one too many movies&quot;, to which Billy replies &quot;Movies don&#x27;t create psychos, movies make psychos more creative.&quot; Writer Kate Gardener believed this dialogue rejects the blame on horror films for inspiring real-world violence. Lussier said the MPAA had objected to this dialogue because &quot;you can&#x27;t speak that kind of truth&quot;.

Writers Adam White and Michelle Delgado wrote that &quot;Scream&quot; is an exploration of the &quot;exploitative&quot; nature of the news media using traumatic events as entertainment. The debut of &quot;Scream&quot; coincided with growing discourse in the United States on the impact of on-screen violence and its potential consequences for society. During this time, the Clinton administration introduced the V-chip, a device designed to enable parents to block mature television content. However, news programs remained exempt from the ratings system, which Delgado said continued to &quot;exploit&quot; violent incidents to captivate audiences. Gale portrays a relentless television reporter who used Maureen&#x27;s murder to further her own career and seeks to do the same with the Woodsboro murders. Although Gale advocates for the innocence of Cotton Weary in Maureen&#x27;s death, she does so both because she believes he is innocent and to secure a lucrative book deal. While Gale&#x27;s actions revolve around profiting from the suffering of others, she is depicted not as a villain but a careerist and an antagonist to Sidney who evolves into a heroic figure, aiding in the deaths of Billy and Stu. Gardener wrote that making a living from murder is not morally equal to committing murder, but that it represents the commodification of crime and female trauma. &quot;Scream&quot; acknowledges the audience&#x27;s voyeuristic interest in murder and horror, underscoring the monetary value placed on sensationalized crimes.

White described Williamson&#x27;s script as emblematic of its time, featuring a &quot;picture-perfect&quot; mother raped and murdered in American suburbia and the stalking of her daughter one year later. He compared it to contemporary sensationalized cases such as the Murder trial of O. J. Simpson, Lorena Bobbit&#x27;s assault of her husband, the Long Island Lolita case, and the Gainesville Ripper. The Ripper&#x27;s defence included his assertion of being influenced by films such as &quot;The Exorcist III&quot; (1990). Despite public concerns about the influence of violent media, instances of violent crime were decreasing when &quot;Scream&quot; was released and there remained no direct link between violent media content and real-life crimes. Even so, public fascination with these media portrayals created a form of celebrity for the victims or perpetrators, with dramatic events being turned into documentaries and films. In &quot;Scream&quot;, Sidney jokes that a film will be made about the traumatic events of her life and, in the sequels, the film-within-a-film &quot;Stab&quot; horror series is created, based partly on the events of each preceding &quot;Scream&quot; entry.

===Analysis===
Author Padraic Maroney wrote that &quot;Scream&quot; was pro-feminism, depicting several final girls who fight the killer instead of submitting. The success of &quot;Scream&quot; demonstrated to studios that although typically seen as fare for young males, horror films had an untapped female market. Writer Aime Simon said Sidney, like Craven&#x27;s Nancy Thompson, is allowed to develop as a character by surviving successive films. The &quot;Scream&quot; films often explore female trauma through characters such as Sidney and Gale, including the dangers posed by angry males who feel rejected. Gardener said that although this may not have been Craven&#x27;s intention, the film&#x27;s narrative effectively conveys this theme. She continued that the male killers in &quot;Scream&quot; enact violence and intimidation primarily on women, including Casey who romantically rejects Stu before the events of the film, and Sidney&#x27;s mother Maureen, as Billy blames her for the end of his parents&#x27; marriage. Maureen is not responsible for his mother leaving, but Billy blames her, takes his anger out on her directly, and then abuses Sidney&#x27;s emotional vulnerability caused by her death. In this way, the portrayal of Billy and Stu as angry entitled men seeking revenge is more relatable and realistic than supernatural horror villains.

&quot;Scream&quot; has been analyzed for homosexual or queer undertones, influenced by Williamson&#x27;s own experiences as a gay man. He has expressed how his personal struggles informed Sidney&#x27;s character because he identified parallels between her survival tactics and those of young gay individuals. In a 2021 interview, he said &quot;as a gay kid, I related to the final girl and to her struggle because it&#x27;s what one has to do to survive as a young gay kid, too. Subconsciously, I think the &quot;Scream&quot; movies are coded in gay survival.&quot; Several publications have highlighted the positive response from gay fans of the franchise to these underlying themes.

Some writers, such as Maroney, Brant Lewis, and Joe Lipsett, have discussed the theory that Billy and Stu are in a homosexual relationship or that Stu held unrequited feelings for Billy. Professor David Greven wrote that Billy and Stu are representative of the changing notions of masculinity and the underlying currents of queer desire in 90s films. The interactions between them throughout the movie contain themes of homoeroticism, such as when Stu playfully touches Randy&#x27;s earlobe or leans on Billy during the climax before they stab each other with phallic weapons. Greven believed that although it is easy to assign homosexuality to Stu because of his lack of motive to kill and apparent willingness to please his friend, Billy also features homoerotic characteristics such as the gay trope of fixating on his maternal relationship, similar to Norman Bates in &quot;Psycho&quot;, and Billy&#x27;s visual styling resembling actor James Dean, considered a queer icon. Williamson loosely based the characters on Leopold and Loeb, queer individuals who committed murder to prove their intellectual superiority. In a 2022 interview he said he was &quot;very hesitant to present the gay side of me in [&quot;Scream&quot;]&quot; and that any queerness in Billy&#x27;s and Stu&#x27;s characters was &quot;a little coded and maybe accidental&quot;.

== Legacy ==
===Cultural influence===
In the decades following its release, &quot;Scream&quot; has remained an enduringly popular horror film and launched a successful film franchise. It is credited with revitalizing the horror genre, which had significantly declined in popularity by the early 1990s. &quot;Far Out&quot; and MTV described &quot;Scream&quot; as a &quot;ground-breaking&quot; slasher film that &quot;successfully crossed over into the mainstream&quot; because of its deft blend of traditional horror with self-aware commentary and satire. &quot;Vox&quot; wrote that &quot;Scream&quot; &quot;mainstreamed metatextual storytelling and made that analytical understanding of the genre mainstream in a lot of ways&quot;. Studios rushed to capitalize on &quot;Scream&quot;″s success with teen-centric horror films and television series leading into the 2000s, such as &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; (1997), &quot;Urban Legend&quot; (1998) and &quot;Cherry Falls&quot; (2000), as well as sequels to popular, but diminished, franchises such as &quot;Halloween H20: 20 Years Later&quot; and &quot;Bride of Chucky&quot; (both 1998). &quot;Scream&quot; also serves as the subject of the parody film &quot;Scary Movie&quot; (2000), which in turn launched its own franchise of horror spoofs. Director Jordan Peele has credited &quot;Scream&quot; as a direct inspiration for his own influential horror film, &quot;Get Out&quot; (2017), in manipulating the audience&#x27;s expectations of the modern horror genre.

&quot;Scream&quot; helped launch or bolster the careers of its principal stars, including Campbell, Ulrich, Lillard, McGowan, Kennedy, and Arquette. Williamson became an in-demand screenwriter, contributing to horror films such as &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; (1997) and television series &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; (1998–2003). &quot;Scream&quot; helped revitalize Craven&#x27;s career after several career setbacks and a string of poor performances. Lussier credited his work on &quot;Scream&quot;″s opening with his transition to director, beginning with &quot;Dracula 2000&quot; (2000). Barrymore&#x27;s involvement helped raised the profile of the horror genre, making it a more attractive prospect for prominent actors instead of relative unknowns. In a 2021 interview, Kennedy said he was still approached by fans about his horror rules monologue. Lillard described &quot;Scream&quot; as a &quot;seminal&quot; moment of his career. He and Campbell began a two-year relationship during filming, while Cox and Arquette married and eventually divorced.

&quot;Scream&quot; has often been referenced in popular culture in and outside the horror genre. The Ghostface killer is considered to be among the most iconic cinematic horror villains. Ghostface (voiced by Jackson) is a playable character in the fighting game &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; (2023). As of 2021, Lillard&#x27;s improvised dialogue, &quot;My mom and dad are gonna be so mad at me&quot;, was still quoted to him by fans.

In the years since its release, &quot;Scream&quot; was cited as an influence in several violent crimes and murders, with perpetrators sometimes dressing as Ghostface, as in the 2006 murder of Cassie Jo Stoddart. Following the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, an increasing media and public scrutiny on the influence of violent films, games, and other media on society the United States Senate Commerce committee reviewed the marketing of films to youths, specifically the horror genre. &quot;Scream&quot;″s opening was shown as an example of negative media which may be viewed by children. The use of Caller ID to identify incoming callers also increased by 300% following &quot;Scream&quot;″s release.

===Retrospective assessments===

&quot;Scream&quot; is regarded as a classic of the horror genre, and among the greatest horror and slasher films ever made. Several publications have also listed it among the best films of the 1990s. Williamson believed &quot;Scream&quot;″s success was due, in part, to fitting the contemporary zeitgeist when &quot;everyone wanted to have scary and fun in their life... If the movie had been released at any other time, I&#x27;m not sure that would&#x27;ve been the case&quot;. Campbell believed it connected with audiences because of a deft combination of humor, horror, and intelligence. , &quot;Scream&quot; remains the highest-grossing film in the &quot;Scream&quot; film series, and is generally considered to be the best film in the series. The franchise is also among the highest-grossing horror franchises, alongside &quot;Halloween&quot;, &quot;Saw&quot;, and &quot;The Conjuring&quot; Universe.

In 2008, &quot;Empire&quot; ranked the film number482 on its list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed &quot;Scream&quot; as one of the Best High School movies and among the best films of the preceding 13 years. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of from the aggregated reviews of critics, with an average score of . The consensus reads: &quot;Horror icon Wes Craven&#x27;s subversive deconstruction of the genre is sly, witty, and surprisingly effective as a slasher film itself, even if it&#x27;s a little too cheeky for some&quot;. The film has a score of 66 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 25 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. The British Film Institute (BFI) called the opening scene &quot;one of the all-time great pre-credit scenes—an unforgettable masterclass of building tension, heart-stopping terror, and shocking images&quot;. The scene appeared at number13 on &quot;Bravo&quot;″s 2004 list of the 100 Scariest Movie Moments.

== Sequels ==

Due to the success of &quot;Scream&quot;, development of a sequel began while the original was still in theaters. &quot;Scream 2&quot; (1997) achieved similar financial and critical success as &quot;Scream&quot;. Williamson was unavailable to write &quot;Scream 3&quot; (2000), the trilogy&#x27;s concluding chapter, and was replaced with Ehren Kruger. The film fared less well than its predecessors, commercially and critically, and is regarded as the franchise&#x27;s most divisive entry. Williamson returned to the series with the reboot film &quot;Scream 4&quot; (2011). While &quot;Scream 4&quot; has grown in esteem since its release, its modest box office and critical reception, as well as Craven&#x27;s death, placed the franchise on hold.

A television adaptation, &quot;Scream&quot; (2015–2019), ran for three seasons. The Weinsteins refused to license the Fun World costume for the show or allow references to the films, which was controversial with fans and contributed to the series&#x27; low ratings, poor reception, and eventual cancellation.

The film series was relaunched with &quot;Scream&quot; (2022), and its success led to immediate development of a sixth installment, &quot;Scream VI&quot; (2023). Both films are directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, and written by James Vanderbilt and Guy Busick. These films focus on a younger cast, including Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega, with Campbell, Cox, and Arquette appearing in supporting legacy roles. &quot;Scream VI&quot; was the first film in the series not to feature Campbell, who declined to return following a dispute over pay, or Arquette. &quot;Scream 7&quot; began filming in January 2025, with Campbell reprising her role and Kevin Williamson directing.

<text>Staveley is a town and civil parish in the Borough of Chesterfield, Derbyshire, England, along the banks of the River Rother (5 miles) northeast of Chesterfield, (5 miles) west of Clowne, (5 miles) northwest of Bolsover, (11 miles) southwest of Worksop and (13 miles) southeast of Sheffield.

==History==
Staveley was formerly a mining town with several large coal mines in and around the area, the closest being Ireland Pit (Ireland Colliery Brass Band is named after the colliery). However, the pit has closed, along with the others in the area.

Staveley Miners Welfare on Market Street was built in 1893 as an indoor market hall by Charles Paxton Markham, for a time owner of Markham &amp; Co. At that time, it was called Markham Hall in memory of his father. Markham played a large role in the industrial development of the area around Staveley. Through his company Markham &amp; Co. and its successor Staveley Coal and Iron Company, Markham owned ironstone quarries, several coal mines (including Markham Colliery), chemical works, ironworks and an engineering works specialising in mining and tunnelling equipment.

Other major local industries in recent history have included Staveley Works foundry and Staveley Chemicals. The nationwide decline in industry has meant that Staveley Chemicals and Staveley Works have now almost entirely closed, with the only section of the chemical plant remaining being the P-aminophenol plant (a key component to making Paracetamol), which is run by American/Irish company Covidien. Notice has been served on the plant, earmarked for closure around June 2012, this closure will mark the end of over 100 yrs. of chemical production at Staveley..

It is also the home town of the Townes Brewery. Modern industry includes a plastic pipe moulding factory for Brett Martin plc. There was also a wood wool production unit on Staveley works.

The New Markham Vale Loop Road has been completed and opens up the former Markham coal field areas to development, linking the town to a new junction (29A) on the M1 motorway, this junction opened in early July 2008. This is part funded by European Union regeneration money. The scheme also reinstates part of the former Chesterfield Canal which crosses the route. There is a long-term project to reinstate the canal from Chesterfield to Kiveton where it currently terminates. Sections from Chesterfield to Brimington were reinstated as part of previous stages of the Chesterfield Bypass and opencast schemes on part of the former Staveley Coal and Iron Company site which was part of British Steel Corporation following Nationalisation. The new Staveley Town Basin was officially opened on 30 June 2012 and forms the centre piece of the imaginative redevelopment of the Chesterfield Canal in Staveley. The basin is designed to provide facilities to enable the economic development of the isolated section in advance of full restoration. It will provide secure short- and long-term moorings, slipway, car parking, cycle racks, toilets and showers as well as a large open play area which can also be used for major waterway events and festivals.

As part of the Markham Vale scheme to regenerate the site of the former Markham Colliery site there was a proposal to build a &quot;Solar Pyramid&quot; to form the world&#x27;s largest functional timepiece. This project has now been cancelled. However, on the site near Poolsbrook Country Park, a caravan site for tourists has now been built boosting numbers to the country park. The area has several trails for walkers and mountain bikers along former pit railway lines.

==Staveley Hall==

Staveley Hall is situated to the northeast of St John The Baptist Church in Staveley, with vehicular access from the Lowgates traffic island. The Hall in its present form was built in 1604 by Sir Peter Frecheville (c.1571-1634), MP. Before the current building there had been buildings on this site for over 700 years. A brief history of the building and its ownership follows:
* Hascuit de Musard was awarded the Manor of Staveley after the Norman Conquest of 1066. 
* In 1306 the Musard family died out and Ralph de Frecheville became the new Lord. 
* The Frechevilles lived in the Hall until they died out in 1682. In 1603 Sir Peter de Frecheville was knighted by James I at Worksop and he wished to make Staveley Hall a suitable residence for a knight and Justice of the Peace.
* The architect of Sir Peter de Frecheville&#x27;s house is not known but may well be Huntingdon Smithson – the architect employed by the Cavendishes at Bolsover Castle. 
* In 1682 and the house was sold to the Cavendish family. James Cavendish died in 1751 and the Hall and Park reverted to the Duke of Devonshire. 
* In 1756 the Rector of Staveley managed to persuade the Duke of Devonshire to allow his son (and then a series of clerics) to live there.
* It remained as a rectory until bought by Staveley Urban District Council in 1967. 
* The Hall was designated by English Heritage as a listed building (grade II) in 1974.
* Upon Local Government reorganisation in 1974 ownership passed to Chesterfield Borough Council and it was eventually bought by Staveley Town Council.

==Transport==
Staveley was formerly served by four railway stations on two separate lines.
*Staveley Central was on the Great Central Main Line and Chesterfield Loop. It opened in 1892 as &quot;Staveley Town&quot; until being renamed as &quot;Staveley Central&quot; in 1950. It closed to passengers in 1964 and to freight in the 1980s. The platforms survived until the 2000s when a road, &quot;Ireland Close&quot;, was built through the site. Nothing remains of the station other than the bridge carrying the road over the former railway.
*Staveley Works was on the former Great Central Main Line and was the next stop north after Staveley Central. The station served the former Staveley Works. It opened in 1892 and closed in 1963. The platforms still survive although the site is now undeveloped land.
*Barrow Hill was on the Doe Lea branch line from Chesterfield to Mansfield Woodhouse and the Old Road line from Chesterfield to Rotherham. The station opened in 1841 as &quot;Staveley&quot;, only to then be renamed as &quot;Barrow Hill and Staveley Works&quot; in 1900 and finally renamed as &quot;Barrow Hill&quot; in 1951. It closed to passengers in 1954 and to all traffic in 1981. The site was cleared after closure and the line between Rotherham and Chesterfield still runs through the site. The Doe Lea Branch closed in the 1990s and the track has since been lifted. There have been proposals to reopen the station to serve the town of Staveley and surrounding areas.
*Staveley Town was on the former Doe Lea and Clowne branch lines which connected the town to nearby towns of Bolsover and Clowne. The station opened in 1888 as &quot;Netherthorpe&quot; with the opening of the Clowne Branch Line. The line to Mansfield Woodhouse was then opened in 1890 and the station was renamed &quot;Netherthorpe for Staveley Town&quot; in 1893. The station was then finally renamed &quot;Staveley Town&quot; in 1900. The Doe Lea Branch closed to passengers in 1930 and the station was served by services on the Clowne Branch only until 1952. The station was demolished and the line was still in use until the 1990s when the branch lines were closed to both Creswell and Bolsover and Mansfield Woodhouse (after 1974). The site is now an unmarked footpath and there have been proposals to reuse this section of the railway for a possible Chesterfield to Rotherham line.
=== Proposed Bypass ===
A road bypass of Staveley and Brimington has been proposed since 1927. When the A61 Rother Way (also known as the Chesterfield Bypass) was constructed in the 1980s, a short dual carriageway spur was constructed over the River Rother and the Canal, terminating at a large roundabout which has an access road to a supermarket and the single carriageway A619 continuing to Brimington. The dual carriageway was planned to continue, heading northwards through Wheeldon Mill Greyhound Stadium (since demolished) before crossing the Canal twice and following the course of the Rother through Staveley Works. There would have likely been a grade separated junction between Mill Green and Hall Lane to serve the town and the nearby village of Barrow Hill. Then the dual carriageway would have curved eastward and run north of Mastin Moor, connecting to Junction 30 of the M1 at Barlborough. The plans caused controversy as the crossing of the Canal would have divided it into five linear ponds, and a petition put a halt to the bypass plans, but not before digging of a cutting had commenced.

In 2009, the A6192 Ireland Close was built, connecting a small roundabout on Hall Lane to several more roundabouts near Poolsbrook, then to Junction 29A.

As part of regeneration proposals for Staveley Works, there is a &#x27;spine road&#x27; proposed to run from the superstore roundabout off Rother Way to Hall Lane. However it is planned to be low speed single carriageway with several roundabouts or signal controlled junctions, which may create even more congestion.

In July 2019, the MP for North East Derbyshire, Lee Rowley, gained support for a proper Staveley Bypass from the government.

<doc id="113553" wikidata="Q383912" url="?curid=113553" title="Glossop">
<text>Glossop is a market town in the borough of High Peak, Derbyshire, England, east of Manchester, north-west of Sheffield and north of Matlock. Near Derbyshire&#x27;s borders with Cheshire, Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire, between above sea level, it is bounded by the Peak District National Park to the south, east and north. In 2021, it had a population of 17,825.

Historically, the name &quot;Glossop&quot; refers to the small hamlet that gave its name to an ancient parish recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 and then the manor given by William I of England to William Peverel. A municipal borough was created in 1866, which encompassed less than half of the manor&#x27;s territory. The area now known as Glossop approximates to the villages that used to be called Glossopdale, on the lands of the Duke of Norfolk. Originally a centre of wool processing, Glossop rapidly expanded in the late 18th century when it specialised in the production and printing of calico, a coarse cotton. It became a mill town with many chapels and churches; its fortunes were tied to the cotton industry.

Architecturally, the area is dominated by buildings constructed with the local sandstone; a number of these, including Glossop Gasworks, are grade II listed. Two significant former cotton mills and the Dinting railway viaduct remain.

The name Glossop is thought to be of Anglo-Saxon origin, named during the Angles&#x27; settlement in the 7th century, and derived from &quot;Glott&#x27;s Hop&quot;—where &quot;hop&quot; could mean a valley, a small valley in a larger valley system, or a piece of land enclosed by marshes and &quot;Glott&quot; was probably a chieftain&#x27;s name. Because of its size and location, Glossop had many definitions. The village of Glossop is now called Old Glossop. Howard Town and Milltown gained importance. They were named New Town and then Glossop. Local government reorganisations had caused the Glossopdale villages to be promoted to a municipal borough and then have that status removed. Land has been added to Glossop and other lands removed. From a small settlement it became an ancient parish, a manor, a borough and a township. Currently, two county divisions in High Peak Borough, Derbyshire, have Glossop as part of their names.

===Ancient===
There is evidence of a Bronze Age burial site on Shire Hill (near Old Glossop) and other possibly prehistoric remains at Torside (on the slopes of Bleaklow). The Romans arrived in 78 AD. At that time, the area was within the territory of the Brigantes tribe, whose main base was in Yorkshire. In the late 1st century the Romans built a fort, Ardotalia, on high ground above the river in present-day Gamesley. The site of this fort was rediscovered in 1771 by an amateur historian, John Watson. It subsequently acquired the name Melandra Castle. The extensive site has been excavated, revealing fort walls, a shrine and the fort headquarters. The area has been landscaped to provide parking and picnic areas.

===Medieval===
King William I awarded the manor of Glossop to William Peverel, who began construction of Glossop Castle, but the entire estate was later confiscated. In 1157 King Henry II gave the manor of Glossop to Basingwerk Abbey. They gained a market charter for Glossop in 1290, and one for Charlesworth in 1328.
In 1433, the monks leased all of Glossopdale to the Talbot family, later Earls of Shrewsbury. In 1494, an illegitimate son of the family, Dr John Talbot, was appointed vicar of Glossop. He founded a school, and paved the packhorse route over the moors; this is known as Doctor&#x27;s Gate.

At the dissolution of the monasteries in 1537 the manor of Glossop was given to the Talbot family. In 1606 it came into the ownership of the Howard family, the Dukes of Norfolk, who held it for the next 300 years. Glossop was usually given to the second son of the family.
The land was too wet and cold to be used for wheat but was ideal for the hardy Pennine sheep, so agriculture was predominantly pastoral. Most of the land was owned by the Howards and was leasehold and it was only in Whitfield that there was any freehold land. The few houses were solid, built of the local stone, and allowed for the development of home industries such as wool spinning and weaving.

===Industrial and civic history===

The medieval economy was based on sheep pasture and the production of wool by farmers who were tenants of the Abbot of Basingwerk and later the Talbot family. During the Industrial Revolution of the 18th century Glossop became a centre for cotton spinning. A good transport network between Liverpool and Glossop brought in imported cotton which was spun by a labour force with wool spinning skills. The climate of Glossopdale provided abundant soft water that was used to power mills and finish the cloth, and also gave the humidity necessary to spin cotton under tension. Initial investment was provided by the Dukes of Norfolk. By 1740, cotton in an unspun form had been introduced to make fustians and lighter cloths.

====Mills====
The first mills in Glossop were woollen mills. In 1774, Richard Arkwright opened a mill at Cromford. He developed the factory system and patented machines for spinning cotton and carding. In 1785, his patents expired and many people copied Arkwright&#x27;s system and his patents, exemplified by the Derwent Valley Mills. By 1788 there were over 200 Arkwright-type mills in Britain. At the same time there were 17 cotton mills in Derbyshire, principally in Glossop. By 1831 there were at least 30 mills in Glossopdale, none of which had more than 1,000 spindles. The mill owners were local men: the Wagstaffs and Hadfields were freeholders from Whitfield; the Shepleys, Shaws, Lees, Garlicks and Platts had farmed the dale. The Sidebottoms were from Hadfield, the Thornleys were carpenters and John Bennet and John Robinson were clothiers.
John Wood of Marsden came from Manchester in 1819 and bought existing woollen mills which he expanded. These were the Howard Town mills. Francis Sumner was a Catholic whose family had connections with Matthew Ellison, Howard&#x27;s agent. He built Wren Nest Mill. The Sidebottoms built the Waterside Mill at Hadfield. In 1825, John Wood installed the first steam engine and power looms. Sumner and Sidebottom followed suit and the three mills, Wren Nest, Howardtown and Waterside, became very large vertical combines (a vertical combine was a mill that both spun the yarn and then used it to weave cloth). With the other major families, the Shepleys, Rhodes and Platts, they dominated the dale. In 1884, the six had 82% of the spinning capacity with 892,000 spindles and 13,571 looms. Glossop was a town of very large calico mills. The Glossop Tramway was opened in 1903 to connect workers to the various mills along the main routes between Glossop and Hadfield.

The calico printing factory of Edmund Potter (located in Dinting Vale) in the 1850s printed 2½ million pieces of printed calico, of which 80% was for export. The paper industry was created by Edward Partington who, as Olive and Partington, bought the Turn Lee Mill in 1874 to produce high-quality paper from wood pulp by the sulphite method. He expanded rapidly with mills in Salford and Barrow-in-Furness. He merged with Kellner of Vienna and was created Lord Doverdale in 1917. He died in 1925; his factories in Charlestown created nearly 1,000 jobs.

====Religion and benevolence====
Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk, rebuilt the old parish church in 1831, built All Saints Roman Catholic chapel in 1836, improved the Hurst Reservoir in 1837, built a primary school next to the church, and built the Town Hall, whose foundation stone was laid on Coronation Day 1838.

The Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway came to Dinting in 1842, but it was the 13th Duke of Norfolk who built the spur line to Howard Town, so that coal could be brought from the collieries at Dukinfield. Glossop railway station bears the lion, the symbol of the Norfolks. Many of the street- and placenames in Glossop derive from the names and titles of the Dukes of Norfolk, such as Norfolk Square, and a cluster of residential streets off Norfolk Street that were named after Henry Howard, 13th Duke of Norfolk, the first Catholic MP since the Reformation. (His second son was created 1st Baron Howard of Glossop and was ancestor of the post-1975 dukes.)

A two-storey Township Workhouse was built between 1832 and 1834 on Bute Street (). Its administration was taken over by Glossop Poor Law Union in December 1837. The workhouse buildings included a 40-bed infirmary, piggeries and casual wards for vagrants. The workhouse later became Glossop Public Assistance Institution and from 1948 the N.H.S. Shire Hill Hospital.

The mill owners, Catholics, Anglican, Methodist and Unitarian, built reading rooms and chapels. They worked together and worshipped together with their workers. The Woods, Sidebottoms and Shepleys were Anglicans and hence Tory, and they dominated every vestry, which was the only form of local government before 1866. They built four churches St James&#x27;s, Whitfield in 1846, St Andrew&#x27;s, Hadfield in 1874, Holy Trinity, Dinting in 1875 and St Luke&#x27;s, Glossop. Francis Sumner and the Ellisons and Norfolks were Catholic and built St Charles&#x27;s, Hadfield and St Mary&#x27;s, Glossop. The smaller mill owners were Dissenters and congregated at Littlemoor Independent Chapel built in Hadfield in 1811, but they later built a further eleven chapels.

For decades there was rivalry between Edward Partington, his friend Herbert Rhodes, and the Woods and Sidebottoms. The Woods built the public baths and laid out the park. Partington built the library. Partington built the cricket pavilion, so Samuel Hill-Wood sponsored the football club that for one season, 1899–1900, played in League Division One. He and his descendants went on to be chairmen of the London club, Arsenal. He was MP for High Peak from 1910 to 1929. Edward&#x27;s son, Oswald, was MP for High Peak from 1900 to 1910. Ann Kershaw Woods devoted herself to Anglican education and had schools built.

====Cotton famine and industrial relations====
In 1851, 38% of the men and 27% of the women were employed in cotton; the only alternative employment was agriculture, building, or labouring on the railway. Consequently, the town was vulnerable to interruptions in the supply of cotton or the export trade. The American Civil War caused the cotton famine of 1861–64. The mill owners met together and put in place a relief programme through which they supplied food, clogs and coal to their employees. Howard increased the workforce on his estate, and public works (such as improving the domestic water supply) were undertaken. They provided unsecured loans to the workers until the cotton returned. The relationship between the owners and men was one of paternal benevolence. They lived in the same community and worshipped in the same churches. The mill owners were the local aldermen, the church elders and led the sports teams. In the Luddite and Chartist times and the period following Peterloo, Glossop was virtually unaffected, despite its proximity to Hyde, a radical hotbed. In the &#x27;4s 2d or swing strike&#x27; it was incomers from Ashton who stopped the Glossop mills. The rivalry in Glossop was not based on class but on religious groups.

===Modern (20th and 21st centuries)===

The decline of cotton spinning has resulted in the closure of many of the town&#x27;s mills. The Howard family sold the Glossop Estate in 1925 and donated large areas to the people of Glossop. Manor Park was the location of the family&#x27;s manor house and gardens. The recession of 1929 hit Glossop very hard: in 1929 the unemployment rate was 14%, and in 1931 it was 55%. In Hadfield it reached 67%. National initiatives to improve housing and employment conditions largely failed, and mills fell empty and decayed. Unemployment remained at 36% in 1938. The Second World War changed this: military stores, metals, machine tools, munitions, rubber and essential industries moved into the empty factories and left Glossop with a more diverse range of industries.

In spite of the Barlow Report and government intervention, no significant employer moved into Glossop.

Gamesley underwent considerable change in the 1960s, when a large council estate was built, mainly to house people from Manchester. These housing areas, called &#x27;Overspill estates&#x27;, were also built in other towns surrounding Manchester.

===Plans===

Glossop has been included as pilot in the Liveability scheme, and has drawn up the Glossop Vision masterplan for the improvement and gentrification of the town. This is being partially funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. It aims to open up access to the Glossop Brook, to coordinate developments in Glossop town centre, to enhance the built environment and to link the town to its wider setting. As such, the mills have become a retail development with housing, trees are to be planted along the A57 and the market square has been pedestrianised.

==Governance==

In the local government reorganisation of 1974 the Municipal Borough of Glossop was abolished, and since then the two levels of local government are Derbyshire County Council, based in Matlock, and High Peak Borough Council then based in Chapel-en-le-Frith.

Glossop was included in the &quot;South East Lancashire Special Review Area&quot; under the Local Government Act 1958, and the Redcliffe-Maud Report of 1969 recommended its inclusion in a South East Lancashire–North East Cheshire metropolitan area. Glossop was not ultimately included in the Greater Manchester area established by the Local Government Act 1972, with the residents voting to remain in Derbyshire in 1973. The county council, originally based in Derby, moved to Matlock in the late 1950s to facilitate easier travelling to the county hall from the northern extremities such as Glossop and the High Peak.

For the county council, Glossop is split between the divisions of Glossop and Charlesworth (electing two councillors), and Etherow (electing one councillor). Etherow division contains Hadfield North, Hadfield South, Gamesley and the large and sparsely populated Tintwistle ward, which was formerly in Cheshire. These boundaries were set in 2013.

At the district level, that is High Peak Borough Council, Glossop comprises these wards: Dinting, Gamesley, Hadfield North, Hadfield South, Old Glossop, Padfield, Howard Town, Simmondley and Whitfield. St John&#x27;s represents the rural area that was formerly Glossopdale RDC and lies within the National Park. These were the wards used in the 2001 Census.

Glossop itself does not have a parish council, but Tintwistle and St John&#x27;s are parished.

The Member of Parliament for the High Peak constituency since 2024 has been Jon Pearce.

===Historic Glossop===

Historically, the ancient parish of Glossop consisted of the ten townships of the manor: Glossop, Hadfield, Padfield, Dinting, Simmondley, Whitfield, Chunal, Charlesworth, Chisworth, Ludworth and nine more: Mellor, Thornsett, Rowarth, Whittle (Whitle), Beard, Ollersett, Hayfield, Little Hayfield, Phoside, Kinder, Bugsworth, Brownside and Chinley. Within the parish were the chapelries of Hayfield and Mellor. The ancient parish was in the Hundred of High Peak; it was about in length and wide, with an area of . Beard, Ollerset, Thornsett, Rowarth and Whitle later formed the town of New Mills, while Hayfield, Little Hayfield, Phoside and Kinder joined the parish of Hayfield. The chapelry of Mellor included Mellor, Chisworth, Ludworth, Whittle and part of Thornsett.

The Manor of Glossop was made up of the territory that includes Hadfield, Padfield, Dinting, Simmondley, Whitfield, Chunal, Charlesworth, Chisworth, Ludworth and the village of Glossop, now called Old Glossop. It had an area of , of which more than were classed as moorland.
The Municipal Borough of Glossop (1866–1974) contained the land within of the town hall in Howard Town and a sliver to the north bounded by the River Etherow, an area of . It is cited as an example of a &#x27;millocracy&#x27; as two-thirds of the elected councillors were mill owners. The remaining parishes of Charlesworth, Chisworth and Ludworth formed Glossopdale Rural District, which remained in existence until 1934 when the parishes were split, Ludworth going into Marple RDC, Chisworth and the greater part of Charlesworth joining Chapel en le Frith RDC and the smaller part——joining Glossop.

The present community of Glossop is centred on Howardtown. It is served by the Glossopdale Area Forum and the Glossop Town Partnership.
The previous hamlet of Glossop is now known as Old Glossop.

==Geography==
Glossop is at the north-western extreme of England&#x27;s East Midlands region, north-west of London, east of the city of Manchester, west of the city of Sheffield and north of Derby. It nestles in the foothills of the Pennines, with Bleaklow to the north-east and Kinder Scout to the south. It lies on Glossop Brook, a tributary of the River Etherow, in the area of peat moorland commonly known as the Dark Peak. The moors, which rise to over , are cut by many deep V-shaped valleys known as cloughs, each formed by a stream known as a brook. Shelf Brook passes through Old Glossop where it joins Hurst Brook to form Glossop Brook, which passes westward through Milltown, Howard Town and Dinting to the River Etherow, which in turn runs south to join the River Goyt at Marple Bridge. Two other notable brooks are Padfield Brook and Gnat Hole Brook.

Shelf Brook leads from Shelf Moor on Bleaklow down Doctor&#x27;s Gate through Old Glossop to Glossop Brook. The valley was used by the Romans for a road, and currently contains a bridleway. The north slope of Holden Clough and Hurst Brook is used by the A57 road known as the Snake Pass. The Snake Pass crosses the Pennine Way near Doctor&#x27;s Gate Culvert ( above sea level) before descending to the east to Ladybower Reservoir along the northern side of the River Ashop valley. Here a road leads east over Hallam Moor into Sheffield, and south along the River Derwent into Baslow and Matlock. To the north of Glossop is Tintwistle; the River Etherow is the boundary. Today, the Longdendale valley forms a chain of reservoirs that provide drinking water for Manchester. At the head of the valley is Woodhead, where the road from Huddersfield joins the road to Sheffield, and a railway tunnel brought the railway from Penistone.

===Geology===

Directly beneath Glossop lie areas of Carboniferous Millstone Grit, shales and sandstone. Glossop is on the edge of the Peak District Dome, at the southern edge of the Pennine anticline. The Variscan uplift has caused much faulting and Glossopdale was the product of glacial action in the last glaciation period that exploited the weakened rocks. The steep-sided valleys of the cloughs cause significant erosion and deposition. The layers of sandstone, mudstones and shale in the bedrock act as an aquifer to feed the springs. The valley bottoms have a thin deposit of boulder clay. The brooks are fed by the peaty soils of the moors thus are acid (pH5.5–7.0); this means the instream wildlife is dependent on food sources from outside the channel.

===Climate===
Glossop experiences a temperate maritime climate, like much of the British Isles, with relatively cool summers and mild winters. There is regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year. Glossop has a history of flash flooding, the most recent being in 2002 when High Street West was flooded to a depth of .

==Demography==
Glossop demographics were recorded as the following:


==Economy==
Glossop was a product of the wealth of the cotton industry. Glossop&#x27;s economy was linked closely with a spinning and weaving tradition that had evolved from developments in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. Before the First World War, Glossop had the headquarters of an international paper empire, the largest calico printworks in the world, a large bleach works and six spinning weaving combines with over 600,000 spindles and 12,000 looms and two niche manufacturers: grindstones and industrial belts. In the 1920s, these firms were refloated on the easily available share capital—thus were victims of the stock market crash of 1929. Their product lines were vulnerable to the new economic conditions.

The main street contains a variety of shops, restaurants and food outlets.

Glossop is located close to the border of the Peak National Park, and to the east are the open moorlands of the Dark Peak. The local economy benefits from the many thousands of tourists who visit the park each year and who use Glossop as the &quot;Gateway to the Peak&quot;.

==Landmarks==

===Wren Nest Mill===
Wren Nest Mill on High Street West was built c. 1800–10, with further extensions in 1815 and 1818, the latter incorporating an octagonal tower. The present building is a small part of the original complex, which in its heyday employed 1,400 workers operating 123,000 spindles and 2,541 looms. It ceased trading in 1955. A major fire in 1996 destroyed half the mill. The remaining half has been redeveloped into flats and retail units.
===Wood&#x27;s Mill, Howardtown Mills, Milltown Mills===
From a group of small mills at Bridge End, John Wood built a complex of mills. Bridge End Mill was originally built in 1782 as a fulling mill. Today one mill building is being restored, and the Milltown mills lie idle.
===Town Hall===
Glossop Town Hall and Market Hall was designed in Italianate style by Sheffield architects Weightman and Hadfield. The foundation stone was laid on 28 June 1838, the Coronation Day of Queen Victoria. The buildings were opened on 10 July 1845. Cost of construction exceeded £8,500. The facilities included a lock-up with four cells heated by hot water.
===Dinting Viaduct===
The viaduct was built in 1845, and later reinforced with additional piers. An accident occurred in 1855, when an MS&amp;LR passenger train was stopped by signalling on the viaduct at night. Two men and a woman mistook the parapet of the viaduct for the station platform at Hadfield, alighted from the train and fell 75 feet to their deaths.

=== Webster Bridge ===
Webster Bridge crosses Glossop Brook at a spot many locals call the &#x27;Sandhole&#x27;. It is a popular spot for local amateur photographers and is earmarked for improved access under Glossop&#x27;s Active Travel Masterplan.

===Parish Church of All Saints===

The present-day (2008) fabric of the parish church of All Saints is mostly of the 20th century; very little remains of the previous churches on this site.
The first mention of a church in Glossop is in the charter of 1157 conferring the manor of Glossop on Basingwerk Abbey. Although the dedication of the church to All Saints may indicate an Anglo-Saxon origin, no trace of such a church has been found. The first recorded vicar is William, of 1252. At this time the church was probably aisleless. It was altered in the 15th century when the nave was rebuilt with arcades, aisles and a still-extant (2008) arch at the east end of the north aisle. In 1554 a new and taller tower with a broach spire was built 3 feet west of the old tower, incorporating the east wall of the previous tower. The nave was completely rebuilt in 1831, with removal and replacement of much of the old fabric including the tracery of the aisle windows. The work was carried out by the firm of E. W. Drury of Sheffield, the cost far exceeding the initial estimate of £700. When the nave was rebuilt in 1914 it was discovered that the arch leading to the chancel had been partly made up of plaster, the wall supported by this arch had not been bonded into the existing chancel walls, and the &quot;oak&quot; roof bosses were also plaster. Between the pillars of the nave sleeper walls had been built to a higher level than the pillar bases. These walls appear to have been needed to counteract the effects on the church structure of a combination of excess drainage from the nearby hillside and the numerous burials inside the church. The pillars of the new nave of 1914 were superimposed on the bases of the old pillars, and the floor built up to cover the sleeper walls.

The tower and chancel were demolished and rebuilt in 1853–55, the new tower also having a broach spire. The chancel was again rebuilt in 1923, completing the architect C. M. Hadfield&#x27;s plan of 1914. The present church has a nave of 5 bays, 25 yards long by 16 yards wide, with north and south aisles, and a chancel of 14 yards by 7 yards with a north aisle dedicated as St Catherine&#x27;s Chapel.

===Open spaces===
Two public open spaces in Glossop have been given the Green Flag Award: Manor Park close to the town centre, which has views of the surrounding countryside, and Howard Park, which was described by the Award organisation as &quot;a good example of visionary layout from the Victorian era retaining many original features&quot;. Glossop&#x27;s parkrun takes place in Manor Park every Saturday at 9am. Harehills Park, with its riverside footpath and mature trees, has been identified by Glossop Vision as a strategic open space, and was donated by the 2nd Lord Howard of Glossop as a First World War memorial.

==Transport==
Early private horse-drawn buses were first provided by the Glossop Carriage Company Ltd, and an electric tramway connected Glossop with Hadfield between 1903 and 1927. Public transport in Glossop is now coordinated by Derbyshire County Council, with the exception of rail travel and some bus services being provided by Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM).

===Railway===
Glossop railway station is on the Glossop line between Manchester Piccadilly and Hadfield. There are generally half-hourly train services, increasing to every 20 minutes during rush hour, along this remaining stub of the former Woodhead Line.

A user group, the &quot;Friends of Glossop Station&quot;, are working to make the station more attractive and to encourage greater use of public transport. The trains operated on the line are three-car Class 323 electric multiple units, built between 1992 and 1996 by Hunslet Transportation Projects.

===Buses===
There are regular bus services running to towns in Tameside, Buxton, New Mills, Whaley Bridge, the Hope Valley, Sheffield and infrequent services to Holmfirth.

Bus services in Glossop are operated predominantly by High Peak and by Stagecoach Manchester, with the Sheffield service operated by Hulleys of Baslow.

===Roads===
The main road through Glossop is the A57. To the west, this road (with the parallel M67 motorway) leads to Manchester, while Sheffield and the Hope Valley lie to the east, via the Snake Pass. The B6105 leads north then east, along the Woodhead Pass (A628) and eventually to the South Yorkshire town of Barnsley and the M1 motorway. Chapel-en-le-Frith, Buxton and Derby lie to the south, along the A624 and A6.

===Leisure===
The Peak District Boundary Walk runs along the eastern side of town through Charlestown and Old Glossop and the Pennine Bridleway passes the western side of town around Gamesley and Hadfield.

==Sport==
Glossop is the smallest town in England to have had a team in the top tier of the English football league system. Glossop North End were members of the Football League between 1898 and 1915; around the turn of the 20th century, they played in Division One. The team now plays in the North West Counties Football League Premier Division.

The town also has a number of sports clubs, including tennis, golf, rugby union, cricket, bowls, running, cycling and sailing at Torside reservoir.

==Culture==

===Performing arts===
Partington Theatre is an amateur theatre with a 120-seat venue in the centre of the town. It runs six plays each season and was established in 1954. The building was started in 1914 and completed in 1917.

Glossop Improv is an improvisation group for adults, running drop-in workshops online and in-person.

Glossop &amp; District Choral Society is a community choir founded in 1949 by Margaret Lomas.

Glossop Operatic and Dramatic Society was an amateur musical/drama society established in 1976.

===Community events===

Glossop Victorian Weekend was the biggest weekend event in Glossop and was featured on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Songs of Praise&quot;. The weekend included many activities, including a Grand Victorian Costume Competition and a Shop Window Competition. The Victorian Weekend was discontinued in 2009 due to lack of local support. Running parallel with the Victorian Weekend was Glossop Beer Festival, run by the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) and featuring over 30 beers and a barbecue in Glossop&#x27;s Labour Club.

Glossop has a range of other cultural activities including Peak Film Society, a film club. Many other activities, including Glossop Folk Club take place at Glossop Labour Club. Also at Glossop Labour Club is the monthly Glossop Record Club, which holds vinyl listening sessions on the second Thursday of each month.

Glossop has a thriving indoor and outdoor market where a wide selection of goods can be purchased. The indoor market is open every Thursday, Friday and Saturday, while the outdoor market is open every Friday and Saturday. The Outdoor Market is joined by the Local Produce Market on the 2nd Saturday of every month throughout the year.

The Crown Inn public house at 142 Victoria Street, built in the 1840s, is on the Campaign for Real Ale&#x27;s National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors.

==Emergency service provision==
Calls for service in the rural areas usually increase during the summer as the population is boosted by approximately twenty million visitors each year to the Peak District and its surrounds. Winter weather on the high ground around Glossop and Kinder Scout can also cause problems for traffic and residents.

===Hospitals===
State healthcare is provided for in Glossop and District by the NHS Derby and Derbyshire Integrated Care Board. Despite this, patients from the area use Tameside General Hospital located in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester because there are no district general hospitals (hospitals with an Accident and Emergency Department) within the borough of High Peak. The nearest hospital with A&amp;E facilities within the county is located at Chesterfield, some from the town by road.

===Ambulance and paramedics===
The North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) is the main ambulance service provider for the area, with an ambulance station based on Chapel Street. However, services are occasionally complimented and assisted by the East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) in times of high demand, or to assist with a major incident.

===Police and crime===
When Glossop was granted Municipal Borough Status in 1867, the Watch Committee elected to implement its own police force. Glossop Police remained independent until 1947 when they amalgamated with the Derbyshire Constabulary. The police station on Ellison Street is staffed by statutory police officers from B Division of Derbyshire Constabulary. It has a custody suite, five cells and an incident room. There are also a team of volunteer special constables and six police community support officers.

===Fire service===
General fire and rescue cover is provided by the Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service. Glossop fire station is based in the Charlestown area, just off the A624 road.

===Mountain rescue===
Specialised search and rescue services are provided by the volunteer Glossop Mountain Rescue Team, part of the Peak District Mountain Rescue Organisation. Their remit is to &#x27;save lives in the mountains and moorlands&#x27;.

==Twin town==
Glossop is twinned with Bad Vilbel, a spa town in the Wetteraukreis district of Hesse, Germany, north-east of Frankfurt.

In 1985 the Glossop–Bad Vilbel Twinning Association was established. Its aims are:To promote and foster friendship and understanding between the people of Glossop and district and those of Bad Vilbel and district in Germany.

To encourage visits by individuals and groups to and from the linked towns, particularly by children and young people, and the development of personal contacts, and by doing so to broaden the mutual understanding of the cultural, recreational, educational and commercial activities of the linked towns.

In 1987 formal twinning ceremonies were held in both towns, with a tree being planted in Norfolk Square. The Twinning Association arranges for visitors to stay with families.
The two signatories of the charter were Catherine Holtom, the Mayor of High Peak, and Gunther Biwer, Bürgermeister of Bad Vilbel.

==Literature and the media==
Hilaire Belloc wrote about Glossop in a letter to a Miss Hamilton in 1909: &quot;Do you know the filthy village of Glossop? It is inhabited entirely by savages. I tried every inn in the place and found each inn worse than the last. It stinks for miles. Rather than sleep in such a den I started walking back to Manchester with a huge bag...&quot;

Glossop is mentioned in the satirical book &quot;England, Their England&quot; by A. G. Macdonell. The town&#x27;s fictional newspaper, the &quot;Glossop Evening Mail&quot;, is described as the lowest rung in the journalistic profession.

In 2013, Old Glossop was used for filming in the BBC drama series &quot;The Village&quot;, starring John Simm and Maxine Peake. The Parish Church of All Saints and the former Duke of Norfolk school building appeared in the series.

Local newspapers includes the &quot;Glossop Advertiser&quot; newspaper owned by the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;, the &quot;Glossop Chronicle&quot;, the &quot;Buxton Advertiser&quot;, the &quot;Glossop Gazette&quot;,

Regional TV news comes from Salford-based BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from Winter Hill and the local relay transmitters.

<doc id="113558" wikidata="Q216486" url="?curid=113558" title="Continental Airlines">
<text>Continental Airlines (simply known as Continental) was a major airline in the United States that operated from 1934 until it merged with United Airlines in 2012. It had ownership interests and brand partnerships with several carriers.

Continental started out as one of the smaller carriers in the United States, known for its limited operations under the regulated era that provided very fine, almost fancy, service against the larger majors in important point-to-point markets, the largest of which was Chicago/Los Angeles. However, deregulation in 1978 changed the competitive landscape and realities, as noted by Smithsonian Airline Historian R. E. G. Davies, &quot;Unfortunately, the policies that had been successful for more than forty years under (Robert) Six&#x27;s cavalier style of management were suddenly laid bare as the cold winds of airline deregulation changed all the rules—specifically, the balance between revenues and expenditures.&quot;

In 1981, Texas International Airlines acquired a controlling interest in Continental. The companies were merged in 1982, moved to Houston, and grew into one of the country&#x27;s largest carriers despite facing financial and labor issues, eventually becoming one of the more successful airlines in the United States.

Continental and United Airlines merged in an $8.5 billion all-stock merger of equals on October 1, 2010. Continental&#x27;s shareholders received 1.05 per share in United stock for each Continental share they owned. Upon completion of the acquisition, UAL Corporation changed its name to United Continental Holdings. During the integration period, each airline ran a separate operation under the direction of a combined leadership team, based in Chicago. The integration was completed on March 3, 2012. Although the merged airline retained the United name, it uses Continental&#x27;s operating certificate and livery. On June 27, 2019, United changed its parent company name from United Continental Holdings to United Airlines Holdings.

==History==
===Early history===
Varney Speed Lines (named after one of its initial owners, Walter T. Varney, who was also a founder of United Airlines) was formed in 1934, operating airmail and passenger services in the American Southwest over a route originating from El Paso and extending through Albuquerque, Santa Fe, and Las Vegas, New Mexico, to Pueblo, Colorado. The airline commenced operations with the Lockheed Vega, a single-engine plane that carried four passengers. Varney was awarded a 17-cent-rate airmail contract between Pueblo and El Paso; it carried passengers as a sideline. Following cancellation of all domestic airmail contracts by the Roosevelt administration in 1934, Robert F. Six learned of an opportunity to buy into the Southwest Division of Varney Speed Lines which needed money to handle its newly won Pueblo-El Paso route. Six was introduced to Louis Mueller (who would serve as chairman of the board of Continental until February 28, 1966). Mueller had helped found the Southwest Division of Varney in 1934 with Walter T. Varney. As an upshot of all this, Six bought into the airline with US$90,000 and became general manager on July 5, 1936. The carrier was renamed Continental Air Lines (later changed to &quot;Airlines&quot;) on July 8, 1937. Six relocated the airline&#x27;s headquarters to Denver Union (later Stapleton) Airport in Denver in October 1937. Six changed the name to &quot;Continental&quot; because he wanted the airline name to reflect his desire to have the airline fly all directions throughout the United States.

During World War II, Continental&#x27;s Denver maintenance base converted Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses, Boeing B-29 Superfortresses and North American P-51 Mustangs for the United States Army Air Forces. Profits from military transportation and aircraft conversion enabled Continental to contemplate expansion and acquisition of new airliners after the war. Among those were the Douglas DC-3, the Convair 240 and the Convair 340. The Convairs were Continental&#x27;s first pressurized airliners. The airline&#x27;s early route was El Paso to Albuquerque and Denver, with routes being added during the war from Denver, Albuquerque, and El Paso eastward across Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas. In 1946 Continental flew Denver to Kansas City, Wichita, Tulsa, and to Oklahoma City, and from El Paso and Albuquerque to San Antonio. Each route included stops in several of 22 smaller cities.

In the early 1950s, Continental began several interchange routes with American, Braniff, and United Airlines. Routes were operated on American from Los Angeles and San Francisco to El Paso continuing onto Continental&#x27;s route to San Antonio and Houston. Continental&#x27;s Denver to Kansas City route would interchange onto St. Louis with Braniff Airways and United&#x27;s routes from Seattle and Portland to Denver would interchange with Continental&#x27;s routes onto Wichita and Tulsa. These interchange routes continued for many years until Continental was able to secure routes of its own between each city.

In 1955, Continental merged with Pioneer Air Lines, gaining access to 16 more cities in Texas and New Mexico. In August 1953, Continental flew to 35 airports and Pioneer flew to 19, but Continental&#x27;s network didn&#x27;t reach beyond Denver, El Paso, Houston and Kansas City until April 1957 when it started Chicago-Denver-Los Angeles, two Douglas DC-7Bs a day each way. Pioneer&#x27;s Executive Vice President Harding Luther Lawrence arrived at Continental as a result of the merger. Bob Six commented on more than one occasion that, &quot;the reason we bought Pioneer was to get Harding.&quot; Harding Lawrence implemented several innovative changes at Continental as well as a flamboyant advertising campaign during his ten years as Six&#x27;s protege. During Lawrence&#x27;s tenure Continental grew by 500 percent. Lawrence left Continental in April 1965 to head Braniff Airways.

Six petitioned the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) for longer routes to larger cities, hoping to transform the regional into a trunkline like United Airlines, TWA, and American Airlines. He was discussing with Boeing for Continental to become one of the first to operate the soon-to-be-launched 707. The timing was crucial, since new routes would justify the 707s, and vice versa.

===1960s===
Continental Airlines had seen a broad expansion of its routes, thanks to a responsive CAB and persistent efforts by Six and Executive Vice President Harding Lawrence (who came to Continental in the Pioneer merger), who both frequently referred to his company as &quot;the Airline that needs to grow.&quot; In 1958 Continental began turboprop flights with the Vickers Viscount on the new medium-haul routes. The British-manufactured Viscount four engine turboprop, which Continental referred to as the &quot;Jet Power Viscount II&quot;, was the first turbine powered aircraft operated by the airline with Continental claiming it was &quot;First in the west with jet-power flights&quot;. The CAB permitted Continental to drop service at many smaller cities, enabling the carrier&#x27;s new aircraft to operate more economically on longer flights. In 1960 Continental flew more than three times the passenger-miles it had in 1956. (&quot;Aviation Week&quot; June 22, 1959: &quot;Continental&#x27;s current re-equipment program—involving a total cost of $64 million for the Boeings, Viscounts and DC-7Bs—was launched in 1955 when the carrier&#x27;s net worth amounted to $5.5 million.&quot;)

During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Six was the airline industry&#x27;s leading lower-fare advocate. He predicted that increased traffic, not higher fares, was the answer to the airline industry&#x27;s problems. To amazement from the industry, he introduced the economy fare on the Chicago-Los Angeles route in 1962. He later pioneered a number of other low or discount fares which made air travel available to many who could not previously afford it. One of Continental&#x27;s early innovations was a system-wide economy excursion fare which cut the standard coach fares by more than 25%. Continental took delivery of the first of five 707-124s in spring 1959, and started Chicago-Los Angeles nonstop on June 8. Having so few jets, Continental needed radical innovations to the 707 maintenance program. It developed the &quot;progressive maintenance&quot; program, which enabled Continental to fly its 707 fleet seven days a week, achieving greater aircraft utilization than any other jet operator in the industry. Six, not being satisfied with 707 service, introduced innovations and luxe cuisine on Continental&#x27;s 707 flights which were described as, &quot;... nothing short of luxurious&quot; by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and, &quot;... clearly, the finest in the airline industry&quot; by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;.
In the early 1960s, Continental added flights from Los Angeles to Houston, nonstop as well as via Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso, Midland-Odessa, Austin, and/or San Antonio. In 1963, the company headquarters moved from Denver to Los Angeles. By late 1963, Continental had discontinued service to most of its smaller cities in Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas with the exception of Lawton, OK and Wichita Falls, TX which continued operating with DC-9 and 727 jets until 1977. Total passenger-miles in 1967 were more than five times greater than in 1960, but 61% of the 1967 total was on unscheduled flights (mostly transpacific charters). During the late 1960s the company disposed of the last of its turboprop and piston-powered aircraft—one of the first U.S. airlines to do so. Continental replaced the Viscount fleet with Douglas DC-9-10s and then added Boeing 727-100s and 727-200s. The DC-9 and 727 were to become the workhorses of the fleet from the late 1960s. The DC-9s were phased out by the late 1970s (although the type reappeared after mergers in the 1980s with an example being Texas International Airlines DC-9s which were added to the CO fleet); the 727-200 was the mainstay of its narrow-body fleet until the late 1980s. In 1968 a new livery was launched: orange and gold cheatlines on a white fuselage; and a black &quot;jetstream&quot; logo (by Six&#x27;s friend, the noted graphic designer Saul Bass) on the iconic &quot;Golden Tails&quot; of the airline&#x27;s aircraft. The slogans adopted in 1968 and used for more than a decade were, &quot;The Airline That Pride Built&quot; and, &quot;The Proud Bird with the Golden Tail&quot;. 1960s saw international routes awarded to Continental (to New Zealand and Australia) in the Transpacific Case, but they were cancelled by the Nixon Administration.
During the Vietnam War, Continental provided extensive cargo and troop transportation for United States Army and Marine Corps forces to Asian and the Pacific bases. Continental&#x27;s long range Boeing 707-324Cs were the most common non-military aircraft transiting Saigon Tan Son Nhat airport; in 1967, 39% of CO&#x27;s passenger-miles were on scheduled flights. With Continental&#x27;s experience in Pacific operations, the carrier formed subsidiary Air Micronesia in May 1968, inaugurating island hopping routes between Yap/Saipan/Guam, Majuro, Rota, Truk, Ponape (Pohnpei) and Honolulu. &quot;Air Mike&quot;, as it was known, initially operated with Boeing 727-100 aircraft with open-ocean survival gear, doppler radar, and a large complement of spare parts (including tires). A senior mechanic flew on every Air Mike flight until the late 1970s. Air Micronesia operated as subsidiary Continental Micronesia until 2010. In September 1969, Continental began flights from Los Angeles to Honolulu/Hilo and one month later from Albuquerque to Chicago, San Antonio, and San Francisco. In 1970, Continental was awarded routes from Seattle and Portland to San Jose, Hollywood-Burbank Airport, and Ontario, California—all of them growing markets.

In 1963, Continental denied employment to African-American pilot and Air Force veteran, Marlon D. Green. A United States Supreme Court decision allowed a Colorado anti-discrimination law to be applied to his case against Continental. Green flew with Continental for 13 years from 1965 until his retirement in 1978. His employment paved the way for the hiring of ethnic-minority pilots by all U.S. carriers, an industry milestone which was finally realized in 1977 after Southern Airways hired their first minority pilot.

===1970s===
At Six&#x27;s insistence, Continental (with Pan Am and Trans World Airlines) was one of the three launch airlines for the Boeing 747. On June 26, 1970, Continental became the second carrier (after TWA) to put the 747 into U.S. domestic service. Its upper-deck first class lounge and main deck &quot;Polynesian Pub&quot; won awards worldwide for the most refined cabin interior among all airlines, as did meal services developed by Continental&#x27;s Cordon Bleu-trained executive chef, Lucien DeKeyser. Continental&#x27;s 747 services from Chicago and Denver to Los Angeles and Honolulu set the standard for service in the western U.S. On June 1, 1972, Continental&#x27;s widebody DC-10 service began. Six had insisted that Continental place a large order for DC-10s with manufacturer McDonnell Douglas. This decision again proved prescient, since the publicity associated with Continental&#x27;s splashy 747 service Chicago-Denver-Los Angeles-Honolulu had stimulated increased market share and increased traffic for all carriers. Denver, Houston and Seattle were growing rapidly in the 1970s; the DC-10s took over most flights between Denver and Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston and Seattle, and between Houston and Los Angeles.
During the 1970s, Denver served as the airline&#x27;s main hub. The 747s were focused on the Chicago-Los Angeles-Honolulu routes, with one daily round trip through Denver. The DC-10s served large markets (Los Angeles to Chicago, Denver, Houston and Honolulu; and from Denver to Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle and Houston). DC-9s and 727s predominated elsewhere and added frequencies on DC-10 routes. Next to Braniff, Continental operated fewer aircraft types (four: the 747, DC-10, 727-200, and DC-9-10) during this period than any U.S. trunkline, affording savings in parts, maintenance, and crew training. The DC-10 enabled the airline to capitalize on traffic growth in the west. Continental saw market share grow annually in each DC-10 market through the 1970s, until relative market parity was achieved with United, the principal competitor on most of the DC-10 routes. The same innovations introduced on the 747s appeared on Continental&#x27;s DC-10s, including the &quot;Polynesian Pub&quot;, but after the 1973 oil crisis more seats were needed and the DC-10 pubs were removed. Continental phased out its 747s in 1978 in favor of the DC-10s (747s would return to Continental during the Lorenzo era, flying Newark to London and Paris). From the mid-1970s until it merged with Texas International, Continental operated only DC-10s, 727-100s, and 727-200s.

From 1961 to 1982, Continental was headquartered at the west end of the Los Angeles International Airport on World Way West. The facility included the general offices, system operations control, the central maintenance facility, flight kitchen, and Los Angeles crew bases.
In 1974, after years of delays and legal proceedings, Continental started flights between Houston and Miami, and on May 21, 1976, Continental was authorized to operate long-sought routes between San Diego and Denver. President Jimmy Carter and Civil Aeronautics Board chairman Alfred Kahn had been promoting deregulation of the airline industry, which would dissolve the CAB and for the first time in industry history allow U.S. carriers to determine without government supervision where they would fly, and how much they could charge. Continental began flights from Denver to Miami/Ft. Lauderdale and Tampa/St. Petersburg in Florida. That year, President Carter authorized Continental to begin daily round trips between Air Micronesia destination Saipan and Japan, and approved a route for Continental from Los Angeles to Australia via Honolulu, American Samoa, Fiji, New Zealand and Australia. The South Pacific service began May 1, 1979. After the 1978 passage of the Airline Deregulation Act Continental embarked on a route expansion. October 1978 saw Continental begin flights from the New York area airports to Houston and Denver, and from Denver to Phoenix. That month Continental started DC-10 flights between Los Angeles and Taipei, via Honolulu and Guam. Service between Houston and Washington, D.C., began in January 1979. In June 1979 Continental linked Denver with Washington, D.C., Las Vegas, San Francisco and San Jose and also began Houston-Tampa service. The airline suffered in 1979 when the DC-10 was grounded nationwide following the crash of American Airlines Flight 191. Continental Airlines only operated the DC-10 and the 727 at the time, so flights to Hawaii were cancelled during the grounding. By the time of the Texas Air Corp. acquisition in 1981, Continental&#x27;s post-deregulation growth had allowed it to penetrate every major U.S. airline market (and all of the regional markets) from the hubs in Denver and Houston, with the corresponding expansion of facilities at both of these airports. But that growth came at the cost of continuing losses. In Denver, Continental&#x27;s rapid growth provided the final impetus for the construction of the new Denver International Airport, which would be completed almost fifteen years later.
While deregulation allowed Continental to expand into new areas, it hurt the company&#x27;s existing business as consumers were for the first time able to choose lower fares over Continental&#x27;s better service. In 1978 Continental and Western Airlines, which held a nearby headquarters and similar fleet, began a nearly three-year attempt to merge. The route systems would have been complementary, with little overlap; although they both served the Western states, Continental had strength in Hawaii, southern-tier and the Great Plains states; Western&#x27;s strengths were in the California intrastate market, Alaska, Mexico, and the Intermountain West. Both airlines served the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountain states, but along different routes from Los Angeles, Denver, San Francisco, Seattle and Phoenix. The merger attempt failed when Texas Air Corporation interceded with its acquisition of Continental. With the Airline Deregulation Act the world changed for Continental as noted by Smithsonian historian R.E.G. Davies: &quot;Unfortunately, the policies that had been successful for more than forty years under (Robert) Six&#x27;s cavalier style of management were suddenly laid bare as the cold winds of airline deregulation changed all the rules -- specifically, the balance between revenues and expenditures.&quot;

===1980s===
In 1981, Texas Air Corporation, an airline holding company controlled by U.S. aviation entrepreneur Frank Lorenzo, acquired Continental after a contentious battle with Continental&#x27;s management who were determined to resist Lorenzo. Management teamed with unions to create a planned Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) that would have doubled the number of outstanding shares without shareholder approval, thus diluting Texas Air&#x27;s ownership stake and maintaining control of the airline. But management lost the legal battle to enact the ESOP without shareholder approval and with its 48.5 percent ownership stake, Texas Air could win any shareholder vote. During this struggle, in August 1981, Continental Airlines CEO Alvin Feldman died from suicide in his office and was succeeded by George Warde. In three letters left to his children, Feldman said he had been depressed since the death of his wife the previous year. Lorenzo became Continental Chairman and CEO in March 1982. He and his team viewed the company as stuck in the pre-deregulation era and in need of serious changes to be competitive. Continental was experiencing significant financial challenges both before and after Texas Air&#x27;s takeover, and management showed how Continental could not compete and survive with its cost structure. The pilots union agreed to some cost reductions in mid-1982, primarily through modest productivity improvements, but there was no progress with the other unions. On October 31, 1982, following approval by shareholders of both companies, Continental merged operations with Texas International, retaining the Continental identity and offering service to four continents (North and South America, Asia and Australia) with a fleet of 112 aircraft. Continental launched its frequent flyer program, initially called Travel Bank, in September 1982, following that of Texas International Airlines in 1979, which was the industry&#x27;s first frequent flyer program, and American Airlines AAdvantage program in 1981. In mid-1983, Continental relocated its headquarters to Texas International&#x27;s base in Houston, Texas, which resulted in a large expansion of its hub at Houston Intercontinental Airport and extensive new routes to Mexico and the south central U.S.
Even with the cost reductions from the pilots in 1982, Continental faced a major competitive threat in 1983 when American Airlines was able to implement two-tier wage structures with its unions. American planned massive, rapid growth through new hires at starting pay 50 percent lower than existing contracts and equitable with low-cost, startup carriers and well below Continental&#x27;s pay rates. American was already one of Continental&#x27;s main competitors, operating a larger hub 250 miles north of Continental&#x27;s southern hub in Houston and the growth that was funded by the lower pay rates was larger than all of Continental at the time.

In 1983, Continental went to its unions to restructure labor costs to compete with the startup carriers and American&#x27;s Plan B labor costs. After 19 months of negotiations, the International Association of Mechanics and Aerospace Workers went on strike in August 1983, even though the company was offering 20 percent pay raises in return for substantial productivity improvements. Continental was able to operate through the strike because many mechanics crossed picket lines and Continental hired new mechanics. The company continued to negotiate with the pilots and flight attendants and management gave a final proposal to its pilots in mid-September, which would have provided ownership by the pilots and other employees of 35 percent of the company&#x27;s stock in return for meaningful wage and productivity changes. With no agreement, Continental filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 24, 1983, and shut down for three days. Continental was the first airline to file for bankruptcy with a plan to continue operating as it did continuously starting September 27, 1983.

Airline unions fought Continental at every step. On October 1, 1983, the pilots and flight attendants joined the IAM, which was still on strike. When Continental resumed service three days after filing Chapter 11, it initially served 25 cities versus the more than 70 cities previously. In the initial stages of bankruptcy, with no legal agreement that would allow travel agents to book flights, passengers could only book directly with the airline. And, with no credit card agreements, Continental could only accept cash for travel. Continental began offering flights for only $49 for each nonstop segment, raising it later to $75 on any segment. In the federal courts, the unions unsuccessfully sued to stop the company&#x27;s reorganization. They were later successful in working to persuade Congress to pass a new bankruptcy law preventing bankrupt companies from terminating contracts as Continental had successfully done, but the law was too late to affect Continental. Chapter 11 saved the company from liquidation, but required substantial reorganization, which began immediately. Following bankruptcy, Continental was freed of its contractual obligations and imposed a series of new labor agreements on its union workers, sharply reducing the airline&#x27;s labor costs. Continental&#x27;s senior management also reduced their salaries to those of the pilots. The pilot strike was ultimately unsuccessful due to Continental pilots and new hires who crossed the picket line, and customers who voted with their pocketbook. Continental became vastly more competitive with the new airline startups then emerging and thriving in the southwestern U.S. By the end of 1984, Continental had grown back to be a larger airline than pre-bankruptcy and that year recorded a $50 million profit. Continental was the first airline to largely gradually replace a pilot workforce and the working pilots ultimately voted the union out.

On April 28, 1985, Continental inaugurated its first scheduled service to Europe with flights from Houston to London/Gatwick. Additional service from Newark to London and Paris started after the airline&#x27;s merger with PeopleExpress Airlines in 1987. With that merger came significant customer service issues, especially in the Northeast, for a period of time. In October 1985, Texas Air Corp. made an offer for a Denver-based regional carrier, Frontier Airlines, opening a bidding war with PeopleExpress, which was headed by Lorenzo&#x27;s former Texas International associate Don Burr. PeopleExpress paid a substantial premium for Frontier&#x27;s high-cost operation. The acquisition, funded by debt, did not seem rational to industry observers from either the route integration or the operating philosophy points of view. On August 24, 1986, Frontier filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations. With PeopleExpress losing money, Texas Air announced the acquisition of PeopleExpress on September 15, 1986, at the same time gaining Frontier, whose strong network in the Great Plains and intermountain West reinforced Continental&#x27;s already formidable Denver hub. The PeopleExpress acquisition also provided the option to acquire Terminal C at Newark Liberty International Airport and allow Continental to build a formidable hub in the New York market.

With a reorganization plan that repaid creditors 100 percent, Continental emerged from bankruptcy on June 30, 1986, with improved asset and cash flow positions and a more competitive route structure with routes radiating to every large U.S. city from major hubs at Denver and Houston. Continental also began developing its Midwest hub at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport in 1986, just as United Airlines began to transfer its Cleveland hub operations to Washington Dulles International Airport in Fairfax County, Virginia. In October 1986, American Airlines senior vice president Thomas G. Plaskett became the president and CEO of Continental Airlines. On February 1, 1987, People Express, Frontier, New York Air, and several commuter carriers were merged into Continental Airlines to create the sixth largest airline in the world and became the largest low-fare airline by introducing the industry&#x27;s first non-refundable airfares, initially called MaxSavers. The mergers and the aggressive marketing led to Continental becoming an even larger player in the northeastern markets. In July 1987, Plaskett resigned and Lorenzo returned to the position of CEO. 1987 saw the creation of Continental&#x27;s OnePass frequent flier program (jointly with Eastern Airlines); and, in 1988, Continental formed its first strategic partnership (and the first international airline alliance of its kind) with Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS). Continental also made a major image change with a blue and gray livery and the &quot;globe&quot; logo that was adopted by the post-merger United Airlines. The airline also eliminated first class service—and only the second global carrier to take that action—giving business class passengers the same first class seats, a service change later to be marketed as Business First.

===1990s===

On August 3, 1990, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Texas Air announced that Jet Capital Corporation, which owned controlling interest in Texas Air, was selling its interest to SAS. Under the agreements, Lorenzo would be leaving the active management of the airline as CEO for the first time in 18 years and would remain on the board of directors for two further years. At the same time, Hollis Harris, formerly President of Delta Air Lines, was named chairman and chief executive officer.

On December 3, 1990, due to the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the resultant Gulf War, which had prompted a dramatic increase in the price of jet fuel, Continental filed for bankruptcy. In mid-1991 Harris was replaced as CEO by Robert Ferguson, who had been a Texas Air executive. In November 1992, Continental accepted a $450 million buyout offer from an investor group composed of Air Partners, an investor from Texas led by Texas Pacific Group, and Air Canada. Under the arrangements, Air Canada would have 24 percent of the voting stock, while Air Partners would hold 41 percent of voting interest in the reorganized Continental. Continental emerged from bankruptcy in April 1993.
In March 1993, the airline cancelled its services to nine U.S. destinations and six non-U.S. destinations, including all 24 weekly services between the United States and Australia and New Zealand in addition to its flights between Guam and Australia, effective October 31 of that year. In 1994, Continental substantially reduced its jet services in Denver and terminated all turboprop operations, which had been unprofitable, reducing Denver from being a hub to a spoke city.
Between 1993 and 1995, Continental experimented with an &quot;airline within an airline&quot; by launching &quot;CALite&quot;, later renamed &quot;Continental Lite&quot;, which provided all-economy, low-fare, no-frills service between primarily leisure destinations. Continental Lite operated with a dedicated fleet of 100 McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30, Boeing 737-300, and Boeing 737-500 aircraft, each repainted with the &#x27;Lite&#x27; livery and stripped of its first class cabin. The service was based primarily at Continental&#x27;s existing hub in Cleveland as well as a new hub established in Greensboro, North Carolina. The experiment proved unsuccessful and was dissolved in 1995. Continental&#x27;s short-lived Greensboro hub was dismantled in the process. During this time period Continental was the subject of hostile takeover bids submitted by Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines.

Former Boeing executive Gordon Bethune became president and CEO in October 1994 and was elected chairman of the board of directors in 1996. Continental went from being ranked last in most performance categories to winning more J.D. Power and Associates awards for Customer Satisfaction than any other airline. &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; magazine named Bethune one of the top 25 Global Managers in 1996 and 1997. Under his leadership Continental&#x27;s stock price rose from $2 to over $50 per share. &quot;Fortune&quot; named Continental among the 100 Best Companies to Work for in America for six consecutive years. In his final year piloting the airline &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine ranked Continental 2004&#x27;s No. 1 Most Admired Global Airline, a title it earned again in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. While at Continental, Bethune created the Go-Forward plan, to fix problems with the airline, which included employee morale, the quality of the product, and the route structure, among others. Bethune began by ordering new aircraft in an effort to convert to an all-Boeing fleet.

Beginning in 1998, Continental again embarked on a program to expand its international operations. It inaugurated services to Ireland and Scotland, and in October 1998 the airline received its first Boeing 777-200ER aircraft, allowing nonstop flights from Newark and Houston to Tokyo–Narita, and from Newark to Tel Aviv, Israel. Continental in the same year launched partnerships with Northwest Airlines, Copa Airlines, Avant Airlines, Transbrasil, and Cape Air, and Continental and America West Airlines became the first two US airlines to launch interline electronic ticketing. In 1999, Continental Airlines started service between Newark and Zurich, Switzerland, and from Cleveland to London.

===2000s===

On March 1, 2001, Continental launched a nonstop service from Newark to Hong Kong, operating over the North circumpolar route. It was the first nonstop long-haul route for any airline with flying duration exceeding 16 hours. The service initiated a brief dispute between Continental, United Airlines and Cathay Pacific over rights to nonstop flights between Hong Kong and New York. On September 13, 2004, Continental entered the SkyTeam alliance along with Northwest/KLM and CSA. In 2005, Continental expanded service from Newark to Beijing after being awarded the China route. Among U.S. airlines, only Delta (with its extensive network of legacy routes dating from Delta&#x27;s acquisition of Pan American&#x27;s European network) served more European destinations than Continental.

In 2005, service to Asia was expanded as Continental introduced daily nonstop service between Newark and New Delhi, India. The success of this Newark-New Delhi route presaged establishment of a second gateway in India with the announcement of daily nonstop service to Mumbai. With the establishment of Mumbai service, Continental offered the most nonstop flights by any carrier from the United States to India. By May 2006, the carrier&#x27;s passenger traffic surpassed that of Northwest Airlines, and Continental became the fourth-largest U.S. carrier. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported on December 12, 2007, that Continental was in merger discussions with United Airlines. Of issue would be Continental&#x27;s golden share held by Northwest Airlines and the divestiture of Continental&#x27;s Guamanian hub. A deal was not &quot;certain or imminent&quot;, with the talks being of a preliminary nature. In April 2008, at the height of oil prices, Northwest announced a merger with Delta Air Lines. This allowed Continental to buy back the golden share from Northwest Airlines, which it did. Continental then renewed merger talks with United Airlines, but broke them off again that same month.
In May 2008, Continental Airlines sold its remaining 4.38 million share investment in Panamanian flag carrier Copa for $35.75 a share, netting proceeds of $149.8 million. Continental had been a principal shareholder in Copa. In June 2008, due to national and international economic conditions, Continental cut 3,000 jobs and the CEO and president had reduced salaries for the remainder of the year. The airline also reduced capacity and eliminated 67 mainline aircraft from its fleet by the end of 2009, retiring all of Continental&#x27;s 737-300s and all but 35 of its 737-500s. Continental also announced that it planned to withdraw from SkyTeam and would join Star Alliance in order to cooperate more extensively with United Airlines and other Star Alliance airlines. The new Continental-United relationship was characterized as a &quot;virtual merger&quot; in some circles.

In September 2008, Continental announced that it would commence providing seasonal non-stop service between Houston and Rio de Janeiro. The new nonstop flight was timed to provide roundtrip flight connections at Continental&#x27;s Houston hub to more than 160 cities throughout the U.S., Canada, Central America, Europe, and Asia. Continental renewed its lease for around in Continental Center I. Continental announced that its fourth quarter 2008 net loss widened to $266 million on costs for pilot retirement and reducing the value of its fuel hedges. In January 2009, Continental became the first commercial carrier to successfully demonstrate the use of sustainable biofuel to power an aircraft in North America. During the demonstration flight, Continental&#x27;s test pilots successfully conducted a number of flight maneuvers, and the biofuel met all performance requirements as compared with traditional jet fuel. The biofuel blend included components derived from algae and jatropha plants, both sustainable, second-generation sources that do not impact food crops or water resources or contribute to deforestation. In March 2009, Continental became the first U.S. carrier to inaugurate scheduled service between New York and Shanghai, China, with daily nonstop flights from Newark.

In June 2009, Continental Airlines took delivery of another new Boeing 737-900ER, which was painted with a retro livery to commemorate the airline&#x27;s 75th anniversary. The livery, which was originally used on aircraft beginning in 1947 and is called The Blue Skyway, was selected by Continental employees. Continental flew the aircraft to its three hubs for anniversary celebration events for employees and retirees. Post-merger, United maintained the livery, but on a different 737-900ER than the aircraft originally carrying it. In July 2009 Continental began to offer DirecTV, giving customers the choice of 95 channels of live television programming, more channels than any other carrier. Continental also launched Virtual Expert technology on their website at continental.com, offering customers 24-hour support on the Web for all their travel needs. Continental was the first airline to use this technology.

===2010s===
On January 1, 2010, Jeff Smisek, former president and COO, became the CEO of Continental Airlines.
Continental also planned to start seasonal nonstop service between Portland International Airport (PDX) and Ted Stevens International Airport (ANC), putting Continental in direct competition with former partner Alaska Airlines. The route was scheduled to start on June 10, 2010. On February 16, Continental, along with its wholly owned subsidiary Continental Micronesia, announced that it applied for nonstop flights to Tokyo-Haneda as part of an open-skies agreement between the US and Japan. Continental planned to begin services to Tokyo-Haneda from its New York/Newark hub in late October 2010, and Continental Micronesia planned to start service to Haneda Airport from its Guam hub. However, Haneda slots were awarded to American, Delta, and Hawaiian Airlines instead. Continental Airlines became the first airline to launch a mobile boarding pass service to London&#x27;s Heathrow. The service allowed customers to receive boarding passes electronically on their mobile phones or PDAs. Continental Airlines left the SkyTeam alliance on October 24, 2009, and joined Star Alliance on October 27, 2009.

====Merger with United Airlines====
In February 2008, UAL Corporation and Continental Airlines began the advanced stages of merger talks and were expected to announce their decision in the immediate aftermath of a definitive merger agreement between rival Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines. The timing of the events was notable because Northwest&#x27;s golden shares in Continental (that gave Northwest veto authority against any merger involving Continental) could be redeemed, freeing Continental to pursue a marriage with United. On April 27, 2008, Continental broke off merger negotiations with United and stated it was going to stand alone. Despite ending merger talks, Continental announced that it would join United in the Star Alliance.

United and US Airways were in advanced merger talks in late April 2008, following the announcement that Continental had broken off talks with United. In June 2008, the CEOs of both United and Continental signed an alliance pact that led to their eventual merger. The alliance was an agreement to link international networks and share technology and passenger perks. This agreement was termed a &quot;virtual merger&quot; as it included many of the benefits of a merger without the actual costs and restructuring involved. The alliance took effect about a year after Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines completed their merger, as that released Continental from the SkyTeam contract and allowed for the required nine-month notice. Additionally, Continental joined the Star Alliance, as Delta and Northwest merged.

United was reported to be in serious merger discussion with US Airways in early April 2010. A &quot;New York Times&quot; report indicated that a deal was close. Union consent was cited as a major hurdle for negotiators to clear. On April 22, 2010, United announced that it would not pursue a merger with US Airways.

On May 2, 2010, the boards of directors at Continental and United approved a stock-swap deal that would combine them into the world&#x27;s largest airline in revenue passenger miles. The new airline would take on United&#x27;s name, Continental&#x27;s logo and be based in United&#x27;s hometown of Chicago. The new United would be run by Continental&#x27;s CEO, Jeff Smisek, along with United&#x27;s CEO, Glenn Tilton, serving as non-executive chairman of the board. The deal received approval from US and European regulators in the summer of 2010. The shareholders of both airlines approved the deal on September 17, 2010. Both airlines had been reporting losses in the recession and expected the merger to generate savings of more than a year.

In August 2010, Continental and United revealed a new logo that was used after the merger was complete. Both carriers planned to begin merging operations in 2011 and were expected to receive a single operating certificate by 2012. Continental&#x27;s air operator&#x27;s certificate (AOC) was retained, while those of United and Continental Micronesia were surrendered. On the other hand, United&#x27;s maintenance certificate remained while Continental&#x27;s did not.

On October 1, 2010, UAL Corporation and Continental Airlines completed the planned merger and changed the name to United Continental Holdings. Although the two airlines remained separate until the operational integration was completed by mid-2012, as of that day both airlines were corporately controlled by the same leadership. On June 27, 2019, United changed its parent company name from United Continental Holdings to United Airlines Holdings. On December 22, 2010, Continental Airlines merged operating certificates with Continental Micronesia. All Continental Micronesia flights were then branded and operated by Continental Airlines. Both carriers began merging their operations in 2011. On March 22, UCH announced that they had plans to offer Wi-Fi Service on more than 200 domestic Boeing 737 and 757 aircraft. The airlines attained a single operating certificate from the FAA on November 30, 2011. That day, all Continental flights began to use the &quot;United&quot; callsign in air traffic control communications which marked the end of Continental Airlines.

The new United is the third largest airline in terms of fleet size, behind American Airlines and Delta. The combined airline houses a fleet of over 1,280 aircraft that features a mixture of Airbus and Boeing aircraft: Airbus A319s, Airbus A320s, Boeing 737s, Boeing 757s, Boeing 767s, Boeing 777s, and Boeing 787 Dreamliners with orders of Airbus A350s.

At the time of the merger with United, Continental was the fourth-largest airline in the US based on passenger-miles flown and the fifth largest in total passengers carried. Continental operated flights to destinations throughout the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific regions. Principal operations were from its four hubs at Newark Liberty International Airport, George Bush Intercontinental Airport (Houston), Cleveland Hopkins International Airport and Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport in Guam. The only Continental hubs to be rebranded are Cleveland Hopkins International Airport and Houston&#x27;s George Bush Intercontinental Airport. The Newark hub began the rebranding process on October 19, 2011, with all United-operated ticket counters and gates to be rebranded in Phase One; Phase Two of rebranding at Newark began in 2012 with Continental ticket counters and gates to be rebranded. On November 30, 2011, Continental officially merged with United and no longer operates as a separate airline.

On March 3, 2012, Continental&#x27;s passenger reservation system and frequent flyer program was merged into United. The last Continental Airlines flight taking off was &quot;Continental Flight 1267&quot;, flying from Phoenix to Cleveland, and arriving into the latter as &quot;United Flight 1267&quot;.

United Airlines, Inc. merged into Continental Airlines, Inc., with Continental Airlines, Inc. being the surviving corporate entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of the UAL Corporation, on March 31, 2013. The name of Continental Airlines, Inc., was changed to United Airlines, Inc.

==Corporate identity==

===Branding===
The designer Saul Bass designed the Continental &quot;Jet Stream&quot; logo in the late 1960s. In the 1990s, the design agency Lippincott introduced the globe logo. Before it merged, Continental&#x27;s livery consisted of a white fuselage, with the globe in blue and gold, and a gray underside. The combined United Airlines adopted the pre-merger Continental Airlines livery and logo following the merger.

==Company affairs==

===Headquarters===
On October 31, 1937, Continental moved its headquarters to Stapleton Airport in Denver, Colorado. Robert F. Six arranged to have the headquarters moved to Denver from El Paso, Texas, because Six believed that the airline should have its headquarters in a large city with a potential base of customers.
At a 1962 press conference in the office of Mayor of Los Angeles Sam Yorty, Continental Airlines announced that it planned to move its headquarters to Los Angeles in July 1963. In 1963 Continental&#x27;s headquarters moved to a two-story, $2.3 million building on the grounds of Los Angeles International Airport in Westchester, Los Angeles. The July 2009 &quot;Continental Magazine&quot; issue stated that the move &quot;underlined Continental&#x27;s western and Pacific orientation.&quot;

On July 1, 1983, the airline&#x27;s headquarters were relocated to the America Tower in the Neartown area of Houston, and would remain there until they ended up relocating in 1998. Stephen M. Wolf, the president of Continental said that the company moved its headquarters because Houston became the largest hub for Continental.

In January 1997, Continental occupied of space at the America Tower. In addition it had of office space in a building in proximity to George Bush Intercontinental Airport and in a building located on Fuqua Road in Houston. The airline planned to move into a new headquarters site; originally it wanted a single site for its operations. In September 1997, the airline officially announced that it would consolidate its Houston headquarters in Continental Center I. The airline scheduled to move around 3,200 employees in stages beginning in July 1998 and ending in January 1999. The airline consolidated the headquarters operation at the America Tower and three other local operations into Continental Center I and Continental Center II in the Cullen Center. Bob Lanier, Mayor of Houston, said that he was &quot;tickled to death&quot; by the airline&#x27;s move to relocate to Downtown Houston.

After the September 11 attacks and by September 2004 Continental laid off 24% of its clerical and management workers. Despite the reduction of the workforce, Continental did not announce any plans to sublease any of its space in Continental Center I and Continental Center II.

In 2008 Continental renewed its lease for around in Continental Center I. Before the lease renewal, rumors spread stating that the airline would relocate its headquarters to office space around George Bush Intercontinental Airport due to high fuel costs affecting the airline industry; the rumors stated that the airline was studying possibilities of less expensive alternatives to Continental Center I. The parties did not reveal the terms of the lease agreement.

In 2010, Continental Airlines and United Airlines announced that they would merge and that the headquarters of the combined company would be in the Chicago Loop in Chicago. The airline has not stated how much of the of space that it leases in Continental Center I will be vacated. As of 2010 Continental had around 3,000 clerical and management workers in its Downtown Houston offices. According to Nicole Bradford of the &quot;Houston Business Journal&quot;, some believe that the airline will vacate and leave thousands of square feet of space in Downtown Houston empty. As of 2010 Continental leases in Continental Center I, about 40% of the tower&#x27;s office space. United has begun to move employees to a new operations center in the Willis Tower (former Sears Tower) and one thousand are expected by the end of 2010. As of September 2011 Continental continues to have employees at Continental Center I, which is now a former headquarters. About half of the existing employee base will remain in the building. As of September 2011 Continental continues to occupy space at Continental Center I, now a former headquarters, and another building. Half of the previous number of employees will work in Downtown Houston. Some job positions were eliminated. Some employees were transferred to Chicago.

===Environmental record===
Continental Airlines made efforts to minimize the negative environmental effects of commercial aviation. For example, the carrier invested over $12 billion for the purchase of 270 fuel-efficient aircraft and related equipment that made up part of the airline&#x27;s fleet. These efforts contributed to significant reductions of greenhouse gas and noise emissions. Continental Airlines was also one of the first carriers in the world to fit winglets to as much of its fleet as it could, reducing fuel burn by 3–5%.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s &quot;Design for the Environment&quot; program recognized Continental in 2008 for use of a non-chromium aircraft surface pre-treatment that is environmentally compatible. Continental Airlines was the first carrier in the world to utilize this technology on their aircraft. The product, &quot;PreKote&quot;, eliminates hazardous chemicals that are usually used in the pre-treatment phase before painting an aircraft. This technology provides improved environmental conditions for maintenance employees, while also reducing wastewater.

Continental Airlines conducted flight tests using aircraft powered by biofuel rather than traditional Jet-A1. On January 7, 2009, Continental partnered with GE Aviation to conduct a biofuel demonstration flight, making the airline the first U.S. carrier to conduct tests using biofuels. The test bed, a Boeing 737-800 (registered as N76516), ran one of its engines on a mix of 50% kerosene, 6% algae oil, and 44% oil from jatropha, a weed that bears oil producing seeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-biofuel8-2009jan08,0,761065.story&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The engine running partly on biofuel burned less fuel than the conventional engine in hours while producing more thrust using the same volume of fuel. Continental&#x27;s CEO, Larry Kellner, commented &quot;This is a good step forward, an opportunity to really make a difference to the environment&quot; citing jatropha&#x27;s 50–60% lower CO2 emissions as opposed to Jet-A1 in its lifecycle.

Continental Airlines was recognized by NASA and &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine for positive environmental contributions.

==Destinations==
Continental, together with Continental Express and Continental Connection, offered more than 2,400 daily departures throughout the Americas, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. The summer 2008 schedule saw Continental serving 130 domestic and 132 international destinations.

Continental Airlines operated primarily a hub-and-spoke route network with North American hubs in Cleveland, Houston, and Newark, and a west Pacific hub in Guam. The majority of Continental flights were operated from its hubs. Some affiliated airlines used the Continental Connection name also operate flights not involving hubs, such as Gulfstream International Airlines, which operated intra-Florida and Florida-Bahamas services.

For almost 40 years, Continental operated a very large hub in Denver, Colorado, but took the decision to close that hub in 1995 immediately after the opening of Denver International Airport (DIA), which represented a significantly higher-cost operation than the former Stapleton Airport, which DIA had replaced. The abrupt nature of this change came as a shock to Denver, which was experiencing dramatic growth. The void left by Continental&#x27;s departure allowed the establishment of the &quot;new&quot; Frontier Airlines (a startup, rather than the original carrier of that name). Both Frontier and Southwest Airlines (which entered the Denver market after Continental&#x27;s dehubbing) expanded quickly to fill the vacuum created by Continental&#x27;s closing of its Denver hub.

For the first forty years of its existence, Continental was a domestic airline; however, especially after the incorporation of Texas International routes, it served more Mexican destinations than any other U.S. carrier since the mid-1980s.

Continental first entered the transatlantic market in April 1985, with the introduction of a Houston-London-Gatwick service. Long prevented from serving London Heathrow Airport because of the provisions of the Bermuda II agreement, which only allowed British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, United Airlines and American Airlines to operate flights from Heathrow to the United States, Continental maintained its London services at Gatwick, where in 2007 as many as six flights a day were offered to Newark, Houston, and Cleveland.

In March 2008, an Open Skies Agreement between the U.S. and the European Union became effective, invalidating Bermuda II restrictions that had limited the number of carriers and cities in the U.S. that could serve London-Heathrow. In November 2007 Continental announced that new, nonstop, twice-daily service from its hubs at George Bush Intercontinental Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport to London-Heathrow would be offered; and this service was inaugurated on March 29, 2008. The service replaced existing frequencies to London-Gatwick and were offered with a combination of Boeing 777-200ER and 757-200 equipment, with flat beds guaranteed in the BusinessFirst cabin. By the time of its merger with United, Continental had grown its presence at London-Heathrow to seven daily flights; two to Houston-Intercontinental and five to Newark.

During the Vietnam War, Continental&#x27;s extensive military charter operations established a presence in the Pacific region that formed the basis for the Air Micronesia operation. Service to Japan was initiated in the 1970s from Guam and Saipan, and by the late 1980s, nonstop service between Seattle and Tokyo was briefly offered with 747 equipment, soon to be replaced with a direct Honolulu-Tokyo (Narita) flight. Through the 1990s, Continental maintained a minimal presence in the long-haul trans-Pacific market, until the delivery of 777-200ERs in 1998 which saw the addition of nonstop Tokyo service from Houston and Newark. By 2007, Hong Kong and Beijing were added to the network, and in 2009 Shanghai was added, all from the Newark hub. Continental has served Australia in the past with DC-10 and Boeing 747 service from Hawaii, with some flights via Auckland. Continental withdrew from much of the Australasian market, but continues Air Micronesia Boeing 737-800 services between Cairns and Guam on a 4x weekly basis. Beginning in June 2011, it initiated service to Hilo, Hawaii, providing that city the only nonstop air service to and from any destination outside the state of Hawaii.

Continental offered the most destinations of any of the U.S. carriers to Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom, and was the only U.S. airline that flew to the Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, and Norway. Continental began service from Newark to Mumbai, India on October 1, 2007, making that city Continental&#x27;s second Indian destination.

===Codeshare agreements===
Throughout its existence, Continental Airlines had codeshare agreements with the following airlines:
* Aeromar
* Air France 
* Alitalia 
* America West Airlines 
* Amtrak 
* Avianca
* Cape Air
* Copa Airlines
* Copa Airlines Colombia
* Czech Airlines 
* Delta Air Lines 
* EVA Air
* Hawaiian Airlines
* Island Air
* KLM 
* Korean Air 
* Northwest Airlines 
* Spanair 
* TACA Airlines
* United Airlines 
* US Airways
===Regional operators===

Continental was a minority owner of ExpressJet, which operated under the &quot;Continental Express&quot; trade name but was a separately managed and public company. Chautauqua Airlines also flew under the Continental Express identity, while Cape Air, Colgan Air, CommutAir, and Silver Airways fed Continental&#x27;s flights under the Continental Connection identity. Continental did not have any ownership interests in these companies.

The operators of Continental Connection were:
* Cape Air operated out of San Juan (SJU), Puerto Rico, to other Puerto Rican destinations, the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, Anguilla and Nevis. It also serviced routes from Guam to Saipan, Saipan to Rota and Rota to Guam.
* Colgan Air operated out of Cleveland, Houston and Newark as a subsidiary of Pinnacle Airlines Corp.
* CommutAir operated mostly from Continental&#x27;s Cleveland and Newark hubs.
* Gulfstream International Airlines operated in the Bahamas, Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, Orlando, Tampa, West Palm Beach, Tallahassee, Pensacola, and Key West. Also operated some flights under the Essential Air Service program from Continental&#x27;s Cleveland hub.
* Silver Airways

==Fleet==
Continental&#x27;s all-Boeing fleet consisted of four types (737, 757, 767, and 777) in ten variants, with two variants of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner scheduled to enter service in 2011. The company&#x27;s daily aircraft utilization was usually at the top of the industry.

As of October 1, 2010, at the time of the merger, the Continental Airlines fleet consisted of the following aircraft with an average age of 9.5 years:

By 2013, all of the former Continental fleet, excluding the Boeing 737-500 and Boeing 767-200ER (which were sold, primarily to Russian operators) were repainted in the new United livery making them officially part of the United Airlines Fleet, except for the one Boeing 737-900ER in the Continental Blue Skyway retro livery (N75436). United repainted this aircraft to the standard Globe livery in May 2016, and then painted a different airframe in the Blue Skyway, sister ship N75435. The reason for the change is currently unknown to the public.

First Class was offered on Domestic Flights, and BusinessFirst was offered on Transatlantic/Transpacific Flights.

Continental Airlines was one of three carriers (with American Airlines and Delta Air Lines) to sign an exclusivity agreement with Boeing in the late 1990s. When Boeing acquired McDonnell Douglas, the European Union forced Boeing to void the contracts. Both parties had been adhering to the terms under a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement.

Continental was one of the first major airlines to fly Boeing 757s on transatlantic routes. There have been some instances of range limitations on west-bound transatlantic flights due to strong headwinds resulting in a fuel stop which does not appear on the timetable, but these stops are not common. The use of the 757 with its smaller seating capacity allowed for &quot;thin&quot; routes (routes with less passenger traffic) to be economically viable. It allowed nonstop service from smaller cities, such as Belfast, Northern Ireland and Hamburg, Germany to the New York gateway. Previously, customers originating at these and similar cities needed to connect at European gateways like London Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle, or Frankfurt, in order to travel to New York. United retains a number of these flight routes, mostly based out of Newark, including Newark-Dublin and Newark-Berlin.

===Historic fleet===
Over the years, Continental Airlines had in the past operated a variety of the following aircraft:

===Fleet in 1960, 1970, and 1980===



===Cabin===
Continental Airlines had two classes of service, First/Business and Economy, for aircraft in the mainline fleet.

====BusinessFirst====
BusinessFirst was Continental&#x27;s international business class product. It was offered on all Boeing 757-200s, Boeing 767s, and Boeing 777-200ERs. Continental had begun deploying BusinessFirst seats that allowed customers to lie completely flat, reclining 180-degrees and providing of sleeping space in the fully extended position on its 777-200ER and 757-200 aircraft. The Flat Bed Seat offered a seat measuring up to wide when the adjustable armrest was positioned flush with the seat cushion. Electronic controls enabled customers to easily move the seats to an infinite combination of seat adjustments, including lumbar support, leg and foot rests. iPod connectivity was available in the Flat Bed Seat. The new BusinessFirst seats had a six-way adjustable head rest, an individual overhead reading light and an adjustable seat light allowing customers to read in bed without disturbing their neighbor and a privacy shell that allowed for seclusion from other travelers. BusinessFirst customers also received one of the highest crew to passenger ratios (1:8) among all international business class products.
The new BusinessFirst seats were featured on all of Continental&#x27;s 777-200ERs and 757-200s. Installation on the Boeing 767 fleet was to follow in 2011. The anticipated completion of the roll-out across Continental&#x27;s entire international fleet was planned for August 2012. In addition, all 787 deliveries were to have the seats installed.

Continental considered BusinessFirst to be its signature onboard product, and the service is a frequent subject of advertising campaigns. Customers seated in the BusinessFirst cabin on longhaul flights from the United States to Europe, Asia, select cities in South America, and the Middle East received special ground services, including EliteAccess priority bag service at check-in, expedited security screening (where available), access to Continental&#x27;s Presidents Club or affiliated Star Alliance lounges, personalized Continental Concierge service, and dedicated boarding procedures.

On board, multi-course meals were designed by Continental&#x27;s Congress of Chefs, beverages were selected by Continental&#x27;s Wine Masters, and service was provided by flight attendants from separate International crew bases at Newark and Houston. Most flights had at least two meal services. Entertainment was offered at each individual seat, and passengers on Boeing 777 and 757 aircraft had access to a new Audio-Video On Demand system with touch-screen controls. 767 aircraft featured older, looped-video multi-channel entertainment systems, generally with a wider programming selection than Economy Class. 767 aircraft were expected to receive AVOD in the near future. Customers also were provided headphones, a large pillow, wool blanket, and amenity kit prior to departure. Upon arrival, BusinessFirst customers have access to shower facilities and arrival lounges at most airports.

Continental offered a modified BusinessFirst service on flights from the United States mainland to Hawaii. All flights offered the same suite of EliteAccess ground services, along with a similar main meal service on board. Amenities such as pillows and headsets also were the same, but no amenity kits were offered. On flights from Newark and Houston to Honolulu, Continental operated Boeing 767-400ER aircraft with typical recliner-style BusinessFirst seats. On flights from Los Angeles and Orange County to Honolulu/Kahului with Boeing 737 equipment, domestic First Class seats were substituted. Nonstop flights from Guam to Honolulu were exempt from most of these modifications and more closely resembled the standard BusinessFirst service.

No complimentary upgrades were offered to Continental OnePass Elite members on any intercontinental flights offering BusinessFirst service. However, on 767-operated BusinessFirst services to Hawaii, Continental offered a day-of-departure buy up fee for any revenue coach class fare, provided seats were available. Mainland-Hawaii was the only BusinessFirst market where such upgrades are available. In addition, OnePass Elites were eligible for complimentary automatic upgrades on Continental-operated flights from California to Hawaii.
====Domestic First Class====
First Class was offered on all domestically configured aircraft. It was offered on all Boeing 737s and Boeing 757-300s. Seats range from 20.75 to wide, and had between 37 and of pitch. Passengers aboard this class received free meals, refreshments, and alcoholic beverages. Passengers could watch movies on overhead television screens located throughout the cabin. In 2009, Continental began to add LiveTV television and Wi-Fi services to all next-generation Boeing 737s and Boeing 757-300s which was free of charge to First Class customers.

On international flights to Latin America, the Caribbean, and select cities in South America, Continental&#x27;s Domestic First Class service was re-branded as Regional Business Class. These customers received access to Continental&#x27;s Presidents Club and affiliated Star Alliance lounges on day-of-departure. Also, meal choices were frequently substituted to reflect the local cuisine of destinations served, especially on flights to Latin America.

====International Economy Class====
Economy Class was offered on all internationally configured aircraft. Seats range from 17.2 to wide, and have between 31 and of pitch. Passengers aboard this class received free meals, snacks, and non-alcoholic beverages; alcoholic beverages could be purchased for US$6 per drink or one Continental Currency coupon per drink. All seats on 757 and 777 equipment were fitted with AVOD touch screen with a wide-ranging selection of films, games, television shows and music.

====Domestic Economy Class====
Economy Class was offered on all domestically configured aircraft. Seats were wide, and had between 31 and of pitch. Passengers aboard this class received free non-alcoholic refreshments. Alcoholic beverages could be purchased on board. Passengers on all Boeing 737-700, −800, −900, −900ER, and 757-300 aircraft could watch movies on overhead television screens located throughout the cabin, with headsets available at a charge. In January 2009, Continental began to add LiveTV television services to all next-generation Boeing 737s and Boeing 757-300s. LiveTV would be chargeable for Economy Class customers. Continental Airlines offered free meals on domestic economy class flights. In March 2010, for economy class passengers on domestic and Canadian flights under six hours and on certain flights to and from Latin America, the airline discontinued free meals and began buy on board service in the northern hemisphere in the fall of 2010.

===Meal and drink services===
Meals were free on BusinessFirst on all flights. Flights of a duration of over one hour within North America and flights to and from resort destinations in the Caribbean and Latin America had meals in First Class depending on the mealtimes that the flights are within. All flights to and from non-resort destinations in the Caribbean and Latin America had free meals in First Class, with the exception of certain flights that depart after midnight. Meals in Economy Class were served on most flights to and from Asia and Europe. Meals were offered in economy class on all flights to and from non-resort destinations in the Caribbean Latin America, with the exception of some flights departing after midnight. Flights within Asia and the Pacific that were previously operated by Continental Micronesia had free meals and/or snacks offered during mealtimes. Meals were available for purchase on all economy class flights within North America, to/from Canada, and to/from resort destinations within the Caribbean and Latin America if the flight&#x27;s duration was over 6 hours.

Towards the end of the airline&#x27;s life, on most economy class flights within North America, to/from Canada, and to/from resort destinations within the Caribbean and Latin America, Continental had a buy on board service. On those flights between 2 hours and 6 hours, snacks were available for purchase, and food for purchase was available on most of those flights that are 3 to 6 hours. Originally the airline provided meals free of charge on flights more than 1 hours. The airline continued doing so after competitors charged for meals. In March 2010 the airline announced that it would switch to buy on board for food in fall 2010. The airline said that the absence of free meals would save the airline $35 million per year ($ when adjusted for inflation), and if half of economy class passengers on the affected flights purchased food, the airline would make an additional $17 million per year ($ when adjusted for inflation). The airline did not say how the transition to buy on board would affect the employment of workers at the subsidiary Chelsea Food Services. Buy on board began on October 12, 2010. On March 1, 2011, Continental stopped serving free snacks on domestic flights to coach passengers in order to align itself with the policy of United Airlines. In addition, on that day all fights between Hawaii, Alaska, and the Mainland U.S. became buy on board flights.

Continental Airlines offered free special meal options on certain flights; special meals include the Child, Gluten intolerant, Hindu vegetarian, Jain, Kosher, Muslim, and Vegan options. The airline offered special meals for all classes of service on flights to and between Houston and Argentina, Asia, Brazil, Europe, and Hawaii, and the airline offered special meals for all classes of service on flights between Newark and Asia, Brazil, Europe, and Hawaii; flights between Newark and India use Hindu vegetarian as a standard meal choice. In addition, special meals were available in first class on flights between Newark and Alaska, California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. Other routes with special meal service available in first class include Los Angeles to/from Honolulu, Los Angeles to/from Maui, Orange County to/from Honolulu, and Orange County to/from Maui.

The airline offered soft drinks that are free on all flights. Beer, liqueurs, spirits, and wine were free of charge in BusinessFirst and Business Class on all flights, and for a charge in economy class on all flights. On flights within North America and to or from the Caribbean and Latin America, the airline offered &quot;Specialty Beverages&quot; for purchase in economy class.

===In-flight entertainment===

Boeing 757-200 and 777-200ER aircraft included Audio-Video On-Demand (AVOD) in every seat back. Boeing 767 family aircraft were equipped with a personal television located in every seat back, using a tape system. On all Boeing 757-200 and Boeing 777-200ER aircraft, all rows were equipped with power-ports (two power ports per group of 3 seats) that do not require special power adapters or cables.
Continental Airlines began offering 95 channels of live DirecTV television to all passengers on its domestic fleet beginning in January 2009. Boeing 737-700s, 800s, 900s, and 900ERs and Boeing 757-300s were going to receive the service. The service became available immediately after a credit card is swiped and confirmed, and could be activated at any point during the flight. Movies started at a set time and cannot be paused, rewound or fast-forwarded. The service was free to first-class passengers and was available for a charge of US$6 in the coach cabin. Service could become limited and/or interrupted during descent.

On December 16, 2009, Continental Airlines, announced that, beginning in the second quarter 2010(see note) it will offer Gogo Inflight Internet service on its fleet of 21 Boeing 757-300 aircraft that primarily serve domestic routes. The new Gogo Inflight Internet service will provide customers full Internet access on their own standard, Wi-Fi equipped laptop or Personal Electronic Device (PED) at speeds similar to wireless mobile broadband services on the ground. Customers will be able to sign up and log in once the aircraft reaches . The Gogo system, powered by the Aircell Network and available in the continental U.S., will be available to customers at a cost from $4.95 and up, based on length of flight.

At airport kiosks Continental Airlines allowed customers to buy &quot;Continental Currency&quot;, a prepaid credit for audio headsets and alcoholic beverages on flights.

==OnePass==
Established in 1987 in cooperation with now defunct Eastern Air Lines, OnePass was the frequent flyer program for Continental Airlines, the Trump Shuttle, Copa Airlines and Copa Airlines Colombia. OnePass offered regular travelers the privilege to obtain free tickets, First Class upgrades on flights, discounted membership for its airport lounge (President&#x27;s Club), and other types of rewards. Customers accumulated miles from flight segments they fly or through Continental Airlines partners. OnePass elite tiers were Silver, Gold, and Platinum Elite which have benefits such as free upgrades, mileage bonus, priority check-in, priority boarding, and much more. Continental previously had a frequent flyer program prior to OnePass called TravelBank, which was started not long after American Airlines started its frequent flyer program in 1981 and when most large United States airlines followed, but this was merged with Eastern Airlines&#x27; frequent flyer program in 1987 to form OnePass. The name &quot;OnePass&quot; refers to the ability to accumulate miles on two major airlines, namely Continental and Eastern, in one frequent flyer program.

In addition to its Continental Express, Continental Connection and Star Alliance partnerships, Continental had frequent flyer partnerships with the following airlines (as of February 2012):
* Aeromar
* Cape Air
* Copa Airlines
* EVA Air
* Hawaiian Airlines
* Island Air

As a result of United Airlines and Continental Airlines merger, on March 3, 2012, OnePass program was phased out and merged into United MileagePlus program. OnePass stopped accepting new membership applications effective February 29, 2012.

The President&#x27;s Club was the membership airport lounge program of Continental Airlines.

==Accidents and incidents==
The following were major accidents and incidents that have occurred on Continental Airlines mainline aircraft.

* August 27, 1945
** A Lockheed Lodestar burned out while parked at Albuquerque, New Mexico; there was no one on board.
* March 16, 1954
** Flight 46, on a flight from Midland, Texas, to Kansas City, Missouri, suffered vibration just after takeoff and went into a dive; the flight crew managed to make a wheels-up landing in an open field.
* May 22, 1962
** Thomas Doty, a passenger intent on having his wife claim money from life insurance, boarded Flight 11 with a bomb, which departed Chicago-O’Hare, destined for Kansas City Municipal Airport. The bomb exploded, breaking off the aircraft&#x27;s tail, and the plane crashed on a farm near Unionville, Missouri. All 45 on board died, including the suicide bomber. This aircraft had previously been subject to an attempted hijacking to Cuba, although the hijackers were captured in El Paso, Texas.
* July 8, 1962
** A Vickers Viscount was damaged beyond economic repair when the propellers struck the runway shortly after take-off. A wheels-up landing was made in a wheat field.
* January 29, 1963
** Flight 290, en route from Midland, Texas, to Kansas City, crashed on approach near the south end of the runway and burst into flames.
* August 4, 1971
** Continental Airlines Flight 712, on a flight coming from Hilo International Airport into Los Angeles International Airport collided in midair over Compton with a Cessna 150 at about 3,950 feet during an evening approach to LAX. The Boeing suffered substantial damage to the outer right-wing panel but landed safely. The Cessna 150 crashed and was destroyed but both occupants survived with injuries.
* April 13, 1973
** After bringing Bob and Audrey Six to their Colorado ranch, the Sabreliner crew departed Montrose Regional Airport, for the return flight to Los Angeles (LAX). The thrust reverser of the aircraft was deployed in flight shortly after takeoff. The aircraft descended from , struck the ground, and was destroyed.
* August 7, 1975
** Flight 426, bound for Wichita, Kansas, crashed near the departure end of runway shortly after takeoff from Denver-Stapleton International Airport. The aircraft encountered severe windshear at an altitude and airspeed which precluded recovery to level flight. The aircraft descended at a rate which could not be overcome even though the aircraft was flown at or near its maximum lift capability throughout the encounter. The windshear was generated by the outflow from a thunderstorm which was over the aircraft&#x27;s departure path. All passengers and crew were safely evacuated. The aircraft, a Boeing 727, was a total loss.
* March 1, 1978
** Flight 603 was scheduled to Honolulu, HI from Los Angeles. At takeoff, the McDonnell-Douglas DC-10 overran the runway at Los Angeles (LAX) when the takeoff was aborted as a result of a tire explosion. The resulting overrun caused a fire that engulfed the aircraft. The aircraft was a total loss; two passengers died when they evacuated the aircraft directly into the fire. Two other passengers died three months later of their injuries.
* July 8, 1987
** A Continental Boeing 747 had a near collision with an off-course Delta Air Lines Lockheed L-1011. Both the Delta (London-Cincinnati) and Continental (London-Newark) were heading to the U.S., with a total of nearly 600 people on board. The Delta flight strayed off course during its flight, and came within of colliding with the 747 as the L-1011 flew under it in Canadian airspace. It was potentially the deadliest aviation accident in history. Delta pilots attempted to convince the Continental crew to cover up the incident and not report it.
* November 15, 1987
** Flight 1713, bound for Boise, Idaho, crashed on take-off during a snowstorm at Stapleton International Airport, Denver, Colorado. 25 passengers and 3 crew were killed.
* March 2, 1994
** Flight 795, a McDonnell Douglas MD-82, suffered damage due to a rejected takeoff from runway 13 at LaGuardia Airport during wintry conditions. The aircraft failed to takeoff and came to a stop at the edge of a ditch near the runway. 30 Passengers and crew suffered minor injuries.
* February 19, 1996
** Flight 1943 landed wheels up on runway 27 at the Houston Intercontinental Airport, Houston, Texas.
* September 16, 1998
** Flight 475 from Houston to Guadalajara, a Boeing 737-500, was damaged beyond repair upon exiting the left side of the runway while landing. There were no injuries, and wind shear is suspected to have been a factor.
* July 25, 2000
** The official investigation found that Flight 55 (a Continental DC-10) caused the crash of Air France Concorde Flight 4590 in Paris. The DC-10 dropped a strip of titanium alloy from its thrust reverser on the runway during takeoff. When AF4590 subsequently departed, Concorde&#x27;s left main landing gear tires struck the strip of metal and were punctured. The tires then exploded and tire rubber fragments penetrated Concorde&#x27;s wing fuel tanks, starting fires in engines 1 and 2, leading to the crash which killed all aboard and four people on the ground. According to the official report on the accident, the strip of metal installed on the Continental jet was made from a different alloy than had been approved by the US Federal Aviation Administration or the engine manufacturer. This led French authorities to undertake a criminal investigation into Continental Airlines, which ended in Continental being fined 200,000 euros and ordered to pay 1 million euros to Air France.
* January 16, 2006
** A mechanic standing near a Boeing 737 at El Paso International Airport in Texas was sucked into one of the engines and killed. The mechanic&#x27;s failure to maintain proper clearance with the engine intake during a jet engine run, and the failure of contract maintenance personnel to follow written procedures and directives contained in the airline&#x27;s general maintenance manual were determined to be the cause. Factors contributing to the accident were the insufficient training provided to the contract mechanics by the airline, and the failure of the airport to disseminate a policy prohibiting ground engine runs above idle power in the terminal area.
* December 20, 2008
** Flight 1404 bound for Houston, pulled left and ran off of the runway during its takeoff roll at Denver International Airport. The cause of the incident is unknown, however the right side of aircraft caught fire once coming to a stop. Of the 115 people on board, 47 sustained injuries, with 2 seriously injured, including the pilot.

===Incidents===

* July 1, 1965
** Continental Airlines Flight 12, a Boeing 707-100, ran off the runway at Kansas City Downtown Airport landing in heavy rain. All 66 on board survived however the aircraft broke apart in several places and was a total loss.
* March 1, 1978
**Continental Airlines Flight 603 was a scheduled McDonnell Douglas DC-10 flight between Los Angeles International Airport and Honolulu International Airport. On March 1, 1978, it crashed during an aborted takeoff, resulting in the deaths of four passengers.
*October 28, 2006
** Continental Flight 1883, a Boeing 757-200 aircraft carrying 160 passengers, landed on a narrow unoccupied taxiway parallel to runway 29 at Newark Liberty International Airport. No one was injured and both pilots were removed from flying status duties pending an investigation. They have since been reinstated. Potentially confusing runway lighting and pilot error were cited in the investigation.
* In January 2007
** A Continental Boeing 757 pilot died en route from Houston to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. The flight was diverted to McAllen, Texas.
* In November 2008
** The airline temporarily cancelled it&#x27;s flights to Mumbai Airport due to passenger and crew safety during the terrorist attacks in Mumbai led by 10 Pakistan based Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists. Continental resumed it&#x27;s flights once the attacks ended after the last attacker was killed by security forces.
* June 18, 2009
** The captain of Continental Airlines Flight 61, a Boeing 777-200ER, en route from Brussels, Belgium, to Newark, New Jersey, died of natural causes during the trip. The airline alerted federal authorities around 10:30 that morning that Flight 61 was being flown by the first officer and relief pilot. The plane with 247 passengers aboard landed safely at Newark Liberty International Airport at about noon EDT.
* August 3, 2009
** Continental Airlines Flight 128, a Boeing 767, made an emergency landing in Miami (Miami International Airport) due to extreme turbulence. This flight was scheduled from Rio de Janeiro (Rio de Janeiro-Galeão International Airport) to Houston (George Bush Intercontinental Airport). The plane carried 11 crew members and 168 passengers. At least 26 passengers were injured, including four seriously.
* December 6, 2010
** Continental Airlines was found criminally responsible for the disaster to Concorde (Air France Flight 4590) at Gonesse on July 25, 2000 (an accident that killed one hundred passengers and nine crew members on board the plane, and four persons on the ground) by a Parisian court and was fined €200,000 ($271,628) and ordered to pay Air France €1 million. Continental mechanic John Taylor was given a 15-month suspended sentence, while another airline operative and three French officials were cleared of all charges. The court ruled that the crash resulted from a piece of metal from a Continental jet that was left on the runway; the object punctured a tire on the Concorde and then ruptured a fuel tank. Another Continental employee, Stanley Ford, was found not guilty. On November 29, 2012, a French appeals court overturned that decision, thereby clearing Continental of criminal responsibility.

<text>Barbara Wertheim Tuchman (; January 30, 1912 – February 6, 1989) was an American historian, journalist and author. She won the Pulitzer Prize twice, for &quot;The Guns of August&quot; (1962), a best-selling history of the prelude to and the first month of World War I, and &quot;Stilwell and the American Experience in China&quot; (1971), a biography of General Joseph Stilwell.

Tuchman focused on writing popular history.

==Early years==
Barbara Wertheim was born January 30, 1912, the daughter of the banker Maurice Wertheim and his first wife Alma Morgenthau. Her father was an individual of wealth and prestige, the owner of &quot;The Nation&quot; magazine, president of the American Jewish Committee, prominent art collector, and a founder of the Theatre Guild. Her mother was the daughter of Henry Morgenthau, Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s ambassador to the Ottoman Empire.

While she did not explicitly mention it in her 1962 book &quot;The Guns of August&quot;, Tuchman was present for one of the pivotal events of the book: the pursuit of the German battle cruiser &quot;Goeben&quot; and light cruiser &quot;Breslau&quot;. In her account of the pursuit she wrote, &quot;That morning [August 10, 1914] there arrived in Constantinople the small Italian passenger steamer which had witnessed the &quot;Gloucester&quot;″s action against &quot;Goeben&quot; and &quot;Breslau&quot;. Among its passengers were the daughter, son-in-law and three grandchildren of the American ambassador Mr. Henry Morgenthau.&quot; She was a grandchild of Henry Morgenthau; she is referring to herself. This is confirmed in her later book &quot;Practicing History&quot;, in which she tells the story of her father, Maurice Wertheim, traveling from Constantinople to Jerusalem on August 29, 1914, to deliver funds to the Jewish community there. Thus, at two, Tuchman was present during the pursuit of &quot;Goeben&quot; and &quot;Breslau&quot;, which she documented 48 years later.

Wertheim was influenced at an early age by the books of Lucy Fitch Perkins and G. A. Henty, as well as the historical novels of Alexandre Dumas. She attended the Walden School on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side. She received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Radcliffe College in 1933, having studied history and literature.

==Researcher and journalist==

Following graduation, Wertheim worked as a volunteer research assistant at the Institute of Pacific Relations in New York, spending a year in Tokyo in 1934–35, including a month in China, then returning to the United States via the Trans-Siberian Railway to Moscow and on to Paris. She also contributed to &quot;The Nation&quot; as a correspondent until her father&#x27;s sale of the publication in 1937, traveling to Valencia and Madrid to cover the Spanish Civil War. 

In 1940, Wertheim married Lester R. Tuchman (1904–1997), an internist, medical researcher and professor of clinical medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan. They had three daughters, including Jessica Mathews, who became president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

During the years of World War II, Tuchman worked in the Office of War Information. Following the war, Tuchman spent the next decade working to raise the children while doing basic research for what would ultimately become the 1956 book &quot;Bible and Sword: England and Palestine from the Bronze Age to Balfour.&quot;

==Historian==
With the publication of &quot;Bible and Sword&quot; in 1956, Tuchman dedicated herself to historical research and writing, turning out a new book approximately every four years. Rather than feeling hampered by the lack of an advanced degree in history, Tuchman argued that freedom from the rigors and expectations of academia was actually liberating. She said that the norms of academic writing would have &quot;stifled any writing capacity.&quot;

Tuchman favored a literary approach to the writing of history, providing eloquent explanatory narratives rather than concentration upon discovery and publication of fresh archival sources. In the words of one biographer, Tuchman was &quot;not a historian&#x27;s historian; she was a layperson&#x27;s historian who made the past interesting to millions of readers&quot;.

In 1971, Tuchman received the St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates.

In 1978, Tuchman was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She became the first female president of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1979. She won a U.S. National Book Award in History for the first paperback edition of &quot;A Distant Mirror&quot; in 1980. Also in 1980 Tuchman gave the National Endowment for the Humanities&#x27; (NEH) Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. federal government&#x27;s highest honor for achievement in the humanities. Tuchman&#x27;s lecture was titled &quot;Mankind&#x27;s Better Moments&quot;.

Tuchman was a trustee of Radcliffe College and a lecturer at Harvard University, the University of California, and the Naval War College. Although she never received a graduate degree in history, Tuchman was the recipient of a number of honorary degrees from leading American universities, including Yale University, Harvard University, New York University, Columbia University, Boston University, and Smith College, among others.

==Death and legacy==
Tuchman died in 1989 in Greenwich, Connecticut, following a stroke, exactly one week after her 77th birthday.

A tower of Currier House, a residential division first of Radcliffe College and now of Harvard College, was named in Tuchman&#x27;s honor.

==Tuchman&#x27;s Law==

In the introduction to her 1978 book &quot;A Distant Mirror&quot;, Tuchman playfully identified a historical phenomenon which she termed &quot;Tuchman&#x27;s Law&quot;, to wit:

Tuchman&#x27;s Law has been defined as a psychological principle of &quot;perceptual readiness&quot; or &quot;subjective probability&quot; and one that is a useful guide in how to align with our subjective misunderstanding of the world&#x27;s dangers fueled by television and other media where random but rare acts of violence seem more prevalent than the much higher rates of violence and harm that stem, for example, from white collar crime and corporate decisions.
