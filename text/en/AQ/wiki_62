<text>Galena is the largest city in and the county seat of Jo Daviess County, Illinois, United States. It had a population of 3,308 at the 2020 census. A section of the city is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Galena Historic District. The city is named for the mineral galena, which was in the ore that formed the basis for the region&#x27;s early lead mining economy.

Native Americans, primarily Meskwaki, Ho-Chunk, Sauk, and Menominee had mined galena in the area for more than a thousand years before European Americans settled in the area. Owing to these deposits, Galena was the site of the first major mineral rush in the United States. By 1828, the population was estimated at 10,000, rivaling the population of Chicago at the time. Galena developed as the largest steamboat hub on the Mississippi River north of St. Louis. Galena was the home of Ulysses S. Grant and eight other Civil War generals. Today, the city is a tourist destination known for its history, architecture, and resorts.

==History==
===Precolonial and colonial history===

The city is named for galena, the natural form of lead sulfide (PbS) and the most important lead ore. Native Americans mined the ore for use in burial rituals. The Havana Hopewell first traded galena in the area during the Middle Woodland period (c. 1–400 CE). However, the use of galena in the Havana territory is uncertain; very little has been identified in burial mounds. During the Mississippian period (900–1500 CE), galena saw use as body paint.

In 1658 French explorers, probably via contact with the Sioux, first noted lead deposits in the Upper Mississippi Valley. A 1703 French map identified the northwestern Illinois area as &quot;mines de plumb&quot;. Northwestern Illinois was inhabited by the Sauk and Meskwaki when the French arrived. In the 1690s, French trappers discovered the area and began mining the lead. However, conflicts with the Sioux prevented large-scale mining until Julien Dubuque&#x27;s Mines opened across the river in 1788.

The French named the settlement as &quot;La Pointe&quot;, and early American settlers adopted this name as &quot;The Point&quot; after the United States acquired the territory in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. Early documentation officially records the name as &quot;Fever River&quot; for the wild beans that grew there, an early name for the Galena River.

This name did not appear to be widely used. George Davenport, a retired colonel in the United States Army, successfully shipped Galena&#x27;s first boatload of lead ore in 1816 down the Mississippi River. Three years later, Jesse W. Shull built a trading post. The Thomas H. January family, who arrived in 1821 from Maysville, Kentucky, are considered the first permanent American settlers. The next year, the US Department of War assumed control of the mines and leased the lands out to operators. A large group of colonists led by Dr. Moses Meeker and James Harris arrived in 1823. Steamboat trade began in 1824.

===American Boomtown===

The first official lease of the mines on behalf of the US government was dated September 30, 1822 and made to James Johnson, brother of US Senator Richard Mentor Johnson. Martin Thomas, appointed by the government in 1824 to oversee mine leases, was commissioned to survey the mines in 1826.

The name &quot;Galena&quot; was purportedly proposed during a town meeting that year; rejected names included Jackson, Harrison, and Jo Daviess. After Thomas platted the town, starting in June 1827, settlers could lease plots from the government. The land remained in government possession until the leasing system was eased out in 1836–37. When Jo Daviess County was founded in 1827, Galena was named its county seat. This established the first courts in Galena; previous legal proceedings were heard in front of the Superintendent of Lead Mines. 21 million pounds of lead were mined in Galena from 1825 to 1828, and the population skyrocketed in that time from 200 to 10,000.

Local native tribes, then mostly Meskwaki and Ho-Chunk, permitted settlers to mine in established areas in Galena. However, the growth of the city led settlers to encroach on native land claims, as they sought new veins of lead. Following a murder of a pioneer family near Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, by the Winnebago, Galena closed its mines for safety and European-American residents prepared for war. They constructed forts at nearby Elizabeth and Apple River; although these were not used during the conflict, the forts provided residents with security and protection. The ensuing Winnebago War was little more than a skirmish, but as a result, the US annexed more lands near the city in the resulting 1829 Treaty of Prairie du Chien which they forced on the Winnebago.

A meeting of townspeople on February 1, 1830, established the first fire department. At a town meeting at the county courthouse on September 7, 1835, sixty-five residents approved a motion for incorporation as a town. Eight days later, five individuals were elected as the first trustees. Incorporation was approved by the county board of trustees on October 2, and the first meeting of trustees occurred the next day. The 15th Illinois General Assembly (1836–37) codified the trustee election process. A steamboat was selected as the town seal on May 22, 1837.

A state law governing local jurisdictions resulted in the town holding its first elections for mayor and aldermen on May 24, 1841, to replace the board of trustees. Charles S. Hempstead was elected the first mayor, with 185 of the 356 votes cast. The first US census of the town was also held that year, recording 1,900 inhabitants. Hempstead would serve until 1845.

Indigenous peoples of the Americas traded galena with French traders as early as 1692. Julien Dubuque mined the ore in Iowa from 1788 until 1810. From 1807 until 1834, the United States government controlled leases, after which the lands were put up for sale. In 1839, David Dale Owen made a geologic survey of the region. The Ordovician Galena limestone contained most of the galena ore, and peak productivity occurred between 1840 and 1850. By 1845 Galena was producing nearly 27,000 tons of lead ore annually, and Jo Daviess County was producing 80 percent of the lead in the United States. In 1852, the region produced 87 percent of the American output, and 10 percent of the world&#x27;s, with pollutants from Galena&#x27;s industry found as far away as Lake Matoaka in Tidewater Virginia.

Once one of the most important cities in the state, Galena was a hub on the Mississippi River between St. Louis and St. Paul. Due to erosion, the Galena River is now inaccessible to steamboats. The first railroad built in Chicago, the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad, was intended to join the two cities but construction ended in 1853 at Freeport. Trackage between Freeport and Galena was completed by the Illinois Central Railroad in 1854, and later extended west to Dubuque, Sioux City, and Council Bluffs. Galena received national attention in the 1860s as the home of Ulysses S. Grant.

===Decline===
Following a sharp decline in the demand for lead (which had been the city&#x27;s chief income source during the early 19th century), Galena&#x27;s population has dropped from 14,000 in the mid-19th century, to 3,396 in the early 21st century.

===Today===
Galena&#x27;s official flag was adopted in 1976 to symbolize mining, agriculture, steamboats, and the nine American Civil War generals who lived in the city. Until the late 1980s, Galena was a small rural farming community.

In 1990, local industries included a Kraft Foods cheese plant, Lemfco Foundry, John Westwick&#x27;s foundry, and Microswitch, Inc. In the 1980s, Galena Mayor Frank Einsweiler initiated a tourist campaign. Since that time Galena&#x27;s business district has emphasized its historic assets in the face of suburban development. Such long-standing businesses in the downtown area, including Stair&#x27;s Grocery, Sullivan&#x27;s Grocery, Clingman&#x27;s Pharmacy, the oldest continuously operating pharmacy in Illinois, and Hartig Drug, closed their downtown locations. Clingman&#x27;s and Hartig&#x27;s relocated to the outskirts of Galena, while Stair&#x27;s and Sullivan&#x27;s closed their doors permanently because of competition. In late 2010, Clingman&#x27;s joined the Hartig&#x27;s family and moved their pharmacy to Hartig&#x27;s Drugs location along Highway 20.

The Country Fair in Grant Park has been an attraction that has helped increase tourist traffic to Galena as a destination. It is a craft show that attracts thousands of visitors to the area. The once boarded-up Main Street buildings have been renovated since the late 20th century. In 2010, Galena started a campaign called Vision2020, modeled after neighbor Dubuque, Iowa&#x27;s Vision 2010. A committee worked on outreach efforts with the community to form a vision of what residents wanted Galena to focus on for the next decade: five major concepts have been supported. In 2010, the 32nd annual Halloween Parade attendance was estimated at 15,000. In 2011, TripAdvisor listed Galena among its top-ten &quot;Charming Small Towns&quot;.

==Geography==

Galena is located at (42.418171, −90.431472) along the Galena River, which is one of many tributaries of the Mississippi River.

According to the 2010 census, Galena has a total area of , of which (or 99.83%) is land and (or 0.17%) is water.

Galena is located in the Driftless Zone, an area that was not covered by glaciers during the recent ice ages. This area, which includes the far northwestern corner of Illinois, escaped glaciation, while almost the entire state was glaciated, nearly to its southern tip. Because it escaped glaciation, this area is known for its hills, valleys, bluffs and considerable exposed rock.

Horseshoe Mound is a hill located outside Galena that U.S. 20 winds around before entering Galena. The view from Horseshoe Mound is one of the most photographed spots in the city. It stands at above sea level.

===Climate===
Galena has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: Dfa), with cold winters and hot summers. Annual precipitation is about 36 inches, with a distinct peak in summer.

Because of the city&#x27;s proximity to the Galena River, buildings have been threatened on numerous occasions by flooding. Eventually the Army Corps of Engineers built a dike to prevent city flooding. Galena&#x27;s Congressman, Leo E. Allen, helped acquire funding for city floodgates which were added in 1951 to connect to the river levee system. Significant recorded floods include:
*1828 – In Galena&#x27;s first recorded flood, the water was high enough to allow steamboats to travel on city streets.
*1937 – A flood inundated Main Street with up to five feet of water, causing serious damage to downtown buildings.
*1972 – A storm upstream caused the flood gates to be closed but the river flooded the sewage treatment plant and backed up sanitary and storm sewers. Sandbags were placed around storm manholes to keep water from flooding the downtown with three feet of water.
*1993 – Almost eight feet of water threatened downtown Galena, but was stopped by the city&#x27;s floodgates. Late spring season rainfall led the Mississippi and Galena Rivers to their highest recorded levels.
*2010 – On July 22, eight inches of rainfall in one night caused the river to swell to twice its usual level. The flood gates were closed, protecting downtown, but many businesses and homes reported damages to basements and lower levels. Had the flood gates not been in place, it was estimated that six feet of water would have covered Main Street. Damages were estimated between $7–8 million. President Obama declared the county a federal disaster area on August 19.
*2011 – In a 12-hour period between July 27 and 28, Galena received between 10 and 15 inches of rain. The Galena River rose to more than twice its normal height and possibly its highest recorded level since the floodgates were erected. The Grant Park sign, built in the 19th century, was washed away and there were major damages to downtown businesses, the city&#x27;s trail system and roads. Initial damage estimates were around $16 million.

==Culture==
Galena is the home to the Galena Art Center and the Galena Arts and Recreation Center. Turner Hall, a 19th-century building on Bench St., has been restored to serve as a performance venue and a popular wedding site. Galena is also home to several historic sites owned by the State of Illinois including the Old Market House, the Ulysses S Grant Home, and the E.B. Washburn Home. The Galena/Jo Daviess County Historical Society also owns a number of historical sites including the Galena and U.S. Grant Museum and the Old Blacksmith Shop. They are building a new museum building at the site of the Stillman Mansion property.

Galena hosts dozens of major events a year, including the annual Halloween Parade which draws thousands of onlookers. 

===Tourism===
Galena is a popular tourist destination hosting well over one million visitors each year. Galena is also popular with Chicagoans, many of whom keep second homes in the area. Galena is largely popular as a result of its historic walkable urbanism, a rarity among American cities.

===Cityscape===

85 percent of the structures in Galena are within the Galena Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and greatly contributes to the city&#x27;s popularity. The Old Market House State Historic Site, built in 1845, is a museum of local social history. Main Street was one of the first in the state to require architectural review of exterior building modifications. Zoning restrictions against wood-structure buildings contributed to the prevalence of brick buildings. All along Main Street the architectural style and historic feel create a unique atmosphere.
Efforts to improve the existing infrastructure while preserving the character of this neighborhood continued in 2003 with the adoption of a comprehensive plan. The plan outlines details on burying utilities, replacing parking with bike lanes and several beautification initiatives. This historic district has garnered the attention of dozens of volunteer groups who work to beautify and increase the utility of the area.
As the premier street in the second most popular tourist destination in Illinois those planning Main Street must be focused on balancing new developments along the waterway, and the transition to commercial stores with the charm provided by natural areas and long standing businesses. Trolley Cars follow parade routes north and south on Main Street and connect shopping to parks and wineries. The town is home to several wineries in the Upper Mississippi River Valley AVA. In the area, there are 450 vineyards and 100 wineries available to visit. Main Street in downtown Galena has a large number of specialty shops, restaurants, a brewery, and multiple wineries.

Galena&#x27;s Saint Michael&#x27;s Church was founded by the pioneer priest Father Samuel Mazzuchelli. The church is named after one of the three Archangels. Opened in 1855, the downtown DeSoto House Hotel is the oldest operating hotel in Illinois. Rooms 209 and 211 of the hotel were used as Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s campaign headquarters during his presidential campaign. Future president Abraham Lincoln gave a speech from the hotel&#x27;s Main Street balcony on July 23, 1856, supporting John Fremont&#x27;s bid for presidency. Two years later, on July 25, 1858, Senator Stephen Douglas spoke from the same balcony. Other famous guests include Theodore Roosevelt, Mark Twain, Susan B. Anthony, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Horace Greeley, Frances Willard, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Robert E. Lee, Chief Black Hawk, Millard Fillmore, and Zachary Taylor. General Winfield Scott Hancock stayed in Room 223 for an extended period of time. There are also several resorts and golf courses in the Galena area.
In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, Galena Main Street was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by the American Institute of Architects Illinois component (AIA Illinois) and was recognized by USA Today Travel magazine, as one of AIA Illinois&#x27; selections for Illinois 25 Must See Places.

===Education===
John O. Hancock opened the first school in September 1826. The Galena Academy followed in 1832. Galena is home to Galena High School.

==Notable people==
===The nine generals===
Galena was the home to nine Civil War generals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dispatch/Argus-2011-12-23&quot;&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Foremost among these is Ulysses S. Grant, who first came to Galena with his wife Julia and children in 1860 to work in the family tannery and leather-good shop. A veteran of the Mexican–American War, Grant was called upon to train a regiment of volunteers raised in Galena when the Civil War broke out in 1861. Through the support of local congressman Elihu B. Washburne, Grant became Galena&#x27;s first general when promoted by Abraham Lincoln on May 17, 1861. Washburne later served a brief stint as Grant&#x27;s Secretary of State and then as Minister to France. Victories at Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountain prompted Lincoln to promote Grant to lieutenant general on March 3, 1864, giving him command of all Union Armies.

Grant returned victorious to Galena in 1865 and the citizens gave him an Italianate two-story brick house, today recognized as the Ulysses S. Grant Home State Historic Site. He was selected as the candidate of the Republican Party for the 1868 presidential election. Grant was elected and served two four-year terms. He did not return to Galena. 

Augustus Louis Chetlain, who captained the regiment that Grant trained, was later brevetted to major general. Jeweler John E. Smith, who raised the 45th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, was also brevetted a major general. Ely S. Parker drafted the Appomattox surrender terms of the Confederacy and was the only Native American general of the Union. President Grant appointed him Commissioner of Indian Affairs in 1869. John Aaron Rawlins, who served a term as city attorney in 1857, was brevetted in 1865 and briefly served as Grant&#x27;s Secretary of War. Brevetted brigadier general John C. Smith later served as Illinois Treasurer, Lieutenant Governor, and Grand Master of the state Masonic order. Gunsmith Jasper A. Maltby was promoted to brigadier general at the Siege of Vicksburg. John Duerr was brevetted in 1865, and later was a successful merchant in Monticello, Iowa. William R. Rowley was brevetted in 1865, and later became a county judge.

<text>Scales Mound is a village in Jo Daviess County, Illinois, United States. The population was 436 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The original town of Scales Mound was located at the base of an erosional remnant similar to Charles Mound, about a mile southwest of the present-day village. In 1830 Samuel Scales purchased the original village site from John Sole and built a tavern at the base of the mound along Sucker Trail, a major east-west corridor. The land that the present-day village of Scales Mound is on was purchased from the U.S. government in 1848 by a man named Dunning. Little is known about Dunning or the use of the land until the 1850s.

In 1851 the Illinois Central Railroad (ICRR) was established and it would become a major factor in the settlement of much of rural Illinois, including Scales Mound. In September 1853, anticipating the arrival of the railroad, the village of Scales Mound was platted by Josiah Conlee and B.B. Provost. During the summer of 1854 track crews from ICRR laid out of track between Scales Mound and Apple River and trains were running the line the day after completion. With the arrival of the railroad, Scales Mound&#x27;s first building was constructed in the late fall of 1854, a store built by Sherman Eddy.

==History==

Vienna was originally an Indian trading post in the early 1800s, the forming of Vienna far preceded the rise of the railroad and coal industries in the region, but it was not named after Austria&#x27;s capital. Platted as early as 1818 - the same year Illinois became a state - and named the county seat, Vienna was incorporated as a village in 1837 and then as a city in 1893. It has served as the county seat for close to 200 years. In fact, the first post office opened in 1821 before the town was ever incorporated. Vienna is also one of the settlements tens of thousands of Native Americans were forced to pass through in 1830 en route to Oklahoma where they were relocated by the U.S. government. That forced migration westward came to be known as the Trail of Tears due to the brutal conditions that the Native Americans faced. Having to walk barefoot in the middle of winter, thousands died by order of the U.S. government. The Johnson County Courthouse was built in 1868 and is one of the oldest active courthouses in the state. Total cost of the project 140 years ago was a little more than $80,000 (approximately $1.5 million in 2021).

==History==
Long before Europeans settled in Algonquin, the Potawatomi Native Americans originally inhabited the land. Algonquin was the location of Indian burial mounds known in the 1800s as the Algonquin Mounds. By 1834 the first settler of Algonquin, Samuel Gillilan, came to the area from Virginia. Settlers Dr. Cornish, Dr. Plumleigh, Eli Henderson, Alex Dawson, and William Jackson arrived shortly thereafter. There was some dispute regarding the original name of Algonquin, and numerous other names were suggested including Denny&#x27;s Ferry, Cornish Ferry, Cornishville, and Osceola. But Samuel Edwards suggested the name Algonquin and on December 23, 1847, the name Algonquin became official.

The first signs of economic growth occurred in 1855 when the town saw the construction of the railroad, which enabled farmers in the neighboring area to have other means of getting their products to the markets in Chicago. Finally on February 25, 1890, the Village of Algonquin was formed.

The Village Hall of Algonquin was erected on January 31, 1907, at 2 South Main Street, and is still standing today, where it functions as a historical landmark and community gathering place. It served as the village hall of Algonquin until a new village hall was built at 2200 Harnish Drive in 1996.

From 1906 to 1913, the automobile companies began to go to the Algonquin Hill Climbs, which was an event where if an automobile was able to make it up a series of steep hills in the village, it would be given the stamp of approval. And because of that, the Algonquin Cup was formed which received national recognition at the time. The two hills used in the race were the Phillips Hill which extends from Illinois Route 31 to the cemetery and Perry Hill, located south of downtown, and which is now Lundstrom Lane. The village created a new hill for the race called Huntington Hill, which is now Huntington Drive. A park stands in place of the finish line of Huntington Hill at the intersection of Huntington Drive and Circle Drive which is called Hill Climb Park. The festival in recognition of the event continues to be held each year.

Algonquin road route 62 now, was once noted as the first bridge to be installed on an incline. The first bridge was level with a steep incline headed east. It was later replaced with a 4 lane bridge with an incline to reduce stress on vehicles headed east.

For much of the 20th century, Algonquin was a quasi-resort town and people from the Chicago area would visit the town in order to escape urban life. The Fox River offered immense recreational opportunities and several summer homes were constructed. Soon, more people began living in Algonquin year-round. Algonquin remained a small town for much of the 20th Century, growing steadily, until the 1980s, when the village&#x27;s population exploded with new residential construction. The development continued in earnest in the 1990s and 2000s. The village&#x27;s first shopping center, Algonquin Town Center, was constructed in the late 1980s on East Algonquin Road and numerous die &amp; mold industries were established west of downtown. In the 1990s, development shifted to Randall Road, which saw the construction of numerous retailers, restaurants, and services, beginning in 1993. In 2004, the 80-store Algonquin Commons outdoor mall (the largest outdoor mall in Illinois) opened for business, followed by the Algonquin Galleria outdoor mall, which is under development and saw its first stores open in 2006. In the mid-2000s, development also began on the Algonquin Corporate Campus, which is slated to include industrial and office development spread over on the southwest side of the village, bringing hundreds of high-paying jobs to the area.

==Government==

==Transportation==
Pace provides bus service on Route 550 along Randall Road in Algonquin connecting Crystal Lake and Elgin.

Algonquin is a center of transportation for McHenry and Kane Counties. Some of the major roadways include:
*Randall Road is a major multi-lane highway serving the village&#x27;s western side. The road is entirely lined with major outdoor shopping malls, big-box retailers, restaurants, and a major corporate center which serve the region. For a mile-long stretch between Harnish Drive and Corporate Parkway, near the village&#x27;s malls, the road is six lanes wide with a landscaped center median with dual left turn lanes. Elsewhere, the road is four lanes wide with a striped median with single left turn lanes. The road connects Algonquin with Crystal Lake and Lake in the Hills on the north and Carpentersville, Elgin, South Elgin, Geneva, and the rest of the Fox River Valley suburbs to the south.
*Illinois Route 25 is a north-south road on the village&#x27;s eastern side which ends at Illinois Route 62. It connects the village to Carpentersville, East Dundee, Elgin, and the rest of the Fox River Valley suburbs to its south.
*Illinois Route 31 (Main Street) is a major north-south road going through the heart of the village&#x27;s downtown. Despite Route 31&#x27;s high traffic volume, the road is only two lanes wide with a center striped median and left turn lanes, resulting in considerable backups at the road&#x27;s intersection with Algonquin Road. In the Old Town District, there are on-street parallel parking spots to service the downtown shops located along the road. Because the shops and many other buildings are so close to the road, widening is not an option to ease traffic congestion, so a western 31 bypass of the village&#x27;s downtown is planned. This bypass would include an interchange at Algonquin Road, currently one of the most congested intersections in McHenry County. Illinois Route 31 connects to Crystal Lake and McHenry on the north and Carpentersville, West Dundee, Elgin, and St. Charles on the south.
*Illinois Route 62 (Algonquin Road) is a major east-west arterial road. West of Illinois Route 31, the road loses the Illinois Route 62 designation and becomes a county highway (Algonquin Road) that continues west to Illinois Route 47. The road is locally infamous for its westbound backups from Sandbloom Road west to Illinois Route 31, particularly during the weekday evening rush hour. Algonquin Road is four lanes with a center median for its entirety in the village. West of Randall Road, the median is landscaped, while east of Randall, it is striped. Algonquin Road connects the village to Huntley on the west and other major northwest suburbs like Hoffman Estates, Schaumburg, Arlington Heights, Mount Prospect, and Des Plaines on the east. West of Pyott Road, Algonquin Road roughly forms the border between Algonquin and Lake in the Hills.
*Lake Cook Road terminates at East Algonquin Road on the eastern edge of the village and connects it to Barrington, Palatine, Arlington Heights, Buffalo Grove, Wheeling, Northbrook and Glencoe.
*Pyott Road and Lakewood Road terminate at West Algonquin Road, just north of the village limits, and connect the village to Lake in the Hills, Crystal Lake, and Lakewood.
*Longmeadow Parkway is a minor east-west road that currently connects Huntley Road on the southwest side of the village to IL Route 62 in Barrington Hills via a newly constructed bridge (2019) over the Fox River.
*Other important roads within Algonquin include Highland Avenue, River Road, Haegers Bend Road, Sandbloom Road, Souwanas Trail, Edgewood Drive, Hanson Road, County Line Road, Sleepy Hollow Road, Huntington Drive, Harnish Drive, Square Barn Road, Stonegate Road, Bunker Hill Drive, Boyer Road, and Corporate Parkway.

Algonquin was previously served by a rail line between Elgin and Crystal Lake. It closed in the 1930s.

==Religion==
Churches in Algonquin include:
*St. Margaret Mary Catholic Church, a large catholic church complex, which includes a church, ministry, rectory, and a private K-8 school, located just east of Old Town Algonquin, along the south side of East Algonquin Road between South Hubbard Street and Eastgate Drive. Since the early 2000s, Algonquin has seen a huge number of Poles migrating to Algonquin and the church holds several services, including Polish speaking masses, for the Polish community. The church is affiliated with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockford.

The last dairy plant closed in the 1970s.

Since the early 1990s, Burlington has been home to two small plastics companies. Concerns have been raised over the environmental impact these plants will have on the town and surrounding areas in the future. On November 6, 1990, Burlington was incorporated as a village, along with nearby Lily Lake and Virgil, in an effort to establish stricter guidelines regarding plastic manufacturing and chemical dumping in the area.

<doc id="111368" wikidata="Q1044751" url="?curid=111368" title="Carpentersville, Illinois">
<text>Carpentersville is a village in Kane County, Illinois, United States. The population was 37,983 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Chicago metropolitan area.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Carpentersville has a total area of , of which (or 97.57%) is land and (or 2.43%) is water.

==History==
 Julius Angelo Carpenter (August 19, 1827 – March 30, 1880) was the founder of Carpentersville, Illinois and its first prominent citizen. Carpenter came with his family from Uxbridge, Massachusetts and settled near the Fox River, along with his father Charles Valentine Carpenter and his uncle Daniel. Angelo was the first person to settle Carpentersville. Carpenter built the settlement&#x27;s first store, bridge, and factory. He served two consecutive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives. In 1837, the brothers, en route to the Rock River, made camp along the east bank of the Fox River to wait out the spring floods that made continuing their oxcart journey impossible. They ended up staying in the area to settle what was then called Carpenters&#x27; Grove.

For the next hundred years, Carpentersville did not grow as rapidly as other Fox River communities which had more direct rail connections to Chicago. The electric interurban railroad came to Carpentersville in 1896. The line was built by the Carpentersville, Elgin and Aurora Railway from a connection with the streetcar system in Elgin, Illinois and ran for four miles, terminating at the Illinois Iron and Bolt foundry on Main Street. This company changed ownership several times, including the Aurora, Elgin and Chicago Railway. It ended up being owned by the Aurora, Elgin and Fox River Electric Company in 1924. This line was always operated separately from the rest of the system, which included all traction lines between Carpentersville and Yorkville. This was a great convenience to factory workers who traveled to Elgin and for Elgin workers to come to Carpentersville. The line was used by everyone to enjoy Elgin&#x27;s Trout Park and to enjoy the &quot;summer cars&quot; for a cool ride. The line started to fail with the onset of the Great Depression and the establishment and paving of Illinois Route 31, which encouraged automobile use and the creation of a bus route. The final blow came in 1933, when a tornado destroyed the bridge over the Fox River just south of West Dundee.

Until the 1950s, Carpentersville consisted of a street grid along the Fox River centered on Main Street, which was the only highway bridge across the Fox River between Algonquin and Dundee. The Meadowdale Shopping Center, which was anchored by Wieboldt&#x27;s, Carson Pirie Scott, Cook&#x27;s and W.T. Grant; it also featured an indoor ice skating rink, overshadowed the commercial district along the River. A large section of the shopping mall on the north side was torn down in the 1990s and a new post office building was built.

In 1956, to reflect this population shift, Dundee Community High School relocated from its former site on Illinois Route 31 to Cleveland Avenue (now Carpentersville Middle School). In 1964, a second high school, named for Irving Crown, opened on Kings Road on the northern edge of Meadowdale. The two schools have now merged. DeLacey (one of the schools built on Kings Road) was closed and demolished, and was remade on Cleveland Ave.

From 1958 to 1969, Carpentersville was home to the Meadowdale International Raceway, a long automobile race track located west of Illinois Route 31 which was also started by Besinger. The site is now a Township Park and County Forest Preserve.

In the 1990s and 2000s, Carpentersville began to expand is development further west along Randall Road with the construction of many new subdivisions and shopping centers.

==Governance==
Carpentersville operates under the council-manager form of government in which an elected Board, consisting of the President (chief elected official) and six Trustees, appoints a professional manager to oversee the day-to-day operation of government services and programs. The council-manager form of government combines the leadership of elected officials with the experience of a professional manager.

Despite protests outside of village hall by the Hispanic community, the ordinance passed 5–2.

Nearby communities (Algonquin, Huntley, Lake in the Hills, Gilberts, Sleepy Hollow, West Dundee, East Dundee, Pingree Grove) have also seen an increase to their Latino population, although at a more gradual pace, resulting in more integrated communities.

==Meadowdale Shopping Center==

Meadowdale Shopping Center opened in 1957 and grew to as many as 53 stores by 1958. Over time the number of tenants has gone down; current tenants include Walmart, Tractor Supply Company and a large post office.

In 1952, the Village of Carpentersville proposed a plan for an enclosed shopping center amid residential areas.

On November 1, 1954, Leonard W. Besinger started construction planning on the mall which would become one of the largest shopping center developments in the United States at that time, and in December 1955, ground was broken for the $10,000,000 development. On May 18, 1957, the grand opening of the first 14 stores in the shopping center was held. In October 1957 construction was underway for 40 additional stores. The first of these stores to open was the Grant&#x27;s department store on October 17, 1957, followed by R&amp;S and Richman Bros.

On November 20–22, 1958, the shopping center held the grand opening of its Winter Garden Annex, an enclosed area centered on an ice rink which featured a Block &amp; Kuhl department store, (later bought by, and renamed, Carson Pirie Scott), the Winter Garden restaurant, St. Mauritz cocktail bar, snack bar, and other stores. The opening festivities included fashion shows on the ice rink, pony and other kiddie rides, and children&#x27;s theater performances.

By this time the center&#x27;s tenants included an appliance repair store, an appliance store, the Charles bakery, barber shops, beauty salons, Cole&#x27;s camera shop, the McMullens &quot;children&#x27;s department store&quot;, Urban Cleaners, the St. Mauritz cocktail bar, Mrs. Stevens&#x27; candy shop, a currency exchange, the Block &amp; Kuhl department store, women&#x27;s apparel shops including Eleanor, Lorraine Anne, Rorry&#x27;s and My Shop, the Chicago Furniture Mart, a gift &amp; card shop, the Western Hardware &amp; Supply hardware store, a hobby shop, the ice skating rink and Michael Kirby ice skating school, Jacob&#x27;s Jewelers, a liquor store, a medical center, a photo studio, a post office, a radio station, restaurants including the Winter Garden and Kings &amp; Queens, Frank&#x27;s shoe repair shop, shoe stores, a sporting goods store, a Piggly Wiggly supermarket, a travel agency, and a variety store.

In November 1959, Wieboldt&#x27;s held the grand opening of their Meadowdale store.

On October 25, 1960, President John F. Kennedy gave a speech about his presidential election campaign. He talked about fair education for young children and housing.

On November 19, 1963, a fire destroyed the mall area causing $3,000,000 worth of damages, destroyed 25 stores and the ice rink in the Wintergarden Arcade. Rebuilding began immediately and one year later the mall re-opened on November 5, 1964. However, the ice rink did not return, and in 1965, Carson Pirie Scott was converted into a Clark&#x27;s discount department store, The shopping center continued on through the 1970s with roughly the same number of tenants, counting 56 stores and services in 1979.

In the 1980s, the mall experienced decline. In October 1980 a competing mall, Spring Hill Mall opened to the west. Spring Hill Mall had stronger anchor stores Sears and Marshall Field&#x27;s.

In 1989, the north end of the mall and half of the east end - in total - were demolished, according to mall management &quot;in order to build to suit future tenants&quot;. The Post Office was doubled in size.

In 1990, there were only 28 tenants. Besides the post office, these included apparel, food, drug, video, electronics, shoe, wine and liquor, and hardware stores; cinemas; a print shop, beauty salon, barber shop, cleaners, bakery, Domino&#x27;s pizza, Chinese restaurant, hair salon, bowling alley, insurance and travel agencies and a laundromat.

The mall now has fewer than two dozen tenants, housed in the strip mall portion. In 2016, a Walmart opened on an out-parcel at the east end of the mall.

<text>Elburn is a village in Kane County, Illinois, United States. The population was 5,602 as of the 2010 census, up from 2,756 at the 2000 census. It is located at the intersection of Illinois Route 38 and Route 47. Elburn is a town situated west of the Chicago Loop with frequent commuter rail service from its Metra station at the end of the Union Pacific West Line.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Elburn has a total area of , all land.

==History==

On May 2, 1834, William Lance arrived in the Elburn area, and soon built a home there. Shortly thereafter, a man named Henry Warne arrived and opened a stagecoach inn called the Halfway House, since it was halfway between Oregon, Illinois and Chicago.

When the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company built through the area in 1854, the stop at this site was named Blackberry Station after the Township. The village incorporated as Elburn in 1886.

The village was originally named Blackberry Station, but was changed at the request of the railroad. The name Elburn itself derives from its originally suggested name, Melbourne, but a suggestion to shorten the name resulted in the dropping of the &quot;M&quot;, leaving Elbourne. From there, it was shortened even further to Elburne, and then finally to Elburn.

Once largely rural, the area&#x27;s population began rapidly expanding in the 1990s with the arrival of large tract home developments. In January 2006, Metra began to provide passenger rail service from Elburn to Chicago on the Union Pacific West Line. This new station replaced Geneva as the western end-of-line making Elburn one of Chicago&#x27;s farthest western suburbs. A new station was also constructed in La Fox.

Elburn&#x27;s first large grocery store, a Jewel-Osco, was met in 2007 with both excitement and apprehension over its possible effects on local businesses.

== Transportation ==

* The village is located along the &quot;Golden Corridor&quot; of Interstate 90/Northwest Tollway. It has direct access to I-90 via a full interchange at Illinois Route 47. Conversion of the interchange from an eastbound interchange to a full interchange was completed in November 2013.
* Illinois Route 47 serves as the chief north–south artery in Huntley. Handling over 20,000 vehicles a day, Route 47 was expanded from two to five lanes in 2011. Portions of Route 47 between Kreutzer Road and I-90 are six lanes. Route 47 connects to Woodstock to the north and Pingree Grove and Elburn to the south.
* Algonquin Road and Main Street/Huntley-Dundee Road act as the village&#x27;s primary east–west routes. Algonquin Road is a four-lane divided highway that connects Route 47 to other suburbs to the east like Algonquin and Lake in the Hills. Main Street connects to Marengo and Harmony roads on the west (leading to U.S. Route 20 and towns such as Marengo, Hampshire, and Union), while Huntley-Dundee Road connects to the Carpentersville-Dundee area to the east.
* Other important streets in the village include Ruth Road, Reed Road, Kreutzer Road, Haligus Road, Del Webb Boulevard, and Church Street. Reed and Kreutzer are local east–west roads, while Haligus, Ruth, and Church are local north–south streets. Del Webb Boulevard is the primary collector road in the Sun City neighborhood.
* The village is located along a branch of the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railroad, thus many of the village&#x27;s industries are near the railroad for convenient access to Elgin, Rockford, Chicago, and the rest of the continent.
* Beginning in 2027, Huntley will be a stop on the Rockford Intercity Passenger Rail project connecting Rockford to Chicago. The twice-daily route will be operated by Metra.
* The town is considered, while everything is spread apart, quite walkable and very bikeable. Wide multi-use paths exist on the side of nearly all the major roads (normally on just one side).

<doc id="111375" wikidata="Q2127297" url="?curid=111375" title="Montgomery, Illinois">
<text>Montgomery is a village within the Chicago Metropolitan Area of Kane and Kendall counties, Illinois. The village is a suburb/exurb of Chicago located roughly southwest of the city. The population was 20,262 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The first European settler arriving in the area was Jacob Carpenter, who came to the Chicago area from Logan County, Ohio, in November 1832. In the fall of 1835, Daniel S. Gray, from Montgomery County, New York, visited the area where his brother Nicholas Gray had located in the previous spring, on a farm now within the limits of Kendall County. He made immediate preparations to settle there, and in the fall of 1836, after his family moved from New York state, he built the first wooden house in the area. It was located in the southern part of what is now Montgomery, near the west bank of the Fox River.

Daniel Gray is considered the founder of Montgomery, and bought land grants from the federal government, and had ownership of large tracts of land.

The settlement was called &quot;Graystown&quot; for several years, but eventually Gray convinced other settlers to call the small village &quot;Montgomery&quot; after the New York county where he and several other settlers had origins.

Daniel Gray founded many companies in Montgomery, including a tavern, store, warehouse, foundry, combine and fabrication shop, and one of the best stone grain mills in the county (Gray–Watkins Mill). Gray was making preparations for more business operations, including the establishment of a stationary engine factory, when he died in October 1855. Upon his death, he still owned the majority of the lots in the village. His heirs continued to sell these lots and the village continued to grow.

On February 17, 1858, the village of Montgomery was incorporated. Ralph Gray, son of Daniel Gray, was elected as the first village president. The population of Montgomery remained fairly consistent at about 300 people during the rest of the 1800s.

For much of the twentieth century, the village grew slowly and steadily. Lyon Metal was founded in Montgomery in 1904, and participated in the war effort of World War II. The Aurora Caterpillar manufacturing plant located along the southern border of Montgomery has been producing wheel-loaders since 1959. Western Electric had its Montgomery Works plant along River Street, which became Lucent Technologies and was closed in 1995. In 1962, this factory employed 1,500 people and made telephone parts.

==Geography==
Montgomery is located in southern Kane County and northern Kendall County. It is bordered to the north and east by Aurora, to the south by Oswego and Boulder Hill, and to the southwest by Yorkville. The village sits on both sides of the Fox River. U.S. Route 30 passes through the village, leading southeast to Plainfield and northwest to Sugar Grove. Illinois Route 31 runs through the village on the west side of the Fox River, leading northeast to the center of Aurora and southwest to the center of Oswego. Illinois Route 25 runs along the east side of the Fox River, also leading to Aurora and Oswego.
According to the 2010 census, Montgomery has a total area of , of which (or 98.19%) is land and (or 1.81%) is water.

<text>North Aurora is a village in Kane County, Illinois, United States, and a suburb of Aurora. Per the 2020 census, the population was 18,261. North Aurora maintains its own public library district, fire district, and police department, but public spaces and parks are managed by the neighboring Fox Valley Park District.

== History ==
In its early history, North Aurora was known as &quot;Schneider&#x27;s Mill&quot; or &quot;Schneider&#x27;s Crossing&quot; after John Peter Schneider, a German immigrant who established a mill and dam on the Fox River after moving to the area in 1834. Schneider Elementary School, on the east side of the Fox River, is named after him.

North Aurora was named due to its location north of Aurora, Illinois. The 1880 US Census was the first federal census to use the place-name &quot;Village of North Aurora&quot;. It was formally incorporated in 1905.

== Public services ==

=== Schools ===
School-age children in North Aurora attend five public schools in the West Aurora Public School District 129, regardless of which side of the river they live on, with the exception of a few dozen homes in the far northeastern section of the village, in which the children attend Batavia School District 101. North Aurora&#x27;s own district was absorbed into its neighbor, Aurora, in the early 1960s.

=== Police ===
The village has 28 police officers with one chief and two deputy chiefs. After decades of sharing the same space as the village hall, the village constructed a new police headquarters at 200 S Lincolnway Street (IL Rt 31) in 2010. While an independent entity, there is some limited dependency on the Aurora Police Department; for example, calling the North Aurora police when the front desk is unattended will result in the call being answered by the Aurora Police Department 911 Center.

=== Fire department ===
The North Aurora Fire Protection District covers North Aurora. Station #1 opened in 1963 at the corner of State and Monroe and Station #2 opened on March 16, 2007, at 2201 Tanner Road. Village Ordinance #21 created and chartered North Aurora Village Fire Department in 1908 as a volunteer service. On July 7, 1958, the department was renamed the North Aurora and Countryside Fire Protection District to cover areas outside of the village limits. On November 1, 1993, the district hired a fire chief as its first full-time employee and a month later hired two full-time firefighters.

===Transportation===
Pace provides bus service on multiple routes connecting North Aurora to Aurora and other destinations.

North Aurora is served by the old CB&amp;Q line between Aurora and West Chicago, the oldest line on the BNSF system.

== Geography ==
North Aurora is located in southeastern Kane County. It is bordered to the south and east by the city of Aurora and to the north by the city of Batavia. Interstate 88 runs along the southern boundary of the village, with access from Exits 114 and 117. The highway leads east to Hillside in the Chicago suburbs and west to the Quad Cities. Downtown Chicago is east of North Aurora.

About 1.5% of families and 1.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 1.2% of those under age 18 and 4.8% of those age 65 or over.

==History==
The village is on the site of Sleepy Hollow Farm, which was owned by the late J. H. McNabb, board chairman of Bell and Howell Company. McNabb&#x27;s heirs sold the farm to Mr. and Mrs. Jack Polivka, who sold it in turn to Floyd T. Falese in 1953. Falese retained the services of a prominent planner and landscape architect, Raymond W. Hazekamp, who laid out a pattern of meandering roads, without curbs or sidewalks, that wound into curvilinear cul-de-sacs, avoiding the destruction of a single tree. This design retained the rural charm and natural contours of the farm and avoided taking down any existing trees.

Falese developed lakes in Sleepy Hollow from existing springs and stocked them with fish. Lake Paula and Lake Sharon were the first ones completed, with Lake Ichabod dug in 1962. Falese created Lake Legend and Lake Jacqueline in 1967. The village now owns and maintains several of the lakes. Early residents of the village could keep horses on their property, with outlots used as bridle paths.

The designs were carefully selected to enhance what Falese called &quot;the Sleepy Hollow concept of good living&quot;. Falese encouraged multiple builders and custom-built homes within the community. In the 1960s many of the homes were prefabricated Scholz Design Homes constructed by the Mark 60 Corporation.

Falese marketed lots in the unincorporated subdivision called &quot;Sleepy Hollow Manor&quot;. In 1958, the residents voted to incorporate Sleepy Hollow as a separate village rather than being annexed to West Dundee. In 1958, the Faleses purchased the Petitti farm, and in 1961 the Winmoor and Whitney farms added to the family holdings. By 1960, Sleepy Hollow&#x27;s population was 311. By 1970, it had grown to 1,729. The only commercial activity was the Sleepy Hollow Resort Motel (later renamed the Chateau Louise) and Crichton&#x27;s Super Mart. In 1966, the Glen Oak Country Club was opened as a member-supported outdoor pool facility (which was later transferred to the Dundee Township Park District.) Later, the Sleepy Hollow Elementary School was opened adjacent to the pool.

The Sleepy Hollow population continued to increase through the 1980s and 1990s as the remaining lots in Falese&#x27;s original subdivision were developed and as three other adjacent subdivisions were annexed: Saddle Club Estates, and Surrey Ridge and the Bluffs. Sleepy Hollow&#x27;s ability to annex additional land to the west and south is limited by an agreement with the city of Elgin, which also provides for the city to supply water to the village.

Sleepy Hollow has had its own police force since the 1960s. For years, it was a one-man force: Larry Sabatino Jr., the second police chief. The village named a park in his memory. On March 9, 2014, the Sleepy Hollow police force had its first fatal shooting in a domestic disturbance case.

In 2016, the village held a referendum to increase property taxes due to declining tax revenues and increased personnel costs. Officials urged voters to approve the tax increase or the village government could be dissolved. Voters approved a 33 percent property tax increase on March 15, 2016.

==Subdivisions in Sleepy Hollow==
The main subdivisions in Sleepy Hollow are:
*Deer Creek, a subdivision started in the 1990s by Windsor Development, and then became a custom home subdivision.
*Saddle Club Estates, a subdivision built in the late 1980s by PulteGroup featuring a park, green space, wooded lots, and some English and walkout basements.
*Sleepy Hollow Manor, the original subdivision to Sleepy Hollow still has some vacancies.
*Surrey Ridge, a condo, coach home, and single family subdivision started in the late 1980s by Windsor Development.
*The Bluffs, the newest subdivision in Sleepy Hollow, featuring semi-custom and custom homes.

==Gardens==
As a way to connect with residents, Sleepy Hollow operates a community garden, which rents garden plots to residents for personal gardening. The village also maintains the &quot;Giving Garden&quot;, from which produce is donated to local food pantries. As part of the rental agreement for the community garden, renters must volunteer at the Giving Garden.

==History==

In 1835, Elder John and Nancy Oatman established a tavern and a store that became the core of the community. Others settlers came, and in 1837 they held a lottery to determine who would name the town. Alexander Gardiner won and named the town Dundee in honor of his Scottish hometown, with which West Dundee is now sister cities. In 1843 Scotsman Allan Pinkerton, later the renowned detective, set up business as a cooper. The town was incorporated in 1887.

Dundee was hemmed in from development for years. The Fox River formed a natural eastern barrier. To the north and west, the D. Hill Nursery, founded in 1855 by William Hill, specialized in fruit trees. The business grew to include evergreens, some of which were sent to Chicago for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in 1893. Expanding to 900 acres, the nursery survived the Great Depression by running a cattle feed operation that continued through World War II. Some of the thousands of seasonal workers traveled to work from Chicago by electric rail, while the majority lived on the nursery grounds.

In the 1950s, a segment of the Hill property was sold and turned into the Highlands subdivision, which was annexed into West Dundee in 1956. The community also annexed property west of Illinois 31 in 1957, Royal Lane in 1960, and the Old World subdivision in 1966. The nursery eventually sold all of its land and moved to McHenry County. Plans for the Spring Hill Mall on Hill&#x27;s land began in 1973 and the project was completed in 1980. The 1.1 million-square-foot mall&#x27;s retail sales boosted West Dundee&#x27;s economy and created an estimated 1,600 jobs by 1982. New subdivisions were built to the west of Spring Hill Mall.

With a population of 7,331 (2010 Census data), West Dundee has managed to keep its quaintness and small-town feeling intact. Designated historical sites fill the downtown and surrounding residential neighborhood. Restored buildings include structures reported to have provided refuge for slaves on the Underground Railroad. Portions of downtown West Dundee are included with the Dundee Township Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places.

John Jacob Astor had founded the company in 1808, and when the United States banned foreign (i.e. British and Canadian) companies (such as the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company) from competing in the country after the War of 1812, it flourished. By 1830 it had a near monopoly of fur trading in the midwest, but the number of local trappable wild animals had declined.

In 1832, Noel Le Vasseur arrived as the Astor firm local fur trading agent, establishing a trading post in the area, and becoming the first permanent non-Native American settler. He married Watseka, niece of a Potawatomi chieftain, and after the Potawatomi were relocated to Iowa, recruited French-Canadiens to settle around his store. The Potawatomi were forced to move westward by a series of treaties culminating in the Treaty of Tippecanoe, which Congress ratified in 1833. The treaty reserved two sections for Potawanomi chief Me-she-ke-te-no, and one section each for Catish (Mrs. Bourbonnais Sr.) and Manteno (daughter of Francois Bourbonnais Jr.). LeVasseur received considerable land through a series of shrewd trades, and eventually divorced Watseka and married a Canadian woman named Ruth. After establishment of the new Catholic diocese of Chicago, missionary Fr. Stephen Badin briefly settled in Bourbonnais Grove in 1846, before retiring further south.
In 1853, the Illinois legislature split Iroquois County, and Bourbonnais Grove became part of new Kankakee County. Because the Illinois Central Railroad ran through Kankakee, founded in 1854, it became the county seat, with Bourbonnais Grove as one of several townships. In 1858, residents built the Maternity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Church, and soon nuns of the Congregation of Notre Dame arrived from Canada to teach and provide nursing care. Two years later they founded Notre Dame Academy. In 1865 clerics of St. Viator founded St. Viator College for boys.

After a referendum in 1875, the settlement incorporated as the Village of Bourbonnais, with George R. LeTourneau as its first mayor, and trustees Francois Sequin, Joseph Legris, Alexis Gosselin, P.L. Monast, Alex LaMontagne, Joseph Goulet, Jacob Thyfault and Len Bessette. LeVasseur died, aged 80, four years later. LeTourneau also became mayor and sheriff of Kankakee as well as state senator; his home (begun in 1837 and with renovations completed in 1866) eventually became headquarters of the local historical society, which is also restoring the garden and nearby arboretum. After enrollment declines in the early 20th century, in 1940, the Catholic institutions were bought out by what became Olivet Nazarene University, since the Protestant school in nearby Vermillion County had burned down the previous year.

The original French pronunciation of &quot;Bourbonnais&quot; came to be Anglicized over time to . In 1974, a state representative from Bourbonnais introduced a resolution &quot;correcting&quot; the pronunciation of the town&#x27;s name to , closer to the French. In 1976, for the U.S. Bicentennial, the Village Board passed a resolution making &quot;ber-buh-NAY&quot; the official pronunciation.

In 1999, the town was the site of a major train wreck, the Bourbonnais train accident.

Bourbonnais was home of the summertime training camp of the Chicago Bears professional football team from 2002 to 2019. In 2020, the team relocated their training camp to their headquarters at Halas Hall in Lake Forest, Illinois after major renovations of the building complex.

Bradley was mostly a blue collar town, with the Kroehler furniture factory and the Roper stove factory, a subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck, being the major employers.

In the 1980s, as elsewhere in the Midwest, these factories closed, and after their closures, parts of those factories burned to the ground. However, by the end of the decade, things changed. In 1989, a new shopping center called Bradley Square was built with Wal-Mart as the first tenant, and more shops followed. Northfield Square Mall opened in 1990.

* Northfield Square Mall

== Industry ==

CSL Behring operates a large manufacturing plant near the southern portions of the village. The facility produces plasma derived medications and equipment. In 2018 it was announced that the existing plant was to undergo a massive expansion that could possibly take up to twelve years to complete. The company bought up land to the south of the existing facility that previously housed a cooking oils plant operated by Bunge Limited, and plans to build upon that open space as a part of the large upgrade. The old cooking oils plant had ceased operations in 2015. Once complete, the plant will be split into two portions- the north campus, which includes the now upgraded existing plant, and the south campus- the new property that is currently being constructed. The project is expected to create over 200 jobs and is accruing about 450 million dollars in construction expenses.

Monical&#x27;s Pizza, an American regional pizza chain (locations in Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and Wisconsin), has its corporate headquarters in Bradley.

==Transportation==
River Valley Metro provides bus service on multiple routes connecting Bradley to destinations in the Kankakee area.

<text>Manteno is a village in Kankakee County, Illinois, United States. The population was 9,210 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Kankakee-Bourbonnais-Bradley Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
===Origins of village name===
Manteno was named after Manteno (Mawteno), a daughter of Francois Bourbonnais, Jr. (thus her grandfather was the man for whom the city of Bourbonnais was named) and his Potawatomi wife. A Potawatomi name, it is a possible anglicization of &quot;manito&quot; or &quot;manitou&quot;, a Potawatomi word for &quot;spirit&quot;. Oliver W. Barnard, an early settler in this area, spelled her name &quot;Mantenau&quot; in a poem, romanticizing the Potawatomi maiden.

First known as &quot;Lower Crossing&quot;, Momence was named after a local Potawatomi, Isadore Moness. Momence was first platted by Dr. Hiram Todd in 1846. It is located on the Kankakee River. In July, 1893, a crew paid for by an appropriation from the neighboring State of Indiana cut a shallow channel not quite a meter deep through a limestone ledge running just east of Momence, which had for millennia partially blocked and restricted the flow of the Kankakee River, making up to that point the Grand Kankakee Marsh, then the nation&#x27;s largest inland wetland, possible. The increased river flow, while doing little for the citizens of Illinois, drained thousands of acres of Indiana wetlands, permitting them to be profitably farmed, while destroying most of the Marsh.

The second railroad ran east and west and was called the &quot;Three I&quot; or Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa Railroad, later the New York Central. At this railroad intersection, a business center for the rich agricultural community was developed. Because the portion of land south of the crosstracks seemed to be best due to drainage, the new settlers began building there. This placed Reddick in Norton Township in Kankakee County.

Coal was discovered under the land north of Reddick in the 1860s. Railroad spurs were built around 1888 to coal mine towns near Reddick: Clarke City, Oklahoma, Tracy, and Cardiff, but by 1918, all four were ghost towns. Strip mining was performed north of Reddick between 1950 and 1974. The first Reddick Electric Plant was opened in 1906. The General Telephone Company, originally organized as a farmer&#x27;s cooperative, still required the services of an operator to switch calls until 1964.

The first school in the village was constructed in 1902 and consisted of two rooms and a library, and employed two teachers. By 1906, the library was converted into another classroom, a third teacher was hired, and a two-year high school was established. In 1915, a four-year high school course was added. In 1919 Reddick Community High School was organized, and a new building was constructed in 1921. The grade school was remodeled in 1949 and 1974. Children attended the Reddick School District, known better as &quot;RUCE&quot;, an acronym that consisted of the villages that were part of the school district (Reddick, Union Hill, Campus, and Essex). The Reddick High School Bulldogs, whose colors were orange and black, were known for their excellence in American football. In 1988 Reddick joined the Herscher School District. An addition was added to the grade school in approximately 1996 and the high school was torn down in 1998 due to wear from aging and asbestos. The Reddick Grade School building was utilized as one of the grade schools that served children of the Herscher School District for grades K – 6. This arrangement was changed to just grades 4 and 5 in 2005. Due to financial concerns, the Herscher School District decided to close the Reddick Grade School in the summer of 2013. In 2014, Herscher Community School District decided they no longer needed the school and sold it to the Reddick Fire Department. All children in the Reddick area now attend Bonfield, Limestone, or Herscher schools in the #2 school district. 

In the 1980s, Highway 17, which led traffic through Reddick, was rerouted to bypass the village. The railroad tracks were removed and made into a bike trail in the early 1990s.

<text>Union Hill is a village in Kankakee County, Illinois, United States. The population was 58 at the 2010 census. It is included in the Kankakee-Bradley, Illinois Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The settlement of the town is accredited to brothers Cornelius and John E. Schobey. With the second believed to be the town&#x27;s founder when he moved to neighboring Essex Township in 1854. John Schobey opened a post office in 1861 during the start of the civil war. This inspired Mr. Schobey to make it so the settlements name had the word &quot;union&quot; included. After some trial and error the area became known as Union Hill around the same time. The Indiana, Illinois and Iowa Railroad (now the Kankakee Belt Route) was built through the area in 1882, which triggered the expansion of the town.

Union Hill was possibly incorporated as a village in 1903 or 1904.

<text>Boulder Hill is a census-designated place (CDP) in Oswego Township, Kendall County, Illinois, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 8,394. It is part of the Chicago metropolitan area on the Fox River, south of Aurora.

==Geography==
Boulder Hill is located at (41.7113530, -88.3351400).

According to the United States Census Bureau, Boulder Hill has a total area of , of which or 99% of its land and or 1% of its water.
Up until the early 2000s, the Boulder Hill subdivision had a small development area, equating to almost a town square. The community itself has a strong identity, as the people from Boulder Hill are not classified as being from Montgomery or Oswego, two nearby larger towns.

Postal service is provided to Boulder Hill via the Montgomery Post Office. While Boulder Hill is unincorporated and not part of the village of Montgomery, there is confusion due to Boulder Hill residents&#x27; mailing addresses including &quot;Montgomery&quot; as the designated address. Governmental services provided to Boulder Hill primarily come from either Kendall County or Oswego Township offices.

The community has four churches, a grocery store, a small retail development, a gas station, three schools (two elementary and a middle school), a retirement facility, and the area used to have an automotive dealership. There is minimal vacant land left for development. The villages of Oswego and Montgomery have both expanded their communities up to the boundaries of Boulder Hill, so there is no room for further business expansion. Other than the Boulder Hill Market, most of the commercial businesses located in Boulder Hill are part of the village of Oswego.

Being unincorporated, Boulder Hill&#x27;s property taxes have risen in recent years as the various taxing bodies such as the Oswegoland Park District and the Oswego School District have expanded to keep up with the growth of adjacent communities such as Oswego. So while Boulder Hill was previously known for having low property taxes because it does not have its own government, that is no longer the case.

<text>Joliet ( ) is a city in Will and Kendall counties in the U.S. state of Illinois, southwest of Chicago. It is the county seat of Will County. It had a population of 150,362 at the 2020 census, making it the third-most populous city in Illinois.

==History==
In 1673, Louis Jolliet, along with Father Jacques Marquette, paddled up the Des Plaines River and camped on a huge earthwork mound, a few miles south of present-day Joliet. Maps from Jolliet&#x27;s exploration of the area showed a large hill or mound down river from Chicago, labeled Mont Joliet. The mound has since been flattened due to mining.

In 1833, following the Black Hawk War, Charles Reed built a cabin along the west side of the Des Plaines River. Across the river in 1834, James B. Campbell, treasurer of the canal commissioners, laid out the village of &quot;Juliet&quot;, a corruption of &quot;Joliet&quot; that was also in use at the time. Just before the economic depression of 1837, Juliet incorporated as a village, but to cut tax expenses, Juliet residents soon petitioned the state to rescind that incorporation.

In 1845, local residents changed the community&#x27;s name from &quot;Juliet&quot; to &quot;Joliet&quot;, reflecting the original name. Joliet was reincorporated as a city in 1852. Cornelius Covenhoven Van Horne was active in getting the city its first charter, and because of this, he was elected Joliet&#x27;s first mayor. When the city later built a new bridge, it was named the Van Horne Bridge.

==Geography==

According to the 2010 census, Joliet has a total area of , of which (or 98.95%) are land and (or 1.05%) is covered by water. It has a sprawling, irregular shape that extends into nine different townships, more than any other Illinois city. They are: Joliet, Plainfield, Troy, New Lenox, Jackson, Channahon, and Lockport in Will County, and Na-Au-Say and Seward in Kendall County. Joliet developed along the Des Plaines River, and its downtown is located in the river valley.

Joliet has a &quot;west side&quot; and &quot;east side&quot;, referring to areas in relation to the river.

With the construction of highways and suburban development to the west, many businesses moved from the downtown area to the expanding areas west of the river. Many stores relocated to the west side in new strip malls and shopping centers with more parking and easier access. These changes resulted in the decline of the downtown shopping district, which is still felt today. Today, Joliet has a &quot;west side&quot; and a &quot;far west side&quot; (which includes all city limits in Kendall County). This has given rise to a newly referenced &quot;Central Joliet&quot; portion of the city, which essentially is all land west of the Des Plaines River and east of Interstate 55. This new reference may soon change the current meaning of &quot;west side&quot; to west of I-55.

=== Climate ===
Joliet has a hot summer humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;) with hot, humid summers, and cold winters with moderate to heavy snowfall.

The spiritual community in Joliet welcomes newcomers with open arms, offering regular worship services and religious education.
Joliet holds a very large Catholic population, and many Catholic institutions, including Joliet Catholic Academy and the University of St Francis.

==Economy==
Like many Midwestern and East Coast cities dependent on manufacturing industries, Joliet has experienced past economic troubles. , the rate of unemployment in Joliet was around 8.6%. The city is evolving from a steel and manufacturing suburb to a commuter suburb in the Chicago metropolitan area. Some new migrants to the Chicago area are working in bordering Cook County (the nation&#x27;s second-most populous county) and living in Joliet.

The downtown area of Joliet has slowly attracted new businesses to the area. The main attractions in Joliet&#x27;s city center are the Harrah&#x27;s Casino, Joliet Slammers baseball (Duly Health and Care Field), Hollywood Casino, and the Rialto Square Theatre, also known as the &#x27;Jewel of Joliet&#x27;, and has been called one of the world&#x27;s 10 most beautiful theaters. The 1999 film &quot;Stir of Echoes&quot; starring Kevin Bacon had scenes shot on at the Rialto Square Theatre (the hypnotism scenes in which James saw the word &quot;Dig&quot; on the movie screen), at the corner of Scott Street and Washington, and at the old Menards that took over the Wieboldt&#x27;s building at Jefferson Square Mall.

Among local landmarks are the Chicagoland Speedway (NASCAR) and the Route 66 Raceway (NHRA).

The Auditorium Building is located at the northeast corner of Chicago and Clinton Streets. Designed by G. Julian Barnes and built of limestone in 1891, it was controversial as one of the first buildings to combine religious, civic, and commercial uses. Nonetheless, people such Theodore Roosevelt visited and spoke at the building. The building was originally built for the Universalist Unitarian Church of Joliet, but the church sold the building in 1993, and it is no longer home to the congregation.

The Jacob A. Henry Mansion, 20 South Eastern Avenue, is a three-story, red-brick, Second Empire/Italian Renaissance-style structure built on a Joliet limestone foundation in 1873 (completed in 1876). The structure is set on bedrock and the entire basement floor is made of Joliet limestone from the building owner&#x27;s quarry. The walls of the structure are constructed of red Illinois sandstone and deep red brick specially fired in Ohio (wrapped individually and shipped by barge to Joliet). A commanding three-story tower is the focal point of the structure. The structure has steel trim with slate shingles on a mansard roof. The front and side porches are single slabs of limestone. The largest stone ever quarried lies in the sidewalk under the front entry gate. The stone is 9×22×20 ft. In 1885, an immense Byzantine dome was added to the south façade.

The interior of the Jacob A. Henry Mansion has elaborate polished-walnut woodwork, massive, carved pocket doors, original wood mantles, and a solid-walnut staircase. The original owner, Mr. Henry, was a railroad magnate, building railroads in Indiana, Ohio, and Illinois.

The Joliet Slammers won the 2011 Frontier League Championship in their first season as a team.

Chicagoland Speedway held events from NASCAR. During major races, the large influx of fans means that the number of people in the city is double that of the official figure. Next door to the Speedway, the Route 66 Raceway features National Hot Rod Association events on its drag strip. Joliet Central has become actively involved in Route 66 by building an alternative fuel vehicle. Autobahn Country Club, also located in Joliet, has held the SCCA World Challenge, Atlantic Championship, and Star Mazda Championship races since 2009.

It lies on both sides of the Des Plaines River, a major waterway in Northern Illinois, and was one of the principal ports on the Illinois and Michigan Canal. The Chicago &amp; Rock Island Railroad and Michigan Central came through in the 1850s, and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and Chicago &amp; Alton Railroad soon followed, with the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway and Milwaukee Road lines built around the turn of the century.

U.S. Highways 6 (the Grand Army of the Republic Highway), 30 (the Lincoln Highway), 45, 52, and 66 (Route 66) all ran through the city. In the 1960s, Interstate 55 and Interstate 80 made their way through Joliet, linking up near Channahon just west of the city limits. The phrase &quot;Crossroads of Mid-America&quot;, found on the Joliet seal, is an allusion to the intersection of I-80 and I-55 (and, historically, the intersection between the Lincoln Highway and Route 66).

Joliet Transportation Center is the final stop on the Metra rail lines from Chicago for the Heritage Corridor route from Chicago Union Station and the Rock Island District route from LaSalle Street Station. A third line, the STAR Line, would have also terminated at the station, but the project was shelved as of 2012.

Pace provides local bus service six days a week (no service on Sundays) with buses leaving from a terminal in downtown Joliet once an hour.

Amtrak serves Joliet Union Station daily via its Lincoln Service and Texas Eagle routes.

In the 2024 action comedy novel &quot;Carl and the Big Guy,&quot; title characters Carl McIntyre and Devin &quot;Dee&quot; &quot;The Big Guy&quot; Shields both reside in Joliet. In the novel - as part of their shadow courier service &quot;The Six-Four-Five Couriers&quot; - they are being pursued in their modified 1986 Ford F-150 named &quot;Lucky Black&quot; by a private military company that want&#x27;s their cargo. After a chase through a nearby oil refinery, Dee and Carl are then chased through Joliet, causing massive damage in the process.

In the 1980 John Landis film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, John Belushi&#x27;s Jake Blues is nicknamed &quot;Joliet Jake&quot; as he was imprisoned at the now closed Joliet Correctional Center. The Joliet Prison has been a site for many other films and television shows, such as the film &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to Prison&quot;, and the opening season of Fox&#x27;s &quot;Prison Break&quot; was filmed predominately at the Joliet Prison, at which time part of the prison was still in use.

== History ==
In the fall of 1834 the nucleus of the village was begun when George Markley and Samuel Jackson staked out the first claim and built a log cabin on the river bank near the house where Sam Adams now lives(408 Church St.). They claimed some 600 acres on both sides of the river and the next spring the dam to furnish waterpower for a sawmill which was also begun in 1835. The mill was located on the south side of the river.

Samuel Jackson came from Pennsylvania. A loyal Democrat, he supported the presidential campaign of Andrew Jackson with such vigor that he wore the nickname of “General” for the rest of his life. He was a member of the County Commissioners Court of Kendall County when the new court buildings were built. He married Eunice Tubbs.
The Millington Newark Cemetery is located on Church Street on the southern edge of the village, on top of the hill overlooking the village center. It is populated with over 3,000 graves, including a Revolutionary War veteran buried on the north side.

Samuel’s brother, Jesse Jackson, came from Pennsylvania for a visit and was so pleased with the location that he bought out Markley’s interest and moved his family here in 1836. His was the first frame house in Millington. That year the sawmill was completed and put into operation.

<doc id="111406" wikidata="Q1923761" url="?curid=111406" title="Oswego, Illinois">
<text>Oswego () is a village in Kendall and Will counties, Illinois, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 34,485. Oswego is the largest municipality in Kendall County. Part of the Chicago metropolitan area, it is an exurb of Chicago.

==History==

In 1833, William Smith Wilson, his wife Rebecca, and his brother-in-law Daniel Pearce moved to the area now known as Oswego. The land belonged to the local Potawatomi, Ottawa, and Chippewa tribes, but the United States government removed the Native Americans when the government started surveying the land along the Fox River in Kendall County. In 1842, the federal government placed the land for sale at an established price of $1.25 an acre.

After the sale of the land, Lewis Brinsmaid Judson and Levi F. Arnold from New York laid out the village and named it &quot;Hudson&quot;. However, when a post office was established, its location was given as &quot;Lodi&quot;. Confusion over the official name of the area led to a decision in January 1837, when the citizens gathered and voted &quot;Oswego&quot; as the permanent name of the village by a single vote. The village was named after Oswego, New York, &quot;Oswego&quot; being an Iroquois word meaning &quot;mouth of the stream&quot;. The ford across the Fox River in the town allowed Oswego to grow economically and as a town, eventually incorporated in 1852 with its village boundaries at the time being Harrison Street to the northwest, Jefferson Street to the northeast, Monroe Street to the southeast, and Benton Street to the southwest. At the advent of the automobile, Oswego continued to see growth as it became a hub for three different state highways (Illinois Route 25, Illinois Route 71, and Illinois Route 31).

Major community developments began when Caterpillar Inc. and Western Electric built industrial plants near Oswego in the mid-1950s. This initially allowed nearby Boulder Hill to develop. The next major development arrived in the mid-1980s during the suburban homebuilding boom, which allowed houses and buildings to populate the village. The rapid growth of the village allowed its limits to expand west of the Fox River into today&#x27;s boundaries.

Oswego is known to some Chicago-area residents for the town dragstrip on State Route 34, which was open from 1955 until 1979, where muscle cars were raced by drivers from all over the Midwest. The drag days are still celebrated even though the strip has been closed for decades. Although evidence of the drag strip, including parts of the track, still remain, the site is off limits to the public.

==Geography==
Oswego is located in northeastern Kendall County on the Fox River with a small portion in Will County. It is bordered to the north by Boulder Hill and Montgomery, to the east by Aurora, and to the west by Yorkville, the Kendall county seat.

According to the 2010 census, the village of Oswego has a total area of , of which (or 99.36%) is land and (or 0.70%) is water.

===Downtown===
Downtown Oswego is home to historic buildings and homes, as well as shops and restaurants. The Village of Oswego launched a project to enhance and restore the historic downtown district. This project included significant infrastructure and streetscape improvements, such as the installation of brick pavers, sidewalks, landscaping, and decorative streetlights and benches. Hudson Crossing Park, located along the Fox River, opened in October 2004 where many children and families enjoy the scenery. The Waubonsee Creek Promenade, which stretches from Main Street to the new park, is the final phase of the downtown enhancements. In 2008, the village celebrated its 175th anniversary.

===Recreation and leisure===
The Oswego area is home to over of open land, trails, and parks maintained by the Oswegoland Park District. Established in 1950, this governmental agency is guided to &quot;create opportunities for a healthy community&quot;. Overseeing 63 parks, of walking trails, two aquatic parks, and the Little White School Museum, the park district provides offerings for the community of 20,000 households as well as visitors from farther away.

The Oswego area holds several races for fitness enthusiasts. Several area festivals are coordinated by the park district, such as the annual PrairieFest.

<text>Plano is a city near Aurora in Kendall County, Illinois, United States, with a population of 11,847 as of the 2020 census. It is part of the Chicago metropolitan area, being about 55 miles (90 km) from Chicago. The city was home to the Plano Harvester Company in the late 19th century, as well as the Plano Molding Company more recently. In 2011, downtown Plano was used as a set for &quot;Man of Steel&quot;.

==History==

In the early 1860s, the Marsh brothers began producing their Marsh Harvester in Plano. From 1863 to the beginning of the twentieth century the Plano Manufacturing Company, as it became known, provided the foundation for Plano&#x27;s development. Because of this, Plano High School has adopted the &quot;reaper&quot; as its mascot.

Plano was the one-time headquarters for the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Joseph Smith III, son of slain LDS movement founder Joseph Smith Jr., moved to Plano in 1866 and ran the church&#x27;s printing operation from there. As the schism with the Utah branch of the Latter Day Saints deepened, he moved with the church headquarters to Lamoni, Iowa in 1880 to be closer to what the Community of Christ believed to be the true church headquarters at Temple Lot in Missouri rather than in Utah.

Community development has been centered around a strong agricultural setting, with the only inhabitants of the area before its incorporation being the owners of grist mills. This development was supported by the city&#x27;s location along US Route 34 and the &quot;Illinois Zephyr&quot; Amtrak passenger rail service.

The Plano Molding Company, manufacturer of fishing tackle equipment as well as other plastic domestic containment units, has its headquarters in Plano. Both of its original factories within Plano are still in operation, but the main bulk of production is now in nearby cities Sandwich and Mendota.

Plano and Sandwich have developed a sibling-like relationship. Both deeply agricultural cities are situated along a major trading route and rail artery. The two cities&#x27; high schools have developed a rivalry that has become known to the local press as the &quot;War on 34&quot;, due to their location along US Route 34.

In the early twenty-first century, multiple new housing developments were constructed in Plano. Due to the following economic downturn, however, many of the houses in both the new developments and older parts of town have experienced foreclosures. Nonetheless, Waubonsee Community College opened a satellite campus in Plano in late 2011.

In the summer of 2011, the City of Plano was used for exterior filming for the Superman movie, &quot;Man of Steel&quot;. Various farms around the city were also used with one being used for the Kent family farm, and the downtown area was remodeled and turned into a set for downtown Smallville. Other areas used for filming were nearby, and part of IL 56, north of Sugar Grove was shut down for two days for filming despite being closed for &quot;Road Repair&quot;. Plano declared itself Smallville during the filming. Signs have been erected at either end of town, as well as on the end of one building on Main Street, proclaiming a similar declaration. Additionally, a &quot;Smallville Superfest&quot; was organized the following summer, and has since been held annually in August.

===The Farnsworth House===
Master Architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe had worked on a retreat for Dr. Edith Farnsworth, a doctor from Chicago, whose complicated relationship with the architect soured the project. Cost overruns as well as questions on the house&#x27;s actual usefulness led to a lawsuit between the two parties, with van der Rohe winning the suit. In later years, the County Board decided to buy some of Farnsworth&#x27;s land in order to straighten Fox River Drive (Ben Street in Plano), which would need a new bridge as well. Farnsworth pleaded her case to the County Board, citing evidence that the Board would be doing construction on an old Indian Site, but to no avail. The road was straightened and the new bridge built; however, to this day, the old bridge piers are still visible. Around the same time, Silver Springs State Park and Wildlife Area was designated, down the road and across the river from Farnsworth&#x27;s house, forever protecting the land from development.

<text>Yorkville is a city within the Chicago Metropolitan Area and is the county seat of Kendall County, Illinois, United States. It is a western suburb of Chicago, Illinois. The population was 23,835 as of the 2022 census.

==History==

In 1836, the city of Yorkville was settled by early pioneers. Originally, the city&#x27;s main thoroughfare of Bridge Street was designed for horse-drawn carriages and pedestrians. As time passed, Hydraulic Street, which runs parallel to the Fox River, boasted a trolley that ran from Ottawa to Aurora. This part is now operated by the Illinois Railway.

At the time, Yorkville&#x27;s central business district was on the south side of the Fox River and the public square was north of the river, a layout unique to the region. The public gathering place was near the river&#x27;s edge. The Kendall County Courthouse was next to the downtown commercial district. Many of the city&#x27;s remaining historic single-family homes are within walking distance of Bridge Street, the courthouse and Union Hall. Earl Adams was the first to settle what would become Yorkville when he built his cabin on Courthouse Hill on the south side of town in 1833. One year later, Lyman and Burr Bristol set up residency in neighboring Bristol, north of the river.

When the county of Kendall was formed in 1841, Yorkville was chosen as the county seat. After a 13-year period in which Oswego claimed that honor, voters chose to relocate the county government in 1859 to Yorkville, a more central location. The new courthouse was completed in 1864. Replaced in 1997 with a courthouse on the city&#x27;s north side, the 1864 building is used by the Kendall County Forest Preserve and other organizations. Yorkville was no exception to the railroad boom. Development began and businesses sprang up in 1870 along the tracks and included Squire Dingee&#x27;s pickle factory, the Yorkville Ice Cream Company and the Rehbehn Brothers button factory. A few of those buildings still remain.

The present city of Yorkville was originally two towns, Bristol to the north and the Yorkville south of the Fox River, with separate governments for more than 100 years. In 1957, Bristol and Yorkville merged, becoming the United City of Yorkville. Ellsworth Windett became the combined city&#x27;s first mayor. As a part of the consolidation, the residents of both towns agreed to a uniform school district. It was in that same year high school classes began in the downtown area at the northeast corner of Van Emmon and Bridge Streets. In 1888, a two-story brick school building on West Center Street was constructed. After the construction of Circle Center School in 1968, the two-story building was closed and the space was rented by the Yorkville School District to neighboring Waubonsee Community College. Due to rising enrollment in the early 1970s, the school was reopened and renamed as Parkview Christian Academy.

<text>Galesburg is a city in Knox County, Illinois, United States. The city is northwest of Peoria. At the 2010 census, its population was 32,195. It is the county seat of Knox County and the principal city of the Galesburg Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Knox and Warren counties.

Galesburg is home to Knox College, a private four-year liberal arts college, and Carl Sandburg College, a two-year community college.

A section of the city is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Galesburg Historic District.

==History==
Galesburg was founded by George Washington Gale, a Presbyterian minister from New York state who had formulated the concept of the manual labor college and first implemented it at the Oneida Institute near Utica, New York. In 1836 Gale publicized a subscription- and land purchase-based plan to found manual labor colleges in the Mississippi River valley. Land was purchased for this purpose in Knox County and in 1837 the first subscribers to the college-founding plan arrived and began to settle what would become Galesburg.

Galesburg, populated from the first by abolitionists, was home to one of the first anti-slavery societies in Illinois and was a stop on the Underground Railroad. The city was the site of the fifth Lincoln–Douglas debate. held on October 7, 1858. Galesburg also was the home of Mary Ann &quot;Mother&quot; Bickerdyke, who provided hospital care for Union soldiers during the Civil War.

In later years, Galesburg became the birthplace of poet Carl Sandburg, artist Dorothea Tanning, and former Major League Baseball star Jim Sundberg. Sandburg&#x27;s boyhood home is maintained by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency as the Carl Sandburg State Historic Site. It includes the cottage he was born in, a modern museum, the rock under which he and his wife Lilian are buried, and a performance venue.

Throughout much of its history, Galesburg has been inextricably tied to the railroad industry. Local businessmen were major backers of the first railroad to connect Illinois&#x27;s then two biggest cities—Chicago and Quincy—as well as a third leg initially terminating across the Mississippi River from Burlington, Iowa, eventually connecting to it via bridge and thence onward to the Western frontier. The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&amp;Q) sited major rail sorting yards here, including the first to use hump sorting. The CB&amp;Q also built a major depot on South Seminary Street that was controversially torn down and replaced by a much smaller station in 1983. The yard is still used by the BNSF Railway.

In the late 19th century, when the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway connected its service through to Chicago, it also laid track through Galesburg and built its own railroad depot. The depot remained in operation until the construction of the Cameron Connector southwest of town enabled Amtrak to reroute the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; via the Mendota Subdivision and join the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; and &quot;Illinois Zephyr&quot; at the Burlington Northern depot. A series of mergers eventually united both lines under the ownership of BNSF Railway, carrying an average of seven freight trains per hour between them. With the closure of the Maytag plant in 2004, BNSF is once again the largest private employer in Galesburg.

Galesburg was home to the pioneering brass era automobile company Western, which produced the Gale, named for the town.

Galesburg was home to minor league baseball from 1890 to 1914. The Galesburg Pavers was the last name of the minor league teams based in Galesburg. Galesburg teams played as members of the Eastern Iowa League (1895), Central Interstate League (1890), Illinois-Iowa League (1890), Illinois-Missouri League (1908–1909) and Central Association (1910–1912, 1914).

Baseball Hall of Fame members Grover Cleveland Alexander (1909) and Sam Rice (1912) played for Galesburg. Rice had to leave the Galesburg team in 1912, when his wife, two children, his parents and two sisters were killed in a tornado. Galesburg teams played at Illinois Field (1908–1912, 1914), Lombard College Field (1908–1912, 1914) and Willard Field at Knox College (1890, 1895).

Lombard College was in Galesburg until 1930, and is now the site of Lombard Middle School.

The Carr Mansion at 560 North Prairie Street was the site of a presidential cabinet meeting held in 1899 by U.S. President William McKinley and U.S. Secretary of State John Hay.

==Festivals==
Galesburg is the home of the Railroad Days festival, held on the fourth weekend of June. The festival began in 1977 as an open house to the public from the then Burlington Northern. Burlington Northern gave train car tours of their yards. The city started having street fairs to draw more people to town. In 1981, the Galesburg Railroad Museum was founded and opened during Railroad Days. For a while, the city and the railroad worked together on the celebrations. In 2002, the railroad backed out of the festival and there were no yard tours. In 2003 the city worked with local groups to revamp the festival and the Galesburg Railroad Museum resumed bus tours of the yards. The Galesburg Railroad Museum has continued to provide tours of the yards since then. In 2010, the Galesburg Railroad Museum started offering a VIP tour of the yards, in which a select group of riders are allowed in the Hump Towers and Diesel Shop and see the BNSF at work. During the festival, one of the largest model railroad train shows and layouts in the U.S. Midwest happens during Railroad Days at the new Galesburg High School Fieldhouse.

During Labor Day weekend in September, Galesburg hosts the Stearman Fly in. Also in September are the Great Cardboard Boat Regatta and the Annual Rubber Duck Race, at Lake Storey. On the third weekend of every August, a Civil War and pre-1840s rendezvous is held at Lake Storey Park.

<text>Knoxville is a city in Knox County, Illinois, United States. The population was 2,911 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Galesburg Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==Description==

Knoxville is located just southeast of the City of Galesburg. There is a public square in the center of town with several historic buildings surrounding it including Knox County&#x27;s first courthouse, city hall, the Ball log cabin, the town gallows, and several other important buildings. The Knox County Fairgrounds is just north of Knoxville on Henderson Road. Knoxville is served with two exits on Interstate 74, at U.S. Highway 150 east of town and at Henderson Road north of town.

The Knoxville Cemetery lies in the northern part of town on Market Street. The Knox County Nursing Home is located in the city. There is a grade school in Knoxville, as well as a Junior High and a High School (KHS). Among the &quot;attractions&quot; in Knoxville are the historic buildings, Walnut Grove Farm and Rattle Toes exhibit, the Knox County Fair held in August, and the annual Knox County Scenic Drive held in October.

==History==

Knoxville was established on January 15, 1831, and called Henderson until its name was changed to Knoxville on December 22, 1832 when it became the county seat. It was one of the first 10 municipalities incorporated in the state and is the oldest town in Knox County. James Knox was a notable early resident.

Knoxville was the county seat until 1873, when the county seat was moved to Galesburg. The first Knox County Courthouse, completed in 1839, and second Knox County jail, completed in 1845, still stand in Knoxville and are registered on the National Register of Historic Places. The two buildings and Knoxville&#x27;s first general store, the Sanburn Log Cabin, built in 1832, have been restored and are open to the public. The county&#x27;s Hall of Records, built in 1854, is used as Knoxville&#x27;s City Hall.

The log cabin of John G. Sanburn was not discovered until decades after his death, when it was nearly destroyed. In 1832, Sanburn settled in Knoxville to open the first shop, which also served as the first post office. He was the first county clerk, circuit clerk, Indian master, and probate judge, as well as shopkeeper and postmaster. Years later, as the house built around Sanburn&#x27;s cabin was being demolished, a nosey neighbor spied the underlying log structure and alerted the authorities. At that time the owner of the property, Bernice LaFollette, donated the cabin to the city as a museum.

Typical log cabins like Sanburn&#x27;s measured about 14&#x27; x 14&#x27; wide and 7&#x27;-8&#x27; high with 9&quot; walnut lincoln logs, wooden door hinges, and clapboard shingles. The entire area of Sanburn&#x27;s cabin and general store served as a kitchen while encased in Johnson&#x27;s home. A restoration in 1964 insured proper security and insulation that Sanburn did not enjoy in the 1830s, including glass windows and cement sealant to replace clay and hay between logs.

The cabin contains general store memorabilia for display and a picture of an 1852 penny discovered in the foundation when the house was moved from the south to the north side of the square for restoration. The John G Sanburn Log Cabin is maintained by the Knox County Historic Sites. It is open for public view during the first two weekends in October for the Knox County Scenic Drive and from 2-4 p.m. Sundays, May–September.

In 1868, St. Mary&#x27;s School opened on the site where the Ewing Female University had previously been located.

The Old Knox County Jail was the location of the only legal hanging in Knox County when John Osborne was hanged March 14, 1873, for the murder and sodomy of Adelia M. Mathews, Yates City.

Abraham Lincoln stayed in Knoxville on his way to his debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Knox College in 1858. The hotel that he spent the night in was demolished but a plaque on the building currently at the site commemorates the occasion.

==Education==

ROWVA School District #208 is made up of five major towns: Rio, Oneida, Wataga, Victoria, and Altona. PreK-2nd graders go to ROWVA Central in Oneida, 3rd and 4th graders attend ROWVA West in Wataga, and 5th and 6th graders go to ROWVA East in Altona. The junior high is located in Oneida and is made up of 7th and 8th graders. The high school made up of 9th-12th graders and is also located in Oneida. ROWVA Central, ROWVA Jr. High, and ROWVA High School are all in one basic building, just different sections. ROWVA&#x27;s school colors are black, gold, and white, with their mascot being a tiger. The school is ending a five-year-long football co-op with AlWood at the end of the 2009 football season, in which they are the A&amp;R Bulldogs (black, silver, and white.) Starting in the 2009 fall season, ROWVA is also part of a sports co-op with Galva where they are the Mid-County Cougars (black, blue, and white.) ROWVA is a part of the Mid-County co-op for golf, cross country, junior high football, and will be adding high school football starting in the 2010 football season.

Rio was previously home to its own elementary school, which most humbly stands in the center of town; near the corner of Grande Avenue and North Main Street. It was opened in 1922. Due to its devastating energy costs, and lack of efficient output of students(36 students at date of closing for grades 1–6), coupled with other reasons, it was shut down for good in 2004. The building was purchased by Mike Gillette, who agreed to let local children utilize the modest and rusty playground equipment (which has since been removed) as a makeshift park. It has not been transformed into any business, and virtually no architectural or exterior changes have been made to it.

The village of Rio owns a baseball diamond and the land plot to its west and have turned it into a park with a public pavilion and concession stand for ballgames as well as a large playground structure that was paid for by the village and constructed during a community build day in July 2012.

<doc id="111427" wikidata="Q2303510" url="?curid=111427" title="Grand Ridge, Illinois">
<text>Grand Ridge is a village in LaSalle County, Illinois, United States. The population was 515 at the 2020 census, down from 560 in 2010. It is part of the Ottawa Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
In 1860, Judge John T. and Phebe J. (Finley) Porter moved to Illinois with their son Ebenezer F.(b. 1859 at New Salem, Fayette County, Pennsylvania), and located near Grand Ridge, LaSalle County, where they lived on a farm until 1872. Porter was at first a farmer, and afterward a lumberman and grain dealer. In 1872, he moved into the town of Grand Ridge, and built and operated two grain elevators. In 1882, he moved to Florida and engaged in the lumber business. He founded the town of Grand Ridge, Florida, naming it in honor of his old Illinois home.

In 1868, Nelson Jones (b. May 24, 1819, in Ross County, Ohio) bought two houses, two lots and a shop valued at $800; he was the first blacksmith in Grand Ridge Village. In 1870, the Fox River Division of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy (CB&amp;Q) Railroad was completed and put in operation. The first business house was built by E. Core the same year.

There are contradicting accounts of the Presbyterian establishment. According to Church Archives of Cumberland Presbyterian Church, in the spring of 1870, Robert Morgan (born August 18, 1838), son of Caleb and Nancy Antram, and Sarah Woodward moved to Grand Ridge, LaSalle County, Illinois with 4-year-old son Caleb Ewing Antram (born February 12, 1865) after their daughter Laura died in March 1868 at just 6 years old. William, Nellie, Mary E., Joseph W., Lewis W. and Ethel May were all born to the couple while living on the Antram homestead from 1869 to 1912.

In 1871, Cumberland Presbyterian was organized in Grand Ridge, Illinois, where Robert M. Antram was an elder ever since. From 1886 to 1891, it was known as Hudson Church. Membership numbered 145 in 1890 and church structure was erected that year. In 1891, the name changed to Grand Ridge by action of Mackinaw Presbytery. R. M. Antram was Clerk of the Session and Post Office until 1907, when the organization became defunct and did not participate in reunion with Presbyterian Church USA.

Another account holds that the Presbyterian church in Grand Ridge was organized June 17, 1865, in the Van Doren school house, by a committee from the Peoria Presbytery, consisting of the Rev. Robert Johnson and Rev. John Marquis. The original members were Wm. McMillan, Jane B. McMillan, Araminta Poundstone, Joseph Boyd, Elvira Boyd, J. T. Van Doren, Sarah C. Van Doren, James H. Boyd and Isabella Boyd. Other founding Families were Sutton, Farnham and Long. The house of worship was erected in 1864, at an expense of $1,800, and soon after, a parsonage, costing $800. The first pastor was Rev. John Moore, who remained some time.

In 1874, the owners of the land on either side of the road, David Crumrine and Joseph Boyd laid off a part of their respective lands adjoining the track, in town lots, after which building was commended on a more extended scale and now it is a very handsome farm village, and is a point from which large amount of grain and product finds its way to market. In the latter part of 1876, Porter sold his elevator to F. McIlvaine. E. Cole conducts another elevator, and it is estimated that in 1877 at least 1,200 car loads of grain we shipped annually. In 1871, F. H. Poundstone erected the second business house. In June 1873, Garrison &amp; Hornick opened a first class dry goods, notion and grocery house, meeting with lucrative return. In 1877, it was estimated that aggregate business of Grand Ridge Village would amount to $75,000 annually. In 1877, there were nine business houses, two physicians and a proportionate number of mechanics in Grand Ridge.

In 1875, The Victor Lodge, No. 578, Independent Order of Odd Fellows (IOOF) was instituted on June 11 and met every Saturday evening through at least 1877.

In 1903, the First National Bank of Grand Ridge was organized by Thomas Dean Catlin, banker and capitalist residing in Ottawa, Illinois (born in Clinton, New York, on March 12, 1838, son of Marcus and Philena Hunt (Dean) Catlin.

<text>LaSalle or La Salle is a city in LaSalle County, Illinois, United States, located at the intersection of Interstates 39 and 80. It is part of the Ottawa, IL Micropolitan Statistical Area. Originally platted in 1837 over , the city&#x27;s boundaries have grown to . Named in honor of 17th century Illinois valley explorer, the Sieur de La Salle, City boundaries extend from the Illinois River and Illinois and Michigan Canal to a mile north of Interstate 80 and from the city of Peru on the west to the village of North Utica on the east. Starved Rock State Park is located approximately to the east. The population was 9,582 as of the 2020 census, down from 9,609 at the 2010 census. LaSalle and its twin city, Peru, make up the core of the Illinois Valley. Due to their combined dominance of the zinc processing industry in the early 1900s, they were collectively nicknamed &quot;Zinc City.&quot;

==History==
LaSalle was named in honor of the early French explorer Robert de LaSalle.

===Canal port (1836–1933)===

The Illinois and Michigan Canal was first thought up by French explorer Louis Joliet. Much later, when Illinois became a state, the idea of a canal connecting Lake Michigan to the Illinois River was supported by many, including Abraham Lincoln. The 96 miles long canal was finally constructed between 1836 and 1848. Upon its completion, Chicago became the eastern terminus and LaSalle became the western terminus. LaSalle boomed as a transshipment point from canal boats coming from Chicago to steamboats going to St. Louis and New Orleans. It became a place where Northern and Southern culture met.

It is difficult to imagine the level of frenzied activity that once took place at locks 14 and 15, where the canal boat basin and the steamboat basins were located. Steamboats from New Orleans unloaded molasses, sugar, coffee, and fresh oranges and lemons. Canal boats from Chicago brought lumber, stoves, wagons, and the latest clothing styles from the east. Local farmers hauled corn and wheat to be shipped to Chicago and points east. Passengers hustled to make connections to canal boats bound for Chicago or steamboats headed to St. Louis and beyond. Hotels and other services were available to travelers. Many stores grew catering to canal trade.

Today the story can be told at the La Salle Canal Boat, &quot;the Volunteer&quot;.

===Zinc City (1858–1978)===

By the mid 1850s, LaSalle had begun to exploit the coal that lay underneath much of the city. The LaSalle Coal Mining Company completed the first shaft in 1856 and many other companies soon followed. By 1884 there were six shafts in the area, the deepest 452 feet. The history of LaSalle would have been different were it not for the arrival of two immigrants in 1858. Frederick William Matthiessen met German born Edward C. Hegeler at a prestigious mining school, and after graduating in 1856, the two traveled together to the United States. In 1858, attracted by the abundance of coal, coupled with the excellent transportation links provided by the canal and the Illinois Central Railroad, they chose LaSalle as the site for an innovative zinc smelting plant, the first in the United States. Before the plant opened, nearly all of the zinc used in the United States was imported. Zinc is needed to make brass and was a common fire-proofing material. Most significantly, zinc was used to prevent corrosion of iron and steel. With the opening of the first steel production plant in Joliet in the early 1870s, zinc became an important part of the local industrial economy. In a decade the Matthiessen and Hegeler Zinc Works became the largest producer of zinc in the country, and one of the largest in the world.

The Matthiessens, Hegelers and their families were involved in developing the community. They helped found industries such as the LaSalle Machine and Tool Company and the Western Clock Co. that would later become Westclox. Mary Hegeler married Dr. Paul Carus, who founded the Open Court Publishing Company in 1887, whose mission was &quot;establishing ethics and religion upon a scientific basis&quot; and was a key figure in introducing Eastern thought to the United States, making LaSalle &quot;Buddhism&#x27;s Gateway to the West.&quot; Matthiessen was a philanthropist, who served as Mayor of LaSalle from 1886–1895. He gave thousands of dollars to help build the sewer system, the electric light plant and roads and bridges. As the first president of the LaSalle-Peru High School Board, he was a generous donor to the school. In 1914, Matthiessen established the Hygienic Institute to combat epidemics. A public benefactor, Matthiessen opened much of his estate, called Deer Park, to the public with the nominal entrance fee going to charity. In 1943, this property was named Matthiessen State Park in his honor. On the day of his funeral in February 1918, the entire community suspended all business between 11 and 12 o’clock.

Today, this story is told at the Hegeler-Carus Mansion.

===Little Reno (1933–1953)===
With the end of Prohibition in 1933, saloons no longer operated under the euphemism of &quot;soft drink&quot; vendors, and these and related gambling concerns flourished. Although illegal, gambling proliferated in LaSalle, supporting the abundant and related tobacco, liquor, food, and lodging businesses.

Travelers arrived by car or via the Rock Island Rocket from Chicago for a Saturday night&#x27;s revelry in such numbers that the streets of LaSalle are said to have been standing-room only. There was wall to wall entertainment along First Street, at the heart of which was the Kelly and Cawley liquor and gambling house. LaSalle became known as &quot;Little Reno&quot; and boasted dozens of clubs. With between 60 and 80 saloons in LaSalle from 1940 to 1950 this continued to be the town&#x27;s primary commercial enterprise. In 1953 a federal raid on Kelly and Cawley&#x27;s ended the era.

===Largest employers===
The following businesses have more than 100 people staffed, making them the six largest in LaSalle:

* J.C. Whitney 313
* Carus Chemical 264
* Illinois Veteran&#x27;s Home 200
* LaSalle-Peru Township High School 180

==Geography==

LaSalle-Peru is at the center of a network of Illinois&#x27; largest cities, between Rockford, the Quad Cities, Peoria, Bloomington, and Aurora and Joliet at the edge of Chicagoland. They are at the crossroads of I-39 and I-80. It is located on a bluff above the Illinois River and the Illinois and Michigan Canal. The scenic sandstone bluffs and rivers of the area make it a destination for hiking and adventure tourism. LaSalle is the closest large town to two of Illinois most popular parks: Starved Rock State Park and Matthiessen State Park (created from the estate of LaSalle industrialist Frederick William Matthiessen).

The development of a coal mining region fragmented this micropolitan area into many small towns. LaSalle and Peru make up the center of this community often referred to as the Illinois Valley. There is a dense halo of small towns surrounding the twin cities, most of them formed as mining and industrial suburbs. These towns span Bureau, Putnam, and LaSalle Counties and include former coal mining towns of Spring Valley, Oglesby, Cherry, Ladd, Dalzell, Seatonville, Hollowayville, Mark, Granville, Standard, and Cedar Point, the industrial river and canal towns of Utica, Hennepin, and DePue, as well as the agricultural towns of Tonica, Lostant, McNabb, Magnolia, Arlington, and Troy Grove. When looking at job interdependence, these communities form a single whole. The population of LaSalle-Peru and its suburbs is over 42,000. Due to the fragmentation of the community across municipal, township, and county borders, the true size of the community is rarely measured. LaSalle-Peru and its suburbs form the largest community (20,696 jobs) in the Ottawa, IL Micropolitan Statistical Area where they compete with Ottawa-Marseilles and its suburbs (19,095 jobs) and the smaller trade centers of Streator (8,224 jobs), Princeton (9,322 jobs), and Mendota (5,813 jobs). The trade area of LaSalle-Peru also extends into Marshall County and the eastern portion of Lee County. The Ottawa Micropolitan Statistical Area is the 9th Largest Statistical Area in Illinois.

Downtown LaSalle is the hub of the community. The principal shopping streets are First Street, Marquette Street, and Gooding Street. It is one of the largest employment centers in the area with over 1,400 jobs. Downtown LaSalle hosts approximately 248 active businesses These small Downtown businesses cumulatively represent approximately and $419 million in gross annual sales.

According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, LaSalle has a total area of , of which (or 99.15%) is land and (or 0.85%) is water.

North Central Illinois ARTworks is a regional non-profit arts advocacy organization dedicated to supporting and expanding the arts community in the area; local visual artists often display their works in the gallery in the historic Westclox building. Matthiessen Auditorium at La Salle-Peru Township High School hosts many performing arts groups, including the LaSalle-Peru Township High School band, jazz band, choir, musical, and local junior high bands.

The Jazz in the Street festival has been held annually in mid-September since 2006. Most years, there have been appearances by locally popular bands, including the Illinois Valley Community College and Northern Illinois University jazz bands.

<text>Marseilles ( ) is a city in LaSalle County, Illinois, United States. An Illinois River town, the population was 4,845 at the 2020 census, down from 5,094 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Ottawa, IL Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Lovell Kimball arrived at the area along the Illinois River known as the Grand Rapids in 1833 from Watertown, New York. Kimball, aware that the Illinois-Michigan Canal Bill had passed and the canal would eventually reach the rapids, hired a surveyor to lay out a town. Kimball called the town Marseilles in reference to the French city of Marseille as he hoped it would become a similar industrial center in Illinois. Marseilles, pronounced the same as the French city, was officially platted on June 3, 1835; the plat was revised twice for railroad and canal right-of-ways.

===Nabisco Building===
In 1921 the National Biscuit Company (Nabisco) built an eight-story corrugated cardboard box production plant in Marseilles, the largest industrial building in the state (outside of Chicago) at the time, and the first air-conditioned factory in the Midwest. Nabisco was a major employer in the area but ceased production at the plant in 2002.

===Middle East Conflicts Wall Memorial===
In 2004 the Middle East Conflicts Wall Memorial was dedicated to the service men and women who gave their lives fighting in US wars anywhere in the Middle East. The Middle East Conflicts Wall Memorial is the first US memorial to servicemen dedicated while an actual war was ongoing. Currently, the earliest names on the wall are from 1967 commemorating the deaths during the USS Liberty incident.

Andrew Bacevich, American 
historian, felt that all presidential candidates should visit Marseilles, commenting that &quot;Just as there are all-but-mandatory venues in Iowa and New Hampshire where candidates are expected to appear, why not make Marseilles, Illinois, one as well. Let all of the candidates competing to oust Donald Trump from the White House (their ranks now approaching two dozen) schedule at least one campaign stop at the Middle East Conflicts Wall, press entourage suitably in tow.&quot; Andrew Bacevich lost his son in Iraq, his son&#x27;s name is included in the monument.

=== Museums ===
In 2016, Marseilles resident Seattle Sutton founded a community museum, located in the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad building. Its collection includes historical items from the Nabisco factory, other Marseilles businesses, and archived recordings of Marseilles war veterans.

<text>Mendota is a city in LaSalle County, Illinois, United States, in the state&#x27;s north-central region. The population was 7,061 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Ottawa, IL Micropolitan Statistical Area. Mendota is located approximately 85 miles west of Chicago, 70 miles east of Moline and 55 miles south of Rockford. The current mayor is David W. Boelk, an independent elected to a four-year term.

The name &quot;Mendota&quot; is derived from a Lakota word meaning &quot;junction of two trails&quot;, which was found appropriate for the city since there was a nearby railroad junction for the Illinois Central Railroad and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad.

==History==

In summer of 1853, the Illinois Central Railroad was completed and by the fall of that year, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad completed a crossing at the present site of Mendota. By the following year, the population had grown to more than 1,000 and the town was home to saloons, hotels, and various shops. The town was incorporated as a village in 1855 and reincorporated as a town in 1859. By 1860, the town was also home to churches of 5 denominations.

With the availability of the railroads to facilitate export, several manufactures of items ranging from organs to cigars and buttons opened factories in Mendota. By the end of the American Civil War, the population of the town had more than doubled to over 2,000. By winter of 1866, citizens voted on a referendum to secure a city government. Mendota was incorporated into its current city government on April 9, 1867.

A library was opened on September 8, 1874, with 1700 books secured by donation. It was acquired by the city government in 1894. The original building was replaced in 1905 by a new Carnegie Library.

A new Union station was opened on February 23, 1888, to replace the original depot which had burned down in 1885. The new building contained a hotel, restaurants, and separate waiting areas for passengers and railroad staff. Because of falling revenue and ridership, much of the station was torn down in 1942. The current Mendota station is the only remaining portion of the original structure.

<doc id="111438" wikidata="Q575292" url="?curid=111438" title="Oglesby, Illinois">
<text>Oglesby is a city in LaSalle County, Illinois, United States. The population was 3,712 at the 2020 census, down from 3,791 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Ottawa Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Oglesby was a center for mining coal, limestone, and silica, located near the confluence of the Illinois River and the north-flowing Vermilion River. Oglesby grew from an amalgamation of several mining villages, such as Kenosha, Portland, and Black Hollow. It was originally called Portland, due to the cement mined and manufactured in the area that was similar to Portland Cement from England. It was renamed in 1913 after the coal company and in honor of Richard J. Oglesby (1824–1899), a former U.S. Senator and three-time Governor of Illinois.

During the Civil War, the Kenosha Coal Company sank a coal mining shaft at Oglesby in 1865. Thatcher Tucker Bent purchased the mine and mineral rights as the Oglesby Coal Company. The mine was innovative and the Bents were very involved in the development of the community. Mrs. Josephine Bent even organized English classes for the immigrant miner&#x27;s wives. The Marquette Cement Manufacturing Company mined limestone and claimed that the Bent&#x27;s mine was causing collapses. The conflict eventually liquidated the Oglesby Coal Company, with the Bent selling the machinery to Marquette and auctioning off the farm animals. The Black Hollow Mine was dug in the 1890s as a slope mine along the Vermilion River. It provided coal to its owners, the Illinois Zinc Company in Peru, Illinois.

The surface ground layers around Oglesby had excellent exposed limestone and coal; Oglesby also had adequate riverine transport. It soon became an important center for cement manufacture. Before open-pit mining there were several subsurface cement mines:

*Illinois Clay Products Mine, 1913–1924
*Reynolds Clay Mine
*Marquette Cement Mine

As well as several coal mines:

*Jones Mine, 1865–1930
*Oglesby Mine, 1865–1919
*Deer Park Mine, 1900–1920
*Black Hollow Mine, circa 1890s

The mural&#x27;s muted earth tones faded badly over time and it was restored in 1988. In 1993 a post office janitor complained about the nudity of the features of the Native Americans depicted in the mural. The painting was covered by a venetian blind and only revealed upon request. A successful petition drive to remove the blinds was begun soon after.

<text>Ottawa is a city in and the county seat of LaSalle County, Illinois, United States. It is located at the confluence of the navigable Fox River and Illinois River, the latter being a conduit for river barges and connects Lake Michigan at Chicago, to the Mississippi River, and North America&#x27;s 25,000 mile river system. The population estimate was 18,668, as of 2022. It is the principal city of the Ottawa, IL Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Ottawa occupies a place on the Illinois River that has long been one end of a portage trail between the Mississippi River and Lake Michigan. Here the river was reliably deep enough for canoes. The North Portage Trail connected the site over land and water to the Chicago River.

Ottawa was the site of the first of the Lincoln–Douglas debates on August 21, 1858. During the Ottawa debate, Stephen A. Douglas, leader of the Democratic Party, openly accused Abraham Lincoln of forming a secret bipartisan group of Congressmen to bring about the abolition of slavery.

The John Hossack House was a &quot;station&quot; on the Underground Railroad, and Ottawa was a major stop because of its rail, road, and river transportation. Citizens in the city were active within the abolitionist movement. Ottawa was the site of a famous 1859 extrication of a runaway slave named Jim Gray from a courthouse by prominent civic leaders of the time. Three of the civic leaders, John Hossack, Dr. Joseph Stout and James Stout, later stood trial in Chicago for violating the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.

Ottawa was also important in the development of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, which terminates in LaSalle, Illinois, 12 miles to the west. In 1838, workmen from the canal project were causing public unrest. During a citizens&#x27; meeting, a local political leader, Washington Armstrong, suggested that farmer William Reddick be elected sheriff. Reddick was a popular choice due to his large stature and courageous manner. Reddick was elected by a large majority and held the office of sheriff for four consecutive two-year terms. In 1855, while serving in the Illinois State Senate, Reddick commissioned the construction of a large Italianate house for the then-large sum of $25,000 (~$ in ). Reddick Mansion is now one of the largest surviving homes in Illinois to predate the Civil War. In 1973, the mansion was added to the National Register of Historic Places, as part of the Washington Park Historic District.

On February 8, 1910, William Dickson Boyce, then a resident of Ottawa, incorporated the Boy Scouts of America. Five years later, also in Ottawa, Boyce incorporated the Lone Scouts of America. Boyce is buried in Ottawa Avenue Cemetery. The Ottawa Scouting Museum, on Canal Street, opened to the public on December 6, 1997. The museum features the history of Boy Scouting, Girl Scouting and Camp Fire.

In 1922, the Radium Dial Company (RDC) moved from Peru, Illinois to a former high school building in Ottawa. The company employed hundreds of women; the 2017 book &quot;Radium Girls&quot; by Kate Moore reveals that one of these employees was only 11 years of age. These women painted watch dials using a paint called &quot;LUMA&quot;, which contained a compound of ZnS(Ag) (Silver activated Zinc Sulfide) and powdered radium, for watch maker Westclox. RDC went out of business in 1936, two years after the company&#x27;s president, Joseph Kelly Sr., left to start a competing company, Luminous Processes Inc., a few blocks away. The employees of the company suffered radiation toxicity, as chronicled in the 1986 documentary, &quot;Radium City&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Ottawa has a total area of , of which (or 94.46%) is land and (or 5.54%) is water.

===Climate===
==Industry==

Because of numerous silica sand deposits (Ottawa sand was on board the ill-fated Columbia space shuttle for experimental purposes) Ottawa has been a major sand and glass center for more than 100 years. Transportation of the sand is facilitated by the navigable Illinois river and the Illinois Railway Ottawa Line. One of its largest employers is Pilkington Glass works, a successor to LOF (Libbey Owens Ford). Formerly concentrated in automotive glass, the plant now manufactures specialty glass and underwent a $50 million (~$ in ) renovation in 2006. Ottawa sand continues to be extracted from several quarries in the area, and is recognized in glass-making and abrasives for its uniform granularity and characteristics.

Sabic recently purchased GE Plastics, a successor to Borg Warner automotive glass manufacture, operates a large plastics facility in Ottawa, and is a major employer.

Ottawa sand is a standard testing medium in geotechnical engineering (laboratory demonstrations and research into new technologies).

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census there were 18,840 people, 7,764 households, and 4,658 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 9,014 housing units at an average density of .

About 13.5% of families and 16.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 24.9% of those under age 18 and 6.5% of those age 65 or over.

==Tourism==
Ottawa has many historic homes and registered historic landmarks. Recent additions to Ottawa have included renovations to its historic mansion, the Reddick Mansion, and artistic murals throughout the central business district. Ottawa is known as the scenic gateway to Starved Rock State Park, the most popular state park in Illinois, with some 2 million visitors per year. The Fox River, which flows through communities like Elgin and Aurora, empties into the Illinois in downtown Ottawa. Ottawa is also home to one of the largest skydiving operations in the country, Skydive Chicago.

The Ottawa Historical and Scouting Heritage Museum honors Ottawa resident, William D. Boyce, founder of the Boy Scouts of America.

Jacob C. Zeller founded the Zeller Inn and Court Place Tavern in 1871, at 615 Columbus Street. The original Zeller Inn was demolished in 1982. The Zeller Inn tavern, originally known as the Court Place, still remains, now called Zeller Inn. The courtyard patio area on Columbus street is where the original Zeller Inn stood. The tavern contains the original mahogany bar built by the Sanders Bros in Ottawa, marble counters, tiled floors and walls, stained glass door and light fixtures. It also was known for its Gilded Age brilliance — tiled mahogany bar, carved gargoyles, pressed-tin ceiling and solid oak backbar. The mirror on the bar is the same since its establishment in 1871, which was brought over from the 1800s era European Worlds Fair. Zeller&#x27;s initials, JCZ, are still visible in a tiled mosaic on the side of the bar and in the glass light domes that hang from the ceiling. This is one of the oldest taverns in Illinois, with original features which remain intact and displays the architectural details prominent in the late 1800s.

==Media==
Ottawa was served by two local newspapers. The older of the two, &quot;The Times&quot;, was formed in 2005, when the Streator-based &quot;Times-Press&quot; merged with &quot;The Daily Times&quot;, based in Ottawa. It is now an online newspaper. The second was a weekly newspaper called &quot;Ottawa Delivered&quot;, which closed in 2012. Ottawa is also served by the &quot;NewsTribune&quot; of La Salle, Illinois.

Ottawa also has three local radio stations, WCMY-AM at 1430, WRWO-LP at 94.5, and WRKX-FM at 95.3.

==&quot;Radium City&quot; documentary==
In 1986, documentary film maker Carole Langer made a film that covered the plight of the so-called &quot;Radium Girls&quot; who worked in the watch dial industry. The young women, who had been told the paint was harmless, ingested deadly amounts of radium after being instructed to lick their paintbrushes to sharpen them; as a lark, some even painted their faces and fingernails with the glowing paint. Over time, many of the women developed anemia, bone fractures, sarcomas, and necrosis of the jaw, a condition now known as radium jaw. Many of these women died young.

The documentary interviews survivors from the industry who relate their experiences of the poisoning and the bureaucratic hurdles they met in seeking compensation and justice. &quot;Radium City&quot; outlines the aftermath of these events with a focus on the social and political consequences as well as the medical ones.

According to the film, after Radium Dial Company opened in 1918, workers began to get sick, and a lawsuit was brought against the company. With the looming lawsuit, Radium Dial closed in 1936, but then re-opened in 1937, under the name Luminous Processes in another part of town. Luminous Processes remained in operation until 1978.

The film shows the dismantling of the empty building where Luminous Processes was housed as well as the hot spots from where the Radium Dial Company was dismantled and buried throughout the city. After the plant closed and before it was dismantled, many residents took items from the factory for their homes. This spread the contamination even further. The building materials from the Luminuous Processes building were eventually turned into landfill. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency began removing contaminated material in 1986. The work continues.

===Areas still affected by radiation===
Sixteen areas of Ottawa are still radioactive. The United States Department of Health and Human Services released a study, outlining areas where contamination by radium-226 (Ra-226), as well as emissions of radon-222 (Rn-222), are at or above normal levels. These areas include homes, public areas, schools, and even a car sales lot that is housed directly over the old Radium Dial Company site. A score of 28.5/100 or higher qualifies an area for the Superfund National Priority List, and Ottawa&#x27;s hazardous ranking score is 50/100.

The radium in Ottawa&#x27;s water supply occurs naturally in water from deep wells across northern Illinois. A reverse osmosis water treatment plant removes the radium so the city&#x27;s tap water complies with federal regulations.

<doc id="111440" wikidata="Q576648" url="?curid=111440" title="Peru, Illinois">
<text>Peru is a city in LaSalle and Bureau counties, Illinois, United States. The population was 9,896 at the 2020 census, down from 10,295 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Ottawa, IL Micropolitan Statistical Area. Peru and its twin city, LaSalle, make up the core of Illinois Valley.

==History==
The city&#x27;s first settler was John Hays, who arrived in 1830. The city was organized as a borough in 1838, incorporated as a village February 25, 1845, and incorporated as a city on March 13, 1851. The original plat was between West Street, 4th Street, and East Street (now Pine Street).

===River City (1831–1933)===

Since the first steamboat &quot;Traveler&quot; reached Peru in 1831, the city had high hopes of being the western terminus for the Illinois &amp; Michigan Canal. LaSalle won that designation, but Peru became a busy steamboat port at the head of navigation on the Illinois River. Captain McCormick was involved in the Five Day Line, making record fast trips between Peru and St. Louis, Missouri. Senator Gilson reported to land surveyor, Grenville Dodge, that the town would soon outstrip Chicago due to its favorable location along the river and railroads.

Water Street was a thin ribbon pressed between the bluff and the river, leading to the growth eastward of a large industrial district. Developed along the river and the canal, it was served by the Rock Island Railroad and Chicago Burlington and Quincy. These important transportation routes, along with coal mining in at least four mines lasting from 1857 until 1949, were the basis for Peru&#x27;s rise to an industrial center. Many entrepreneurs grew into prominent businessmen and advanced the interests of Peru and the region. Prominent companies from that time included Maze Lumber, Maze Nails, Peru Plow and Wheel Works, Huse and Loomis Ice Co, Brunner Foundry, Star Union Brewery, Hebel Brewery, Illinois Zinc (Peru and LaSalle were sometimes referred to as &quot;Zinc City&quot;) and many others. Peru&#x27;s citizens were intent on improving their town, so far as constructing a plank road, northwest of town, a toll road meant to reach Dixon, Illinois.

Peru&#x27;s story became a story of two levels. The story of Water Street and the bottoms, and the town growing above the bluff. Peru tried hard to link the two. For example, the Peru Horse and Dummy Railroad was driven to dissolution by the city&#x27;s impossible mandate that it create a loop from Water Street to the upper bluff.

===Clock City (1884–1980)===
In 1884, Stahlberg started the United Clock Company in Peru. Shortly afterward, it went bankrupt and was reorganized with the help of Frederick William Matthiessen as the Western Clock Company. By 1905 it had grown into a national company, producing over 1 million alarm clocks per year. In 1909, they trademarked &quot;Westclox&quot;. In 1917 they became a model for workers&#x27; benefits, one of the early companies to pay life insurance and have a safety committee. Later on, they limited the work week, constructed a company park with a tennis court and horseshoe courts, developed workers&#x27; housing, and established a school for watchmakers with provision for scholarships. In 1935 it was the safest company in the nation, with 11 million hours without a lost time accident.

During World War II the company made mechanical fuses for the government and had more than 600 of its employees enter the armed forces. At its height it manufactured nearly 2 million clocks and watches annually and employed over 4,000 persons. It closed the Peru factory in 1980; the loss of jobs caused a rapid decline in population in LaSalle and Peru.

Today the old Westclox Administration Building is now the headquarter for the Carus Corporation and the rest of the Westclox complex is being redeveloped into a commercial center. The building is also home to the Westclox Museum. The building caught fire on July 14, 2023.

==Geography==

As of 2021, Peru has a total area of , of which (or 98.68%) is land and (or 1.32%) is water.

Located on the Illinois River, Peru lies west of the intersection of two major interstate highways: Interstate 39 and Interstate 80. The city is also the western terminus of the historic Illinois and Michigan Canal. Before the Illinois Waterway was constructed, the Illinois River was navigable only up to Peru. Starved Rock State Park, a regional tourist attraction, is located south-east of the community. Peru has a twin city on its eastern edge, LaSalle.

Peru is the home of at least three very old companies. It is the national headquarters of American Nickeloid, started in 1898, and the W.H. Maze Co, dealing in lumber and nails, which started the year the Illinois and Michigan Canal opened in 1848. Maze Nails is one of America&#x27;s last remaining nail makers. Peru is home to the offices of Carus Chemical Company, started in 1915, today one of the largest manufacturers of potassium permanganate in the world.

In 2021, the DuPage Pistol Shrimp baseball team relocated from Lisle, Illinois to Peru, becoming the Illinois Valley Pistol Shrimp. The Pistol Shrimp are a member of the collegiate Prospect League.

<text>Ransom is a village in LaSalle County, Illinois, United States. The population was 308 at the 2020 census, down from 384 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Ottawa Micropolitan Statistical Area. It is part of the subregion known as &quot;Streatorland&quot;.

== History ==
Ransom was a planned community; ads were placed in the &quot;Streator Monitor&quot; as early as 1876 calling for shopkeepers, craftsmen, and tradesmen to locate and set up shop in the area. In 1885, the village of Ransom was officially incorporated. The earliest businesses in Ransom included a hotel, saloon, doctor, carpenter, pharmacist, grocery store, cash exchange and a blacksmith. On the edge of the newly developing business district a small wooden water tower was constructed. In 1892 a fire devastated the eastern side of the business district, stymieing the village&#x27;s growth and causing some business owners to close up shop forever.

After the fire, and much back and forth, the village constructed a new public waterworks with a 68 feet water tower at its center in 1896. The village flourished after the fire, eventually reaching a population peak of around 600 following World War II. On September 7, 1903, the first phone service reached Ransom, and AT&amp;T opened a telegraph office in 1905. Between 1905–1910 the village constructed a sidewalk system. The first electric street lamps appeared on May 7, 1910, with the acquisition of a dozen electric street lamps from Illinois Valley Gas and Electric. Electricity gradually made its way into the homes of Ransom following the introduction of the street lamps.

=== Namesake ===

<doc id="111443" wikidata="Q2672186" url="?curid=111443" title="Sheridan, Illinois">
<text>Sheridan is a village in LaSalle County, Illinois, United States. As of the 2020 census, the village&#x27;s population was 2,431, up from 2,137 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Ottawa Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Sheridan has a total area of , of which (or 98.29%) is land and (or 1.71%) is water.

The village lies at a bend in the Fox River where Somonauk Creek enters the river, and the Lower Fox River Dells start. It is used as both a launching and retrieval point for canoes going down the river. Canoes generally start upstream in Yorkville, and they generally exit at Ayers Landing, near the community of Wedron. The area of the village, and Mission Township where it sits, is defined by the river&#x27;s distinct westward flow, which goes west, then south, then east, then south, and finally winds west again. The unincorporated area of the village resides within the flood plain and valley north of the village, and is within Northville Township while the village itself sits far back from the river, upon a sandstone bluff, which has been mined for sand and gravel. The village&#x27;s &quot;Rod and Gun Club&quot; actually sits within one of the old open-pit mines between the village and the northern bridge.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 census there were 2,431 people, 403 households, and 281 families residing in the village. The population density was . There were 330 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the village was 48.66% White, 40.72% African American, 0.12% Native American, 0.16% Asian, 7.57% from other races, and 2.76% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 10.08% of the population.

There were 403 households, out of which 29.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 52.36% were married couples living together, 8.68% had a female householder with no husband present, and 30.27% were non-families. 25.31% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.70% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.00 and the average family size was 2.49.

The village&#x27;s age distribution consisted of 8.6% under the age of 18, 15.1% from 18 to 24, 50.5% from 25 to 44, 23.1% from 45 to 64, and 2.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34.5 years. For every 100 females, there were 477.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 693.3 males.

The median income for a household in the village was $70,925, and the median income for a family was $76,979. Males had a median income of $59,167 versus $23,750 for females. The per capita income for the village was $11,121. About 8.9% of families and 13.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 14.0% of those under age 18 and 19.0% of those age 65 or over.

The community is also currently the home to a medium-security prison for the State of Illinois.

The community is served by the Sheridan Community Fire Department and Sheridan Police Department. The school district that serves the area is CUSD #2, which serves the Communities of Serena, Sheridan, Harding, Norway, and Baker; Schools are only in Sheridan, Serena, and Harding, however, with the High School in Serena.

The mailing area of the community (the area with a Sheridan address) extends toward the communities of Newark, Millington, Norway, Serena, Somonauk, and Sandwich. Regarding to what reference is being consulted, the community of Norway and its environs are actually referred to as being Sheridan, or the nearby community of Serena.

==Flooding==

In 1996, a flood occurred after a heavy rain storm drenched the valley, from Aurora down to Dayton, resulting in the low-lying area of Sheridan to flood, and most notably, Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;Old Mill Inn&quot; became a popular spot for people to canoe from the bridge which came from town, to the Old Mill during the flood. In February 1998, the river flooded again after a rain storm failed to drain into the frozen ground. In 2008, the remnants of Hurricane Ike flooded the valley yet again. During the April 17–18, 2013 rain event, which flooded many bodies of water in the Chicago metropolitan area, the river and Somonauk Creek flooded, with much of the water level considerably diminished after it crested later that weekend. The river valley both north and west of Sheridan is somewhat confined by sandstone bluffs on either side, which forces the river to rise, resulting in higher river levels. The village itself is largely untouched, as a half-mile gap between the main area of town and the valley, coupled with two abandoned gravel quarry pits sitting within the gap, protects the town. The village also sits approximately 30 feet above the river.

==The Village of Sheridan, Incorporated 1872==

The Village of Sheridan was settled as early as 1833 when Robert Rowe and his wife settled on Section 5 and 8 in what is now Mission Township. Prior to this, in 1826 Jesse Walker established a mission at the head of Mission Creek, just three miles from the present town of Sheridan. He became the first white settler in what is now Mission Township. In 1834, a Cholera Epidemic swept through the community, with a cemetery South of town near the present day prison as proof of this event. In 1844 Mission Point was established with the vote for a President and Vice-President. Mission Point became known as Rowes Station in 1863, the Rowe farm consisted of three houses. Finally, in the summer of 1869 the village was platted and named Sheridan after General Phillip Sheridan. On June 24, 1872, the town of Sheridan voted forty-five to one to incorporate under the Old Statute of the State of Illinois. On June 29 of that same year, the first election of the Board of Trustees was held. The following seal was adopted: &quot;Town Seal, Sheridan, Illinois. Incorporated, June 29, 1872&quot;. The township&#x27;s first post office building actually resided on the property of a farm, located a mile east of town, off of E 2650th Road. The post office served the community until a Post Office was constructed in Sheridan, and the rest of the township was served either by the communities of Millington, Newark, Sheridan, Sandwich, or by rural routes.

As time progressed, the community grew, and the latter half of the 20th century saw expansive growth of local businesses, as there were a hardware store, two banks, a grocery store, two barber shops, two gas stations, three restaurants, and a tire center. However, over the subsequent years from 1995 to the present, many of the local businesses had either relocated or closed. Competition from nearby Ottawa, Sandwich, and Plano closed or diminished the ability to draw local residents to buying locally, resulting in local businesses having a hard time keeping business.

==Norway, Illinois==
The community of Norway sits to the south of Sheridan at the intersection of Illinois Route 71 and County Highway 3. Due to the community&#x27;s status as an unincorporated community in the State of Illinois, the community does not have a local government, fire district, school district, or local policing or postal services. Most of the services are provided by Sheridan, while the school district, (CUSD #2) serves the area, and the Serena Fire Protection District covers the community and has a small station located in Norway. Postal addresses are designated in Norway as either being Sheridan or Serena, since both communities have postal service, and both communities are no more than six miles away.

==Law and government==

===Townships===
The Village of Sheridan resides within two townships, Mission Township and Northville Township. The main area of town resides within Mission Township, while the periphery area of town extends to Northville Township in the north and west.

==Education==
The village is covered by Community Unit School District #2, which is based out of neighboring Serena. The school district was formed by the combination of Sheridan, Serena, and Harding Schools. Currently, Serena High School is the only high school in the district, while there are three elementary schools in the three communities of the district. Serena High School is in the Little Ten Conference of the IHSA Athletic Program. Sheridan had a high school until 1939, when Sheridan High School was closed to combine with Serena and Harding. Sheridan High School was a member of the Little Ten Conference between 1930 until the formation of District 2. Serena has been a member of the Conference since 1939.

==Infrastructure==

===Health systems===
Sheridan is served by two hospitals, Valley West Community Hospital, (formerly Sandwich Community Hospital, or SCH), run by Northwestern Medicine&#x27;s regional division, KishHealth, which is located in Sandwich, some six miles away, and also by OSF Saint Elizabeth Medical Center, (formerly Ottawa Regional and Community Hospital of Ottawa, or CHO), which is run by OSF Healthcare. There are higher-level trauma centers located in Aurora and Peoria.

==Transportation==
The Illinois Railway runs through the center of town. Sheridan is near a State Highway, and two US Highways. Two County Highways (C. R. 32 and C. R. 3) run through town, and another (C. R. 2) is a mile to the west of town.

* U.S. Highway 34 six miles to the north

<text>Streator is a city in LaSalle and Livingston counties in the U.S. state of Illinois. The city is situated on the Vermilion River approximately southwest of Chicago in the prairie and farm land of north-central Illinois. As of the 2020 census, the population of Streator was 12,500.
==History==

Although settlements had occasionally existed in the area, they were not permanent. In 1824, surveyors for the Illinois and Michigan Canal which would extend from Chicago&#x27;s Bridgeport neighborhood to the Illinois River, a tributary of the Mississippi River, arrived in this area of the Vermillion River, followed by homesteaders by the 1830s. In 1861, miner John O&#x27;Neill established a trading post called &quot;Hardscrabble&quot; (ironically an early name for the Bridgeport neighborhood), supposedly because he watched loaded animals struggle up the river&#x27;s banks. Another name for the new settlement was &quot;Unionville&quot;.

Streator received its current name to honor Worthy S. Streator, an Ohio industrialist who financed the region&#x27;s first coal mining operation. Streator received a town charter in 1868 and incorporated as a city in 1882. In 1882 Col. Ralph Plumb was elected as its first mayor. Streator&#x27;s early growth was due to the coal mine, as well as a major glass manufacturer and its status as a midwestern railroad hub. Today Streator&#x27;s economy is led by heavy-equipment manufacturer Vactor, food distributor U.S. Foodservice and glass bottle manufacturer Owens-Illinois.

The city is the hometown of Clyde Tombaugh, who in 1930 discovered the dwarf planet Pluto, the first object to be discovered in what would later be identified as the Kuiper belt; and George &quot;Honey Boy&quot; Evans, who wrote &quot;In the Good Old Summer Time.&quot; Streator hosts annual events including Streator Park Fest; an Independence Day celebration, the Roamer Cruise Night and the Light Up Streator celebration. Streator is governed by a Manager–council style of government. It maintains police and fire departments as well as a public works system. Its current mayor is Terra Bedi.

===Pre-settlement===
Settlement in the region began with the Kaskaskia tribe of the Illiniwek Confederation. This Native American tribe&#x27;s Grand Village was located on the north bank of the Illinois River in nearby Utica, Illinois. The Kaskaskia &quot;were hunters and gatherers, farmers, warriors and traders.&quot; The Illiniwek were the last remnants of the Mississippian culture.
French explorers Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet were the first Europeans to enter this region during a visit to the Grand Village in 1673. Marquette established a mission at the village in 1675. In 1679, French explorer Robert de LaSalle ordered a fortification to be built at the site that was later known as Starved Rock. Later that year Iroquois attacked the Kaskaskia village and the 8,000 villagers dispersed. The French and local tribes again fortified the village and created Fort St. Louis, but the Iroqouis continued to attack. The settlement was eventually abandoned by 1691.

In the years after the initial exploration, the French settled their newly claimed territory as La Louisiane. During much of the 18th century the region was sparsely populated by French, British and American fur traders. The French ceded control of the part of the La Louisiane territory east of the Mississippi River to the British at the end of the French and Indian War in 1763. Of this territory ceded by the French to Britain, the part extending down to the Ohio River was added to Britain&#x27;s Quebec Province when the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act in 1774. During the American Revolutionary War (1775–83), this region that had been added to Quebec was claimed by Virginia in 1778, after a victory over the British by George Rogers Clark at Kaskaskia; Virginia named the region Illinois County.

After the war, the area was included in the territory ceded by Britain to the United States under the Treaty of Paris (1783); in 1784, Virginia ceded its claim over Illinois County to the Congress of the Confederation of the United States. This area, south of what remained of Britain&#x27;s Quebec but north of the Ohio River, later became the Northwest Territory created by the Congress on July 13, 1787. From part of this Northwest Territory area, the Indiana Territory was formed by the United States Congress on July 4, 1800; from part of this Indiana Territory area, the Illinois Territory created by Congress on March 1, 1809; and from part of that Illinois Territory area, the state of Illinois was admitted to the union on December 3, 1818, by Congress.

The city of Chicago served as the main impetus of growth in the area throughout the early 19th century, and more importantly to the region around Streator was the development of the Illinois and Michigan Canal in 1821. This canal connected Lake Michigan to the Mississippi River, greatly increasing shipping traffic in the region. Land speculation in areas lining the canal and rivers ensued and towns sprouted quickly. Individual settlements in the Bruce Township region started as early as 1821. In 1861, John O&#x27;Neil established the first settlement in what was to become the city of Streator when he opened a small grocery and trading business.

===Coal and cityhood===
Streator began with coal. Vast beds of coal lie just beneath the surface throughout much of Illinois. The demand for coal was increasing in the mid-19th century, and East Coast capitalists were willing to invest in this region. The area was originally known as , &quot;because it was a hard scrabble to cross the Vermilion River and get up the hill to where the town was first located&quot;. The town was renamed Unionville in honor of the local men who fought for the Union during the Civil War.

In 1866 Worthy S. Streator, a prominent railroad promoter from Cleveland, Ohio, financed the region&#x27;s first mining operation. Streator approached his nephew Col. Ralph Plumb at a railway station in December 1865 about overseeing a mining operation in central Illinois for him and several investors. Colonel Plumb agreed and arrived in the town then called Hardscrabble in February 1866. Success of the project required a rail line near the mines. Plumb and Streator &quot;invited&quot; Streator&#x27;s friend, then Ohio Congressman James A. Garfield to sign on as an investor. In return, Garfield was expected to work with Robert C. Schenck, then the president of the American Central railroad, in getting the railroad to &quot;bend their lines&quot; to Streator. Eventually the plan did not work. The Vermilion Company then made arrangements with the Fox River line for their needed rail service.
Included in Col. Plumb&#x27;s duties were overseeing the platting and incorporation of the quickly growing area. Plumb served as Streator&#x27;s first mayor serving two terms. Plumb&#x27;s mark on the early development of Streator was notable. The main hotel and the local opera house bore his name. He financed the construction of the city&#x27;s first high school. Earlier in his life he served as an Ohio state representative and as an officer in the Union Army. Later in life he served Illinois as a representative in Congress.

Streator grew rapidly due to a number of factors: the need for coal in Chicago, the desire of European immigrants to come to America, and the investments made by East Coast capitalists willing to invest in coal operations. Plumb needed laborers for his mines, but the Vermilion Coal Company was unable to afford European employment agents. Instead, it alerted steamship offices of the new job opportunities and convinced local railroads to carry notices of Streator&#x27;s promise.
Land was sold to incoming miners at discounted prices as another enticement, but the company retained mineral rights to the land. In 1870, Streator&#x27;s population was 1,486, but by 1880 its population tripled.
Scottish, English, Welsh, German and Irish immigrants came to the area first, followed later by scores of mostly Slovaks; Czechs, Austrians and Hungarians came in lesser numbers.
Today many of the residents are direct descendants of these original miners.

The success of the local mining operations and the introduction of the new glass making industry allowed for improvements in the living conditions and personal wealth of its miners and laborers. An 1884 survey by the Illinois Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that 20 percent of Streator&#x27;s miners owned their houses. Labor movements like the Miners National Association and the United Mine Workers of America began to flourish, as did ethnic churches and social institutions such as the Masons and Knights of Pythias. In his 1877 &quot;History of LaSalle County&quot;, author H.F. Kett states:
Perhaps no city...in Illinois, outside of the great city of Chicago, presents an instance of such rapid and substantial growth as the city of Streator. From a single small grocery house... the locality has grown to be a city of 6,000 prosperous and intelligent people. Churches, school-houses, large, substantial business houses and handsome residences, with elegant grounds and surroundings, now beautify the waste of ten years ago, while the hum of machinery and thronged streets are unmistakable evidences of business importance and prosperity.
In addition to coal, the area around Streator contained rich clay and shale, which gave rise to Streator&#x27;s brick, tile and pipe industries. In time, these supplanted coal as Streator&#x27;s leading exports, but Streator was best known for its glass bottle industry. In the early 20th century Streator held the title of &quot;Glass Manufacturing Capital of the World.&quot; Streator continued to flourish for much of the early 20th century. Ultimately the demand for coal was replaced with the growing needs for gas and oil. Many of the underground mines in Streator closed during the 1920s. The last of the mines shut down in 1958. While other areas of LaSalle County continued to grow, Streator&#x27;s population peaked at about 17,000 residents in 1960 and has since declined. Many of the original downtown buildings have been demolished, but few have been replaced. Another reason for static growth in Streator is its distance from any major Interstate Highway. When the federal highway system started in the 1950s and 1960s no interstate was built near the city. Streator is from Interstate 55, from Interstate 80 and Interstate 39.

===2007 Comprehensive plan===
Streator and the North Central Illinois Council of Governments (NCICG) finalized the &quot;Streator Comprehensive Plan&quot; in February 2007. The plan if approved is a roadmap for civic, transportation, housing, commercial and recreational improvements in the city through 2027.

==Geography==
As of 2021, Streator has a total area of , of which (or 99.1%) is land and (or 0.9%) is water.

===Topography and geology===
Streator lies within the Vermilion River/Illinois River Basin Assessment Area (VRAA) defined by the watershed of the Vermilion River, a major tributary to the Illinois River in Central Illinois, an area of mostly flat prairie. The topography of the basin is a complex collection of buried valleys, lowlands and uplands carved by repeated episodes of continental glaciation.

Underneath the topsoil, the region&#x27;s bedrock contains vast amounts of coal. About 68% of Illinois has coal-bearing strata of the Pennsylvanian geologic period. According to the Illinois State Geological Survey, 211 billion tons of bituminous coal are estimated to lie under the surface, having a total heating value greater than the estimated oil deposits in the Arabian Peninsula. However, this coal has a high sulfur content, which causes acid rain. 

Streator&#x27;s coal mining history closely parallels Illinois&#x27;, with a great push in coal production from 1866 until the 1920s, when many of the mines closed. The low-sulfur coal of the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and the growing demands for oil caused a decline in demand for Streator&#x27;s high-sulfur coal.

The St. Peter Sandstone is an Ordovician formation in the Chazyan stage of the Champlainian series. This layer runs east–west from Illinois to South Dakota. The stone consists of 99.44% quartz or silicon dioxide (SiO2), which is used for the manufacture of glass. Its purity is especially important to glassmakers. Streator, which lies within outcrop area of the St. Peter sandstone formation, has mined this mineral since the late 19th century for use in its glass manufacturing industries.

===Climate===

Streator has a continental climate, influenced by the Great Lakes. Its average winter temperature is and its average summer temperature is .
Streator has an average annual rainfall of , with an annual snowfall of 22.0 in (55.88 cm). The highest temperature recorded in Streator was in July 1936. The lowest temperature recorded was in January 1985.

====1903 tornado====
An F3 tornado hit the west side of Streator on July 17, 1903, killing six people and injuring 30. Five people died when the grandstand of a racetrack, where they had taken shelter, collapsed.

====1951 flood====
The worst flood in Streator&#x27;s history occurred in 1951. The Vermilion River reached a flood level of .

====2010 tornado====
At approximately 8:50 pm (CST) on June 5, 2010, an EF2 tornado swept through southern Streator. The tornado initially touched down east of Magnolia, causing EF0 and EF1 damage as it traveled east. EF2 damage began as the tornado passed East 15th Road. No fatalities were reported, but there were reports of leveled houses and extensive damage throughout the area. The National Weather Service reported that there were two tornadoes. The second was reported to have touched down one mile west of Streator, with a base of 50 feet.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census there were 12,500 people, 5,762 households, and 2,949 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 6,009 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 80.94% White, 3.50% African American, 0.53% Native American, 0.62% Asian, 0.00% Pacific Islander, 5.81% from other races, and 8.60% from two or more races.

The average household size was 2.89 and the average family size was 2.10.

The city&#x27;s age distribution consisted of 20.0% under the age of 18, 10.7% from 18 to 24, 25.9% from 25 to 44, 24.4% from 45 to 64, and 19.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40.4 years. For every 100 females, there were 93.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.9 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $40,778, and the median income for a family was $59,266. Males had a median income of $44,976 versus $21,567 for females. The per capita income for the city was $25,818. About 17.9% of families and 21.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 40.0% of those under age 18 and 4.6% of those age 65 or over.

Streator is a principal city of the Ottawa Micropolitan Statistical Area, which was the tenth-most populous Micropolitan Statistical Area in the United States as of 2009. The small Livingston County portion of Streator is part of the Pontiac Micropolitan Statistical Area.

Historically, the population of LaSalle County has increased 75% between 1870 and 1990, while the statewide population has grown 350%.

==Economy==
Streator&#x27;s economic history has been tied with its natural resources. Coal was the initial catalyst of the city&#x27;s economy from 1866 until the late 1920s. As the community matured, silica deposits provided the resource for Streator&#x27;s next industry leader: glass-container manufacturing. While the coal industry eventually died, glass manufacturing remains a presence in Streator. Agriculture and related agri-business in the farmlands of LaSalle County and nearby Livingston County are also a strong influence in Streator&#x27;s economic engine. Though manufacturing provides the greatest share of earnings, the service industry now accounts for the largest share of jobs.

===Coal===
Coal production in LaSalle County and Illinois peaked in the 1910s. Wyoming&#x27;s Powder River Basin coal reserves, which contain a much lower sulphur content, were discovered in 1889, with full scale mining beginning in the 1920s.

===Glass manufacturing===
Glassmaking and, more specifically, glass blowing was a highly skilled craft. Most of America&#x27;s glassblowers came from Europe, or were trained there. Many of Streator&#x27;s immigrant coal miners were trained in glass blowing. High-grade silica, the main ingredient in glass was in abundance in the Streator region and nearby Ottawa. The combination of silica, coal to fire the furnaces and skilled craftsmen were a perfect match for Streator&#x27;s second major industry which began in 1887 with the Streator Bottle and Glass Company. Other companies like Thatcher Glass Manufacturing Corp (later Anchor Glass Containers) which began manufacturing milk bottles in 1909, the American Bottle Company in 1905, the Streator Cathedral Glass Company in 1890, Owens-Illinois and others soon followed. Through the 20th century Streator was known as the &quot;Glass Container Capital of the World.&quot;

===Major employers===
Three of Streator&#x27;s largest companies are some of its longest-lasting companies. Vactor Manufacturing began in 1911 as the Myers-Sherman Company, manufacturing milking machines and conveyors for the agricultural industry. In the 1960s Myers-Sherman patented a sewer cleaning vehicle for the municipal public works market. The company was renamed Vactor when it became a subsidiary of the Federal Signal Corporation They are the world&#x27;s leading producer of heavy-duty sewer cleaning equipment. They are the second-largest employer in Streator with 530 employees.

Owens-Illinois&#x27; Streator plant produces Duraglas XL bottles; a lightweight, stronger beer bottle for the Miller Brewing Company. Owens Bottle Company opened in Streator in 1916. Production peaked in the 1960s with 3,500 employees working in its facility. Today it is Streator&#x27;s fifth-largest employer, with 210 employees. In 2006, the plant was honored by the Miller Brewing Company for producing 650 million bottles for the brewer.

St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital is the city&#x27;s largest employer with 550 employees. In late 2015, OSF Healthcare system purchased the hospital from HSHS Medical Group. It is undetermined what OSF Healthcare will do with the hospital. Founded in 1886 by the Hospital Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis, this 251-bed hospital serves Streator and its outlying areas.

Streator was briefly home to the Erie Motor Carriage Company (which became Barley Motor Car Co.).
Current products of Streator include building and paving brick, milk, soda bottles, auto parts, sewer pipe, clothing, drain tile, auto truck dump bodies, and hydraulic hoists. Its major agricultural crops include corn and soybeans.

==Arts, culture and media==
Streator&#x27;s parks and events reflect its heritage and prairie locale. A number of its residents have distinguished themselves in the art world.

===Arts===
The Community Players of Streator offer summer stock theatre performances each year at the William C. Schiffbauer Center for the Performing Arts at Engle Lane Theatre.

 The Majestic Theatre, an art deco style movie house, originally opened in 1907 as a vaudeville house. It has gone through many changes, openings, and closings throughout its history, having most recently reopened in 2002. The Majestic shows recently released movies as well as hosting live musical acts. This has since closed due to deterioration.

The Walldogs painted 17 murals in the summer of 2018. The downtown now is home to more than 20 murals.

===Museums and historical buildings===


The Streatorland Historical Society Museum houses displays of Streator history and memorabilia of some of its famous citizens. One of the displays is a tribute to the Free Canteen. The Canteen was a group of local volunteers who served over 1.5 million soldiers during World War II who briefly stopped at the city&#x27;s old Santa Fe Train Depot while traveling by troop trains. Other features include a homemade telescope used by astronomer Clyde Tombaugh and a Burlington Northern caboose rail car.

During World War II the Streator Santa Fe Train Depot was a busy way-station for millions of soldiers and sailors who passed through the town on the way to or from training for the war. Beginning in 1943, the Streator Parents Service Club, a group of parents of veterans of the war, created the Streator Free Canteen. The volunteers handed out sandwiches and coffee and presented a friendly face to the servicemen during their stopover in Streator. During the 2½ years that the canteen operated, volunteers hosted over 1.5 million servicemen and women. Thirty other service groups from Streator joined to assist the Parents Service Club as well as 43 other organizations throughout the central-Illinois region. On Veterans Day, November 10, 2006, a bronze statue commemorating the &quot;Coffee Pot Ladies&quot; of Streator was dedicated at the Santa Fe Railroad Station.

The Streator Public Library was made possible with a $35,000 grant from Andrew Carnegie. With its two-story high domed ceiling, Ionic columns and oak staircases, it was considered too extravagant by critics when it opened in 1903. The Library was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. The Ruffin Drew Fletcher House located on East Broadway Street is an example of Stick style architecture. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in August 1991. The Silas Williams House is a Queen Anne style home built-in 1893. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in June 1976. Founded in 1883, St. Stephens Catholic Church was the first Slovak Catholic church in the United States. In September 2010, the four Roman Catholic churches in Streator were consolidated into one new parish named St. Michael the Archangel. Currently all masses are conducted at St. Stephen&#x27;s Church and discussions are continuing to decide if a new church will be built or if one of the existing churches will be rebuilt.

Among Streator&#x27;s other notable buildings are the ornate Bauhaus-inspired National Guard Armory near the Vermilion River and the town&#x27;s turn-of-the-20th-century City Hall on Park Street (now a business). These facilities are accessible to the public, with some limitations. Streator is also home to many private residences of significant historical interest and value, including the Kennedy Home on Pleasant Avenue.

===Events===
The Streator Food Truck Festival is held annually in May.

Park Fest is held during the Memorial Day weekend through Sunday. Park Fest activities are held in City Park (the main public park in the downtown Streator area).

A Memorial Day observance is held on the morning of Memorial Day at the Veterans Plaza at the southeast part of City Park.

Streator is a designated stop each year in the annual &quot;Heritage Tractor Adventure&quot; along the Illinois and Michigan Canal. This three-day tractor ride/rally attracts hundreds of antique tractor owners.

The annual Fourth of July celebration runs for over four days with events throughout the city, with most of the events held in City Park; the park-based events include a carnival, 5K run and a talent contest. Other Fourth of July events include the annual parade which runs through downtown and the fireworks display which is held at Streator High School.

&quot;Roamer Cruise Night&quot; is an annual cruise / car show held on Labor Day weekend in the downtown district that attracts over 600 cars and 18,000 attendees. Special features of the Cruise Night include a display of a Roamer which was built at a factory in Streator in 1917. Cruise Night was rained out in 2011 and 2012, leaving Streatorites hungry for 2013.

A Veterans Day observance is held on the morning of Veterans Day at Veterans Plaza.

Streator also has an annual event called Light Up Streator held the first Saturday after Thanksgiving. Light Up Streator is a group of volunteers who place holiday decorations throughout the Streator area, most notably in City Park.

The Keeping Christmas Close to Home Parade of Lights is held the weekend after Thanksgiving in downtown Streator.

===Media===
Streator has one daily newspaper, &quot;The Times&quot;. The daily paper, published by the Small Newspaper Group Inc., in nearby Ottawa, provides the local news for the Ottawa, IL Micropolitan Statistical Area. Streator&#x27;s original daily, &quot;The Times-Press News&quot; merged with the &quot;Ottawa Daily Times&quot; in 2005. Television broadcasts are provided by stations in nearby Bloomington and Peoria. Local cable providers also air Chicago stations. Streator has three local radio stations: WSPL 1250 AM, which has a news/talk format, WSTQ 97.7 FM, which has a contemporary pop format and WYYS 106.1 FM, which broadcasts a classic hits format. The three stations are owned by the Mendota Broadcast Group, Inc. One of the longest-running programs on WSPL was &quot;Polka Party&quot;, which was broadcast live on Saturday mornings for more than thirty years until its host Edward Nowotarski retired in 2001.

==Parks and recreation==

The city of Streator maintains eight local parks and one public golf course.

Spring Lake Park is a city-owned park west of the Streator city limits (and north of Illinois Route 18). The park has two creeks, waterfalls and six trails. It offers hiking, horseback riding and picnicking. In September 2008, Spring Lake Park received the Governor&#x27;s Hometown Award from the state of Illinois in recognition of its volunteer-led restoration project.

City Park is the main park in Streator&#x27;s downtown area; a section of Streator City Park called Veterans Plaza contains memorials bearing the names of citizens who gave their lives for their country in the Civil War and in later wars. The park is also home to the Reuben G. Soderstrom Plaza, a monument dedicated to former Illinois AFL-CIO President and Streator native Reuben Soderstrom. City Park is the site of annual events including Streator Park Fest (successor to Heritage Days), held on Memorial Day weekend; the Roamer Cruise Night, held on Labor Day weekend; and the annual Light Up Streator celebration and display held each November. Patriotic observances use the park&#x27;s Veterans Plaza on Memorial Day and Veterans Day. The park is also the site of other events, including concerts. In 2012 construction began, in the southwest quadrant of City Park, on a new venue suitable for concerts; it was later announced that this would be called Plumb Pavilion (in honor of Streator&#x27;s first mayor, Ralph Plumb).

Marilla Park, located at the northeast end of Streator, is among Streator&#x27;s larger parks, and includes picnic areas and a playground area. In 2012, a Disc Golf Course was added to Marilla Park.

Other city parks in Streator include Oakland Park, Central Park, Bodznick Park, Merriner Park, and Southside Athletic Park.

In 1913, The Streator Boosters were in fourth place with a 30–57 record, and in 1914 the Boosters had a record of 40–48, again finishing in fourth place. The Streator Boosters competed in the Bi-State League in 1915. When the league disbanded in the middle of the season, the Streator Boosters were in first place with a record of 30 wins and 18 losses.

In 2008, the Streator Reds, an age 16-and-under team, won the Senior League Illinois State Tournament defeating the team from Burbank, Illinois. The Reds then qualified for the Senior League Regional Tournament in Columbia, Missouri, where they were eliminated in the first round with a 2–2 record.

Three local residents have had notable success in professional sports. Doug Dieken played 14 seasons for the Cleveland Browns in the National Football League from 1971 to 1984. He was selected to the Pro Bowl in 1980, and named a &quot;Cleveland Brown Legend&quot; by the team in 2006. He serves as a color commentator on Browns radio broadcasts. Bob Tattersall (1924–1971) was known as the &quot;King of Midget Car Racing&quot; in the 1950s and 1960s in both the US and Australia. Tattersall had a long list of victories, including the 1960, 1962, 1966 and 1969 Australian Speedcar Grand Prix (Midgets are known as Speedcars in Australia), while his crowning achievement was when he won the 1969 USAC National Midget Series. He died of cancer at his home in Streator in 1971. Also, in 2009, Clay Zavada, made his professional debut as a relief pitcher for the Arizona Diamondbacks. Other local residents who have enjoyed careers in Major League Baseball include Andy Bednar (pitcher, Pittsburgh Pirates), Rube Novotney (catcher, Chicago Cubs) and Adam Shabala (outfielder, San Francisco Giants).

The Streator 10-year-old All-Stars took home the city&#x27;s first Little League State Baseball Championship in 2002 versus Chicago(Ridge Beverly). After winning district and sectional championships, the state tournament finals was held in Utica, Illinois. The 12-year-old team from Streator competed in the World Series in 2012.

===Outdoor recreation===
Outdoor recreation activities in the Streator area primarily center around the Vermilion River, Spring Lake Park (Located on the west side of the city) and nearby state parks. Fishing, kayaking and canoeing are popular activities along the Vermilion River. Matthiessen State Park and Starved Rock State Park offer hiking, hunting, camping and other amenities in their geologically diverse areas.

==Law and government==

One of the first Presbyterian churches in the county was founded here in 1849 with a congregation of just 8 members. A gristmill was constructed in 1861

<text>Antioch is a village in Lake County, Illinois, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 14,622. The village is nestled into the Chain O&#x27;Lakes waterway system and borders the state of Wisconsin. Part of the Chicago metropolitan area, Antioch is located approximately halfway between the major cities of Chicago (60 miles south) and Milwaukee (50 miles north).

==History==
=== Native American history ===
The Pottawatomi Tribe historically inhabited in the area of present-day Antioch prior to European settlement. The tribe was pushed to the west by European/American encroachment in the 1830s although remnants can still be found today.

===European settlement===
The first permanent European settlements in the region were along the creek, named as &quot;Sequoit&quot; which means &quot;winding&quot;. Darius and Thomas Gage brothers built the first cabin. After building a sawmill by Hiram Buttrick on Sequoit Creek, a tributary of the Fox River, the region became a center of commerce. In 1843, new settlers gave a biblical name &quot;Antioch&quot; to the region and started a school. The town grew as new settlers, primarily of English and German descent, established farms and businesses. In 1976, a replica of Buttrick&#x27;s mill was built a few hundred feet downstream from where it once stood. Today, many local businesses and organizations as well as Antioch Community High School use the name &quot;Sequoit&quot;.

Partly due to being a regional center of the abolitionist movement, Antioch is noted as having sent a disproportionately high number of its young men to the Union Army. By the late 1800s, Antioch became a popular vacation spot for Chicagoans and tourism grew quickly once the rail line to Chicago was laid in 1886. Fire destroyed much of downtown in 1891, 1903, and 1904. During Prohibition, Al Capone owned a summer home on nearby Bluff Lake. Following World War II, Antioch continued to see a steady population and economic increase, and an industrial park was created in the 1970s.

Today, Antioch serves as a bedroom community within the Chicago metropolitan and Milwaukee metropolitan area.

<text>Bannockburn is a village in West Deerfield and Vernon townships in Lake County, Illinois, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 1,013. The village is generally considered part of the Chicago area&#x27;s North Shore region. The Friedman house by Frank Lloyd Wright is located in Bannockburn.

Bannockburn was founded by Scottish real estate developer William Aitken, who planned a community of &quot;country estates&quot; on in inland Lake County. Named for the Scottish village of Bannockburn, the village began construction in 1924 and was incorporated in 1929. Aitken designed his development for the affluent members of his bridge and country club. His plan for Bannockburn featured large lots to imitate country living, and this design has been preserved; in fact, the original minimum on home lots has been increased to two.

Gradually, Bannockburn expanded its boundaries to its current . The Tri-State Tollway was built through the village in the 1950s, encouraging growth, though traffic noise pollution has been a persistent local concern. In the late 1960s Bannockburn&#x27;s citizens, after some debate, approved the construction of the first of several business parks along the village&#x27;s northern edge. It created its first commercial zone in 1984 along Illinois Route 22. Bannockburn&#x27;s municipal services expanded slowly in an effort to limit taxes, but it established a police department in the 1970s and built a village hall in 1992.

==Illinois Beach State Park==
Beach Park is the home to the South Beach section of Illinois Beach State Park, which is otherwise located in Winthrop Harbor. The beach was originally part of Camp Logan, a rifle range developed by the Illinois National Guard in 1892. In World War I and World War II it served as a rifle range for the Great Lakes Naval Training Station. The range remained in operation until 1973, when it was transferred to the Illinois Department of Conservation. In 1950, the Illinois Dunes Preservation Society was established to maintain the natural qualities of the beach. With the help of the Illinois Department of Conservation the area south of Beach Road was established as the state&#x27;s first natural preserve. The northern beach, between Beach Road and the Wisconsin state border, was obtained between 1971 and 1982.

The south beach is now home of the Illinois Beach Resort and Conference Center. The North Point Marina is at the north beach. This is Illinois&#x27; newest and largest marina and the largest freshwater marina in the United States.

More than 650 species of plants have been recorded in the dunes area alone, including dozens of types of colorful wildflowers.

On May 9, 2000, the area encompassing Illinois Beach State Park and North Point Marina was officially designated as the Cullerton Complex in honor of William J. Cullerton, Sr., war hero, avid environmentalist and long-time friend of conservation.

== Schools ==
Beach Park School District #3 schools are Beach Park Middle School, Howe Elementary, Kenneth Murphy Elementary, Newport Elementary, and Oak Crest Elementary. Our Lady of Humility School is a Catholic school that opened in 1958. High School age students typically attend Zion-Benton Township High School.

==Public safety==
The village of Beach Park is policed by the Lake County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. The village has contracted with the Sheriff&#x27;s Office to provide additional Deputy Sheriff personnel to patrol the village during the day. These deputies are able to call on the resources of multiple deputies, and the members of the Zion, Waukegan and Gurnee police departments should an emergency require it. The village has allowed the deputies to use the Village Hall as a small sub-station, which limits the time deputies are out of the area. Previously, the deputies had to return to Waukegan or Libertyville for paperwork issues.

Beach Park is provided fire and EMS protection 24/7 by the Beach Park Fire Protection District, the Winthrop Harbor Fire Protection District and the Newport Township Fire Protection District . The Beach Park Fire Protection District provides 90% of the village with fire and EMS services. (Consolidation of the Beach Park Fire Department and Zion Fire Department are underway, changing these demographics over the 2019 census year) All three districts, have signed Auto Aid Agreements with each other which is assistance dispatched automatically by contractual agreement between two communities or fire districts.

In early 2006, the Beach Park Fire Protection District received voter support for a nominal tax increase. This increase made full-time firefighter/paramedics a reality. The department was also able to lower the Insurance Services Organization (ISO) rating to a 3. This is one of the lowest in the area and saves residents on homeowners and renter&#x27;s insurance. The Beach Park Fire Department is taking positive steps by replacing older fire equipment. This will ensure that the residents receive good fire response by newer apparatus.

All departments which provide fire and emergency medical services are part of the MABAS Mutual Aid program. This program, funded by member agencies, provides assistance from the local region all the way to national resources.

==Transportation==
Pace provides bus service on multiple routes connecting Beach Park to downtown Waukegan and other destinations.

The Chicago &amp; North Western had a station at Dunes Park until 1953.

<text>Fox Lake is a village in Lake County, Illinois and Burton Township, McHenry County, Illinois, United States. Fox Lake is a northwestern Chicago suburb. The population was 10,978 at the 2020 census. It is located 50 miles north of Chicago.

==History==

The village was incorporated on December 15, 1906, and certified by the state on April 13, 1907. The area was first explored during the 17th century by the French. In the late 19th century, it was known as Nippersink Point. Early in the 20th century, there were but a few hundred residents. During the summer season, however, the population would reach an estimated 20,000 people, and at its peak, the area had 50 hotels and 2,000 cottages. Infamous Chicago gangster Al Capone is reported to have utilized an establishment now known as the Mineola Hotel and Restaurant as a hideout, although this has never been documented. Fox Lake is known to still have ties to mob activity. In 1979, the Mineola was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and may be the largest wooden frame structure in the state.

Many Chicagoans have established summer homes in Fox Lake. The village is situated among the Chain O&#x27;Lakes, where swimming, boating, jet skiing, tubing and boarding are popular activities. In 2006, there were an estimated 28,000 boats registered on the lake system.

Boating accidents are prevalent in today&#x27;s society, however, number of accidents on Fox Lake have decreased in part to stricter regulations on boating under the influence of alcohol and other factors. Fiscal year 2010 had only one accident and death by boat. That number rose in 2015 to 3 accidents, 1 injury and 1 death. The two fatalities in 2015 were caused by drowning due to alcohol use.

In 2010, the new library opened next to the old library building. The new facility included expanded Adult and Youth Departments, a large public computer area, quiet study and reading rooms, and a Young Adult area.

Fox Lake came under the national spotlight in September 2015 when Joe Gliniewicz of the Fox Lake Police Department was found deceased in a marsh via gunshot wounds after radioing that he was pursuing three subjects. The subsequent manhunt for the alleged shooters employed over 400 law enforcement personnel, impacted the entire local community, and sparked a debate in the media regarding the &quot;War on Cops&quot; and the Black Lives Matter movement. Thousands of people, including then-Governor Bruce Rauner, gathered for a funeral and memorial procession to show their support. After a two-month investigation, authorities concluded that Gliniewicz committed &quot;a carefully staged suicide&quot;. It was learned that he had been involved in financial malfeasance related to his job as the head of the local Police Explorers program and had even attempted to hire a gang member to kill the village administrator who he was concerned would discover his crimes during her financial audit of the program.

==Village government==
&quot;Fox Lake incorporated under a Village form of government, with an elected village president, six trustees, and a village clerk. The village president is also recognized as the mayor.&quot; The table below is a list of mayors from the village&#x27;s inception in 1907 to present.

<text>Fox River Grove (FRG) is a village in Algonquin Township, McHenry County and Cuba Township, Lake County, Illinois, United States. As per 2020 census, the population was 4,702. In 1919, the village of Fox River Grove was officially incorporated, becoming the ninth village in McHenry County. The Grove is situated along the southern shore of the Fox River.

==History==
===Indigenous peoples===

Long before the arrival of Europeans, Native Americans called the land within Fox River Grove home. The Ojibwe (also known as Chippewa) people continued to winter in the Fox River Valley into the 1860s. The women traded beadwork and purses with local settlers while the men trapped muskrat and mink, selling the pelts in nearby Barrington, Illinois. The area&#x27;s proximity to Northwest Highway (Route 14), a major military and trade road, enabled such commerce to thrive. The men also made fence posts for local farmers and would &quot;spear fish at night using torches attached to the ends of their birchbark canoes.&quot; When spring came, they traveled north to their summer lands in Wisconsin. Between 1816 and 1833, the Ojibwe and U.S. governments engaged in peace talks, resulting in several land cession treaties being signed. Eventually, the federal government took control of all Ojibwe land in Illinois. The rapid increase of European-American settlers, coupled with pressures from the government and military, eventually forced this dynamic and proud people to leave the lands that would soon become the FRG and relocate west of the Mississippi River.

===Czech heritage===
Pioneers built homesteads in the Fox River Valley between 1830 and 1860. They were originally drawn to the area that would become Fox River Grove for its scenery and abundance of water. Some of the first settlers to call the Grove home were Czechoslovakian immigrants who—by way of Chicago—established a Bohemian enclave along the Fox River. Attracted to the area for its prime fishing spots and access to 19th-century entertainment venues, Czechs built cottages among the village&#x27;s hills and on the river&#x27;s southern bank.

In 1850, ethnic-Czech, Frank Opatrny purchased of land on the southern shore of the Fox River. Considered to be the patriarch of the village&#x27;s founding family, Frank&#x27;s son Eman Opatrny put FRG on the map by turning his homestead into the regionally known Picnic Grove.
The Czech community established St. John&#x27;s Nepomucene Catholic Church and Cemetery on the southwest fringe of Fox River Grove in 1861. Named after a patron saint of Bohemia, the sanctuary&#x27;s construction began in 1871 and was finished in 1874. Because of the church&#x27;s small congregation, St. John&#x27;s did not support a resident priest. Instead, a Chicago-based priest would visit the congregation once a year; for the rest of the year, Bohemian-speaking members of the church would conduct services. While St. John&#x27;s stopped hosting worship services in 1914, the cemetery remains open to this day.

In 1900, Edward and Francis Konopasek (a Czech couple after whom one FRG&#x27;s wards is named) built the Grove&#x27;s first hotel—the Hotel Fox—and established a taxi service that shuttled notables like the Chicago Mayor Anton J. Cermak and Illinois Attorney General Otto Kerner Sr. from the nearest train stations to the Grove.

FRG was once also home to a Czech-styled castle replete with 100 stained glass windows. It was built by John Legat Sr. in 1920, but most of the castle is now dismantled.

===Resort town period===
Starting in the mid-nineteenth century, Czech immigrants transformed the Grove from a backwater pioneer settlement into a resort town. Chicagoans were attracted to the Grove&#x27;s waterfront and surrounding hilly woodlands. Staying in establishments such as the Hotel Fox, Chicagoans traveled to the Grove via the Illinois &amp; Wisconsin Railroad station and livery bus shuttle in neighboring Cary, Illinois.

===Picnic Grove heyday===
In 1899, Eman Opatrny bought his father Frank&#x27;s homestead and converted it into picnicking grounds. Known as the Fox River Picnic Grove, this large swath of land housed picnic plots (including sheltered areas), a shooting gallery, a horse track, six bars, a boathouse, boat docks, a dancing platform, a restaurant, a photo gallery, rowboat rentals, a bowling alley, a railroad spur track, a steam-powered excursion boat, and baseball diamonds. Trainloads of pleasure-seekers would pour into the park for weekend getaways. Opatrny also built many cottages near the river&#x27;s edge.

The Picnic Grove suffered a major blow in 1918 during a fire; most of the attractions from the early 1900s were lost. In 1942, Louis Jr. and Clara Cernocky purchased the Picnic Grove. The couple added more amenities, including a new dance pavilion, an air-conditioned cocktail lounge, and a 300-foot sandy beach. It fell into disarray in the 1960s. The Grove Marina, opened in 1961, was an entertainment center that included a restaurant and a cocktail lounge with live entertainment, but was destroyed by yet another fire in the mid-1970s. The Village of Fox River Grove obtained a grant to acquire along the river in 1994, naming the property &quot;Picnic Grove Park&quot;; the rest of the land not purchased by the village was sold to subdivision developers.

===Other resort-era establishments===
Besides the Picnic Grove, FRG welcomed the addition of a luxury hotel in 1902. Christened as the Castle Pavilion and Resort Hotel, the establishment had windows displayed during Chicago&#x27;s 1893 Columbian Exposition, the area&#x27;s first player piano, and a dance floor. During the 1910s, the Castle Pavilion even showed motion pictures, a novelty at the time. 

In 1905, a group of ethnically-Norwegian men from Chicago established the Norge Ski Club in FRG. Utilizing its three ski jumps, the club hosts international competitions during the winter months. The Norge Ski Club is the oldest continuously open ski club in the United States. During the spring and summer, snow is substituted by plastic tarps that are laid along the jumps. In the colder months, snow machines are employed to ensure that the slopes have a continual dusting of snow. In 2018, three of its members were named to the men&#x27;s U.S. Olympic ski jump team. In 2022, three of its members were named to the men&#x27;s U.S. Olympic ski jump team.

Although it no longer stands, Fox-River Grove Inn - Louie&#x27;s Place was an FRG mainstay for years. Built by Louis Cernocky Sr. at the corner of Northwest Highway and Lincoln Avenue, the establishment became a watering hole for many prominent Chicago residents and several notorious gangsters. Louie&#x27;s Place also housed the Crystal Ballroom, an eight-sided dance hall built in 1923 where big-bands—including Glenn Miller, Coon-Sanders, Wayne King, Louis Panico, Fred Waring, Frankie Masters, Art Kassel, and Guy Lombardo—entertained patrons. In 1921, Cernocky added a retail section to the building, and in 1922 the plot of land was subdivided and named Cernocky&#x27;s Subdivision of Block 12. In 1939, a suspicious fire broke out in the ballroom. A week later, four men saturated the ballroom with kerosene while their other two counterparts abducted the night watchman and a visiting fire marshall. These strange vandals fled by car towards Barrington, as their two planted bombs detonated at the scene of the crime. On the lam, the criminals released their captives near Palatine, Illinois. Although the explosions&#x27; resulting fire gutted the ballroom, the roof and the adjoining shops survived. The ballroom was repaired, but strangely enough, it never reopened for dancers. 

In 1931, Theodore &quot;Teddy&quot; Bettendorf began work on what would come to be known as Castle Vianden, which is located along what is now U.S. Route 14. Being an immigrant from Vianden, Luxembourg, Teddy spent 36 years building his castle in the Luxembourgian style. By 1960, the castle, which was open to visitors, had eight towers, a guard room, bugle tower, castle yard, enclosed sun porch, modern kitchen, garage, dungeon, and a wishing well. Bettendorff continued to add to his castle until his death in 1967. During the 1970s, the castle was rented out as a honeymoon retreat. The castle remains a private residence, but recently the owners of the property have been engaged in an ongoing effort to reopen the property for public enjoyment.

In 1945, Fox River Grove established the first VFW post in McHenry County.

The Barberry Hills Ski Area—a ski hill complete with two rope tows, a vertical drop of 145 feet, and a ski shop—was established in the early 1960s. While the rope tows and shop are now defunct, the hill itself is still a destination for sledding in winter.

===Gang-related activity===

During the Prohibition Era, Fox River Grove hosted a number of Chicago area crime syndicates. From bottom-rung bootleggers to the ringleaders themselves, gangsters of all stripes staked out the Grove for both business and merry-making. Located on the Fox River, the Grove served as a smuggling hub, with its waterways providing a transportation route. At the same time, the village&#x27;s small and relatively remote nature helped to shelter gang activity from the Chicago Police Department and federal authorities. Above all, however, this criminals&#x27; playground was only made possible by Louis Cernocky Sr., a local legend to this day. Cernocky&#x27;s property assets throughout FRG—along with his double-life stature as both a respected citizen and Capone gang bootlegger—allowed the operation to flourish. Thanks to Cernocky, outlaws prowled the Fox River banks and frequented Cernocky&#x27;s local establishments such as the Crystal Ballroom at Louie&#x27;s Place—a multi-use establishment that served as a restaurant, big-band dance hall, speakeasy, and gangster hideout. Importantly, members of the Dillinger Gang and Barker-Karpis Gang were regulars. Notable gangster visitors to Louie&#x27;s Place included Alvin &quot;Creepy&quot; Karpis, &quot;Ma&quot; Barker, Freddie Barker, &quot;Baby Face&quot; Nelson, John Dillinger, Homer Van Meter, and Tommy Carroll. The Grove was finally released from the gangsters&#x27; grasp in 1934. Having already neutralized Dillinger in Chicago, federal agents pursued and fatally shot Baby Face Nelson on nearby Route 14 in The Battle of Barrington. With most of the ringleaders dead or behind bars, the Grove&#x27;s gangster era soon came to an end.

===Suburban growth===
During the economic prosperity of the 1990s, Fox River Grove experienced a housing boom. In 1994, 6 out of 7 of the village&#x27;s trustees voted to allow a luxury housing development to be built on within the Picnic Grove—a stretch of land straddling the banks of the Fox River. Despite having the support of the Board of Trustees, the decision was deemed controversial by many members of the community. The housing development was built, with requirements for developers including mandatory public space creation, specified amounts of money given to the local library and school districts, and the compulsory replacement of trees chopped down in the wake of new development.

===Level crossing accident===

On October 25, 1995, a Metra passenger train, running express towards Chicago, collided with a Cary-Grove High School school bus, killing seven high school students. The accident brought reform and increased safety standards nationwide for signaled rail crossings located near street and highway intersections which are regulated by traffic signals, also known as interconnected crossings.

===21st century===
On August 21, 2019, Fox River Grove celebrated its 100th anniversary. To celebrate the centennial, the village hosted historical tours, a carnival, and a parade during the summer of 2019.

As of December 2019, FRG has become a debt-free village. According to Village President Nunamaker, this was attained through &quot;the accumulation of operational cost savings over the past several years and fiscally responsible decision making by the village board.&quot;

==Geography==
Fox River Grove is located primarily in McHenry County and partially in Lake County, along US 14, northwest of Chicago.

Moreover, over 87% of the village&#x27;s workforce are employed in white-collar positions such as managers, office workers, and salespeople. The village itself has a nearly non-existent industrial sector, meaning that most of the population works outside of city limits. That being said, just over 10% of the workforce telecommutes.

==Government and amenities==
The Village of Fox River Grove is classified as a non-home rule municipality. It is led by a Village President who is elected for a four-year term without term limits. The current Village President is Marc McLaughlin.

In 1936 the FRG Library Board was established. The building&#x27;s front facade is surrounded by a wall of rock slabs, erected in honor of the victims of the 1995 bus-train collision.

==Education==
===Elementary and Middle School===
The majority of children in the village are serviced by Fox River Grove School District #3. This district is made up of two schools: Algonquin Road Elementary School and Fox River Grove Middle School.

Algonquin Road Elementary School (colloquially known as ARS) provides a Kindergarten through 4th-grade educational curriculum with a 12:1 student-teacher ratio. In 2019, 52% of ARS students were deemed &quot;proficient&quot; in math, and only 47% tested at or above Illinois&#x27;s set proficiency level in reading.
Two hundred and five students in 5th through 8th grade attended Fox River Grove Middle School (FRGMS) in 2019. 53% of FRGMS students were proficient in math in 2019, and 55% were proficient in reading. The middle school&#x27;s student-to-teacher ratio was 14:1.

===High schools===
Most students in the village attend Cary-Grove Community High School located across the Fox River in neighboring Cary.

==Parks and recreation==


Over in Fox River Grove are classified as public parks and open space. Between the village&#x27;s 11 parks, access to playgrounds, basketball and volleyball courts, Port-A-Johns, sledding hills, baggo (cornhole) sets, soccer and baseball fields, picnic areas, fishing spots, hiking areas, and an ice-skating area are made available to residents and visitors.

The village&#x27;s small size has inhibited it from being able to support an official park district, so recreational activities are planned and administered by the volunteer-run Fox River Grove Rec Council. Sporting opportunities offered by the Council include a men&#x27;s basketball league, an adult volleyball league, and a youth soccer program. Youth baseball, softball, and basketball leagues are administered by Cary-Grove organizations.

During the annual Fireworks Celebration (always on the Saturday after the 4th of July), Fox River Grove shoots off fireworks from Picnic Grove Park. Also in July, Picnic Grove Park serves as the &quot;battlefield&quot; for the Fox River Grove Fire District&#x27;s water fights.

The FRG Rec Council hosts its annual Fox Chase 5K in Stanger Park. A youth mile alternative is offered for youngsters.

Lions Park, on the Fox River, provides scenic views of Cary. This waterside park is the site of Lions Fest, a yearly September festival in which Fox River Grove residents gather to converse and eat roasted corn. The lesser-known Arts &amp; Crafts Fair is also hosted at Lions Park each July. In 2019, the village celebrated its centennial. The highlight of this celebration was a temporary carnival installed at Lions Park.

==Environmental concerns==
Much of the Grove is located within the Fox River&#x27;s floodplain. As a result, waterfront properties in the village are at risk of flooding. Seasonal rains in the spring and summer often wash over the backyards and parks that line the river, resulting in property damage, erosion, and the spreading of trash and pollutants from the river onto land. In order to stymie erosion in 2020, the village dumped loads of rocks along a 500-foot stretch of riverbank in Picnic Grove Park. Some residents voiced concern that this would destroy the silty bank used by children as a beach; however, it was determined that covering the beach with stone was a necessary move to make in order to preserve the shoreline.

==Business==

Built in 1924, King Pin Lanes became the first bowling alley to open in McHenry County.

In 2012, the village legalized slot machines. There are two shopping centers: Stone Hill Center and Foxmoor Crossing. The centers contain several stores and chain restaurants typical of American suburbs. In 2020, a Culver&#x27;s replaced Mr. Beefy&#x27;s hot dog shack on Northwest Highway.

==Transportation==
The main artery running through Fox River Grove is U.S. Route 14, also known as Northwest Highway. Those traveling north on Route 14 can access the cities of Cary, Crystal Lake, and Woodstock; cities along Route 14 found south of the village include Barrington, Palatine, Arlington Heights, Mount Prospect, Des Plaines, Park Ridge, and Chicago. Illinois Route 22 also passes through FRG, connecting the village to North Barrington, Lake Zurich, Long Grove, Lincolnshire, the Tri-State Tollway, Bannockburn, and Highland Park. Moreover, Algonquin Road allows quick access to the villages south of FRG including Algonquin, Lake in the Hills, and Carpentersville. FRG residents can make use of the MCRide system, a dial-a-ride service that offers rides between several McHenry County municipalities.

FRG has one Metra station along the Union Pacific Northwest line which connects Harvard, Illinois to Chicago&#x27;s Ogilvie Transportation Center. Non-express trips between the village Metra station and Chicago take about 70 minutes.

==Sport==
In 2017 Norge Ski Club ski jumpers Kevin Bickner and Casey Larson qualified for the Olympic team based on their performances in the World Cup, while Michael Glasder qualified by winning the Olympic Trial in Park City, Utah on December 31. The three jumpers from Norge Ski Club constituted 3/4 of the Men&#x27;s Olympic Ski Jumping team in 2018, which made U.S. Olympic history by marking the first time three men from the same ski club represented the United States in ski jumping at the games.

<text>Gages Lake is a census-designated place (CDP) in Warren Township, Lake County, Illinois, United States. The population was 10,637 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The body of water known as Gages Lake was estimated to have formed nearly 10,000 years ago during the most recent ice age. 

In 1838 a schoolhouse was built in the area that would in time become Warren Township High School in 1917. In the 1840s a man known as John Gage and his brother George Gage began sellings parcels of land surrounding the lake which he called the North Grange Resort. Sometime prior to the developments in the 1920s, Richard Warren Sears (no relation to the name of the township) had purchased and owned the lake/surrounding land.
The census-designated place has received fire and police service from the neighboring village of Grayslake since the 1960s.

As part of the Wildwood Park District, in the 1970s the Gages Lake Conservation Committee (GLCC) was formed which still exists to this day.

<text>Grandwood Park is a census-designated place (CDP) in Warren Township, Lake County, Illinois, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 5,297.

==History==
Before the Industrial Revolution had made its way to the western Great Lakes, the land remained in the hands of the Potawatomi until the 1833 Treaty of Chicago. Small farm families dotted the land for several decades until 1873, of which a train station was built along the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad in the neighboring village (once an unincorporated area) of Gurnee. This over time caused an increase in the local population.

One of the earliest accounts of an individual living in the immediate community was a farmer in 1941. This farmer is credited for constructing a dam that barred Mill Creek and consequently formed Grandwood Lake that same year.

Development of the area began in the early 1960s and it started to receive fire and police support from Gurnee. The Grandwood Park Civic Association was established in 1962.

The Grandwood Park Park District was established in 1965. It acts as a municipal governing agency providing parks, recreation facilities, and events/programs for residents.

===Des Plaines River Flood of 2017===
After heavy rains in Grandwood Park and surrounding areas of Warren Township, in July, 2017, the dam barring Mill Creek to Grandwood Lake partially failed. Flooding averaging a foot in depth consumed adjoining Lake Park and nearby residences. For two weeks following the incident a variety of fish were found swimming on the park grounds and in yards, notably grass carp. Road closures were lifted on the 25th of July.

It was decided that same season that a new dam would ultimately be necessary. It would have to wait until 2019 when the lake was drained and a new concrete and steel dam was built. Original estimates for the project were between $900,000 and $1.7 million. The official number was never released. During a Board of Commissioners session on February 8, 2023, it was proposed that an electric light should be added to Lake Park in order to illuminate the dam. The estimated cost is $2,150.

===Post - 2020===

In 2020 the original bridge built across Mill Creek along North Hutchins Road in 1969, along with the culvert, were dismantled and rebuilt. Traffic was rerouted for nearly four months until the bridge was comepleted on June 18. The estimate price of the project was $1.46 million.

==Public Transport==

Pace Bus - Route 565 runs along Grand Avenue between Waukegan&#x27;s Metra Station and the College of Lake County in Grayslake. Seven stops are offered alongside the neighborhood.

==Geography==
The community is in north-central Lake County, in the northwestern part of Warren Township. It is bordered to the north by the village of Old Mill Creek, to the west by Lindenhurst, and to the south and east by Gurnee. U.S. Route 45 runs along the west side of the CDP, leading south to Mundelein and north to Bristol, Wisconsin. Illinois Route 132 forms the southern boundary of the CDP; it leads east to Gurnee and northwest to Lindenhurst. Exit 8 on Interstate 94 is east of Grandwood Park on Route 132, north of downtown Chicago.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Grandwood Park CDP has a total area of , of which , or 1.22%, are water. Grandwood Lake is a small impoundment on Mill Creek in the center of the community.
