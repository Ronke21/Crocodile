<text>Hawthorne () is a city in Alachua County, Florida, United States, incorporated in 1881. Indigenous peoples of the Americas had been living in the area since around 100 CE; Hawthorne grew around their trading trails. Throughout its history, Hawthorne has been known for its agriculture, railroad, and rural lifestyle. Hawthorne&#x27;s population was 1,478 at the 2020 census, up from 1,417 at the 2010 census, with an area of . It is part of the Gainesville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

People have been living in the Hawthorne area since the mid-Woodland period; a Cades Pond culture (100–600 CE) mound is near the city, and an Alachua culture (600–1700 CE) campsite was found in Hawthorne with aboriginal ceramics and lithics. Timucua-speaking natives were living in North Florida when the Spanish arrived during the 16th century. Natives in Alachua County were allied with Chief Potano, and those in Palatka were allied with Chief Utina. In 1774, William Bartram traveled between western Alachua County and the Palatka area on what he called an &quot;old Spanish highway&quot;, an &quot;old Indian and trading trail&quot; which passed through the Hawthorne area. Hawthorne&#x27;s history is tied to its crossroads.

A road between Micanopy and Palatka via the Hawthorne area appears on an 1837 map. During the 1840s, a mill was constructed on Little Orange Creek, east of the center of present-day Hawthorne. The Pleasant Grove Baptist Church was founded at this time, and a post office opened at the mill in 1854. In 1869, the area&#x27;s first school opened in a log cabin.

Phosphate was discovered near Hawthorne during the late 1870s. Near the same time, the first subdivision was platted. The area had been previously known as Jamestown, named after James M. Hawthorn. A second subdivision, Waits Crossing, was platted in 1881. The subdivisions provided north–south and east–west rights-of-way, which brought rail service. Track was first laid by the Peninsula Railroad in Hawthorne in 1879 for a north–south line intended to connect Waldo and Ocala. Near the same time, track laid by the Florida Southern Railroad reached Hawthorne; its east–west line was intended to connect Palatka and Gainesville. Each railroad company had a depot in the Hawthorne area, about a half-mile apart. A Hawthorn post office was established in 1880, and its spelling was changed to Hawthorne in 1950.

On June 23, 1881, 36 years after Florida became a state, the state legislature officially created the municipal corporation as the City of Hawthorn (and in 1950, it was officially named the &quot;City of Hawthorne&quot;, with the &quot;e&quot; added to Hawthorne). Florida Southern began selling land granted to it by the state almost a decade after the railroads were built, including land in Hawthorne described as &quot;in the heart of a famous vegetable region ... large public school, churches, stores, hotels, three cotton gins, wagon repair shop.&quot; At this time, Hawthorne was known for its hunting and fishing and &quot;Northern sportsmen frequented the area to enjoy&quot; it. Sportsmen could stay at William Shepard Moore&#x27;s hotel; he served breakfast early and had hunting dogs, guides, and horses available.

During the 1880s many orange groves were planted in the Hawthorne area, but after the 1894 Great Freeze ruined citrus trees, growers switched to vegetables; the area became known for Sea Island cotton (Pima cotton) around the turn of the 20th century although it had been grown there since at least the early 1880s. The boll weevil halted the cotton trade, however, and Hawthorne diversified into brickmaking, other agriculture, turpentine production, and railroad work. Because two rail lines crossed in the city, it became a transfer point; there was no passenger station, however, and travelers had to walk (or ride) to the connecting line&#x27;s depot. The Florida state railroad commission declared that the depots were inadequate to accommodate the &quot;traveling public&quot;, and required the rail companies to build a segregated union passenger station in Hawthorne by November 1912. Hawthorne was a bustling community in 1913 with a cotton gin, a bank, four general stores, a drug store, three hotels, and two furniture stores.

The city experienced a boom during the 1920s; by late in the decade, Hawthorne had a bank, high school, ice and electric plants, a Western Union, a Railway Express Agency, and a telephone exchange. Although the city suffered during the Great Depression, daily rail service continued; Highway 20 was paved, and a bridge was built over the railroad tracks. The area remained an agricultural center.

The original city hall burned during the mid-to-late 1930s and was replaced by a &quot;white stucco building with Mediterranean influence&quot;, which was Hawthorne&#x27;s city hall until 2018. That year, the city hall moved down the street to an old bank building on the corner of County Road 2082, and the old city-hall building began use as a community center.

During the 1940s, agriculture declined because the land had not been replenished. The pulpwood industry began when National Container (a box company later purchased by Owens-Illinois) bought in the area. A state forest was created south of Hawthorne with of purchased land. While there was not much growth after World War II, Hawthorne was still a center for hunting and fishing. Little growth occurred in the 1950s and 1960s; Hawthorne was known for its lima beans, and more farmland was sold to lumber companies. Trees were still tapped for turpentine before that industry ended in the late 1950s. US 301, built during the early 1960s, bypassed downtown Hawthorne to reduce driving times.

Growth revived somewhat during the 1970s. As automobiles became the dominant means of transportation, passenger trains and buses stopped serving the city. Many residents began commuting to Gainesville to work after local industries declined. The area&#x27;s rural lifestyle became appreciated during the 1980s, although local jobs still existed at sand mines, chicken ranches, and plywood mills. Since the 1980s, Hawthorne has experienced little population growth.

The city of Hawthorne annexed approximately 1,300 acres owned by Plum Creek Land Company in 2015.

<doc id="108963" wikidata="Q1012147" url="?curid=108963" title="Micanopy, Florida">
<text>Micanopy ( ) is a town in Alachua County, Florida, United States, located south of Gainesville. It is part of the Gainesville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population as of the 2020 census was 648, up from 600 at the 2010 census.

It is the oldest community in the interior of Florida that has been continually inhabited. Its downtown area is designated as the Micanopy Historic District, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This municipality contains a number of antique stores, as well as several restaurants, a library, firehouse, and post office. Its unofficial slogan is &quot;The Town that Time Forgot.&quot; 

==History==
A historical marker in the area notes that Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto recorded finding a village of the Timucua portion of the Potano tribe located near by in 1539. In 1774, the American naturalist William Bartram recorded his impressions of a proto-Seminole village named &quot;Cuscowilla&quot;.

By the time Spain ceded its Florida provinces to the U.S. in 1821, the newly constructed hamlet of Micanopy became the first distinct United States town in the Florida Territory. One of the early settlers of the area was Moses Elias Levy, a wealthy Jewish businessman and philanthropist who was involved in West Indies shipping and other interests. He immigrated to the United States in 1820 and founded &quot;Pilgrimage&quot;, the first Jewish communal settlement in the United States located two miles from town.

The village of Micanopy was built under the auspices of the Florida Association of New York (the earliest Florida development corporation, headquartered in Manhattan). Chief Micanopy lived about south in present-day Sumter County. In 1821, when the territorial village was developed, a faction of Miccosukee Indians lived in the immediate area. The historian C. S. Monaco has suggested that the town was named after Micanopy &quot;to appease the chief and acknowledge his original authority over the land.&quot; In the early days, the frontier village was sometimes referred to as &quot;Wantons&quot;, after one of the original settlers. 
Both Fort Defiance (1835–1836) and Fort Micanopy (1837–1843) were located here during the Second Seminole War. Some of the bloodiest battles of that war took place along the road southwest from Fort Micanopy to Fort Wacahoota, just inside modern Alachua County. A recent archaeological study has verified both forts as well as the location of two battlefields within the town limits: the Battle of Micanopy and the Battle of Welika Pond (1836). 

The Town of Micanopy was officially incorporated as a municipality in 1837.
Prior to the 1880s, produce from Micanopy, including citrus, was carried to the southern shore of Lake Alachua and taken by boat to the northern shore, which was served by branch lines from the Transit Railroad. In 1883, the Florida Southern Railway built a branch line to Micanopy from its line running from Rochelle (southeast of Gainesville) to Ocala. In 1895, a rail line was laid from Micanopy by the Gainesville and Gulf Railroad, and by 1889, reached to Irvine and Fairfield in Marion County, and Sampson City in Bradford County, where it connected to the Atlantic, Suwannee River and Gulf Railway and the Georgia Southern and Florida Railroad. The railroads spurred farming in the surrounding area. It had a population of over 600 in 1880. In the 1920s, cars crossed Paynes Prairie on the Micanopy Causeway.

<doc id="108964" wikidata="Q1003844" url="?curid=108964" title="Newberry, Florida">
<text>Newberry is a city located in the southwest corner of Alachua County, Florida, United States. The population was 7,342 as of the 2020 Census, up from 4,950 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Gainesville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. Much of the city borders neighboring Gilchrist County, to the west. 

Developed as a mining and railroad town in the late 19th century, since the mid-20th century it has developed new commodity crops for agriculture. In 1984 Freddie Warmack was elected as its first black mayor, gaining 60% of the white vote. The city&#x27;s historic district is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Since 2019, Newberry&#x27;s city commission has included a National Development Officer for the right-wing John Birch Society.

==History==
Newberry developed as a mining town after phosphate was discovered in the western part of Alachua County in the 1880s. In 1893, the Savannah, Florida, and Western Railway was extended southward from High Springs to Newberry, leading to its development as a railroad town and trading center. A post office established in March 1894 was named Newton, but changed to Newberry in August of that year.

In this period, racial violence against blacks rose in Alachua County, where lynchings took place to enforce white supremacy. A total of 21 people, 19 of them black, were lynched in the county between 1891 and 1926.

By 1896, there were fourteen mines operating nearby. Newberry had hotels, boarding houses, and saloons to accommodate the area&#x27;s transient and sometimes unruly population. The demand for phosphate ended abruptly in 1914, when war was declared against Germany, the principal customer for Newberry&#x27;s phosphate. This caused a loss of jobs in the area, and social tensions rose.

The community turned from phosphate production to agriculture and new commodity crops. It was particularly successful in producing watermelons. The Watermelon Festival, first held in 1946, a year after the end of World War II, continues to be celebrated as an annual event.

Race relations have improved in the town since the late 20th century. Residents elected Freddie Warmack as its first black mayor in 1984; he gained 60% of the white vote.

In 1987, Newberry&#x27;s Historic District was officially listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Lynchings===

On August 19, 1916, what are called the Newberry Six lynchings took place, when three black men, including a minister, and two black women were killed by a white mob in a mass hanging; another man was shot. They had allegedly helped the escape of another African-American man, Boisy Long. He was accused of hog stealing and shooting two men. Filmmaker Patricia Hilliard-Nunn, who is working on a documentary about African Americans in Alachua County, has studied these events. She believes that another three persons may have been lynched in association with the Boisy Long incident, either hanged, as were the Six, or shot to death.

The former chief of the disbanded Waldo Police Department was cleared of any wrongdoing after an investigation by the Florida Criminal Justice Standards &amp; Training Commission (CJSTC). In a letter to the Waldo City Manager, the CJSTC wrote, &quot;The decision is based upon the finding that insufficient grounds exist under the guidelines of Chapter 943.1395, Florida Statutes, to pursue any disciplinary action by the commission.&quot; This event led to then-Florida Governor Rick Scott to sign a bill (SB 264) which better defined the ban on ticket quotas. Waldo is somewhat unique in that unlike most other speed trap towns, &quot;...the speed trap in Waldo, Florida, was brought down not by outside pressure but from the inside&quot;, as reported in May 2022 by &quot;Reason&quot; magazine.

In August 2018, the AAA officially lifted the designation of &quot;speed trap&quot; for the city of Waldo.

==Library==

Lynn Haven Public Library, Bay County&#x27;s first library, was established in the city of Lynn Haven in 1911 when a group of fourteen ladies donated a book and three magazines. Without a true library, they met in various homes and other local buildings as the Lynn Haven Literary Club. By 1915, the collection grew to 500 volumes. In 1922, the McMullin family donated a building and $1,000 and library became known as the McMullin Library. The Literary Club began a weekly story-telling hour on Saturdays for children under the age of twelve.

In 1925, the Literary Club joined the Federation of Women&#x27;s Club, continuing their sponsorship of the McMullin Library. The Lynn Haven Women&#x27;s Club provided building maintenance and expense, made several improvements, and purchased many books.

In 1961, the McMullin Library joined the Northwest Regional Library System. During this time, the city was flourishing and required a larger, more modern building. The building was moved to make room for the widening of Ohio Avenue and was moved three more times before finding a permanent home on Georgia Avenue. In 2017, the Heritage Society of Lynn Haven and the Independent Order of Odd Fellows began a $110,000 renovation project to restore the building.

In 1970, the new North Bay Branch Library was constructed. In the middle of the 1980s, the library underwent a major expansion to improve service and create room for over 11,000 volumes. A fund drive was held, along with funds matched by a grant from the State of Florida allowed for the building addition. The grand opening happened at the end of 1988.

In 1990, the City of Lynn Haven took charge of the library&#x27;s financial responsibilities and the name was changed to the Lynn Haven Public Library.

Hurricane Michael, a category 5 storm, damaged the library in 2018. The building was removed in March 2021. City leaders may use the $1.9 million in insurance money to build a new library in a different location. Plans for a new library were unveiled in January 2022, but no decision has been made as of November 2023.

<text>Panama City is a city in and the county seat of Bay County, Florida, United States. Located along U.S. Highway 98 (US 98), it is the largest city between Tallahassee and Pensacola. It is also the most populated city and a principal city of the Panama City–Panama City Beach, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area with around 200,534 in the metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 32,939, down from the figure of 36,484 at the 2010 census.

==History==
===Name===
The development in this once unincorporated part of Northwest Florida was created by combining the settlements and communities of Floriopolis, Harrison, Millville, Park Resort, and St. Andrews. In 1906, the development was named Panama City and it was first incorporated as Panama City in 1909. When Panama City was incorporated, its original city limits were 15th Street (Hwy 98) on the north, Balboa Avenue on the west and Bay Avenue on the east. According to the Panama City Public Library&#x27;s &quot;A History of Panama City&quot;, George Mortimer West hoped to spur real estate development in Bay County during a period of intense popular interest in the construction of the Panama Canal by changing the town&#x27;s name from Harrison to Panama City, because a straight line between Chicago and the Central American country Panama&#x27;s national capital intersected the Florida town. Additionally, since required meanders around land formations in a seaborne route to the canal added distance when starting at other ports, Panama City was the closest developed port in the US mainland to the Caribbean entrance of the Panama Canal.

Due to its location on the Gulf Coast, the city is susceptible to tropical cyclones. Panama City was directly hit by Hurricane Michael on October 10, 2018, which made landfall as a Category 5 hurricane. The storm caused catastrophic damage to the city and surrounding communities, with winds of 160 mph (260 km/h) at landfall. The city previously suffered significant indirect impacts from Hurricane Ivan (2004) and Hurricane Opal (1995).

==== Major highways ====
* 
* 

====Roads====
The two main east–west thoroughfares in Panama City proper are 23rd Street and US 98. SR 368 runs east–west across the northern part of the city as a bypass. US 98 runs east–west through the city itself, leading southeast to Mexico Beach and west to Panama City Beach.

The two main north–south thoroughfares in the city are Martin Luther King Boulevard, otherwise known as SR 77 and US 231. SR 77 leads north to the Panama City suburb of Lynn Haven. US 231 begins its national journey northward in the city, leading northeast to Dothan, Alabama.

Other more local highways run through the city, including many county roads.

====Bridges====
Because of the city&#x27;s position on St. Andrews Bay, bridges are very important to the area, and most directions into or out of the city require the use of one of three large bridges to cross parts of the bay. These are the Bailey Bridge to the north on Hwy 77, the Dupont Bridge to the south on Hwy 98 and the Hathaway Bridge to the west on Hwy 98. The largest of these is the Hathaway Bridge, which is the only direct connection between Panama City and Panama City Beach.

====Rail====
The Bay Line Railroad has an rail line running north to Dothan, Alabama, to a connection with CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern. Until some point between 1955 and 1956 the Atlanta and St. Andrews Bay Railroad ran passenger trains from Panama City to Dothan, Alabama.

<text>Panama City Beach is a resort town in the Florida Panhandle, and principal city of the Panama City Metropolitan Area. It is a popular vacation destination, especially among people in the Southern United States, and is located in the &quot;Emerald Coast&quot; area. Panama City Beach had a population of 18,094 at the time of the 2020 census, up from 12,018 in 2010. Panama City Beach&#x27;s slogan is &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Beautiful Beaches&quot; due to the unique, sugar-white sandy beaches of the Florida Panhandle.

The town is also a popular spring break destination, due to its beach and proximity to most of the Southern United States. 

Panama City Beach has dangerous rip currents. Multiple people have drowned at Panama City Beach while struggling against rip currents. Sea conditions are particularly dangerous during periods when lifeguards have put up double red flags, indicating active rip currents. Drowning often occurs when people attempt to swim directly against a rip current. By attempting to directly return to the beach, against the rip current, swimmers get tired-out in the process and drown. Instead, swimmers caught in a rip current should relax, and swim parallel to the beach, until they are naturally carried out of the rip current.

==History==
===Real estate boom===
A construction boom in the early to mid-2000s changed the image of the area due to the older homes and motels being replaced with high-rise condominiums and more expansive homes. However, this is turning unobstructed, low-rise beach views and affordable waterfront property into rarities. At the peak of the real estate boom, many beachfront properties had quadrupled or more in value since 2000. In November 2006 CNN/Money named Panama City Beach the No. 1 real estate market in America for the next five years in.

Beachfront property has sold for upwards of $60,000 per &quot;front foot&quot; (linear foot) at the top of the market. The downturn in the U.S. real estate market in 2007, combined with a surge of new condo construction, brought spiraling prices somewhat under control. With the real estate boom, Panama City Beach became a well known destination for spring break.

Category 5 Hurricane Michael made landfall near Mexico Beach in Bay County on October 10, 2018, becoming one of the strongest and most-destructive hurricanes in American history as it destroyed a large part of the county, including many structures in Mexico Beach and Panama City.

<text>Tyndall Air Force Base is a United States Air Force Base located east of Panama City, Florida. The base was named in honor of World War I pilot 1st Lt. Frank Benjamin Tyndall. The base operating unit and host wing is the 325th Fighter Wing (325 FW) of the Air Combat Command (ACC). The base hosts 2,902 active duty members. In October 2018, Hurricane Michael caused significant damage to the base.

==History==

Tyndall Field first opened its doors on December 7, 1941, as a gunnery range. The airfield was named in honor of 1st Lt Frank Benjamin Tyndall. With the establishment of the United States Air Force in 1947, the facility was renamed &quot;Tyndall Air Force Base&quot; on 13 January 1948.
In December 1940, a site board determined that Flexible Gunnery School No. 9 would be located southeast of Panama City, Florida, on East Peninsula. On 6 May 1941, U.S. Army and local dignitaries held an official ground breaking for the school. Panama City&#x27;s mayor, Harry Fannin, dug the first spade full of sand, and Colonel Warren Maxwell, Tyndall&#x27;s first commander, wielded the first ax on the stubborn palmetto plants, so common on the East Peninsula. The site was covered with pine and palmetto trees, scrub brush, and swamps. Bulldozers worked around the clock to clear the brush and fill in swamps. The base also subsumed the settlements of Cromanton, San Blas, Redfish Point, Auburn and Farmdale.
Although construction was well underway, the base lacked a name. Congressman Bob Sikes suggested naming the school in memory of Lieutenant Francis B. Tyndall. A native of Sewall&#x27;s Point, Florida, Lieutenant Tyndall was a fighter pilot during World War I, Silver Star recipient, and commander of the 22nd Aero Squadron, who was credited with shooting down six German planes well behind enemy lines in 1918. While inspecting Army fields near Mooresville, North Carolina, on 15 July 1930, Tyndall&#x27;s plane, Curtiss P-1F Hawk, &quot;28–61&quot;, crashed, killing him instantly. On 13 June 1941, the War Department officially named the new installation Tyndall Field.

On 7 December 1941, the first of 2,000 troops arrived at Tyndall Field. The first class of gunnery students began in February 1942. Although construction was incomplete, instructors and students began preparing for the first class. The first class of 40 gunnery students began on 23 February 1942. Of the thousands of students passing through the Tyndall gates, the most famous was actor Clark Gable, a student here as a U.S. Army Air Forces lieutenant during late 1942 and part of January 1943. Foreign student training began at Tyndall in 1943 with French Air Force gunnery students being the first and Chinese students following later that year.

===Cold War===

When World War II ended, Tyndall Field was demobilized. The base fell under the control of the Tactical Air Command (TAC) in 1946, but this only lasted three months, as Tyndall became part of the Air University (AU). Tyndall Field was subsequently renamed as Tyndall Air Force Base when the U.S. Air Force (USAF) became a separate service in 1947.

In September 1950, Tyndall became an Air Training Command (ATC) installation, designated as the USAF Pilot Instructor School. The base also trained Ground Controlled Intercept (GCI) operators as well as interceptor pilots &amp; flight crews for the Air Defense Command (ADC). Under the auspices of this training system, GCI trainees would direct TF-51H Mustangs against &quot;enemy&quot; A-26 Invaders. In late 1952, both aircraft were replaced by Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star jet trainers. Airborne radar operator students would begin their training aboard radar-equipped TB-25 Mitchells, then transition to either Lockheed F-94 Starfire or Northrop F-89 Scorpion aircraft. North American F-86F and F-86Ds were eventually added to the training program as ADC units were equipped with them.

In September 1957, Tyndall became an Air Defense Command, later Aerospace Defense Command, base until October 1979 when ADC was inactivated and all its bases and units transferred to Tactical Air Command. Tyndall was headquarters of the ADC 73d Air Division in the late 1950s, and the NORAD Southeast Air Defense Sector from 1960 to 1979. ADC&#x27;s 20th Air Division based at Tyndall was responsible for the air defense of virtually all of the southeastern United States during the 1960s and 1970s, while ADC&#x27;s 23d Air Division, also based at Tyndall, was responsible for air defense forces in the upper midwest and south central United States.

====Fighter-Interceptor base====

In the late 1950s into the 1960s, the base transitioned into the North American F-100 Super Sabre, F-101B, F-102A and TF-102B, F-104 Starfighter, and the F-106A and B aircraft, training interceptor pilots for ADC assignments. The base served as a stopover and refueling point for ADC aircraft deployed to Florida during the Cuban Missile Crisis, to be redeployed to other bases in the southeast shortly thereafter. The base maintained an alert facility from which the F-101 Voodoo and F-102 Delta Dagger interceptors were scrambled to intercept unknown aircraft. Tyndall shared training for the F-102 aircraft with Perrin AFB, Texas, until Perrin&#x27;s closure in mid-1971.

====Radar station 1956–present====
On 1 July 1956 Tyndall AFB became the station operating for the third phase of the ADC mobile radar program, designated as TM-198. Activated by the 678th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, Tyndall became operational to support the CIM-10 Bomarc surface-to-air missile program at Hurlburt Field. In 1958 the site was operating with an AN/FPS-20 search radar and a pair of AN/FPS-6 height-finder sets to support the 4751st Air Defense Missile Squadron.

In 1962 the search radar was upgraded and re-designated as an AN/FPS-64. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-198. During 1965 Tyndall AFB joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-09 at Gunter AFB, Alabama. After joining, the squadron was re-designated as the 678th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 June 1965. Also in 1965, Tyndall became a joint-use facility with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

It also received a Back-Up Interceptor Control (BUIC) II, and later BUIC III, capability to perform command and control functions. Tyndall retained this function until the 1980s. On 1 March 1970, the 678th
was redesignated as the 678th Air Defense Group.

In addition to the main facility, Tyndall operated two AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler sites:
* Carrabelle, FL (TM-198A): 
* Eglin AFB, FL (TM-198B): 
On 1 October 1979, this site came under Tactical Air Command jurisdiction with the inactivation of Aerospace Defense Command and the formation of ADTAC. On 1 March 1983 the 678th Air Defense Group was inactivated and Tyndall became the home of the NORAD 23rd ADS (Air Defense Squadron) and operated the Southeast Regional Operations Control Center (SE ROCC), later renamed Sector Operations Control Center (SOCC).

The height-finder radar, modified as an AN/FPS-116 c. 1977, was removed c. 1988. In 1995 an AN/FPS-64A was performing search duties. The site now operates an ARSR-4 search radar under FAA control as part of the Joint Surveillance System (JSS) as site &quot;J-11&quot;.

===Reorganization, 1991–2018===
In 1991, Tyndall underwent a reorganization in response to the Department of Defense efforts to streamline defense management. Headquarters, First Air Force, what had predominantly been the Numbered Air Force for the Air National Guard, moved from Langley AFB, Virginia, to Tyndall. With the disestablishment of Tactical Air Command (TAC) in 1992, Tyndall was temporarily transferred to the Air Combat Command (ACC) and then to the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) in July 1993.

The 21st century proved to be momentous for Tyndall AFB, because it was selected as the first home of the Air Force&#x27;s newest aircraft, the F-22 Raptor. In 2002 the Chief of Staff of the Air Force changed the organizational structure of the 325th Fighter Wing from an objective type wing to a combat organization. This organization moved all maintenance activities under the 325th Maintenance Group and all support activities under the 325th Mission Support Group.

Today, Tyndall is the home of the 325th Fighter Wing, providing training for all F-22A Raptor pilots. In 2012, with the gaining of a combat-coded F-22 squadron, Tyndall AFB returned to Air Combat Command, after a 19-year tenure in AETC.

===Hurricane Michael, 2018===
On 10 October 2018 Hurricane Michael made landfall as a Category 5 hurricane at Mexico Beach just to the east of the base. A weather station near the base recorded a wind gust of before it failed, according to the National Hurricane Center advisory shortly after landfall. The National Weather Service, in a preliminary report released later in the month, stated that the maximum sustained wind speed at the base was and the maximum wind gust was , both from 60°. However, in a later interview with &quot;Aviation Week&quot; on 27 October 2018&quot;,&quot; Commander Air Combat Command general James M. Holmes stated that, based on other data, the actual peak wind speed was closer to 172 mph. Ninety-three Air Force personnel remained on the base during the storm, while the base&#x27;s remaining 3,600 personnel and their families (a total of over 11,000 individuals) were evacuated beforehand. Air Force officials described the damage to the base from the hurricane as &quot;catastrophic,&quot; with all of the base&#x27;s facilities being declared &quot;unlivable&quot;. While efforts to repair the base were underway, as of 12 October 2018 there was no confirmed time of completion on the repairs, according to 325th Fighter Wing Commander Col Brian Laidlaw. Airmen assigned to the 325th Fighter Wing were told they would be away from the installation for a significant amount of time.
Thirty-three of Tyndall´s 55 F-22 stealth fighters were flown to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio before the storm. Many of the seventeen F-22s which were left behind became damaged. The extent of the damage to the planes was then unknown. According to US Senator Bill Nelson and Congressman Matt Gaetz, the aircraft left behind were not in a condition to be flown. A spokesperson for the Air Force said that none of the F-22s were destroyed and that they &quot;believe at this time that they are all repairable.&quot;

In April 2019, the Air Force estimated the hurricane damage to the base at $4.7 billion.

In April 2022, Detachment 1 of the 823rd Red Horse Squadron inactivated at Tyndall and was replaced by the 801st Red Horse Training Squadron. The unit&#x27;s role is to provide integrated, realistic training and exercises to combat support teams.

==Environmental issues==
The soil of an aerial gunnery school training range on Tyndall was contaminated with lead from 12-gauge shotgun shells during World War II. Tyndall Elementary was constructed on the former site of this training range; In 2009 a $5.5 million remediation of the soil at the school was completed and a perimeter fence put up, including a &quot;buffer zone&quot; outside the fence. When the hurricane destroyed the fence in October 2018, contractors erected a temporary replacement slightly offset which included some sections contaminated with lead to be located within the campus. As of August 2019, a new perimeter fence was planned to be erected until 12 August 2019 and School district officials were planning to contact families of the 180 affected students.

<text>Hampton is a city in Bradford County, Florida, United States. It is located in North Florida. The population was 432 at the 2020 census.

==History==

===Early history===

Hampton was first settled in 1859, officially incorporated as the &quot;Town of Hampton&quot; in 1870, and officially reincorporated as the &quot;City of Hampton&quot; in 1925. At the time, it was at the junction of the Georgia Southern and Florida Railway and the Seaboard Air Line Railroad with stations for both.

In the mid-1990s, Hampton annexed a short stretch of U.S. Highway 301 west of the city in order to obtain revenue from traffic tickets issued to motorists driving on that highway. At the peak of this time before the dismantling of the police department, it had 1 officer per 25 residents.

===2013–2014 controversies===
In November 2013, the city&#x27;s mayor Barry Layne Moore was arrested for selling Oxycodone.

On February 10, 2014, auditors from the Florida Joint Legislative Auditing Committee presented 31 violations of state law, city charter and federal tax requirements to state legislators. The city made $211,328 ticketing people driving its of U.S. Highway 301 during 2012, giving the city an unenviable reputation as a &quot;speed trap&quot;. The committee asked State Attorney Bill Cervone to investigate any potential criminal activity and a number of state representatives and senators pursued the dissolution of Hampton. In the wake of the controversy, many city officials resigned. State legislators visited Hampton on March 28, 2014, to see if the issues had been solved. They agreed to let Hampton stay incorporated, because the city retracted the annexation of U.S. Highway 301 and decommissioned its police force. Hampton also accounted for budget shortfalls, and reformed its city council proceedings. In May 2022, the justification for the speed trap was deemed invalid from its inception by Reason magazine, which reported that, &quot;Many speed-trap towns defend their aggressive traffic enforcement on ostensible public safety grounds. But Hampton could not even make that sort of claim, since the highway was a mile away.&quot;

<doc id="108984" wikidata="Q602301" url="?curid=108984" title="Keystone Heights, Florida">
<text>Keystone Heights is a city located in southwestern Clay County, Florida, United States. It is the southwestern most city in the Jacksonville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area, and is the principal city and primary economic driver of the Lake Region, a region in Florida consisting of southwestern Clay County and parts of Bradford, Putnam, and Alachua counties, known for its many lakes. The city&#x27;s name is derived from the state of Pennsylvania&#x27;s nickname, the &quot;Keystone State&quot;. The population of the city was 1,446 at the 2020 census, up from 1,350 at the 2010 census.

==History==
=== Early years and founding ===
In 1917, the area that would eventually become known as the city of Keystone Heights was a small community known as &quot;Brooklyn&quot; located along present day State Road 100, about one mile north of the present location of Keystone Heights on Lake Brooklyn.

In those early days Brooklyn consisted of a large unpainted building called the Brooklyn Hotel; a combination general store and post office; and several small houses scattered about. Property Developer John J. Lawrence, who hailed from Pennsylvania, noticed the area on a visit to Lake Brooklyn, and instantly became attracted to the region.

In 1920, the Lawrence family completed their home, the first house built in Keystone Heights, which overlooked Lake Geneva, and still lies there today at the corner of Jasmine Avenue &amp; Lawrence Blvd. (State Road 21). After hearing of natural wonders and the many different lakes of the area, other families moved to Keystone, putting a strain on those attempting to build structures within the city. Helping to address the issue, in late 1921, C. Ray Lawrence came to Keystone Heights, and began laying out the streets and lots in the city.

The municipality was officially incorporated as the &quot;City of Keystone Heights&quot;, named after Lawrence&#x27;s home state of Pennsylvania&#x27;s nickname, the &quot;Keystone State&quot;, in 1925.

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===

==== Keystone Inn era ====
The opening of the Keystone Inn on New Year&#x27;s Day in 1923 was one of the most significant events in the early history of the city. The inn hosted many festivals and socials, becoming an important centerpiece of the town. The nearby Chautauqua served as an amphitheater attracting various musicians, artists, and speakers from the Chautauqua circuit in New York. Within two years of opening, the Keystone Inn and the community of Keystone Heights were receiving visitors from across the country. The small community had a public beach with a pavilion, picnic grounds and a nine-hole golf course. The University of Florida&#x27;s football team stayed at the inn before their homecoming games. The inn burned down in October 1954 and was never rebuilt, and the property on which it formerly stood is now a park in front of City Hall.

==== 1960 to present ====
In 1984, an American sycamore seedling, germinated by the United States Forest Service, was planted at the Keystone Heights Library. The &quot;Moon Tree&quot; traveled with Stuart Roosa, a former U.S. Forest Service smokejumper, aboard the Apollo 14 mission on January 31, 1971. Roosa and his five varieties of seeds orbited the Moon 34 times and the resulting seedlings were planted all around the United States and the world.

In the early 2000s, the city saw its tourism industry decline as many of its surrounding lakes, which serve as a primary inflow point for the Floridan aquifer, nearly disappeared. Increased rainfall totals in the 2010s have helped in the recovery of many area lakes including Lake Brooklyn and Lake Geneva.

The Black Creek Pipeline, a $43.3 million project to pump excess water from Black Creek in central Clay County to Alligator Creek just north of Lake Brooklyn, is expected to further restore lake levels. The project began in August 2022.

In fall of 2021, Keystone Heights served as the host of the internationally televised Nitro Rallycross North America Championship at the Florida International Rally &amp; Motorsports Park at the Keystone Heights Airport. In April 2022, Keystone Beach hosted the Motosurf Games, a motorized surfboard racing contest on Lake Geneva that was televised on CBS Sports. The games returned to the city in April 2023 as the first race of the 2023 season.

<text>Starke is a city in and the county seat of Bradford County, Florida, United States. The population was 5,796 at the 2020 census. The origin of the city&#x27;s name is disputed. Starke may have been named in honor of local landowner George W. Cole&#x27;s fiancée&#x27;s family or in honor of Madison Starke Perry, fourth governor of Florida.

==History==
===Founding and 19th century===

Prior to 1857, the area that is today Starke was sparsely settled. The announcement of the Fernandina to Cedar Key railroad, which would connect the Atlantic Ocean with the Gulf of Mexico, brought the first known settlement to the community.

In November 1857, the first post office in the area was established by George W. Cole. In 1859, Cole obtained of land around the post office, which were described in his documents as the &quot;Original Town of Starke.&quot;

In 1858, the railroad reached Starke, bringing new residents to the community. The city was incorporated on April 4, 1870. In 1875, Bradford County residents narrowly voted to move the county seat from Lake Butler to Starke. Three additional votes would be taken in later years on the location of the county seat, before the Florida Legislature resolved the issue in 1921, with the creation of Union County.

Starke&#x27;s weekly newspaper, &quot;The Bradford County Telegraph&quot;, began publication in 1879 as &quot;The Florida Weekly Telegraph&quot; (it continues to be the oldest weekly newspaper in Florida today). The city experienced tremendous growth in the 1880s and 1890s from Florida&#x27;s citrus industry. Northerners moved to the area in droves to take a stake in the industry, but the state&#x27;s Great Freeze that, came in the winter of 1894-1895 devastated the area&#x27;s orange groves, moving the citrus industry further south.

===20th and 21st centuries===

Starke oversaw a period of rapid expansion brought on by the new U.S. Highway 301 in the early 1900s, and the construction of Camp Blanding during World War II.

For travelers coming from the northeastern United States, Highway 301 was the quickest route between Jacksonville and Tampa (a title it still holds to this day). Starke&#x27;s status as one of the largest cities on the route, as well its location on State Road 100, brought numerous hotels to the area. The construction of nearby Camp Blanding as a military training facility during World War II added to the local building boom, and by 1950, the city&#x27;s population had doubled.

Post-World War II, the boom continued and the area continued to see an influx of residents working in the service industry and in its strawberry fields. Bradford County&#x27;s famous Strawberry Festival was born during this time, and it continues to attract thousands of visitors today.

In the late 1980s, the city received national media attention during the proceedings of the Ted Bundy case and his eventual execution at Florida State Prison in nearby Raiford, Florida. It also received attention when Lawton Chiles was Florida governor as a notorious speed trap town, even having warning billboards placed on Interstate 10&#x27;s exit onto south US 301. Other speed traps on this stretch of US 301 between I-10 and I-75 were Waldo, Lawtey, and Hampton.

During this time, controversy would also arise over the cross located on the city&#x27;s water tower, as national atheist groups condemned the community. In the early 2000s, a court motion was filed by American Atheists against the city to remove the cross, bringing Starke back into the national spotlight. The battle in court would prove contentious, with most city residents staunchly opposed to its removal. In 2007, a district judge ruled against the city, and the cross would later be moved to a location on private property.

In later years, American Atheists attempted to have a Ten Commandments monument removed from the courtyard of the Bradford County Courthouse. A compromise was eventually reached however in this case.

<text>Cape Canaveral is a city in Brevard County, Florida. It is part of the Palm Bay–Melbourne–Titusville Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 9,912 at the 2020 US census.

==History==

After the establishment of a lighthouse in 1848, a few families moved into the area and a small but stable settlement was born. As the threat of Seminole Indian attacks became increasingly unlikely, other settlers began to move into the area around the Indian River. Post offices and small community stores with postal facilities were established at Canaveral, Canaveral Harbor and Artesia. It is thought the Artesia post office was so named for the ground water of artesian springs that are prevalent in the area.

In 1890, a group of alumni from Harvard University students established a hunters gun club called the Canaveral Harvard Club with a holding of over . Their game hunts helped clear the wilderness for other settlers to move into the area.

In the early 1920s, a group of Orlando journalists invested more than $150,000 in the beach acreage that now encompasses the area of presidentially named streets in Cape Canaveral. They called their development Journalista (now Avon-by-the-Sea) in honor of their trade. A wooden bridge linking Merritt Island with the area had just been constructed. The developers anticipated a growing number of seasonal visitors.

At that time, fishermen, retirees, and descendants of Captain Mills Burnham —the original official keeper of the Cape Canaveral Light—resided in the northern part of the present city.

Due to the hardships caused by the Great Depression, many investors defaulted on their holdings. Much of this land was recovered by newspaper owner R.B. Brossier and his son, Dickson, after they sold their Orlando home and used the remaining $4,500 to purchase much of the Avon area.

In the 1930s, archaeologists from Yale University surveyed various Native American sites in the area.

In 1951, anthropologist Irvine Rouse of Yale University visited the area and performed research.

By 1958, the workforce and the economy had grown with the space exploration program. At that time, state statute allowed an adjacent city to annex an unincorporated area without a vote of the residents. Local property owners were concerned that Cocoa Beach might annex them. Landowners felt that Cocoa Beach had more city debt and higher land taxes than they wished to support.

The City of Cape Canaveral started in 1961, when a committee was formed to incorporate. Due to paperwork delays the city charter was made into bill 167 and approved by the Florida State Legislature in Tallahassee on May 16, 1963.

In 1967, the annual Sun and Space Festival was started. It had flyovers and a parade that included a stop at the newly opened Museum of Sunken Treasure. This contained artifacts from the 1715 Treasure Fleet.

An annual celebration was started on October 9, 1990, The Patriot&#x27;s Day Parade in honor of the last naval battle of the American Revolution that was fought off the Cape Canaveral coast in 1783.

In 2000, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the city&#x27;s divorce rate was the highest in the country, 22%. It was the same rate in 2018.

At a Heritage Day event in March 2013 part of the festivities for the city&#x27;s 50th anniversary included author Jay Barbree who delivered an oral history of the early days. On the 50th anniversary date of May 16, 2013, a 50-year time capsule was sealed and a pictorial postmark of the city&#x27;s anniversary was stamped.

In 2017, the city won &quot;Most Fit City&quot; in the Mayor&#x27;s Fitness Challenge, hosted by Health First.

<text>Cocoa is a city in Brevard County, Florida. The population was 19,041 at the 2020 United States Census, up from 17,140 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Palm Bay–Melbourne–Titusville Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
===Etymology===
Several stories circulate among Cocoa old timers as to how the town got its name. One story says that the mail used to come by river boat and was placed in an empty tin box labeled Baker&#x27;s Cocoa. The box was nailed to a piling in the river next to downtown. Additionally, an early hotel in the area, located on the Indian River lagoon, was named Cocoa House. Another story speaks of an elderly African American woman who lived on the banks of the Indian River. She would supply hot cocoa to sailors traversing the Indian River. It was said, the sailors approaching her house would yell out &quot;Cocoa! Cocoa!&quot; alerting the woman that they were present and wanted the beverage.

===19th Century===
In 1885, the S. F. Travis Hardware store opened. As of 2023, the business remains open. Cocoa&#x27;s business district was mostly destroyed by fire in 1890. But soon, significant development was stimulated by the extension of the Jacksonville, St. Augustine, and Indian River Railway to Cocoa.

The city was chartered on October 1, 1895. In the winter of 1894–1895, Cocoa had an economic setback when the &quot;Great Freeze&quot; destroyed the citrus crop and forced many citrus workers to seek new jobs. By 1903, the population of Cocoa had declined to 382.

===Early 20th Century===
In the 1910s, population growth in Cocoa accelerated. The state business directory of 1911–1912 stated the population was 550.

In October 1918, the mayor of Cocoa proclaimed that all places of assembly, including schools, churches, and movies be closed to avoid spreading the Spanish flu.

By 1925, the population was estimated at 1,800. By 1930, despite the Great Depression, the population had risen to 2,200.

===World War II and beyond===
The population rose dramatically following the development of the space industry, quadrupling from 3,098 in 1940 to 12,244 in 1960. Cocoa and the surrounding area also became integrated with the tourist industry for the first time, as thousands visited the area to witness the launches from Cape Canaveral. By 1980, the population had grown to 16,096.

Education was segregated until the 1960s, at which time Monroe High School and elementary schools for black students were closed.

In 1964, the Cocoa Expo Sports Center (Cocoa Stadium) was built for the Colt 45s spring baseball training and Grapefruit League games. The team later became the Houston Astros. In the early 1980s, the city attempted to upgrade the stadium by asking the Astros to pay for needed repairs. In 1985, the team responded by moving its training to Osceola County Stadium in Kissimmee. As a result, it was decided that future negotiations with major league teams would be done by the county government.

Clearlake Middle School was closed in 2013. Students were moved to Cocoa High School, which was converted to a junior and senior high school.

==Government==
Cocoa first approved the Council-Manager form of government in 1959, and subsequent changes to the state statutes mirrored the City of Cocoa&#x27;s Council-Manager Plan.

The City Council for the City of Cocoa is made up of five members; the Mayor is elected at large and the four council members are elected by each of their districts.
* Mayor – Michael C. Blake

* Councilman, District 2 – Lavander Hearn
* Councilman, District 3 – Matthew Barringer (appointed, upon resignation of previous councilman)
* Councilwoman, District 4 – Lorraine Koss
* City Manager (appointed) – Stockton Whitten
In 2007, the city had a taxable real estate base of $1.18 billion.

Cocoa has its own police and fire department. The Cocoa Police Department is the primary law enforcement agency within the city. It is aided by the Brevard County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, for court and civil process. The Cocoa Fire Department has three stations.

===Water===
Since 1957, Cocoa has supplied the communities of central Brevard County with potable water. Cocoa made major investments in the water supply and treatment facilities needed to produce a sub-regional water system.

In 2017, Cocoa provided an average of of water daily to over 80,000 customers (250,000 people) in Cocoa, Rockledge, Port St. John, Merritt Island, Cape Canaveral, Cocoa Beach, Suntree/Viera, Patrick Air Force Base, Kennedy Space Center and Port Canaveral.

Cocoa&#x27;s water system includes the wellfield and raw water collection system, Wewahootee Water Treatment Plant, transmission mains, and the Dyal Water Treatment Plant (WTP). Cocoa&#x27;s drinking water sources include the Floridian Aquifer, Intermediate Aquifer, Taylor Creek Reservoir, and Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) wells. All of these facilities are located in east Orange County. A distribution system and storage pumping facilities are located in Brevard County.

The Dyal WTP processes about nine billion gallons per year, with peak flows reaching 38 million gallons per day (mgd) during the summer. Daily flows average 25 mgd. The Dyal WTP is unusual for Central Florida because it is capable of treating both ground and surface water.

The flag was originally painted on the water tower free of charge by a Greek immigrant. He wanted to decorate the tower in time for the United States Bicentennial celebration in 1976. In 2014, the City re-furbished and re-painted the tower with the iconic American flags.

<doc id="108989" wikidata="Q852653" url="?curid=108989" title="Cocoa Beach, Florida">
<text>Cocoa Beach is a city in Brevard County, Florida, United States. The population was 11,354 at the 2020 United States Census, up from 11,231 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Palm Bay–Melbourne–Titusville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The first non-native settlement in the area was by a family of freed slaves following the American Civil War. In 1888, a group of men from Cocoa bought the entire tract of land, which went undeveloped until it was bought out in 1923 by a member of the group—Gus Edwards, Cocoa&#x27;s city attorney. At that time, Edwards&#x27; total holdings included approximately . He stopped practicing law to devote all his efforts to developing the area.

Prior to incorporation, the area was known as Oceanus. The Town of Cocoa Beach was established on June 5, 1925. Cocoa Beach&#x27;s first official meeting was held at the Cocoa Beach Casino on July 27, 1925, and adopted the City Seal. Gus C. Edwards was elected as mayor and served as a commissioner along with J.A. Haisten, and R.Z. Grabel. A little less than a month later, plans for a pier became official.

In 1935, the FDOT opened up what is now State Road A1A as a one-lane dirt road to Eau Gallie. In 1938, a Deputy Marshal was appointed &quot;to act in emergencies at night or at other times&quot; for $.25/hour. By 1939, the town had 49 residents. In 1940, the town requested that State Road 140 (now A1A) be routed on Orlando Avenue instead of Atlantic Avenue. In 1942, the town prepared to receive men assigned to the newly opened Naval Air Station Banana River. Establishing regular garbage collection was discussed when the town discovered that the Air Station was having theirs collected.

On May 1, 1942, the German submarine torpedoed the &quot;La Paz&quot; off the shore of Cocoa Beach. The crew was able to beach it with the help of tugs. Eventually it was returned to shipping. On May 3, the same U-boat sank the SS &quot;Laertes&quot; near the same spot. Local boys were recruited for salvaging efforts and to rid the beach of subsequent debris. Shortly thereafter, the federal government realized the danger of back-lighting from the coast making easy targets of passing ships and ordered a blackout for the remainder of the war.

During World War II, Cocoa Beach experienced money shortages to pay employees or to fix roads. In 1944, the town successfully fought a bill introduced in the Florida legislature which would have dissolved the city government. In 1947 a single police officer was hired for $1/hour. The same year, the city constructed works for the distribution of potable water. In 1950, a volunteer fire department was created which used a second-hand vehicle. In 1950, a proposal to prevent people from driving on the beach was defeated. In 1951, the city sought to place a stoplight, the city&#x27;s first, at the intersection of what is now A1A and Minutemen Causeway. In 1953, the city decided to mark the names of all streets. That same year, the city planned to pave A1A south from 520 down Orlando Avenue. The city intended to bear 1/3 of the costs, the adjacent property owners, 2/3.

In 1954, the Women&#x27;s Club opened a library in the building used by the Fire Department. In 1955, the speed limit in most of the town was raised to . In 1955, the city prepared to house the people who were going to be launching missiles from what is now Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.

In 1956, the city attorney warned the council that blacks might attempt to use the beach. If they did, he recommended clearing the beach of all persons, both white and black. The 1954 decision, &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, had, in theory at least, integrated all general public facilities. Actual integration came later.

The city proposed selling the town dump to the school board for a junior high school, in order to keep students from being bused to Merritt Island.

On June 29, 1957, the town of Cocoa Beach incorporated into a city. It sold its water system to Cocoa, Florida and contracted with them to furnish water.

In September 1959, the city voted to add more sidewalks, improve the streets in residential areas as well as the main streets, and to pave more roads.

In 1961, Ron-Jon opened their first store locally.

In 1965, Cocoa Beach High School requested that Cocoa Avenue, the street that the school was located on, be renamed Minutemen Boulevard, in honor of the school&#x27;s mascot, the Minuteman.

Cocoa Beach started its major growth during the 1960s. There was a 1000% population increase from 1950 to 1960, mainly as a result of the U.S. space program. NASA&#x27;s John F. Kennedy Space Center is located approximately north of town. Many people moved to Cocoa Beach due to jobs connected to the space program and in search of new opportunities.

After crewed space flights, the town held parades in honor of the astronauts.

After NASA&#x27;s Apollo program came to an end, and before the Space Shuttle program was in full swing, the town&#x27;s economy reflected the resulting layoffs. At one point, in 1975, unemployment was 14.3%. Many families lost their jobs or simply moved away. The housing market plummeted and some people unable to sell their homes simply abandoned them.

Cocoa Beach was the setting for the 1960s sitcom &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, although no episodes were actually filmed there, and star Barbara Eden only made two visits during the show&#x27;s production—both in 1969, for publicity. Cocoa Beach High School was used as the school in the 2002 movie &quot;Race to Space&quot;.

In 2002, 69% of the voters capped building height to . Prior construction and later variances, resulted in about 80 buildings between high, as of 2018.

The 2010 Nebula Awards were held in the city.

In 2016, the largest mansion in the city was destroyed by fire. It had been built on the beach by Al Neuharth in 1975. It contained of living space, 11 bedrooms and 12 bathrooms. It was valued at several million dollars.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of it is land and of it (67.49%) is water. Bordering the city on the north is Cape Canaveral; on the south is Crescent Beach; on the east is the Atlantic Ocean ( of oceanfront); on the west is the Banana River.

Propelled by a powerful hurricane, the ocean pushed its way through the barrier islands centuries ago and formed the Thousand Islands in the Banana River.

There are a number of boating channels dredged in the area: the 0–99 Channel, the 100 Channel, the 200 Channel for houseboats, the 300 Channel, the 400 Channel near housing for private boats, the 500 Channel and the 600 Channel. Dredged material is placed on one of the Thousand Islands, but is now controlled.

Many of the homes in Cocoa Beach are built on dredged mud and sand from the Banana River.

<doc id="108993" wikidata="Q994766" url="?curid=108993" title="Indian Harbour Beach, Florida">
<text>Indian Harbour Beach is a coastal city in Brevard County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Palm Bay–Melbourne–Titusville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 9,019 at the 2020 census, up from 8,225 at the 2010 census.

It is north of the town of Indialantic and south of Satellite Beach. It is the first and only community in the United States to be a NOAA Tsunami Ready community along the nation&#x27;s East Coast.

==History==

Indian Harbour Beach was founded on June 6, 1955, by W. Lansing Gleason, John H. Neafie, and Louis S. Henry.

In 2013, along with Palm Beach and Sanibel, Indian Harbour Beach ranked among the top 3 places to live in Florida according to AreaVibes livability score.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of it is land and of it (18.63%) is water.

===Fauna===
Threatened Atlantic loggerhead sea turtles nest on the city&#x27;s ocean beaches at densities of approximately one nest per of shoreline per year. Endangered green sea turtles deposit an average of tens of nests along the city&#x27;s ocean beach each year.

Endangered right whales calve off the city&#x27;s shoreline. Endangered West Indian manatees frequent the city&#x27;s canals and the Banana River. Bald eagles forage over Samsons Island.

The of wetland created as mitigation by a local developer on Samsons Island provide nutrient-rich, sheltered aquatic habitat serving as nursery and feeding ground for a diverse assemblage of birds and mammals. The city established Samsons Island Nature Park, the only gopher tortoise relocation recipient site on the barrier island. It is occupied by 42 relocated tortoises and three which had been living on the island when development began. The city has erected five osprey nesting platforms on Samsons Island Nature Park, from which young have been fledged. Efforts are now under way to create habitat for use by gopher tortoises and scrub jays. The city is working with faculty of the Florida Institute of Technology to promote graduate student research and class projects on Samsons Island Nature Park and to assist in devising and implementing maintenance programs to preserve and enhance desirable wildlife habitats.

===Flora===

There are plant species, both indigenous and imported. Vegetated sand dunes are found along most of the beach&#x27;s length and provide the major defense against storm events in the region. Native plant species found on the dunes include sea oats, Sabal palmetto, sea grape, railroad vine, dollar weed, coral bean, Spanish bayonet, wax myrtle, yaupon holly, and several grass species. More salt-tolerant and wind-tolerant species, such as sea oats and railroad vine, are found predominantly on the ocean side of the dune, while other dune vegetation species do not generally show such zonation. These plants assist in building the dune by trapping windblown sand and in stabilizing the dune with extensive lateral root systems.

===Geology===

There are approximately of coquina rock outcrops frequently exposed along the low-tide line of Indian Harbour&#x27;s ocean beach. The National Marine Fisheries Service has classified the rock as an Essential Fish Habitat-Habitat Area of Particular Concern. It is important to aquatic life and found only in a few locations along the Eastern seaboard.

Fossilized Atlantic ghost crabs can be found on the Indian Harbour&#x27;s ocean beach, the remnants of a unique set of geological circumstances which preserved these creatures when they died in their burrows perhaps about 110,000 years ago.

There are significant deposits of sand, marl, coquina and possibly phosphate within the limits of Indian Harbour Beach.

===Surrounding areas===

*Merritt Island; Indian River Lagoon; Banana River; Melbourne 
*Atlantic Ocean 
*Melbourne 
*Satellite Beach 

===Climate===

Indian Harbour Beach is located in the region where the climate is Humid subtropical climate. Daytime temperatures average in the summer months and in the winter months. A study commissioned by NASA lends credence to the notion that Indian Harbour Beach is located in a portion of the North American Atlantic shoreline with a uniquely reduced incidence of catastrophic hurricanes.

<text>Melbourne ( ) is a city in Brevard County, Florida, United States. It is located southeast of Orlando and northwest of Miami. It had population of 84,678 at the 2020 United States Decennial Census, up from 76,068 at the 2010 census. The municipality is the second-largest in the county by both size and population.

The city is also home to the National Weather Service office that serves East Central Florida including the cities of Orlando, Kissimmee, Sanford, Deltona, Daytona Beach, Cape Canaveral, Port St. Lucie and Stuart.

==History==

===Early human occupation===
Evidence for the presence of Paleo-Indians in the Melbourne area during the late Pleistocene epoch was uncovered during the 1920s. C. P. Singleton, a Harvard University zoologist, discovered the bones of a mammoth (&quot;Mammuthus columbi&quot;) on his property along Crane Creek, from Melbourne, and brought in Amherst College paleontologist Frederick B. Loomis to excavate the skeleton. Loomis found a second elephant, with a &quot;large rough flint instrument&quot; among fragments of the elephant&#x27;s ribs. Loomis found in the same stratum mammoth, mastodon, horse, ground sloth, tapir, peccary, camel, and saber-tooth cat bones, all extinct in Florida since the end of the Pleistocene 10,000–8,000 BCE. At a nearby site a human rib and charcoal were found in association with &quot;Mylodon&quot;, &quot;Megalonyx&quot;, and &quot;Chlamytherium&quot; (ground sloth) teeth. A finely worked spear point found with these items may have been displaced from a later stratum. In 1925 attention shifted to the Melbourne golf course.

A crushed human skull with finger, arm, and leg bones was found in association with a horse tooth. A piece of ivory that appeared to have been modified by humans was found at the bottom of the stratum containing bones. Other finds included a spear point near a mastodon bone and a turtle-back scraper and blade found with bear, camel, mastodon, horse, and tapir bones. Similar human remains, Pleistocene animals and Paleo-Indian artifacts were found in Vero Beach, south of Melbourne, and similar Paleo-Indian artifacts were found at the Helen Blazes archaeological site, southwest of Melbourne.

===Settlement===
The first settlers arrived after 1877. They included Richard W. Goode, his father John Goode, Cornthwaite John Hector, Captain Peter Wright, Balaam Allen, Wright Brothers, and Thomas Mason. Three of these men, Wright, Allen, and Brothers were black freedmen.
The city, formerly called &quot;Crane Creek&quot;, was named Melbourne in honor of its first postmaster, Cornthwaite John Hector, an Englishman who had spent much of his life in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia (which was in turn named after the British Prime Minister William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne). He is buried in the Melbourne Cemetery, along with many early residents in the area. The first school in Melbourne was built in 1883 and is on permanent exhibit on the campus of Florida Institute of Technology. By 1885, the town had 70 people. The Greater Allen Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church was founded in 1885 and is still active.

In the late 1890s, the Brownlie-Maxwell Funeral Home opened and it is still in business. The oldest black-owned business in the county is Tucker&#x27;s Cut-Rate plumbing. It opened in 1934.

In the early 1900s, houses were often built in the frame vernacular style.

In 1919, a fire destroyed most of the original downtown along Front Street. At the time, it was rebuilt west of US Hwy 1.

During the Jim Crow years, black people were required to enter movie theaters via a different entrance from whites and sit in the balcony. Gas stations had signs for rest rooms labeled &quot;Men&quot;, &quot;Women&quot;, and &quot;Colored.&quot; This persisted until integration in the late 1960s.

In late 1942 the Naval Air Station Melbourne was established as a site to train newly commissioned Navy and Marine pilots for World War II. The program ran until 1946, and the land that was used for that program makes up most of what is currently the Melbourne Orlando International Airport.

In 1969, the cities of Eau Gallie and Melbourne voted to merge, forming modern-day Melbourne.

===Postwar===

In the 1950s, Babcock Street was extended north to intersect with US 1. The Melbourne Shopping Center was constructed on Babcock, the area&#x27;s first strip mall. Consumers were sufficiently attracted to this new mall, that the traditional downtown, off New Haven, suffered. Urban blight was successfully mitigated in the 1980s.

A board was created by the legislature to spend a 10% tax on electric bills. This was used by the Melbourne Civic Improvement Board to build the Melbourne Auditorium, the first library and fire station, and various parks. The board was dissolved when Melbourne was merged with Eau Gallie in 1969. That merger doubled the size of Melbourne.

Streetlights were gradually added until, by the early 1960s, streets east of Babcock Street had lights. Lights were added to streets west of Babcock after the early 1960s.

In 1969, the city elected Julius Montgomery, its first black councilman. Montgomery was also the first African American student of Brevard Engineering College, later Florida Institute of Technology which named their Pioneer Award after him.

On August 2, 1995, the city received a record of rainfall from Hurricane Erin.

During the week of August 22, 2008, a record of rain fell caused by Tropical Storm Fay.

A 2009 Halloween street party sponsored by a downtown restaurant attracted an estimated 8,000–10,000 people. This overwhelmed the downtown area. Street parties were curtailed until public safety issues were addressed.

On February 18, 2017, president Donald J. Trump held his first post-inauguration rally at the Orlando-Melbourne International Airport drawing a crowd of approximately 9,000 people according to the Melbourne police department.

==Geography==
Melbourne is located approximately southeast of Orlando on the Space Coast, along Interstate 95. It is approximately midway between Jacksonville and Miami. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (14.42%) is water.
The east–west street named Brevard Drive was historically the &quot;center&quot; of town; with addresses called &quot;north&quot; and &quot;south&quot; of this street. The north–south Babcock Street provided the same centerline for &quot;east&quot; and &quot;west&quot; directions.

Melbourne Beachside has a small presence on the South Beaches barrier island. It is often confused with Melbourne Beach, a separate political entity.

===Climate===

Melbourne, Florida has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;), bordering closely to a tropical savanna climate (&quot;Aw&quot;). Melbourne has a distinctly seasonal precipitation pattern, with a hot and wet season (late May through October) and a warm and dry season (November through April). The climate is strongly influenced by the nearby Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Stream, as well as incursions of cold fronts from the north in winter months.
Melbourne averages of rainfall annually, much of it coming in convective thunderstorms in the late May to early October time period. The record rainfall occurred on August 20, 2008, when Tropical Storm Fay dropped . Melbourne can sometimes have moderate to severe drought conditions from late fall through spring, with brush fires occurring and water restrictions put in place. Melbourne averages 2 days per year with frost, although several years might pass without a frost in the city of Melbourne or at the ocean beaches. On Christmas Eve 2003, the city as others in east central coast of Florida received snow from the ocean effect, when cold air passes over the considerably hotter ocean and causes the rise of air with higher temperature to bring moisture into the higher portions of the atmosphere.

===Flora===

Tropical flora typical of more southerly locations is grown in the Melbourne area (coconut palms, royal palms, Christmas palms, and bananas), but can be damaged or killed when subjected to infrequent light freezes or cooler temperatures, although several years might pass without a freeze in the Melbourne area. The Melbourne area has many lush gardens and public landscapes, and is noted for the botanical northern limit of cultivated coconut palms on the Florida East Coast.

===Environment===

The Florida Department of Environmental Protection has ordered the city to reduce pollution of the Indian River Lagoon, which it borders; about 80% of the city&#x27;s landmass drains in the direction of the lagoon. The city must reduce run-off by of nitrogen and of phosphorus. The city responded by banning the use of fertilizer before flood and storm warnings.

<text>Melbourne Beach is a town in Brevard County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Palm Bay–Melbourne–Titusville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population had 3,231 residents at the 2020 United States Census, up from 3,101 at the 2010 census.

==History==

The Ais Indians resided in the area in pre-Columbian times. In 2010, a midden near Aquarina included a burial ground for a chief and two handmaidens.

It has been suggested that Juan Ponce de León landed near Melbourne Beach in 1513, where he then became the first European to set foot in Florida. A determination of this was made by a historian in the 1990s, who believed that the spot was &quot;within five to eight nautical miles&quot; on the barrier island with a proposed name of Ponce de León Island. However, this suggestion has not been met with wide acceptance from historians who state that de Leon&#x27;s landing place cannot be known within a leeway of less than a hundred miles or so. A statue of Ponce de León was erected at &quot;Juan Ponce de León Landing&quot; in Melbourne Beach to commemorate his discovery.

Melbourne Beach is Brevard County&#x27;s oldest beach community.

In 1879, a hotel, the Oak Lodge, was built for researchers and naturalists on a location near Aquarina.

In 1921, the Melbourne Causeway was built, connecting Melbourne Beach to the mainland via the town of Indialantic. In 1923, it was incorporated as a town.

In 1928, Harry J. Brooks, attempting to set a long distance record, crashed a Ford Flivver off the coast of Melbourne Beach, resulting in his death.

The town&#x27;s population oscillated until World War II, when it began growing steadily. Currently, it is largely residential, with an elementary school, some businesses, and many condominiums in the unincorporated areas to the north and south.

In 2007, it was voted one of ten best bargain retirement spots in America.

In 2016, a Publix located four miles south of Melbourne Beach sold one of the winning tickets in the $1.3 billion Powerball.

<text>Melbourne Village is a town in Brevard County, Florida. It is part of the Palm Bay–Melbourne–Titusville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area, and is the smallest incorporated municipality (by population) in Brevard County. The population was 681 at the 2020 US Census, up from 662 at the 2010 census. 

==History==
Virginia Wood, Elizabeth Nutting, and Margaret Hutchinson came from Dayton, Ohio in 1947, following the end of World War II to the area of Melbourne, Florida. Their goal was to establish a community for people seeking a lifestyle that was simple and close to nature. This social experiment was an “intentional community”, a response to the hardships of the Great Depression. The founders were influenced by the concepts and teachings of Ralph Borsodi, who also lived in Melbourne Village from 1950 to 1960. Many early residents cleared their land, built their own houses, and ran small home businesses, from organic gardening to raising chinchillas, in order to help support themselves and their families. There was a community store run on the honor system. Early families overcame the lack of construction materials for civilian use immediately following World War II by purchasing and relocating surplus military barracks from nearby bases. Two of these barracks still remain, one being the Original Melbourne Village Hall and the other a private residence.

The Town of Melbourne Village was incorporated in 1957 out of concern of being annexed by Melbourne or included in the subsequent incorporation of West Melbourne, Florida.

==Government==
The Town of Melbourne Village is governed by a Town Commission of seven members, one of whom is the Mayor/Commissioner. By town charter, these are unpaid positions. The Mayor and Commissioners are non-partisan positions and are elected in November during the general elections for two year terms. Terms are staggered, with three commission seats up for election each year plus the mayoral seat up every other year. Each year, the Commission elects one of their members as the Vice Mayor. The Commission meets at least once a month to deal with town business, in a modified &quot;town hall&quot;-style meeting. This form of government is a mixture of the &quot;Council-Manager&quot; and the &quot;Mayor-Council&quot; systems, as the Mayor is elected (rather than appointed) yet does have a vote on the Commission. While the Mayor is responsible for the day-to-day executive oversight and guidance for the town (in essence, the Town&#x27;s &quot;city manager&quot;), the Commission can reverse or direct the Mayor&#x27;s actions.

Three departments serve the town with paid employees: Administration, Public Works, and Police. The Police department has been subcontracted to Brevard County Sheriff&#x27;s department recently.

===American Homesteading Foundation===
The American Homesteading Foundation was the entity behind the founding of Melbourne Village. All homeowners in the town are given the option of being members of the AHF. The AHF was founded in 1946 by Virginia Wood, Elizabeth Nutting, and Margaret Hutchinson, and is a not-for-profit corporation and independent of the official municipality. The AHF serves the community by owning, maintaining, and operating all the community property within the town, and sponsors recreational and educational activities throughout the year. The community property includes approximately of parks and paths, the Village Hall, and the AHF Swimming Pool. In its modern form, the main function of the AHF is sometimes described as an independent self-funded Parks and Recreation department for the town&#x27;s residents.

===Community involvement===
More than 25 percent of the residents of Melbourne Village are routinely involved in committees and volunteer events. In the 2008 elections, voter turnout for Melbourne Village (Precinct 31) was 95 percent. Even in non-presidential election years, turnout is typically 60 percent to 80 percent.

===Planned development===
The Vision 2012 Committee was chartered by the Town Commission in March 2006, as a response to trends and concerns about recent construction that, if not addressed, could significantly change the existing neighborhood character via the larger size of structures, greater lot coverage, and the loss of green-space.

The result of this work was the Responsible Growth Plan, a set of ordinances that developed building coverage ranges for all lot sizes, devised incentive strategies to encourage homeowners and builders to minimize the visual and environmental impact of larger lot coverage, improved the town&#x27;s code emphasis on tree canopy, green conservation, and native vegetation, and provided a way to manage all these objectives via the Town Review Board.

==Parks and recreation==
Erna Nixon Park is a park opened in 1976. It is a habitat for native plants, birds, and animals, including gopher tortoises, indigo snakes, and bobcats.

<text>Merritt Island is a peninsula, commonly referred to as an island, in Brevard County, Florida, United States, located on the eastern Florida coast, along the Atlantic Ocean. It is also the name of an unincorporated town in the central and southern parts of the island and a census-designated place (CDP).

The population was 34,518 at the 2020 census, down from 34,743 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Palm Bay–Melbourne–Titusville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

NASA&#x27;s John F. Kennedy Space Center is located on Merritt Island to the north of the town, and Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge is located north of the space center.

The central part of Merritt Island, previously known as Merritt City, is home to the majority of the population and includes the local high school, library, and shopping district. The southern area is heavily residential, with centralized light commercial and light industrial areas.

== History ==
=== Etymology ===

Merritt Island owes its name to the King of Spain. The entire island was part of a land grant given by the King to a nobleman named Merritt.

=== Prehistory ===
Paleontological excavations in the area have unearthed the remains of numerous megafauna and other extinct species, including many herbivorous ungulates, artiodactyls (camelids, peccaries), perissodactyls (equids, tapirs), proboscideans (mammoths, mastodons), rodents (beaver, capybara, porcupine), tortoises and xenarthrans (armadillos, glyptodonts). These species, and many more, thrived in the region up to approx. 11,000 years ago, when a larger North-American extinction event caused the majority of native megafauna to die out; this was possibly due to climate change caused by the advancing and/or retreating of the glacial maximum, thus affecting natural resources and weather conditions. Later, more pressures on wildlife would have come from the arrival of the Clovis culture, who became prolific hunters with their distinct, fluted stone weaponry—including some of the earliest spears and arrowheads. Biochemical analyses have shown, for example, that Clovis tools were used in the hunting of camelids. The Pleistocene, or Quaternary, megafaunal extinction also coincided, roughly, with the appearance of the Clovis culture.

By between 800-900 BC, permanent Native American structures were erected in the area. Their mounds populated the lagoon margin.

=== Post-Columbian ===
In 1605, Spanish explorer Álvaro Mexía visited the local tribes living in the Indian River area. He interacted with the local tribe of Ais people, part of the native province of Ulumay. Merritt Island is the prominent island on a color map he drew of the area, a copy of which is in the archives at the Library of Congress and the archives in Seville, Spain. Within a few years, all but a handful of these natives were dead from an epidemic that plagued the area after a British merchant ship ran aground.

In the 1760s, the Elliott Plantation grew and processed sugar cane. Remains of the plantation can be found in the Wildlife Refuge. In April 1788, French botanist André Michaux traveled to Merritt Island, near Cape Canaveral, and spent five days looking at the local plants. He wrote a letter on April 24, 1788, from St Augustine. He reported discovering the flag or bigflower paw-paw, &quot;Asimina obovata&quot; (&quot;Annona grandiflora&quot; ). 

In 1837, Fort Ann was constructed on the east coast of Merritt Island, near present-day Haulover Canal, to protect the area against the local Seminoles. Merritt Island&#x27;s recent history dates back to the mid-19th century, and centers on the growth of citrus, with an emphasis on the cultivation of oranges as well as pineapples. The Indian River oranges and grapefruit come from this sandy area. Freezes temporarily destroyed the local pineapple industry in the late 1890s. Freed slaves constructed small towns in the area after the Civil War, including Haulover, Clifton, and Shiloh.

The island&#x27;s population grew in the 1950s and 1960s as the Space Race began and nearby NASA expanded. Construction of a barge canal to the Intracoastal Waterway from the Atlantic Ocean (for power plant oil shipments) cut off the northern half of the island for many years. To this day, the northern portion of the island remains slightly less developed, with a few areas remaining as cattle pasture or citrus land. The small towns on the island vanished with the coming of the Space Age, and now only live on in the names of streets and historic churches. In 1988, citizens defeated a proposed incorporation into a city, 77% opposed to 23% in favor.

Sea Ray Boats operated a factory on Merritt Island from 1978 to 2012. At one time it employed 1200 people. It closed the plant in 2013.

== Geography ==
Merritt Island extends some from the Volusia County line to Dragon Point near Melbourne. It connects to the Florida mainland where SR 3 now intersects US 1 in Volusia County. To the west it is separated from the mainland by the Indian River and the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. To the east it is separated by the Mosquito Lagoon and the Banana River from the barrier island on which Cape Canaveral and Cocoa Beach stand. The east side of Merritt Island splits and is divided by Sykes Creek and Newfound Harbor.

In the north, the Haulover Canal, first dug in the 19th century, separates the island from the mainland. To the west, the island is connected by causeways to mainland Brevard County near Titusville and Cocoa on its northern end, and in Melbourne on its southern end. To the east the island is connected to Cape Canaveral by the Crawlerway, and by causeways to Cocoa Beach and Satellite Beach.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 62.88%, is water.

=== Fauna ===
To the north, Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, along with a narrow barrier island that make up Canaveral National Seashore, offer an unpopulated protected buffer area for rocket launches at Kennedy Space Center. There are about 356 species of birds on the peninsula, one of the most diverse in the country. Migratory birds join the more resident wildlife, including alligators, manatees, dolphins, sea turtles, bald eagles, ospreys, bobcats, and the elusive Florida panther. A number of bald eagle nests are monitored atop power line poles along SR 3 within Kennedy Space Center.

There are about 12,000 feral pigs in North Merritt Island. Licensed trappers catch about 2,000 annually, which keeps the population even. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service would like to reduce the population.

=== Places on Merritt Island ===
Merritt Island has or had 23 named communities, all unincorporated, including:

==History==
Mims, Florida received its name after its earliest settlers; Britton J. Mims, Robert Mims, and Casper Neil Mims. The three brothers were reputedly distant relatives to Jesse James. Casper later established the first Mims general store circa 1876.

Henry Flagler&#x27;s East Coast Railroad construction starting 1885 expanded the community. By 1893, with railroad in place, both Mims and neighboring city Titusville began shipping citrus and lumber to northern cities. By the end of the 19th century citrus farms began to dominate the local economy.

The settlement was organized as a city in the early 1900s; continuing slow growth until the start of the great depression. During the first years of the great depression large numbers of residents reportedly left looking for work. Mims, unable to sustain a municipal government, subsequently reverted to an unincorporated township within Brevard County, Florida.

=== Murders of Harry and Harriette Moore ===
African-American civil rights leader Harry T. Moore and his family resided in Mims from at least the 1920s. Known as a national civil rights leader, teacher and founder of the Brevard County NAACP, he and his wife Harriette were targeted for assassination Christmas Eve, 1951; they received fatal injuries when a bomb exploded from under their home. Moore died in the blast; his wife survived until January 3, 1952 . Both of their daughters survived the attack. The murders were racially motivated and believed to have been committed by members of the Ku Klux Klan.

The FBI investigated the case in 1951–1952, and the county and state in the 1970s and 1990s. The state reinvestigated in 2005, after suspected perpetrators had died. No prosecutions or charges were ever brought against the purpetrator(s). Multiple sites in Mims and Brevard County are dedicated to the Moores including the Moore Memorial Park and Cultural Center in Mims.

The city&#x27;s population was 119,760 at the 2020 United States census, up from 103,190 at the 2010 census, making it the most populous city in the county and the largest by land mass.

Palm Bay is a principal city of the Palm Bay−Melbourne−Titusville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had a population of 606,612 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The Ais people, attracted to the mouth of Turkey Creek at the Indian River by freshwater springs, fish, oysters, and wildlife, are thought to have been the first inhabitants in the Palm Bay area.

The earliest place names for this area on early maps of the late 1700s were &quot;Turkey Creek,&quot; &quot;Elbow Creek&quot; and &quot;Crane Creek&quot;. An 1870 map of the Indian River by John Andrew Bostrom shows the area void of any settlements within about 15 miles of Turkey Creek. The first prominent European-American settler was John Tillman in the late 1870s. Tillman&#x27;s wharf marked the mouth of Turkey Creek at what became known as Palm Bay on the Indian River.

By the late 1880s, Tillman was operating a profitable orange and banana grove on the north shore of the creek. He had the most notable banana grove on the Indian River. Tillman&#x27;s wharf also attracted settlers, as it was a steamboat stop.

By the mid-nineteenth century, there was a lumber operation, orange groves, and packing house. Growth was slow until the arrival of the railroad in 1894. Then goods were brought in and produce was shipped to market faster.
===1900s===
Between 1910 and 1914, a land company known as the Indian River Catholic Colony became established at Tillman. Attempting to grow two crops a season, farmers quickly depleted the soil, and the colony failed. Those remaining built St. Joseph&#x27;s Church on Miller Street, the oldest building still standing.

In the 1920s, the city was renamed as Palm Bay, after the bay bordered with sabal palm trees known as Palm Bay, located at the mouth of Turkey Creek. A group of Tillman businessmen established the Melbourne-Tillman Drainage District, and issued $1.5 million worth of bonds. Starting in 1922, a grid of 80 canals was dug to drain of swampy land west of Palm Bay for other uses. The canals made it possible to control flooding and redevelop marsh lands to agricultural use. These actions had the unintended consequences of leaving the land more vulnerable to flooding from storms and destroying important habitats for complex ecology.

Farmers planted citrus groves and truck farms which shipped winter produce by the Florida East Coast Railroad to northern markets. Farmers sold timber and land to paper companies. Based on use of the Tillman and Hopkins canals, ranchers raised beef cattle in West Melbourne.

In 1926, a fire among the dredges and a severe hurricane caused extensive damage, leading to an economic downturn in Palm Bay. The Melbourne-Tillman Drainage District went bankrupt.

In 1959, General Development Corporation purchased and platted extensive tracts of land in Palm Bay for a large residential project known as Port Malabar. The city of Palm Bay incorporated on January 16, 1960. Prior to expanding its borders, the city population was 2,808 that year.

The active development of the city after that point was intertwined with GDC, which laid out and built many of the streets, sold and built many of the city&#x27;s homes, and built a water treatment plant. This was later purchased by the city of Palm Bay after GDC filed for bankruptcy in 1991.

The Melbourne-Tillman Water District was revived under the auspices of the County Government. In 2019, it controlled of land.

On April 23, 1987, William Bryan Cruse Jr. shot and killed six people, including two college students and two police officers, at a local shopping center. He also wounded ten other people. The shooting by the 59-year-old, who was retired or unemployed and caring for a chronically ill wife, made national news. Convicted and sentenced to death, Cruse died on Florida&#x27;s death row in 2009.

In October 1994, $500,000 of gold and gems stolen from a jewelry store which was at the time the largest single robbery in the city&#x27;s history. Police suspected a connection with a similar robbery in May 1994 in Daytona Beach. Larry Lawton was later charged in 1996 with the crime after fingerprint evidence linked him to the crime.

===2000s===
For three consecutive years between 2003 and 2005, Palm Bay was a finalist for the All-America City Award.

In 2008, the city was named in an article from &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; as the second &quot;Drunkest City&quot; in the US behind Reno, Nevada.

In 2008, the former Port Malabar Country Club property was revalued at $300,000. This was considered an essentially &quot;worthless&quot; valuation because arsenic had been found in the groundwater and remediation would cost an estimated $12 million to clean up.

Hundreds of miles of roads in the city are in such poor condition that the city Public Works Department considers them unserviceable. The voters have consistently defeated measures to raise money to invest in infrastructure to improve the roads, which are described as the worst in Brevard County. In 2005, they voted down a $58.7 million bond measure. In 2009, they defeated a $75.2 million tax referendum. In 2010, voters living in areas with the worst roads voted 9–1 against $44.7 million assessment for repairing them. In 2011, the city government created a Palm Bay Road Maintenance District that they hope can levy taxes and alleviate the situation.

In 2008, fires on Mother&#x27;s Day destroyed 37 homes in the southwest area of the city. Arson has been blamed as the cause of at least a few of the numerous fires.

In 2009, the Brevard Zoo moved the remaining 15 Florida scrub jay families native to the city to Buck Lake Conservation Area in Mims. The Florida scrub jay is a threatened species due to it being territorial; it is unable to move to better grounds when its habitat is jeopardized.

===2010s===
In 2010, plans were revealed by a private company to develop Emerald City, a large planned development within the city limits. The company intends to develop a multi-use, eco-friendly urban community to include residential zones consisting of townhouses, and commercial zones consisting of state-of-the-art medical facilities, research and development centers for technology firms, and urbanized retail shopping centers. As of February 2016, Emerald City is in the development phase.

City fiscal concern over firefighters&#x27; pensions rose during 2010. Firefighters&#x27; salaries averaged $71,100 annually plus $5,590 overtime pay. They were eligible for 100% of base pay after 28 years of service.

In 2012, construction began on the St. John&#x27;s Heritage Parkway (also known as the Palm Bay Parkway), an arterial roadway that runs north to south along with the western limits of the city. A portion of the parkway opened to the public in 2015. The project was in development for more than a decade. It is intended to alleviate traffic for commuters on the main thoroughfares of SR 507, CR 509, and I-95. Later phases of the project will bring the roadway further south and then east following the lower city limits, eventually connecting to I-95 just north of Micco Road. A state roadway improvement project includes planned widening SR 507 (Babcock Street) from four lanes to six.

In 2015, the Harris Corporation constructed a new 464,000-square-foot technology center near Palm Bay Road and Troutman Boulevard. The building is one of the largest in the northeast section of the city and is reported to house approximately 1,400 scientists and engineers for the company.

In 2017, construction began on the southern Interstate 95 interchange and the southern portion of the St. John&#x27;s Heritage Parkway. The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) is constructing a new diverging diamond interchange DDI on Interstate 95 just north of Micco Road within the city limits. The city is working on the southern portion of the parkway to extend from Babcock Street SE to Micco Road. The project is intended to improve traffic capacity, operations, and safety, as well as promote economic development in southern Brevard County.

The city formerly monitored some intersections with radar cameras, resulting in the issuing of traffic tickets to drivers who ran red lights. In 2013, these monitored intersections were found to be no safer than unmonitored ones. These cameras were removed in 2014.

In 2018, voters passed a referendum in the November 2018 elections, electing to fund a city-wide road repair project with a general obligation bond worth $150,000,000 payable from annual ad valorem taxes. Planning, design, and construction for the city&#x27;s four quadrants are currently underway with a tentative 8-year plan projected. Construction of several units began in August 2019.

In 2002, a group of five Port St. John residents formed &quot;Port St. John For Tomorrow&quot; (PSJ4T) and tried to incorporate the Port St. John area. Included in PSJ4T&#x27;s incorporation plans were five separate communities: Delespine, Williams Point, Hardeeville, Frontenac and a part of Sharpes. PSJ4T had not informed these five communities. When the five communities did find out, they expressed disinterest in being included in the incorporation effort. A feasibility study was requested by PSJ4T members. Voters approved the study. The study was funded by Brevard County and performed by the University of Central Florida. The five reviewing committees in Tallahassee said the study was &quot;deeply flawed.&quot;. The county allowed the residents of Port St. John and the five communities to vote on becoming a city. Howard Futch and Randy Ball (CS/HB 1071) sponsored the bills in the Senate and House. The incorporation issue was defeated in November 2002, 73% to 27%, including most of the people in the five communities. State statute prevented Port St. John from considering incorporation for ten years.

<doc id="109005" wikidata="Q1979566" url="?curid=109005" title="Rockledge, Florida">
<text>Rockledge is the oldest city in Brevard County, Florida. The city&#x27;s population was 27,678 at the 2020 Census, up from 24,926 at the 2010 United States Census, and is part of the Palm Bay−Melbourne−Titusville Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==


Rockledge was officially founded on August 7, 1887, making it the oldest incorporated municipality in Brevard County. The name Rockledge, attributed to Gardner S. Hardee, an early settler, comes from the many ledges of coquina rock that line the Indian River. Other sources refer to a man named Cephas Bailey Magruder, who built his home after settling in the area in 1876 near the Indian River. Magruder called his home &quot;the rockledge home&quot; and the name was eventually attributed to the whole town. It was originally referred to as Rock Ledge; the two-word name persisted through the 19th century.
Early industry in the area was based on the citrus trade and accommodation for tourists traveling to South Florida via the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway of the Indian River.

President Grover Cleveland and his wife visited the city in 1888.

The town had several large hotels in the late 19th century to the early 20th century that catered to Northern tourists escaping cold winters. These included the Hotel Indian River, the Plaza, and the Rockledge Hotel, all located north of Barton Avenue, looking out over the river.

Towards the early part of the 20th century, Rockledge was known as a resort town. In the winter months, the population would rise from 200 to almost 2,000 people. Up until about 1911, access to Rockledge was via boat and rail. Steamboats in the Indian River connected with Henry Flagler&#x27;s trains to bring people to the North. Small boats, sailboats, and small launches frequently stopped to unload freight and passengers. Most of the tourists in this time were wealthy and would use the boats to connect to the rail system at that time. After World War I, the automobile allowed the average person to travel to the area and their encampments dotted the area. The Dixie Highway was completed in 1915 and spanned most of Florida. In the 1920s, US1 was paved and replaced the Dixie Highway.

In 1939–1940, a winter visitor donated the money to construct a hospital. The mayor convinced the council to donate land from the former golf course that had belonged to the defunct Indian River Hotel for the hospital. In 1941, 10-bed Wuesthoff Hospital was established with a $12,500 gift given by the heirs of Eugene Wuesthoff and matching contributions from 500 Rockledge community residents.

Rockledge underwent an expansion further west and south in the 1960s when it became a bedroom community for the nearby Kennedy Space Center. Several hundred families from all over the United States settled in the city with the advent of the Apollo missions and the space shuttle program. Recently in 2022 and 2023, the City has annexed property west of Interstate 95. 

Barton Boulevard supplements US Route 1 as the town&#x27;s economic and cultural center as new subdivisions spread south along Fiske Boulevard. Commercial is now found along Fiske Boulevard, Murrell Road, and Barnes Boulevard. By the 1970s, the bulk of Rockledge&#x27;s population lived between US Route 1 and Interstate 95. This is still true in 2023, yet multi-use development is expected on the west side of Interstate 95.

Developments stretched north to south from the late 1950s to the 1990s. Virginia Park, Marlin Manor, Fairway Estates, Rockledge Country Club Estates, Golfview Estates, Kings Grant, Georgetown, Levitt Park and Woodsmere had all been established by the 1960s–1980s.

Levitt Park and Woodsmere were built atop a gladiola farm and an orange grove. The huge Australian Pine trees at the southernmost points of Fiske Boulevard are all that remain of the grove&#x27;s windbreaks. The subdivision of Silver Pines, while part of unincorporated Brevard County outside the city limit, was also built during this period and is identified by citizens as a part of the city.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (11.03%) is water.

It is bounded on the north by Cocoa, on the west by the St. Johns River and scrubland, to the south by Viera (unincorporated) and Melbourne, and to the east by the Indian River Lagoon and Merritt Island (unincorporated) on the opposite shore.


===Climate===
Rockledge has a humid subtropical climate, Köppen climate classification Cfa. The area&#x27;s warm and humid climate is caused primarily by its proximity to the Gulf Stream, which flows off the east coast of Florida. There are two major seasons which characterize the area. The warm season is hot and rainy lasting from June until late September. The cool season the dry season, October through May, brings more moderate temperatures and less frequent rainfall.

===Environment===
Rainfall can run off from the city into the Indian River Lagoon, with resultant pollution. As a result, the city has banned fertilizing from June 1 to September 30 annually.

<text>Satellite Beach is a coastal city in Brevard County, Florida, U.S. The population was 11,226 at the 2020 United States Census, up from 10,109 at the 2010 census, and it is located with the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Banana River to the west. Satellite Beach is part of the Palm Bay–Melbourne–Titusville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==

Satellite Beach is located at (28.173441, –80.596674). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of it is land and of it (31.94%) is water.

The Atlantic Ocean forms its eastern border; the Indian River the western border. It is located on the local barrier island directly south of Patrick Space Force Base. It is part of the South Beaches.

With both ocean and river frontage, the city is the largest beachside community in South Brevard County. There are of shoreline in the city, including of Atlantic Ocean beach, of Banana River shoreline, and of shoreline fronting navigable canals connected to the Banana River.

===Climate===

Satellite Beach is located in the region where tropical and temperate climatic zones overlap. A study commissioned by NASA lends credence to the perception that Satellite Beach is located in a portion of the North American Atlantic shoreline with a reduced incidence of catastrophic hurricanes. Extremes range from on December 24, 1989 to on July 15, 1981.

===Fauna===
Threatened Atlantic loggerhead sea turtles nest on the city&#x27;s ocean beaches at densities of approximately one nest per of shoreline per year. Endangered green sea turtles also deposit nests along the city&#x27;s ocean beach each year.

Endangered North Atlantic right whales calve off the city&#x27;s shoreline. Endangered West Indian manatees frequent the city&#x27;s canals and the Banana River. Bald eagles forage over Samsons Island.
The of wetland created as mitigation by a local developer on Samsons Island provide nutrient-rich, sheltered aquatic habitat serving as nursery and feeding ground for a diverse assemblage of birds and mammals. The city established Samsons Island Nature Park, the only gopher tortoise relocation recipient site on the barrier island. It is occupied by 42 relocated tortoises and three which had been living on the island when development began. The city has erected five osprey nesting platforms on Samsons Island Nature Park, from which young have been fledged.

Efforts are now under way to create habitat for use by gopher tortoises and scrub jays. Xeric scrub around the local county library, until the late 1990s, hosted a family of threatened Florida scrub jays.

The city is working with faculty of the Florida Institute of Technology to promote graduate student research and class projects on Samsons Island Nature Park and to assist in devising and implementing maintenance programs to preserve and enhance desirable wildlife habitats.

The city has approved the use of inland dirt-officially called upland sources-to be used in beach nourishment projects. These projects will bury part of a natural reef. After three projects, the sea shells are gone, and turtle nesting declined significantly in the years following this nourishment.

===Flora===
Due to the moderating influence of surrounding water bodies, the climate on the barrier island supports tropical species of plants normally found far to the south. Brevard County&#x27;s barrier island to, approximately, Cape Canaveral, constitutes the northernmost limit of the range of many of these plant species. At the same time, the infrequency and mildness of freezes in the Central Florida region serves to define the southern limit of many plants found in temperate zones. Vegetated sand dunes are found along most of the beach&#x27;s length and provide the major defense against storm events. Native plant species found on the dunes include sea oats, Sabal palmetto, sea grape, railroad vine, dollar weed, coral bean, Spanish bayonet, wax myrtle, yaupon holly, and several grass species. More salt-tolerant and wind-tolerant species, such as sea oats and railroad vine, are found predominantly on the ocean side of the dune, while other dune vegetation species do not generally show such zonation. These plants assist in building the dune by trapping windblown sand and in stabilizing the dune with extensive lateral root systems.

===Geology===

There are approximately of coquina rock outcrops frequently exposed along the low-tide line of the city&#x27;s ocean beach. The National Marine Fisheries Service has classified the rock as an Essential Fish Habitat-Habitat Area of Particular Concern. It is important to aquatic life and found only in a few locations along the Eastern seaboard.

On the city&#x27;s ocean beach can be found fossil Atlantic ghost crabs, the remnants of a unique set of geological circumstances which preserved these creatures when they died in their burrows perhaps about 110,000 years ago.

There are significant deposits of sand, marl, coquina and possibly phosphate within the city limits.

In the summer of 2018, Erin Brockovich hosted a town hall to address citizens concerns that ground contamination from an old military dump was causing increased rates of cancer. These concerns were validated when County health officials released a report the following summer that showed a higher incidence of some rare cancers and again when the U.S. Department of Defense designated an area just blocks north of the city as a &quot;Formerly Used Defense Site&quot;. While no direct link between the cancer cases and contamination had been established as of January 2020, officials and activists were still working on the issue. A renewed interest in this issue was prompted when an oncologist who graduated from Satellite High School in 2003 noticed that an unusually high number of her classmates were getting cancer and dying.

== Satellite Beach Library ==
During the 1960s, Brevard county&#x27;s population soared due to the Aerospace program and the demands on libraries increased, resulting in the need for more branches. There were many members of the community that expressed the need for a branch in Satellite Beach. A site was selected by the City of Satellite Beach on Cassia Boulevard. A head librarian was selected to run the branch with a volunteer staff. The library&#x27;s initial budget was $50,000. The Satellite Beach Public Library opened on April 17, 1966. The location eventually outgrew the initial building. In 1991, a new 19,000 square foot facility was completed for the Satellite Beach Public Library at the site of the old Indian Harbor Beach Sewer Treatment Plant property. The land was purchased by the County at a cost of $75,000 and increased the size of the library from 6,500 square feet to 19,000 square feet. The new facility opened on September 23, 1991 on Jamaica Boulevard.

Beach ‘Nourishment’

Every five years Brevard County conduct a dune renourishment project on the beach in an effort to preserve the natural coastline.” While proponents of beach renourishment defend the action as a way to preserve the natural coastline, prevent coastal armoring of properties, and protect natural sea turtle nesting habitat; some residents who oppose it say it&#x27;s wasteful and ruins the quality of the beach.

The destruction of the 1960s-era plant paved the way for U.S.-produced natural gas-fired plants. In 2011, construction was started on $1.1 billion gas-fired plants. Up to 600 workers were employed for the construction.

The Brevard County Jail Complex is located in Sharpes. It is owned and maintained by the Board of County Commissioners and operated by the Brevard County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. The jail is accredited through the Florida Corrections Accreditation Commission. The main jail opened in 1986 with beds for 386 inmates. Currently the Jail Complex routinely houses over 1,800 inmates daily with 1,321 permanent inmate beds. There has been a jail as long as there has been a sheriff and a county court. The jail was formerly located in Titusville, Florida, in the Courthouse complex. In 2013, the jail re-introduced chain gangs as a deterrent on crime in a pilot project. Ex-convict Larry Lawton was critical of this, saying a better use of law enforcement resources would be to combat drug addiction because he says it is a &quot;contributing factor&quot; to criminal activity.
The Brevard Correctional Institution is located west of the county jail. Despite its name, it is operated by the state. It was built in 1977. It houses up to 1,000 inmates. It employs 238 people. In 2010, it cost $30.8 million to operate. In 2011, it needed $6.2 million to repair. The state decided to close it in March 2011.

<text>Titusville is a city in and the county seat of Brevard County, Florida, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 48,789, up from 43,761 at the 2010 census. Titusville is located along the Indian River, west of Merritt Island and the Kennedy Space Center, and south-southwest of the Canaveral National Seashore. It is a principal city of the Palm Bay–Melbourne–Titusville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Near Titusville is the Windover Archeological Site, a National Historic Landmark recognizing its important collection of human remains and artifacts of the early Archaic Period (6,000 to 5,000 BC.). A secondary, &quot;de facto&quot; county seat was established beginning in 1989, at Viera, Florida, in the geographic center of the county, to better serve the more populous southern portion of the county.

==History==
Indigenous peoples had inhabited this area for thousands of years, as shown by discovery in 1982 of the Windover Archeological Site, dating to the early Archaic Period (6000 to 5000 BC). It has been designated as a National Historic Landmark because of the significance of its remains.

At the time of European encounter, this area was inhabited by the Ais Indians, who gathered palmetto, cocoplum and seagrape berries. They also fished the Indian River, called the &quot;Rio de Ais&quot; by Spanish explorers. By 1760, however, the tribe had disappeared due largely to infectious disease, slave raids, and the disruptive effects of rum.

The United States acquired Florida from Spain in 1821, and the Seminole Wars delayed settlement of portions of the new territory.

This community was originally called Sand Point, and a post office was established in 1859, although it closed a few months later. Henry T. Titus arrived in 1867, intending to build a town on land owned by his wife, Mary Hopkins Titus, daughter of a prominent planter from Darien, Georgia. He laid out roads and in 1870 erected the Titus House, a large, one-story hotel next to a saloon. He also donated land for four churches and a courthouse, the latter an effort to get the town designated as county seat.

Local history says that Titus challenged Capt. Clark Rice to a game of dominoes to decide the name of the town. Titus won the game, and Sand Point was renamed as Titusville in 1873. The city was incorporated in 1887, the year construction began on St. Gabriel&#x27;s Episcopal Church, as listed in the 1972 National Register of Historic Places. At one point, Titusville was nicknamed &quot;The City of Churches&quot;.

The Atlantic Coast, St. Johns &amp; Indian River Railroad reached Titusville in 1885, constructed from Enterprise, Florida. It was connected by a spur line to the Jacksonville, Tampa &amp; Key West Railroad at Enterprise Junction in present-day DeBary, Florida. Henry Flagler extended his Florida East Coast Railroad south from Daytona, building a station at Titusville in 1892. Many tourists arrived by railroad to enjoy the mild winter climate.

In addition, the railroad was a means to ship area produce to northern markets, and the Indian River area increasingly became an agricultural and shipping center for pineapple and citrus goods. A wooden bridge was built east to Playalinda Beach in 1922.

In October 1918, Titusville officials were the first in the county to order closed all places of assembly, including schools, churches, and movies, to avoid spreading the Spanish flu.

Beginning in the late 1950s, the growth of Cape Canaveral, and later the Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, stimulated growth in the community&#x27;s economy, population and tourism. The association with the space program led to the city&#x27;s two nicknames in the 1960s: Space City USA and Miracle City.

Searstown Mall opened in 1966. Miracle City Mall opened in 1968, built on . It had of covered floor space.

The jail at the county courthouse became overcrowded by the 1980s. A new jailhouse was built in Sharpes in 1986.

&quot;Computer Shopper&quot; was founded in Titusville in 1979 by Glenn Patch, first as a tabloid. It was later expanded as a magazine of over 800 pages per issue. It was published in Titusville until September 1989. That year operations were to be moved to New York City in a joint venture between Patch Communications of Titusville and Ziff Davis.

The A. Max Brewer Bridge, a fixed high-level span on SR-406 connecting Titusville to Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge and Canaveral National Seashore, opened on February 5, 2011, to replace the former swing bridge built in 1949.

In May 2012, the Brevard County School Board closed Riverview Elementary School for budgetary reasons. It closed South Lake Elementary School on May 25, 2013.

In January 2013, Miracle City Mall closed, a victim of a declining local economy after the termination of the Space Shuttle program in 2012. In addition, county population had moved to the south, and changing shopping habits had adversely affected malls across the country. Demolition of Miracle City Mall occurred February 2015. The site has been redeveloped as a mixed-use outdoor shopping complex called Titus Landing.

Because of population decline, the USPS had closed two post offices in Titusville by 2013, and discussed closing a third.

<text>Coral Springs is a city in Broward County, Florida, United States. The city is located approximately northwest of Fort Lauderdale. As of the 2020 U.S. Census, the city had a population of 134,394. It is a principal city of the Miami metropolitan area in South Florida, which was home to an estimated 6,012,331 people at the 2015 census.

The city, officially chartered on July 10, 1963, was master-planned and primarily developed by Coral Ridge Properties, Inc., which was acquired by Westinghouse in 1966. The city&#x27;s name is derived from the company&#x27;s name, and was selected after several earlier proposals had been considered and rejected. Despite the name, there are no natural springs in the city; Florida&#x27;s springs are found in the central and northern portions of the state.

During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s the young city grew rapidly, adding over 35,000 residents each decade. Coral Springs has notably strict building codes, which are designed to maintain the city&#x27;s distinctive aesthetic appeal. The city government&#x27;s effective fiscal management has maintained high bond ratings, and the city has won accolades for its overall livability, its low crime rate, and its family-friendly orientation.

==History==
Coral Springs is a planned community. Prior to its incorporation as a city in July 1963, the area which is now Coral Springs was part of of marshy lands bought by Henry Lyons between 1911 and 1939. After several floods in 1947, Florida created the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control District (now the South Florida Water Management District). Canals and levees drained much of the area upon which Coral Springs was built. After the land was drained and cleared, most of the area was used as a bean farm. After Lyons&#x27; death in 1952, his heirs changed the focus to cattle.

A post-World War II real estate boom in South Florida attracted the interest of developers. Coral Ridge Properties, which already had several developments in Broward County, bought of land from the Lyons family on December 14, 1961, for $1 million. The City of Coral Springs was chartered on July 10, 1963. Other names that were considered for the new city included &quot;Curran Village,&quot; &quot;Pompano Springs&quot; and &quot;Quartermore&quot;. By 1964, the company had developed a master plan for a city of 50,000 residents. On July 22, 1964, the first sale of 536 building lots netted $1.6 million. The landmark covered bridge was built that same year to promote the town. In 1965, Coral Ridge Properties bought an additional from the Lyons family, increasing the city&#x27;s land area to . The first city government elections were held in 1967.

The city added 19 public schools, a regional mall, shopping centers and parks between 1970 and 2000 in response to rapid population growth. The biggest shopping mall in the city is Coral Square, which opened in October 1984 with of retail space and more than 120 stores. The construction of the Sawgrass Expressway in 1986 brought even more growth. A museum and a theater opened in the 1990s. The city reached residential build-out in 2003 and is very close to a commercial build-out.

==Geography==
The approximate coordinates for the City of Coral Springs is located at . According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and of which is water (0.83%). Coral Springs is bordered by the cities of Parkland to the north, Coconut Creek to the east, Margate and North Lauderdale to the southeast and Tamarac to the south. To the west lie The Everglades.

===Cityscape===
Coral Springs is a sprawling city, with few tall or prominent structures. The tallest building in the city is a 12-story condominium (Country Club Tower), with five more buildings topping out at or near 10 stories, including four office buildings lining University Drive, one of the city&#x27;s main roads. Buildings include the University Place at City Center, Coral Springs Executive Tower, Bank of America Center, and the Briarwood Towers. The Coral Springs Financial Plaza was the first major office building in the city; built in 1974 as the Bank of Coral Springs Building, it had 10 floors and 123,469 sq ft of office space; it was demolished in 2021. University Place at City Center, at 3111 N. University Drive, is the largest office building in the city in terms of office space—it has 10 floors and . It opened as the Preferred Exchange Tower in 1985.

Coral Ridge Properties established strict landscaping and sign laws for the city—a question in the original version of Trivial Pursuit noted that the city hosted the first McDonald&#x27;s without the distinctive Golden Arches sign. Restrictions on commercial signs, exterior paint colors, roofing materials, recreational vehicle and boat storage, and landscaping specifications are all strictly enforced; consequently, real estate values in the city are significantly higher than the county as a whole. In 2006, the median price of a single family home in Coral Springs was US$415,000, while the median price county-wide was US$323,000.

The city&#x27;s downtown at the intersection of Sample Road and University Drive is the focus of an extensive redevelopment plan, estimated to cost close to US$700 million. The plan to revitalize the city&#x27;s core started with an open-air shopping and entertainment center—&quot;The Walk&quot;—and progressed with the construction of &quot;One Charter Place,&quot; opened April 2007. When completed, the redeveloped downtown area will offer office, retail, and a new government center, encompassing approximately three million square feet of floor space, in addition to approximately 1,000 residential units and a new hotel. The city&#x27;s new $38 million city hall complex opened in January 2018, replacing the old building which was demolished later that year. The current downtown project in development, &quot;Cornerstone Downtown Coral Springs&quot;, will feature two residential towers, a hotel, and a shopping, office and entertainment complex. The project began construction in 2022, following the demolition of the Coral Springs Financial Plaza at the end of 2021.

The City of Coral Springs&#x27; Parks and Recreation Department operates over 50 municipal parks, including a water park and a skate park, encompassing over . Coral Springs&#x27; largest park is Mullins Park (70 acres). Of the four natural conservation areas in the city, Sandy Ridge Sanctuary is the biggest, at .

The hurricane season is from June to November, with September as the month during which hurricanes are most likely to occur. The most powerful hurricane to strike Coral Springs since its incorporation was Wilma in 2005; the eye of the hurricane passed directly over the city. The city estimated that &quot;as a result of the numerous hurricanes and storms that hit Coral Springs in 2004/2005, and especially as a result of Hurricane Wilma, the tree canopy coverage throughout the city has been reduced by about one third&quot;. A 2017 study put Coral Springs in fourth place for US cities most vulnerable to coastal flooding, with 115,000 residents living within FEMA&#x27;s coastal floodplain.

<text>Dania Beach (Dania until 1998) is a city in Broward County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Miami metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population was 31,723. Dania Beach is the location of one of the largest jai alai frontons in the United States, The Casino @ Dania Beach (Dania Jai Alai). It was formerly the location for two amusement centers; one named Boomers! (formerly Grand Prix Race-O-Rama), which housed the Dania Beach Hurricane roller coaster, and the other being Pirates World amusement park, which was featured in Barry Mahon&#x27;s &quot;Thumbelina&quot;. It is also home to the International Game Fish Association Hall of Fame and Museum.

==History==
The area was started as a neighborhood called Modello in the late 19th century. In November 1904, the area was incorporated as the &quot;Town of Dania&quot;, because most of the 35 residents were farmers of Danish ancestry. On January 4, 1926, Dania voted to annex itself to the City of Hollywood.

After the September 1926 Miami hurricane decimated Hollywood&#x27;s fortunes, most of Dania seceded from the City of Hollywood and reincorporated as a city. The areas that chose to remain part of the City of Hollywood caused Dania&#x27;s current noncontinuous city boundaries. In November 1998, the &quot;City of Dania&quot; formally changed its name to &quot;City of Dania Beach&quot;. The name &quot;Dania&quot; is still commonly used to refer to the city.

In 2001, the city annexed several unincorporated areas of Broward County, increasing its population by about 3,600 people.

Formerly known as the &quot;Tomato Capital of the World&quot;, once the city went from a farming settlement to an urban city, it soon took on the name &quot;Antique Capital of the South&quot;, due to many antique shops in downtown Dania Beach, especially along Federal Highway, known as the city&#x27;s &quot;Antique Row&quot;.

<text>Fort Lauderdale ( ) is a coastal city located in the U.S. state of Florida, north of Miami along the Atlantic Ocean. It is the county seat of and most populous city in Broward County with a population of 182,760 at the 2020 census, making it the tenth-most populous city in Florida. After Miami and Hialeah, Fort Lauderdale is the third-most populous city in the Miami metropolitan area, which had a population of 6,166,488 in 2019.

Built in 1838 and first incorporated in 1911, Fort Lauderdale is named after a series of forts built by the United States during the Second Seminole War. The forts took their name from Major William Lauderdale (1782–1838), younger brother of Lieutenant Colonel James Lauderdale. Development of the city did not begin until 50 years after the forts were abandoned at the end of the conflict. Three forts named &quot;Fort Lauderdale&quot; were constructed including the first at the fork of the New River, the second at Tarpon Bend on the New River between the present-day Colee Hammock and Rio Vista neighborhoods, and the third near the site of the Bahia Mar Marina.

Known as the &quot;Venice of America&quot;, Fort Lauderdale has 165 miles of inland waterways across the city. In addition to tourism, Fort Lauderdale has a diversified economy including marine, manufacturing, finance, insurance, real estate, high technology, avionics/aerospace, film, and television production. The city is a popular tourist destination with an average year-round temperature of and 3,000 hours of sunshine per year. Greater Fort Lauderdale, encompassing all of Broward County, hosted more than 13 million overnight visitors in 2018. Each year nearly four million cruise passengers pass through its Port Everglades, making it the third largest cruise port in the world. With over 50,000 registered yachts and 100 marinas, Fort Lauderdale is also known as the yachting capital of the world.&quot;

==History==

The area in which the city of Fort Lauderdale would later be founded was inhabited for more than two thousand years by the Tequesta Indians. Contact with Spanish explorers in the 16th century proved disastrous for the Tequesta, as the Europeans brought with them diseases, such as smallpox, to which the native populations possessed no resistance. For the Tequesta, disease, coupled with continuing conflict with their Calusa neighbors, contributed greatly to their decline over the next two centuries. By 1763, there were only a few Tequesta left in Florida, and most of them were evacuated to Cuba when the Spanish ceded Florida to the British in 1763, under the terms of the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Seven Years&#x27; War. Although control of the area changed between Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Confederate States of America, it remained largely undeveloped until the 20th century.

The Fort Lauderdale area was known as the &quot;New River Settlement&quot; before the 20th century. In the 1830s, there were approximately 70 settlers living along the New River. William Cooley, the local Justice of the Peace, was a farmer and wrecker, who traded with the Seminole Indians. On January 6, 1836, while Cooley was leading an attempt to salvage a wrecked ship, a band of Seminoles attacked his farm, killing his wife and children, and the children&#x27;s tutor. The other farms in the settlement were not attacked, but all the white residents in the area abandoned the settlement, fleeing first to the Cape Florida Lighthouse on Key Biscayne, and then to Key West.

The first United States stockade named Fort Lauderdale was built in 1838, and subsequently was a site of fighting during the Second Seminole War. The fort was abandoned in 1842, after the end of the war, and the area remained virtually unpopulated until the 1890s. It was not until Frank Stranahan arrived in the area in 1893 to operate a ferry across the New River, and the Florida East Coast Railroad&#x27;s completion of a route through the area in 1896, that any organized development began. The city was incorporated in 1911, and in 1915, was designated the county seat of newly formed Broward County.

Fort Lauderdale&#x27;s first major development began in the 1920s, during the Florida land boom. The Great Miami Hurricane of 1926 and the Great Depression of the 1930s caused a great deal of economic dislocation. In July 1935, an African-American man named Rubin Stacy was accused of robbing a white woman at knifepoint. He was arrested and being transported to a Miami jail when police were run off the road by a mob. A group of 100 white men proceeded to hang Stacy from a tree near the scene of his alleged robbery. His body was riddled with some 20 bullets. The murder was subsequently used by the press in Nazi Germany to discredit U.S. critiques of its own persecution of Jews, Communists, and Catholics.

When World War II began, Fort Lauderdale became a major U.S. base, with a Naval Air Station to train pilots, radar operators, and fire control operators. A Coast Guard base at Port Everglades was also established.

Until July 1961, only whites were allowed on Ft. Lauderdale beaches. There were no beaches for African-Americans in Broward County until 1954, when &quot;the Colored Beach,&quot; today Dr. Von D. Mizell-Eula Johnson State Park, was opened in Dania Beach; however, no road was built to it until 1965. On July 4, 1961, African Americans started a series of wade-ins as protests at beaches that were off-limits to them, to protest &quot;the failure of the county to build a road to the Negro beach.&quot; On July 11, 1962, a verdict by Ted Cabot went against the city&#x27;s policy of racial segregation of public beaches, and Broward County beaches were desegregated in 1962.

Today, Fort Lauderdale is a major yachting center, one of the nation&#x27;s largest tourist destinations, and the center of a metropolitan division with 1.8 million people.

===Population size===
After the war ended, service members returned to the area, spurring an enormous population explosion that dwarfed the 1920s boom. The 1960 census counted 83,648 people in the city, about 230% of the 1950 figure. A 1967 report estimated that the city was approximately 85% developed, and the 1970 population figure was 139,590.

After 1970, growth in the area shifted to suburbs to the west. As cities such as Coral Springs, Miramar, and Pembroke Pines experienced explosive growth, Fort Lauderdale&#x27;s population stagnated, and the city actually shrank by almost 4,000 people between 1980, when the city had 153,279 people, and 1990, when the population was 149,377. A slight rebound brought the population back up to 152,397 at the 2000 census. Since 2000, Fort Lauderdale has gained slightly over 18,000 residents through annexation of seven neighborhoods in unincorporated Broward County.

==Geography==

===Location===
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and of which is water (9.87%). Fort Lauderdale is known for its extensive network of canals; there are of waterways within the city limits.

The city of Fort Lauderdale is adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean, includes of beaches, and borders the following municipalities:


On its east:
* Lauderdale-by-the-Sea
* Sea Ranch Lakes
On its south:
* Hollywood
* Dania Beach
On its southwest:
* Davie
On its west:
* Plantation
* Lauderhill
* Lauderdale Lakes
On its northwest:
* North Lauderdale
* Oakland Park
* Tamarac
On its north:
* Wilton Manors
* Pompano Beach

The northwestern section of Fort Lauderdale is separate from the remainder of the city, connected only by the Cypress Creek Canal as it flows under I-95. This section of Fort Lauderdale borders the cities of Tamarac and Oakland Park on its south side. Oakland Park also borders Fort Lauderdale on the west side of its northeastern portion. The greater portion of Fort Lauderdale in the south is bordered, along its north side by Wilton Manors.

Off the coast of Fort Lauderdale is the Osborne Reef, an artificial reef made of discarded tires that has proven to be an ecological disaster. The dumping began in the 1960s, with the intent of providing habitat for fish, while disposing of trash from the land. However, in the rugged and corrosive environment of the ocean, nylon straps used to secure the tires wore out, cables rusted, and tires broke free. The tires posed a particular threat after breaking free from their restraints. The tires then migrated shoreward, and ran into a living reef tract, washed up on its slope, and killed many things in their path. In recent years, thousands of tires have also washed up on nearby beaches, especially during hurricanes. Local authorities are now working to remove the 700,000 tires, in cooperation with the U.S. Army, Navy, and Coast Guard.

===Neighborhoods===

Fort Lauderdale has a program for designating and recognizing neighborhoods.

==Demographics==

Fort Lauderdale is the second-largest city in the Miami metropolitan area and the largest city in Broward County, holding nearly a tenth of the county&#x27;s population. It grew at a fast pace throughout the first seventy years of the twentieth century, with its population expanding from 91 in 1900 to 139,590 in 1970.

In the 1980s, the population of the city shrank for the first time, and by the 1990 census the number of residents of Fort Lauderdale fell just below 150,000. The next decade saw a slight rebound, but by the time of the 2000 census, the city&#x27;s population was at 152,397, still below its first peak in 1980.

The current mayor of Fort Lauderdale, Dean Trantalis, is the first openly gay person to hold this office.

==Economy==

Fort Lauderdale&#x27;s economy has diversified over time. From the 1940s through the 1980s, the city was known as a spring break destination for college students. The college crowd has since dwindled, however, with the city now attracting wealthier tourists. Cruise ships and nautical recreation provide the basis for much of the revenue raised by tourism. There is a convention center west of the beach and southeast of downtown, with of space, including a main exhibit hall. Approximately 30% of the city&#x27;s 10 million annual visitors attend conventions at the center.

The downtown area, especially around Las Olas Boulevard, first underwent redevelopment starting in 2002, and now hosts many new hotels and high-rise condominium developments. The city&#x27;s central business district is the largest downtown in Broward County, although there are other cities in the county with commercial centers. Office buildings and high-rises include: Las Olas River House, Las Olas Grand, 110 Tower (formerly AutoNation Tower), Bank of America Plaza, One Financial Plaza, Broward Financial Center, One East Broward Boulevard, Barnett Bank Plaza, PNC Center, New River Center, One Corporate Center, SunTrust Centre, 101 Tower, and SouthTrust Tower.

Fort Lauderdale is a major manufacturing and maintenance center for yachts. The boating industry is responsible for over 109,000 jobs in the county.

Additionally, the annual Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show, the world&#x27;s largest boat show, brings over 125,000 people to the city each year.

===Top employers===

According to the Greater Fort Lauderdale Alliance 2020 report, the city&#x27;s top employers include:

==Arts and culture==
Like many parts of Florida, the city&#x27;s population has a strong seasonal variation, as &quot;snowbirds&quot; from the northern United States, Canada, and Europe spend the winter and spring in Florida. The city is known for its beaches, bars, nightclubs, and history as a spring break location, back in the 1960s and 1970s, for tens of thousands of college students. The city has discouraged college students from visiting the area since the mid-1980s, however, by passing strict laws aimed at preventing the mayhem that occurred in the 1970s and 1980s. The city had an estimated 350,000 college visitors for spring break 1985; by 1989, that number had declined to about 20,000. Since the 1990s, Fort Lauderdale has increasingly catered to those seeking the resort lifestyle seasonally or year-round, and is often a host city to many professional venues, concerts, and art shows.

Fort Lauderdale&#x27;s arts and entertainment district, otherwise known as the Riverwalk Arts &amp; Entertainment District, runs east–west along Las Olas Boulevard, from the beach to the heart of downtown. The district is anchored in the West by the Broward Center for the Performing Arts, and runs through the city to the intersection of Las Olas and A1A. This intersection is the &quot;ground zero&quot; of Fort Lauderdale Beach, and is the site of the Elbo Room bar featured in the 1960 film &quot;Where the Boys Are&quot;, which led in large measure to the city&#x27;s former reputation as a spring break mecca. The city and its suburbs host over 4,100 restaurants and over 120 nightclubs, many of them in the arts and entertainment district. The city is also the setting for the 1986 movie &quot;Flight of the Navigator&quot;, and host of Langerado, an annual music festival. In 2013, the county welcomed about 1.3 million LGBT travelers who spent about $1.5 billion in area restaurants, hotels, attractions, and shops, according to the Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau.

===Film festival===

The Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival has been presented annually since 1986.

It will become the headquarters and training center for the Association of Pickleball Players.

==Government==
Fort Lauderdale has a commission-manager form of government. City policy is set by a city commission of five elected members: the mayor and four district commission members. In 1998, the municipal code was amended to limit the mayoral term. The mayor of Fort Lauderdale now serves a three-year term, and cannot serve more than three consecutive terms. The current mayor is Dean Trantalis, who succeeded Jack Seiler in 2018. The longest-serving mayor is Jim Naugle, who served from 1991 to 2009. Administrative functions are performed by a city manager, who is appointed by the city commission. Fort Lauderdale Fire-Rescue Department provides Fire and Emergency Medical Services.

The town of Fort Lauderdale council in 1911 appointed Kossie A. Goodbread as its first City Marshal. G. D. Tenbrook, appointed Marshal in 1920, was the first to receive the title of Chief of Police. Between 1924 and 1926, the size of the Fort Lauderdale Police Department increased from two officers to 26 officers. Scott Israel, later the Sheriff of Broward County and the Opa-locka Police Chief, worked for the Fort Lauderdale Police Department from 1979 to 2004. As of 2022, the department had 499 officers.

==Education==

Additionally, 27.9% held at least a baccalaureate, slightly higher than the national figure of 24.4%. Broward County Public Schools operates 23 public schools in Fort Lauderdale. The 2007 Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT) results for Fort Lauderdale&#x27;s public schools were mixed; while 10 (of 16) elementary schools and one (of four) middle schools received &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; grades, Sunland Park Elementary School and Arthur Ashe Middle School received failing grades. Boyd Anderson High School, which is in Lauderdale Lakes but whose attendance zone includes part of Fort Lauderdale, also received a failing grade. None of the three failing schools have failed twice in a four-year period, thus triggering the &quot;Opportunity Scholarship Program&quot; school choice provisions of the Florida&#x27;s education plan.

Ten institutions of higher learning have main or satellite campuses in the city:
* The Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale
* Broward College BC (Willis Holcombe Downtown Center)

==Transportation==
===Transit===
Broward County Transit (BCT), the county bus system, provides local bus transportation. BCT provides for connections with the bus systems in other parts of the metropolitan area: Metrobus in Dade County, and Palm Tran in Palm Beach County. Tri-Rail, a commuter rail system, connects south Florida&#x27;s major cities and airports. In November 2006, Broward County voters rejected a one-cent-per-hundred sales tax increase intended to fund transportation projects, such as light rail and bus system expansion.
The Wave, a new electric streetcar system costing $125 million, was being planned for the downtown. Most of the construction funding would have come from federal ($62.5 million), state ($37 million), and city taxpayers ($10.5 million), with approximately $15 million from assessments on properties within the Downtown Development Authority. Broward County (BCT) had committed to operating the system for the first 10 years at an expected annual cost of $2 million, and had guaranteed funding to cover any shortfall in ridership revenues. The construction cost of $50 million per mile was considerably higher than other recently built streetcar projects, in part due to the challenges of building an electric transit system over the 3rd Avenue drawbridge. The project was canceled in 2018 by the city and the county.

Amtrak provides long-distance passenger service daily on the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; and &quot;Silver Star&quot; lines connecting to cities on the Atlantic coast via the Fort Lauderdale station.

===Airports===


Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport, near Dania Beach, Florida, is the city&#x27;s main airport and is the fastest-growing major airport in the country as of 2005. This was, in part, attributable to service by low-cost carriers, such as Spirit Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, and Silver Airways, resulting in lower airfares than nearby Miami International Airport.

Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood is an emerging international gateway for the Caribbean and Latin America. Miami International Airport and Palm Beach International Airport also serve the city.

===Waterways===
Fort Lauderdale is home to Port Everglades, the nation&#x27;s third busiest cruise port. It is Florida&#x27;s deepest port, and is an integral petroleum receiving point. Fort Lauderdale is served by a regular international passenger ferry service to Freeport, Grand Bahama Island, Bahamas operated by Baleària Caribbean.

===Roads===
Broward County is served by three major interstate highways (I-75, I-95, I-595) and U.S. Highways, such as U.S. 1, US 27 and US 441. The interchange between I-95 and I-595/SR 862 is known as the Rainbow Interchange. It is also served by Florida&#x27;s Turnpike and State Highway 869, also known as the Sawgrass Expressway.

==Healthcare==

Fort Lauderdale is served by Broward General Medical Center and Imperial Point Medical Center, which are operated by Broward Health, the third-largest hospital consortium in the United States. Broward General is a 716-bed acute care facility that is designated as a Level I trauma center. It is also home to Chris Evert Children&#x27;s Hospital and a Heart Center of Excellence. The hospital serves as a major training site for medical students from Nova Southeastern University&#x27;s College of Osteopathic Medicine, as well as nursing and paramedic programs from throughout the area.

<text>Hallandale Beach (formerly known simply as Hallandale) is a city in southern Broward County, Florida, United States. The city is named after Luther Halland, the son of a Swedish worker for Henry Flagler&#x27;s Florida East Coast Railroad. It is also part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. As of the 2023 census, the population was 41,547.

The city is known as the home of Gulfstream Park (horse racing and casino) and Big Easy Casino, a greyhound racing track which hosts the World Classic. It also has a sizable downtown financial district with banks, brokerage houses and restaurants. Together with neighbouring Hollywood, Florida, it is a popular centre for Canadian tourists, leading to its description as &quot;Canada&#x27;s southernmost city.&quot;

==History==
Railroad magnate Henry Flagler, owner of the Florida East Coast Railway, recruited Luther Halland, a brother-in-law of Flagler&#x27;s agents, to found a settlement south of the community of Dania. Halland and Swedish immigrant Olaf Zetterlund touted the frost-free climate and cheap land of the settlement (then named Halland, later changed to Hallandale). Halland constructed a small trading post and became the first postmaster of the small community.

By 1900, the community had slowly grown to a dozen families—seven of Swedish, three of English, and two of African American descent. In 1904 the first school was built, and the first church followed two years later. Hallandale was primarily a farming community.

Hallandale was incorporated on May 11, 1927, the eighth municipality in Broward County. By that time, a thriving community of 1,500 residents, with electricity and street lights, was in place. In 1947, the Town of Hallandale was reincorporated as the City of Hallandale, allowing it to expand its borders through annexation of nearby unincorporated land lying adjacent to the Atlantic shore. On August 27, 1999, the city officially changed its name to Hallandale Beach.

Hurricane Katrina first made landfall between Hallandale Beach and Aventura, Florida.
