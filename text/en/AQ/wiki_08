<text>Ajo ( ) is an unincorporated community in Pima County, Arizona, United States. It is the closest community to Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. The population was 3,039 at the 2020 census. Ajo is located on State Route 85 just from the Mexican border.

==History==
&quot;Ajo&quot; is the Spanish word for garlic (). The Spanish may have named the place using the familiar word in place of the similar-sounding O&#x27;odham word for paint (&quot;oʼoho&quot;). The Tohono O&#x27;odham people obtained red paint pigments from the area.

Native Americans, Spaniards, and Americans have all extracted mineral wealth from Ajo&#x27;s abundant ore deposits. In the early nineteenth century, there was a Spanish mine nicknamed &quot;Old Bat Hole&quot; that was abandoned due to Indian raids. Tom Childs, Sr., found the deserted mine complete with a shaft, mesquite ladders, and rawhide buckets in 1847. He did not stay long at that time, because he was on his way to the silver mines near Magdalena de Kino, Sonora.

Thirty-five years later, Childs and his son returned with a friend and started developing the abandoned mine.

In the year 1884, the camp at Ajo was practically abandoned. Not a soul was in camp when Tom Childs Sr., and his son arrived. With them was Washington Michael Jacobs of Tucson, Arizona ... Childs and Jacobs located the mining claim which constituted most of the old Ajo group of mines. They made a permanent camp and worked the mines.

High-grade native copper made Ajo the first copper mine in Arizona. Soon the Arizona Mining &amp; Trading company, formed by Peter R. Brady, a friend of Childs, worked the rich surface ores, shipping loads around Cape Horn for smelting in Swansea, Wales, in the mid-1880s. The mine closed when a ship sank off the coast of Patagonia. Long supply lines and the lack of water discouraged large mining companies

With the advent of new recovery methods for low-grade ore, Ajo boomed. In 1911, Col. John Campbell Greenway, a Rough Rider and star Yale athlete, bought the New Cornelia mine from John Boddie. He became general manager of the Calumet and the Arizona mining company and expanded it on a grand scale. The Tucson, Cornelia and Gila Bend Railroad was built from Gila Bend to serve the mining industry and was in service from 1916 to 1985. In 1921, Phelps Dodge, the nation&#x27;s largest copper company, bought New Cornelia and the mine became the New Cornelia Branch of Phelps Dodge, managed by Michael Curley. For several decades more than 1,000 employees worked for Phelps Dodge in the open pit mine. In 1983 union-affiliated mine employees went on strike. The mine continued with non-union labor for a short while before stopping production in 1985.

The town was originally segregated, with neighborhoods called Indian Village and Mexican Town for the non-white residents. Ajo is home to many retired people, Border Patrol agents, and young families.

During the construction of a new border wall in 2019–2020, many workers lived in the RV parks, hotels and rental houses.

<doc id="106707" wikidata="Q79406" url="?curid=106707" title="Casas Adobes, Arizona">
<text>Casas Adobes (Spanish: &quot;Adobe Houses&quot;) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located in the northern metropolitan area of Tucson, Arizona (in Pima County). The population was 66,795 at the 2010 census. Casas Adobes is situated south and southwest of the town of Oro Valley, and west of the community of Catalina Foothills.

The attempted assassination of Representative Gabby Giffords, and the murders of chief judge for the U.S. District Court for Arizona, John Roll, and five other people on January 8, 2011, took place at a Safeway supermarket in Casas Adobes.

==History==
Though Casas Adobes is an unincorporated community, it is older than both the towns of Oro Valley and Marana.

The area bordering the Cañada del Oro in the north, and the Rillito River in the south was primarily inhabited and utilized by cattle ranchers. Cattle ranches dominated the Casas Adobes area until the 1920s, when Tucson had grown far enough north and the advent of the automobile made the area more easily accessible.

One of the first individuals to build a home in the area was Maurice L. Reid, who came to Tucson in 1923 seeking a &quot;walking cure&quot; for tuberculosis. In the late 1920s Reid bought a former ranch, bounded by North Oracle Road to the east, Orange Grove Road to the south, Ina Road to the north, and North La Cholla Boulevard to the west. Reid planted more than of citrus trees and date palms, that would become the heart of Tucson&#x27;s citrus industry. Over the years, Reid sold parcels of land for home sites, and in 1950 he sold the last of his land. Some larger residential estates continue to maintain the remaining citrus groves and orchards nearly a century later.

Leonie Boutall, who relocated to Arizona from Tennessee, decided to build a guest ranch in the early 1930s. The dry climate, her doctor told her, would relieve her bronchial troubles. Boutall bought of former ranch land just west of North Oracle Road, and south of a narrow dirt track now called Orange Grove Road. She built Rancho Nezhone, a luxury guest ranch that drew the rich and famous to the sparsely settled area far north of Tucson. Kate Smith, Liberace, Gen. John Pershing and William &quot;Hopalong Cassidy&quot; Boyd were guests of the desert retreat which featured lush vegetation with monkeys and parrots. Boutall sold out of the property in 1948. Today the site is home to Mission Palms Apartments, where much of the original flora and several features remain, including a 300-stone wall in front of the property.

Sam Nanini and Giaconda, his wife, moved to Tucson in 1948 seeking to cure Giaconda Nanini&#x27;s bronchial asthma. Beginning in the mid-1950s, the Italian born, transplanted Chicagoan developed three residential subdivisions on about that became the heart of the Casas Adobes community, giving the community its name. The subdivisions, along with Sam Nanini&#x27;s landmark Casas Adobes Plaza, were considered by many to be Tucson&#x27;s first suburb. Most of the homes in the subdivision are large ranch-style homes built with adobe bricks. Sam Nanini and his son William also later built the world-class Tucson National Resort, and the million-dollar residential subdivision, the Tucson National Estates.

===1997 incorporation attempt===
In 1997, the Arizona legislature passed a law that suspended the ability of incorporated cities and towns in Pima County to prevent the incorporation of other cities within six miles of their borders for a period of approximately two years. That same year, the residents of Casas Adobes voted to incorporate as their own city. However, a series of appeals overturned the new law on constitutional grounds, and the Superior Court annulled the incorporation. A second vote for incorporation in 2001 failed 56 to 44 percent.

Casas Adobes community has grown to encompass a area inhabited by nearly 60,000 residents. While Casas Adobes&#x27; neighboring municipalities of Oro Valley, Marana and Tucson continue to build new homes and shopping centers, Casas Adobes is mostly built out. With the failure of incorporation attempts, it is likely that one or all three of the neighboring entities will annex portions of Casas Adobes in the future.

===2011 shooting===
On January 8, 2011, 19 people were shot during a Congresswoman&#x27;s meeting in a Safeway grocery store parking lot. Six people were killed, including a federal judge, John Roll, and a congressional aide. U.S. Representative for , Gabby Giffords, was shot in the head at close range. A 22-year-old local man named as Jared Lee Loughner was arrested in connection with the incident.

==Geography==
Casas Adobes is located at (32.346368, −111.009844).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 22.6 square miles (58.6 km2), of which 22.6 square miles (58.6 km2) is land and 0.04% is water.

==Points of interest==
Casas Adobes is the location of one of southern Arizona&#x27;s largest and most biologically diverse nature preserves. Tohono Chul Park is a private nature park located northwest of North Oracle and West Ina roads on North Paseo del Norte. Tohono Chul, Tohono O&#x27;odham for &quot;desert corner,&quot; was created in 1985 after Richard and Jane Wilson dedicated their historic home and property to the preservation of the desert and the education of visitors on the splendor of the native plants and wildlife.

Casas Adobes features one of the highest concentrations of Mid-century modern architecture in the Tucson area with many prominent architects including Friedman and Jobusch, Nicholas Sakellar, Tom Gist, and Edward Nelson designing properties in the region. Notable examples include Saint Odilia Catholic Church, St Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church, Dove of Peace Lutheran Church, Arizona Bank (now Bank of America) as well as numerous residences in Catalina Village, Westward Look Estates, Casas Adobes Estates and Samalayuca Estates among other neighborhoods.

The Casas Adobes Plaza is a retail destination, dating back to 1948. The Plaza is situated on the southwest corner of North Oracle and West Ina roads, and features some of the most authentic Mediterranean architecture in the area. Original Italian vignettes, statues, and fountains are incorporated into the plaza. Casas Adobes Plaza has a historic Mediterranean observation tower.

Westward Look Resort is located in Casas Adobes, beginning in the early 20th century as a dude ranch in the foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains north of Tucson. The property was significantly expanded in the late 1960s by modernist architect Edward Nelson and became the Tucson area&#x27;s first resort. The original adobe home commissioned by ranch founders William and Maria Watson in the 1910s by Tucson architect Merritt Starkweather remains the heart of Westward Look Resort and is named the &quot;Vigas Room.&quot;

Casas Adobes has a nationally prominent golf resort built in the 1960s by Sam Nanini, the Omni Tucson National Resort. Hosting the PGA Tour Tucson Open for more than forty years, golfers Jack Nicklaus (who was discovered and promoted by Nanini), Arnold Palmer, Lee Trevino, Tom Watson, Tom Kite and Johnny Miller have played at Tucson National. Early tournaments were celebrity-hosted by Dean Martin and others.

While Casas Adobes remains unincorporated, the community has distinguished itself from the other suburbs to the north and northwest of Tucson as the oldest community.

==History==
Much of Catalina&#x27;s history and the land it now sits on is connected with the Golder Ranch. Lloyd Golder III and family moved to Tucson from Illinois in 1956 and by the following year had purchased the Rancho Vistoso, which at the time was a 4,800 acre ranch. In 1959, Golder bought the nearby 18,000-acre, Rail N. Ranch from Roberta Nicholas whose ranch house is now the administration building for the Miraval Resort. The land included parts of what is now Catalina State Park to the south and part of the land where Biosphere 2 now sits, to the north.

From 1961 to 1964 he built the Golder Dam about 4 miles north of the Pinal County line but in a legal action that lasted several decades it was declared unsafe and the lakeside community that would have been called Lago del Oro, was never built. The Saddlebrooke subdivision now occupies that land and only the Lago Del Oro Parkway still exists as a reminder of the failed community. He later developed the Twin Lakes subdivision and the Rail N. Ranch subdivision on his land as well as naming many of the streets on his land.

Around 1976, Chief H.D &quot;Bob&quot; and Della Murray, started Golder Ranch Fire District and retired in 1993. The land for the fire district headquarters, was donated by Lloyd Golder and his brother in law Jim McLaughlin. The new fire department was named after Golder Ranch. Golder&#x27;s wife Vicki Cox Golder has served on Golder Ranch Fire District Board for many years.

Lloyd Golder III died in 2013. The ranch commonly known as Golder Ranch is legally still called the Rail N. Ranch and is still an active open-range ranch.

==Governmental representation==
Catalina is in Arizona&#x27;s 6th Congressional District, served by Representative, Juan Ciscomani, a Republican. The CDP is also in Arizona&#x27;s 11th State Legislative District, served by Representatives Mark Finchem and Vince Leach and Senator Steve Smith, all Republicans.

<text>Catalina Foothills is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located north of Tucson in Pima County, Arizona, United States. Situated in the southern foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains, Catalina Foothills had a population of 50,796 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Modern development of the Catalina Foothills dates back to the early 1920s. Prior to that time, the Catalina Foothills area was primarily federal trust land and open range for cattle grazing. Beginning in the 1920s, John Murphey began purchasing property north of River Road in the foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains.

Murphey originally planned to develop 10 housing subdivisions with large lots. Murphey&#x27;s vision for the Catalina Foothills community was low-density residential development, on lots designed for maximum privacy, preserving existing desert vegetation, the natural terrain, and mountain views. In 1928 Murphey bought a tract of land north of River Road between North Oracle Road and Sabino Canyon in a federal land auction.

Around the same time, Josias Joesler, a Swiss architect, was retained to implement John Murphey&#x27;s vision. Residential development in the Catalina Foothills began in the 1930s, and Joesler designed a number of the homes.

In 1931, residents of the Foothills organized the Catalina Foothills School District to serve the local school-aged population. Murphey sold the school district the land for the first school building near East River Road and North Campbell Avenue, and Joesler designed the first school building. This building continues to house the school district&#x27;s administration.

In 1936, Joesler and Murphey completed the building of St. Philip&#x27;s in the Hills Episcopal Church at the corner of Campbell Avenue and River Road, which was then the main entrance to the Catalina Foothills Estates, an example of Spanish Colonial Mission architecture. The land for the church was donated by Murphey, and Joesler donated his services for its design. The congregation paid only for construction.

The Catalina Foothills’ population continued to expand, as development continued northward on the Oracle Road corridor, and eastward along the Ina Road/Skyline Drive corridor. In 1963, the Skyline Country Club was established. In the 1980s, both La Paloma Resort and Ventana Canyon Resort were established.

While the Catalina Foothills community supports a population exceeding 50,000, most of the neighborhoods maintain a low-density and suburban character.

==Geography==
The Catalina Foothills area is defined as north of River Road, east of Oracle Road, and west of Sabino Creek. The Catalina Foothills community is bounded to the north by the Santa Catalina Ranger District of the Coronado National Forest.

Freeport McMoRan&#x27;s Sierrita mine is located in Green Valley and is one of the town&#x27;s largest employers and is involved in investing in the community.

==Transportation==

==Water sustainability==

According to a 2007 report by Pima County, of water was pumped from the aquifer in the Upper Santa Cruz Valley in 2006, with 85 percent of that water being used for mining and agriculture. The remaining 15 percent was split between water used for golf courses and residential/commercial water use. The report explains that &quot;The Green Valley area does not have a sustainable water supply given current groundwater pumping rates... the water table in Green Valley has been declining in past years, and is expected to decline even faster as water demands [continue to increase]...&quot;. The report concludes that &quot;Water supplies will become critical within the next ten years.&quot;

The original 2007 report from Pima County contained a number of recommendations. Four out of five of the recommendations suggested taking advantage the &quot;Central Arizona Project (CAP) renewable water supplies, as well as recharge of the same&quot;. The report states, &quot;the size of a pipeline that would convey Central Arizona Project water for direct use or recharge for the entire Upper Basin would need to be at least 72 inches in diameter.&quot; As of 2017 one 36&quot; CAP pipeline has been completed with a second 36&quot; CAP pipeline slated for completion in the later part of 2017. (Note, however, that two 36-inch pipes provide only one half the capacity of a single 72-inch pipe, because capacity scales with cross-sectional area, not with diameter.)

The Upper Santa Cruz Valley has several major water users, all pumping water out of the same aquifer. Most area water users are for-profit companies. ASARCO-Mission Mine, Freeport-McMoRan Sierrita Mine and Farmers Investment Co. (farming) are industrial scale water users. Residential water is provided by Farmers Water Company, Sahuarita Water Company, Las Quintas Serenas Water Company, Quail Creek Water Company, Community Water Company of Green Valley (a nonprofit member owned cooperative), and the Green Valley Water District (a governmental water utility). The proliferation of water companies can be partially explained by the fact that Arizona water law places few limits on the amount of water that can be pumped with costs limited only to drilling, pumping, distribution, etc. Since 2007 the Upper Santa Cruz Providers and Users Group (USCPUG) has been working to bring all local water entities, including the Town of Sahuarita, to the same table. Most of the water users and utilities are now members of USCPUG. The organization has published an analysis and projection of area water use through 2030. It has joined with the U S Bureau of Reclamation to lay the groundwork for transportation and use of Colorado River water from the Central Arizona Project canal to greatly reduce reliance on pumping groundwater. If a system is successfully completed, the excess pumping will be largely or fully eliminated. The process through design and construction is expected to take several years with funding being the major challenge.

==Attractions==
In 2005 Green Valley was the host of the SAE Mini Baja 100 competition. Mini Baja vehicles are custom made by students. In this case there were about 60 teams from various universities, including some from Canada. ETS – École de technologie supérieure of the Université du Québec, from Montreal, Quebec, Canada, won the competition.

Green Valley is home to the Titan Missile Museum, America&#x27;s largest nuclear weapons museum.

==Education==
The CDP is in the Continental Elementary School District.

<text>Marana () is a town that mostly lies in Pima County with a small portion in Pinal County, in the U.S. state of Arizona. It is located northwest of Tucson, Arizona. As of the 2020 census, the population of the town was 51,908.

==History==
Archaeologists found evidence of about 4,200 years of continuous human settlement in the vicinity of Marana and in the middle of Santa Cruz Valley. Many significant archaeological sites have been found near Marana.
* Las Capas, a large, early agricultural site, is related to the nearby Costello-King site near present-day Ina Road and the Interstate 10 interchange. It was occupied from 4,200 to 2,500 years ago. It is the site of the oldest-known cemetery in the American Southwest and the oldest-known canals in North America. The oldest tobacco pipes in the world were found here.
* Marana Mound, dating between 1150 and 1300 A.D., is the remnant of a large platform mound that was the center of the Hohokam community. The people lived between the Santa Cruz River and the Tortolita Mountains. The mound is surrounded by an adobe compound wall. Multiple rooms were constructed against the wall and were associated with 30–35 nearby residential compounds. Multiple house features have been found both inside and outside the compounds, as well as wall segments and trash mounds. The whole complex covers an area of approximately one square mile.
* Linda Vista Hill, dating between 1200 and 1350 A.D., is a Trincheras culture site in the Tucson Mountains. The people inhabited mountain slopes overlooking arable land along streams. The hillside site has more than 150 terraces and 75 pit houses excavated into the terraces. A massive, adobe-walled compound is located on the hill summit.
* Los Morteros, a Hohokam ballcourt village ruin, is located on the Santa Cruz floodplain near the Point of the Mountain at the northern end of the Tucson Mountains. Los Morteros has also been identified as the probable location of the Llano del Azotado campsite used by the Juan Bautista de Anza expedition in 1775, which was chronicled. The location is near the present-day Arizona Portland Cement Plant in the Town of Marana.
* In 1775, Juan Bautista de Anza, Captain of the Presidio of Tubac, led an expedition north along the Santa Cruz River to find the city of San Francisco. His group of about 200 included 30 soldiers and their families and a number of escorts. They brought more than 1,000 heads of livestock. Their campsite was developed in the 20th century as the CalPortland Cement Plant near Marana. A segment of the route that the expedition took through Marana is designated as part of the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail.
* Pointer Mountain Station, of the Butterfield Overland Mail stagecoach line used from 1858, was found during the study of Los Morteros, within the limits of the nearby Puerta del Norte trailer court.

Spanish colonists began to inhabit this area in the 17th and 18th centuries. Over time they intermarried with Native Americans, and a class of mestizo settlers also developed. From the early years, mining and ranching were the chief economic activities. The area became part of the independent Mexican Empire established in 1821 (soon replaced by the Republic of Mexico).

===US territory===
More than two decades later, the United States acquired this territory as part of the Gadsden Purchase; it was not part of the Mexican Cession following the defeat in the Mexican-American War, ending in 1848.

===20th-century pioneers===
According to historian David Leighton, Charles B. Anway was the first member of the Anway family in the Tucson area; from the eastern United States, he came because the dry mountain air was thought to be beneficial for people suffering from tuberculosis, as he was. Antibiotics were not yet in general use to treat this disease, which had a high mortality rate and no known cure. In 1919, his brother William and his two children, Louis and Ila, arrived in town, but they decided to settle in an area northwest of Tucson called Postvale, Arizona.

In 1920, the longtime widower William Anway married Orpha Ralston. She had been a member for many years of the Postvale Co-operative Women&#x27;s Club. This group lobbied to have the local post office renamed from Postvale to Marana; in time, the town was also named Marana.

Marana did not become developed primarily as an agricultural center until after World War I. It has produced the commodity crops cotton, wheat, barley, alfalfa, and pecans.

During World War II, the Army built facilities in Marana to support the military effort, including the Marana Airfield (1942–45, now the Pinal Airpark). It became the largest pilot-training center in the world, training some 10,000 flyers.

In the Cold War years, five Titan missile sites were constructed in the area as part of a complex of ballistic missile installations built around Tucson.

After the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954, farmers against integration forced Black farmers out of Marana into nearby Rillito, Arizona.

In March 1977, the Town incorporated about and in August of that year, the 1,500 residents elected their first town council. In early 1979, the town began to grow through a targeted annexation policy. It now measures a little more than .

===Annexation===
The southern portion of Marana has grown considerably since the early 1990s, with the addition of businesses and some housing. This is largely due to the annexation of existing unincorporated areas. In 1992, the Marana Town Council voted to annex an area of unincorporated Pima County that was located southeast of the town limits. The area selected was a narrow corridor of land along Interstate 10, to the east along Ina Road, and south along Thornydale Road. These areas were mainly developed as high-density commercial businesses and shopping centers, including large retailers or &quot;big box&quot; stores. Marana chose these areas to annex to increase its revenue from sales taxes. The large residential areas behind these commercial areas, which required support for residents, such as schools and roads, were not annexed.

As a result, the city of Tucson filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of Arizona in and for the County of Pima (&quot;City of Tucson v Town of Marana&quot;), claiming that Marana illegally annexed the unincorporated areas in violation of existing state laws. However, on April 4, 1994, Judge Lina Rodriguez ruled in favor of Marana, allowing the annexation to stand. Following this suit, the Arizona State annexation laws were changed, forbidding municipalities from annexing small strips of land without taking large surrounding parcels as well. Such &quot;strip annexation&quot; is no longer allowed under Arizona law.

Temperatures below the freezing mark are not uncommon during this period. In the summer, high temperatures range between , with nights cooling down to around . The occasional heat wave can cause temperatures to soar above for multiple days during the hot summer months. Rain is much more frequent during the summer due to the North American Monsoon, and is sometimes accompanied by high winds and thunderstorms. Due to its lower elevation and less pronounced urban heat island effect, Marana generally sees slightly warmer daytime temperatures and cooler nighttime temperatures than Tucson.

==Town facts==

* Marana was named for the Spanish word &quot;maraña&quot; (&quot;thicket&quot;) by 19th-century railroad workers who had to clear a line through the area.
* In 2007, Marana began hosting the PGA Tour&#x27;s WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship (now the WGC-Cadillac Match Play Championship). Held in late February, the event included the world&#x27;s top 64 professional golfers. Henrik Stenson won the inaugural event, and Tiger Woods won in 2008. Geoff Ogilvy won the 2009 event. Ian Poulter won the 2010 event and Luke Donald took the 2011 title. The tournament remained in Marana through 2014. (In September 2014, Cadillac was announced as the new title sponsor for 2015, and the event was moved to San Francisco&#x27;s TPC Harding Park golf course.)
* Pinal Airpark (Evergreen International Aviation) is located just north of Marana in Pinal County. Many commercial airlines send their airplanes to this site for storage. It was well known in the 1970s and 1980s as an air base for the CIA. The airport was said to be a U.S. Forest Service air tanker base, but when a series of forest fires broke out in the mountains surrounding Tucson in the early 1970s, Airpark officials had to admit that these places were not Forest Service tankers. Locals had asked for them to put out the fires. Airpark officials said these were actually paramilitary cargo planes. Access to the Airpark is stringently monitored.

<text>Oro Valley, incorporated in 1974, is a suburban town located north of Tucson, Arizona, United States, in Pima County. According to the 2020 census, the population of the town is 47,070, an increase from 29,700 in 2000. Dubbed the &quot;Upscale Tech Mecca&quot; of Southern Arizona by the &quot;Arizona Daily Star&quot; newspaper, Oro Valley is home to over 10 high tech firms and has a median household income nearly 50% higher than the U.S. median. The town is located approximately southeast of the state capital of Phoenix.

Oro Valley is situated in the western foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains at the base of Pusch Ridge. The Tortolita Mountains are located north of the town, and vistas of the Tucson valley are to the south. The town occupies the middle Cañada del Oro Valley. Oro Valley hosts a large number of residents from around the US who maintain second or winter homes in the town.

The town hosted the 2006 Pac-10 Women&#x27;s Golf Championships at the Oro Valley Country Club. Oro Valley Country Club was also the site for the 2006 Girls&#x27; Junior America&#x27;s Cup, a major amateur golf tournament for the Western United States. Annual events in Oro Valley include the Oro Valley Festival of the Arts, El Tour de Tucson bicycle race, the Oro Valley Music Festival, the Tucson Marathon, the Cactus Speed Classic for inline skaters, the Oro Valley Triathlon, and the Arizona Distance Classic.

==History==

===Pre-U.S. annexation period===
The area of Oro Valley has been inhabited discontinuously for nearly two thousand years by various groups of people. The Native American Hohokam tribe lived in the Honeybee Village in the foothills of the Tortolita Mountains on Oro Valley&#x27;s far north side around 450 A.D. Hohokam artifacts continue to be discovered in the Honeybee Village that the Hohokam inhabited continuously for nearly 800 years, and studied by archaeologists around the globe.

Early in the 16th century, Native American tribes known as the Apache arrived in the southern Arizona area, including Oro Valley. These tribes inhabited the region only a few decades prior to the arrival of the Spanish Conquistadors, including Francisco Coronado. The Spanish established forts in the area, including the Presidio at Tucson (1775) beginning in the late 16th century.

===Arizona Territorial period===
Beginning in the 19th century, Americans increasingly settled in the Arizona Territory, following the Mexican–American War and the subsequent Gadsden Purchase including Southern Arizona. Following the Civil War and several Army efforts to pacify the Apaches, Tucson settlers ventured north to settle Oro Valley. Francisco Romero, from a Hispanic family tracing its Tucson roots to the early nineteenth century, established a ranch in what is Catalina State Park today by 1869. He constructed ranch buildings on the foundations of the Hohokam ruins in the park. Romero lived there intermittently from 1869 to his death in 1905. Members of the Romero family occupied land in that same area until 1930.

George Pusch, a German immigrant, occupied land in the area of Oro Valley after 1874, establishing a cattle ranch. This ranch was unique because it utilized a steam pump to provide water, eventually popularizing Pusch&#x27;s property as the Steam Pump Ranch on the Cañada del Oro. The steam pump was one of only two in the Arizona Territory. Pusch and his family never lived on the ranch. They visited frequently and employed caretakers to manage the property. George Pusch, and later the Pusch Land and Cattle Company, owned Steam Pump Ranch until 1925. Pusch&#x27;s ranch provided respite for settlers and travelers entering and leaving the Tucson area. Pusch Ridge is named in honor of George Pusch.

Ranching continued to flourish in the area as greater numbers of Americans settled in the Arizona Territory and the state of Arizona. Federal homesteads became available after 1903 when surveys of land were completed. Homesteads were claimed by individuals from 1903 until the 1940s. Hispanic homesteaders included Francisco Romero, Jesus Elias, Francisco Marin, Francisco Aragon and others. Female homesteaders included Ina Gittings, Mabel Burke Johnson, Margaret Moodie and others. Other prominent homesteaders included William Sutherland, James Reidy and David Morgan.

Large ranching families came to the Oro Valley area in the period 1930–1960. Many of these were wealthy individuals from the Midwest and the East. They vacationed in Tucson during the period and became interested in living in the desert. They purchased many of the homesteads occupied by original settlers who sold out after 1930. These wealthy ranchers obtained properties of 1000 to 7000 acres. They usually lived on the ranches in the winter months and employed caretakers to manage the property and cattle. These wealthy ranchers included Walter McDonald, John Procter, Lawrence Rooney, Joseph McAdams and Lloyd and Betty Golder.

Gold rushers into the American West also were attracted to southern Arizona, where gold was said to be in abundance in and around the Santa Catalina Mountains north of Tucson. Fueled by the legend of the lost Iron Door Gold Mine in the mountains, those in search of gold trekked through the Oro Valley area focusing their attention along the Cañada del Oro washbed. No significant amounts of gold were found locally.

===Post-World War II period===
After World War II, the Tucson area experienced dramatic population growth, impacting Oro Valley as well. Property owners began subdividing local real estate for development in the early 1930s. Construction of Campo Bello, the first suburban development, began in 1948. Lots in the Linda Vista Citrus Tracts were sold from the late 1930s to the 1960s and occupied by residents. In the early 1950s the Oro Valley Country Club opened at the base of Pusch Ridge, affirming the area&#x27;s future as an affluent community. The Suffolk Hills development was constructed in the period 1960–1962. Although one tract housing development was built in the area in the early 1950s, the majority of homes in the Oro Valley area were built by individual land owners on large lots in a low density residential style.

===Founding of the town===
The community continued to grow gradually, and area residents increasingly desired local control of the land in the area. In the late 1960s, incorporation became a greater focus in Oro Valley. Tucson mayor James M. Corbett, Jr. expressed great interest in expanding the Tucson city limits to the far north side of Pima County. Corbett vowed to bring the Oro Valley area into Tucson &quot;kicking and screaming,&quot; alluding to the reservations Oro Valley residents expressed in joining Tucson.

A petition to incorporate began circulation in Oro Valley in 1968. The Pima County Board of Supervisors officially refused to allow Oro Valley to incorporate, and litigation followed. Ultimately, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled in favor of incorporation, and in 1974 the Town of Oro Valley was incorporated with only . The original town limits included the Linda Vista Citrus Tracts, Campo Bello Estates, Shadow Mountain Estates, and Oro Valley Country Club Estates. Activity in Oro Valley centered primarily around the Oro Valley Country Club and Canyon del Oro High School. While originally referred to as &quot;Palo Verde&quot;, town founders proceeded with incorporation efforts with the official name of &quot;Oro Valley&quot; to garner support from influential residents of Oro Valley Country Club. The town began with a population of nearly 1,200.

Through the 1980s and particularly in the 1990s Oro Valley experienced significant residential and commercial growth. In 1990 the town had a population of 6,670, and by 2000 that figure had increased to 29,700 residents. During that time, residential communities of all housing-unit densities were developed in the town, including several master-planned communities. For several years in the 1990s Oro Valley was the fastest growing municipality in Arizona.

===Current state of the town===
Formed by citizens of Oro Valley, the not-for-profit Oro Valley Historical Society has a mission in &quot;preserving the Town&#x27;s heritage for future generations.&quot;

==Geography==

==Climate==
Oro Valley has very similar weather conditions to Tucson, due to their proximity to one another; however, there are small differences. Oro Valley sees slightly less rain throughout the year due to being west of the Santa Catalina Mountains and most of Tucson being to the south or southwest of the mountains. The general temperature of Oro Valley is slightly cooler than Tucson year round due to the higher elevation. Wind tends to flow in a north, northwesterly direction and the sun rises later than Tucson due to the Santa Catalina Mountains.

<text>Sahuarita is a town in Pima County, Arizona, United States. Sahuarita is located south of the Tohono O&#x27;odham Nation and abuts the north end of Green Valley, south of Tucson. The 2022 population estimate was 35,638.

==History==
Sahuarita was founded in 1911 and incorporated in 1994.

===Hohokam (200–1450)===
The first known human inhabitants of the Sahuarita region were the Hohokam people, which may be the ancestors of the modern day Tohono O&#x27;odham nation. The Hohokam were known for their highly innovative and extensive use of irrigation. The Hohokam were a very peaceful people, they had extensive trade routes extending to Mesoamerica, and showed many cultural influences from their southern neighbors.

===Sobaipuri (1400–1900)===
The Sobaipuri were possibly related to the Hohokam, and occupied the Southern portion of the Santa Cruz, with the Pima to their North and South. While Coronado passed just east of Sahuarita in 1521, it was not until Eusebio Kino&#x27;s 1691 journey along the Santa Cruz River that he met the leaders of the Sobaipuri people. Kino was a true champion of the indigenous Indians, opposing forced labor in mines by Spanish overseers. Kino would later go on to found the Mission San Xavier del Bac in 1699, just north of Sahuarita. In 1775, Francisco Garcés would follow the same path, laying the groundwork for the founding of Tucson.

===Spanish and Mexican control (1775–1853)===
In 1775, after building a series of missions in the region, the Spanish established a fort in the Tucson region to control the Native American settlements nearby. This just north of Sahuarita, which effectively placed the region under Spanish control. Eventually a town came to be and was named Tucson. After the Mexican War of Independence in 1821, the region came under Mexican control until they sold the land to the United States as part of the Gadsden Purchase.

===Incorporation into the U.S. (1854–1874)===
In 1854, following the Gadsden Purchase, Sahuarita would become a part of the Territory of New Mexico, in the United States of America. In the same year, Andrew B. Gray would travel the region on behalf of the Texas Western Railroad, in order to run a preliminary survey of the region. Meanwhile, the Native American peoples of the region were being pushed onto each other&#x27;s land through American expansionism. In 1857, the Sobaipuri, who had acted as a buffer between the hostile Mexicans to the south and Apache to the north, finally collapsed under the pressure and vacated the area, generally moving westward to Papago territory. Sahuarita was part of the Confederate Arizona Territory between 1861 and 1862 before being captured by the Union and incorporated into Arizona Territory in 1863. In 1867, Fort Crittenden was created between Sonoita and Patagonia in order to support the establishment of American settlements in the Santa Cruz Valley. In 1874, the San Xavier reservation was created, now called the Tohono O&#x27;odham Reservation, and Native Americans were forcibly relocated to the reservation.

===Sahuarita on the map (1870–1925)===

An 1870 map of Arizona shows an &quot;Indian Village&quot; just north of Sahuarita. The earliest known reference to the town can be found on a German map from 1875, which labels the town &quot;Sahuarito&quot;. The first known US map to list the town came in 1879, by the US Department of Interior, calling the town &quot;Saurita&quot;. The Saurita town name would continue to be found on successive maps of 1880 and 1890.
Finally, a 1925 map of &quot;Auto Trails&quot; (e.g. roadways) of Arizona and New Mexico lists &quot;Continental&quot; instead of Sahuarita. The roadway at the time was an &quot;improved road&quot;, one step inferior to a &quot;paved road&quot;, laying the route to what today is called the Old Nogales Highway.

===Sahuarita Ranch (1879–1886)===
In 1879 Sahuarita Ranch was created by James Kilroy Brown. Brown chose the name Sahuarita due to the preponderance of saguaros in the area. The ranch was used as a staging area between Tucson, Arivaca, and Quijotoa. A small community developed in the area named Sahuarito, while the railroad laid tracks through the area (which remain to this day) and established a station and post office. Although originally surveyed by the Texas Western Railroad, the route would soon be run by the Southern Pacific Railroad up until the late 20th century. Brown sold his ranch in 1886 which caused the region to stagnate for three decades.

During this time, the hub of Sahuarita commerce was at the intersection of Sahuarita Road and Nogales Highway, in the form of the One Stop Market and Sahuarita Bar and Grill. These 130-year-old buildings which remained intact were demolished for a road expansion in 2013.

===Continental Farm (1915–present)===

The Continental Farm of Sahuarita plays a central role in town history. In 1915, worried about the possibility of a German blockade of rubber imports, Bernard Baruch, Joseph Kennedy and J.P. Morgan founded the farm along the Santa Cruz River with hopes of growing guayule: plants that provide rubber. The project was abandoned after the end of World War I, and in 1922, was sold to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. The Queen rented the land to cotton farmers, in what would be the primary crop for the following four decades. In 1948, R. Keith Walden relocated the Farmers Investment Co. (FICO) from California to Arizona, buying the Continental Farm lands from the Queen. In 1965, over fears of a fall in demand for cotton resulting from the advent of synthetic fibers, Walden switched his crop to pecans. Today, the FICO pecan orchard is the largest in the world, with over and 106,000 trees.

===World War II (1941–1945)===
During World War II, Sahuarita was home to the Sahuarita Airstrip which was used to train bomber pilots for service in the war. Camp Continental, a labor camp for German prisoners of war was also located in Sahuarita. The location of the camp was around what is now Continental Ranch, West of the Nogales Highway and the Quail Crossing Boulevard intersection. It was established around November 1944, as one of 21 &quot;branch&quot; POW camps established throughout the state. The population of 250 prisoners primarily worked in agriculture, tending to cotton and vegetable crops. More than one escape attempt was made by the Germans, all of which failed.

===Sahuarita Bombing and Gunnery Range (1942–1978)===

The United States Army Air Corps, from Davis–Monthan Air Force Base, first used this range in April 1942 for practice bombing runs. The Sahuarita Flight Strip was completed in 1943, with a paved runway, and the bombing runs ceased shortly thereafter. The site included 12 buildings in addition to the airstrip, and four observational towers. In 1950, bomber crews operating out of Carswell AFB, Texas, restarted bombing runs on the range, which would last until 1962, with the airway strip remaining in use as an emergency landing strip thereafter. The Federal government soon released the land to the State of Arizona in 1978, who in turn leased the land to a cattle rancher. The former airstrip has been converted into a roadway that leads to &quot;Sahuarita Park&quot;, while the remaining land remains in use for cattle grazing.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is continuing its longstanding efforts of identifying remaining munitions, preventing environmental contamination, and protecting several endangered species in the area, including jaguars, spotted owls, among others. Several different types of expended ammunition rounds can be found throughout the range, most of which found are 10 to 20 mm anti-aircraft rounds. Shrapnel from the dropped ordnance also litters the range, as well as dozens of crushed olive drab ammunition boxes. Shell casings and magazine clips can also be found, along with JATO tanks and large cross targets, constructed of wood with orange reflectors for visibility from the air. The crosses were used as targets for the airmen in training. Many United States Tobacco Company tins have been found, discarded by the several different aviators who occupied the area during its military days. The actual airstrip is now used as a road leading to Sahuarita Park and the Edge Charter School, both of which were built among the remains of the older air force buildings.

===Cold War===
Sahuarita contains the Titan Missile Museum, built in 1963 during the height of the Cold War, which is the only Titan Missile site in the world accessible to the public. The actual Titan II missile, the most powerful nuclear missile on standby in the US, remains in the silo for visitors to see. The Sahuarita Airstrip continued to be used by the U.S. Air Force throughout most of the Cold War.

==Population==
The population of the town was 1,629 in the 1990 census, while at the 2000 census, the population rose to 3,242. By 2010, the population rose to 25,259. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that it had a population of 26,870 in 2013.

==Geography==
Sahuarita is located at (31.929245, -110.982241). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land. Since the most recent census was taken in 2000, the town has annexed more land; its area is now approximately . The Santa Cruz River (Arizona) runs through the desert town, flowing north towards Tucson, mostly during the monsoons, or extended climatic wet periods. Late 19th century and early 20th century still contained beaver in the river from Tucson, southwards. Madera Canyon, located just southeast of the town, is another important landmark, day trip site, and a birdwatching point.

===Water sustainability===
In the desert southwest, water sustainability is a major concern. According to a 2007 report by Pima County, of water was pumped from the aquifer in the Upper Santa Cruz Valley in 2006 [in the report referred to as the Green Valley area, which includes Sahuarita], with 85 percent of that water being used for mining and agriculture. The remaining 15 percent was split between water used for golf courses and residential/commercial water use. The report explains that &quot;The Green Valley area does not have a sustainable water supply given current groundwater pumping rates... the water table in Green Valley has been declining in past years, and is expected to decline even faster as water demands [continue to increase]...&quot;. The report concludes that &quot;Water supplies will become critical within the next ten years.&quot;

The Upper Santa Cruz Valley has several &quot;major water users&quot;, all pumping water out of the same aquifer. None of these are owned by Pima County, the town of Sahuarita, nor Green Valley. The major water users are all private companies: ASARCO-Mission Mine, Phelps Dodge Sierrita Mine; Farmers Water Company; Sahuarita Water Company, Las Quintas Serenas Water Company, Quail Creek Water Company, Community Water Company of Green Valley, and the Green Valley Water District. The proliferation of water companies can be partially explained by the fact that the actual water in the aquifer is not owned by anyone, thus any amount of water can be pumped out, with costs limited only to drilling, pumping, distribution, etc.

===Sahuarita Lake===
Sahuarita Lake is an artificial lake that was completed on June 22, 2001, by Rancho Sahuarita. The lake surface area is , with a long perimeter and maximum depth of , holding approximately of water. This reflects a water amount equivalent to less than one tenth of one percent (&lt;0.1%) of the of water used by all of Sahuarita and Green Valley in 2006.

The lake is a &quot;managed lake&quot;, which means that natural ecological changes within the lake that do &quot;not fit within the parameters set by man&quot;, are cause for remedial action to return to the goals of the management plan. Air compressors located at various points under the lake continually inject air through diffusers which aids the movement of water in a process called vertical mixing. This system of continual aeration enables the circulation of all water in the lake on a daily basis, and therefore creates an ecological balance and uniform appearance. The lake also contains fish and frogs, the former of which are regularly stocked by the Arizona State Department of Game and Fish, and is an attraction to ducks and various kinds of birds.

The lake consumes water to the extent that all the water in the lake must be replenished every year. Regarding water evaporation, lake documents state that according to the USDA Water Conservation Laboratory in Phoenix, the mean annual evaporation rate for Sahuarita is per year. This results in a mean water loss of per year. Regarding water loss due to seepage, initial estimates indicated an annual loss of of water, or 17% of total capacity per year. The J. Harlan Glenn Engineers that provided this estimate indicated that this equates to an &quot;extremely low seepage rate&quot;. On average, 65 gpm (gallons of water per minute) must be pumped into the lake to maintain its current level. A nearby well site that draws on the shared Upper Santa Cruz Valley aquifer is used to refill the lake. In 2006, of water was used for the entire Sahuarita lake park, which includes water for the of grass and restroom facilities.

===2007 workforce survey===
In April 2007, the Eller College of Management conducted an assessment survey of Sahuarita residents due to the town&#x27;s 529% growth since the 2000 Census, because data from that census &quot;on workforce and community characteristics is no longer applicable.&quot; The survey was mailed to 7,805 households and was weighted by area to ensure a representative sampling.

The survey reported that in educational attainment 19.7% of residents are high school graduates; 32.4% have an associate degree or some college; 26.9% have a bachelor&#x27;s degree, and 14.6% have a master&#x27;s degree, and 3.3% have a Doctoral degree. These statistics lead to the finding that &quot;demonstrates significantly higher concentrations in associate’s, bachelor’s and graduate/professional degrees than the county as a whole, or the state.&quot;

For places of work, 57% of residents reported working in Tucson, with 16.6% working in Sahuarita, and 12.7% in Green Valley. It found that local workers specialized more than workers elsewhere in Pima County, being most concentrated in the following occupations:

==History==

In 1936, Tucson officials took steps to expand Tucson&#x27;s boundaries by moving to annex the unincorporated area along south Sixth Avenue from 25th Street south to the Veterans Hospital, which was south of Tucson city limits. Area auto court and other property owners on south Sixth Avenue objected, as they did not want to pay the higher business taxes imposed by Tucson or be subject to Tucson&#x27;s building codes. As a recourse to prevent the annexation, south Sixth Avenue property owners submitted a petition to the Pima County Board of Supervisors asking for an incorporation election. On August 10, 1936, South Tucson residents voted 52 to 35 in favor of incorporation. In response, Tucson continued to require Tucson Water customers in South Tucson to obtain building permits from Tucson, or their water would be shut off. The South Tucson City Council responded by imposing a $500 annual franchise fee on Tucson Water, and the Tucson City Council retaliated by announcing that water service would be discontinued to South Tucson within 120 days. On January 18, 1938, 258 petition signatures from South Tucson residents were turned in to the Pima County Board of Supervisors, which dissolved South Tucson. Nonetheless, another incorporation drive was launched in South Tucson. On March 27, 1939, a second incorporation election was held and by a vote of 70 to 63, South Tucson was reincorporated.

In 1956, Tucson Mayor Hummel called for South Tucson to join Tucson. After that invitation went unanswered, the Tucson City Council held a surprise meeting and annexed land all around South Tucson. Later, in the 1990s, Tucson agreed to transfer to South Tucson a 25-acre slice of land between South Tucson and Interstate 10 as South Tucson reached its current city size.

==Culture==
South Tucson has many Mexican restaurants, colorful buildings and outdoor murals. The existing Mexican food restaurants on South Fourth Avenue have long been a draw. Some of the long-established eateries dotting South Fourth Avenue in South Tucson have grabbed national headlines, perhaps none more famously than Mi Nidito, where President Bill Clinton had lunch in 1999 and where &quot;the President&#x27;s Plate&quot; is still on the menu.

The 1.2-square-mile city is gaining favor with businesses and residents and is attracting bohemians, artists, and musicians. The city is trying to attract more business through a new economic development plan and an incentive program. Local business owners and developers are eyeing properties in South Tucson as complementary projects to downtown Tucson with business parks, restaurants, retail shops, and multifamily investors moving into the city.

==Crime==
South Tucson has also been fighting a long, uphill battle with crime rates. For larceny, theft and aggravated assault, South Tucson ranks at about four times the national average.

However, there have been sizable advances in repressing criminal activity, due to use of &quot;wolf pack&quot; saturation tactics by the South Tucson Police Department in conjunction with the Arizona Department of Public Safety. Vigorous enforcement of liquor license laws has reduced the number of alcohol-related crimes. Neighborhood activism has considerably reduced the amount of open drug activity and a rising level of education of youth is making a slow impact on gang related activity.

==Education==
It is in the Tucson Unified School District.

South Tucson residents attend Ochoa Community Magnet, Mission View Elementary, Holladay Magnet Elementary, Elizabeth Borton Magnet, Madge Utterback Magnet Middle, Safford K-8 Magnet Baccalaureate World, Tucson High Magnet, &amp; Pueblo Magnet High Schools, all part of Tucson USD.

==Governmental representation==
South Tucson is in Arizona&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, represented by Representative Raúl Grijalva, a Democrat.

In November 2024, Roxanna Valenzuela assumed the role of Mayor. Her priorities include strengthening the local police and fire departments, strengthening small businesses, protecting the unique culture of South Tucson, addressing the widespread challenges of homelessness and substance addiction, and building more affordable housing.

<text>Tanque Verde is a suburban unincorporated community in Pima County, Arizona, United States, northeast of Tucson. The population was 16,195 at the 2000 census. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Tanque Verde as a census-designated place (CDP).

== History ==

Tanque Verde began as a small community, remote from Tucson, and settled by ranchers arriving to the American West around the 1860s. The name of the area, which means &quot;green tank,&quot; is a reference to the algae in a large and prominent stock water tank in the area in the late 19th century.

The Tanque Verde Valley was used by the Apache, a Native American tribe throughout the 19th century. Soldiers from Fort Lowell operated by the U.S. Army in the late 19th century also frequented the Tanque Verde Valley.

In 1886, the residents of the Tanque Verde valley established the Tanque Verde School District as the first significant political entity of the community.

The army closed Fort Lowell in 1891, and when some Hispanic immigrants from Baja California and Sonora saw the fort&#x27;s buildings standing empty, they moved into the abandoned adobes. Soon they began farming the rich floodplain northeast of the fort, where Pantano Wash feeds into Tanque Verde Creek to form the Rillito (Little River), and by the turn of the century the community they came to call El Fuerte was thriving. Upstream from El Fuerte, in the canyons and nooks (rincons) of the front range of the Santa Catalina Mountains and the Rincon range—the area they came to call Tanque Verde—Hispanic families with names like Escalante, Estrada, Andrade, Vindiola, Lopez, Riesgo, Benitez, Telles, Martinez, and Gallegos began establishing homes and ranches. Initially the largely self-sufficient community of homesteads thrived, but over time many of the smaller ranches were swallowed up by larger ones or sold to speculators. According to Frank Escalante, a descendant of Tanque Verde homesteaders, some non-Hispanic Americans robbed some of these families of their land titles and ranches by fraud or force. Some Hispanics who became Mexican Americans after the Gadsden Purchase had limited understanding of English and a naivete regarding American property law even four decades after the transition, and made easy marks for the unscrupulous. The infamous Arizona Rangers sometimes enforced interlopers&#x27; property claims. The First World War brought a rise in the market for cotton and the value of farmland, and still more of the original homesteaders felt pressured to sell. Ultimately the growth of Tucson and the demand for land for housing priced most of the remaining pioneers off their ranches.

In 1989, Tanque Verde was the main site for the Nickelodeon program &quot;Hey Dude&quot;.

By 2005, more than 1,600 students were enrolled in the school district&#x27;s three schools, serving grades K–9. The Tanque Verde School District continues to register among the highest standardized test scores in Arizona.

As the Tucson area increased population, the Tanque Verde Valley did as well, but at a much slower rate. Much of the land in Tanque Verde is in covenants dictating land-use policies. These covenants strongly control growth and are considered by residents to ensure land preservation. By the 1960s, Tanque Verde had become a true suburb of Tucson.

Tanque Verde has become a community, with a significant equestrian presence.

==Geography==
The Tanque Verde Valley is characterized by the Santa Catalina Mountains to the north, and the Rincon Mountains to the east. The Tanque Verde Valley is traversed by two notable seasonal creeks, Tanque Verde and Agua Caliente.

<text>Three Points is a census-designated place (CDP) in Pima County, Arizona, United States. The population was 5,581 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Three Points, also known as Robles Junction was founded in 1882. Bernabe S. Robles, who was born in 1857, in Baviácora, Sonora, Mexico. His family relocated to Tucson in 1864, where he grew up. After spending sometime in Florence, Arizona, he returned to Tucson and accepted a mail route to Gunsight, Arizona, near Ajo. It was during this time he located what is now called Robles Pass, near Cat (Back) Mountain, while searching for a shorter route to Gunsight. In 1882, he had his brother Jesús homesteaded 160 acres at what is now Robles Junction/Three Points. The brothers dug a well to set up a watering stop and stage station so Bernabe could water his horses along his mail route. He eventually gave up his mail route, and moved to the former watering stop/stage station, which at that point was called the Robles Ranch. He and his family ran the ranch for many years, even after the family had moved back to Tucson. Robles died in 1945. The old ranch house is now the Three Points/Robles Junction Community Center.

<text>Arizona City is an unincorporated census-designated place (CDP) in southwestern Pinal County, Arizona, United States. It is located near the junction of Interstate 8 and Interstate 10 at the midpoint between Phoenix and Tucson, approximately from the downtown of both cities. The population was 10,475 as of the 2010 U.S. Census. It is estimated to be approximately 11,030 as of a 2017 U.S. Census estimate. Arizona City is a rural, primarily residential community that features a 48-acre (19 ha) man-made lake These attributes make the community a popular snowbird destination, with the population increasing by as much as 5,000 people in the winter months to reach the census figure of 11,030. Most recently after the last Census, many full-time residents have relocated to the unincorporate town.

==History==
The area around what is now known as Arizona City was used as a resting area for Juan Bautista de Anza&#x27;s expedition party after they emerged from Apache land in 1775. The area is considered an official part of the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail. This historic trail begins in Sonora, Mexico, and ends at the Presidio in San Francisco, California.

The unincorporated census-designated place was founded in 1959 when Jack McRae, president of the Arizona City Development Corporation, purchased and developed of land in the Santa Cruz Valley in the area that would eventually grow to become the 6.2 square-mile modern day townsite. The location was selected because of the abundance of deep water from the Santa Cruz River found in the valley. At the time, the water was considered some of the purest in Arizona; every 14 days samples were sent to the state Health Department and would come back consistently rated 100% pure. As the community grew, a Contracted United States Post Office with Free E-P.O Box was established on April 1, 1962, and Arizona City began appearing on Rand McNally road atlases in 1963. It is uncertain how the name of the community was chosen. Many attempts have been made to establish another form of mail delivery and do away with the outdated method of Free E-P.O Box, last vote being held several years ago (which had originally passed) but a re-vote was conducted in winter when part-time residence (winter visitors) returned and it was rejected. Many new full-time families have located in recent years (approximately 2018-2023) and the current method is inadequate. It has negatively affected residents for decades. USPS does not deliver to homes and is a contracted office that holds the bid. Petitions have been established on change.org to establish curbside mail delivery as surrounding areas receive. Many residents are unhappy with the current method.

From time to time, most recently in 2007, attempts have been made to incorporate as a municipality, but they have so far always been defeated at the ballot box, except for the first effort in the early 1980s, which succeeded at the ballot box but was overturned in court because there were not enough residents at that time to incorporate.

The area in and around Arizona City contained several of the 272 concrete Corona Satellite Calibration Targets, which were used to calibrate cameras on the satellites in the Corona Satellite Program that lasted from 1959 to 1972. These satellites were used for espionage on the Soviet Union (USSR) and China during the Cold War. Many of these have since been removed, but one still exists at the corner of West Alsdorf Road and South Sunland Gin Road in the center of the community.

==Geography==

Arizona City is located at (32.751641, −111.679283). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and (1.29%) is water.

The CDP is approximately above sea level and located in an area of Pinal County known as the Santa Cruz Flats. According to the Arizona Geological Survey, the valley floor surrounding Arizona City and nearby Eloy has lowered by more than in the past 50 years due to rapid depletion of the groundwater aquifers underneath the region. In 2017, a new earth fissure approximately long and wide opened up just south of Arizona City, another consequence caused by the rapid consumption of groundwater.

Arizona City itself is mostly flat, lying in the Santa Cruz Valley in the center of three low mountain ranges; the Sawtooth Mountains to the south, the Picacho Mountains to the east, and the Casa Grande Mountains to the north. Picacho Peak, a prominent peak with a summit elevation of , is located approximately to the southeast adjacent to Interstate 10. Directly to the west of the CDP is the expansive Tohono O&#x27;odham Indian Reservation, which stretches south to the international border with Mexico.

==Climate==

Arizona City has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh), normal for the Sonoran Desert. The community experiences long, extremely hot summers and mild winters. The area averages only of annual rainfall. Winter months are defined by frequent sunshine and consist of mild daytime highs between . At nighttime, the temperature drops rapidly, with lows averaging between . Nighttime lows at or below the freezing mark are not uncommon. During the winter, an occasional cold front will pass through the area sometimes containing a brief shower. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Arizona City was . During the entirety of the summer and the second half of May, high temperatures are usually between , with the occasional heat wave spiking daytime high temperatures above . The highest temperature ever recorded in Arizona City was .

Along with the rest of Arizona, the community is affected by the North American Monsoon during summer, which brings high winds and occasional heavy rain. A large portion of the community is located in Pinal County&#x27;s floodplain, and is very susceptible to flash flooding during heavy monsoon rains. Due to extensive farmland in the valley, the area is also very prone to dust storms, which can occur any month of the year during windy conditions.

==Demographics==
Arizona City first appeared on the 1990 U.S. Census as a census-designated place (CDP).

The 2010 Census determined that Arizona City had a population of 10,475, a 126% increase from the 2000 Census figure of 4,385. The racial and ethnic composition of the population was 50.3% non-Hispanic white, 2.1% black or African American, 5.3% Native American, 0.3% Asian American, 0.0% Pacific Islander, and 40.9% Hispanic. Population density was 1,713.6 people per square mile. There were 4,296 housing units, with an average of 2.56 persons per household. 62.3% of households were owner-occupied, and the median value of these housing units was $99,300. The median gross rent in Arizona City was $844 per month.

7.5% of the population was under 5 years of age, 26.5% of the population was between the ages of 5 and 18, and 18.8% of the population was 65 or older. 7.4% of the Arizona City&#x27;s population was born in a country other than the United States.

Only 13.4% of the population in Arizona City has a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher, although 83.4% of the population has at least a high school diploma. The mean travel time to work was 27.7 minutes, and the median household income was $42,853, with 20.4% of the population living below the poverty line.

==Economy==

Historically, Arizona City&#x27;s only employers have been the farms that surround the area and the few service jobs that exist within the townsite. However, being located in the middle of the Arizona Sun Corridor region, Arizona City&#x27;s economy may soon be impacted by several large proposed attractions and factories that will potentially add 30,000 new jobs and attract up to 4 million visitors annually.

One of these developments is the Dreamport Villages project, which is a $4 billion destination resort that will be located north of Arizona City. This project will contain an extreme sports venue, water parks, restaurants, retail space, a residential area, and a fully themed amusement park comparable to Walt Disney World. Another approved project is the Attesa Motorsports Park, which will be a 2,360-acre (955 ha) motorsports complex featuring two road courses, a driver experience center, and an event center. This project alone is expected to create more than 10,000 permanent jobs and will be located to the northwest of Arizona City, adjacent to Interstate 8.

Phoenixmart was promised to boost the economy, the project never came to fruition and the site is just an empty building. Lucid Motors, a Silicon Valley electric car company startup, has confirmed that it will build a $700 million electric car manufacturing plant in the nearby city of Casa Grande that will employ 2,000 workers by 2022.

Services in the area are very limited and travel outside of area is required for basic necessities (30 minutes - 1 Hour) to surrounding cities. USPS in the area is a contracted post office which offers free e PO box to residents since they do not service the area (curbside delivery or home delivery) as surrounding areas do. Petitions have been established to change the current inefficient and inadequate method.

<doc id="106738" wikidata="Q717903" url="?curid=106738" title="Aryan Brotherhood">
<text>The Aryan Brotherhood (AB or The Brand) is a neo-Nazi prison gang and an organized crime syndicate that is based in the United States and has an estimated 15,000–20,000 members both inside and outside prisons. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has characterized it as &quot;the nation&#x27;s oldest major white supremacist prison gang and a national crime syndicate&quot; while the Anti-Defamation League calls it the &quot;oldest and most notorious racist prison gang in the United States&quot;. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Aryan Brotherhood makes up an extremely low percentage of the entire US prison population, but it is responsible for a disproportionately large number of prison murders.

The gang has focused on the economic activities which organized crime entities typically engage in, particularly drug trafficking, extortion, inmate prostitution, and murder-for-hire. The organization of its whites-only membership varies from prison to prison but it is generally hierarchical, headed by a twelve-man council which is topped by a three-man commission. The Aryan Brotherhood uses various terms, symbols, and images in order to identify itself, including shamrocks, swastikas, and other symbols. In order to join the Aryan Brotherhood, new members may swear a blood oath or take a pledge; acceptance into the Aryan Brotherhood is aided by a prospect&#x27;s willingness to kill another inmate.

==History==

Most prisons in the United States were racially segregated until the 1960s. As prisons began to desegregate, many inmates organized themselves into gangs along racial lines. The Aryan Brotherhood is believed to have been formed at San Quentin State Prison, but it may have been inspired by the Bluebird Gang. They decided to strike against the African-Americans who were forming their own militant group called the Black Guerrilla Family. In the early 1970s, the Aryan Brotherhood had a connection with Charles Manson and the Manson Family. Several members of the Manson Family were in prison at the time, and they attempted to join forces. However, the relationship did not last long as the Aryan Brotherhood took offense at the murder of pregnant actress Sharon Tate.

The Aryan Brotherhood grew quickly in the California prison system and eventually started a race war in 1975 with the other prison gangs such as La Nuestra Familia, and Black Guerilla Family. As a result of the race war, California prison officials segregated the gangs to different prisons in California. When the Aryan Brotherhood was isolated in the Chino prison, they were able to continue to grow and develop their leadership hierarchy.

In 1981, Thomas Silverstein and Clayton Fountain were charged with the murder of a black inmate named Robert Chappelle in the United States Penitentiary, Marion, control unit. It was believed that Silverstein and Fountain strangled Chappelle in his cell. Silverstein and Fountain later killed Raymond Smith, a friend of Robert Chappelle. The two men stabbed Smith 67 times. Silverstein then started to plan killing a correctional officer. On October 22, 1983, gang members from the Aryan Brotherhood killed two correction officers at Marion. Silverstein killed an officer named Merle Clutts, stabbing him approximately 40 times. Several hours later, Fountain also killed an officer named Robert Hoffman. The tactics used were developed for a prior inmate murder; Silverstein used an improvised knife and handcuff key while being taken to the showers. He picked the lock, then attacked and killed Merle Clutts. Fountain used similar tactics to kill Robert Hoffman.

By the 1990s, the Aryan Brotherhood had shifted its focus away from killing for strictly racial reasons and focused on organized crime such as drug trafficking, prostitution, and sanctioned murders. They took on organized crime-level power inside much of the United States&#x27; prison system, where they eventually accumulated greater power and influence than the American Mafia. This situation was personified when, after being assaulted by an African-American inmate while incarcerated in Marion Federal Penitentiary in 1996, Gambino crime family boss John Gotti allegedly asked the Aryan Brotherhood to murder his attacker. Gotti&#x27;s attacker was immediately transferred to protective custody and the planned retaliation was abandoned.

In April 1993, members of the Aryan Brotherhood along with members of the Black Muslims and other gangs in the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility initiated the Lucasville Prison Riot in Lucasville. The rioters took several officers hostage and killed nine inmates, then killed an officer. Their complaints included alleged abusive treatment and overcrowding, with Black Muslims also demanding an end to mandatory tuberculosis testing, which they said violated their faith.

=== Investigations and prosecutions ===

In late 2002, 29 leaders of the gang were simultaneously rounded up from prisons all over the country and brought to trial under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. The intention was to bring death sentences for at least 21 of them, in a manner similar to tactics used against organized crime. The case produced 30 convictions but none of the most powerful leaders received a death sentence. Sentencing occurred in March 2006 for three of the most powerful leaders of the gang, including Barry Mills and Tyler Bingham, who were indicted for numerous crimes, including murder, conspiracy, drug trafficking, and racketeering and for ordering killings and beatings from their cells. Bingham and Mills were convicted of murder and sent back to United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility Prison (ADX) in Florence, Colorado, escaping the death penalty. Bingham is serving a life sentence without parole. Mills, also sentenced to life without parole, died in ADX in 2018.

Prosecuting the gang has been difficult, because many members are already serving life sentences with no possibility of parole, so prosecutors were seeking the death penalty for 21 of those indicted but have dropped the death penalty on all but five defendants. By September 2006, the 19 indictees not eligible for the death penalty had pleaded guilty. The first of a series of trials involving four high level members ended in convictions in July 2006.

On June 23, 2005, after a 20-month investigation, a federal strike force raided six houses in northeastern Ohio which belonged to members of the &quot;Order of the Blood&quot;, a criminal organization which is controlled by the Aryan Brotherhood. 34 Aryan Brotherhood members or associates were arrested and warrants were issued for the arrests of ten more.

In June 2019, 16 members and associates of the Aryan Brotherhood were charged with numerous federal offenses following a multiyear investigation inside and outside of California’s prisons. Members and associates of the gang were charged with racketeering, murder, attempted murder and drug trafficking crimes. In April 2024, a federal jury found California State Prison Sacramento inmate Ronald &quot;Renegade&quot; Yandell, 61, guilty of murder in aid of racketeering; conspiracy to conduct the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity; five counts of conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering; two counts of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine and heroin; five counts of distribution of heroin; and one count of distribution of methamphetamine. The same jury found inmate Danny Troxell, 71, guilty of conspiracy to conduct the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity and conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering. The jury found inmate Billy Sylvester, 55, guilty of murder in aid of racketeering; conspiracy to conduct the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity; conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine and heroin; and distribution of methamphetamine. The three are already serving life sentences and await punishment for the most recent verdicts.

A 34-year-year old man associated with the &quot;Aryan Cowboy Brotherhood&quot; was identified as the key suspect known as &quot;Umbrella Man&quot; who allegedly incited the looting and burning of the first building in the aftermath of the June 2020 George Floyd Protests in Minneapolis. As of late 2022, he has not been charged with any crime.

In November 2020, more than sixty individuals that were associated with the Aryan Brotherhood were arrested in a multi-agency operation that took place in California, Montana, and Nevada. Investigators saw evidence that Aryan Brotherhood members were operating outside of prisons and noticed connections between the gang and violent crimes, firearms trafficking, and drug trafficking. The government saw these offenses occurring on the West Coast, however, connections to the gang were made across the country, reaching as far as Alabama, all tied to the Aryan Brotherhood, eventually leading to the seizure of 80 pounds of methamphetamine, 5 pounds of heroin, and more than 25 firearms.
== Ideology and motivation ==

The initial motivation for the formation of the group in San Quentin in 1964 was self-protection against an existing black prison gang. The SPLC has said that, although they clearly have a white supremacist ideology, the major motivation is money, and they have occasionally set aside racist views, such as by allying themselves with Latin American gangs, in order to make a profit.

The SPLC, which monitors hate groups and other extremists throughout the United States, has designated the Aryan Brotherhood as &quot;...the nation&#x27;s oldest major white supremacist prison gang and a national crime syndicate&quot;, and the &quot;...largest and deadliest prison gang in the United States&quot;.

Daryl Johnson, leader of the Domestic Terrorist Analysis Team whose job it is to monitor the activity of right-wing militias and other domestic terrorist groups, said that white supremacist organizations in prisons are a &quot;...radicalization threat&quot;, committing acts of violence inside prison, and then in the larger communities after release. Johnson named the Aryan Brotherhood, Aryan Brotherhood of Texas, and the Aryan Circle as examples of white supremacist prison-based gangs which are radicalization threats.

In an investigation in California prisons which ended in 1989, the FBI characterized the Brotherhood as a &quot;...violent, white supremacist group&quot;, and a 2008 DHS intelligence conference in Newport, Rhode Island divided violent domestic extremism into three types, and concluded that white supremacist groups like Aryan Brotherhood remained a threat and a cause for concern.

== Operations and membership ==

Estimates of Aryan Brotherhood membership vary from 15,000 to 20,000 members in and out of prison.

The Aryan Brotherhood has members inside federal and state prisons, and outside on the streets. All members are white, and are either in prison or have been in prison. Joining is difficult. New members are on probation for a year, must swear a blood oath for life, and must commit a violent act to join the Brotherhood, such as killing a rival inmate, assaulting an officer or murdering an African American or Hispanic prisoner. Members are inculcated with various reading materials smuggled into prisons published by Aryan Nations, Militia of Montana, and other groups, as well as &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, &quot;The Art of War&quot;, and Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;The Prince&quot;. Early members liked the Western novels of Louis L&#x27;Amour, source of the organization&#x27;s self-proclaimed &quot;the Brand&quot; moniker. Therefore, they perpetuated an admiration for the outlaw gunslingers of the American West. Members also have a fondness for medieval Vikings and the pirates of the Golden Age.

Criminal activities inside prison walls include male prostitution, gambling, extortion, and drug trafficking, primarily involving methamphetamine. Outside prison, the AB engages in every kind of criminal enterprise, &quot;...including murder-for-hire, armed robbery, gun running, methamphetamine manufacturing, heroin sales, counterfeiting, and identity theft&quot;, according to the SPLC.

== Organization and affiliation ==

=== Organization ===

After its formation in California prisons in the mid-1960s, the Aryan Brotherhood had spread to most California prisons by 1975. After some of its leaders were sent to federal prisons, they took the opportunity to start organizing inside the federal prison system. This ended with the creation of two separate, but related organizations, the California Aryan Brotherhood, and the federal prison Aryan Brotherhood. As a former top leader said, &quot;They&#x27;re like two related but different crime families. They each have their [ruling] commission… but they&#x27;re allies.&quot; By the late 1970s, these gangs had fewer than 100 members, but their membership grew rapidly as they absorbed other racist and skinhead groups, and today these gangs are estimated to have over 20,000 members in both the federal and state prison systems.

In its early days, the group had a one-man, one-vote system, but this broke down as a result of the group&#x27;s rapid expansion, and it was replaced by the establishment of a hierarchical structure, headed by a 12-man council, and overseen by a three-member commission. The federal and state systems each had their own council and commission. Organization varies somewhat, from prison to prison. For example, in the Arizona prison system, members are known as &quot;kindred&quot; and organize into &quot;families&quot;. A &quot;council&quot; controls the families. Kindred may recruit other members, known as &quot;progeny&quot;, and serve as a mentor for the new recruits.

A sort of internal banking or accounting system was instituted, which allowed them to &quot;tax&quot; criminal activity on the streets, and collect 20% on the proceeds, money which is then laundered and controlled by the commission.

=== Affiliations, alliances and rivalries ===
The Aryan Brotherhood is affiliated with a network of smaller peckerwood gangs, such as the Nazi Lowriders and Public Enemy No. 1, and the national hate-based organization Aryan Nations. The group also has an alliance with the Mexican Mafia (&quot;La Eme&quot;), as the two are mutual enemies of Black Guerrilla Family. Other rival gangs include the Black P. Stones, Bloods, Crips, D.C. Blacks, and Nuestra Familia.

The Brotherhood has associated in criminal ventures with the Hells Angels. The gangs were also involved in a power struggle in the East Bay, which led to the killing of Hells Angels vice-president Michael O&#x27;Farrell on June 6, 1989.

In 1992, the gang established ties with American Mafia crime, via boss John Gotti, who was sentenced to prison and contacted the Aryan Brotherhood for protection while he was in prison. Gotti also organized a business partnership which operated on the outside between his group and the Brotherhood and as a result of this business partnership, the group&#x27;s power greatly expanded on the streets.

The Aryan Brotherhood&#x27;s communication and control has become so tight and efficient that they have been able to organize and direct major criminal enterprises on the outside, even from solitary confinement, much to the frustration of federal and state authorities.

== Symbology and identification ==

The Aryan Brotherhood uses various symbols and images to identify members, and the organization, and spoken or written mottos and oaths to secure them.

=== Tattoos and other marks ===
New members were branded with a tattoo, following the procedure in a prison novel popular among inmates. The image was either a green shamrock (also called, &quot;the rock&quot;), the letters &quot;AB&quot;, or the number &quot;666&quot;. &quot;The brand&quot; meant the inmate belonged to Aryan Brotherhood.

Like most prison gangs, Aryan Brotherhood members mark themselves with distinctive tattoos. Designs commonly include the words &quot;Aryan Brotherhood&quot;, &quot;AB&quot;, &quot;666&quot;, Nazi symbolism such as SS, sig runes, and swastikas, as well as shamrocks and Celtic iconography.

=== Mottos and pledges ===

Other means of identification of group membership were the &quot;blood in, blood out&quot; motto symbolizing life-long membership with no exit other than death, and &quot;the pledge&quot;, an eight-line oath that each new member had to swear.

== Categorization and analysis ==

According to the FBI, as of 1992, the gang made up less than 1.0% of the prison population but was responsible for between 1825% of murders in the federal prison system.

The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released the Domestic Extremism Lexicon report in 2009 that defines different classifications of extremists. On the last entry of the 11-page report, it broke down the &quot;white supremacist movement&quot; into six categories: Neo-nazi, Ku Klux Klan, Christian Identity, racist skinhead, Nordic mysticism, and Aryan prison gangs.

An analysis by &quot;Slate&quot; describes the Aryan prison gang classification as &quot;...further outside the white supremacy mainstream&quot;, and describes them as largely independent of other white supremacist groups, although the lines blurred as time went on. The report also refers to them as &quot;more flexible&quot; than other white supremacist groups since &quot;...their criminal goals usually take precedence over ideology.&quot;

<text>A nitrate vulnerable zone is a conservation designation of the Environment Agency for areas of land that drain into nitrate polluted waters, or waterways that could become polluted by nitrates due to environmental and health threats. A nitrate vulnerable zone can be designated as a response to an increase in nitrate leaching or increased use of nitrate fertilizers.

== Nitrate pollution ==

=== Sources of nitrate pollution ===
One of the primary causes of nitrate pollution is the use of nitrogen fertilizers and application of manure to agricultural fields, which stimulates crop production but also contributes to nutrient pollution due to nitrate leaches from soil during heavy precipitation events.

=== Environmental impacts ===
Nitrate runoff can lead to eutrophication of waterways, leading to excessive algal growth and oxygen depletion.

=== Health effects ===
High levels of nitrate in drinking water used to prepare infant formula can negatively affect infant health. With continued use of contaminated water, infants can develop Blue Baby Syndrome, which can be fatal.

== Regulations ==
Nitrate vulnerable zones are designated when the concentration of nitrate in a given area reaches or surpasses 50 NO3− mg/L. Regulations include:

* Reducing the amount of fertilizer applied;
* Prohibiting application of fertilizer during the winter when runoff is greatest and uptake by plants at a minimum;
* Changing the times when animal waste is applied to the land and holding the waste in tanks until application.

The restrictions are within Good Agricultural Practice guidelines, meaning that farmers are expected to adhere to the given regulations without receiving any subsidies. Farmers who do not adhere to these restrictions can be fined by the government.

== Locations ==
Nitrate vulnerable zones were introduced by the United Kingdom government in response to the European Union mandate that all countries in the EU must reduce the nitrate in drinking water to a maximum of 50 NO3− mg/L to protect public health and environmental health.

=== United Kingdom ===
The United Kingdom identifies nitrate vulnerable zones as discrete zones in specific agricultural regions. There are at least 70 nitrate vulnerable zones in England and several in Wales, covering 600,000 hectares of surface water and ground water. 

==== Wales ====
The Welsh Government introduced an all Wales NVZ in 2021, previously, 2.4% of Wales&#x27; land was designated as a NVZ. Environmental and fishing groups welcomed the new rules. It will be rolled out, pending a review by the Senedd, over the next three years. The review came after major political backlash from opposition parties and farmers.

=== Northern Europe ===
Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark have established their entire nations as nitrate vulnerable zones. These countries take a broader approach to designating nation-wide nitrate vulnerable zones because of the quality of the groundwater as well as marine eutrophication.

<text>Mount Kinabalu (Dusun: &quot;Gayo Ngaran&quot; or &quot;Nulu Nabalu&quot;, ) is the highest mountain in Borneo and Malaysia. With an elevation of , it is the third-highest peak of an island on Earth, the 28th highest peak in Southeast Asia, and 20th most prominent mountain in the world. The mountain is located in Ranau district, West Coast Division of Sabah, Malaysia. It is protected as Kinabalu Park, a World Heritage Site.

In 1997, a re-survey using satellite technology was conducted. It established Mount Kinabalu had a summit (known as Low&#x27;s Peak) height of above sea level, some less than the hitherto published figure of .

The mountain and its surroundings have exceptional biodiversity, with between 5,000 and 6,000 species of plants, 326 species of birds, and over 100 mammalian species identified. Among this rich collection of wildlife are famous species such as the gigantic &quot;Rafflesia&quot; plants and orangutans.

Low&#x27;s Peak can be climbed by a person in good physical condition without mountaineering equipment on the main route. However, climbers must be accompanied by accredited guides at all times due to national park regulations and the risk of experiencing altitude sickness.

== Geology ==
Mount Kinabalu is a massive pluton formed from granodiorite which is intrusive into sedimentary and ultrabasic rocks, and forms the central part, or core, of the Kinabalu massif. The granodiorite is intrusive into strongly folded strata, probably of Eocene to Miocene age, and associated ultrabasic and basic igneous rocks. It was pushed up from the Earth&#x27;s crust as molten rock millions of years ago. In geological terms, it is a very young mountain as the granodiorite cooled and hardened only about 10 million years ago.

The present landform is considered to be a mid-Pliocene peneplain, arched and deeply dissected, through which the Kinabalu granodiorite body has risen in isostatic adjustment. It is still gaining roughly of height per annum. 

During the Pleistocene Epoch of about 100,000 years ago, the mountain was covered by sheets of ice and glaciers. As these glaciers flowed down its slopes, they scouring the surface of Mount Kinabalu in the process and creating the deep Low&#x27;s Gully (named after Hugh Low) on its north side. Its granitic composition and the glacial formative processes are readily apparent when viewing its craggy rocky peaks.
===IUGS geological heritage site===
In respect of it being &#x27;one of the youngest granitic intrusions exposed on Earth and the site of spectacular tropical glacial landscapes&#x27;, the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) included the &#x27;Mount Kinabalu Neogene granite&#x27; in its assemblage of 100 &#x27;geological heritage sites&#x27; around the world in a listing published in October 2022. The organisation defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as &#x27;a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history.&#x27;

== Climate ==
The climate of the mountain varies from humid tropical at its base to alpine at its summit. The temperature at the summit of Mount Kinabalu ranges from from December to January, and from June to September. Due how cold the mountain remains from December to January, there are a few occasions where frost and ice appear at the summit of Mount Kinabalu. Snow has been recorded three times in this area; in 1975, 1993 and 2022.

== Biology ==
Mount Kinabalu, along with other upland areas of the Crocker Mountains, is known worldwide for its biodiversity with plants of Himalayan, Australasian, and Indomalayan origin. A recent botanical survey of the mountain estimated a staggering 5,000 to 6,000 plant species (excluding mosses and liverworts but including ferns) thrive upon the mountain. It is therefore one of the world&#x27;s most important biological sites. A reason for its rich diversity and endemisms is that its extreme height provides refuge to cold-adapted species during interglacials.

In 2015, a major Malaysian-Dutch study showed that the unique flora, fauna, and fungi on the mountain summit are younger than the mountain itself, and have evolved from both local and distant montane ancestors.

=== Flora ===
The flora of the mountain varies with elevation and geology. Lowland forest extends up to about 1500 metres elevation, and consists of two main types, based on the dominant tree species – mixed dipterocarp forest and mixed Casuarina forest. Lowland forests generally have a closed canopy 40 meters tall, along with an understory stratum of lower trees, and an emergent stratum of taller trees which extend above the canopy.

Montane rain forest, also known as cloud forest, extends from approximately 1400 metres elevation up to 2900 metres. Montane forest typically has a closed canopy with single stratum, and the canopy height generally decreases with elevation. Typical trees include species of the plant families Fagaceae and Lauraceae, with conifers increasingly abundant at higher elevations. The lower montane forests have a high diversity of orchid and fern species. Carnivorous plants, including species of &quot;Nepenthes&quot;, &quot;Drosera&quot;, and &quot;Utricularia&quot;, are most diverse between 2200 and 2550 meters elevation, in areas with high rainfall and a stunted, open tree canopy. The montane forests are interspersed with areas of graminoid scrub, generally associated with hypermagnesic cambisol soils.

Sub-alpine scrub extends from . It includes short trees and shrubs such the conifer &quot;Dacrydium gibbsiae&quot;, &quot;Leptospermum recurvum&quot;, and species from the plant families Myrtaceae and Ericaceae, along with dwarf shrubs, mosses, lichens, liverworts, and ferns. Orchids are abundant and diverse in subalpine and alpine plant communities, except for at the highest summits. Above 3,500 meters conditions are too extreme for trees, and above 3,700 meters persistent ground frost limits plants to the hardiest grasses, sedges and dwarf shrubs, including &quot;Leptospermum recurvatum&quot; and &quot;Rhododendron ericoides&quot;, which grow in crevices and other sheltered areas on the rocky summits.
The plants of Mount Kinabalu have high levels of biodiversity and endemism (i.e. species which are found only within Kinabalu Park and are not found anywhere else in the world). Orchids are the best-known example, with 866 species in 134 genera, including species of &quot;Bulbophyllum, Dendrobium, Coelogyne, Liparis&quot;, and &quot;Calanthe&quot;, and some of the highly valued &quot;Paphiopedilum&quot; slipper orchids. There are also over 600 species of ferns (more than the whole of Africa&#x27;s 500 species) of which 50 are found nowhere else. Mount Kinabalu has the richest collection in the world of &quot;Nepenthes&quot; pitcher plants (five of the thirteen are found nowhere else on earth), some of which reach spectacular proportions (the largest-pitchered in the world being the endemic &quot;Nepenthes rajah&quot;). The parasitic &quot;Rafflesia&quot; plant, which has the largest single flower in the world, is also found in Kinabalu (particularly &quot;Rafflesia keithii&quot; whose flower grows to in diameter), though blooms of the flower are rare and difficult to find. Meanwhile, another &quot;Rafflesia&quot; species, &quot;Rafflesia tengku-adlinii&quot;, can be found on the neighbouring Mount Trus Madi and the nearby Maliau Basin.

Mount Kinabalu&#x27;s above-average biodiversity in plant life is due to a combination of several unique factors: its setting in one of the richest plant regions of the world (the tropical biogeographical region known as western Malesia which comprises the island of Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, and the island of Borneo), the fact that the mountain covers a wide climatic range from near sea level to freezing ground conditions near the summit, the jagged terrain and diversity of rocks and soils, the high levels of rainfall (averaging about a year at park HQ), and the climatic instability caused by periods of glaciation and catastrophic droughts which result in evolution and speciation. This diversity is greatest in the lowland regions (consisting of lowland dipterocarp forests, so called because the tree family Dipterocarpaceae are dominant). However, most of Kinabalu&#x27;s endemic species are found in the mountain forests, particularly on ultramafic soils.

The ultramafic rocks which make up parts of the mountain create soils rich in certain metallic elements (nickel, cobalt, chromium, and manganese), high cation imbalances (high Mg:Ca molar quotients), and deficiencies of some nutrients including potassium and phosphorus. These soil conditions affect the plant life, and plant communities on ultramafic soils show lower stature and lower biomass, higher levels of endemism, and a distinct species composition compared to plant communities at similar elevations elsewhere on the mountain.

=== Fauna ===

The variety of plant life is also habitat for a great variety of birds and mammals. There are some 326 species of birds in Kinabalu Park, including the spectacular rhinoceros hornbill, mountain serpent-eagle, Dulit frogmouth, eyebrowed jungle flycatcher, and bare-headed laughingthrush. Twenty-four birds are mainly found on the mountain. The mountain is home to some 100 mammalian species mostly living high in the trees, including one of the great apes, the Bornean orangutan (though sightings of these are uncommon; estimates of its numbers in the park range from 25 to 120). Other mammals include three kinds of deer, the Malayan weasel (&quot;Mustela nudipes&quot;), Oriental small-clawed otter (&quot;Aonyx cinerea&quot;), and leopard cat (&quot;Prionailurus bengalensis&quot;). Endemic mammals include the black shrew (&quot;Suncus ater&quot;). However, others of its endemics, such as the Bornean ferret-badger (&quot;Melogale everetti&quot;) and &quot;Rattus baluensis&quot;, have also recently been recorded in the nearby Mount Tambuyukon.

Endemic annelids number less than a dozen known species but include the Kinabalu giant red leech that preys on various earthworms, including the Kinabalu giant earthworm. In the summit zone, at least 26 endemic species of land snail exist. In 2012, a major scientific expedition, jointly organised by the Malaysian Sabah Parks and the Dutch Naturalis Biodiversity Center, performed DNA analysis of several dozen endemic flora, fauna, and fungi, to understand the evolutionary origin of the unique biodiversity of Kinabalu.

=== Threats and preservation ===

The steep mountainsides with poor soil are not suitable for farming or for the timber industry so the habitats and animal life of Kinabalu remain largely intact, with about a third of the original habitat now degraded. Kinabalu Park was established in 1964 and the nearby mountains were protected as the Crocker Range National Park in 1984. However even national park status does not guarantee full protection, as logging permits were granted on Trus Madi in 1984. 
== History ==
British colonial administrator Hugh Low made the first recorded ascent of Mount Kinabalu&#x27;s summit plateau in March 1851 with local Dusun guide Lemaing of Kampung Kiau. Low did not scale the mountain&#x27;s highest peak, however, considering it &quot;inaccessible to any but winged animals&quot;. In April and July 1858, Low was accompanied on two further ascents by Spenser St. John, the British Consul in Brunei. The highest point of Mount Kinabalu was finally reached in 1888 by zoologist John Whitehead. British botanist Lilian Gibbs became the first woman and the first botanist to summit Mount Kinabalu in February 1910.

Botanist E. J. H. Corner led two important expeditions of the Royal Society of Great Britain to the mountain in 1961 and 1964. Kinabalu National Park was established in 1964. The park was designated a natural World Heritage Site in 2000.

=== 2015 earthquake ===

On 5 June 2015 at 07:15 MST, the area around Mount Kinabalu was damaged by an earthquake. Eighteen people, including hikers and mountain guides, were killed by the earthquake and a massive landslide that followed it. Ranau and many parts of Sabah West Coast were affected and Donkey Ear&#x27;s Peak was heavily damaged.

Six days before the earthquake, a group of ten western tourists (comprising six men and four women from Canada, Germany, Netherlands and the United Kingdom) had stripped naked and urinated while on the mountain&#x27;s summit. Local people were deeply offended, and many who considered Kinabalu to be a sacred place believed that the act had angered the mountain spirits. Four of the group were convicted on charges of public indecency, and sentenced to three days in jail and a fine of 5,000 ringgit.

Following the incident, some of the tourists and their families expressed their apologies to all involved parties, and the government of the United Kingdom began to review its travel advice for Malaysia.

== Climbing the mountain ==

Climbers must be accompanied by accredited guides at all times due to national park regulations. There are two main starting points for the climb: the Timpohon Gate (located from Kinabalu Park Headquarters, at an altitude of ), and the Mesilau Nature Resort. The latter starting point is slightly higher in elevation, but crosses a ridge, adding about two kilometres to the ascent and making the total elevation gain slightly higher. The Mesilau Trail is no longer accessible due to the earthquake in 2015. The two trails meet about before Laban Rata.

Sabah Parks grants a summit-climbing permit only to climbers who stay at mountain huts. Due to the limited number of beds at the mountain huts, only 130 people are allowed to climb Mount Kinabalu per day.

Accommodation is available inside the park or outside near the headquarters. Sabah Parks has privatised Mount Kinabalu activities to an organisation called Sutera Sanctuary Lodges. The mountain may be climbed on a single day trip, or hikers may (usually) stay one night at Laban Rata Resthouse at to complete the climb in 2 days, finishing the ascent and descending on the second day. The majority of climbers begin the ascent on day one of a two-day hike from Timpohon gate at , reaching this location either by minibus or by walking, and then walk to Laban Rata. Most people accomplish this part of the climb in 3 to 6 hours. Since there are no roads, the supplies for the Laban Rata Resthouse are carried by porters, who sometimes bring more than of supplies on their backs. Hot food and beverages are available at Laban Rata. Most rooms have no hot water in the bathrooms and whilst the dining area is heated, most rooms are not. The last , from the Laban Rata Resthouse at to Low&#x27;s Peak (summit) at , takes between 2 and 4 hours. The last part of the climb is on bare granite rock.

Given the high altitude, some people may suffer from altitude sickness although staying overnight at the lodges before the climb and climbing at a lower rate of ascent may reduce the likelihood of this happening.

=== Low&#x27;s Gully ===
Low&#x27;s Gully (named after Hugh Low who first looked down into it in 1851) is a deep gorge carved out by glaciation on the north side of Mount Kinabalu, which is exceptionally inhospitable due to its depth and high rainfall. In March 1994 two British Army officers were severely criticised after leading a party of 7 British and 3 Hong Kong soldiers in an attempt to abseil and climb down into the gully that required extensive rescue efforts from both the RAF and the Malaysian army. The party were not equipped with radios and the 2 officers and 3 Hong Kong soldiers were trapped for 16 days and did not eat for five days before being rescued when stretchers were lowered by helicopter. The breakaway party of five completed the first descent of the gully in three days. A book about the 31-day fight for survival entitled &quot;Descent into Chaos&quot; was published in 1996 and a film drama &quot;The Place of the Dead&quot; was released in 1997. The first successful complete descent of Low&#x27;s Gully was achieved by a 27 strong joint Malaysian-British team led by mountaineer and former British Army officer Pat Gunson in 1998.

== Naming myths ==


Several narratives exist that explain the primary beliefs surrounding the mountain&#x27;s name.

The most plausible origin of the word &quot;Kinabalu&quot; is believed to be derived from the Dusun phrase &#x27;Aki Nabalu,&#x27; signifying &quot;the revered place of the dead&quot; . Another possible interpretation attributes the name to the Dusun expression &quot;tina balu,&quot; which translates to &quot;a widow mother,&quot; suggesting that tina balu may represent the spirit of the mountain itself. Alternatively, some propose that &quot;Kinabalu&quot; results from the combination of two Dusun words, &quot;ki&quot; (have/has) and &quot;nabalu&quot; (mountain), forming &quot;ki-nabalu&quot; or &quot;have mountain.&quot; It is a common practice among the Dusun people to name places based on their distinctive features or characteristics, exemplified by the place called &quot;kiwaig,&quot; meaning &quot;having water.

A popular story told to Western and Chinese tourists states that the name &quot;Kinabalu&quot; actually means &quot;Cina Balu&quot; (meaning &quot;A Chinese Widow&quot;). Due to the lingual influence among the Kadazan Dusun of Sabah, the pronunciation for the word &quot;cina&quot; (chee-na) was changed to &quot;Kina&quot; (kee-na). An earlier book by Spenser St. John published in 1863 mentioned the Kina Balu (Chinese widow) as a reference to the mountain. This story lacks coherence due to the likelihood that the Dusun people, who have lived in the area for approximately 6000 years, would not have been aware of the term &quot;Cina&quot; (Chinese in Malay) and thus could not have adapted it to &quot;Kina&quot; to refer to Chinese people or China. The Chinese language itself employs distinct words to represent Chinese individuals or the country of China, making the proposed adaptation very unlikely.

<text>Casa Grande (O&#x27;odham: &quot;Wainom Wo:g&quot;) is a city in Pinal County, approximately halfway between Phoenix and Tucson in the U.S. state of Arizona. According to U.S. Census estimates, as of 2020 the population of the city was 55,653. It is named after the Casa Grande Ruins National Monument, which is actually located in Coolidge. &quot;Casa Grande&quot; is Spanish for &quot;big house&quot;. Among resident English speakers, there is no consensus on how to pronounce the city&#x27;s name.

Local governance is by a Mayor, six Council Members and a City Manager.

==History==
Casa Grande was founded in 1879 during the Arizona mining boom, specifically due to the presence of the Southern Pacific Railroad. In January 1880, the community of Terminus, meaning &quot;end-of-the-line,&quot; was established despite consisting of just five residents and three buildings. In September 1880, railroad executives renamed the settlement Casa Grande, after the Hohokam ruins at the nearby Casa Grande Ruins National Monument. Casa Grande grew slowly, and suffered several setbacks both in 1886 and 1893, when fires ravaged the town, destroying all wooden housing structures within it. When the mining boom slowed in the 1890s, the town was nearly abandoned, but with the advent of agriculture, the town remained alive and well, and was eventually incorporated in 1915.

One of the founding fathers of Casa Grande was Thompson Rodney Peart. Peart Road, Peart Park, and the Peart Center, all of which are notable fixtures of Casa Grande, are named after him.

Casa Grande was home to a collective farm society which was part of the Farm Security Administration.

From 1942 to 1945, a Japanese-American relocation camp was set up outside of Casa Grande, known as the Gila River War Relocation Center. Two notable people that were interned there were future actor Pat Morita and baseball player Kenichi Zenimura, who constructed a baseball field and set up a league in the relocation camp.

Casa Grande is home to Francisco Grande Hotel &amp; Golf Resort, former spring training location for the San Francisco Giants. Then owner, Horace Stoneham, began developing the property in 1959. The first exhibition game was played in Casa Grande in 1961, with Willie Mays hitting a home run. The San Francisco Giants no longer play at Francisco Grande, but the pool in a baseball bat and ball shape remains in memory of the past ballgames.

During the Cold War, Casa Grande was the location of the Casa Grande Photogrammetric Test Range. These targets consisted of concrete arrows located in and to the south of the city, which calibrated aerial cartographic cameras.

Casa Grande has also played a prominent role in semi-pro and collegiate baseball. The Casa Grande Cotton Kings, who were founded in 1948, qualified to play in the National Baseball Congress World Series ten straight times by winning Arizona state championships in the 1940s and 1950s, and were reactivated in the 2000s. They are now members of the Pacific Southwest Baseball League.

Over time, the city has become home to many Phoenix or Tucson urbanites who own homes in Casa Grande. Most residents either commute north to work in the Phoenix metropolitan area, or to the south, to work in Tucson. This trend has contributed to growth in the service industry of Casa Grande. Many new businesses such as restaurants, gas stations, and retail outlets are opening throughout the city in order to keep up with demand from the growing population.

A retail shopping mall operates in southern Casa Grande. Phase one of The Promenade at Casa Grande opened on November 16, 2007. Built by Westcor and the Pederson Group, it is similar to Desert Ridge Marketplace (an outdoor shopping center in northeast Phoenix). The Promenade at Casa Grande is an outdoor mall, built on a patch of desert, and contains nearly a million square feet. An additional $11 million was spent by the city to fund the reconstruction of the Florence Blvd./I-10 freeway overpass.

Ehrmann Commonwealth Dairy operates a major dairy processing facility in the town that opened in 2013 and employs about 110 people.

<text>Coolidge is a city in Pinal County, Arizona, United States. According to the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population is 13,218.

Coolidge is home of the Casa Grande Ruins National Monument. The monument was the first historic site to receive protected status by the United States Government in 1892. Coolidge is also home to both Central Arizona College and the Central Arizona Valley Institute of Technology.

==History==
The area containing what is now the City of Coolidge was occupied by the Hohokam, an indigenous ancient Sonoran Desert people who built a massive compound consisting many of caliche structures and remained in the area for over 1,000 years. The only remaining and preserved structure from this compound is the Casa Grande Ruins National Monument.

The modern history of the city is centered around agriculture, particularly cotton. Coolidge was founded in 1925 when R.J. Jones laid out an site during the construction of the Coolidge Dam on the nearby Gila River, which was completed in 1930. Both the dam and the townsite were named for Calvin Coolidge, the 30th President of the United States. The dam made the sandy soil native to the area into very rich farmland, and soon vast expanses of desert were plowed and acres of cotton were planted. This is when the area&#x27;s status as the hub of the Arizona cotton industry was solidified and led to the incorporation of Coolidge as a city in 1945.

Levi Ruggles, a veteran of the American Civil War, founded the town of Florence on the south bank of the Gila River. He came to Arizona Territory in 1866 as a U.S. Indian Agent. Recognizing the agricultural potential of the valley, he found an easily fordable crossing on the Gila River and surveyed a townsite there. With the aid of Governor R.C. McCormick, he secured a post office in August of the same year. Ruggles held numerous public offices including that of Territorial Legislator. Florence became the county seat in the newly formed Pinal County. Silver was discovered in 1875 in the nearby mountains which led to the creation of the famous Silver King Mine.

===Adamsville===
In 1870, Fred Adams founded a farming community two miles west of the original Florence townsite. The farming town had stores, homes, a post office, a flour mill, and water tanks, It was named Adamsville. In the 1900s (decade), the Gila River overflowed after a storm and ran over its banks. Most of the small town was wiped out and the residents moved to Florence. The area where the town was established is now a ghost town and is currently within the boundaries of Florence. At the junction of Highway 79 and 287 there is a historical marker about Adamsville.

A canal was built in the 1880s which enabled water from the Gila River to be diverted for irrigation. Farming and ranching then played a major role in Florence&#x27;s economy. All of the federal land transactions for Southern Arizona were conducted in Florence until 1881, when the Federal Land Office was moved to Tucson.

===Tunnel Saloon Gabriel-Phy shootout of 1888===
One of the most notable gunfights in the Old Southwest occurred in Florence. Sheriff Pete Gabriel hired thirty-nine year old Joseph (Joe) Phy as his deputy in 1883. Gabriel decided to not run for sheriff in 1886 and supported his deputy Phy for the job. Later Gabriel withdrew his support because of personal differences with Phy. The two friends became bitter enemies and had a confrontation on May 31, 1888, in the Tunnel Saloon. A gunfight ensued and spread to the street. Both men received gunshot wounds. Phy died a few hours after the gunfight, but Gabriel survived the encounter and died 10 years later.

===Second Pinal County Courthouse===
The second Pinal County Courthouse was built in 1891. It was the site where the trials of three notorious women were presented. They were Pearl Heart, Eva Dugan and Winnie Ruth Judd, known as the &quot;Trunk Murderess&quot;. Pearl Hart (birth surname: Taylor) was an outlaw of the American Old West. She committed one of the last recorded stagecoach robberies in the United States; her crime gained notoriety primarily because of her gender. She was tried in 1899 and was acquitted, however the judge ordered a second trial and she was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison.

In the 1930s Eva Dugan was convicted of murder. She was sentenced to be executed by hanging. However, it resulted in her decapitation and influenced the State of Arizona to replace hanging with the gas chamber as a method of execution.

Winnie Ruth Judd was a Phoenix medical secretary who was found guilty of murdering and dismembering her friends Agnes Anne LeRoi and Hedvig Samuelson over the alleged affections of her lover Jack Halloran. The jury found her guilty of first-degree murder on February 8, 1932. An appeal was unsuccessful. Her trial was marked by sensationalized newspaper coverage and suspicious circumstances. Judd was sentenced to be hanged February 17, 1933, and sent to the Arizona State Prison in Florence. The sentence she received raised debate about capital punishment. Her death sentence was overturned after a ten-day hearing found her mentally incompetent; she was then sent to Arizona State Asylum for the Insane on April 24, 1933.

===Tom Mix Monument===
In 1940, the cowboy movie star Tom Mix was killed when he lost control of his speeding Cord Phaeton convertible and rolled into a dry wash (now called the Tom Mix Wash) in Florence, Arizona. Mix, who was a regular tenant in the Ross/Fryer–Cushman House, was returning to Florence from Tucson. There is a 2-foot–tall iron statue of a riderless horse with a plaque on the site of the accident.

<text>Maricopa is a city in the Gila River Valley in Pinal County, Arizona, United States. With 66,290 residents as of 2022, Maricopa is the largest incorporated municipality in Pinal County.

==History==
Maricopa has had three locations over the years: Maricopa Wells, Maricopaville and Maricopa Junction; the latter gradually became known as Maricopa. It started as an oasis around a series of watering holes eight miles north of present-day Maricopa, and about a mile west of Pima Butte. European-American traders and travelers called it Maricopa Wells. Several of Arizona&#x27;s rivers, the Gila, Santa Cruz, Vekol and Santa Rosa provided this oasis in the desert with an ample supply of water during this period of time.

During the late 1800s, Maricopa Wells was one of the most important relay stations along the San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line and the later more famous Butterfield Overland Mail Route. Today, very little remains of this once bustling community, but it played an important part in the progress and development of the Southwest. It was one of the best-known spots in Arizona during this period of time because it had a reliable source of water, and offered an abundant supply of food. The peaceful Pima and Maricopa farmers who lived and farmed nearby sold supplies to travelers and migrants.

The most prosperous period of time for Maricopa Wells was in the 1870s. During this time the trading center at the Wells provided water and food for not only the east–west travelers, but those who traveled to the north to Phoenix. Fairly good roads had been built by James A. Moore, the proprietor at Maricopa Wells, to all points north, and the Wells was a constant hubbub of activity.

Maricopaville developed south and west of the Wells, following construction of a railroad line from this terminus to Phoenix. In 1879, the Southern Pacific Railroad was in the process of building a railroad line from Yuma to Tucson, and a second railroad line was to be built from Maricopaville, wrapping around the western edge of South Mountain into Phoenix. With the railroad, Maricopaville took on the appearance of a gold rush California boom town, as men worked day and night building hotels, saloons, warehouses, restaurants, theaters, etc. One local newspaper at the time reckoned that with its thousands of people and good location, Maricopaville would be an ideal choice for the location of the state capital.

But the railroad never built the anticipated line from Maricopaville into Phoenix. Tempe also wanted to be on the railroad line and lobbied the territorial government to gain a stop. Officials agreed. The settlement known as Maricopaville was essentially rebuilt three miles to the east (to the present location of Maricopa) in the early 1880s, in order to accommodate the Maricopa &amp; Phoenix line, planned to go through Kyrene and Tempe to the north on the way to Phoenix. The first train departed from Maricopa for Phoenix on July 4, 1887. All east–west rail travelers had to stop at Maricopa, and those who wanted to go north had to shift to the M &amp; P Railroad.

Maricopa was officially incorporated as a city on October 15, 2003, becoming the 88th incorporated municipality in Arizona. Between 2000 and 2010, the city&#x27;s population grew from 1,040 residents to 43,482, an increase of 4080%. In 2018, estimates approved by the US Census Bureau and Arizona State Demographer&#x27;s Office put Maricopa&#x27;s population at 51,977 pushing the city over the 50,000 mark for the first time. Furthermore, data released from the official 2020 Census in August 2021 put Maricopa at 58,125, surpassing Casa Grande to become the most populous incorporated place in Pinal County and second most populous place in the county overall, behind the unincorporated San Tan Valley. Population of Maricopa has continued to grow, reaching 66,290 residents as of 2022; a 6.2% increase from 2021, making Maricopa the 12th fastest growing municipality in the United States and second fastest growing in Arizona (behind Queen Creek, which is partially in Pinal County).

A part of the city is within the boundaries of the Ak-Chin Indian Community. The small, federally recognized tribe has developed Harrah&#x27;s Ak-Chin Casino and related resort, a multi-entertainment cinema complex, and operates a golf course; all are open to the public and draw attendees from Maricopa as well as the greater Phoenix area. In addition the tribe operates the Ak-Chin Regional Airport and an industrial park. A 2011 study said that its casino and resort made up a large part of the economy of Pinal County, in terms of number of jobs and revenue generated.

<text>Oracle is a census-designated place (CDP) in Pinal County, Arizona, United States. The population was 3,686 at the 2010 Census, falling to 3,051 at the 2020 Census.

Oracle State Park is adjacent. The Arizona Trail passes through the Park and community.
Oracle is the gateway to the road up the north face of Mount Lemmon, which starts off of American Avenue and currently offers a secondary route to the top. Prior to the construction of the Catalina Highway on the opposite side of the Santa Catalina range, the Oracle Control Road was the only road access to the mountain community of Summerhaven. The term &quot;control road&quot; derives from the fact that the direction of traffic was restricted to one-way only, either up or down at alternate times of day, to prevent motorists from having to pass one another on the narrow, steep road. This route is now popular mainly with off-road 4x4 drivers and with off-road or dual-purpose motorcyclists, and should not be attempted by regular passenger cars or street motorcycles. This road ends at the Catalina Highway near Loma Linda.

The community is the location of the Biosphere 2 experiment. Oracle was also the postal address for environmentalist author Edward Abbey, who never lived in the town but visited often. Buffalo Bill Cody owned the High Jinks Gold Mine in Oracle briefly and, in 1911, appeared as &quot;Santa&quot; for a group of local children. Oracle is becoming a bedroom community for Tucson, Arizona, but large-scale development is opposed by many residents.

== History ==

The name &quot;Oracle&quot; comes from early prospectors. Albert Weldon came to the area looking for gold and silver. He and some other companions named their first mine &quot;The Oracle&quot; after the ship Weldon had traveled on. The community was later named after its first mine, and thus, indirectly, after a ship.

The community began to grow in the late 1870s, as gold and silver were discovered, and the Christmas and New Year mines opened. By 1880, a post office had been established.

The community also became a retreat for people suffering from tuberculosis. The Acadia Ranch – built in Oracle in 1882 by Edwin S. and Lillian Dodge – was, during this time, a sanitorium.

===Alternative history===
On January 1, 2017, in the &quot;Arizona Daily Star&quot; newspaper, historian David Leighton challenged the accepted history of the town of Oracle:

He wrote that Albert Weldon who was born about 1840 in New Brunswick, Canada, traveled on his uncle Capt. A.D. Wood&#x27;s ship Oracle around Cape Horn at the tip of South America and arrived in California between 1857 and 1860. Weldon enlisted as a private in Company E, 5th California Infantry, of the Union Army, in 1861. This unit was attached to the California Column and soon marched to Tucson where Weldon was posted at a nearby stage station before moving east and eventually being honorably discharged in Mesilla New Mexico in 1864.

After his military service he returned to California and was involved in mining and also lumber. In 1876 he returned to Arizona. Within a couple of years he found a partner in Irishman Jimmie Lee and both men traveled northeast of Tucson into the Santa Catalina Mountains in search of precious metal. Soon he found a mining claim and named it Oracle in honor of his uncle&#x27;s ship.

The ship Oracle was built under the supervision of Captain Charles E. Ranlett and was constructed for the shipbuilding firm Chapman &amp; Flint of Maine. It was launched in 1853 and was a temperance ship (one that didn&#x27;t allow alcohol aboard) and sailed to ports across the globe including Melbourne, Australia and Shanghai, China. It was captained by Weldon&#x27;s uncle for several years.

Weldon was soon joined by Alexander McKay, an immigrant from Scotland who located two mining claims named Christmas and New Years because of the days they were discovered. McKay also built a one-room house, the first in the area, and from it, the village grew. When it was time for a post office to be named, Oracle was the name eventually chosen.

Leighton stated that the town of Oracle takes its name from the Oracle Mine which took its name from the ship Oracle and that he believes the ship took its name from an oraclea shrine dedicated to a particular god where people went to consult a priest or priestess in times of trouble or uncertaintycalled the Temple of Apollo at Didyma in present-day Aydin Province, Turkey, not the oracle at Delphi, Greece believed by some to be the origin of the name. He also explained that there were two ships named Oracle made by the same shipbuilder, the second one being launched in 1876 but that this later ship wasn&#x27;t the boat that Weldon traveled on, as some sources have said.

== Climate ==

Oracle has a cold semi-arid climate at an altitude of .

== Ecology ==

Flora includes emory oak, point-leaf manzanita, holly-leaf buckthorn, alligator juniper, velvet mesquite, netleaf hackberry, lemonade berry, oreganillo, Thurber’s desert honeysuckle, ocotillo, turpentine bush, yellow bells, golden-flowered agave, mescal agave, sotol, soaptree yucca, beargrass, Engelman’s prickly pear, fishhook barrel cactus, cane cholla, firecracker penstemon, showy four o’clock, sacred datura, Goodding verbena, fairy duster, tufted evening primrose, Arizona mariposa lily, deer grass, and Parry’s grama.

Fauna includes greater roadrunner, common raven, acorn woodpecker, great horned owl, zone-tailed hawk, Cooper’s hawk, wild turkey, Gambel’s quail, cactus wren, curve-billed thrasher, hooded oriole, northern cardinal, Lucy’s warbler, vermilion flycatcher, broad-billed hummingbird, Gila monster, Clark’s spiny lizard, Madrean alligator lizard, coachwhip, gopher snake, red-spotted toad, canyon tree frog, black swalllowtail, white-lined sphinx, Arizona sister, Sonoran bumblebee, tarantula hawk, western short-horn walkingstick, western rhinoceros beetle, darkling beetles, rainbow grasshopper, flame skimmer, Arizona mantis, green lynx spider, desert blonde tarantula, Arizona bark scorpion, mule deer, cougar, bobcat, gray fox, coyote, striped skunk, javelina, white-nosed coati, rock squirrel, desert cottontail, and big brown bat.

The Oracle region once sustained more extensive and biodiverse grassland ecosystems, but widespread and poorly regulated cattle ranching has largely depleted them. An ongoing transition to a mesquite/opuntia/invasive grass-dominated landscape is occurring.

== Geology ==
Oracle and the surrounding area sit largely on a slab of granite called &quot;Oracle granite&quot; that is visible as red or grey-and-white speckled &quot;boulders&quot; rising over the scrub and grass. It is mostly porphyritic biotite Precambrian granite with large microcline phenocrysts, and has occasional inclusions of white and milky quartz and pegmatite. The granite rarely contains ore and veins of gold or silver, and sometimes copper.

==Geography==

<text>San Manuel is a census-designated place (CDP) in Pinal County, Arizona, United States. The population was 3,551 at the 2010 census.

San Manuel was built in 1953 by Del E. Webb Construction Company as a company town to serve the then-new San Manuel copper mine, mill and smelter complex. In 1955 the San Manuel Arizona Railroad was built to connect with the Copper Basin Railway at Hayden. When copper prices fell in the late 1990s, BHP, the owner of the mine and smelter complex shuttered both operations in June 1999. The closing saw 2,500 people lose their jobs. The mine and smelter were permanently closed in 2003.

<text>Superior (Western Apache: Yooʼ Łigai) is a town in northern Pinal County, Arizona, United States, and is the oldest town in the county. According to the 2020 census, the population of the town was 2,407. Superior was founded as a mining town for the Silver King and the later Magma mines; silver was mined at first, and then transitioned to copper. Currently, exploitation of the huge Resolution Copper deposit is being explored.

==History==

Like nearby Globe, Ray, and Clifton, Arizona, Superior was once part of a huge Apache reservation, but after silver and copper deposits were discovered, those areas were withdrawn from the reservation and returned to the public domain.

In 1872, at the height of the American Indian Wars, a band of raiding Apache horsemen were ambushed by a United States Cavalry force from Picket Post Mountain. After losing 50 men, the Apache retreated up the mountain later named &quot;Apache Leap&quot;. According to local legend, in the face of defeat, the remaining Apache leapt to their death rather than being captured by the cavalry, thus giving the mountain its name.

Superior was originally called Queen, then Hastings, and under the latter name was platted in 1900.

Queen had a population of around 100 circa 1880. There was a general store, 2 hotels, numerous saloons, and a post office. The Queen post office closed September 15, 1881.

The Superior townsite was laid out in 1902, and named after the Lake Superior and Arizona Copper Company (LS&amp;A). The Superior post office opened on December 29, 1902.

By 1950, before the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision, schools in Superior segregated Anglo and Mexican students.

==Silver King Mine==

The Silver King Mine began on March 22, 1875, when Charles G. Mason and four companions found native silver, and staked the Silver King claim. On March 29, 1875, the Silver Queen (Magma) vein was staked, and the Silver Queen Mining Company was organized in 1880. However, with the depletion of silver, the Silver Queen shut down in 1893, and the Silver King in 1896. In 1910, William Boyce Thompson and George Gunn bought the Silver Queen Mine, and organized the Magma Copper Company. A 300-ton-per-day concentrator was built in 1914. In 1915, a narrow-gauge railway connected Superior with the Southern Pacific Railroad, which was converted to standard gauge in 1923. A smelter was built in 1924.

After 71 years of production, the Magma Mine closed in August 1982 due to high operating costs and declining copper prices. Operations resumed in September 1990, but the mine closed again on June 28, 1996. During its 86-year life (1910–1996), the Magma produced about 27.6 million short tons of ore averaging about 4.9% copper, recovering about 1,300,000 short tons of copper, 36,550 short tons of zinc, 686,000 ounces of gold, and 34.3 million ounces of silver.

The old Magma No. 9 shaft atop Apache Leap is being used to explore the huge Resolution Copper deposit below.

==Winemaking==
Elgin is the first location in Arizona to engage in commercial scale winemaking. In the 1970s, Gordon Dutt, Ph.D., a soil scientist from the University of Arizona, was intrigued with the similarity between the soil of the Elgin-Sonoita area and that of Burgundy, France. In partnership with A. Blake Brophy, he developed an experimental winery that later developed into the Sonoita Vineyards and that encouraged other vineyards in the area. Presently, growers in the area produce Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Mission, and Syrah grapes. In 2009 there were nine vineyards in the region, producing about 50,000 gallons of wine yearly.

Elgin hosts several wine festivals throughout the year, most notably the St. Martin&#x27;s Day festival and the Fall festival.

The expansion of winemaking in the Elgin-Sonoita area has led to establishment of fine restaurants and bed and breakfasts and has regenerated the economy of this lightly populated, rural area.

<text>Nogales (; or ) is a city in and the county seat of Santa Cruz County, Arizona. The population was 20,837 at the 2010 census and estimated 20,103 in 2019. Nogales forms part of the larger Tucson–Nogales combined statistical area, with a total population of 1,027,683 as of the 2010 Census.

Nogales forms Arizona&#x27;s largest transborder agglomeration with its adjacent, much larger twin Nogales, Sonora, across the Mexican border. The southern terminus of Interstate 19 is located in Nogales at the U.S.–Mexico border; the highway continues south into Mexico as Mexico Federal Highway 15. The highways meeting in Nogales are a major road intersection in the CANAMEX Corridor, connecting Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Nogales also is the beginning of the Arizona Sun Corridor, an economically important trade region stretching from Nogales to Prescott, including the Tucson and Phoenix metropolitan areas.

Nogales is home to four international ports of entry, including the Morley Pedestrian Port of Entry, Dennis Deconcini Pedestrian and Passenger Vehicle Port of Entry, Union Pacific rail, Nogales International Airport, and the Mariposa Port of Entry. The Nogales-Mariposa Port of Entry has twelve passenger vehicle inspection lanes and eight commercial inspection lanes.

Due to its location on the border and its major ports of entry, Nogales funnels an estimated $30 billion worth of international trade into Arizona and the United States, per year, in fresh produce and manufactured goods from Mexico and the world through the deep sea port in Guaymas, Sonora, Mexico. This trade helps to support tens of thousands of jobs and the overall economies in Ambos Nogales and throughout the American state of Arizona and the Mexican state of Sonora.

The town is named for the black walnut trees which once grew abundantly in the mountain pass between the cities of Nogales, Arizona, and Nogales, Sonora, and can still be found around the town.

==History==


The name &quot;Nogales&quot; is derived from the Spanish word for &#x27;walnut&#x27; or &#x27;walnut tree&#x27;. It refers to the large stands of walnut trees that once stood in the mountain pass where Nogales is located.

Nogales was at the beginning of the 1775–1776 Juan Bautista de Anza Expedition as it entered the present-day U.S. from New Spain, and the town is now on the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail. On the second floor of the 1904 Nogales Courthouse is a small room dedicated to the 1775–1776 Anza Expedition.

In 1841, a land grant from the Mexican government to the Elías family established &quot;Los Nogales de Elías.&quot; Following the Gadsden Purchase in 1853, Nogales became a part of the United States of America. In 1880, Russian-Jewish immigrants Isaac and Jacob Isaacson homesteaded the trading post of Isaacson, Arizona, at present-day Nogales. The U.S. Postal Service opened the Isaacson post office but renamed it as Nogales in 1883.

In 1915, according to historian David Leighton, Sonora Gov. Jose M. Maytorena ordered the construction of an 11-wire fence, separating Nogales, Sonora from Nogales, Arizona, but it was taken down four months later.

On August 27, 1918, a battle between United States Army forces and Mexican militia – mostly civilian in composition – took place. Culminating as the result of a decade&#x27;s worth of tensions originating from the Mexican Revolution and earlier battles in Nogales along the border in 1913 and 1915, the main consequence of the 1918 violence saw the building of the first permanent border wall between Nogales, Arizona, and Nogales, Sonora, along the previously unobstructed boundary line on International Street.

==Economy==
The economy of Nogales is heavily dependent on the cross-border trade through its Ports of Entry by produce distributors and American-based manufacturing plants in Nogales, Sonora and throughout the rest of the Mexican states of Sonora and Sinaloa. Most of Nogales&#x27; economy is based on agribusiness and produce distributors, which comes from large farms in the Mexican agri-belt. Despite its small population, Nogales actually receives much patronage from its bordering sister-city, Nogales, Sonora, Mexico. Most observers guess the population of Nogales, Sonora, at roughly 300,000. International commerce is a big part of Nogales&#x27; economy. More than 60 percent of Nogales&#x27; sales tax comes from the estimated 30,000 Mexican shoppers crossing the border daily. Nogales, Arizona, and Nogales, Sonora, are home to one of the largest maquiladora clusters. This enables American manufacturing plants on both sides of the border to take advantage of favorable wage and operating costs and excellent transportation and distribution networks.

The Consulate-General of Mexico in Nogales is located on 135 W. Cardwell St.

The United States Department of Homeland Security is a major economic driver in the Ambos Nogales region, with thousands of employees working for both the Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection. Due to the large federal, state, and local police presence, Nogales has one of the highest police per-capita levels in the United States.

<text>Patagonia is a town in Santa Cruz County, Arizona, United States. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 913. It developed in the mid-19th century as a trading and supply center for nearby mines and ranches. In the 21st century, it is a tourist destination, retirement community, and arts and crafts center.

==Geography==
The town is located in the valley of Sonoita Creek between the Santa Rita Mountains to the north and the Patagonia Mountains to the south. State Route 82 passes through the town. Nogales lies to the southwest and Sonoita to the northeast.

The former mining camps (now ghost towns) of Harshaw, Duquesne and Lochiel lie to the southeast along the eastern margin of the Patagonia Mountains. The high San Rafael Valley also lies to the southeast. Patagonia Lake State Park, around Patagonia Lake, lies about six miles southwest of the town.

Most of the soils are calcareous silty clay loams (Pima series), with calcareous sandy loam of the Comoro series and noncalcareous sandy loam of the Caralampi series also present.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==History==

The area where Patagonia is located provided Native-American communities, with plentiful hunting and fishing opportunities. Archaeologists have identified the remains of Native American settlements, resource processing sites, and petroglyphs in the area surrounding Patagonia. The area was known as a Tohono O&#x27;odham &quot;ranchería&quot;, or seasonal village, called Sonoitac.

In 1539, Spanish explorer Fray Marcos de Niza entered the area near Lochiel on the Mexican border. He continued on his journey to Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico also known as the Seven Cities of Cibola. Marcos de Niza is credited with being the first European in what is now the State of Arizona. The main Native American tribes in the area at that time were the Sobaipuri and Papago (Tohono O&#x27;odham).

In 1692, Father Eusebio Francisco Kino came to the area as a missionary. His main objective was to convert the natives to Catholicism. The area became part of his Mission Los Santos Ángeles de Guevavi. By 1698, Father Kino encouraged his group to make their way up to Sonoita Creek. When they arrived in Sonoita Creek they encountered groups of indigenous people living along the area in which the creek was located. In the future that area would become known as Patagonia.

According to Gilbert Quiroga, president of the Patagonia Museum, Welsh miners came to this region from Patagonia, a region encompassing the vast southernmost tip of South America, shared by Argentina and Chile, divided by the Andes mountains. The mountains in this area of Arizona, which the Native Americans called Chihuahuillas, reminded the miners of the Andes, and they began calling them the Patagonia Mountains.

The mission period was ended in 1768 by a decree of Charles III of Spain. In 1821, the Mexican War of Independence between Mexico and Spain came to an end and the territory of New Spain, which included Arizona, was ceded to Mexico.

By the mid-1850s prospectors were mining the silver-rich mountains east of Sonoita. By the 1860s vast amounts of silver and lead were retrieved from the Patagonia Mountains each year. In 1854, the United States purchased the region from Mexico in what is known as the Gadsden Purchase. Americans of European descent from the East Coast of the United States began to arrive in the area. They were protected from the constant attacks of the Apaches by the United States Military. However, The majority of the troops were withdrawn from the area upon the outbreak of the American Civil War. Fort Buchanan, a small garrison established in 1856 near Sonoita, was overrun by the Apaches. Thus, the miners, ranchers and farmers in the region were without protection from the Apaches and many of them moved to other areas.

The Civil War between the North (the Union) and the South (the Confederacy) ended in 1865. In 1867, the United States Army established a military post called Camp Crittenden close to Sonoita. The camp, which later was renamed Fort Crittenden, was involved in a campaign against the Apache with the intention of protecting the American pioneers in the area. The miners, ranchers and farmers returned to the area once more.

Rollin Rice Richardson, a veteran of the Civil War, made a fortune in mining. In 1896, Rollin hired J.C. Green, a surveyor from Tucson, to plot the settlement. As a result, he founded the town that same year and in 1899, he applied to open a post office. Richardson wanted the town to be named &quot;Rollin&quot; in his honor, however the residents of the area opposed. They petitioned the United States Post Master General to name the town Patagonia after the nearby mountain. Patagonia was recognized as the official name of the town in 1900 by the United States Postal Office Department in Washington, D.C.

That same year, a two-story railroad depot was built and Patagonia became the commercial center of the mining district in the Santa Cruz County. The ranching and cattle industry also played an important role in the economy of Patagonia. The arrival of the New Mexico and Arizona Railroad to Patagonia gave the ranchers and miners a new outlet for their products and access to manufactured goods.

By 1917, Patagonia had running water, an Opera House, three hotels, a schoolhouse, two parks and several stores and saloons. Richardson practically ruled the town until his death in 1923. Patagonia was formally incorporated in 1948. The railroad was abandoned in 1962.

<doc id="106774" wikidata="Q259729" url="?curid=106774" title="Tubac, Arizona">
<text>Tubac is a census-designated place (CDP) in Santa Cruz County, Arizona, United States. The population was 1,191 at the 2010 census. The place name &quot;Tubac&quot; is an English borrowing from a Hispanicized form of the O&#x27;odham name &quot;Cuwak&quot;, which translates into English as &quot;place of dark water&quot;. When first taken into Spanish speech, it was spelled &quot;Tubaca&quot;. Finally, over time, the latter &quot;a&quot; was dropped. Tubac is situated on the Santa Cruz River.

Tubac was the original Spanish colonial garrison in Arizona. It was depopulated during the O&#x27;odham Uprising in the 18th century. During the 19th century, the area was repopulated by miners, farmers and ranchers, but the town of Tubac is best known today as an artists&#x27; colony.

== History ==
Established in 1752 as a Spanish presidio, the first Spanish colonial garrison in what is now Arizona, Tubac was one of the stops on the Camino Real (the &quot;Royal Road&quot;) from Mexico to the Spanish settlements in California.

Tubac&#x27;s most famous Spanish resident was Juan Bautista de Anza. While stationed at Tubac (1760–1776), de Anza built the chapel of Santa Gertrudis, the foundations of which lie beneath today&#x27;s St. Ann&#x27;s Church.

Apaches attacked the town repeatedly in the 1840s, forcing the Sonoran Mexicans to abandon both Tumacacori and Tubac.

Tubac was the scene of a four-day siege in 1861 among the population of Tubac, Confederate militia, and Apache warriors.

The Confederates won and the Confederate flag used by the headquarters in Richmond was raised. When Union troops then started to approach Tucson, the Confederate troops left Tubac. There the town lay abandoned; grass grew in the streets and the adobe houses crumbled away.

From the 1930s–1960s, Tubac evolved into an art colony. Painter Dale Nichols opened an art school in the small desert village in 1948 and restored some of Tubac&#x27;s historic buildings. Students included watercolorist Al Romo and sculptor Bob Brisley. In 1955, artist Ross Stefan established a studio in the village. In 1961, the Santa Cruz Valley Art Association was formed with 80 members. This group founded the Tubac Festival of the Arts in 1964. Other significant artists in the Village included Sophie and Harwood Steiger, Hal Empie and Hugh Cabot.

<text>Tumacacori () is an unincorporated community in Santa Cruz County, Arizona, United States, which abuts the community of Carmen. Together, the communities constitute the Tumacacori-Carmen census-designated place (CDP). The population of the CDP was 393 at the 2010 census.

==History==

Tumacacori is the site of Mission San José de Tumacácori, a Franciscan mission that was built in the late 18th century. It takes its name from an earlier mission site founded by Father Eusebio Kino in 1691, which is on the east side of the Santa Cruz River, south of the national park. This Kino-period mission was founded at an extant native O&#x27;odham or Sobaipuri settlement and represents the first mission in southern Arizona, but not the first mission in Arizona. The remains of the native settlement are still extant and have been investigated and reported on by archaeologist Deni Seymour.

The later Franciscan mission, which is now a ruin preserved as Tumacácori National Historical Park, was never rebuilt after being abandoned after repeated Apache raids in the 19th century that killed farmers and ranchers in the area and put a stop to the growth of the area&#x27;s economy. Nearby Tubac was besieged in 1861.

<text>Ash Fork is a census-designated place in Yavapai County, Arizona, United States. Its population was 396 at the 2010 U.S. Census, down from 457 in 2000.

==History==
Ash Fork has proclaimed itself &quot;The Flagstone Capital of the World&quot;, due to the large number of stone quarries and stone yards in and around the town. The title of &quot;Flagstone Capital of the World,&quot; was bestowed upon Ash Fork by the Ash Fork Development Association and Ash Fork Historical Society. The title was officially bestowed upon the town in 2014 by the Arizona House of Representatives with the passage of H.R. 2001.

The community was established as a siding of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, later known as the Santa Fe Railroad, in October 1882. It was purportedly named in 1883 by F.W. Smith, general superintendent of the railroad, in reference to a thicket of ash trees at the site. The first official post office was established on April 12, 1883, with one Henry W. Kline serving as the first Postmaster. Following an uncontrollable fire in 1885, the entire town of Ash Fork burned in 1893, and was rebuilt on the opposite side of the railroad tracks from its original location, where it remains today.

In later years, Ash Fork was the location of the Escalante, a large hotel and &quot;Harvey House&quot; built in 1907 and closed in 1948, operated by the Fred Harvey Company. Ash Fork&#x27;s convenient location along the railway and later famous U.S. Route 66 made it recognizable to many cross-country travelers, as evidenced by its fleeting mention in several films from the era of classical Hollywood cinema such as 1947&#x27;s &quot;Dark Passage&quot;, starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall.

U.S. Route 66 provided a slight boost to the town&#x27;s economy in the 1950s, but construction of the divided highway through the town resulted in the destruction of many of the storefronts, sidewalks, and residential streets, forever altering the aesthetic qualities of the downtown area. When the Santa Fe Railroad moved its main line north and away from the town in 1960, Ash Fork lost nearly half its population, as most families employed by the railway were forced to leave the area.

Another large fire, known locally as the &quot;Big Fire&quot;, devastated the community on November 20, 1977, destroying most of the downtown businesses. When I-40 bypassed the town soon after, drastically reducing traffic on Route 66, the local economy never fully recovered. The community&#x27;s last major fire occurred on October 7, 1987, destroying nearly all the remaining buildings along the two-block business district located on the south side of Route 66.

Part of what was once Route 66 still runs directly through Ash Fork, though as a divided highway, with Park Avenue running east and Lewis Avenue running west, both serving as a main thoroughfare. Historic buildings, including a false-front structure and old railroad company houses can be seen along these streets. The majority of the town&#x27;s limited commercial establishments can be found along Park Avenue. The Ash Fork Post Office is also located on this street.

Certain areas of the town were selected to be used as sets in the filming of 1992&#x27;s &quot;Universal Soldier&quot;, supposedly due to the extremely low purchase price and poor condition of several buildings, including an old motel, which were blown up for cinematic effect.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

Geologic places of interest include the Cathedral Caves, which are about west of town off Arizona Road, and Dante&#x27;s Descent, a -deep sinkhole also known as &quot;Devil&#x27;s Hole&quot;, which is around 5 miles northwest of Ash Fork, off Crookton Road. After its closing by the state, however, Dante&#x27;s Descent cannot legally be visited by the public. Pictorial and historic documentation of the natural attraction may be found at the Ash Fork Library.

Ash Fork lies near Kaibab National Forest and Coconino National Forest, and international attractions such as the Grand Canyon are roughly an hour&#x27;s drive away using major roads. Service roads allow swifter access to back areas of Grand Canyon National Park, but may not be open to public thoroughfare.

Approximately to the north of Ash Fork is Beale Road, which has the distinction of being the first federally funded highway. The internationally renowned U.S. Route 66 also runs directly through the town. Notably, the longest original, uninterrupted stretch of Route 66 still in existence (about 9.6 miles (15.4 km) long) can be found between Ash Fork and Seligman, Arizona, beginning just beyond Ash Fork at Crookton Road. The surrounding geographical area and settlements served as inspiration for the 2006 Pixar film &quot;Cars&quot;.

===Climate===
This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 89 °F. According to the Köppen climate classification, Ash Fork has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps.

==Demographics==

Ash Fork (or Ashfork) first appeared on the 1910 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village with 517 residents, the fourth-largest community in Yavapai County (behind Prescott, Jerome, and Humboldt). Although it did not report a separate population for the village, it did report as the Ash Fork precinct in 1920 and 1930 (reporting a majority White population in the latter). The population of Ash Fork was 681in the 1960 census. In 2000, it was made a census-designated place (CDP).

As of the census of 2000, 457 people, 149 households, and 109 families were residing in the CDP. The population density was 199.1 people.sq mi (76.7/km2). The 189 housing units had an average density of 82.3/sq mi (31.7/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 96.3% White, 1.3% Native American, 1.5% from other races, and 0.9% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 51.4% of the population.

Of the 149 households, 35.6% had children under 18 living with them, 54.4% were married couples living together, 6.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.2% were not families. About 22.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.1% had someone living alone who was 65 or older. The average household size was 3.07, and the average family size was 3.45.

In the CDP, the age distribution was 28.7% under 18, 13.6% from 18 to 24, 25.2% from 25 to 44, 21.4% from 45 to 64, and 11.2% who were 65 or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 161.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 143.3 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $30,893, and for a family was $36,875. Males had a median income of $23,854 versus $21,094 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $11,802. About 16.5% of families and 20.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 27.1% of those under age 18 and 18.4% of those age 65 or over.

The numerous flagstone quarries and companies are often cited as the largest employers in the area, as is the local school district, to which most teachers commute from nearby cities.

<doc id="106777" wikidata="Q799863" url="?curid=106777" title="Bagdad, Arizona">
<text>Bagdad is a copper mining community and census-designated place (CDP) in Yavapai County, Arizona, United States, in the western part of the state. It is one of only two remaining company towns in Arizona. The population was 1,876 at the 2010 census, up from 1,578 in 2000.

==Name==
According to legend, the name &quot;Bagdad&quot; is not a misspelling of &quot;Baghdad&quot;. Supposedly a father and son operated a small-scale copper mining operation there in the late 1800s. The father dug out the ore and the son loaded it into bags. When one bag was full he asked his father &quot;Do you have a bag, dad?&quot; However, this is disputed and some say the name derives from the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, imagined as an epitome of wealth and luxury.

==Demographics==

Bagdad first appeared on the 1930 U.S. Census as the Bagdad Precinct of Yavapai County. It was recorded as having a Spanish/Hispanic majority for that census (the census would not separately feature that racial demographic again until 1980). With the combination of all county precincts into 3 districts in 1940, it did not formally appear again until 1960, when it reported as an unincorporated village. In 1980, it was made a census-designated place (CDP).

As of the census of 2010, there were 1,876 people, 682 households, and 485 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 838 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 86.6% White, 0.5% Black or African American, 3.0% Native American, 0.3% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 6.3% from other races, and 3.3% from two or more races. 24.4% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 682 households, out of which 43.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 57.0% were married couples living together, 5.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.9% were non-families. 24.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 3.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.75 and the average family size was 3.29.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 33.1% under the age of 18, 8.6% from 18 to 24, 29.6% from 25 to 44, 24.3% from 45 to 64, and 4.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 30 years. For every 100 females, there were 123.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 119.0 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $58,277, and the median income for a family was $61,850. Males had a median income of $50,000 versus $40,506 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $24,370. About 1.3% of families and 2.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.8% of those under age 18 and 9.5% of those age 65 or over.

==Geography and climate==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

According to the Köppen climate classification system, Bagdad has a typical Arizona semi-arid climate, located on the boundary between &quot;BSh&quot; and &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps.
==Copper mine==
In 1882, prospectors W.J. Pace and J.M. Murphy staked a claim for gold, silver, and lead along Copper Creek. In 1883, John Lawler of Prescott, Arizona paid Pace and Murphy $200 for their claims, but were unable to make a success of it. In 1907, the Giroux Syndicate purchased an option on Lawler&#x27;s claims for $200,000 (), with Edmond Bronson as president. However, the mine was still not able to earn a profit, and operations languished off and on for years. In 1944, the operation was purchased by John C. Lincoln, the builder of the Camelback Inn, who converted the mine entirely from underground operation to open-pit. In 1979, the operation was purchased by AMOCO Minerals, eventually owned by Cyprus Mines.

Cyprus Mines Corporation operated the copper mine until Cyprus merged with Phelps Dodge. Freeport-McMoRan (which acquired Phelps Dodge in 2007) now operates the copper/molybdenum mine. This copper mine does open pit mining and runs on an around-the-clock schedule. The copper concentrate is either trucked to southern Arizona, or taken by semi to 20 miles outside of town to the BNSF Railway&#x27;s Phoenix Subdivision in Hillside.

==Services==

Freeport-McMoRan owns all of the housing and commercial buildings in Bagdad. The town has a main shopping center named Copper Plaza, with a small Bashas&#x27; grocery store and other businesses. Copper Plaza used to have a bank, but Stockmen&#x27;s Bank pulled out due to lack of profits. However, the Arizona State Credit Union and the Bashas&#x27; Associates Federal Credit Union (BAFCU) both installed ATMs inside Bashas&#x27;.

The Bagdad Community Health Center operates a medical clinic. Fry&#x27;s Food and Drug operates a pharmacy in this clinic as well. 

==Education==
Bagdad Unified School District was formed on July 1, 1930. The first graduating class from Bagdad High School was in 1945.

The Bagdad Unified School District #20 consists of a high school, elementary school, and a junior high school. The high school and junior high are merged into one. All of the teachers in the high school and junior high teach every grade level. All schools of this district are now on one campus.

Bagdad High School consists of 7th through 12th grades. Bagdad Elementary School consists of preschool through 6th grades.

The Yavapai County Free Library District operates the Bagdad Library.

==Transportation==
Arizona State Route 96 connects Bagdad with Arizona State Route 97 and Hillside, Arizona.

VVS was founded in 1948 by Hamilton and Barbara Warren. Scholars who helped found the school and guide its early years included Harvard anthropologist Clyde Kluckhohn, anthropologist Margaret Mead, and John Collier, Commissioner of Indian Affairs during the Franklin Roosevelt administration.

Clarkdale, formerly a mining town, is now largely a retirement community and arts community.

==History==
Clarkdale was founded in 1912 as a company smelter town by William A. Clark, for his copper mine in nearby Jerome. Clarkdale was one of the most modern mining towns in the world, including telephone, telegraph, electrical, sewer and spring water services, and was an early example of a planned community. The Clark Mansion, a local landmark, was built in the late 1920s by William Clark III, Clark&#x27;s grandson and heir to the United Verde Copper Company. The structure, east of town across the Verde River near Pecks Lake, was destroyed in 2010 by a fire of &quot;suspicious&quot; origin.

The town center and business district were built in Spanish Colonial style, and feature the Clark Memorial Clubhouse and Memorial Library, both still in use. The Clubhouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The entire original town site is also on the National Register as the Clarkdale Historic District.

The mine and smelter closed in 1953, and Clarkdale entered hard times. Clarkdale was bought and sold by several different companies. In 1957, Clarkdale was incorporated as a town. The 1959 construction of the Phoenix Cement Company (now Salt River Materials Group) plant restored a modest prosperity to the community.

Clarkdale was a segregated town for much of its early history. Mexican and Mexican-American laborers were restricted to living in Patio Town (see neighborhoods), with a separate swimming pool and park; the town swimming pool was marked &quot;whites only.&quot; Additionally, Upper Clarkdale was designated for engineers and executives, while Lower Clarkdale was for the &quot;working class.&quot;

<doc id="106785" wikidata="Q976662" url="?curid=106785" title="Cornville, Arizona">
<text>Cornville is an unincorporated community in Yavapai County, Arizona, United States. The population as of the 2010 United States Census was 3,280, down from 3,335 at the 2000 census. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Cornville as a census-designated place (CDP) that includes the communities of Cornville and Page Springs.

Cornville and Page Springs are rapidly growing suburban areas that serve as bedroom communities for nearby Sedona and Cottonwood. Both communities are located along Oak Creek, a tributary of the Verde River. Lower Oak Creek has been designated an Important Bird Area by the National Audubon Society. Page Springs hosts a large fish hatchery operated by the Arizona Game and Fish Department. Adjacent to the hatchery are creekside hiking trails and bird-watching areas.

Cornville&#x27;s best known resident was U.S. Senator and 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain. McCain&#x27;s home in the community, referred to in the media as his &quot;Sedona Cabin,&quot; is where he and his running-mate, Alaska governor Sarah Palin, prepared for their debates. On August 25, 2018, McCain died in his home in Cornville.

==History==
The Cornville area, particularly above and below the Cornville Bridge on Oak Creek, was well settled by the Sinagua. The Sinagua had disappeared from the abandoned buildings at nearby Montezuma Castle National Monument by the early 15th century. Some Hopi clans claim descent from these Sinagua.

The earliest recorded written history of the area finds it occupied by the Yavapai people. Spanish explorer Antonio de Espejo passed through what is now Cornville on May 7 or 8, 1583, on his way to what would later become Jerome, Arizona. The Yavapai were quite friendly with the explorers, apparently regarding them as supernatural or godlike. Later expeditions over the next 25 years entered the region but with increasing hostility from the Native American peoples which may stem in part from the advent of the Apache and Navajo people in the region. Failure to find mineral resources profitably extractable according to the standards of the day, and the distance from other Spanish settlements caused the Spaniards to cease exploration of the area.

By the time mountain men began to arrive in the late 1820s and settlers began to arrive again in the 1860s the people of the Cornville area were a mixed community of Apache (Dil-ze&#x27;e) and Yavapai (Wipukepaya), though the Apache are thought to have been more numerous on the east side of the Verde River. The area that is now lower Oak Creek was more or less on the border of the area occupied by the Dil-ze&#x27;e Chein-chii-ii (or Red Rock Clan) and Yaa-go-gain (White Land Clan) The US army gathered the Yavapai and Apache people in the area and in 1875 removed them in a tragic and brutal march and exile to the San Carlos Reservation in Eastern Arizona, but many Dilze&#x27;e remained in hiding in the Lower Oak Creek and adjoining White Hills area As late as 1876, numerous Dil-ze&#x27;e still lived on or near Lower Oak Creek.

Relations between settlers and indigenous peoples in the Verde Valley were essentially peaceful from that point on and with the rapid increase in settlers along Oak Creek, although there were &quot;Indian scares&quot; into the 1880s mostly in connection with conflicts elsewhere: In the words of settler W. A. Jordan, in about 1880 &quot;The settlers were in no danger from this band of hunters [that he had just met between Clarkdale and Cornville], but they were so wrought up over the stories of massacres and murders that the Indians themselves were in the greatest danger.&quot; There was resistance among part though not all of the settler population to ending the prohibition on the return or the Dil-ze&#x27;e and Yavapai from San Carlos. Most remaining or Dil-ze&#x27;e and Yavapai lost hope of abiding peacefully and unmolested amidst increasing numbers of settlers and left to join returnees from the San Carlos Reservation in nearby communities in Camp Verde and Clarkdale. They did continue for many years to hunt throughout the valley and to gather food in traditional ways.

The first settlers in the Lower Oak Creek area were Captain Andrew Jackson, a retired Confederate officer from Virginia, and his wife, Margaret, who arrived in the spring of 1876. Several other families including the Dickinsons, Munds, Copples, Pages, Mullhollands and Tiptons had followed by the autumn of that year or the spring of 1877. The settlers quickly built an irrigation ditch serving farms on the west side of Oak Creek.

As to the adoption of the name of &quot;Cornville&quot;, &quot;At a meeting of Verde Valley pioneers, one of them said it was the intention to name it Cohnville, for a family named Cohn that lived there. When the papers came back from Washington, they had read it Cornville, so the settlers accepted the name.&quot;—Letter, L.J. Putsch, early Forest Ranger. However, there was no family name Cohn or Kohn in the Cornville area in 1880 according to the United States Census of 1880. However, there was a Mr. Cone who together with his partner a Mr. Houghton had purchased a proved homestead in what is now Page Springs from Benjamin Coppel in 1878, farmed a year and then rented the property to a family from Arkansas. Both Mr. Cone and Mr. Houghton sold their interests in the ranch to James Page in about 1880. Another theory of the origin of the name of &quot;Cornville&quot; for the town can be deduced from an early settler, James Dunning Tewksbury, who was born in Cornville, Maine in 1823. The Tewksburys were involved in the Pleasant Valley War, a range war in the area now known as Young, Arizona.

The Cornville post office was established May 11, 1887, and Samuel Dickinson was postmaster until 1907. It is likely that he applied for the name &quot;Cornville&quot;. With the Great Depression and a decline in profits from cattle ranching, much of Cornville was reduced to subsistence or near subsistence agriculture in the first half of the 20th century. Some families ranched the surrounding grazing lands while others went to work in the mines and smelters of Jerome, Clarkdale, and Cottonwood. The town remained almost entirely agricultural until the late 1960s, when numbers of retirees and residents who commuted to work in nearby towns began to increase dramatically.

The community of Verde Santa Fe was founded in 1995. It is a home golf-course community in Cornville, along State Route 89A, between Cottonwood and Sedona. The community consists of nearly 1,000 homes in 10 subdivisions.

<text>Dewey–Humboldt is a town in Yavapai County, Arizona, United States. The population of the town was 3,894 according to the 2010 census. The Dewey–Humboldt area was a census-designated place (CDP) at the 2000 census, at which time its population was 3,453.

==Brief history==

Dewey–Humboldt was incorporated on December 20, 2004, from the existing unincorporated towns of Dewey and Humboldt, located adjacent to one another in the Agua Fria River Valley, 15 miles east of Prescott.

After discovery of gold on Lynx Creek in the spring of 1863, the Dewey area was settled around the summer 1863 by pioneer prospector, rancher and politician King Woolsey (1832–1879), who founded the Agua Fria Ranch, in what was then known as &quot;Woolsey Valley,&quot; to supply the miners. Woolsey used stones from decimating prehistoric ruin to build his ranch house, built an irrigation system off the Agua Fria (probably part of a prehistoric system), and introduced some of the first cattle into newly organized Yavapai County (1864). At the &quot;falls&quot; of the Agua Fria at present Humboldt, Woolsey built a small quartz mill to work gold ores from the nearby hills and a small water-powered grist mill. During 1864, he led the storied Woolsey Expeditions to the east in retaliatory raids on Apache and in search of gold; all failed to find a new Eldorado. All these activities caused his bankruptcy, and sale of the ranch property to the Bowers Brothers, sutlers at Fort Whipple. The brothers continued to use the house and farm the lands to supply the region with corn, barley, and other agricultural products. (The ruins of Woolsey&#x27;s ranch house can still be seen between the old Black Canyon Highway and the Agua Fria River about one mile north of Humboldt. The property is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.)

As the valley began to fill up with a few ranches and farms, a post office was established in 1875. The stage station (Prescott to Phoenix wagon road via Black Canyon) and post office nearby was named &quot;Agua Fria.&quot; By the early 1870s water diversions were being used to irrigate an extensive area of corn and other crops. In the mid-1870s a small water-powered, silver-lead furnace, &quot;Agua Fria Furnace,&quot; was built to work the ores from what would become the Iron King mine area. The small plant, built at the site of Woolsey&#x27;s earlier mill at today&#x27;s Humboldt, proved the value of the region, but was too isolated to make a profit.

The isolation of the region came to an end in 1898. The Prescott &amp; Eastern Railroad was built from near Prescott to Mayer (later it was extended all the way to Crown King). The followed along the Agua Fria and built sidings at Cherry Creek Siding (Dewey Post Office), and Val Verde, the site of a smelter built by the Val Verde Smelting Company—a large plant at the site of Humboldt. The Agua Fria post office closed in 1895. When a new post office opened in 1898, the community was renamed Dewey, probably to honor Admiral Dewey&#x27;s great victory that year at the Battle of Manila—this was the height of the Spanish–American War. Another post office was established at Val Verde (Humboldt) in 1899.

In 1902 the Val Verde smelter burnt to the ground. A new company was formed, the Consolidated Arizona Smelting Company, which built a giant smelting plant upon the ashes of the Val Verde works. This operation served not only local mines, but operations throughout the then Arizona Territory. The Val Verde post office was renamed Humboldt in 1905 to honor Baron Alexander von Humboldt, who had visited New Spain early in the 19th century and predicted that greater riches would be found to the north (interpreted by early twentieth century promoters as the Bradshaw Mountains region). Around this time the town of Humboldt began to develop. The smelter and the railroads into the Bradshaws created probably the most widespread mining boom in the county. By 1907 the population had reached 1,000. With two daily trains, business in the town boomed and the city decided to showcase their development by hosting a Labor Day celebration that year. The celebration featuring a parade on Main Street became an annual tradition, now organized by the Agua Fria Chamber of Commerce and held on the last Saturday in September.

The Humboldt smelter operation went through a half decade of reorganization after the Panic of 1907 deflated the local mining boom. Revival came during the high mineral market prices of the World War I era, when the smelting plant operated in conjunction with the Blue Bell Mine, the one productive copper mine in the Bradshaw Mountains. The train connected the mine, located south of Mayer, with the smelter, which kept the town prosperous. Many of Humboldt&#x27;s historic buildings date from the early twentieth century period.

One of the early important mines was the nearby Iron King Mine, but its over promotion in the early 1900s, with the panic of 1907, caused it to close temporarily. It was reopened during the high mineral market prices of World War I. After World War I, a post-war economic down turn caused the smelter and mine to close again. Revival came by the mid-1920s and the local farm and mine economy prospered until the Wall Street crash of 1929 hit. Mines and the smelter closed, and by 1930 the population of Humboldt had dwindled to 300. Humboldt had a second but smaller boom in 1934 when the mine reopened, but its duration of operation would be longer under the Shattuck-Denn company of Bisbee, Arizona fame. The Iron King became the most productive mine in the Bradshaws, and produced $100 million in gold, silver, lead and zinc before its closure in 1968.

The mine tailings are presently being reprocessed into iron-rich Ironite fertilizer. There have been questions raised about the lead and arsenic content of the fertilizer, but the company maintains its product is harmless. &quot;The lead and arsenic are in forms that cannot escape into the environment. You can eat them and they&#x27;ll pass right through you,&quot; said Rob Morgan, Ironite&#x27;s executive vice president and chief operating officer. &quot;They&#x27;re not harmful.&quot; However, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has recently posted a cautionary statement, warning that potentially harmful amounts of arsenic could be released from use of Ironite. Ironite is banned in Canada.

The railroad track, the old Prescott &amp; Eastern line which long before had been taken over by the Santa Fe, was removed in 1971. Today in Humboldt, a lone smelter smokestack, a significant reminder of the region&#x27;s mining history and pioneers&#x27; legacy, remains overlooking the historic buildings on Main Street.

Farming continued in a small portion of the area until 2006 when the last working farm was sold to developers. Today Dewey is a low-density residential area.

It is in the Humboldt Unified School District.

==Landmarks==

King S. Woolsey was a notable American pioneer rancher, Indian-fighter, prospector and politician who had a ranch located right off the Old Black Canyon Highway in what is now the town of Dewey-Humboldt.

Eventually, the land in which his ranch was located was sold and in 1946, became Young&#x27;s Farm, a family-owned farm selling turkeys and pumpkins. Hay rides, pumpkin patches, and a country restaurant made it a popular attraction for city dwellers seeking a taste of farm life. Youngs Farm held a &quot;Pumpkin Fest&quot; every October, drawing large numbers of tourists from other parts of Arizona. After preservation attempts failed, Young&#x27;s Farm was sold to developers, and closed in late 2006. As of mid-2010, the site remains undeveloped, however as of April 2011, Mortimer Family Farms purchased the Young&#x27;s farm and continued to sell sweet corn in the summer and pumpkins in the fall to the public. The ruins of Woolsey&#x27;s ranch are still standing and can be seen from the Old Black Canyon Highway.

<text>Jerome is a town in the Black Hills of Yavapai County in the U.S. state of Arizona. Founded in the late 19th century on Cleopatra Hill overlooking the Verde Valley, Jerome is more than above sea level. It is about north of Phoenix along State Route 89A between Sedona and Prescott. Supported in its heyday by rich copper mines, it was home to more than 10,000 people in the 1920s. As of the 2020 census, its population was 464.

The town owes its existence mainly to two ore bodies that formed about 1.75billion years ago along a ring fault in the caldera of an undersea volcano. Tectonic plate movements, plate collisions, uplift, deposition, erosion, and other geologic processes eventually exposed the tip of one of the ore bodies and pushed the other close to the surface, both near Jerome. In the late 19th century, the United Verde Mine, developed by William A. Clark, extracted ore bearing copper, gold, silver, and other metals from the larger of the two. The United Verde Extension UVX Mine, owned by James Douglas Jr., depended on the other huge deposit. In total, the copper deposits discovered in Jerome&#x27;s vicinity were among the richest ever found.

Jerome made news in 1917 when labor unrest involving the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) led to the expulsion at gunpoint of about 60 IWW members, who were loaded on a cattle car and shipped west. Production at the mines, always subject to fluctuations, boomed during World War I, fell thereafter, rose again, then fell again during and after the Great Depression. As the ore deposits ran out, the mines closed for good in 1953, and the population dwindled to fewer than 100. Efforts to save the town from oblivion succeeded when residents turned to tourism and retail sales. Jerome became a National Historic Landmark in 1967. By the early 21st century, it had art galleries, coffeehouses, restaurants, a state park, and a local museum devoted to mining history.

==Geography==
Jerome is about north of Phoenix and southwest of Flagstaff along Arizona State Route 89A between Sedona to the east and Prescott to the west. The town is in Arizona&#x27;s Black Hills, which trend north–south. The town lies within the Prescott National Forest at an elevation of more than . Woodchute Wilderness is about west of Jerome, and Mingus Mountain, at above sea level, is about south of town. Jerome State Historic Park is in the town itself. Bitter Creek, a tributary of the Verde River, flows intermittently through Jerome. East of Jerome at the base of the hills are the Verde Valley and the communities of Clarkdale and Cottonwood, site of the nearest airport.

==Geology==

Most of Cleopatra Hill, the rock formation upon which Jerome was built, is 1.75billion years old. Created by a massive caldera eruption in Precambrian—elsewhere more narrowly identified as Proterozoic—seas south of what later became northern Arizona, the Cleopatra tuff was then part of a small tectonic plate that was moving toward the proto-North American continent. After the eruption, cold sea water entered Earth&#x27;s crust through cracks caused by the eruption. Heated by rising magma to or more, the water was forced upward again, chemically altering the rocks it encountered and becoming rich in dissolved minerals. When the hot solution emerged from a hydrothermal vent at the bottom of the ocean, its dissolved minerals solidified and fell to the sea floor. The accumulating sulfide deposits from two such vents formed the ore bodies, the United Verde and the UVX, most important to Jerome 1.75billion years later.

These ore bodies formed in different places along a ring fault in the caldera. About 50million years after they were deposited, the tectonic plate of which they were a part collided with another small plate and then with the proto-North American continent. The collisions, which welded the plates to the continent, folded the Cleopatra tuff in such a way that the two ore bodies ended up on opposite sides of a fold called the Jerome anticline.

No record exists for the next 1.2billion years of Jerome&#x27;s geologic history. Evidence from the Grand Canyon, further north in Arizona, suggests that thick layers of sediment may have been laid down atop the ore bodies and later eroded away. The gap in the rock record has been called the Great Unconformity.

About 525million years ago, when northern Arizona was at the bottom of a shallow sea, a thin layer of sediment called the Tapeats Sandstone was deposited over the Cleopatra tuff. Limestones and other sediments accumulated above the sandstone until about 70million years ago when the Laramide Orogeny created new mountains and new faults in the region. One of these faults, the Verde Fault, runs directly under Jerome along the Jerome anticline. Crustal stretching beginning about 15million years ago created Basin and Range topography in central and southern Arizona, caused volcanic activity near Jerome, and induced movement along the Verde Fault. This movement exposed the tip of the United Verde ore body at one place on Cleopatra Hill and moved the UVX ore body to below the surface. Basalt, laid down between 15 and 10million years ago, covers the surface beneath the UVX headframes and Jerome State Historic Park. The basalt, the top layer of the Hickey Formation, caps layers of sedimentary rock.

The natural rock features in and around Jerome were greatly altered by mining. The town is underlain by of mine shafts. These may have contributed to the subsidence that destroyed some of Jerome&#x27;s buildings, which slid slowly downhill during the first half of the 20th century. The United Verde open pit, about deep, is on the edge of town next to Cleopatra Hill. The side of the pit consists of Precambrian gabbro. Mine shafts beneath the pit extend to below the surface.

Attempts to control erosion on Jerome&#x27;s steep hillsides by planting Ailanthus altissima has caused new problems. This invasive species, commonly known as &quot;tree of heaven&quot; or &quot;paradise tree&quot;, has roots that emit poisons that kill native trees and shrubs. The roots can damage sewer lines and septic tanks, and the tree can sprout through asphalt, sidewalks and into structures. In 2015, the Jerome Fire Department hosted workshops on how to control the trees, which are difficult to eradicate.

==History==

===Early===
The Hohokam were the first people known to have lived and farmed near Jerome from 700 to 1125 CE. Later, long before the arrival of Europeans, it is likely that other native peoples mined the United Verde ore body for the colorful copper-bearing minerals malachite and azurite. The top of the ore body was accessible because it was visible on the surface.

The first Europeans to arrive in the area were the Spanish conquistadors. At the time the area was part of &quot;New Mexico&quot;, and the Spaniards often organized silver and gold prospecting expeditions in the area. In 1585, Spanish explorers made note of the ore but did not mine it because their government had sent them to find gold and silver, not copper.
===19th century===
The area became part of Mexico when Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821, and part of the United States by terms of the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which concluded the Mexican–American War. The war&#x27;s major consequence was the Mexican Cession of the northern territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo México to the United States.
Angus McKinnon and Morris A. Ruffner filed the first copper mining claims at this location in 1876. In 1880, Frederick A. Tritle, the governor of the Arizona Territory, and Frederick F. Thomas, a mining engineer from San Francisco, bought these claims from the original owners. In 1883, with the aid of eastern financiers including James A. MacDonald and Eugene Jerome of New York City, they created the United Verde Copper Company. The small adjacent mining camp on Cleopatra Hill was named &quot;Jerome&quot; in honor of Eugene Jerome, who became the company secretary. United Verde built a small smelter at Jerome and constructed wagon roads from it to Prescott, the Verde Valley, and the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad depot at Ash Fork. However, transport by wagon was expensive, and in late 1884 after the price of copper had fallen by 50percent, the company ceased all operations at the site.

Four years later, William A. Clark, who had made a fortune in mining and commercial ventures in Montana, bought the United Verde properties and, among other improvements, enlarged the smelter. He ordered construction of a narrow-gauge railway, the United Verde &amp; Pacific, to Jerome Junction, a railway transfer point to the west. As mining of the ore expanded, Jerome&#x27;s population grew from 250 in 1890 to more than 2,500 by 1900. By then the United Verde Mine had become the leading copper producer in the Arizona Territory, employing about 800 men, and was one of the largest mines in the world. Over its 77-year life (1876 to 1953), this mine produced nearly 33million tons of copper, gold, silver, lead and zinc ore. The metals produced by United Verde and UVX, the other big mine in Jerome, were said to be worth more than $1billion. According to geologists Lon Abbott and Terri Cook, the combined copper deposits of Jerome were among the richest ever found.

Jerome had a post office by 1883. It added a schoolhouse in 1884 and a public library in 1889. After four major fires between 1894 and 1898 destroyed much of the business district and half of the community&#x27;s homes, Jerome was incorporated as a town in 1899. Incorporation made it possible to collect taxes to build a formal fire-fighting system and to establish building codes that prohibited tents and other fire hazards within the town limits. Local merchant and rancher William Munds was the first mayor.

By 1900, Jerome had churches, fraternal organizations, and a downtown with brick buildings, telephone service, and electric lights. Among the thriving businesses were those associated with alcohol, gambling, and prostitution serving a population that was 78percent male. In 1903, New York&#x27;s &quot;The Sun&quot; proclaimed Jerome &quot;the wickedest town in the West&quot;.

===Early 20th century===
Jerome, which was legally separate from United Verde and supported many independent businesses, did not meet the definition of a company town even though it depended for decades largely on a single company. In 1914, a separate company, the United Verde Extension Mining Company (UVX), led by James S. Douglas, Jr. (nicknamed Rawhide Jimmy), discovered a second ore body near Jerome that produced a bonanza. The UVX Mine, also known as the &quot;Little Daisy Mine&quot;, became spectacularly profitable: during 1916 alone, it produced $10million worth of copper, silver and gold, of which $7.4million was profit. This mine eventually produced more than $125million worth of ore and paid more than $50million in dividends. Total production amounted to four million tons, much less than the United Verde total but from uncommonly rich ore averaging more than 10percent copper and in places rising to 45percent.
Starting in 1914, World War I greatly increased demand for copper, and by 1916 the number of companies involved in mining near Jerome reached 22. These companies employed about 3,000 miners in the district. Meanwhile, United Verde was building a large smelter complex and company town, Clarkdale, and a standard gauge railway, the Verde Tunnel and Smelter Railroad, to haul ore from its mine to the new smelter. After the new railway opened in 1915, the company dismantled the Jerome smelter and converted the mine to an open-pit operation by 1919. The switch from underground to open-pit mining stemmed from a series of fires, some burning for decades, in the mine&#x27;s high-sulfur ores. Removing the overburden and pouring a mixture of water, waste ore, and sand into rock fissures helped control the fires. By 1918, UVX also had its own smelter in its own company town near Cottonwood; the company town was named Clemenceau in 1920. In 1929, a company named Verde Central opened what at first appeared to be another &quot;great mine&quot; about a mile southwest of Jerome.

The labor situation in Jerome was complicated. Three separate labor unions—the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers (MMSW), the Industrial Workers of the World or IWW, and the Liga Protectora Latina, which represented about 500 Mexican miners—had members in Jerome. In 1917, two miners&#x27; strikes involving the IWW, which had been organizing strikes elsewhere in Arizona and other states, took place in Jerome. Seen as a threat by business interests as well as other labor unions, the Wobblies, as they were called, were subject nationally to sometimes violent harassment. The MMSW, which in May called a strike against United Verde, regarded the rival IWW with animosity and would not recognize it as legitimate. In response, the IWW members threatened to break the strike. Under pressure, the MMSW voted 467 to 431 to settle for less than they wanted.

In July, the IWW called for a strike against all the mines in the district. In this case, the MMSW voted 470 to 194 &quot;against&quot; striking. Three days later, about 250 armed vigilantes rounded up at least 60 suspected IWW members, loaded them onto a railroad cattle car, and shipped them out of town in what has been called the Jerome Deportation. Nine IWW members, thought by the Prescott sheriff&#x27;s department to be leaders, were arrested and jailed temporarily in Prescott though never charged with a crime; others were taken to Needles, California, then to Kingman, Arizona, where they were released after promising to desist from &quot;further agitation&quot;.

===After 1920===

Following a brief post-war downturn, boom times returned to Jerome in the 1920s. Copper prices rose to 24 cents a pound in 1929, and United Verde and UVX operated at near capacity. Wages rose, consumers spent, and the town&#x27;s businesses—including five automobile dealerships—prospered. United Verde, seeking stable labor relations, added disability and life insurance benefits for its workers and built a baseball field, tennis courts, swimming pools, and a public park in Jerome. Both companies donated to the Jerome Public Library and helped finance projects for the town&#x27;s schools, churches, and hospitals.

In 1930, after the start of the Great Depression, the price of copper fell to 14cents a pound. In response, United Verde began reducing its work force; UVX operated at a loss, and the third big mine, Verde Central, closed completely. The price of copper fell further in 1932 to 5cents a pound, leading to layoffs, temporary shutdowns, and wage reductions in the Verde District. In 1935, the Clark family sold United Verde to Phelps Dodge, and in 1938 UVX went out of business.

Meanwhile, a subsidence problem that had irreparably damaged at least 10 downtown buildings by 1928 worsened through the 1930s. Dozens of buildings, including the post office and jail, were lost as the earth beneath them sank away. Contributing causes were geologic faulting in the area, blast vibrations from the mines, and erosion that may have been exacerbated by vegetation-killing smelter smoke.

Mining continued at a reduced level in the Verde District until 1953, when Phelps Dodge shut down the United Verde Mine and related operations. Jerome&#x27;s population subsequently fell below 100. To prevent the town from disappearing completely, its remaining residents turned to tourism and retail sales. They organized the Jerome Historical Society in 1953 and opened a museum and gift shop.

To encourage tourism, the town&#x27;s leaders sought National Historic Landmark status for Jerome; it was granted by the federal government in 1967. In 1962, James Douglas&#x27;s heirs donated the Douglas mansion, above the UVX mine site, to the State of Arizona, which used it to create Jerome State Historic Park. By sponsoring music festivals, historic-homes tours, celebrations, and races, the community attracted visitors and new businesses, which in the 21st century include art galleries, craft stores, wineries, coffeehouses, and restaurants.

==Climate==
July is typically the warmest month in Jerome, when highs average and lows average . January is coldest, when the high temperatures average and the lows average . The highest recorded temperature through 2005 was in 2003, and the lowest was in 1963. August, averaging about of rain, is the wettest month, while the spring months of April to June generally do not have significant rainfall.

Although most precipitation arrives in the town as rain, snow and fog sometimes occur. On average, about of snow falls in January and lesser amounts in February, March, April, November, and December. Even so, the &quot;average&quot; depth of snow on the ground between 1897 and 2005 was so close to zero that it is reported as zero. Jerome is often windy, especially in spring and fall. Summer thunderstorms can be violent.

According to the Köppen climate classification, Jerome has a Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;).

==Demographics==
The makeup of early Jerome differed greatly from the 21st-century version of the town. The original mining claims were filed by North American ranchers and prospectors, but as the mines were developed, workers of varied ethnic groups and nationalities arrived. Among them were people of Irish, Chinese, Italian, and Slavic origin who came to Jerome in the late 19th century. By the time of World WarI, Mexican nationals were arriving in large numbers, and census figures suggest that in 1930 about 60percent of the town&#x27;s residents were Latino. This statistic is supported by mining company records showing that about 57 percent of the UVX workers were Mexican nationals in 1931 and that foreign-born and Spanish-surnamed workers accounted for about 77percent of the UVX work force.

The ratio of females to males also varied greatly over time in Jerome. Census data from 1900 through 1950 show a gradual rise in the percentage of female residents, who accounted for only 22percent of the population at the turn of the century but about 50percent by mid-century.

As of the census of 2010, Jerome was home to 444 people comprising 253 households, 93 of which were families made up of a householder and one or more people related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. The other 160 were non-family. The residents had a racial makeup that was nearly 94percent White, and the remainder were listed in the census as Black or African American, Native American, Asian, other, or combinations thereof. About 6percent of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. The population, nearly evenly split along gender lines, consisted of 226 women with a median age of 54 and 218 men with a median age of 55.

As of the census of 2020, the population had grown to 464, and the median income for a household in the town was about $35,000. About 19 percent of the population was Hispanic or Latino of any race.


==Government==
Jerome has a mayor–council government. The five seats on the council are filled by public election every two years, and the council member receiving the most votes in that election becomes the mayor. Christina &quot;Alex&quot; Barber is the mayor in 2024, and Jane Moore is the vice mayor.

Yavapai County typically elects Republicans to state and federal offices. About 64percent of its participating voters chose Republican Mitt Romney for president in 2012, and about 63percent chose Republican Donald Trump in 2016. At the state level, Walter Blackman and Bob Thorpe, both Republicans, represent Jerome as part of the Sixth Legislative District of the Arizona Legislature. Republican Sylvia Allen represents the Sixth District in the Arizona Senate. At the federal level, Republican Paul Gosar represents Jerome and the rest of Arizona&#x27;s Fourth Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives. Democrat Mark Kelly and Independent Kyrsten Sinema represent Arizona in the United States Senate.

The town is patrolled by its own police department and is also served by the Eastern Area Command of the Yavapai County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. About two dozen men and women comprise Jerome&#x27;s volunteer fire department, which serves an area of more than including nearby rural and mountainous terrain as well as the town itself. Firefighting, emergency medical service, and wilderness rescues are its specialties. Jerome is in the Verde Valley Precinct of the Yavapai County Justice Court system.

In 2013, Jerome was the third municipality in Arizona to recognize civil unions between same-sex partners, after Bisbee and Tucson.

==Economy and culture==
Jerome&#x27;s economy centers mainly on recreation and tourism. Figures published in 2015 showed that over half the labor force worked in arts, entertainment, retail, food and recreation services, while manufacturing and construction employed just over 10percent. Between 1990 and 2006 the value of taxable sales increased from $4.8million to $15.5million, and between 1990 and 2014 the unemployment rate fell from 4.2to 1.4percent. Formerly vacant buildings house boutiques, gift shops, antique and craft shops; the town also has five art galleries, a library, three parks and two museums, including the Mine Museum run by the Jerome Historical Society, and a former church building that houses the society&#x27;s offices and archives. Annual events include a home tour (&quot;Paso de Casas&quot;) in May, a reunion for former mining families in October, and a Festival of Lights in December. Gulch Radio KZRJ broadcasts from Jerome at 100.5 FM and streams online. The Town of Jerome publishes a bimonthly newsletter, &quot;Point of View&quot;.

==Infrastructure==
===School buildings===

Children from Jerome in kindergarten through eighth grade attend the Clarkdale–Jerome School in Clarkdale. Older students attend Mingus Union High School in Cottonwood. Each of these communities had its own schools during the first half of the 20th century, but declining populations and shrinking tax revenues led to consolidation. The former Jerome High School complex is home in the 21st century to many artists&#x27; galleries.

===Sliding Jail===

In March 2017, the Jerome Historical Society acquired the former jail, now known as the Sliding Jail, from the Town of Jerome. Rendered unusable but not completely destroyed by earth movements since the 1930s, the structure is about downhill from where it was originally built. It has become a popular tourist attraction.

===Utilities===
Jerome manages its own water system, sourced by ten mountain springs. The town&#x27;s annual water report for 2016 assured residents that Jerome&#x27;s water met all state and federal requirements and was safe to drink. Jerome administers its own sewer system, trash collection, and recycling services. Its public works department maintains the equipment and infrastructure associated with these systems as well the water system, streets, parks, and other city property.

Arizona Public Service provides electricity to Jerome, and UniSource Energy Services is the supplier of natural gas. Century Link (DSL), HughesNet (satellite), Speed Connect (fixed wireless), and mobile Web providers offer Internet access. Satellite television is available via DirecTV and the Dish Network. Mobile phone companies and Century Link offer telephone services.

<text>Lake Montezuma is a census-designated place (CDP) in Yavapai County in the U.S. state of Arizona. The population was 5,111 at the 2020 census. The CDP includes the communities of Rimrock and McGuireville. Located along Interstate 17, it is south of Sedona and north of Camp Verde in central Arizona&#x27;s Verde Valley.

==History==
The community was originally known as Beaver Creek as ranchers and farmers settled along the banks of the creek named for the prolific numbers of beavers found there.

Wales Arnold, the first settler along Beaver Creek, came to Beaver Creek in 1870 and lived at what became known as The Montezuma Well Ranch. Arnold, who came to Arizona as a member of the California Column during the Civil War ultimately became the sutler or civilian merchant of the firm Arnold and Bowers at Camp Lincoln following his discharge from the Army at Fort Whipple August 29, 1864. His partner in this enterprise was George Bowers who was killed by Indians near the head of Copper Canyon while en route to Prescott alongside a young soldier named Robert Nix. Arnold held several hay contracts with the Army at Camp Lincoln (renamed Fort Verde in 1868) and grew the first alfalfa known to be grown in the Verde Valley. The Montezuma Well Ranch served as a way station where mail riders changed horses when the mail began to be carried from Fort Whipple to Fort Wingate.

By 1879 there were several children along Beaver Creek and what became Beaver Creek School started when Ed Mulholland began teaching school there then.

The part of the community known as McGuireville began in 1910 when Eugene McGuire settled near the confluence of Dry Beaver Creek and Wet Beaver Creek. This was also at the junction of the historic road from Stoneman Lake which split there with one route going on to Cornville, Cottonwood and Jerome and the other going south to Camp Verde and on to Prescott via Copper Canyon or Cherry. Eugene McGuire along with his son Gene homesteaded there beginning in 1910. Their small store and gas station was supplanted by another store operated by Midge Montgomery who started Beaver Creek Store there in 1931.

The area generally became known as Rimrock in 1928 when Virginia Finnie, the daughter of a prominent local rancher, married Romaine Lowdermilk and the couple along with partner Russell Boardman started a dude ranch originally called Rimrock Lodge later known as Rimrock Dude Ranch. It was so named for the prominent limestone rimrocks forming the edges of the mesas visible from the hill top ranch. Her prominent guests were wanting efficient communications with the outside world so Virginia saw the need to establish a post office on the ranch. Virginia&#x27;s Mother-in-law, Ella Loudermilk, became the first post mistress of the newly established Rimrock Post Office chartered July 11, 1928. People from the Coconino County line near Stoneman Lake, Apache Maid Ranch etc. and up and down the creek nearly to Camp Verde, picked up their mail at the Rimrock Post Office. The former area of Beaver Creek School district thus generally became known as Rimrock. One of Arizona&#x27;s oldest continuously operated landing strips - The Rimrock Airport - is located here as dudes used to fly into the ranch in days gone by.

Around 1957 shortly after the Black Canyon Highway was built north from Phoenix, one of the largest ranches in Rimrock was turned into a subdivision called Lake Montezuma. The developers were planning on selling much of the property to out-of-state buyers and realized they needed something attractive in the name. They dug out a pond below the original ranch house and named it Lake Montezuma after the area&#x27;s most significant local landmark - Montezuma Well National Monument.

The majority of the population of the rapidly growing area soon lived in this one subdivision and virtually all of them were not from the local area. They would identify themselves as being from Lake Montezuma not realizing that they might also be considered a resident of Rimrock and also Beaver Creek. Thus the confusion over the name of the general area.

In the area of the nearby Lawrence Crossing of the Wet Beaver Creek there are artifacts of the ancient Sinagua people, including water catchments for irrigation canals.

<text>Prescott ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Yavapai County, Arizona, United States. As of 2020 Census, the city&#x27;s population was 45,827.

In 1864, Prescott was designated as the capital of the Arizona Territory, replacing the temporary capital of Fort Whipple. The territorial capital was moved to Tucson in 1867. Prescott again became the territorial capital in 1877, until Phoenix became the capital in 1889.

Prescott has a rich history as a frontier gold and silver mining town. Mining and settlers brought frequent conflict with native American tribes in the area, including the Yavapai and Apache. Prescott was the home to Fort Whipple from its inception, which acted as a base for campaigns against natives. Prescott was a stereotypical &quot;wild west&quot; town during the latter half of the 19th century; famous residents included Doc Holliday and Virgil Earp of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. The makeshift wooden town burned to the ground several times in the first decade of the 20th century, which finally resulted in the town being rebuilt in brick. The modern city subsists on tourism, especially around its storied past. It is host to the self-proclaimed &quot;World&#x27;s Oldest Rodeo&quot;, running continuously since 1888. The rodeo, one of the most famous in the United States, draws some 35,000 tourists a year.

The towns of Prescott Valley, east; Chino Valley, north; Dewey-Humboldt, east, and Prescott comprise what is locally known as the &quot;Quad-City&quot; area. This also sometimes refers to central Yavapai County in general, which would include the towns of: Mayer, Paulden, Wilhoit, and Williamson Valley. Combined with these smaller communities, the area had a population of 103,260 . Prescott is the center of the Prescott Metropolitan Area, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as all of Yavapai County.

The Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe reservation is adjacent to and partially within the borders of Prescott.

Prescott is in the Granite Creek watershed and contains the convergence of Miller Creek and Granite Creek on its north side.

==History==

Prescott was originally inhabited by the indigenous Yavapai, who had split off from Patayan groups around 1300 AD. The first recorded European contact with the Yavapai was made by Spaniard Antonio de Espejo in 1583, who was looking for gold. Until the 1860s, there was no permanent European presence. The territory was explored by the Walker Party in 1862 and 1863. Walker and his men discovered gold at Hassayampa Creek, just south of Prescott, in 1863. Further gold was struck at nearby Lynx Creek, Weaver Creek, and Big Bug. With the backing of Ohio railroad magnates, the Arizona Organic Act establishing the Arizona Territory was pushed through in February 1863. The land was now open to settlers. Fort Whipple was established the same year near present day Chino Valley. The fort was also made the territorial capital.

The fort was moved to more mountainous terrain south the next year. Arizona Territorial Governor John Noble Goodwin selected the site of Prescott following his first tour of the new territory. Goodwin replaced Governor John A. Gurley, appointed by Abraham Lincoln, who died before taking office. Downtown streets in Prescott are named in honor of both of them. Goodwin selected a site south of the temporary capital on the east side of Granite Creek near a number of mining camps. The new town was named in honor of historian William H. Prescott during a public meeting on May 30, 1864. Robert W. Groom surveyed the new community, and an initial auction sold 73 lots on June 4, 1864. By July 4, 1864, 232 lots had been sold within the new community. Prescott was incorporated in 1881.

The mineral wealth of Prescott included a good quantity of both gold and silver, and made the hamlet the most important city in northern Arizona. It also escalated the American Indian Wars, as pioneers and natives increasingly attacked the other, in ever bloodier reprisals. Tribes also chose sides against each other, with the Maricopa and O&#x27;odham fighting alongside American and Mexican settlers against the Yavapai and Apache in brutal campaigns. The Hualapai War broke out in northern Arizona in 1865, which brought a period of guerilla warfare, though few pitched battles. Not until 1935 were the Yavapai given a reservation in Prescott, and at first only a mere directly adjacent to Fort Whipple. An extra were provided in 1956.

The mining camps brought much prosperity, but also much racism. On July 12, 1863, the miners of Lynx Creek passed a resolution banning Asian and Mexican miners. Similar resolutions were passed in the other mining districts. Since there was no extant Mexican population, there was little to temper the racism of new Anglos from the Eastern United States. There were also very few women on the frontier at the time; an 1864 census found just 40. 31 were Mexican, which, combined with the racism of the territory, led to frequent allegations of sexual promiscuity. By the 1870s, as Prescott became increasingly &quot;civilized&quot;, it took on the values of Victorian society, including its sexual standards. There were exceptions, however. Mary DeCrow, a white woman, arriving around 1863, had a relationship with a black Texan, breaking taboos around miscegenation. She later married a Mexican blacksmith, starting a boarding house with him; public opinion calmed down after this and she eventually became much loved. Another legendary Prescott woman, Mary Sawyer, wore men&#x27;s clothes, drank hard, swore hard, and worked a mining claim. Sawyer&#x27;s breaking of gender norms however resulted in her 1877 institutionalization in an insane asylum, in which she remained until her death in 1902.

Prescott served as capital of Arizona Territory until November 1, 1867, when the capital was moved to Tucson by act of the 4th Arizona Territorial Legislature. The capital was returned to Prescott in 1877 by the 9th Arizona Territorial Legislature. The capital was finally moved to Phoenix on February 4, 1889, by the 15th Arizona Territorial Legislature. The three Arizona Territory capitals reflected the changes in political influence of different regions of the territory as they grew and developed.

Prescott also holds a place in the larger history of the American southwest. Both Virgil Earp (brother of Wyatt Earp) and Doc Holliday lived in Prescott before their now infamous gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Virgil Earp lived in Prescott starting in 1878 as a constable/watchman. Doc Holliday was there for a while in the summer of 1880 and even appears in the 1880 census records.

Whiskey Row in downtown Prescott boasts many historic buildings, including The Palace, Arizona&#x27;s oldest restaurant and bar. Many other buildings have been converted to boutiques, art galleries, bookstores, and restaurants. Prescott is home to the Arizona Pioneers&#x27; Home. The Home opened during territorial days, February 1, 1911.

After several major fires in the early part of the century, downtown Prescott was rebuilt with brick. The central courthouse plaza, a lawn under huge old elm trees, is a gathering and meeting place. Cultural events and performances take place on many nights in the summer on the plaza.

Barry Goldwater, the 1964 Republican nominee for president, launched his presidential campaign from the steps of Prescott&#x27;s Yavapai County Courthouse.

=== Notable wildfires ===
Yarnell Hill Fire: Nineteen members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, part of the Prescott Fire Department, died on Sunday, June 30, 2013, while battling the wildfire that had ignited two days earlier south of Prescott.

Goodwin Fire: The wildfire ignited in the Bradshaw Mountains south of Prescott on Saturday, June 24, 2017. The fire eventually led to the evacuations of Mayer and Walker a few days later. State Route 69 was partially closed between the towns of Mayer and Dewey-Humboldt.

==Geography==
Prescott is west-northwest of the State of Arizona&#x27;s geographic center.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Prescott is considered part of North Central Arizona, sitting just north of the Bradshaw Mountains and east of the Sierra Prieta range. The Granite Dells, often called ‘The Dells’, lies just north of the Prescott city center and is known for its large boulder outcroppings of granite that have eroded into a spectacular appearance of bumpy rock features. Within &#x27;The Dells&#x27; are Watson and Willow Lakes, which are two small, man-made reservoirs. Here a number of hiking trails connect to the Peavine Trail. The Peavine National Recreation Trail follows what was the former rail bed of the Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix Railway. This railroad traveled from Prescott to Phoenix through the Granite Dells. The &quot;Peavine&quot; got its name from the winding portion of this railroad that twists and curves, resembling the vine on which peas grow. The Peavine trail connects to the Iron King Trail, which was the route of the old Prescott and Eastern Railroad through the Granite Dells. Other lakes include Lynx, Granite Basin and Goldwater, all surrounding different areas of this rustic community. Goldwater Lake, by Goldwater Park, is from downtown Prescott, has of water surface, and is a popular destination for park recreation and picnic facilities. Lynx Lake is another lake close to Prescott in tall ponderosa pines, and gets some 125,000 visitors every year. This lake offers visitors recreational activities, boating, camping, fishing, hiking, mountain biking, picnicking and a small, seasonal restaurant with a view of the lake. Finally, there is the smallest of the natural lakes with of surface water at Granite Basin Lake. None of these lakes permit swimming due to a history of water quality problems, however all are popular recreational destinations near Prescott.

Granite Creek flows generally north from the Bradshaw Mountains through the city, the Granite Dells, and the Little Chino Valley to the Verde River.

===Climate===
Prescott is in the Bradshaw Mountains of central Arizona, at an elevation of . The city has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csa&quot;). However, unlike most other locations in this climate class, there is a pronounced summer wet season due to the North American Monsoon.

Average annual precipitation for 1991-2020 was , with spring and early summer the driest times of the year. Snowfall is typically light and snow cover usually melts away quickly; the average seasonal total was .The largest portion of precipitation falls during the July–September monsoon season. Average daytime temperatures remain above the entire year, but diurnal temperature variation is large throughout the year, averaging nearly annually. On average, temperatures reach on 44 days annually, though + readings are uncommon and occur only 1–2 days per year on average, much unlike the Sonoran Desert to the south and Mojave Desert to the west. The average season for freezing temperatures is October 21 through May 1.

Temperature extremes are fairly widespread. The warmest measured temperature in Prescott is on two separate occasions (1925 and 2021). The coldest low was measured in 1937 and stood at . Due to the large diurnal temperature variation, cold winter days are rare, but being far inland causes a variability which occasionally leads to ice days. The coldest maximum on record is in February 1905 and a normal year between 1991 and 2020 saw the coldest day of the year not rise above . Warm summer nights are rare due to being on an elevated plain, but happen on occasion. The warmest on record is in August 1904, whereas a normal year has a more modest for the highest low.

There was a severe drought from 1999 to 2009, seen from the lack of snowpack in the Bradshaw Mountains. Local creeks do not contain water except immediately after the rare rains. Nevertheless, at the start of 2007 lakes were reported as full. The winter of 2005–06 had less than of snow, compared to an average snowfall of .

=== Monsoon season ===
Prescott is affected each year by the North American Monsoon. Monsoon season is June 15 – Sep 15, and brings significant rain, wind, hail, thunderstorms, and flooding to the area. In spite of the dangers of flash floods and wildfires, many locals enjoy monsoon season for the relief of cooler temperatures, which commonly result from storms during the height of summer heatwaves.

Arizona receives half of its annual rainfall during monsoon season, but this can be misleading. Monthly averages in precipitation can give the false impression that rains are confined to monsoon season, while single-day annual rainfall records have been set far outside of monsoon season, repeatedly. The area is prone to weather extremes and often, monthly rainfall records are actually the result of one or two dramatic rain events.

===Flood risk===
Prescott area residents have faced the challenges of extreme rain and flash flooding since the first prospectors arrived in search of gold in the late 1800s. In 1863 Joseph R. Walker&#x27;s original mining camp on the banks of Lynx Creek was completely swept away in a flash flood less than a year after arriving in Prescott. In the late 1880s, floods destroyed the first dam on Lynx creek near present-day SR-69. 1891 brought the heaviest flooding on record across Arizona (a record broken in 1993), carving lasting changes to the Verde river drainage, bordering Prescott. The Verde, which has in some years been completely dry, gushed with 4,284 cubic meters per second of water on February 24, 1891, or about half the size of the Columbia river.

Tropical Storm Octave, in 1983, brought 14.5&quot; of rain to parts of Prescott in less than forty-eight hours. Damages included the Santa Fe Railway, which was washed out in so many places it was completely abandoned the following year. Two Prescott area college students died in Granite Creek during flooding in 2004, which brought an official state of emergency declaration from state governor Napolitano. Significant flooding has been recorded as recently as 2018, prompting the evacuation of nearby Mayer in August.

A large number of homes in Prescott are located within FEMA designated &quot;high risk flood zones A and AE&quot;. The City of Prescott recently updated Flood Insurance Rate Maps in response to increased construction and notable flooding for several consecutive years.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 33,938 people, 15,098 households, and 8,968 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 17,144 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 92.9% White, 0.5% Black or African American, 1.3% Native American, 0.8% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 2.8% from other races, and 1.6% from two or more races. 8.2% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

The average household size was 2.11 and the average family size was 2.62.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 15.9% under the age of 18, 11.2% from 18 to 24, 18.9% from 25 to 44, 27.3% from 45 to 64, and 26.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 48 years. For every 100 females, there were 96.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 94.3 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $35,446, and the median income for a family was $46,481. Males had a median income of $31,834 versus $22,982 for females. The per capita income for the city was $22,565. About 7.4% of families and 13.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 14.4% of those under age 18 and 6.4% of those age 65 or over.

==Economy==

The Pineridge Marketplace, (formerly the Prescott Gateway Mall) is an enclosed shopping mall that opened in 2002, replacing Ponderosa Plaza, which was Prescott&#x27;s first enclosed mall when it opened in 1980.

Downtown Prescott has dozens of independently owned and operated shops.
Prescott is home to a Pure Wafer silicon foundry.

===Top employers===

Other major area employers include the Yavapai-Prescott Tribe, the James Family Prescott YMCA, and Fann Contracting.

== Places of interest and culture ==

The Sharlot Hall Museum houses much of Prescott&#x27;s territorial history, and the Museum of Indigenous People (formerly the Smoki museum) and Phippen Museum also maintains local collections.&lt;ref name=&quot;PM/pe&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescott has many Victorian style homes. Prescott has 809 buildings on the National Register of Historic Places. The tallest house in North America, Falcon Nest is in Prescott, on the slope of Thumb Butte.

Prescott is home to the downtown historical area known as Whiskey Row. Adjacent to Whiskey Row was the red-light district which operated until 1917, at which point prostitution was outlawed in the state of Arizona. In 1900, a great fire destroyed almost all of the buildings on Whiskey Row, including the 1891 Hotel Burke, advertised as &quot;the only absolutely fireproof building in Prescott&quot;. By legend, the patrons of the various bars simply took their drinks across the street to the Courthouse square and watched it burn. At the time of the fire, patrons removed the entire bar and back-bar of the Palace Restaurant &amp; Saloon to the square by the patrons as the fire approached, re-installing it after the gutted brick structure was rebuilt. Whiskey Row runs north and south on Montezuma St. between Gurley and Goodwin St., directly west of the county courthouse. This single city block has been the home of the St. Michael&#x27;s Hotel (formerly the Hotel Burke) and the Palace Hotel since the late 19th century, along with other colorful purveyors of nightlife. Originally built in 1877, The Palace Restaurant and Saloon was rebuilt after the fire, and is now the state&#x27;s oldest continuous business. Merchant Sam Hill&#x27;s large hardware store was near Whiskey Row.

Prescott is host to the self-proclaimed &quot;World&#x27;s Oldest Rodeo&quot;, running continuously since 1888. Also known as &quot;Frontier Days&quot;, it runs in the days leading up to Fourth of July. It is one of the most famous rodeos in the United States. In the 2010s, it drew over 35,000 tourists a year, nearly doubling Prescott&#x27;s population for the rodeo week. During the same period, some 45,000 people also attend the Rodeo Parade, which winds through downtown Prescott. Though several other rodeos pre-date Prescott&#x27;s by decades, Prescott claims it was the first to charge admission and turn it into a spectator sport. This is backed up by a 1985 trademark on &quot;World&#x27;s Oldest Rodeo&quot;. The rodeo was featured in the 1972 film &quot;Junior Bonner.&quot;

Prescott hosts annual events such as Frontier Days, Easter Egg-Stravaganza, the Bluegrass Festival, Earth Day, July 4 Celebration, Tsunami on the Square, art festivals, a Cinco de Mayo celebration, Navajo Rug Auction, Pumpkin Patch Carnival, World&#x27;s Largest Gingerbread Village at the Prescott Resort &amp; Conference center (on the Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe reservation), Prescott Film Festival, Folk Arts Fair, parades, the Acker Music Festival, The Cowboy Poets Gathering, the Prescott Highland Games, Courthouse Lighting, Whiskey Off Road and Ragnar Relay Del Sol. On New Year&#x27;s Eve, historic Whiskey Row saw the inaugural Prescott Boot Drop to usher in the 2012 New Year. The illuminated tall cowboy boot with multi-colored stars was lowered from the historic Palace Restaurant rooftop&#x27;s flagpole to the delight and cheers of celebrants gathered on Montezuma Street which was closed for the occasion. Also in Prescott is the Heritage Park Zoo.

There are four golf courses within the city limits: Antelope Hills Golf Course, which consist of the City of Prescott South Course and the City of Prescott North Course, Capital Canyon Golf Club (formerly the Hassayampa Golf Club) (private), Talking Rock Golf Club (private), and Prescott Lakes Golf Club (private). More public courses are located nearby in surrounding towns.

Prescott is home to The Arizona Pioneers&#x27; Home, a continuing care retirement home, operated and funded by the State of Arizona, originally intended for impoverished Arizona founders from Territorial days. Initially the home was built to house 40 men, but in 1916 an addition of a women&#x27;s wing was completed to provide for 20 women. Later, in 1929, the home again expanded to include Arizona&#x27;s Hospital for Disabled Miners (current total capacity is 150 beds). Scenes from the 2008 movie &quot;Jolene&quot; were filmed in the Pioneer&#x27;s Home in 2006. The Home has had many colorful residents, including a John Miller, who claimed to be Billy the Kid, and who was exhumed from the Pioneer&#x27;s Home Cemetery in 2005 in an attempt to identify DNA evidence. Another resident was &quot;Big Nose Kate&quot; Elder, who would also be laid to rest in the Pioneer&#x27;s Home Cemetery, though not without controversy.

Prescott is home to Prescott College, a small liberal arts college just west of the downtown area that emphasizes environmental and social justice. It is a non-profit organization which has an undergraduate body of roughly 800 students, and an average student to faculty ratio of 7:1 in on-campus classrooms. There are four general programs at Prescott College: the On-campus Undergraduate Program (RDP), Limited-Residency Undergraduate Degree Program (ADP), the Limited-Residency Master of Arts Program (MAP), and a Limited-Residency PhD program in Sustainability Education. Those enrolled in the Limited-Residency programs work with various mentors and Prescott College faculty, usually in their home communities. On-campus students live in Prescott and attend classes at the college itself.

Prescott was at one point a recovery destination, with over 200 sober living homes dedicated to drug or alcohol recovery. However, increased regulation and enforcement has whittled the number down to less than 30 as of June 2018.

The cultures of Prescott&#x27;s recovery community, the students at Prescott College, and preexisting small town punk subculture have fostered a thriving punk scene. Shows are hosted weekly at house venues, tattoo shops, and bars throughout downtown and the Dexter neighborhood. Prescott has been home to several nationally known punk bands, including Bueno, Life in Pictures, and Hour of the Wolf. Local bands often play shows alongside touring bands, who include Prescott in their tours.

Prescott was the location of Arizona&#x27;s first Elks Lodge (BPOE). In December 1895 a group of enterprising businessmen in Prescott established the Prescott Elks Lodge #330, known as the &quot;Mother Lodge of Arizona&quot;. The Prescott Elks Opera House was built by the lodge in 1905. The Prescott Elks Lodge is in Prescott Valley.

==Government==

The City of Prescott operates under a council-manager form of government. The council has six council members and a mayor, all elected at-large by the people of Prescott. Council members are elected to staggered four-year terms, and the mayor to a two-year term. Elections for mayor and council members are held in the first year after the national presidential and mid-term elections to keep national issues from overshadowing local concerns. Mayoral and council elections are non-partisan. There are no term limits for council members or the mayor. The council appoints a professional city manager to oversee the daily administrative operations of city services and their respective departments, including the Prescott Fire Department. The current city manager is Katie Gregory. The current mayor is Phil Goode, elected in 2021. The current Magistrate is Keith Carson. Council members as of June 2022 are Cathey Rusing, Connie Cantellme, Brandon Montoya (Mayor Pro-Tem), Eric Moore, Steve Sischka, and Clark Tenney.

== History ==

Prescott Valley&#x27;s Fitzmaurice Ruins contain artifacts from the early Mountain Patayan people who inhabited the area some 1,400 years ago.
The Walker Party discovered gold along Lynx Creek in 1863. The Lynx Creek placers went on to produce a recorded of gold. Estimates of actual production range up to , which would be worth about $138 million at 2020 prices.

Prescott Valley, formerly known as Lonesome Valley, was settled by ranchers in the 1880s, raising beef to supply the miners and new settlers. The Fain family, pioneer ranchers, still ranch in the valley.

Thomas Gibson Barlow-Massicks arrived in the area in the early 1890s and built the historic &quot;castle&quot; that still stands in Fain Park. Massicks had a hydraulic gold mining operation in Lynx Creek Canyon and built the company mining camp of Massicks, Arizona just east of his Victorian home, the castle. The fireplace with chimney just inside the castle&#x27;s fence is all that remains of the Massicks store. Massicks accidentally shot himself and died in April 1899 at the age of 37. In the 1930s, there was a gold dredging operation, the Doodle Bug Diggings, farther east in Lynx Creek Canyon.

In the mid-1960s, Prescott Valley Incorporated, a real-estate company from Phoenix, purchased land in an area 10 miles east of Prescott known as Lonesome Valley. In 1966, representatives from Prescott Valley Inc. began traveling to the Midwest to sell home lots.

<text>Seligman () is a census-designated place (CDP) on the northern border of Yavapai County, in northwestern Arizona, United States. The population was 456 at the 2020 census. It is one of the stops on historic U.S. Route 66.

==Geography==
Seligman is located at (35.328199, −112.874303), at in elevation, alongside the Big Chino Wash, in a northern section of Chino Valley. The wash is a major tributary of the Verde River. Seligman is a popular stopping point along Historic U.S. Route 66.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Seligman CDP has a total area of , all land.

==History==
The region was in the longtime homeland of the Havasupai people, who had a settlement in the present day Seligman area. The town site was on Beale&#x27;s Wagon Road, and a stage stop on the Mojave Road

Originally, Seligman was called &quot;Prescott Junction&quot; because it was the railroad stop on the Santa Fe mainline junction with the Prescott and Arizona Central Railway Company feeder line running to Prescott, in the Arizona Territory. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (AT&amp;SF) had reached it in 1882. In 1886 it was renamed Seligman, after Jesse Seligman, one of the founders of J. &amp; W. Seligman &amp; Co. of New York, who helped finance the railroad lines in the area. The original feeder line to Prescott was replaced in 1891 by the Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix Railway with the Santa Fe mainline junction at Ash Fork instead.

Because of its flat land Seligman became a large switching yard consisting of many tracks, and served as a large livestock shipping center for the areas ranchers. It was also a terminal point for changing train crews between Winslow and Needles, who used overnight cottages in the town.

===Havasu Harvey House===
The &quot;Havasu House&quot; was a Fred Harvey Company Harvey House hotel and restaurant in Seligman, serving the Santa Fe Railway and local residents. It was named &quot;Havasu&quot; after the native Havasupai tribe of the area. Adjacent to it was the Santa Fe Depot and Reading Room. The Havasu Harvey House opened in 1905, closed in 1954, and was demolished in 2008.

Passenger trains ceased stopping in Seligman in 1984. The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF) has owned the tracks through town since 1996, which carries numerous freight trains and nonstop Amtrak trains. The former Santa Fe Reading room moved to the Seligman High School.

=== Route 66 – Seligman Commercial Historic District ===
The Seligman Commercial Historic District is a historic district in central Seligman. The historic district is along historic Route 66 in town, which was designated a historic highway by the state of Arizona in 1978. The Seligman Commercial Historic District was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

Seligman was on the original U.S. Route 66 from 1926 through 1978, when Interstate 40 bypassed it a few miles south. Seligman experienced its real heyday after World War II, when returning veterans and other motorists hit the road and made the Southwest a popular tourist destination. The Seligman Commercial Historic District is roughly bounded by 1st and Lamport Sts. and Picacho and Railroad Aves. It was added to National Register of Historic Places on February 1, 2005, reference #04000511. The Seligman Commercial Historic District protects the historical central area&#x27;s early 20th century commercial buildings along Historic Route 66, a revived popular tourist destination. Historic district contributing properties include the Pitts General Merchandise Store and the U.S. Post Office from 1903, the Pioneer Hall and Theatre and the Seligman Garage from 1905, and the Seligman Pool Hall from 1923.

In 1987 Seligman gained its name &quot;Birthplace of Historic Route 66&quot; due to the efforts of Seligman residents, who convinced the State of Arizona to dedicate Route 66 a historic highway. Seligman is the first stop heading west on the longest uninterrupted stretch of historic Route 66, running around to Topock on the east side of the Colorado River. (this claim is about the historical Route 66 and is not to be construed as &quot;the Birthplace of Route 66&quot;. Route 66 was established by the U.S. Congress on November 26, 1926, starting in Chicago, Illinois and ending in Los Angeles, California. The first sign recognizing this designation was posted in Springfield, Missouri on April 30, 1926, and it took over a decade to pave the full route in its entirety.)

===Seligman Depot===

At the western end of the town, directly west of the Roadkill Cafe, is a western town facade labeled &quot;Seligman Depot&quot; It includes 5 storefronts: A Livery, a &quot;Tonsorial Parlor&quot; (dentist), a hotel, a gun shop, and a Wells Fargo bank. There are no actual businesses residing behind the storefronts. Between this &quot;Depot&quot; and the Roadkill Cafe is a log cabin with the word &quot;JAIL&quot; painted in white above the doorway; in front of the cabin is a painted metal sign which declares the cabin to be &quot;1860 Arizona Territorial Jail&quot;. The sign further states: &quot;At one time, held such notorious outlaws like – Seligman Sam – Three Finger Jack – James Younger and many more in 1866 four indians escaped by tunneling from this small cell to the OK saloon. Four days later they were dead after a shootout with Marshal Carl &quot;Curly&quot; Bane&quot;. Behind the &quot;jail&quot; is a corral that holds a buffalo for tourist viewing during the summer months.

The &quot;Seligman Depot&quot; and the &quot;1860 Arizona Territorial Jail&quot; are not authentic historical buildings, but owned by the Roadkill Cafe owners and were built to attract tourists to the Cafe and the attached &quot;OK Saloon&quot;. Note that Arizona Territory did not exist until 1863, and Seligman was not established until 1886 (per the city sign at the edge of town). Marshal Carl &quot;Curly&quot; Bane, the Indian jail escape and the list of outlaws are also fictitious. There are no local or other documents claiming any authenticity to any of the property; visitors are simply left to believe what they wish of the park.

==History==
In the mid-1920s, a road was being built to connect Phoenix and Prescott, by way of Congress and Yarnell. There, a man by the name of Frank Wilhoit built culverts for the road, and then later homesteaded that area with his wife, Christina. The Wilhoit family then built a gas station and garage on one side of the road, and a restaurant on the other. Mr. Wilhoit operated the garage and Mrs. Wilhoit operated the restaurant which remained busy, as foreigners to the town needed a place to eat, and that they also needed an auto-garage considering tires in the 1920s did not hold up well on gravel roads. Mr. and Mrs. Wilhoit would later leave the area and move to Wickenburg around 1930, but the small area retained the name and the area later evolved into a place well known for its mobile homes.

<text>Yarnell is a census-designated place (CDP) in Yavapai County, Arizona, United States. The population of Yarnell was 649 at the 2010 census. Yarnell&#x27;s economy is based on ranching, mining and services to travelers and retirees. Peeples Valley, three miles north, is closely linked to Yarnell.
==History==
Gold was discovered in Yarnell in about 1865 by Charles Genung (1839–1916), a well-known area pioneer. The community is named after Harrison Yarnell, a later prospector, who discovered the Yarnell mine in 1873. Old U.S. Route 89 (now State Route 89), which goes through Yarnell, was paved in 1933, and for many years was the main highway from Phoenix to Wickenburg, Prescott and northern Arizona.

On June 30, 2013, the Yarnell Hill Fire destroyed half of the town and killed 19 firefighters.

==Geography==
Yarnell is located at (34.222569, -112.749608).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

==Attractions==

Yarnell Hill, which Highway 89 descends 1,300 feet in four miles, is a popular scenic drive. There is a developed lookout point at the top – only accessible from the downhill road.

The newest Arizona State Park, Granite Mountain Hotshots Memorial State Park, is just 3 miles south of Yarnell on State Highway 89. It was dedicated in 2016 as a place to remember the 19 Granite Mountain Hotshot Firefighters who were lost on June 30, 2013, while fighting the Yarnell Hill Fire. The hike is approximately 3.5 miles long from the trailhead to the Fatality Site, for a full length of about 7 miles. It is a somewhat difficult hike, with several up and down grades.

Yarnell Hill Fire Memorial Park is located in downtown Yarnell across from the Yarnell Fire Department’s administration building. Several etched metal signs give information about the Fire and about how it affected the citizens of Yarnell and Peeples Valley.

The Shrine of St. Joseph of the Mountains is a Catholic religious monument which features statuary hidden in the boulders. A short trail leads visitors through the stations of the cross.

The ghost towns of Stanton, Octave and Congress are nearby, as well as Harper&#x27;s Flat, the first place on the right (east side of highway) at the top of Yarnell Hill. Harper&#x27;s Flat also contains the old rest area for the highway that was built in 1925 and old mining buildings. The original stage road to the town of Stanton is on this property as well and still visible. A very interesting place to visit, although it is private property, the owners do allow people to drive through and take photos. This property is just south of the Ranch House Restaurant. Rich Hill in Weaver was the richest placer gold discovery in Arizona, discovered in 1863 by a party led by the mountain man Pauline Weaver and the prospector A. H. Peeples. All are popular with amateur prospectors and ghost town buffs.

Other attractions include hiking, UTV riding, gold prospecting, shopping, and restaurants.

Yarnell also includes a small community known as Glen Ilah.

After the 8th grade, Model Creek students move on to Prescott High School of the Prescott Unified School District. Previously Model Creek students could choose between that school and Wickenburg High School of the Wickenburg Unified School District, but in order to reduce taxes, the Yarnell Elementary District board removed the Wickenburg option in November 2018. The Congress district sends high school students to Wickenburg High. Congress district students attended Wickenburg USD for all grade levels prior to 2001, when the Congress K-8 facility opened.

<text>Tacna is a census-designated place (CDP) and colonia in Yuma County, Arizona, United States. The population was 555 at the 2000 census, and 602 as of 2010. It is part of the Yuma Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
By 1859, the Butterfield Overland Mail stagecoach company had opened the Antelope Peak Station at the foot of Antelope Hill. A post office named Tacna was created following the building of the Southern Pacific Railroad in the 1870s, but did not last long. The name Tacna subsequently only referred to a railroad siding serving as a watering station. The town of Tacna was founded by Max B. Noah in the early 1920s, named after the railroad stop. At the time he sold the town in 1941, it contained a post office and a restaurant called Noah&#x27;s Ark. After the town&#x27;s sale, the post office was relocated four miles east, and the original railroad siding was renamed to Noah.

There is an apocryphal story that the name Tacna is derived from &quot;Tachnopolis&quot;, a Greek priest from California who is supposed to have settled amongst the native population. This claim appears to be entirely an invention of Noah.

==Geography==
Tacna is located along Interstate 8 within the Mohawk Valley and just south of the Gila River. It is east of the Yuma Metropolitan Statical Area.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

<text>Yuma is a city in and the county seat of Yuma County, Arizona, United States. The city&#x27;s population was 95,548 at the 2020 census, up from the 2010 census population of 93,064.

Yuma is the principal city of the Yuma, Arizona, Metropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of Yuma County. According to the United States Census Bureau, the 2020 estimated population of the Yuma MSA is 203,247. According to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, Yuma is the &quot;Sunniest City on Earth,&quot; promising &quot;sunshine and warm weather at least 91% of the year.&quot; Anywhere from 70,000 to over 85,000 out-of-state visitors make Yuma their winter residence.

Yuma&#x27;s weather also makes it an agricultural powerhouse, growing over 175 types of crops, the largest of which is lettuce. Yuma County provides 90% of all leafy vegetables grown from November to March in the United States. Yuma is also known for its large military population due to several military bases, including the Marine Corps Air Station.

Yuma is in the state&#x27;s southwestern corner, in the Sonoran Desert, Yuma Desert sub-region.

==History==

The area&#x27;s first settlers for thousands of years were Native American cultures and historic tribes. Their descendants now occupy the Cocopah and Quechan reservations.

In 1540, Spanish colonial expeditions under Hernando de Alarcón and Melchior Díaz visited the area and immediately recognized the natural crossing of the Colorado River as an ideal spot for a city. The Colorado River narrows to slightly under wide in one area. Military expeditions that crossed the Colorado River at the Yuma Crossing include Juan Bautista de Anza (1774), the Mormon Battalion (1848) and the California Column (1862).

During and after the California Gold Rush to the late 1870s, the Yuma Crossing was known for its ferry crossings for the Southern Emigrant Trail. This was considered the gateway to California, as it was one of the few natural spots where travelers could cross the otherwise very wide Colorado River.

===First settlements===

Following the United States establishing Fort Yuma, two towns developed one mile downriver. The one on the California side was called Jaeger City, named after the owner of Jaeger&#x27;s Ferry, which crossed the river there. It was for a time the larger of the two, with the Butterfield Overland Mail office and station, two blacksmiths, a hotel, two stores, and other dwellings.

The other was called Colorado City. Developed on the south side of the river in what is now Arizona by speculator Charles Poston, it was the site of the custom house. When started, it was just north of the border between Mexican-ruled Sonora, Mexico and California. After the Gadsden Purchase by the United States, the town bordered on the Territory of New Mexico. This area was designated as the Territory of Arizona in 1863. The Colorado City site at the time was duly registered in San Diego; both banks of the Colorado River just below its confluence with the Gila were recognized as being within the jurisdiction of California. The county of San Diego collected taxes from there for many years.

From 1853 a smaller settlement, Arizona City, grew up on the high ground across from the fort and was organized under the name of its post office in 1858. It had adobe dwellings, two stores and two saloons. Colorado City and Jaeger City were almost completely destroyed by the Great Flood of 1862 and had to be rebuilt on higher ground. At that time Colorado City became part of Arizona City, later on taking the name Yuma in 1873.

===Early development===

From 1854, Colorado City was the major steamboat stop for traffic up and down the Colorado River. After the 1862 flood, it became part of Arizona City. The steamboats transported passengers and equipment for the various mines and military outposts along the Colorado; Colorado City was the terminus of wagon traffic up the Gila River into New Mexico Territory. They offloaded the cargo from ships at the mouth of the Colorado River at Robinson&#x27;s Landing and from 1864 at Port Isabel. From 1864, the Yuma Quartermaster Depot, today a state historic park, supplied all forts in present-day Arizona, as well as large parts of Colorado and New Mexico. After Arizona became a separate territory, Yuma became the county seat for Yuma County in 1871, replacing La Paz, the first seat.

The Southern Pacific Railroad bridged the river in 1877, and acquired George Alonzo Johnson&#x27;s Colorado Steam Navigation Company, the only steamboat company on the river. Yuma became the new base of navigation on the river, ending the need for Port Isabel, which was abandoned in 1879. The warehouses and shipyard there were moved to Yuma.

==Geography==
Yuma is near the borders of California to the west and Mexico to the south, and just west of the Gila River&#x27;s confluence with the Colorado. The city is approximately from the Gulf of California (Sea of Cortez), a branch of the Pacific.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.07%) is water.

===Climate===
Yuma is noted for its weather extremes. Of any populated place in the contiguous United States, Yuma is the driest, the sunniest, and the least humid, has the lowest frequency of precipitation, and has the highest number of sunny days per year—175—with a daily maximum temperature of or higher.

Yuma features a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;), with extremely hot summers and warm winters. Atmospheric humidity is usually very low, except during what are called &quot;Gulf surges&quot;, when a maritime tropical air mass from the Gulf of California is drawn northward, usually in connection with the summer monsoon or the passage of a tropical storm to the south.

The sun is said to shine during about 90% of the daylight hours, making Yuma one of the sunniest places in the world. The city receives the most recorded mean sunshine of anywhere on Earth, although the equipment used by the United States tends to provide higher sunshine estimates than the traditional Campbell–Stokes recorder.

On average, Yuma receives of rain annually. Even in the wettest year of 2005, only fell. The driest year at Yuma Airport was 2007, with only recorded. On average, the wettest months of the year are during the monsoon months of August and September, and December, when moisture from winter storms arrives from the Pacific Ocean. June is the driest month, with drought virtually absolute.

In 1995, Yuma recorded its all-time high temperature of . The lowest recorded temperature was in the Yuma-Mesa area in January 2007. The temperature fell to for approximately two hours, harming many crops grown in and around Yuma. Citrus suffered the most, particularly the lemon crop. According to an Arizona Department of Agriculture report in February 2007, there was a 75% to 95% loss of crop and trees. On average (according to the 1991-2020 climate period), the temperature reaches freezing point in one year in fifteen, and there are 117 days per year during which the temperature reaches or exceeds , usually from April through October. During July and August, the temperature fails to reach on only one and two days on average, respectively.

In 1997, the desert city sustained a full tropical storm after Hurricane Nora made landfall at the mouth of the Colorado River and quickly moved due north along it. This rare event cut power to 12,000 customers in Yuma, and dropped of rain at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma. The last time a hurricane had hit near Yuma was in mid-August 1977, when similar rainfalls were recorded.

Snow in Yuma has only been recorded on December 12, 1932, when a light coating of snow covered the city for the first and only time in its history. A few flakes fell in January 1937 and December 1967, mixed with rain.

<text>DeWitt is the second largest city in Arkansas County, Arkansas, United States, which also serves as the county seat of the southern district of Arkansas County. Population was 3,292 at the time of the 2010 census. The city is located on the Arkansas Grand Prairie, known for rice farming and duck hunting. DeWitt is home to the DeWitt School District and the DeWitt Municipal Airport.

==History==
The Arkansas County Quorum Court determined Arkansas Post, which had served as county seat since 1813, was no longer centrally located within the county following creation of several Southeast Arkansas counties. A new, more centrally located town was proposed to become county seat. Founded February 19, 1853, the name DeWitt was after being submitted by an admirer of the sixth governor of New York, DeWitt Clinton, one of many localities named for Clinton during the period. The town was platted in 1854, and has had a post office since 1856. The city was incorporated in 1875.

== Geography ==
DeWitt and Arkansas County are located in the Arkansas Delta (in Arkansas, usually referred to as &quot;the Delta&quot;) a subregion of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain, which is a flat area consisting of rich, fertile sediment deposits from the Mississippi River between Louisiana and Illinois.

Within the Delta, Arkansas County is almost entirely within the Grand Prairie subregion, historically a flat grassland plain underlain by an impermeable clay layer (the Stuttgart soil series). Prior to the 19th century, flatter areas with slowly to very slowly permeable soils (often containing fragipans) supported Arkansas&#x27;s largest prairie, covered in prairie grasses and forbs, with oaks covering the low hills and ridges, and pockets of floodplains with bottomland hardwood forests. This region was a sharp contrast to the bottomland forests that once dominated other parts of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain. Cropland has now largely replaced the native vegetation. Distinctively, rice is the main crop; soybeans, cotton, corn, and wheat are also grown. The rice fields provide habitat and forage for large numbers and many species of waterfowl; duck and goose hunting occurs at this important spot along the Mississippi Flyway.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.
