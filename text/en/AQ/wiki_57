<text>Champaign ( ) is a city in Champaign County, Illinois, United States. The population was 88,302 at the 2020 census. It is the tenth-most populous municipality in Illinois and the fourth most populous city in the state outside the Chicago metropolitan area. It is a principal city of the Champaign–Urbana metropolitan area, which had 236,000 residents in 2020.

Champaign shares the main campus of the University of Illinois with its twin city of Urbana, and is also home to Parkland College, which gives the city a large student population during the academic year. Due to the university and a number of technology startup companies, it is often referred to as a hub of the Illinois Silicon Prairie. Champaign houses offices for the Fortune 500 companies Abbott, Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Caterpillar, John Deere, Dow Chemical Company, IBM, and State Farm. Champaign also serves as the headquarters for several companies, including Jimmy John&#x27;s.

==History==
Champaign was founded in 1855, when the Illinois Central Railroad laid its rail track two miles (3 km) west of downtown Urbana. Originally called &quot;West Urbana&quot;, it was renamed Champaign when it acquired a city charter in 1860. Both the city and county name were derived from Champaign County, Ohio, which took its name from the French word for &quot;open, level country&quot;.

During February 1969, Carl Perkins joined with Bob Dylan to write the song &quot;Champaign, Illinois&quot;, which Perkins released on his album &quot;On Top&quot;. The band Old 97&#x27;s took another Bob Dylan song, &quot;Desolation Row&quot;, and combined its melody with new lyrics to make a new song &quot;Champaign, Illinois&quot;, which they released with Dylan&#x27;s blessing on their 2010 album &quot;The Grand Theatre Volume One&quot;. It achieved considerable popularity. The two &quot;Champaign, Illinois&quot; songs are not similar to each other, except that Bob Dylan was involved in both of them.

On September 22, 1985, Champaign hosted the first Farm Aid concert at the University of Illinois&#x27; Memorial Stadium. The concert drew a crowd of 80,000 people and raised over $7 million for American family farmers.

In 2005, Champaign–Urbana (specifically the University of Illinois) was the location of the National Science Olympiad Tournament, attracting young scientists from all 50 states. The city also hosts the state Science Olympiad competition every year. The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign once again hosted the National competition on May 20–22, 2010.

Joan Severns was the city&#x27;s first female mayor, serving between 1979 and 1983. Deborah Frank Feinen, who has served as mayor since 2015, is the city&#x27;s second female mayor. In May 2017, the city&#x27;s first female-majority city council was sworn in.

===Landmarks and districts===

====Downtown====

In the 1980s, part of the downtown Champaign area (Neil St.) was closed to vehicular traffic to create a pedestrian mall, but this short-lived experiment was scrapped when business declined. As part of a revitalization effort, One Main Development constructed two new mixed-use buildings: One Main and M2 on Neil. The City of Champaign gave $3.7 million in tax incentives for the building of M2 and agreed to pay nearly $11 million for a new parking deck.

This growth in downtown Champaign coincided with the larger growth of the &quot;north Prospect&quot; shopping district on the city&#x27;s northern boundary. The growth in the north Prospect area relied, in part, on leapfrogging, moving out to the countryside and developing more remote farmland that eventually connects to the main development. Given the overwhelming success of such suburban shopping areas nationally, new development within any city center represented an alternative to the dominant movement out and away from the cities.

The Champaign City Building serves as the City Hall and is a recognizable landmark. The building replaces the original city building, which sat on the same site until 1937.
The historic Virginia Theatre is a restored 1463-seat movie theater which opened on December 28, 1921. It has an ornate, Spanish Renaissance-influenced interior, full stage and dressing rooms, and its original Wurlitzer pipe organ. It hosts Ebertfest and has a single 56&#x27; x 23&#x27; screen. The theater does not have a daily show schedule, but schedules special screenings and live performances several times each month.

The Art Theater Co-op, which showed independent and foreign films, was built in 1913 as the Park Theatre. From 1969 to 1986, it showed adult films. Until October 2019, it was the only single-screen movie theater operating daily in Champaign-Urbana, and was the United States&#x27;s first co-operatively owned art movie theater. It closed in October 2019.

====Campustown====

Located along Green Street, this commercial district serves as the entertainment and retail center for students at the University of Illinois and citizens of the Champaign–Urbana metropolitan area. This area has been undergoing change since 2002 with the completion of a new $7 million streetscape project. Campustown is now attracting new retail and entertainment stores as well as serving as the center for new construction projects. Several new projects opened in 2008 including the 18-story Burnham 310 high-rise and grocery store at 4th and Springfield, and a new 24-story apartment building called 309 Green.

The newly renamed Tower at 3rd (formerly Champaign Hilton, Century 21, Quality Inn, University Inn, Presidential Tower) is located in the University District and is over twenty stories high. A hotel until 2001, it currently houses student apartments.

A new 14-story apartment complex was completed in 2014 at the intersection of 6th and Green streets (site of the former Gameday Spirit). A 12-story, mixed-use complex consisting of a hotel, apartments and parking was scheduled to be completed by August 2015. The mixed-use complex is reported to consist of two towers which will be connected by a skywalk. A 27-story apartment building is planned at 308 East Green Street. This high-rise is reported to have an automated parking vault which will be operated by an elevator.

The Clippers played for one season in the Illinois–Indiana League before folding. The city hosted its second team, the Champaign-Urbana Velvets from 1911 to 1914 who played in the Illinois–Missouri League until the league disbanded after 1914.

<text>Homer is a village in Champaign County, Illinois, United States. Its population was 1,073 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Homer grew from a settlement named Union, which was on the Fort Clark or State Road running between Danville and Urbana, nearly three miles north of the present town. Union was little more than several cabins built in 1829-30, but it served as a post office and meeting place in what was Vermilion County prior to the creation of Champaign County in 1833. Moses Thomas, a native of Pennsylvania, built a mill on the Salt Fork creek southeast of Union in 1834 and began to mill grain. A young merchant traveling from Indiana, Michael Doctor Coffeen, built a store adjacent to the mill, and with Thomas created the village of Homer on January 26, 1837. The post office was moved to Homer with M. D. Coffeen as postmaster in 1841.

Homer grew to 120 people in 1850, and the coming of the Great Western Railroad to the south of the town prompted the village to move to its present location. In February 1855, the town&#x27;s 32 buildings were dragged 1.5 miles south by 18 teams of oxen. The village became a stop on the railway, later named the Wabash Railroad, becoming the center of agriculture in eastern Champaign County.

In 1905, the town became the location for Homer Park, an amusement park on the Illinois Traction System interurban line. Homer Park, north of the village on the Salt Fork creek, offered swimming, food, baseball, movies and even a small zoo. The park closed in 1937 after flooding and poor management.

===Teachers strike===
The Homer School District, which served the village and the surrounding area, set a record for the longest teacher&#x27;s strike in the nation&#x27;s history, spanning from October 26, 1986, to June 23, 1987. At 156 days, the strike was more than twice as long as the second-longest, set by a school district near Cleveland, Ohio during the 2002-2003 school year. At issue throughout the negotiations was the salary formula, which the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported was &quot;not likely to drastically change the pay rates of ... teachers.&quot; Other provisions included allowing teachers fired during the strike to be allowed to return with no loss of salary or seniority and the district&#x27;s newly unionized support staff getting a 6 percent pay increase beginning July 1, and an additional 2 percent increase at the beginning of the 1988-1989 school year. Legal fees were estimated to be $150,000.

Although the strike lasted 156 days, students only lost 11 days of class time as strikebreaking teachers were hired to teach classes. However, some families moved from Homer or paid tuition to have their children attend neighboring schools. The Homer School District eventually consolidated with the Allerton-Broadlands-Longview School District (located to Homer&#x27;s south), many of the teachers left and all but two school board members either did not seek re-election or were defeated in the first election after the settlement. The town suffered from the effects of the strike for many years, according to a 2006 article in &quot;The News Gazette&quot; of Champaign-Urbana.

<text>Ludlow is a village in Champaign County, Illinois, United States. The population was 308 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Once named Pera Station, Ludlow, a prairie town in northern Champaign County, Illinois, has a rich history dating back to its days as a stop on the Illinois Central Railroad. This settlement played a crucial role in connecting the region&#x27;s rural communities and facilitating trade between Urbana and Loda. The village was renamed &quot;Ludlow&quot; in 1868 after James D. Ludlow, a shareholder in the Illinois Central Railroad. The construction of the railroad brought about a significant influx of settlers to Ludlow, many were attracted by the area&#x27;s fertile soil and vast prairies. The early years saw rapid growth, with James Ludlow donating land to the village for its expansion. The village grew to include two churches, becoming a hub for community gatherings and worship. The village continued to expand including a hardware store, as well as two blacksmith shops were established. Additionally, the &quot;Ludlow Co-Op Elevator Company&quot; was formed in 1904, the company has continued to serve the community and has since grown, expanding to 11 locations.

In 1949, a fire department was formed to service the residents of Ludlow, known as “Ludlow Fire Protection District&quot;. In the late 1970&#x27;s, Ludlow received significant funding after an arson attack. This funding assisted in critical infrastructure upgrades, which had a lasting impact on the town&#x27;s development and growth. The funds were used to renovate roads, upgrade drainage systems, and install curbs, among other projects including, building a new community center. Ludlow continues to grow and evolve, with police services and a local post office.

<doc id="110881" wikidata="Q2127663" url="?curid=110881" title="Mahomet, Illinois">
<text>Mahomet is a village in Champaign County, Illinois, United States, along the Sangamon River. The population was 9,434 at the 2020 census. Mahomet is located approximately northwest of Champaign at the junction of Interstate 74 and Illinois Route 47.

==Etymology==
The town&#x27;s own published account credits their founder Daniel T. Porter, who had Connecticut roots, as the one who denominated both the new village as Middletown (after Middletown, Connecticut) and the post office as Mahomet (after Mahomet Weyonomon, a Mohegan sachem from Connecticut). With the arrival of the railroad, the town embraced the name of its post office in 1871 because there already was a Middletown, Illinois. However, alternative theories of the origin of the name &quot;Mahomet&quot; also exist. One derives the word from the &quot;Mahomet Lodge,&quot; the local Masonic Lodge at the time the town was searching for a new name. Its use as the name of the lodge was a manifestation of the Freemasons&#x27; liberal use of religious names and stonemason tools and symbols. Local historian, Gregory Pasley, claims the Post Office held the name of &quot;Mahomet&quot; by 1838 and says this was before the Masonic Lodge was established in the village. Another theory stated that the town&#x27;s name was arbitrarily assigned when the conflicting names were noted by the US Postal Service. Henry Gannett&#x27;s book, &quot;The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States&quot;, proposes Muhammad as the town&#x27;s namesake.

==History==
The village of Mahomet was first settled in 1832 on the banks of the Sangamon River. It was the first community to be established in modern-day Champaign County. The original village name was Middletown, possibly because it is half-way between the towns of Danville and Bloomington. In 1871, the name of the village was changed to Mahomet because there was already another Middletown in Illinois, which was causing mail problems. Most early settlers came from Ohio, Virginia, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania and chose to reside in Mahomet because there was abundant water from the Sangamon River and abundant trees. Currently, most residents commute around to the cities of Champaign and Urbana to work, although the village has a thriving small business district.

In 2007, the citizens of Mahomet voted to repeal the alcohol prohibition order that had been in place since World War II.

When the 1996 tornado was over, more than 200 homes received major damage, 80 homes were completely destroyed and 13 people suffered minor injuries. With help from government agencies, surrounding communities, and thousands of volunteers; Ogden recovered under the leadership of Mayor Jim Gilliland. Over the years Ogden has proven itself a resilient community with supportive and caring residents.

The Kickapoo Rail Trail(KRT) runs through Ogden and when completed will be part of the Trail running from Urbana to Danville.

In 2022, Ogden area citizens formed a village volunteer group called Onward Ogden that is running many events and an Ogden Open Air Market every Thursday Memorial Day to Labor Day and has taken an active interest in the village. Onward Ogden&#x27; Park and Recreation group has been very active in creating more inviting spaces and helping maintain the village&#x27;s parks and play grounds. There are numerous bird houses assembled and painted by area students that are hung throughout the village.

<text>Rantoul is a village in northern Champaign County, Illinois, United States. The population was 12,371 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Champaign–Urbana metropolitan area.

==History==

The community was named after Robert Rantoul, Jr., a U.S. representative from Massachusetts, and a director of the Illinois Central Railroad.

Rantoul was laid out in 1854 for the Illinois Central Railroad by John Penfield. A post office was established in 1856 as Rantoul Station; the name was changed to Rantoul in May 1862.

In 1917, Rantoul was chosen by the United States Army to be the site of Chanute Field, due to its proximity to the Illinois Central railroad and the War Department&#x27;s ground school at the University of Illinois. In the 1930s, Chanute Field grew, dominating the local economy as thousands of airmen were stationed there to train recruits. Renamed Chanute Air Force Base after World War II, it was closed in 1993, but was partly reoccupied by the Octave Chanute Aerospace Museum, which was permanently closed on December 30, 2015, and the Rantoul National Aviation Center. Rantoul&#x27;s economy has taken a sharp decline due to the base&#x27;s closing, from which it has never recovered. The book &quot;Eye of the Storm: Chanute Closes&quot; by Katy B. Podagrosi tells the story of this period.

Rantoul Family Sports Complex opened in August 2021 as a premier amateur sports facility featuring 10 all weather baseball / softball and 8 all weather multi-purpose fields. The complex plays host to thousands of amateur teams for tournament and local play. It also serves as home field for the University of Illinois &quot;Fighting Illini&quot; men&#x27;s lacrosse team.

In 2022 the Rantoul Family Sports Complex was visited by nearly 1 million people, resulting in 7.5 million dollars in visitor spending in Champaign County.

==Geography==

==History==

Royal, Illinois is a small village that in part consists of grain elevators at the intersection of a railroad and County Road 20.

Nearly a hundred years ago, the people of St. John Lutheran Church decided to move their church building into town, to better serve current and future generations of people in the village of Royal. Not everyone initially wanted to move the church building; the vote to move was narrowly split. Nonetheless, having made the decision, the congregation came together and embraced the vision for a ministry within the village of Royal. The people worked together for many hours to move their church home. The men and boys of the congregation carefully deconstructed the church, brick by brick, and transported the bricks from out in the country into the village of Royal. There, the congregation&#x27;s women and older men painstakingly cleaned the mortar from the bricks to provide the building blocks for a new St. John Lutheran Church to serve the people of Royal. The church still stands today, with 831 members and an average attendance of 200 people.

In 1982, around the time of the town&#x27;s centennial anniversary, people began to talk to one another about constructing a shared Community Building to benefit the current and future people of Royal. Hearkening back to the example of the members of St. John&#x27;s, the wider community came together around the shared vision of a community of people living together. This vision was embodied in the concept of a Community Building.

An apartment building in Champaign, Illinois needed to be demolished. Hearkening back to the example of the people of St. John Lutheran, the people gathered the bricks and worked together to clean the mortar from each brick. The people then built the new Community Building with these bricks, and it was completed the year after the centennial. The building still stands today and is used by the people of Royal for personal and public events for as little as $85.00 for a small group.

== History ==


Founded in the early 19th century as a result of the land-grant Illinois Central Railroad&#x27;s expansion southward, Tolono was initially home to many railroad employees. Many streets bear the names of the IC&#x27;s administrative staff. The original homes in the community were small and narrow filling half lots adjacent to the railroad tracks. With the intersection of an east-west railway, Tolono became a featured stop for early rail passengers. The peak of the railroad&#x27;s passenger influence in Tolono occurred when Tolono became the last stop in Illinois for Abraham Lincoln as he bid farewell to his home state in a speech given from the back of his coach.

In 1959, Tolono became home to the first Monical&#x27;s Pizza restaurant. Although the original location does not bear the Monical&#x27;s name any longer, the buildings still stand and another Monical&#x27;s Pizza is operated less than a block away. Members of the entrepreneurial Monical family still reside in the village today.

After shooting in several locations in Tolono in 2006, Mark Roberts, a Tolono native, wrapped production on his feature-length movie &quot;Welcome To Tolono&quot;. The film was highlighted on the 2007 film festival circuit. &quot;Welcome To Tolono&quot; focuses on an Alcoholics Anonymous group that meets in the basement of a Tolono church.

* George Washington Burr, Major General during World War I
* Mark Roberts, screenwriter, playwright, producer, actor, and comedian; best known for creating the American sitcom &quot;Mike &amp; Molly&quot;
* Rocky Ryan, NFL player with the Philadelphia Eagles and Chicago Bears

<text>Urbana ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Champaign County, Illinois, United States. As of the 2020 census, Urbana had a population of 38,336. It is a principal city of the Champaign–Urbana metropolitan area, which had 236,000 residents in 2020.

Urbana is notable for sharing the main campus of the University of Illinois with its twin city of Champaign.

==History==
The Urbana area was first settled by Europeans in 1822, when it was called &quot;Big Grove&quot;. When the county of Champaign was organized in 1833, the county seat was located on 40 acres of land, 20 acres donated by William T. Webber and 20 acres by M. W. Busey, considered to be the city&#x27;s founder, and the name &quot;Urbana&quot; was adopted after Urbana, Ohio, the hometown of State Senator John W. Vance, who authored the Enabling Act creating Champaign County. The creation of the new town was celebrated for the first time on July 4, 1833.

Stores began opening in 1834. The first mills were founded in -50. The town&#x27;s first church, the Methodist Episcopal Church, and the parsonage, was built in 1840 by the Rev. A. Bradshaw, with the Baptist Church following in 1855. The Presbyterian Church was founded in 1856. The city&#x27;s first school was built in 1854.

Urbana suffered a setback when the Chicago branch of the Illinois Central Railroad, which had been expected to pass through town, was instead laid down two miles west, where the land was flatter. The town of West Urbana grew up around the train depot built there in 1854; further, in 1861 its name was changed to Champaign. The competition between the two cities provoked Urbana to tear down the ten-year-old County Courthouse and replace it with a much larger and fancier structure, to ensure that the county seat would remain in Urbana.

Champaign-Urbana was selected as the site for a new state agricultural school, thanks to the efforts of Clark Griggs. Illinois Industrial University, which would evolve into the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, opened in 1868 with 77 students.

A number of efforts to merge Urbana and Champaign have failed at the polls.

On October 9, 1871, a fire burned much of downtown Urbana. Children playing with matches started the fire. (It is unrelated to the Great Chicago Fire that started the day before, though both fires occurred during severe drought and were spread by high winds.)

==Geography==
According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Urbana has a total area of , of which (or 99.40%) is land and (or 0.60%) is water.

Urbana borders the city of Champaign. The main campus of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is situated on this border. Together, these two cities are often referred to as &quot;Urbana-Champaign&quot; (the designation used by the university) or &quot;Champaign-Urbana&quot; (the more common usage, due to the larger size of Champaign). With the nearby village of Savoy, they form the Champaign–Urbana metropolitan area.

Candlestick Lane is the name of a neighborhood in eastern Urbana. This neighborhood consists of Grant Place and adjacent properties on Fairlawn and Eastern Drives. It is called Candlestick Lane because every year the residents decorate their yards for Christmas with a lot of lights and figures. The tradition began in 1961 (maybe 1960) as a house-decorating contest sponsored by the Illinois Power Company. The neighborhood used its prize money to purchase electric candlesticks for each home. The City of Urbana installs special red and green street signs, reading &quot;Candlestick Lane&quot; and &quot;Grant Place&quot; during the Holiday season. The lights are turned on from around 5:00 to 10:00 p.m. from the third Saturday in December through New Years Day.

===Market at the Square===

The Market at the Square, also known as the Farmers&#x27; Market, has been a community event in Urbana since 1979. Every Saturday morning from some time in May to some time in November, dozens of vendors set up shop in the Lincoln Square parking lot in downtown Urbana. They primarily sell local produce (including corn, tomatoes, lettuce and watermelons), but one can also find local crafts, music, kettle corn and booths for various community and political organizations.

===Urbana Sweetcorn Festival===
The Urbana Sweetcorn Festival is an annual festival in Urbana. It was first held in August 1975 in the Busey Bank parking lot in downtown Urbana. It was a community event put on by employees of Busey Bank. Since then the Sweetcorn Festival has continued to grow. The Urbana Business Association is now responsible for the planning of the festival, over the years adding a local car show, an expanded family area, live music on multiple stages, food, vendors, beer, in the heart of downtown Urbana.

In addition to corn and beverages, the festival has offered a range of activities and events, including a display of antique and other collectors&#x27; cars and volksmarches, arts events, a dog show, and a book sale organized by the Friends of the Urbana Free Library.

===Urbana Lincoln Hotel===
The Urbana Lincoln Hotel is connected to Lincoln Square Mall, an indoor walking mall, in the center of Urbana. The hotel was designed by famed Urbana architect Joseph Royer in 1923 and opened several rooms on November 1, 1923, to accommodate guests for the university&#x27;s Homecoming game. The original building was built in the Tudor Revival style. A convention center was added in the 1970s in the Bavarian style. While being forced to close twice between 1990 and 2009, the hotel was purchased by a private developer in 2010 and underwent major rehabilitation. The hotel opened under new management and with a new name, Urbana Landmark Hotel, on December 1, 2012, but it closed in July 2015 and sold January 2020 for redevelopment as a Hilton Tapestry hotel.

==Parks and recreation==

Carle Park, established in 1909, is located at Indiana and Garfield, just west of Urbana High School in central Urbana. Measuring , it contains a statue entitled &quot;Lincoln the Lawyer&quot; by Lorado Taft and more than 50 well-established trees that are part of the Hickman Tree Walk. The Lincoln statue was previously sited in front of the Urbana Lincoln Hotel, but was moved after only a few months.

Meadowbrook Park is located southeast of the Race Street and Windsor Road intersection. The park covers , including 80 of recreated Illinois tallgrass prairie. Around the prairie restoration center of the park loops three miles of wide concrete path suitable for walking, running, and bicycling. In addition, for an off the beaten path experience, the park offers two miles of unpaved trails which wind through the prairie grass. Several small hills make the path unsuitable for inexperienced inline skaters. The path is adorned by about twenty large sculptures from local artists. A playground, shelter, and parking lot are located near the Windsor Road entrance. A community garden, an herbal garden, the Timpone Ornamental Tree Grove and a shelter are located near the Race Street entrance. The park also contains many streams which are among the first tributaries of the Embarras River.
The Urbana Dog Park, located on East Perkins Road, is a place to walk one&#x27;s dog without a leash.

The Anita Purves Nature Center, located on the north end of Crystal Lake Park, offers nature education programs.

The &quot;Art in the Park&quot;, just north of the Urbana City Hall (400 S. Vine St.) dedicated October 2012, took 22 years of struggle and efforts of three mayors. The environmental and sculptural artists/curator of the park, John David Mooney designed the plantings, walkways, a 12-foot high fountain sculpture (Falling Leaf), and a 33-foot high light sculpture (Spirit Tree). The Spirit Tree specifically gives new meaning to Urbana&#x27;s designation as a &quot;Tree City&quot; and to trees as landmarks or beacons. Mooney, an internationally acclaimed artist, is a native to Champaign-Urbana.

===Swimming pools===
The Urbana Indoor Aquatic Center is a public indoor pool operated by the Urbana Park District and Urbana School District. It is located between Urbana High School and Urbana Middle School.

Crystal Lake Pool is a public outdoor pool. It is located on Broadway Street, across from the Anita Purves Nature Center. It was closed after the summer 2008 season due to deteriorating conditions and concomitant safety issues, it was rebuilt and reopened in 2013.

Campus Recreation Center East (CRCE) has an indoor leisure pool with a hot tub. CRCE is owned by the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign. In Urbana, the pools in Freer Hall, formerly a 25-yard and 6-lane lap pool, and Kenney Gym have been closed and filled, the former redeveloped as research and teaching spaces.

The Champaign-Urbana Velvets played in the Illinois–Missouri League from 1911 until the league disbanded after 1914. The city&#x27;s most recent minor league team was the Champaign-Urbana Bandits who played during the single 1994 season of the Great Central League. The Bandits played at Illinois Field. Prior to holding postseason play, the league folded. The Champaign-Urbana Colts played in the Central Illinois Collegiate League from 1990 until the team folded in 1996.

===Primary and secondary===
Urbana High School&#x27;s current building was built in 1914. It was designed by architect Joseph Royer who also designed many other area buildings such as the Urbana Free Library and the Champaign County Court House. The architecture is of the Tudor style defined primarily by the towers over the main entrance and flattened point arches over the doors.

Not part of the Urbana School District, University Laboratory High School, locally known as Uni High, is a publicly funded laboratory school located on the campus of the University of Illinois in Urbana. It was founded in 1921. It is a research project of the University of Illinois College of Education.

Urbana Middle School was first known as Urbana Junior High School in 1953. In 2003 the school was renovated for space. The school currently serves 954 students from grades 6 to 8.

The Elementary schools in Urbana are Leal, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Dr. Preston L. Williams Jr., Thomas Paine, and Yankee Ridge. Urbana Early Childhood School is the former Washington Early Childhood Center and is located on the Prairie Campus next to Dr. Preston L. Williams Elementary.

===Colleges and universities===
Most of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus lies in this city. It is a public land-grant research university and the flagship institution of the University of Illinois system. It is one of the largest public universities by enrollment in the United States with over 50,000 students enrolled annually, giving Urbana a large student population throughout the year.

===Urbana Free Library===

The Urbana Free Library, one of the first public libraries in Illinois, was founded in 1874 and is located in the downtown area. The historic building which houses the library was built in 1918. A major new addition was opened in 2005.

The library houses historical archives of Champaign County, which can be used for genealogical research. Established in 1956, the Champaign County Historical Archives is a department of the Urbana Free Library that maintains a research-level collection on the history and genealogy of Champaign County. In 1987 it was designated the official repository for non-current Champaign County records. Although it focuses on Champaign County, the Archives holds extensive collections of works dealing with the rest of Illinois and those states that document the significant migration routes of the communities that comprise Champaign County. The CCHA is also home to the Local History Online database. Local History Online gives access to holdings (books and journals, Champaign County records, City of Urbana municipal records, newspapers, directories, school yearbooks, images, maps, oral histories, local organization newsletters, and other special collections) of the Champaign County Historical Archives, including digital content. The catalog is frequently updated.

The library is publicly funded and receives additional support from about 600 people who have joined the Friends of the Urbana Free Library.

==Transportation==

Downtown Urbana is located southwest of the intersection of its two busiest streets: U.S. 150 (University Avenue) and U.S. 45 (Vine Street-Cunningham Avenue).

Most of Urbana lies south of I-74. There are three exits (from west to east): Lincoln (I-74 milepost 183), Cunningham (184) and University (185). The Lincoln exit is closest to the University of Illinois, while the Cunningham exit goes to downtown Urbana. The University exit goes to downtown Urbana as well as Illinois Route 130 to Philo.

Local bus service is primarily provided by the Champaign–Urbana Mass Transit District, although limited service is available from Champaign County Area Rural Transit System and Danville Mass Transit, operators which primarily serve Rantoul and Danville respectively.

The Norfolk Southern operates an east to west line through Urbana. The NS line connects industries in eastern Urbana to the Norfolk Southern main line at Mansfield, Illinois, west of Champaign. The line now operated by Norfolk Southern is the former Peoria &amp; Eastern Railway, later operated as part of the Big Four (Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway), New York Central, Penn Central, and Conrail systems, being sold by Conrail to Norfolk Southern in 1996. Construction of the line was begun by the Danville, Urbana, Bloomington and Pekin Railroad. This short-lived entity became part of the Indianapolis, Bloomington and Western Railway before the railroad was completed. A branch line of the Norfolk and Western Railway (formerly the Wabash Railroad) used to connect Urbana with the main line from Danville to Decatur at Sidney, Illinois, but this was first rerouted and later closed in the early 1990s.

University of Illinois Willard Airport serves the city.

==In popular culture==
In the 1968 film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, Urbana was named as the location where the HAL 9000 computer of the ill-fated Discovery Mission to Jupiter was programmed. The 1959 comedy &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; also mentions Urbana. Near the beginning of this film, Jack Lemmon&#x27;s character, an unemployed bass player, suggests to Tony Curtis, a saxophone player, that the two visit Urbana to play at the University of Illinois. Instead, the two musicians elected to join a women&#x27;s band in Florida. Urbana provides the setting for Bert I. Gordon&#x27;s 1957 science fiction film, &quot;Beginning of the End&quot;. Parodied on the television program, &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, this movie features the unintentional creation of dangerous, giant grasshoppers as a result of agricultural research gone awry.

University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign English Professor and National Book Award winner Richard Powers set his novel &quot;Galatea 2.2&quot; at the multidisciplinary Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology. Spanish writer Javier Cercas uses Urbana as the geographical background for two of his novels, &quot;La velocidad de la luz&quot; (2005) and &quot;El inquilino&quot; (1989).

The &quot;American Football House&quot;, which is famously pictured on emo band American Football&#x27;s albums, is located at 704 West High Street.

==Sister cities==

Urbana is twinned with three sister cities:
* Zomba, Malawi
* Haizhu, Guangzhou, China
* Thionville, France

The city of Urbana has been awarded a major grant from Sister Cities International to undertake a trilateral pilot project involving Urbana, Zomba, Malawi, and the Haizhu District, China. The one-year Sino-African Initiative grant is for up to $100,000 and will involve a collaborative effort to improve the municipal waste disposal system in Zomba, a city of 88,000 in southeast Africa. Urbana has had a Sister City relationship with Zomba since 2008, another relationship with Haizhu District, Guangzhou City, China since 2012, and added a third sister city charter with Thionville, France in 2014. Urbana is one of only three cities in the United States to be awarded a Sino-African grant. The others are Denver and an Asheville/Raleigh, N.C., joint team application.

==History==
Morrisonville is a small, rural town in Central Illinois. It is located south of the state&#x27;s capital, Springfield. Morrisonville has a rich history dating back to a time when it was used as a hunting ground for Native American Indians.

Before settlers established a town, four Indian tribes lived on Morrisonville&#x27;s land, the Sac, Fox, Pottawatomie, and Kickapoo. They competed with each other for buffalo, elk, and deer. Morrisonville was also part of the Black Hawk hunting ground.

Since 1492, six flags have flown over what is now Morrisonville, including Spain, France, Great Britain, Virginia, Indiana, and Illinois. Germans have also settled in this area. The Marsch&#x27;s and Millburgs were directly from Germany and settled there.

The town was incorporated under the general city and village law in May 1872. The first board of trustees consisted of the following: C.M. Leiberman, Dr. C. Voorhees, W.T. Ricks, E.S. Shull, and J.R. Hall. Siras Irion was police magistrate.

There were a few events that led up to this, such as on June 14, 1851, when Thomas Carlin, a former governor of Illinois, paid $1.25 an acre for land that is now Morrisonville, and in the fall of 1869, when Colonel James Morrison laid out the plat for the town. Colonel Morrison married Mary Ann Carlin in 1842. Mary Ann Carlin&#x27;s parents were Thomas A. Carlin and Rebecca Huitt Carlin. (Thomas Carlin established the town of Carrollton, Illinois, and the town of Carlinville is named in his honor.)

After Carlin purchased the land, he left it to his daughter, and she left it to her husband, Morrison, and then, when the town was established, it was named after him. In fact, on Perrine Street, there is still a house that Colonel Morrison built and lived in with his wife after the town of Morrisonville was established. Col. Morrison made an agreement with the railroad company that he would help build a new town if the railroad company would make Morrisonville a regular place to stop.

Even though the town was named after Morrison, Joseph Poggenpohl built the first house in the Morrisonville area in February 1870. Then, in May of the same year, the railroad was laid diagonally through Morrisonville. Once the railroad was established, Morrisonville became a regular stopping place for all trains and passengers. As soon as this happened, the town grew in population and business. After the first resident in the town proper, Richard McLean, built his house, people came here looking for a better living.

Since 1871, many land additions have been annexed to this town, such as T.F. Potts, Perrine, Johnson, Pence, Cloyd, and Shull. All of these streets were named after people who loved the land of Morrisonville and wanted to see it grow and prosper. Since its founding in 1872, people have found many ways to socialize, learn, live, and make a living in Morrisonville.

The first Morrisonville picnic was held on August 27, 1923, and it included a parade beginning on Sarpy Street, and marching to the City Park, speakers, a $1.00 prize for the tallest and shortest man, a fat man race, and free movies shown. Many people attended the event, as they still do today. It also includes the world&#x27;s largest bull frog jumping contest.

A craze that hit Morrisonville in the mid-1880s was roller skating. In fact, it was so popular a building was built just for roller skating. It was later used as the Knights of Columbus hall. In 1926, the Knights of Columbus purchased the “Opera House” from the Morrisonville Moose Lodge. Many activities were held there, including dances, card parties, talent shows, church bazaar, and roller-skating.

Ever since the 1920s, the local lumber company (Morrisonville Lumber Company) has remained in the same location, and fire has destroyed two office buildings; one in the early 1920s, and one in 1974.

Through the years, Morrisonville has been known as a very religious community. Some churches in Morrisonville are the First Baptist Church, the First United Presbyterian Church, St. Maurice Church, and the United Methodist Church. Colonel Morrison donated the land for St. Maurice. The first church was a large frame building on the corner of Fuller and Third Streets, and cost $4,000. “Schools in and around Morrisonville have made a big part of our history.”

In 1870, the first school was built. It also served as a Sunday school and a town hall. The present St. Maurice School was built in 1922, and contained a full basement and a large room across the entire front of the school. “Country children would drive a horse and buggy to school.”

Some of the first businesses to open in Morrisonville that are still open today are Becker&#x27;s Clothing Store and Morrisonville Lumber Company.

When Morrisonville abandoned the old Village Hall/firehouse, the Morrisonville Historical Society was organized in an effort to raise funds for preservation of this historic building, and renovate it for a museum. They housed artifacts such as old clothing, dolls and doll furniture, a collection of typewriters, old school and business pictures, sports memorabilia, and Morrisonville&#x27;s first jail cell.

==The Village Hall==

The village hall in Morrisonville was constructed in 1891.

The original construction was destroyed by fire in April 1891, and construction on the present building was started soon after the fire.

The bricks used in this structure were manufactured in Morrisonville at the Fleigle Tile yard.

After its completion, the second floor of the building was used as the office and meeting place for the village board of trustees; the jail and storage area for the fire equipment being on the ground floor.

Because of deterioration of the second floor, the village board has been holding their meetings for the past few years in a rented building on Carlin Street.

Leiberman built and opened up the second store, and his store, as that of Mr. Bell, was located on Carlin Street. D.F. Bonnell became the third merchant, all of these men entering commercial life at Morrisonville during 1870.

On February 8, 1915, the DRL Supply Company began business in Morrisonville. The Lentz brothers, Henry and Theodore, started in business when they purchased the interest of the late E.C. Dey in the grocery and dry goods firm that was then known as Dey &amp; Rittger. The firm name was changed to DRL Supply Co., with the late Charles Rittger managing the dry goods department and the Lentz brothers in charge of the grocery department. In April 1936, the buildings housing the DRL were destroyed by fire and all stock was a total loss. The store was rebuilt immediately following the fire, and in November 1937, there was a move into a new modern brick building. DRL Supply Co. is now closed and has been for many years.

Other general stores opened in the past include Thatcher Millinery and Fancy Goods Store and Johnson Equipment Company.

==Grocers and bakeries==

Some of the older grocery stores in Morrisonville were DRL Supply Company, Atzger Bakery &amp; Confectionery, Miller Bros. Meat Market, W.L. Long, Weber&#x27;s Grocery, and others.

In 1937, Melvin Stewart came to Morrisonville from Hillsboro, with his wife, Elizabeth, and sons, Bob and Jim. He worked for the late Charles Shake in his grocery store and meat market for four years. In 1941, Melvin&#x27;s brother, Robert H. and his family also moved to Morrisonville, and the two brothers opened a small IGA store which was located in the former Zeb Safrit grocery store building. Later, with the encouragement and patronage of farmers in the community, they installed a locker plant in the rear of the building. When the locker business was discontinued in 1952, Mr. Stewart remodeled the store.

==History==

Mount Auburn was founded on July 11, 1839. It was seriously considered as possibility for the state capital at the time the center of government was moved from Vandalia to Springfield.

The following information was found in an article by Jane Long in The Breeze, a Taylorville newspaper. &gt;

MT. AUBURN — In the early beginnings of this country, as pioneers trekked west for opportunity and prosperity, the old Cumberland Road, which began at Cumberland, Maryland, was left by many at Terre Haute, Indiana. These people then followed what was known as the Terre Haute-Decatur-Springfield Trail, which passed south of Decatur, south of the Sangamon River, through what became Mt. Auburn and on to Springfield.
The Village of Mt. Auburn was founded in 1839, located on an elevation about fifty feet above the surrounding country.

In the &quot;Springfield Journal&quot; of September 18, 1839, the new village was described as follows: &quot;This elevation is most beautiful and commands an extensive view, overlooking the country for some ten or fifteen miles, and embracing within the limits of vision the towns of Allenton, Stonington, and but for an intervening skirt of time Edinburg, and part of Sangamon and Logan counties. The improvements in Mt. Auburn are at this time limited. It was surveyed and platted by J.R. Skinner, on July 11, 1839. Not a blow had been struck for its improvement until this date. Now it has one large store, one large barn designed for the use of a tavern, and one dwelling house. Materials are now collected for the erection of a brick tavern house, which it is intended will be second to none in the state. Within a circuit of eight miles around Mt. Auburn 140 families are located. The population recently arrived is mostly from the New England states. The old residents are generally from Kentucky, Tennessee and the south.

&quot;This tract of country, for beauty, fertility and health, we do not believe is exceeded in any location in the state. The land is gently and agreeable undulating, such as any eastern man would select for a farm, every foot of which seems capable of cultivation.&quot;

Established on May 8 of that year, the Mt. Auburn Post Office is reputed to be the oldest now in existence in Christian County. For years, rumor had it that Mt. Auburn was even considered as a site for the state capital, along with Springfield, Quincy and East St. Louis, when the capital was moved from Vandalia.

The first steam mill in the county was done by John B. Augur in Mt. Auburn in the summer of 1840. It consisted of a saw mill and one pair of burrs for grinding corn. Augur settled in Mt. Auburn as an agent of an Eastern colony company that owned a tract of land containing about 40,000 acres in Dane County (later called Christian County), 15,000 of which are heavily timbered. He also was the proprietor of the first store in the village, which he opened in 1839, and was the first postmaster.

Early Mt. Auburn commerce included two stores, blacksmith shop, tavern, and other commerce around a square at the top of the hill. The Terre Haute-to-Quincy stage route brought travelers to the village.

The First United Methodist Church of Mt. Auburn had its beginning in 1843 with the organization of a church class by six people at a meeting held in the home of Mr. and Mrs. John Benson. The class continued until 1851, when a Methodist circuit was formed that consisted of Mt. Auburn, Eagle School and Washington School in Christian County and Nebraska School and Blue Mound in Macon County. Construction of a church located where the present building stands was completed in 1856 at a cost of about $3000. Mrs. Gregg, a cousin of Harry Bottrell&#x27;s mother, gave the ground where the church stands and also the Mt. Auburn Cemetery site. The church trustees voted on May 16, 1868, to erect a parsonage. The first church stood on almost the same site as the present one, with two doors, one for the men and women entering in the other. The present church was erected on the site of the old church in 1926, and dedication took place on March 20–27, 1927.

In 1866 the congregation of the Church of Christ which had been holding services in the Brush Schoolhouse, some three miles northeast of Mt. Auburn, moved their church into the village and built a chapel. It was later remodeled in 1898. In 1875 the congregation broke up, and for a period of twelve years the house was opened only for funerals. A series of meetings were held in 1887 and revived the congregation. The current house of worship for the Mt. Auburn Church of Christ was erected in 1918.

A cholera epidemic in 1854 created many deaths and caused those who did survive to leave the hill.

Originally incorporated in 1862, the charter was later relinquished and then rechartered in 1892.

When the Indianapolis-Decatur and Western Railroad extended its line from Decatur to Springfield in 1901, village commerce moved to the south side of the hill, causing a building boom for both businesses and residential property. Mt. Auburn was reportedly the most important station between the two cities. Other stations along the line in Christian County were Osbernville, Bolivia and Roby.

The Mt. Auburn Independent Telephone System, a locally owned telephone system, was established in early 1905 by local businessmen F. B. Mulberry and Carl Miller. Mt. Auburn had a great building boom in the spring of 1905, both in the business and residential districts. Every business house but one decided to move from the top of the hill to the south end of town. Their buildings were either moved or new ones were built.

Commerce in 1906 included the railroad station, livery stable, hardware and implement stores, lumber yard, barber shop, saloons, elevator, hotel, harness shops, opera house, bank, restaurants and drug stores, to name a few.

In 1911 Oliver Hardy, Edward L. Smith, S. R. Shepherd and F. B. Mulberry formed a partnership and took over the business of the First National Bank that was first opened in 1901. This bank has continued to provide services for residents of Mt. Auburn and the surrounding community throughout the years, one of the oldest banks in the county.

In 1918, the Wurl Electric Light Company brought electricity to those who could afford it.

Four daily trains provided connections east and west with the rest of the world.

A serious fire in 1922 destroyed many businesses along the west side of Broad Street, but shortly new construction replaced those that were lost.

The construction of the munition plant near Illiopolis during World War II was a boom to the local economy. Even though many young men and women from the area served their country in the war effort, many others served at home by working at the plant.

In February 1919, a petition was initiated to establish a community high school, which would take in five school districts in Mosquito Township and four school districts in Mt. Auburn Township. The petition was filed and the election was to be held on March 8, 1919. The election was canceled by the State Superintendent due to a Supreme Court ruling invalidating the law under which the petition was filed.

In July 1919, a second petition was initiated. This election was held on July 19, 1919, with voters approving the establishment of the Mt. Auburn Community High School by a vote of 290 to 139.

On Monday, September 22, 1919, the Mt. Auburn Community High School began classes with twenty-two pupils and two instructors. Classes were held in the lower level of the Masonic Lodge.

After one unsuccessful referendum, the voters approved a proposition on October 10, 1925, to purchase a site and construct a high school. The Mt. Auburn High School was built in 1926 on what was then known as the D.C. Armstrong site, twelve lots one block east of the village park. The total cost of the original building was reportedly $44,184, with the site costing $1800.

On Monday, September 6, 1926, the new Mt. Auburn High School opened for classes with 69 students enrolled. The first graduating class from the new building was in 1927.

On March 1, 1949, an architect was employed to design an addition to the building which would house the library, agriculture class room and shop area. In 1951 the addition was constructed as a cost of $44,000. On November 16, 1952, this new addition was dedicated.

The present elementary school was built in 1952, with a cafeteria and gymnasium, as well as a large playground and an agricultural experiment acreage. Mt. Auburn had become a unit school in 1949.

On November 7, 1989, voters approved the idea to deactivate the high school and tuition the students to Taylorville High School. With the 69th graduation on May 25, 1990, the Mt. Auburn Community High School classes came to an end. Records indicate that 1135 students graduated from Mt. Auburn.

In 1992 the school district annexed to the Taylorville School District. Though elementary children from grades kindergarten through fifth grade attend school in Mt. Auburn, junior- and senior-high students attend school in Taylorville. On July 4, 1992, the interior of the high school building was burned and on Monday, July 6, 1992, the building was demolished.

In August 1994, a twelve-foot-square, patio-style, brick memorial

was dedicated in the village park during the Mt. Auburn Farmers Picnic to honor the high school. The actual stone nameplate, salvaged from the high school, was placed on top of a black granite slab which included the etched image of the high school and its proud Eagle mascot.

With agriculture and ag-related industries the biggest of the community, today approximately twenty businesses are located in Mt. Auburn, though many of these are small businesses that are run from the business owners&#x27; homes. Businesses include a gas station, greenhouse and floral shop, auto repair, fertilizer company, elevator, tavern, bank, electrical contractor, building contractor and plumbing contractor. Though some of these businesses are relatively new, the First National Bank was begun in 1911. Hardy Fertilizer Co. celebrates its fortieth anniversary in the year 2000.

Though shopping malls, discount groceries and interstate highways have ended some of the commercial trade in Mt. Auburn, construction of such new enterprises as the new three-hole golf course and new fire station, both completed in 2000, new gas station built three years ago and the recently acquired village hall, along with about thirty-five building permits issued for new homes or major remodeling projects, indicate the growth in the village of approximately 550 people and the commitment of these residents to their home on the hill.

==Picnic==
An annual event is the Mount Auburn Picnic. Started in 1887 in Morganville by 13 men including Hi Montgomery and T. A. Montgomery, the picnic was moved to Mt Auburn in 1919. Currently the event is held in the Mount Auburn city park.

The Central A&amp;M FFA Chapter is also a successful chapter in section, district and State FFA Events, as well as community service activities.

==History==
Moweaqua was named after a small stream 1.5 miles south of the station, called by the Indians Moweaqua, a Pottawatamie word that means &quot;she that weeps&quot;.
From 1891 until 1935, Moweaqua was the site of a gassy coal mine that mined coal from Pennsylvanian strata. On the morning of December 24, 1932, fifty-four coal miners, the entire day shift, were killed by a methane gas explosion in the Moweaqua coal mine disaster. The incident occurred on the morning of Christmas Eve, and one of the deceased miners, Tom Jackson, had been scheduled to play Santa Claus in a party to be held that evening for his fellow townspeople. The tragic explosion, together with the election in the previous month (November 1932) of the pro-labor Seventy-Third Congress, led to the passage of mine safety legislation and the phaseout of open-flame carbide miner&#x27;s lanterns in United States coal mines. The &quot;Moweaqua Coal Mine Museum&quot; opened in 1986 to commemorate local coal miners, especially the victims of this disaster.

The 2009 movie &quot;The Informant&quot; starring Matt Damon was partially filmed in Moweaqua. The plot of the movie is based on the ADM price fixing scandal which occurred during the 1990s.

The school building was abandoned and then torn down and the children are now bused to Morrisonville. The Palmer State Bank opened in 1912 and was the oldest state bank in the Christian County. It was the only one that did not close during the Depression, but finally, shut its doors in 2006.

==Early history of Palmer==

The coming of the railroad in 1870 sounded the doom of Harpers Ferry, located on the Old Edwardsville Road. Harpers Ferry hosted a post office for Star Route pony express, a mill for grinding grain, a wayside station for the Stagecoach, and a few stores. The new village was laid out early in 1869 by J.H. Boyd and J.M. Simpson and was surveyed and platted by Richard V. Powell. Boyd and Simpson erected the first store in 1869 and the firm of Starke and Hailey put in a stock of goods. Boyd erected a hotel and his residence was included within the town limits. James McCauley opened the second store and when the first post office was established in 1870 it was housed in his building with G.E. Starke the first postmaster.

The village was incorporated on February 5, 1873, at a meeting called for that purpose. Forty-one votes were cast in favor of incorporation, and one against, giving as his reason for voting &quot;no&quot;-&quot;to keep saloons out of the neighborhood.&quot; The village was given the name Palmer in honor of John M. Palmer, a major-general in the Union army and then Illinois governor from 1869 to 1873.

During the history of Palmer, there have been hardware stores, millinery stores, restaurants, lumber yards, harness shops, grocery stores, drug stores, shoe shops, butcher shops, elevators, blacksmith shops, saloons, hotels, pool halls, livery stables, bakeries, garages, post offices, and barber shops. The first hotel was owned by a family named the Stockings, the family of Ashley Basil, a 5-year-old killed in 1895 in the old coal shaft. Her final resting place is in Harpers Ferry.

==Mining industry==

A familiar landmark in Palmer is the old coal shaft. At one time it was the dream of a group of citizens in the area to sink a coal mine, bringing industry, employment, and fuel to the community. The site selected to sink the mine was in the southwest edge of town, on the north side of the railroad. According to ledgers still in existence, kept on sinking of the shaft, MacDonald and Bro., did the drilling. On March 30, 1872, the first share of stock was sold to Suplines Judd for $100. Many other shares were also sold for $100, some for $70 and some for $50. A total of seventy-two shares were sold in the amount of $5,460. Corporation papers were recorded on June 14, 1872. The cost of sinking the shaft was $2.50 per foot, and it is believed that the depth was approximately . The last entry made in the ledger was November 3, 1873, the sinking of the shaft was abandoned with no reason given.

About 1932, Illinois State Route 48 was constructed through Palmer - part of it over the top of the old mine. On September 10, 1969, the old mine shaft, so long abandoned, become more dangerous than ever before. At 9:00 a.m. a little hole was visible, as though someone had hauled dirt away. By 3:45 p.m., the same day the hole was larger, by and deeper; that evening it was a large hole filled with water with rotted timbers floating on top and was 375 to deep, threatening to flood the highway. The old mine shaft had caved in. Traffic was re-routed from the highway and the trains on the Norfolk and Western traveled at a very slow speed, as the Highway Department was afraid of a further cave in. Approximately 190 truckloads of slag, rock, and dirt were hauled to the site and the shaft was filled at an estimated cost of $30,000.

<text>Pana is a small town in Christian County, Illinois, United States. A small portion is in Shelby County. The population was 5,199 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The area around Pana was first organized as Stone Coal Precinct in 1845. The county&#x27;s precincts became townships in 1856, and Stone Coal Precinct became Pana Township, Christian County, Illinois. In 1857 the village of Pana was incorporated. The name &quot;Pana&quot; is believed to have been derived from the indigenous tribe, the Pawnee. It developed at the intersection of east–west and north–south railroads, and had supplies of fuel and water for the steam engines of the railroad.

Pana was recognized as a sundown town. 

This became a center of coal mining in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In April 1899 what is known as the Pana riot broke out after a violent confrontation between black and white miners. Initially a white man was killed (by a policeman, it was later discovered), and white union miners attacked black replacement workers who had been recruited from Alabama. Six additional people were killed: one white (likely also shot by a white man) and five blacks; in addition, six more black miners were wounded. While the immediate violence was quelled, blacks felt tremendous hostility. Rather than return to Alabama and the Jim Crow South, from where they had been recruited, 211 of the nearly 300 African Americans remaining in town moved west to Weir, Kansas, to work at another mine.

It came to be known as the City of Roses, a nickname coined by local newsmen, the Jordan Brothers. Many major florists and growers set up shop here. At one time, there were 109 greenhouses in Pana.

Kitchell Park was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. The Louis Jehle House, added to the National Register in 1995, is also located in Pana.

==History==
Marshall was officially organized by William B. Archer in 1835, eight years after the National Road entered the community. The city was named after John Marshall, chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Marshall was incorporated on May 14, 1873.

In 1863, Marshall was the scene of conflict in which local Copperheads, who opposed the Civil War, sought to protect soldiers who had deserted from the Union Army. In March, 1863, an army detail from Indiana arrested several deserters. A local judge, Charles H. Constable, freed the deserters and ordered the arrest of two Union sergeants on kidnapping charges. This resulted in the dispatch of 250 soldiers under the command of Col. Henry B. Carrington by special train from Indianapolis, who surrounded the courthouse, freed the sergeants and arrested judge Charles H. Constable. The judge was, however, absolved several months later after presenting a highly technical defense.

Marshall was home to the Handy Writers&#x27; Colony, 1950–1964. The most famous writer associated with the Colony was the novelist James Jones, who built a home in Marshall and lived there ca. 1952–1957.

==History==
In the early 1800s Solomon Harter Mueller (later Miller) came to Clay City, IL. with his Cherokee wife (later Ida) and 6 children, from W. Virginia to establish a farm and grinding Mill. He later built a smokehouse, general store and Milinary shop. Solomon also brought his brother George C with wife Caroline and 5 children. Solomon and Ida had children : Isom, Mary, Otto, Roy, Louise and Zella all born in Clay City. Great-grandchildren of Louise: Wallace, and Caroline left Clay City, for St. Louis, Mo. Paul George left for Ohio, and ultimately lost oil and mineral rights in Clay City/C

In 1810 John McCawley and Seth Evans were traveling west from Fort Vincennes along the old Buffalo Trace when one of their horses died. McCawley sent his companion back for another horse. McCawley stayed behind in a cabin built on the west bank of the Little Wabash River just south and east of the future Clay City. This made McCawley the first white man to settle in this area. McCawley later decided to build a stagecoach stop and trading center on the location which was known as McCawley&#x27;s Tavern. It provided a place for travelers to stop, eat, and spend the night.

Clay County was created by an act of the legislature on December 23, 1824. On Tuesday, March 8, 1825, at John McCawley&#x27;s place, the first county commissioners&#x27; court assembled for the new county of Clay. In 1825 Daniel May donated of land, just over west of McCawley&#x27;s Tavern, to the county for the purpose of constructing a courthouse. This land is one block south of US 50 and to the west of what is now South Main Street. This area had previously been known as Hubbardsville but was renamed Maysville. A two-room courthouse was constructed in 1825, and court was held at Maysville until 1841 when it was moved to the new and present county seat, Louisville. 
In 1855, after the O&amp;M Railroad was located about north of Maysville, Clay City was established by Mr. J.D. Perkey on the north side of the tracks and mostly to the east of the present North Main Street. The business district soon developed to the south of the tracks where it is presently located. Maysville was made a part of the Village of Clay City in 1862. 
Clay City served as a trading center for the surrounding countryside. Farmers could bring their produce to town and trade it for dry goods, etc. and very little money would change hands. With the passenger trains stopping in Clay City it also served as a source of transportation for the surrounding area. Many of the tourists who traveled to the once famous resort of Sailor Springs would take the train to Clay City and then use local transportation on up to Sailor Springs. 
In 1936 oil was discovered in this area, and oil-related businesses continue to thrive in Clay City today.

<text>Flora is a city in Clay County, Illinois, United States. The population was 4,803 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Flora was founded by Samuel White. White was born September 10, 1831, in Warren County, Ohio. He and his family came to Clay County in 1852. During that time, he purchased of land from the State of Illinois. His first wife, Sarah Ann Wall was born in 1833. Sarah died December 13, 1859, in Flora, and is buried in the family plot in Elmwood Cemetery. In December 1860, White married Helen M. Riggs in Flora.

The original town of Flora was laid out, surveyed and platted in February 1854 by Ethelred Nixon, County Surveyor; John Brown, Trustee for Songer, Camp &amp; Company; and Samuel White. It embraced eighty-five acres of the west half of Section 25, Township 3 north Range 6 east. Samuel White who still owned the land, deeded one-half interest in forty acres to John Brown, Trustee, with a view of securing the town and depot. An effort had already been made to establish a town one mile west called Mooresville, where over 100 lots had been sold and some buildings done. After the collapse of that village, the principal house was moved to Flora, and was then known as the &quot;Commercial House.&quot;

Samuel White also donated land to the City of Flora for several buildings and the city park. The City Park, at that time called the Public Square, is present day Library Park where Flora Public Library is located. White donated land for the 1st schoolhouse, the Baptist Church and parsonage. Land was also donated for streets and alleys of the original town of Flora. The city&#x27;s founder died November 15, 1912, in Sterling, Colorado, and was returned to Flora for burial in the family plot at Elmwood.

From &quot;Flora, Illinois - Founded 1854&quot; compiled by Flora Resident, Jeanie Briscoe.
The book also contains historic information about the B &amp; O railroad, the history of various buildings, and obituaries of some of Flora&#x27;s early citizens.

== Economy ==
In September 1960, Flora was named &quot;Ford Town USA&quot; and some 1500 vehicle owners were supplied with a new Ford car or truck to drive during that week.

Flora&#x27;s main industry is agriculture, although there are companies located in Flora that employ several hundreds. Flora is surrounded by a gently rolling countryside, with approximately 80-85% of it dedicated to farming and livestock.

==The Flora B&amp;O Depot==
The Flora B&amp;O Depot was built in 1872 with generous help from local citizens. It served the City of Flora until 1916, when it was destroyed by fire.

In 1916–1917, a new three-story brick depot was built. This building was a huge part of the economic life of the community during those early years. In the 1920s, the railroad employed half the wage earners in Flora. In 1924, three hundred employees worked at the local station.

When the depot was completed in 1917, it contained three floors. The main floor was used for passengers. It had a large waiting room with a baggage room and restrooms. The Western Union office, yard office, mailroom and ticket office were also located on this floor.

The second floor held the offices of important depot members. Men who occupied these offices included the chief clerk, division engineer, superintendents, dispatchers, carpenters, signal supervisors, train masters and road foremen, plus railroad law enforcement officers and the district&#x27;s own physician.

The third floor contained large offices. Later, these offices became one social room. It was here that railroad employees and their families held potluck dinners and socials. Not only was the depot a hub of transportation and commerce, it was a center for much of the social life in the community.

In the 1950s, as roads improved, cars became the chief means of transportation. Travelers no longer looked to trains as the primary source of transportation. The depot became less important to the community and the days of hosting 12 passenger trains, daily passing through Flora, became a fond memory.

In 1998, the Flora B&amp;O Depot was named one of three sites in Clay County on the National Register of Historic Places. With this recognition and the interest of many citizens of the community, the Flora Community Development Corporation (FCDC) purchased the depot from CSX Railroad.

FCDC successfully obtained three federal grants to restore the building, matched by local donations of citizens. Today, the University of Illinois Extension Service rents the third floor. The second floor is a community room available to rent for various activities. The first floor houses the Flora Chamber of Commerce office, a museum containing city and county historical artifacts and two unfinished room available for occupancy.

More history, rent/leasing information, and events can be found on their website.
==&#x27;Is We Is&#x27;==
In 1987 a group of Flora officials formed the so-called &quot;Barbed Wire Choir&quot; and recorded a music video in an attempt to land a state prison. The song featured several city officials, including the mayor, asking then-Gov. Jim Thompson &quot;Is we is or is we isn&#x27;t/gonna get ourselves a prison.&quot; After being shown on local TV stations, the video gained the attention of national programs such as MTV, &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and &quot;The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers&quot;. Flora ultimately lost its bid to host the new prison.

<text>Breese is a city in Clinton County, Illinois, United States. Breese is the most populous city completely within Clinton County. As of the 2020 census, the population was 4,641, the majority of whom are of German ancestry. Breese is part of the Metro-East region of the Greater St. Louis metropolitan area.

==History==
The town is named after Sidney Breese, a United States Senator and a contemporary of President Abraham Lincoln. Breese was founded in 1855.

Even though the area around Breese, Illinois was first settled in 1816, it was not until 1835 that Germans came to the town to farm because of the flat fertile land there. Twenty years after the Germans&#x27; first immigration, the Mississippi and Ohio Railroad was completed. The early pioneers were enthralled by the thought of transportation by railroad. The Chicago-based company Sanger Kamp &amp; Co. bought 80 acres of land near the railroad. Twenty-four acres were laid out with the railroad splitting the original town with some acres on the north side and south side creating Breese Township, February 3, 1855.

Late in 1855, forty Catholic immigrants, wanting to fulfill their religious needs, had the idea of constructing a church. Their desires were realized when two years later the Sanger Kamp &amp; Co. gave half of one of its to the Catholics’ project. By December 1869, St. Dominic&#x27;s Catholic Church was completed. Breese was first recognized as a town on April 11, 1871, and later became a village on September 23, 1876. As a result, the construction of the village hall had begun. This project was completed in 1885. Seven years later a volunteer fire department was organized. The ever-growing population was then acknowledged as a city on January 19,
1905. The mayor of this new city was Henry Hummert.

Realizing that Breese would need some improvements, the mayor authorized the construction of an electric light plant that was completed in 1906. The streets of Breese were also topped with road oil in 1911. The next year improvements to the city&#x27;s water works facility were also made.

However, things took a turn for the worse when, in 1914, a scarlet fever swept the community and its surrounding area and forced all the schools to close. Only four years later, still in the wake of the scarlet fever, the flu epidemic spread through the area.

===1906 Coal mine disaster===
On December 24, 1906, Six miners were killed and one injured when a mine cage collapsed and fell down the shaft in a mine owned and operated by The Breese and Trenton Coal Company. The miners killed included Henry Middeke, Herman Scheleper, Walter Schaffner, August Foppe, Frank Zehrer, and Hermann Holtmann. The only one injured was mine manager William Fritz. An investigation concluded that improper filling of an old air shaft caused a dirt slide leading to the collapse. The Breese and Trenton Coal Company was found guilty of negligence.

<text>Carlyle is a city in and the county seat of Clinton County, Illinois, United States. The population was 3,253 at the 2020 census. 

Carlyle is located approximately east of St. Louis, Missouri, and is home to Illinois&#x27; largest man-made lake, Carlyle Lake, and to the General Dean Suspension Bridge, a suspension bridge that is the only one of its kind in Illinois and crosses the Kaskaskia River.

==History==
In 1811 or 1812, a man named John Hill built one of several &quot;block&quot; houses along the Goshen Trail, located at what is currently 201 Fairfax Street. The houses were reportedly built to serve as a line of defense against Native Americans. John Hill built the first house to be located in what has become Carlyle. He also established what could be considered Carlyle&#x27;s first business: a ferry to carry traffic across the Kaskaskia River, including a small shelter at the river which served as a toll house.

In 1816, Charles Slade and two of his brothers reached the John Hill settlement and bought him out. Charles farmed the land, took over the ferry, and within a year partnered with a man named Hubbard to start the first store, a mercantile business located at what is now 301 Fairfax Street. In 1818, a man named Calvin Barnes laid out town lots. On March 10, 1819, a post office was first established under the name Carlisle, Illinois. This spelling might have been a clerical error.

The area was settled after the 1809 creation of the Illinois Territory but before Illinois achieved statehood, six to seven years after John Hill had already built his establishment. Illinois&#x27; first state capitol was located in Kaskaskia, but in 1820 the state decided that it should be moved. Carlyle lost to Vandalia by one vote. In 1824, the State of Illinois created Clinton County by carving it out of Washington, Bond, and Fayette counties. Carlyle was to be the county seat should land be donated for this purpose. Charles Slade donated of property so that the county seat would be located in Carlyle.

Carlyle was founded in 1818 by Charles W. Slade, father of Joseph &quot;Jack&quot; Slade, who named the town after his grandmother&#x27;s family. It was incorporated as a town on 2/10/1837 and incorporated as a city on 4/17/1884. Carlyle celebrated 150 years and used the 1837 date.

Charles Slade pushed hard for Carlyle to become the state capital of Illinois, but lost by one vote to Vandalia in 1819. In 1824, Clinton County was formed, and Carlyle became the county seat in July 1825, both at the initiative of Charles Slade.

==Geography==

Carlyle is located slightly east of the center of Clinton County at (38.612642, -89.370789). The Kaskaskia River flows through the easternmost part of the city out of Carlyle Dam, located just northeast of the city limits and which impounds Carlyle Lake, the largest lake wholly in Illinois.

U.S. Route 50 passes through the city, leading east to Salem and west to St. Louis. Illinois Route 127 leads north to Greenville and south to Nashville, Illinois. The General Dean Suspension Bridge, built in 1859 and named after Major General William F. Dean in 1953, crosses the Kaskaskia River just north of the current US 50 bridge.

According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Carlyle has a total area of , of which (or 99.97%) is land and (or 0.03%) is water.

<text>Centralia is a city in Clinton, Jefferson, Marion, and Washington counties in the U.S. state of Illinois with the largest portion in Marion County. The city is the largest in three counties, Clinton, Marion, and Washington, but it is not a county seat for any of them. The population was 12,182 as of the 2020 census, down from 13,032 in 2010.

==History==
Centralia is named for the Illinois Central Railroad, built in 1853. The city was founded where the two original branches of the railroad converged. Centralia was first chartered as a city in 1859. Now Canadian National owns the line.

The intersection of the Third Principal Meridian and its baseline is in the southern city limits. This initial point was established in 1815, and it governs land surveys for about 60% of the state of Illinois, including Chicago. The original monument is at the junction of Highway 51 and the Marion-Jefferson County Line Road; today there is a small easement situated in the northeast corner of this intersection, which contains a monument and historical marker.

Production of the PayDay candy bar began here in 1938. Michael Moore&#x27;s documentary, &quot;The Big One&quot; (1998), opens with the closing of this candy bar plant in the late 20th century. It addresses similar economic woes in other cities.

The town of Centerville, Washington, was renamed Centralia, Washington to avoid being confused with another Centerville in that state. A former resident of the Illinois town suggested the change.

Centralia&#x27;s city flag was designed in 1924 by Wendell Bauer, whose design was awarded first prize in a community-wide design competition. A broad red stripe through the center of the flag represents the railroads to which the city owes its existence. A gold star above and below the stripe signifies the area&#x27;s mining and agricultural industries. Lastly, a triangle pyramid with a sphinx head design is symbolic of Egypt, a tribute to Southern Illinois’ nickname, “Little Egypt”.

The Centralia mine disaster occurred in 1947 when the nearby Centralia No. 5 coal mine exploded, killing 111 people. The disaster was memorialized in folk singer Woody Guthrie&#x27;s song &quot;The Dying Miner&quot;.

==Geography==
Centralia is located approximately east of St. Louis, Missouri. Most of the city, including its downtown, is in southwestern Marion County, but the city extends west into Clinton County and south into Washington and Jefferson counties. The city is north of exit 61 of Interstate 64 and west of exit 109 of Interstate 57. Centralia is one of three Illinois cities with portions in four counties, the others being Barrington Hills and Aurora. Because of its unique location within multiple counties, portions of Centralia are associated with different Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs). The Centralia Micropolitan Statistical Area includes all of Marion County. The Clinton County portion of the city is considered part of the St. Louis, MO–IL Metropolitan Statistical Area, while the Jefferson County portion lies within the Mt. Vernon Micropolitan Statistical Area. The portion of Centralia in Washington County is not considered part of any metropolitan or micropolitan area.

The name Langenfield was also connected to the historic Langenfield Motor Company buildings.

The Centralia Sentinel Building houses the Centralia Morning Sentinel newspaper and features Egyptian Revival style architecture. This may be connected to Southern Illinois&#x27; nickname of &quot;Egypt,&quot; or &quot;Little Egypt.&quot;

The Centralia Orphans were the State Runner-Up in the 2011 Class 3A.

The Orphans got their unique nickname during the early 1900s when the boys&#x27; basketball team made it to the state tournament. The school was low on funds then, and the team was forced to pick its uniforms from a pile of non-matching red uniforms. At the state tournament, an announcer commented that the team looked like a bunch of orphans on the court because of their mismatched uniforms. The name stuck. Previously, the team had gone by nicknames such as the Reds and Cardinals. In 2013 and 2014, the Centralia Orphans were recently named the Most Unique Mascot in the nation by &quot;USA Today&quot;.

The private Christ, Our Rock Lutheran High School first opened its doors in August 2004 with nine students. As of 2013, the student body has grown to over 100 students. Christ Our Rock is the home of the Silver Stallions.

==Geography==
Trenton is located at (38.605943, -89.681725).

According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Trenton has a total area of , all land.

== History ==
The town was laid out by A. W. Casad in 1836 from Trenton, New Jersey, he gave his new town the name Trenton which he named after the place he was from. The planned town was supposed to be built just north of the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad in an area which is now called the “Old Trenton”. However, the old town was abandoned as no one ever built in the lots they bought. In response to his failed venture, Mr. Casad returned to his hometown of Trenton, New Jersey. Mr. William Lewis, A. W. Casad&#x27;s brother in law however didn’t go back to New Jersey. Instead, he opted to stay and built a farmhouse where the current town lies in 1818.

In 1853 Mr. Buckman built a railroad depot and even managed to get a post office to be established however his business partner Mr. Walker abandoned him which made Buckman move out of the area. Buckman would eventually resettle in Iowa.

On 14 May 1855, Alva Lewis refounded the town, and this time it stayed. Several more major additions were added to the town throughout the mid-1800s by multiple other people and companies. On 12 March 1856 and 11 June 1860 by William Lewis, 22 May 1856 and 2 July 1866 by Joseph Hanke, 12 June 1856 by Sanger Ramp &amp; Co, and finally by Mathias Leonard and Sanger Kamp on 26 May 1868.

On 16 February 1856, the town was chartered as a village with one Joseph P. Hanke as its mayor. By 1868 the town’s south side had taken shape and no new major additions were added to that side of Town. On 20 September 1887, the Town was incorporated as a city, the town was now called the City of Trenton which is the name it currently holds.

In 1865 a coal mine was built in the town and in 1868 it reach full operational capacity. The mine was founded by Joseph Hanke, Wm. Schaeffer, and Johnson Buchter with the mine eventually being bought out completely by Joseph Hanke. Hanke himself would be bought out by Consolidated Coal Company based out of St Louis. Out of the 500 men in the town 300 were employed by the mine. On 27 February 1909, the south mine burned down and never reopened causing a huge financial blow to the town.

The first church established in the town was St. John United Church of Christ in 1840. This would be followed by the St. Mary Catholic Church in 1864, Grace Community Baptist Church in 1882, the West Gate southern Baptist Church in 1961, and the New Life Christian Center in 1985. Many of these churches host humanitarian and education ventures. These include a food pantry held at West Gate Baptist Church and a preschool held at St. John United Church of Christ.

In 1886 a school was built in the town after the first one was destroyed in a fire. In 1957 a merger of New Baden, New Memphis, and Trenton formed the Wesclin School District #3 with a high school being built in 1972 along Route 161 exactly 2.5 miles between New Baden and Trenton. A new high school was built in 2014.

Ashmore is home to Ashmore Estates, which was originally the almshouse at the Coles County Poor Farm until it was abandoned in 1987.

A gigantic statue of Abraham Lincoln stands in Ashmore. Originally erected in nearby Charleston as a visitor attraction in 1969, the 62-foot statue instead drew widespread ridicule for the cartoonish appearance of its oversized head. A 1978 attempt to sell it to the city of Lincoln was unsuccessful, and it was instead moved to a private site in Ashmore where it fell into a long period of disrepair. New owners eventually converted the site into the Lincoln Springs Resort, and fully restored the statue in 2004 to be the centerpiece of its campgrounds. The site has since reverted to private property again, but the statue remains visible from a distance.

==Transportation==
Coles County Zipline provides dial-a-ride bus transit service to the city. The nearest passenger rail service is at Mattoon station, where Amtrak operates to Chicago, Carbondale, New Orleans, and other destinations.

<text>Charleston is a city in and the county seat of Coles County, Illinois, United States. The population was 17,286, as of the 2020 census. The city is home to Eastern Illinois University and has close ties with its neighbor, Mattoon. Both are principal cities of the Charleston–Mattoon Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Native Americans lived in the Charleston area for thousands of years before the first European settlers arrived. With the great tallgrass prairie to the west, beech-maple forests to the east, and the Embarras River and Wabash Rivers between, the Charleston area provided semi-nomadic Indians access to a variety of resources. Indians may have deliberately set the &quot;wildfires&quot; which maintained the local mosaic of prairie and oak–hickory forest. Streams with names such as &#x27;Indian Creek&#x27; and &#x27;Kickapoo Creek&#x27; mark the sites of former Indian settlements. One village is said to have been located south of Fox Ridge State Park near a deposit of flint.

The early history of settlement in the area was marked by uneasy co-existence between Indians and European settlers. Some settlers lived peacefully with the natives, but conflict arose in the 1810s and 1820s. After Indians allegedly harassed surveying crews, an escalating series of poorly documented skirmishes occurred between Indians, settlers, and the Illinois Rangers. Two pitched battles (complete with cannon on one side) took place just south of Charleston along &quot;the hills of the Embarrass,&quot; near the entrance to Lake Charleston park. These conflicts did not slow American settlement, and Indian history in Coles County effectively ended when all natives were expelled by law from Illinois after the 1832 Black Hawk War. With the grudging exception of Indian wives, the last natives were driven out by the 1840s.

First settled by Benjamin Parker in 1826, Charleston was named for Charles Morton, its first postmaster. The city was established in 1831, but not incorporated until 1865. When Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s father moved to a farm on Goosenest Prairie south of Charleston in 1831, Lincoln helped him move, then left to start his own homestead at New Salem in Sangamon County. Lincoln was a frequent visitor to the Charleston area, though he likely spent more time at the Coles County courthouse than at the home of his father and stepmother. One of the famous Lincoln–Douglas debates was held in Charleston on September 18, 1858, and is now the site of the Coles County fairgrounds and a small museum. Lincoln&#x27;s last visit was in 1859, when the future President visited his stepmother and his father&#x27;s grave.

Although Illinois was a solidly pro-Union, anti-slavery state, Coles County was settled by many Southerners with pro-slavery sentiments. In 1847, the county was divided when prominent local citizens offered refuge to a family of escaped slaves brought from Kentucky by Gen. Robert Matson. Lincoln, by then a young railroad lawyer, appeared in the Coles County Courthouse to argue for the return of the escaped slaves under the Fugitive Slave Act in a case known as Matson v. Ashmore. As in the rest of the nation, this long-simmering debate finally broke out into violence during the American Civil War. On March 28, 1864 a riot —or perhaps a small battle—erupted in downtown Charleston when armed Confederate sympathizers known as Copperheads arrived in town to attack half-drunk Union soldiers preparing to return to their regiment. This is sometimes known as the Charleston Riot.

In 1895, the Eastern Illinois State Normal School was established in Charleston, which later became Eastern Illinois University. This led to lasting resentment in nearby Mattoon, which had originally led the campaign to locate the proposed teaching school in Coles County. A Mattoon newspaper printed a special edition announcing the decision with the derisive headline &quot;Catfish Town Gets It.&quot;

Thomas Lincoln&#x27;s log cabin has been restored and is open to the public as the Lincoln Log Cabin State Historic Site, 8 mi. south of Charleston. The Lincoln farm is maintained as a living history museum where historical re-enactors depict life in 1840s Illinois. Thomas and Sarah Bush Lincoln are buried in the nearby Shiloh Cemetery.

On May 26, 1917, a tornado ripped through Charleston, killing 38 people and injuring many more, along with destroying 220 homes.

<text>Mattoon ( ) is a city in Coles County, Illinois, United States. The population was 16,870 as of the 2020 census. The city is home to Lake Land College and has close ties with its neighbor, Charleston. Both are principal cities of the Charleston–Mattoon Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

===Early history===
One of the main factors determining the settlement of Mattoon and Coles County in general was the topography. Coles County straddled a timberline in the southern half and prairie in the north. The forested areas were primarily fed by two major rivers: the Embarras River in the east and the Kaskaskia in the west. The prairie, known as the &quot;Grand Prairie&quot;, was generally wet and swampy. An early historian described the geography:

&quot;Away from the timber to the north, the face of the country is generally quite level, broken only by long undulations. It is almost entirely prairie land in this part, and was allowed to remain uncultivated until after the opening of the railroads. It was largely used for pasturage during this period, and often presented signs of great animation as the herds of cattle, under the care of their drovers, moved about over its grassy, slightly undulating surface.&quot;

Groves could be found scattered throughout the area. Early settlers to the area started homesteads in the timberline, which provided building materials and fuel. Since the vast majority of early settlers came from wooded areas of Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee (by way of the Ohio and Wabash River valleys), the forests also provided a sense of familiarity.

In 1826, Kentucky émigré Charles Sawyer became the first white man known to settle in the Mattoon area, just north of the timberline (known as the Wabash Point Timber) along the Little Wabash River. Levi Doty built Sawyer&#x27;s cabin while the latter returned to Kentucky to retrieve the rest of his family. Within a year, a few families very quickly settled around Sawyer in the area of Paradise Township, including Dr. John Epperson, the county&#x27;s first physician. Settlers built log cabins using pegs (no iron or nails). &quot;The luxuries of life were generally not seen the first years of the settlement, but appeared as the residents could obtain them.&quot;

Corn was planted and remained a staple crop. Gardens of potatoes and other vegetables were maintained. Hogs, which ran wild in the woods, provided pork, while &quot;deer, bears, wild turkeys, and prairie chickens provided an abundant supply of wild meat.&quot; Wolves proved troublesome to domesticated animals.

The first school was established in 1827–28 in the Paradise Township, taking place in a makeshift cabin and taught by James Waddill. The costs were $2.50-3.00 per student. School was maintained in this location until 1844–45, when the first real schoolhouse was built in what would become Mattoon. That year, the Illinois State Legislature passed its first school laws, making Mattoon a forerunner for early education in the state.

As the population grew, demand for a local government increased. On Christmas Day, 1830, Coles County was established. The county was named after Edward Coles, the second governor in Illinois who served from 1822 to 1826. Settlers in the Mattoon area remained poor and humble, but their community remained close knit.

In 1836, &quot;Old State Road&quot;, which runs along the southern end of town, became one of the first trails to be established in the Mattoon area. Another trail, the Kaskaskia Pass, traveled past what was known as &quot;The Lone Elm Tree&quot;, a natural landmark that helped guide visitors and newcomers. The tree was cut down on August 1, 1950, due to disease. A plaque at the corner of 32nd Street and Western Avenue marks the location of this important landmark.

===1850–1900===

The growth and subsequent history of Mattoon is tied to that of local railroads. In 1854, railroad surveyors from the Illinois Central Railroad and Terre Haute and Alton Railroad found their railroads would cross in the Mattoon area, and a burst of investment and land speculation began. The two railroads raced to the meeting point, on the understanding that the first to arrive would not have to pay to maintain the crossing. The community that had grown in the area of swamp grass and prairie came to be known as &quot;Pegtown&quot;, which referred to the pegs (stakes) used to demarcate lots to be sold at public auction. Among the speculators were Elisha Linder, Ebenezer Noyes, James T. Cunningham, Stephen D. Dole, John L. Allison, and John Cunningham. Land was purchased for $2.50 per acre. On December 12, 1854, County Surveyor John Meadows laid out the town.

The 1850s saw a flurry of activity for the emerging town. In 1855, the first houses were built. Benjamin Turney used 16 yoke of oxen to drag his home from a farm three miles away, while R. H. McFadden built his home near the area of present-day First Street and Prairie Avenue. In May that year, &quot;Pegtown&quot; lots were auctioned. On June 9, 1855, the first train arrived on the Terre Haute Alton Railroad. In July, the Pennsylvania House became the first hotel in town, operating at the present-day 1600 block of Broadway Avenue. That month the first post office was established, with James M. True serving as postmaster. In September, Rev. Isaac Hart performed the town&#x27;s first wedding, marrying Sarah Norvell and R. H. McFadden.

The next year, 1856, saw the creation of the first newspaper. The weekly &quot;Independent Gazette&quot; published four page, seven-column editions. In that same year, the first public school was established (at 1307 Champaign Ave.). In 1856, the first two babies were born in Mattoon, Charles Cartmell in July and Mollie Puff in September. By now, the rapidly growing town had more than 100 buildings. Between 1856 and 1857, the first Baptist, Catholic, Methodist, Christian, and Presbyterian churches were formed.

In May 1857, residents voted to incorporate the town, with 65 votes for and 25 votes against. Also in 1857, ordinances passed forbidding drunkenness, working on Sunday, disturbing public or religious meetings, gaming, leaving carcasses on the streets, littering, obstructing sidewalks, and driving fast horses. In 1858, the first public park was created with a land deed from John Allison and James and John Cunningham. The park remains and is today called Allison–Cunningham Park.

On the night before the fourth Lincoln-Douglas debate of September 18, 1858, at the Coles County Fairgrounds, both Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas slept in nearby Mattoon. Lincoln slept in the Essex House hotel, a popular hotel in those times. He addressed a small crowd from his hotel room. The Essex House, the third brick building in town, opened on the southwest corner of the railroad intersection with Union Station located on the lower story. The Essex House served as hotel, restaurant, and ticket office for both railroads. Later, Ulysses S. Grant would also use the hotel. Today, the mural &quot;Civility&quot; (2009), located in Progress Square, commemorates the arrival of the railroad and depicts the Essex House and both Lincoln and Douglas. &quot;The Lone Elm Tree&quot; occupies the center of the mural.

In 1861, the town was officially named after William B. Mattoon, the chief construction engineer working for the Terre Haute and Alton Railroad and partner of the Massachusetts firm &quot;Phelps, Mattoon, and Barnes.&quot; The reason for the honor is unclear; some say he won the naming rights because his rail crew arrived first. Others say he beat other claimants in a card game, or that Pegtown residents hoped the wealthy Mattoon would invest in the town if they named it after him. With its combination of excellent transportation and remarkably fertile prairie soils, Mattoon expanded rapidly. By the dawn of the 20th century, Mattoon&#x27;s growing population and rail access brought manufacturing and industry.

On June 17, 1861, General Ulysses S. Grant took his first post of the American Civil War when he assumed command of the 21st Illinois Infantry in Mattoon. The flagpole from General Grant&#x27;s camp was preserved and is on display at the Mattoon Public Library.

In 1865, Amish settlers began a community to the north near Arthur. Amish farm stands and horse-drawn buggies are not uncommon sights in the northern part of Mattoon today.

In the 1890s, Mattoon led the successful campaign to have a proposed college in eastern Illinois located in Coles County. The citizens were chagrined when neighboring Charleston was chosen as the home of the future Eastern Illinois University instead.

===20th century===

On May 26, 1917, the town was devastated by an F4 tornado which killed 101 people and injured approximately 638 people. The tornado was Illinois&#x27;s third-deadliest tornado disaster.

In 1932, the Kuehne Manufacturing Co. began producing dinette sets at their new plant on the south side of Mattoon. Its early sets were wooden, but by the 1950s Kuehne was making the chromed metal breakfast-room sets so popular during that decade. The company closed in 1965. Today, Kuehne dinette sets are prized by collectors of mid-century modern furniture. 
The 1940 discovery of petroleum reserves near Mattoon led to a small &quot;oil boom&quot; over the next two decades, bringing with it economic benefits and increased civic pride. Oil extraction continues to be an important economic activity.

Mattoon was the site of the &quot;Mad Gasser&quot; attacks of the 1940s.

In 1966, Lake Land College was built just south of the city. The community college offers degrees for immediate employment and pre-university education.

The Burger King — unrelated to the Florida-based fast food chain Burger King — is a Mattoon restaurant whose owners claim it is the &quot;original&quot; Burger King. In 1968, they sued the national chain Burger King, producing a well-known case in United States trademark law. The federal 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that federal trademark registration has priority over state law, giving the national Burger King chain rights to the name beyond a 20-mile radius around the original Burger King. Today, the closest Burger King franchise location is 25 miles away in Tuscola, Illinois.

Mattoon was home to several minor-league baseball teams in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The last stadium, with about 2,000 seats, was torn down in the late 1950s. Today, the city has a thriving junior league and has hosted many junior league regionals and World Series.

===21st century===
Traditionally a bastion of manufacturing, Mattoon has lost several major plants in the last two decades. On December 18, 2007, the U.S. Department of Energy chose the city as the site of its FutureGen project, a zero-emissions coal-fueled power plant that was to make hydrogen and electricity while using carbon capture and storage. Three years later, the city rejected the proposal after DoE announced its intention to retrofit an existing power plant in Meredosia instead of building a new one in Mattoon.

In 2000, Mattoon native Clyde D. Hood was indicted for the Omega Trust scam, a 1994–95 scam that brought in around $10 million and was one of the largest in U.S. history. Hood and accomplices bought businesses in the Mattoon area, including the Blue Bird Diner, a longtime family favorite in the small town.

The 1986 arrival of the Lender&#x27;s Bagels factory led Mattoon to dub itself the &quot;Bagel Capital of the World.&quot; Home to the world&#x27;s largest bagel, the town holds a weeklong family festival, &quot;Lenders Bagelfest&quot;, at the end of July. The main event is a 3-day weekend festival held in Peterson Park near downtown, featuring food and craft vendors, local organizations, rides such as the Ferris wheel and the Tilt-A-Whirl, and morning community events such as The Big Bagel Breakfast and Bagel Bingo. A beauty pageant crowns winners in various age groups, who ride in the parade held on the Saturday morning of the event. The festival features concerts by local and national musicians. In 2009, Zac Brown Band headlined the festival; others have included Night Ranger, 38 Special, Jason Aldean, The Marshall Tucker Band, Travis Tritt, and Ronnie Milsap. There is also a Christian night featuring contemporary Christian musicians such as Building 429 and Remedy Drive.

General Electric closed since the need for traditional lighting has decreased. The plant opened in the 1940s and has remained a staple ever since. On January 15, 2020, LSC Communications announced they would be closing their Mattoon facility. LSC Communications was Mattoon&#x27;s largest employer. Affiliates of Phoenix Investors purchased LSC.

==Geography==
According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Mattoon has a total area of , of which (or 99.96%) is land and (or 0.04%) is water. Nearby rivers have been dammed to form Lake Paradise and Lake Mattoon south of the city.

The terminal moraine of the Wisconsin Glacier is located just to the south of Mattoon. Heading south on I-57 there is an impressive vista from the top of the moraine at the south Mattoon exit. While the moraine is of Wisconsinan age (about 10,000 years before present), the land to the south is of Illinoian age (about 100,000 years before present). The small oil field to the south of the moraine is also attributed to glacial activity: The weight of the glacier to the north created cracks in the underlying bedrock. Oil collected adjacent to these cracks.

==History==
Oakland, formerly known as Independence, was platted in 1833.

Pioneer doctor and abolitionist Hiram Rutherford moved to Oakland in 1840 to start his practice in the young town. He became a prominent citizen. Rutherford is best known for his involvement in the 1847 Matson Trial, which involved his friend Abraham Lincoln. A Kentucky slave owner, General Robert Matson, annually brought slaves to work on his land near Oakland. One year, a family of slaves ran away from the farm and took refuge with Rutherford and Gideon Ashmore. Matson sued the men for harboring slaves; Rutherford and Ashmore countered that the slaves could not legally be held in a free state. Rutherford attempted to have Lincoln represent him in the case, but Lincoln had already agreed to represent the slave owner. Matson, represented by Lincoln, lost the case in Coles County court.

<text>Alsip is a village in Cook County, Illinois, United States. The population was 19,063 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Chicago metropolitan area.

Alsip was settled in the 1830s by German and Dutch farmers. The village is named after Frank Alsip, the owner of a brickyard that opened there in 1885. The village began to grow after the Tri-State Tollway was built there in 1959.

==Geography==

Alsip is located at (41.670433, -87.732199).

According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Alsip has a total area of , of which (or 98.49%) is land and (or 1.51%) is water.

Alsip is bordered to the west by the villages of Worth and Palos Heights. To the south is Crestwood. Oak Lawn lies to the north. Merrionette Park, Blue Island, and Robbins lie to the east (north-south, respectively). The Mount Greenwood neighborhood of Chicago lies to the north and east.

Most of the town lies to the north of the Cal-Sag Channel. However, Chippewa Ridge subdivision, which was built upon the former Alsip Nursery, lies southwest of the Cal-Sag. In conjunction with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources and the Water Reclamation District of Chicago, the village operates a boat launch on the canal, permitting inland access to Lake Michigan.

The Alsip area is home to two predominantly African-American cemeteries, Burr Oak and Restvale cemeteries, which are the resting places of many Chicago blues musicians (including Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon and Dinah Washington), athletes (Jimmie Crutchfield), and other celebrities. Emmett Till, whose murder in Mississippi at age 14 in 1955 was an important moment in the Civil Rights Movement, is buried at Burr Oak. In 2004, that cemetery was covered in the national media when the murder investigation was re-opened, and Till&#x27;s body was exhumed.

Six years later, on July 9, 2010, Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart alleged that four workers at Burr Oak cemetery dug up more than 200 graves, dumped the bodies into unmarked mass graves, and resold the plots to unsuspecting members of the public. The three men and one woman were charged and convicted with one count each of dismembering a human body.

<text>Arlington Heights is a village in Cook and Lake counties, Illinois, United States. A northwestern suburb of Chicago, it lies about northwest of the city&#x27;s downtown. As of the 2020 census, the village&#x27;s population was 77,676, making it the 15th-most populous municipality in Illinois.

Arlington Heights is known for the former Arlington Park Race Track, home of the Arlington Million, a Breeders&#x27; Cup qualifying event; it also hosted the Breeders&#x27; Cup World Thoroughbred Championships in 2002. The village is also home to the Arlington Heights Memorial Library, which has one of the largest collections of books in the state.

==History==
Arlington Heights lies mostly in the western part of Wheeling Township, with territory in adjacent Elk Grove and Palatine townships, in an area originally notable for the absence of groves and trees.

=== Pre-settlement history ===
The land that is now the Village of Arlington Heights was controlled by the Miami Confederacy (which contained the Illini and Kickapoo tribes) starting in the early 1680s. The Confederacy was driven from the area by the Iroquois and Meskwaki in the early 1700s.

The French-allied Potawatomi began to raid and take possession of Northern Illinois in the 1700s. In the late 1700s and early 1800s, the Potawatomi expanded southwards from their territory in Green Bay and westward from their holdings near Detroit, until they controlled in an L-shaped swath of territory from Green Bay to the Illinois River, and from the Mississippi River to the Maumee River.

Throughout the 1830s, the Potawatomi maintained a camp in modern-day Arlington Heights that was used for six weeks out of the year as the Potawatomi migrated from their summer encampments to their winter encampments.

In 1833, the Potawatomi signed the 1833 Treaty of Chicago with the United States Government. As a result of the Treaty, the United States was granted control of all land west of Lake Michigan and east of Lake Winnebago in exchange for a tract of land west of the Mississippi. The land that is now Arlington Heights was ceded to the U.S. in this treaty, which sparked mass white immigration to the Northern Illinois area. The U.S. Government purchased the land for about 15 cents per acre, and then resold it to white settlers for 1.25 dollars per acre.

The Potawatomi would occasionally return to their holdings in Northern Illinois to honor their buried ancestors, but these return visits ended as old villages and burial sites were destroyed by settlers to make way for farming.

The descendants of the Potawatomi who once inhabited the land that is now Arlington Heights currently live on a reservation in Mayette, Kansas.

=== West Wheeling ===
Many prominent roads in the Arlington Heights area were built on top of Native American trails: Rand Road was built on top of a Native trail which passed by the property of Socrates Rand, who built a tavern near a crossing on the Des Plaines River. Arlington Heights Road was developed from a Native trail that ran from what was once called Naper Settlement (now Naperville) to what was once called Indian Creek (now Half Day).

Around the same time, a trading post was established in the Southwest corner of the township by Frederick T. Miner, the cabins established near Miner&#x27;s trading post came to be known as West Wheeling.

=== Dunton ===
In 1837, Asa Dunton, a settler who built one of the first cabins in what was then known as Deer Grove, registered three land claims for himself and two sons in the land in the west of Wheeling Township.

In 1845, Asa&#x27;s eldest son, William Dunton, married Almeda Wood and brought her to the house he built beside the Potawatomi trail which then became known as Dunton&#x27;s Road (and is now known as Arlington Heights Road). West Wheeling then became known as Dunton. The town&#x27;s name changed several times before it officially became known as Arlington Heights in 1874.

William Dunton persuaded the Illinois &amp; Wisconsin Railroad company to build track through his property. In 1853, Dunton sold 16 acres of his land to the company for $350. The first Dunton train station was built in 1854. The construction of the railroad helped to expand the population of Dunton, as it was easier for settlers to reach the village. 
By 1850, the area had largely changed its ethnic composition, as many German farmers from Saxony had arrived during the 1840s. John Klehm might serve as an example; he was at first a potato farmer, supplying the Chicago market, and in 1856 began a nursery for cherry, apple, and pear trees, later moving into spruce, maple, and elm, and then flowers. By the late 1850s the area had become noted for its truck farms, sending dairy products as well as vegetables to Chicago on the railroad.

During the Civil War, Chicago experienced a population boom, and many migrants moved to villages surrounding Chicago such as Dunton. Dunton also saw an influx of German immigration By the 1870s, Dunton&#x27;s population had surpassed 1200.

=== The Civil War ===
Several Dunton residents served in the Civil War, however only three of those residents who left for the war returned. One of the survivors, a recently naturalized Alsatian named Charles Sigwalt (namesake of Sigwalt Street), fought at the Battle of Chickamauga and the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain.

Warren Kennicott (namesake of Kennicott Avenue) was killed in action at the Battle of Gettysburg.

During the Civil War, Arlington Heights was a stop for many Union soldiers travelling South to fight the Confederacy or traveling North to fight in the Dakota War.

=== Arlington Heights ===
Dunton slowly grew after the Civil War, acquiring a blacksmith, a cheese factory, a hardware store, and a hotel. In 1874, the town&#x27;s name was officially changed to Arlington Heights.

In 1878, Civil War veteran Charles Sigwalt and his brother John founded the Sigwalt Sewing Machine Company, which made 40,000 machines from the period of 1878 to 1883. The company was destroyed by a fire in 1895.

Arlington Heights was an early commuter suburb.

=== Religious heritage ===
The town developed religious institutions that reflected the origins of its citizens. The first churches were Presbyterian (1856) and Methodist (1858), with St. Peter Lutheran Church, a German Lutheran church, following in 1860. Today, the village has many Roman Catholics, boasting three very large churches: St. James (founded 1902—now home to 4,600 registered families), St. Edna (2,800 registered families), and Our Lady of the Wayside (3,100 registered households), in addition to several large Lutheran churches, Evangelicals and several other Protestant churches, including two United Churches of Christ, an Episcopal Church and a Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).

===Arlington Park Racetrack===
By the start of the 20th century Arlington Heights had about 1,400 inhabitants, and it continued to grow slowly with a good many farms and greenhouses after World War II. By then Arlington Heights was also known for Arlington Park, a racetrack founded in 1927 by the California millionaire Harry D. &quot;Curly&quot; Brown upon land formerly consisting of 12 farms. Camp McDonald and two country clubs were founded in the 1930s. On July 31, 1985, a fire burned down the grandstand. The current six-story grandstand was completed and opened for use June 28, 1989.

In February 2021, the track&#x27;s owners, Churchill Downs Inc., announced that they would sell the site for redevelopment, which would draw in many new developers. In June 2021, the Chicago Bears of the National Football League emerged as prospective buyers of Arlington Park, raising speculation that they would leave Soldier Field (their current home stadium in downtown Chicago) and build a new stadium on the site, either alongside or directly atop the track. On September 29, 2021, the Bears and Churchill Downs reached a $197.2 million purchase and sell agreement for the property where the new stadium would be built.

===Population increase===
A population explosion took place in the 1950s and 1960s, when the spread of automobile ownership, together with the expansion of the Chicago-area economy, the baby boom, and white flight from the city, drove the number of people in Arlington Heights—expanded by a series of annexations—up to 64,884 by 1970. By then virtually all the available land had been taken up, and the formerly isolated depot stop found itself part of a continuous built-up area stretching from Lake Michigan to the Fox River.

<text>Barrington is a village in Cook and Lake counties in the U.S. state of Illinois. The population was 10,722 at the 2020 census. A northwest suburb of Chicago, the area features wetlands, forest preserves, parks, and horse trails in a country-suburban setting. Barrington is part of the Chicago metropolitan area.

== History ==

===Early history===
The original settlers of the Barrington area were the indigenous peoples of the Native American Prairie Potawatomi or Mascoutin tribes, which later divided into the Potawatomi, Ojibwe, and Ottawa tribes. Many local roads still in use today, including Algonquin Road, Rand Road, Higgins Road, and St. Charles Road, were originally Native American trails. For many years, Barrington was considered part of the Northwest Territory, then the Illinois Territory.

===19th century===
By treaty dated September 26, 1833, ending the Black Hawk War, the Ojibwe, Ottawa and Potawatomi tribes ceded to the United States all lands from the west shore of Lake Michigan west to the area that the Winnebago tribe ceded in 1832, north to the area that the Menominees had previously ceded to the United States, and south to the area previously ceded by an 1829 treaty at Prairie du Chien, a total of approximately . Through this treaty, the Sauk, Meskwaki, Winnebago, Ojibwe, Ottawa and Pottawatomi tribes ceded all title to the area east of the Mississippi River. Between 1833 and 1835, the U.S. government paid approximately $100,000 in annuities and grants to the Potawatomi, Ottawa, and Ojibwe tribes, presumably as payment for the land.

Following this treaty, pioneers traveled from Troy, New York, via Fort Dearborn (now the city of Chicago) to live in Cuba Township in Lake County. The first white pioneers known to have settled in Barrington township were Jesse F. Miller and William Van Orsdal of Steuben County, New York, who arrived in 1834, before the three-year period which had been given the Native Americans to vacate the region, and before local land surveys. Other Yankee settlers from Vermont and New York settled in what is now the northwest corner of Cook County.

The combined settlement of these pioneers, located at the intersection of Illinois Route 68 and Sutton Road, was originally called Miller Grove due to the number of families with that surname but later renamed Barrington Center because it &quot;centered&quot; both ways from the present Sutton Road and from Algonquin and Higgins roads. Although residents and historians agree that the name Barrington was taken from Great Barrington in Berkshire County, Massachusetts, and that many settlers immigrated to the area from Berkshire County, there is currently no evidence that settlers emigrated from Great Barrington itself. In addition, several original settlers, including Miller, Van Orsdal, and John W. Seymour, emigrated from Steuben County, New York, which also features a town named Barrington founded in 1822. However, it is currently unknown whether any settlers emigrated from Barrington, New York, itself or whether the New York settlement influenced the naming of Barrington, Illinois.

Much of the history of Barrington since its settlement parallels the development of railroad lines from the port facilities in Chicago. In 1854, the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company, now known as the Union Pacific Northwest Line, led by William Butler Ogden, extended the train line to the northwest corner of Cook County and built a station named Deer Grove.

In 1854, Robert Campbell, a civil engineer who worked for the railroad, purchased a farm northwest of the Deer Grove station and platted a community on the property. Deer Grove residents protested, and at Campbell&#x27;s request, the railroad later moved the Deer Grove station near its current location, which Campbell named Barrington after Barrington Center. In 1855, the village&#x27;s first lumber facility began operations on Franklin Street.

By 1863, population growth during the Civil War era increased the number of Barrington residents to 300. In order to provide a tax mechanism to finance improvements, Barrington submitted its request for incorporation in 1863. Delays due to the Civil War resulted in the appropriate incorporation deeds not returning to Barrington for nearly two years. The Illinois legislature granted Barrington&#x27;s charter on February 16, 1865. The Village held its first Board meeting on March 20, 1865, and appointed resident Homer Wilmarth as Mayor for one year.

In 1866, resident Milius B. McIntosh became the first elected Village President.

In 1889, the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway (the &quot;EJ&amp;E&quot;) was built through Barrington, crossing what is now the Union Pacific/Northwest Line northwest of town. In the late 19th century, a series of fires damaged numerous downtown buildings. In 1890, fire swept along the north side of East Main Street east of what is now the Union Pacific/Northwest Line, destroying several buildings. In 1893, another fire destroyed most of the block that is now Park Avenue, and in 1898 a fire destroyed several buildings along the north side of Main Street from Hough Street to the Northwest Line railroad tracks. As a result of these fires, residents replaced the burned frame structures with more substantial brick and stone buildings, many of which remain in use today (albeit with substantially altered facades).

===20th century===
At the beginning of the 20th century, the village streets were unpaved, although the downtown area had wooden slat sidewalks, with some on elevated platforms. The downtown area also featured hitching posts for tethering horses as well as public outhouses. Meanwhile, fenced residential backyards in the village often contained livestock and barnyard animals.

In 1907, the village began replacing its wooden sidewalks with cement pavement. In 1929, the Jewel Tea Company built a new office, warehouse, and coffee roasting facility northeast of the village center, creating hundreds of local jobs despite the Great Depression.

The last major fire in downtown Barrington occurred on December 19, 1989. The fire completely destroyed Lipofsky&#x27;s Department Store, then one of the oldest continually operating businesses in the village.

====The Battle of Barrington====

On November 27, 1934, a running gun battle between FBI agents and Public Enemy # 1 Baby Face Nelson took place in Barrington, resulting in the deaths of Special Agent Herman &quot;Ed&quot; Hollis and Inspector Samuel P. Cowley. Nelson, though shot nine times, escaped the gunfight in Hollis&#x27;s car with his wife, Helen Gillis. Nelson succumbed from his wounds at approximately 8 p.m. that evening and was unceremoniously dumped near a cemetery in Niles Center (now Skokie), Illinois. Infamous for allegedly killing more federal agents than any other individual, Nelson was later buried at Saint Joseph Cemetery in River Grove, Illinois. A plaque near the entrance to Langendorf Park, part of the Barrington Park District, commemorates the agents killed in the gunfight.

===21st century===

In April 2009, in a non-binding referendum, residents voted in favor of permitting Barrington Township officials to begin looking into seceding from Cook County in part due to Cook County&#x27;s increased sales tax, now the highest in the country. (&quot;See&quot; Government section below.) Today, Barrington and its nearby villages are considered to be some of the wealthiest in the country.

====Opposition to Canadian National Railway Purchase of EJ&amp;E Railway====
Since 2008, Barrington has made national news for its opposition to the purchase of the EJ&amp;E by Canadian National Railway, known as &quot;CN&quot;, a purchase that may drastically increase the number of freight trains passing through the village daily. The EJ&amp;E intersects at grade with eight major roads in the Barrington area, including Northwest Highway, Illinois State Route 59 and Lake Cook Road in downtown Barrington, as well as the Metra Union Pacific line. By 2012, CN is expected to run at least 20 trains on the line per day. In summer 2008, Barack Obama, then a U.S. senator for Illinois, voiced opposition to the purchase, vowing to work with affected communities to make sure their views were considered.

On October 15, 2010, the CN railroad crossing at U.S. Route 14, as well as rail crossings at Lake Zurich Road and Cuba Road, were blocked for over one and half hours during the early afternoon rush hour due to a stopped 133-car CN southeast bound freight train. At times during the incident, the Hough Street crossing was also blocked. The stopped train also caused back-ups on the Metra commuter rail service of their &quot;Union Pacific Northwest Line&quot;, which operates over Union Pacific&#x27;s Harvard and McHenry subdivisions. That same day, U.S. Rep. Melissa Bean (D-8th) and U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) released a statement that Barrington will receive a $2.8 million grant to fund the planning, design and engineering of a grade separation at the U.S. Route 14 and CN railroad crossing. Construction of any grade separation at that intersection is estimated to cost approximately $69 million; the source(s) of any such funding are currently unknown, and there are currently no plans to design or construct grade separations at any of the other seven Barrington area CN railroad crossings.

The Village of Barrington Historic District was established in 2001 to protect and preserve historical areas of the Village and
individual structures and sites within this area which have historic, architectural or cultural significance. Barrington&#x27;s Historic Preservation Overlay District is noted for its Victorian, Victorian Gothic, Queen Anne, and other popular late-19th century forms of architecture. Among Barrington&#x27;s notable buildings is the Octagon House, also known as the Hawley House. Claimed to be built around 1860, although the oldest home in Barrington Village is on North Avenue dating to 1872, the Octagon House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places; although initially a residence, it now serves as a commercial property.

The downtown area is home to the historic Catlow Theater, which features interiors by noted Prairie School sculptor and designer Alfonso Iannelli. In May 1927, the Catlow Theater opened for business with &quot;Slide, Kelly, Slide&quot; as its first feature film. The Catlow is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places and continues to operate as one of the few remaining single-screen theaters in the area. The Catlow was one of the first theaters to offer in-theater dining, provided by the adjoining Showtime Eatery. Patrons may bring food from Showtime Eatery (formerly Boloney&#x27;s) into the 526-seat auditorium.

Another historic building in the village, the Ice House Mall, is located just northwest of the town&#x27;s center. Originally built in 1904 for the Bowman Dairy, the brick structure, with its turn of the 20th century styling, served as an actual ice house for 68 years. Renovations and additions beginning in the 1970s have transformed the original building into a collection of local specialty shops.

==Parks and recreation==
The Barrington area features numerous parks and nature preserves.

<text>Barrington Hills is a village located about northwest of Chicago in the U.S. state of Illinois. Per the 2020 census, the population was 4,114. It straddles approximately over four counties, Cook, Kane, Lake, and McHenry. The Village of Barrington Hills was incorporated in 1957.

The suburban village is included in the greater Barrington area. Many very affluent residents live on large estates and commute to downtown Chicago. A minimum zoning restriction has been in effect on new construction since 1963, but the existence of equestrian farms antedates the village by decades. Farming and horse raising are allowed. 
Barrington Hills includes farms and estates such as &quot;Hill &#x27;N Dale Farms&quot;, which was owned by Richard L. Duchossois, former owner of the Arlington Park racetrack. It was acquired by Citizens for Conservation in 2022 CFC plans to restore the original countours of Spring Creek as well as wetlands and prairies. Another example of an estate is &quot;Bank Note Farm&quot;. The identification of the area with horses carries over to the names Broncos and Colts for school teams.

==History==

===Barrington Center Church===

Barrington Center Church was built in 1853 by the Barrington Methodist Episcopal Society. A memorial plaque outside the church lists 91 area residents - one woman and 90 men - who served in the Civil War. Since the 1980s, the church building has been used by a Korean-American congregation, the New Friends Wesleyan Church.

In 1860, about 18 immigrant families of Czech ancestry settled along the east side of the Fox River, near the future site of Fox River Grove. In 1867, land was purchased at the southwest corner of Church and River - Algonquin roads, and construction was started on St. John Nepomucene Chapel, named after the patron saint of Bohemia. Completed in 1873, the chapel was never served by its own priest, and currently services are scheduled only once a year. The chapel and its cemetery are owned by the St. John Nepomucene Catholic Cemetery Association, making it the only privately owned Catholic chapel and cemetery in the Rockford Diocese.

===Railroad and gentleman farms===
Starting about 1900, business executives from Chicago, many of whom were tied to the railroad industry, purchased the rolling farms and subdivided them into large summer estates. One such individual was Spencer C. Otis Sr., who by 1910 is credited with purchasing of farmland along what was then Goose Lake Road but is now known as Otis Road and creating Hawthorne Farm. Otis was a &quot;gentleman farmer&quot; of the era. He worked in Chicago commerce, but his hobby was dairy farming on his large country estate which was led by his son Spencer Otis Jr. who attended agricultural school in at the University of Illinois in Urbana. At this time the university was experimenting building round barns, of which became an Otis signature, as there were three built on the Hawthorne Farm. Several of Otis Senior&#x27;s business associates, including George E. Van Hagen, also built large estates in the area and ran their summer homes as year-round dairy farms.

===Barrington Hills Country Club===
In 1921, the Barrington Hills Country Club, with its eighteen-hole golf course, was established on of unfarmable land between County Line Road, Oak Knoll Road, and Northwest Highway. The land was donated by three of the club&#x27;s early founders: H. Stillson Hart, who owned the farmstead known as Hart Hills just to the east of the club; George E. Van Hagen of Wakefield Farm, who owned the land just to the west of the club; and J.R. Cardwell, whose Oak Knoll Farm swelled along the winding Oak Knoll Road on the club&#x27;s northern end. Van Hagen became the club&#x27;s first president. Noted Chicago architect Robert Work, who was associated with David Adler, designed the first clubhouse, which was opened in 1926 and burned to the ground in 1930. Work designed the second clubhouse as well, which opened in 1931 and still stands.
==Education==
The only public school located in the village is Countryside Elementary School, with about 500 students, in grades K-5, in the Barrington Community Unit School District 220. Countryside Elementary School draws students from both Barrington Hills and the eastern half of Fox River Grove which falls into District 220 also. Students from Countryside either attend Barrington Prairie Middle School or Barrington Station Middle School Station. Older students attend the nearby Barrington High School. Portions of the village are also within CUSD 300 of Dundee-Crown High School and of the Cary-Grove High School district.

<text>Bellwood is a village in Proviso Township, Cook County, Illinois, United States. Located west of Chicago&#x27;s downtown Loop, the Village of Bellwood is bounded by the Eisenhower Expressway (south), the Proviso yards of the former Chicago &amp; Northwestern, now Union Pacific Railroad (north), and the suburbs of Maywood (east) and Hillside and Berkeley (west). The population was 18,789 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Bellwood was incorporated on May 21, 1900. The municipality took its name from one of the village&#x27;s early subdivisions, &quot;Bellewood&quot;. However, in later years, the final &quot;e&quot; was dropped.
The region, which was mostly flat grassland, was initially mostly farmland. A few businesses, including a few taverns, were drawn to the initial subdivision. In reaction to dry Maywood&#x27;s effort to annex the area, businesses that served alcohol petitioned for incorporation. Between 1900 and 1930, Bellwood&#x27;s population numbers increased steadily. By 1920, the village&#x27;s population of 943 had more than quadrupled, with many German and Russian immigrants. The increase to 4,991 persons in 1930 is due to the annexation of territory west of Mannheim Road in 1926, as well as ongoing migration.

The Chicago, Aurora and Elgin Railway and the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway provided rail passenger service, which promoted residential growth in neighboring portions of Bellwood. The 1970s saw racial upheaval and inclusion in a Supreme Court case in the United States. Bellwood sued a local real estate company in 1975, alleging racial discrimination. Four years later, the Supreme Court issued a historic decision allowing governments to utilize testers and sue when discrimination occurs. The black population of Bellwood jumped from 1.1 percent in 1970 to 35 percent in 1980 and 70 percent in 1990.

A few major firms exist in Bellwood today, but the collapse of many other large sectors has resulted in a decrease in employment and tax revenue. Despite these contributions, the community saw some new development as a result of various minor industrial and commercial organizations.

==Geography==
According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Bellwood has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census there were 18,789 people, 6,059 households, and 4,310 families residing in the village. The population density was . There were 6,757 housing units at an average density of .

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 26.79% of the population.

There were 6,059 households, out of which 36.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 38.54% were married couples living together, 26.18% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.87% were non-families. 27.03% of all households were made up of individuals, and 12.44% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.79 and the average family size was 3.09.

The village&#x27;s age distribution consisted of 23.7% under the age of 18, 8.9% from 18 to 24, 27.8% from 25 to 44, 25.5% from 45 to 64, and 14.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36.1 years. For every 100 females, there were 84.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 77.3 males.

The median income for a household in the village was $63,006, and the median income for a family was $69,730. Males had a median income of $38,361 versus $32,466 for females. The per capita income for the village was $27,244. About 8.3% of families and 11.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 13.1% of those under age 18 and 12.3% of those age 65 or over.

In November 2011, Union Pacific Railroad announced plans to renovate and upgrade Bellwood&#x27;s Metra station and add a third rail line. The project, estimated at $4 million, was expected to be completed by the fall of 2012 at no cost to residents.
Bellwood formerly had a station on the Chicago Great Western Railway main line before it was abandoned in 1968 by the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway. The Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad runs through Bellwood, but does not host any commuter rail traffic.

<text>Berkeley (pronounced &quot;BURK-lee&quot;) is a village in Cook County, Illinois, United States. Incorporated in 1924, the population at the 2020 census was 5,338.

The town has a commuter railroad station on Metra&#x27;s Union Pacific West Line with service to downtown Chicago.

Berkeley is situated fourteen miles west of the Chicago Loop in Cook County. Berkeley is on the western edge of Cook County. Berkeley has instant access to the metropolitan area, with Interstates 290 and 294 comprising its western and part of its southern boundaries, and the Union Pacific Railroad (originally the Chicago &amp; North Western) and the large Proviso classification yard to the north. However, the transit arteries that link Berkeley to separate locations also function to isolate the village from its close neighbors, providing it a small-town atmosphere.

==Geography==
Berkeley is located at (41.886794, -87.910528).

According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Berkeley has a total area of , all land.

==History==

Farmers, mostly of German and Dutch heritage, began to settle in the region that would become Berkeley around 1835. The Dutch sought to be truck farmers, dwelling on farms spanning from 40 to 160 acres, whereas the Germans conducted general farming. In 1848, a small group of farm families founded Sunnyside, a one-room school. Sunnyside Elementary School is still in operation today, however it is now located in a bigger and newer structure. 

Farmland was provided for what is now known as Old Settler&#x27;s Cemetery a short distance west on St. Charles Road (which was finished in 1836). Many of the area&#x27;s earliest settlers remain buried there.

The Chicago, Aurora &amp; Elgin Railroad (interurban) opened in 1902, providing the area with its first passenger rail service at Berkeley. Subdivisions were made in 1908 and again in 1914-1915 introduced new residential building and new inhabitants to the region, who were mostly English. Berkeley became a village in 1924, thanks to the efforts of these people.

The early 1900s population surge paled in comparison to the post-World War II population explosion in Berkeley, which saw the village population triple from 1,882 in 1950 to 5,792 in 1960. Berkeley also lost a number of homes when the Interstate 290 expansion was built in the late 1950s, cutting a north–south swath across the village&#x27;s western part. The Chicago, Aurora &amp; Elgin Railway ceased passenger service in 1957 when traffic was transferred to the new expressway system, but its path is still preserved through the community by the Prairie Path for bicyclists.

Berkeley bought property from the railroad in the 1960s to stretch its northern borders, enabling for the development of a small industrial park. Electrical contractors, printing firms, warehouses, wholesalers, and the World Dryer Corporation, one of the world&#x27;s largest hand dryer manufacturers, were among the facility&#x27;s 12 light industries in 2000. Berkeley, on the other hand, has remained mostly a residential neighborhood. Many of the residents who bought houses in the village in the 1950s stayed into the 1990s. The village anticipated large residential turnover when these long-term homeowners sold their homes at the turn of the twenty-first century.

==Demographics==

<doc id="110948" wikidata="Q578072" url="?curid=110948" title="Berwyn, Illinois">
<text>Berwyn () is a suburban city in Cook County, Illinois, United States, coterminous with Berwyn Township, which was formed in 1908 after breaking off from Cicero Township. As of the 2020 census, the city had a total population of 57,250. It is part of the Chicago metropolitan area.

==History==
Before being settled, the land that is now Berwyn was traversed by Native American trails. The most important trails converged near the Chicago portage, and two notable routes crossed what is today Berwyn. A branch of the Trail to Green Bay crossed Berwyn at what is now Riverside Drive, and the Ottawa Trail spanned the southern end of the city.

In 1846, the first land in &quot;Berwyn&quot; was deeded to Theodore Doty, who built the Plank Road from Chicago to Ottawa along the Ottawa Trail. The trail had been used as a French and Indian trade route and more recently as a stagecoach route to Lisle. This thoroughfare became what is now Ogden Avenue in South Berwyn. In 1856, Thomas F. Baldwin purchased of land, bordered by what is now Ogden Avenue, Ridgeland Avenue, 31st Street, and Harlem Avenue, in hopes of developing a rich and aristocratic community called &quot;LaVergne&quot;. However, few people were interested in grassy marshland. Mud Lake extended nearly to the southern border of today&#x27;s Berwyn, and the land regularly flooded during heavy rains. The only mode of transportation to LaVergne was horse and buggy on the Plank Road.

To encourage people to move to LaVergne, Baldwin sold an strip of property to the Burlington and Quincy Railroad in 1862. The rail line opened in 1864, but the train did not stop regularly in the area. The railroad refused to build a station, so the residents of the area constructed LaVergne Station on Ridgeland Avenue in 1874.

However, the financial panic of 1873 and Baldwin&#x27;s death in 1876 stunted the growth of LaVergne. Baldwin&#x27;s daughter, Emma, inherited her father&#x27;s estate, and in 1879 she sold most of the land to a group of realtors controlled by Marshall Field. The new development enacted building codes and stipulated the minimum building cost of each home. By the end of 1880, 12 new homes were built. By 1888, the settlement had grown so much that the Baldwin family donated the triangular piece of land bounded by Ogden Avenue, 34th Street, and Gunderson Avenue so that a school could be built. LaVergne School became the first public building in Berwyn.

In 1890, Charles E. Piper and Wilbur J. Andrews, two Chicago attorneys, purchased a plot of land from the Field syndicate to develop. The land was bounded by Wesley, Kenilworth, 31st Street, and Ogden Avenues. By the following year, the two received approval from Cicero Township to double their land holdings.

Piper and Andrews wanted the railroad to build a station in their development, but the railroad already had stations at La Vergne and at Harlem Avenue. Piper and Andrews decided to build a station with the understanding that trains would stop regularly. They did not know what to name their station so they consulted a Pennsylvania train timetable to find a name. They chose to name it after Berwyn, Pennsylvania, a Main Line suburb of Philadelphia noted for its beauty. After 1901, all settlements in the area were known as Berwyn.

While Piper and Andrews were developing the southern portion of present-day Berwyn, John Kelly was helping to develop the north part from 12th Street to 16th Street. This area was really a part of an Oak Park subdivision, and it even appeared on some maps as &quot;South Oak Park&quot;. In fact, children who lived in this area went to school in Oak Park. John Kelly was known as &quot;Mr. Everything&quot; because he was a realtor, builder, insurance seller, and community servant.

In between the two settlements, there was little except for a few farms. The area between 16th and 31st streets was not settled. There were only two paths by which to travel between the two settlements, and today these paths are known as Oak Park Avenue and Ridgeland Avenue. Although Berwyn was chartered as a city in 1908, it was not until the 1920s that this middle portion of land was developed.

During this time, Berwyn was the area&#x27;s fastest growing suburb. The city&#x27;s stringent building codes resulted in block upon block of well-built brick two-story bungalows. Many also contained elaborate design elements typically not seen, such as stained glass windows, clay tile roofs, terra cotta, and intricate brick patterns. Today, Berwyn is noted as having the most significant collection of Chicago-style bungalows in the nation.

==Demographics==

==Geography==
According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Berwyn has a total area of , all land. Bordering cities include Oak Park to the north, Cicero to the east, Stickney to the south, Lyons, Riverside, North Riverside, and Forest Park to the west. Geologically, Berwyn is predominately composed of Glacial Lake Bottom from the Wisconsin Glacial Episode, the most recent glacial period. A beach ridge of sand and gravel, made during one of the stages of Lake Chicago, is also present in the city. This is most easily identified as Riverside Drive. The elevation change due to the ridge is clearly seen on the 2800 block of Maple Ave. Prior to the settlement of Berwyn, the land was grassy marshland. The body of water that connected the South Branch of the Chicago River to the Des Plaines River was a shallow waterway or a muddy slough (depending on the season) known as Mud Lake. Mud Lake extended nearly to the southern border of today&#x27;s Berwyn, and the southern end of Berwyn flooded regularly during heavy rains in its early years.

==Government==
=== City ===
The City of Berwyn operates under a Mayor–council government form of government. The people of Berwyn elect the mayor, clerk, treasurer, and one alderman from each of the city&#x27;s eight wards. The terms of elected officials are four years. The mayor is given administrative authority, and he has the power to appoint and remove all officers of the municipality, except those covered by civil service. The City Council, composed of the eight aldermen and the mayor, is the legislative organ of the city.

The seat of government is located at City Hall, 6700 26th Street.

=== Police and fire departments ===
==== Police ====
The Berwyn Police Department has six main divisions: Administrative, Investigative, Patrol, K-9 Unit, Communications, Records, and Parking. The Berwyn Police Station is located at 6401 W. 31st Street.

==== Fire ====
The Berwyn Fire Department is composed of 80 sworn professional firefighters, 30 certified paramedics, and 11 emergency medical technicians. The Fire Department is anchored by three fire stations with the following equipment:
=== Federal ===
Since 2013, Berwyn has been split between three of Illinois&#x27; congressional districts: the , , and .

=== Post Office ===
The United States Postal Service operates the Berwyn Post Office (1940), at 6625 Cermak Road. The post office contains a mural, &quot;The Picnic&quot;, painted in 1942 by Richard Haines. Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department.

==Education==
Berwyn is served by two K-8 school districts:

*Berwyn North School District 98 comprises 4 schools: Havlicek Elementary, Prairie Oak Elementary, Jefferson Elementary, and Lincoln Middle School.
*Berwyn South School District 100 comprises 8 schools: Emerson Elementary, Hiawatha Elementary, Irving Elementary, Komensky Elementary, Pershing Elementary, Piper Elementary, Freedom Middle School, and Heritage Middle School.

High school students, depending on residency, attend either J. Sterling Morton High School District 201&#x27;s J. Sterling Morton High School West in Berwyn or J. Sterling Morton High School East in Cicero. Most areas are west of Ridgeland Avenue and therefore are zoned to Morton West, while those east of Ridgeland Avenue are zoned to Morton East.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago operates one PK-8 school in Berwyn, St. Leonard School. St. Odilo closed in 2024. St. Mary of Celle closed after the 2004–2005 school year. The building and premises are still used, however. During the Great Depression, the tuition at St. Odilo was only 75 cents (about $ when accounting for inflation).

Parochial grade school students who wish to move onto parochial secondary education can attend nearby schools such as Fenwick High School in neighboring Oak Park, or Nazareth Academy in La Grange Park, both of which are co-educational. Trinity High School located in River Forest is a school for girls.

Berwyn North School District 98 used to host General Custer Elementary, which was built in 1908 and later torn down in 2000. In 2002, a new state-of-the-art school was built on the same site called Prairie Oak Elementary. Emerson Elementary and Heritage Middle School share a common wall, but are separate schools. When Lincoln Middle School was built in 1928, it never had a cafeteria or library, the library was across the street (now the Berwyn Cultural Center).

LaVergne School, built in 1888, was the first school built in Berwyn, the building had two classrooms with fireplaces. Despite community protest, the 50-year-old building was torn down in 1938. It was replaced with the Lavergne Education Centre which, once an elementary school, is now the headquarters of the Berwyn South School District 100.

==Economy==

While Berwyn is known as the &quot;City of Homes,&quot; it also contains four primary business corridors: Ogden Ave, the Depot District, Cermak Road, and Roosevelt Road. Ogden Ave, a segment of historic Route 66, is an automobile-centered district, and at its peak the road included over a dozen car dealerships in Berwyn. The Depot District, the area around the train station, includes an array of independent shops and restaurants. Loyola MacNeal Hospital, founded in 1919, is the largest employer in the city and the center of the district. Cermak Road earned the nickname &quot;The Bohemian Wall Street&quot; due to the many savings and loans located there. In 1991, the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; reported that &quot;Berwyn has the highest concentration of financial institutions in the world - a tribute to the frugality of its forebears.&quot;

The Cermak Plaza Shopping Center, which opened in 1956, is located at the corner of Harlem Avenue and Cermak Road. Notable original tenants included J. C. Penney, Walgreens, F.W. Woolworth, Kinney Shoes, Jewel Foods and Fannie May Candies. Cermak Plaza served as the main shopping center for the area until 1975 when the North Riverside Park Mall opened a half mile west on Cermak Road. Cermak Road now includes an array of retail shops and restaurants. 

According to Berwyn&#x27;s 2013 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city were:

== Transportation ==

=== Train ===

Berwyn is served by the BNSF Line, and Metra operates three stations within the city: Harlem Avenue station, Berwyn Station at Oak Park Ave, and La Vergne station at Ridgeland Ave.

Until 1952 Berwyn was served by the Douglas branch of the Chicago &quot;L&quot;. The line was extended in 1924 to Oak Park Ave, just north of Cermak Rd. In 1952 rail service west of 54th Ave was suspended and replaced by bus. The fairways that once served as the right of way for the &quot;L&quot; still exist as parking lots for shopping along the Cermak avenue corridor.

Berwyn was also briefly served by a steam line that ran along 19th Street at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. A station was located at Ridgeland Ave. The line was built in 1890 by the Chicago and Northern Pacific Railroad under the name Chicago &amp; Southwestern Railroad. It extended from the C&amp;NP mainline at 45th Street south to 16th Street and then to 19th Street. It then turned north on Harlem, returning to the C&amp;NP mainline. The different shaped lots between Austin Blvd and Ridgeland along 19th Street attest to the previous presence of the line.

=== Bus ===
Bus service within Berwyn and to neighboring suburbs is primarily provided by Pace Bus. Additionally, CTA Route 21 serves Cermak Road through Berwyn.

=== Walkability and carbon footprint ===
Berwyn residents may be able to lead a low carbon footprint lifestyle, according to &quot;The Five Ton Life&quot;. This is due to walkable neighborhoods of modestly sized bungalows, and easy access to grocery stores.

== Arts and culture ==
Berwyn now has a growing arts community with a professional equity theater, an Arts Council and music and entertainment venues. The 16th Street Theater producing live events opened in 2007. It was named &quot;Best Emerging Theater Company&quot; by Chicago magazine in 2013.

=== Annual events ===
From the 1920s to the 1970s, Berwyn had a large Czechoslovak population, and to celebrate their heritage the Houby Day Parade was organized in 1968. The parade continues to today, and it coincides with the fall mushroom harvest.

Ogden Avenue is part of the &quot;Historic Route 66&quot; in Berwyn, and an annual Vintage Car Show has taken place in the city every year in early September since 1990. Ogden Avenue is closed to traffic from Ridgeland to Oak Park Avenue, and hundreds of car enthusiasts come out to celebrate the spirit of Route 66. In 2006, Berwyn began to host its annual art car parade called Cartopia. Art car artists from all over the country meet to show off their latest creations and then parade through the neighborhood.

In the 1960s and 1970s, many Italian families moved into Berwyn. The Maria SS Lauretana Italian-Sicilian Religious Festival was held on the grounds of Morton West High School during Labor Day weekend until 2014.

Since the year 2000, Berwyn has held an Oktoberfest and Brew Fest around mid to late-September; the festivals are held at the tracks on Berwyn Station and Proska Park respectively.

=== Public art ===
Berwyn was notable for the sculpture &quot;Spindle&quot;, created by artist Dustin Shuler and located in the Cermak Plaza shopping center along with other works of art. The Spindle was shown in the 1992 film &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;. It was demolished and scrapped on the night of May 2, 2008 to make way for a new Walgreens. Grassroots efforts to Save the Spindle failed to raise the $300,000+ that it would have taken to dismantle and relocate it. This was a major upset among supporters of the sculpture, considering that it did not encroach upon the new Walgreens&#x27; final location. The two topmost cars were placed in storage; the Berwyn Route 66 Museum on Ogden Avenue proposes to incorporate them into a reconstruction of the Spindle.

Beginning 2019, the city has cooperated with a non-profit known as the Berwyn Public Art Initiative to provide opportunities for independent artists to create public art throughout the city.

=== Film and television ===
Portions of the 2008 film &quot;Wanted&quot; with Angelina Jolie were filmed at Cermak Plaza. Segments of the films &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;, &quot;The Color of Money&quot;, and &quot;Adventures in Babysitting&quot; were filmed at FitzGerald&#x27;s Nightclub in Berwyn.

Berwyn is mentioned frequently as a running gag on the Chicago television series &quot;Svengoolie&quot;, using a voice clip of multiple people shouting, &quot;Berwyn?!&quot; This is often complimented by jokes poking fun at the town&#x27;s historically Central European heritage, or digs at the local culture of Berwyn. These jokes continued in another Rich Koz project, &quot;The Koz Zone&quot;.

In the 2023 film Late Night With The Devil, Berwyn is referenced as a nod to Svengoolie.

Berwyn has also been used as the backdrop for multiple television productions, such as shows in the Dick Wolf &quot;Chicago&quot; franchise, &quot;The Chi&quot;, and &quot;Empire&quot;.

== Parks and recreation ==

Many parks and community centers are located within Berwyn. Two park districts and a recreation department maintain the city&#x27;s recreational facilities and organize leagues and programming for youth, adults, and seniors. The city&#x27;s largest park is Proksa Park, which comprises approximately of land. It contains numerous flower beds, 64 species of trees, 85 species of shrubs, as well as a small pond and stream. Recreational facilities include three tennis courts, two softball fields, and a large playground.

Berwyn is also home to the Pav YMCA. In 1987, the YMCA opened at 2947 Oak Park Ave, on the former site of a lumber yard that had burned down a decade earlier. The building has an Olympic-sized indoor pool, racquet and handball courts, a gym, and exercise facilities. A rehabilitation center operated in conjunction with MacNeal Memorial Hospital is present as well.

The following table includes a complete list of Berwyn&#x27;s public parks and recreational centers:

==Features==
Berwyn is a very diverse community, with some larger homes on its south side and many smaller, bungalow-type homes on the north side around Roosevelt Road and Cermak Road. The town also has many duplexes and three unit buildings. Because of the predominance of small residences in Berwyn, the community has an unusually low carbon footprint. According to data published by the Center for Neighborhood Technology, Berwyn had the lowest per capita CO2 emissions from homes and private vehicles in the Chicago area.

Berwyn has one of the world&#x27;s largest laundromats, in size, with 161 washers and 140 dryers, a kids&#x27; play area, big screen TVs, a bird sanctuary, and free pizza on Wednesday nights. It incurred extensive damage from an electrical fire in 2004 but was rebuilt in early 2006. This laundromat received considerable recognition for using a solar thermal system (the largest such installation in Illinois) to meet its hot water needs.

<doc id="110949" wikidata="Q577829" url="?curid=110949" title="Blue Island, Illinois">
<text>Blue Island is a city in Cook County, Illinois, United States, located approximately south of Chicago&#x27;s Loop. Blue Island is adjacent to the city of Chicago and shares its northern boundary with that city&#x27;s Morgan Park neighborhood. The population was 22,558 at the 2020 United States Census.

Blue Island was established in the 1830s as a way station for settlers traveling on the Vincennes Trace, and the settlement prospered because it was conveniently situated a day&#x27;s journey outside of Chicago. The late-nineteenth-century historian and publisher Alfred T. Andreas made the following observation regarding the appearance of the young community in &quot;History of Cook County Illinois&quot; (1884), &quot;The location of Blue Island Village is a beautiful one. Nowhere about Chicago is there to be found a more pleasant and desirable resident locality.&quot;

Since its founding, the city has been an important commercial center in the south Cook County region, although its position in that respect has been eclipsed in recent years as other significant population centers developed around it and the region&#x27;s commercial resources became spread over a wider area. In addition to its broad long-standing industrial base, the city enjoyed notable growth in the 1840s during the construction of the feeder canal (now the Calumet Sag Channel) for the Illinois and Michigan Canal and as the center of a large brick-making industry beginning in the 1850s, which eventually gave Blue Island the status of brick-making capital of the world. Beginning in 1883, Blue Island was also host to the car shops of the Rock Island Railroad. Blue Island was home to several breweries, who used the east side of the hill to store their product before the advent of refrigeration, until the Eighteenth Amendment made these breweries illegal in 1919. A large regional hospital and two major clinics are also located in the city.

Although initially settled by &quot;Yankee&quot; stock, Blue Island has been the point of entry for many of America&#x27;s immigrants, beginning in the 1840s with the arrival of a large German population that remained a prominent part of the city&#x27;s ethnic makeup for many years. By 1850, half of Blue Island&#x27;s population was either foreign-born or the children of foreign-born residents. Later, significant groups came from Italy, Poland, Sweden and Mexico.

The city is one of eleven incorporated areas in Illinois to have been designated by the White House as a &quot;Preserve America&quot; community.

==History==
===Uptown===

Norman Rexford came to Chicago from Charlotte, Vermont in 1835 and in 1836 became the first permanent settler of Blue Island when he established the Blue Island House near the intersection of present-day Western Avenue and Gregory Street just north of the Western Avenue bridge. Before Rexford built the Blue Island House he had constructed a four-room log cabin in the wilderness at the north end of the Blue Island ridge that he intended as a tavern for wayfarers, but after a year realized that the place was not likely to be profitable for him and began to look for another site where he might have more success. Although farther from Fort Dearborn and the settlement at Chicago (which by that time was incorporated and had a population of several thousand persons) by about , the new inn was better situated because it was located on the Wabash Road (in Blue Island now Western Avenue), which was then a part of the Vincennes trail that went from Chicago to Vincennes, Indiana. It was considerably larger and more refined than Rexford&#x27;s previous venture, being a two-and-a half-story white frame building that also had various outbuildings to accommodate the needs of his guests. Because it was a day&#x27;s journey from Chicago, within a few years the inn became the nucleus for a group of businesses that catered to the soldiers, cattlemen (with their herds) and other travelers who arrived by stagecoach or otherwise frequented the Vincennes trail. Events hosted by the inn frequently lasted until the small hours of the morning, requiring an overnight stay before guests returned the next morning to their homes and places of business in Chicago and the hinterland.

Through the 1970s, Blue Island&#x27;s central business district (&quot;uptown&quot; to the locals) was regarded as an important regional commercial center, with stores such as Woolworth&#x27;s, Kline&#x27;s, Sears, Montgomery Ward, Spiegel and Steak &#x27;n Shake. Today, downtown Blue Island is better known for its antique stores, art galleries, ethnic delicatessens and fine dining. Much of this shift in business activity has been brought on by &quot;big box&quot; development outside of town that space constraints make it impossible for uptown to accommodate. However, several local businesses have served the area for generations: DeMar&#x27;s Restaurant, for example, opened its doors in 1950; Jebens Hardware was established in 1876; and Krueger Funeral Home was founded in 1858. In the 21st century, the city and a dedicated group of volunteers, working with the Metropolitan Planning Council of Chicago and the Center for Neighborhood Technology devised the &quot;Blue Island Plan for Economic Development&quot;, which addresses not only the commercial expansion of the historic uptown business district, but also the continued improvement of the housing stock and industrial base.

The Blue Island Opera House was built by Blue Island&#x27;s first mayor John L. Zacharias to replace the Robinson Block, which was destroyed by the Great Blue Island Fire of that year. The opera house was host to vaudeville and repertoire shows until 1913, when it became the Grand Theater and a venue for motion pictures. In later years the building was home to the Blue Island &quot;Sun-Standard&quot; newspaper and Kline&#x27;s Department Store. Although the auditorium has been remodeled out of existence, the building, with its award-winning exterior restoration, today provides both commercial and office space to the historic &quot;uptown&quot; district. The building has been designated as a landmark by the Blue Island Historic Preservation Commission It was designed by the American/Canadian architect Hugh Griffith Jones, who also designed Blue Island&#x27;s first Greenwood School (demolished) and a commercial building with a flat above (c. 1895, extant, also now a city landmark) for Albert and Emma Schmidt at 312 (now 13022) Western Avenue. The architect&#x27;s drawings for the opera house were used by Jones in the package he prepared to justify his successful application for membership in the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada.

Moraine Valley Community College operates a satellite facility uptown.

===The Blue Island Market===
For many years on the first Thursday of every month, Western Avenue south of the canal and to the city limits on 139th Street was host to an open-air market, the Blue Island Market, more commonly known as Market Day. The market was a place where farmers from a wide area surrounding Blue Island came to town to sell their wares to each other and to the public at large. As the postcard image to the right shows, items offered included produce, farm equipment, and livestock, with a local band thrown in to provide entertainment. Market Day began sometime in the last quarter of the 19th century and lasted until May 1924, when it was closed by the city council after a gradual influx of peddlers offering shoddy merchandise discouraged farmer participation and the market was deemed a public nuisance.

===Brickyards===
After it was discovered in the early 1850s that rich deposits of clay surrounded the ridge, Blue Island became the center of a significant brick-making industry that lasted for over a century. In the early years, these efforts were small, with the bricks being made by hand and the turnout created mostly for local use, but by 1886 the Illinois Pressed Brick Company (organized in 1884) was employing about 80 men and using &quot;steam power and the most approved machinery&quot;, which allowed them to produce 50,000 bricks per day. By 1900, the Clifton Brickyard alone—which had opened in 1883 under the name of Purington at the far northeast corner of the village—was producing 150,000,000 bricks a year. In 1886, the Chicago architectural firm of Adler and Sullivan designed a large complex for the Wahl Brothers brickyard (the main building of which was ) on the west side of the Grand Trunk tracks south of 123rd street. These buildings had been demolished by 1935, and all of Blue Island&#x27;s brickyards were re-purposed by the latter part of the mid-20th century. The larger ones for a while become landfills, and the Wahl Brothers location is now the site of the Meadows Golf Club.

===The Portland question===
Some sources state that the city of Blue Island was once officially (or commonly) known as Portland. This claim is erroneous.

*Norman Rexford became the community&#x27;s first permanent resident when he established the &quot;Blue Island House&quot; at the southern edge of the ridge in November 1836, where in 1838 he became the settlement&#x27;s first postmaster. In his reminiscences published in the Blue Island &quot;Standard&quot; in 1876, Heber Rexford (who first came to the area in 1834 and was Cook County treasurer at the time of the Great Chicago Fire in 1871) related the following:

&quot;The north end of the bench of land on which Blue Island stands was originally covered with a dense forest, and from Chicago, before the view was obstructed by buildings, this timber presented a blue appearance like smoke. Water was like-mirrored forth by the mirage which almost always prevailed, giving the timber the appearance of land surrounded by water, and it was from this circumstance that the hunters called it Blue Island, which name was perpetuated by my brother getting a Post Office located there, which was also called Blue Island – so much for the name.&quot;
*On April 13, 1839, Peter Barton and his partners (who included Gurdon Hubbard and John H. Kinzie) registered the plat of &quot;Portland&quot; with the state of Illinois. Portland had been laid out on land purchased from the federal government adjacent to the settlement of Blue Island which was situated south of Vermont Street (more or less) and east of Wabash Road (what is now Western Avenue uptown, again, more or less). The Little Calumet River ran through the center of the platted area, and its promoters felt with this advantage that it would become a prosperous river town. They used their influence to have the local post office name changed from Blue Island to Portland (a circumstance that as time went by would be a source of aggravation to the people of Blue Island), and on May 1, 1839, this was accomplished. The post office, however, wasn&#x27;t located within the platted area of Portland since there were no buildings in which to operate it, but in fact was on contiguous property to the west at the Blue Island House. Portland was never incorporated – it existed for many years by and large only as a plat of survey. No buildings of any consequence were erected there for nearly half a century. While some of the street names from Portland remain (although sometimes not entirely on their original courses), any of them that &quot;were&quot; laid out (and in fact a majority of them never were) waited in most cases for many years until they were needed. About half of the area was eventually annexed within what would become the corporate boundaries of Blue Island as time went by, and significant other sections of it became parts of the villages of Calumet Park and Riverdale, the Joe Louis the Champ golf course, and unincorporated Calumet Township. According to John Volp, whose family had lived in Blue Island since 1862:

&quot;&#x27;Portland&#x27; did not become a river town. Neither did the name &#x27;Portland&#x27; ever come into general use. In spite of all the efforts of its promoters to popularize the locality the people preferred to live on top of the hill and call the place &#x27;Blue Island&#x27;...&quot;
*For reasons that remain unclear (but most likely because all of the development that was taking place in the area was occurring in the as yet unincorporated settlement of Blue Island to the north and west), the state legislature changed the name of the platted &quot;town&quot; of Portland to correspond with that of its neighbor. From the &quot;Laws of Illinois – 1842 and 1843&quot;:

&quot;An Act entitled AN ACT TO CHANGE THE NAME OF PORTLAND IN COOK COUNTY TO THE NAME OF BLUE ISLAND: Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, represented in the General Assembly that the name of the place called Portland in Cook County, Illinois is hereby altered and changed to Blue Island and the same shall hereafter always be known and called by such name of Blue Island. Approved February 24, 1843.&quot; At the same time, the post office department in Washington, D.C. changed the name of the post office to &quot;Blue Island&quot;. In the 1903 edition of &quot;Blue Book for the State of Illinois&quot;, the state shows 1843 as the year Blue Island was granted &quot;incorporation under special acts&quot;, recognizing the existence of Portland, but not as an incorporated entity. (Blue Island would not officially incorporate for almost another three decades – see below.)
*On April 20, 1850, the post office name was changed to &quot;Worth&quot;, this time to coincide with the name of the township in which it was located.
*The Rock Island Railroad inaugurated service to the community in 1852. From the Chicago &quot;Journal&quot;, May 27, 1852:

&quot;The work of laying ties upon this Road (sic) between Chicago and Blue Island will be commenced next week. Mr. H. Fuller... will complete the work in the course of ten or fifteen days. Two hundred and thirty-six men are now employed on it.&quot; 
:The &quot;Rocket&quot;, as the train was called, pulled into the Vermont Street station (the only one in town then) for the first time on October 10, 1852. The Rock Island called the station &quot;Blue Island&quot;.
*On January 10, 1860, the post office name reverted again to &quot;Blue Island&quot;.
*On October 26, 1872, Blue Island incorporated as a village using the name by which it has always been known. Although about twenty percent of Portland was included within the corporate boundaries of the new village, that Portland was not an incorporated entity can be determined from the following excerpt that was taken from the petition that was submitted to the state to permit the election to consider incorporation: &quot;... Your petitioners further represent that the territory herein described and bounded is not more than two (2) square miles, and that no part of the same is now included within the limits of any incorporated town, Village or City ...&quot;

===Historic buildings and structures===

Bertrand Goldberg designed the Dr. Aaron Heimbach House (1939). The house is one of only six surviving residential designs by the architect, and is a designated landmark in the City of Blue Island. In 2009, its owners received the Richard H. Driehaus Foundation Preservation Award from Landmarks Illinois for the outstanding quality of the restoration work performed on the house during the previous four years.

Because of its long history, the built environment of Blue Island exhibits a broad range of architectural styles and periods. Although largely built in the vernacular tradition, the works of notable architects, including Adler and Sullivan, George Maher, August Fiedler, Oscar Wenderoth, Robert Seyfarth, Perkins and Will, and Bertrand Goldberg, are featured throughout the community.

The Bell/Hendriks house was designed and construction in 1947 for the Prize Homes competition which was sponsored and promoted by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, and several thousand persons toured the &quot;modified Colonial&quot; home when it was built, with many of the visitors&#x27; comments reported in the newspaper during the month the house was open to the public for tours. Opening ceremonies were broadcast over WGN radio, and plans of the house and of the other twenty-three prize-winning designs from the competition were the subject of an exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago the previous year.

The oldest section of Blue Island&#x27;s city hall, built in 1891, was designed by Edmund R. Krause, who was the architect of the Majestic Building (along with its recently restored Bank of America Theatre) in Chicago&#x27;s Loop The first buildings of Northwest Gas, Light and Coke Company in Blue Island were designed by Holabird &amp; Roche in 1902 (demolished). The city also has 22 houses known to have been built with mail-order kits sold by Sears Modern Homes. There is one building in Blue Island listed on the National Register of Historic Places, 27 are included as part of the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency&#x27;s Historic Architectural and Archaeology Resources Geographic Information System, and 41 individual buildings and one district have been designated as local landmarks by the Blue Island Historic Preservation Commission. The city&#x27;s newest development is Fay&#x27;s Point, a gated community built at the confluence of the Calumet River and the Calumet Sag Channel on the site of the home of Jerome Fay, who had settled there in 1850.

The Libby, McNeill and Libby Building, which operated as Libby, McNeill and Libby&#x27;s main Midwest processing plant from 1918 to 1968, is a prominent historic remnant of Blue Island&#x27;s industrial heritage, located three blocks south of downtown Blue Island on Western Avenue.

====The American House====
One of the oldest buildings in Blue Island, the American House was built in 1839 as the courthouse for Lake County, Indiana—a function it never actually had the chance to serve, as the county seat was moved from Liverpool to Crown Point in 1840. In 1844, the building was disassembled, sent by raft up the Little Calumet River, and reassembled in Blue Island.

The building originally stood on the west side of Western Avenue north of Vermont Street, (where Three Sisters Antique Mall stands today). It was popular among Southerners who used it as a summer boarding house and with the contractors who built the feeder canal for the Illinois and Michigan Canal. After the Civil War it was used as a home for retired soldiers. Although it was built after the invention of balloon framing, the building is constructed using the timber framing method, evidence of which is still clearly visible in the basement and attic. However, while its Greek Revival roots are discernible, the building is much remodeled and serves today as a private residence.

Greek Revival was the architectural style of choice in the early years of Blue Island&#x27;s history. Many of the buildings that remain from those days have been similarly remodeled, but some of the most well-preserved examples of the style, albeit in a vernacular form, can be seen either in the Walter P. Roche House on York Street or the Henry Schuemann House on Western Avenue.

====The Joshua P. Young House====

An ad appeared in the book &quot;Chicago and Its Suburbs&quot;, which was published in 1874 in part to promote the interests of real estate developers in the Chicago area. Note the mention of the firm&#x27;s holdings in Englewood, South Lawn (later Harvey), Homewood and Washington Heights (later Morgan Park), the latter of which was purchased in 1869 for $150 per acre from the tract that was then being developed by the Blue Island Land and Building Co.

The house was built by Carlton Wadhams (1810–1891), who came to Blue Island in 1839 from Goshen, Connecticut, and farmed on land north of the village until he opened the American House Hotel (building extant) in 1844. During his time in Blue Island, Wadhams made his first fortune as the owner of the hotel and as a cattle dealer, staying until c. 1857 when he sold his holdings and moved to South Bend, Indiana. In South Bend he was one of the founders of the Dodge Manufacturing Company and of the First National Bank, where he was a director until his death. Wadhams sold the house along with all of the property on which it was located, which included the American House and all of the land between what is today Western Avenue, Maple Avenue, Burr Oak Avenue and Vermont Street to Joshua Palmer Young (1818–1889), who, by himself beginning in 1848 and in a partnership with John K. Rowley that was established in 1866, played an important role in the development of the Chicago communities of Beverly Hills, Morgan Park, Near West Side, Washington Heights and Englewood, as well as the suburban communities of Blue Island, South Lawn (now Harvey), Homewood and South Holland.

Young operated the hotel for a time and was otherwise active in local affairs. He served from 1878–1880 as the president of the village board, and was a founder of the Congregational church (now Christ Memorial United Church of Christ). He was one of the incorporators, a director and secretary of the Chicago, Blue Island and Indiana Railroad Company (now part of the Grand Trunk Railway), whose charter was approved by the state of Illinois on March 7, 1867.

The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is included in the State of Illinois&#x27; Historic Architectural and Archaeology Resources Geographic Information System.

====USS &quot;Blue Island Victory&quot;====
On December 28, 1944, 91 days after her keel was laid, the USS &quot;Blue Island Victory&quot; was launched from the Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard in Baltimore, Maryland. Dubbed &quot;the Ugly Duckling of the merchant marine&quot; by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Victory ships were armed cargo ships that were built during World War II to transport troops and supplies wherever in the world their services were required. Of the 550 or so built, 218 were named after American cities.

The USS &quot;Blue Island Victory&quot; was a type VC 2-S-AP2, which was long, wide, and had a draft. It was equipped with a gun on the stern for enemy submarines, a anti-aircraft gun, and a 20 mm cannon. The &quot;Blue Island Victory&quot; served variously as a troop ship and as a cattle transport ship, and saw service in the Korean War. It was scrapped in 1972.

====City hall====
The oldest portion of Blue Island&#x27;s city hall was built in 1891 and designed by Edmund R. Krause, a prominent Chicago architect who among other buildings designed the 20-story Majestic Theatre building in Chicago&#x27;s Loop at what is now 22 W. Monroe Street (the theater, whose interiors were designed by Rapp and Rapp, has been renamed several time in the last fifty years – most recently in 2015 when it became the PrivateBank Theatre). An annex to city hall was built in 1925 according to plans by the Chicago architectural firm of Doerr, Lindquist and Doerr. The design for the annex was apparently a conscious effort to complement the post office building across the street and built using similar brick and a closely related architectural style, although not on as grand a scale. The Blue Island Post Office was designed by Oscar Wenderoth and built in 1914. Wenderoth was associated with the building of many government buildings of the period, including the Senate and House Office Buildings in Washington, D.C.

Beginning in the 1870s, the water supply for Blue Island was supplied by three artesian wells, whose water was pumped by a windmill to a storage tank that sat on top of a high stone tower behind the City Hall building. The city began to receive its water from Lake Michigan in August 1915 after the water from the wells began to acquire a gaseous odor whose source was apparently the Public Service Company whose facilities were located about a quarter mile to the southwest, and the tank was subsequently removed.

=== Religion ===

Although religious gatherings have taken place in Blue Island almost since the community was founded in 1836, the first denominational services took place in 1850 with the founding of the Central Methodist Church (predecessor to today&#x27;s Grace United Methodist Church). Blue Island continues to respect the tradition of its early settlers by maintaining many of the congregations that were established there during these early years, and also by hosting new places of worship that serve the needs of new residents of this culturally diverse community.

=== Etymology ===

The north-central section of the city of Blue Island is located at the south end of a glacial moraine that once was an island when the waters from Lake Chicago covered the surrounding area at the former lake&#x27;s Glenwood Stage. Early pioneers gave the ridge the name because at a distance it looked like an island set in a trackless prairie sea. The blue color was attributed to atmospheric scattering or to blue flowers growing on the ridge. The Chicago &quot;Democrat&quot;, February, 1834 described it:

&quot;Nearly south of this town and twelve miles [19 km] distant is Blue Island. This name is particularly appropriate. It is a table of land about six miles [10 km] long and an average of two miles [3.2 km] wide, of an oval form and rising some forty feet [12 m] out of an immense plain which surrounds it on every side. The sides and slopes of this table, as well as the table itself, are covered with a handsome growth of timber, forming a belt surrounding about four or five thousand acres of beautiful table land. In summer, the plain is covered with luxurious herbage. It is uninhabited, and when we visited it, from its stillness, loneliness, and quiet, we pronounced it a vast vegetable solitude. The ridge, when viewed from a distance, appears standing in an azure mist of vapor, hence the appellation &#x27;Blue Island&#x27;.&quot;
== Geography ==
According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Blue Island has a total area of , of which (or 97.93%) is land and (or 2.07%) is water.

====Blue Island Area Sports Hall of Fame====
As part of its focus, the park district serves the needs of the community by sponsoring Little League Baseball, football, softball and other sports activities. It is also host to the Blue Island Area Sports Hall of Fame, which was sponsored by the Blue Island &quot;Sun Standard&quot; and founded by its sports editor, Don Rizzs. As part of a community that is heavily involved in sports on many levels, the Hall of Fame is a repository of photos and biographies of many individuals who have distinguished themselves on the playing field, both on the local level and in the international spotlight.

== Parks and recreation ==

The park district was formed in 1909 and in 1912 acquired the property of the late Benjamin Sanders, who was Blue Island&#x27;s first village president when the village incorporated in 1872 and served as the chairman of the building committee of the Cook County Board after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. The property was laid out by the Chicago engineer V.B. Roberts with architectural work by A.R. Grosse and included Sanders&#x27; home, which was remodeled into a field house and also provided living quarters for the park&#x27;s superintendent. Central Park eventually offered tennis courts, playground equipment, and the community&#x27;s first swimming pool. It was vacated by the park district in 1965 when St. Francis Hospital acquired the property for $325,000. () to build its east campus there.

Memorial Park, the city&#x27;s next public park, was dedicated on Decoration Day (now Memorial Day), 1922, in ceremonies that were presided over by Brigadier General Abel Davis of Glencoe, Illinois. The section of Memorial Park running adjacent to Burr Oak Avenue with of frontage on Highland Avenue had originally been laid out as a cemetery in the early 1850s, when this section of Blue Island was a long walk from the populated section of the town. Although the cemetery was added to and improved in subsequent years, it was closed by village ordinance in 1898, and almost all of the remains interred there were moved to Mt. Greenwood Cemetery in Chicago, which had been developed by citizens from Blue Island. The acquisition of the entire parcel bounded by Burr Oak Avenue, Highland Avenue, Walnut Street and the B &amp; O tracks was completed by the park district in 1935. The park at that point had reached its present size of , and eventually, with the help of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Alphabet agencies, was provided with landscaping and acquired an outdoor swimming pool, playground equipment, and an Art Deco stadium that seated 1,000 persons (demolished in December 2009). With the closing of Central Park, Memorial Park has become the flagship of the Blue Island park system.

The site of Centennial Park on the east side of Blue Island was acquired from the East Side Development Association in 1935 for $11,500 (). This park provides a field house, athletic fields and playground equipment.

The city operates the Meadows Golf Club, a , 18-hole golf course that was designed by J. Porter Gibson and opened in 1994.

== Government ==

Nearly all of Blue Island is in Illinois&#x27;s 1st congressional district; the portion east of Interstate 57 is in the 2nd district.

== Education ==
As the largest settlement in the southern part of Cook County in the middle of the nineteenth century, Blue Island was an important trading and cultural center. The village offered educational opportunity to its residents as early as 1845 in the form of a private school for girls that was operated by local citizens, and public education was introduced in 1846 with the construction of a one-room schoolhouse that served the community exclusively for that purpose until the first Whittier School was built in 1854. The one-room schoolhouse was repurposed several times in subsequent years and still stands, much remodeled, as a comfortable house on Greenwood Avenue.

Blue Island hosted a number of educational conferences during the 1850s, and because of this (and through the influence of Benjamin Sanders, whose tenure with the Cook County Board was during that time) Chicago State University was founded in Blue Island in 1867 as the Cook County Normal (or Teacher&#x27;s) School in the classrooms of the old Whittier School building on Vermont Street. This arrangement lasted until 1870, when the new campus for the college was completed in what is now the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago on of land that was donated by L. W. Beck for the purpose in 1868.

The public school district as a legal entity (now Cook County School District 130) was established in 1887, and the current high school district (Community High School District 218) was created in 1927, replacing earlier versions from 1897 and 1903. Blue Island Community High School (now Dwight D. Eisenhower High School) was accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools (now North Central Association – Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement) in 1899. As president of Columbia University, Eisenhower was the keynote speaker at the dedication of the new facility on Sacramento Avenue for Blue Island Community High School in 1951, and the building was renamed in his honor in 1962.

A portion of Blue Island is within the Posen-Robbins School District 143½.

=== Elementary and middle schools ===
Most residents of Blue Island live within the boundaries of Cook County School District 130. The grade school district serves not only Blue Island, but also much of Crestwood, some of Robbins and a fraction of Alsip. Residents in the far Southeast of the city have students who attend Calumet Public School District 132. There are no schools from District 132 within the Blue Island boundary.

In 1903, a high school district, separate from District 130 was voted into law by the IL state legislature. For many years (at least until 1938), the superintendent of the high school district was the same for District 130; their school boundaries being virtually identical (the only difference being the inclusion of a cemetery in the high school district!). In August 1927, the Blue Island Community High School District 218 was established. In 1916, there were 250 pupils at Seymour School who were following the high school curriculum. By 1927, the population had grown to 428 pupils despite the fact that the school was built to accommodate 250 students maximum.

There are no active private high schools in the Blue Island community, although the Mother of Sorrows High School for Girls operated from 1954 through 1983. It was run by sisters from the order of the Servants of Mary (Mantellates). There was an attached grade school that served both boys and girls and had a boarding option for students who lived there full time. Most students were boarders.

==Infrastructure==
=== Transportation ===

====Public transportation====
The city is a hub for Metra trains, with six stations, four of them along the Rock Island District line: 119th Street, 123rd Street, Prairie Street, and Vermont Street.

The Rock Island District line splits at Gresham, northeast of Blue Island, and the branch, known alternately as the &quot;Beverly&quot;, &quot;Blue Island&quot;, or &quot;Suburban&quot; branch, serves the Chicago communities of Gresham, Beverly Hills, and Morgan Park. The Rock Island District uses the stations in Blue Island between 119th Street to the north and Vermont Street, where the tracks rejoin the main line, to the south. The branch line was built in 1888 as a result of efforts by the Blue Island Land and Building Company to promote its interests in what was to become the town, and eventually, the Chicago neighborhood of Morgan Park.

The Vermont Street station—which is one of the oldest in the Metra network, having been built in 1868—is across the street from the fifth station, which serves as the terminus of a Metra Electric (formerly the Illinois Central) spur line. This depot was witness to national history in a series of events that began on June 29, 1894, when rioting broke out in the Blue Island yards of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad after an appearance by the president of the American Railway Union, Eugene Debs, who had given a speech that day in support of the striking workers of the Pullman Palace Car Company in Pullman, Illinois, four miles (6 km) to the east. During the riot several buildings were set on fire and a locomotive was knocked off the tracks. After numerous incidents in Blue Island and elsewhere that continued through July 2, President Grover Cleveland responded by sending federal troops to Illinois to maintain the peace and to ensure the safe delivery of the mail. Troops arrived in Blue Island on July 4 and remained for several days. The sixth station, also on the electric line, is a half mile north on Burr Oak Avenue (127th Street) and Lincoln Avenue.

Blue Island is also served by Pace Suburban Bus.

====Other transportation====
Blue Island is from O&#x27;Hare International Airport and from Midway International Airport. It is located a half mile west of Interstate 57, one and a half miles east of the Tri-State Tollway, and is bisected by Western Avenue, which in Blue Island is part of the historic Dixie Highway that in its heyday connected Chicago with Miami, Florida.

=== Public library ===
A lending library has been in existence in some form or another in Blue Island since about 1845, when Thomas McClintock began to make his private library of about 100 volumes available to the public for a nominal fee. The founding of the library as a publicly supported institution dates to 1854, when the library&#x27;s collection, which at this time numbered around 800 volumes, was housed in the new Whittier School building on Vermont Street. The library expanded again in 1890 when the Current Topics Club, predecessor to the Blue Island Woman&#x27;s Club, opened a small reading room above Edward Seyfarth&#x27;s hardware store on Western Avenue with a collection of about 1,500 books and various periodicals which were acquired with funds that were donated by the community through public subscription. Except for what was in the hands of patrons, this library&#x27;s collection was destroyed by the Great Blue Island Fire of 1896.

The public library as a taxpayer-supported institution was founded in 1897, and the first building built in Blue Island expressly for the purpose of housing the library&#x27;s collection (by this time up to 3,200 volumes) was made possible by a matching grant of $15,000 () provided by Andrew Carnegie in 1903. This building was demolished in 1969 when the current library, which opened housing the library&#x27;s collection of over 70,000 volumes, was built. Today, the Blue Island Public Library provides a host of services, including multi-language reading materials, computers with internet access, public meeting rooms and a wide variety of educational programs.
The library is a member of the Reaching Across Illinois Library System and is host to the Blue Island Historical Society&#x27;s award-winning Museum Room.

=== Health care ===
Blue Island was for many years home to St. Francis Hospital and its successor MetroSouth Medical Center, long nationally recognized as one of the nation&#x27;s premier cardiovascular primary care centers. The hospital was founded as Saint Francis Hospital in 1905 by the Sisters of St. Mary (currently the Franciscan Sisters of Mary). They had purchased the home of the late Ernst Uhlich in 1905 for $30,000 () and updated its systems to outfit the building for its new purpose. At the time, this section of Gregory Street was lined with churches and the homes of some of Blue Island&#x27;s more prosperous citizens. The facility was outgrown immediately, and within a few weeks of opening plans were being drawn up to add additional rooms and a laundry so that the hospital could accommodate up to 30 patients. A major addition was added in 1916, at which time the house was converted to office space. It was demolished in 1948 to allow room for the next addition.

The Sisters of St. Mary relinquished ownership of the facility to MetroSouth Medical Center on July 30, 2008. In 2014, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked MetroSouth as one among the top 25 percent of hospitals in the Chicago metropolitan region and among the top 15 percent in the state of Illinois.
Citing &quot;low patient volume&quot; the hospital was closed in 2019.

The campus of the former hospital occupies about in the heart of Blue Island&#x27;s uptown commercial business district.

==In popular culture==
=== Writers and literature ===
Over the years, Blue Island has provided the setting for the works of at least a couple of writers. In 1935, for example, the Chicago playwright and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Margaret Ayer Barnes (1886-–1967) wrote the novel &quot;Edna, His Wife, an American Idyll&quot;, using Blue Island as the first locale of the four that make up her story (the other three being Chicago, Washington, D.C., and New York City). The book chronicles the life of the title character who spent her formative years in Blue Island but leaves after she marries, becoming increasingly unhappy as she leads a more sophisticated life elsewhere while &quot;...remain[ing] a Blue Island girl at heart.&quot; The book was later adapted into a one-woman play by Cornelia Otis Skinner, and her opening night performance of it at the Harris Theater was enthusiastically received by Chicago society, which was pleased to &quot;...have a chance to see a Chicago play in a Chicago theater...&quot;

Twelve years later, &quot;Gus the Great&quot;, the Book of the Month Club selection for September 1947, was published. The book was a runaway best seller, and its author, Thomas W. Duncan, is reputed to have earned $250,000 () in royalties from it, including $100,000 () from Universal Studios for the movie rights. It is the story of the life and adventures of Gus Burgoyne, a circus owner of questionable character. Duncan was a college friend of Hill Lakin, the editor of the Blue Island &quot;Sun-Standard&quot;, and, after a visit to the town&#x27;s industrial section, he was inspired to use it for several scenes for his book.

=== Music ===
Because of the wide popularity of performers such as W. C. Handy, the blues became a popular musical genre during the Roaring Twenties. It is not surprising, then, that when Wendell Hall, Harry Geise and Emory O&#x27;Hara were looking for a title for their 1923 composition, they hit upon the name &quot;Blue Island Blues&quot; The sheet music for it was published that year by Waterson, Berlin &amp; Snyder Co. Described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; art critic John S. Wilson as a &quot;striking and colorful original composition&quot;, it is a plaintive love song about a man who is missing his girl and &quot;...has a ticket to Chicago...&quot; that will be used to help him &quot;... lose – those Yesterday&#x27;s – Blue Island Blues&quot;. It was performed in 1923 by Hall with The Virginians on the Victor Talking Machine Company (now RCA Records) record label and again in 1929 by Tiny Parham. An instrumental version is currently available on the CD by George Shearing and Brian Torff entitled &quot;Lullaby of Birdland: Blues Alley Jazz/On a Clear Day&quot; which was released by Concord Records in 2000.

=== Television and film ===

This layout is from a 1911 Sanborn map Founded in 1856 as the Busch and Brandt brewery and consolidated with United Breweries in 1898, this was one of four such establishments that operated in Blue Island for many years. The long narrow building marked &quot;Stable in Bst&quot; was afterwards owned by the Klein Elevator Co., who used it until c.1990, at which time it was demolished.

Because of its picturesque nature, Blue Island has been used for location shots in several movies and television series:

<text>Bridgeview is a village in Cook County, Illinois, United States. It is located approximately southwest of the Chicago Loop. As of the 2020 census, the village population was 17,027.

==History==
The earliest European settlement in Bridgeview occurred in the 1830s, when the area was still populated by Native American groups. By the 1870s German and Italian settlers began moving into the area for farming purposes. Dutch migrated to the area by the 1920s, at which time farming began to decline; real estate and industry began to develop the area considerably. After Lake Michigan water became available to the area, the population grew significantly. The Bridgeview Community Club was founded in 1938 and became the center of local activities.

The first Palestinians arrived in the 1890s and by 2024, an area between Midway International Airport and a SeatGeek soccer stadium was home to &quot;&quot;, the largest Palestinian enclave in the United States.

Bridgeview was incorporated in 1947 with an initial population of approximately 500 residents. Local residents chose the name &quot;Bridgeview&quot; by one vote over &quot;Oketo&quot;, which remains a street name in the village today. The term &quot;Bridgeview&quot; connotes views of the area from the Harlem Avenue bridge, 79th Street bridge and 87th Street bridge.

Arab Americans are a growing presence, making up 10.8 percent of the population in 2020. In 1981, an Islamic social club was established and by 1984 it had become a mosque. Two Islamic schools in Bridgeview educate hundreds of students from K-12.

Bridgeview&#x27;s motto is &quot;A Well Balanced Community&quot;, as the village&#x27;s zoning is divided equally into residential, commercial, and industrial areas. Its proximity to Chicago&#x27;s Midway Airport and downtown, along with access to major highways, has made it a crossroads of the inner southwest suburbs.

<text>Brookfield (formerly Grossdale) is a village in Cook County, Illinois, United States, located west of downtown Chicago. Per the 2020 census, the population was 19,476. The city is home to the Brookfield Zoo.

==History==
Before 1803, the area now called Brookfield was mostly covered by prairie grasses, forests, and farms. Large portions of the area were inhabited by the Native Americans who long ago developed agriculture and corn cultivation, built villages and burial mounds, invented the bow and arrow, and made beautiful pottery.
Settlement of the village dates to 1889 when Samuel Eberly Gross, a Chicago lawyer turned real estate investor, began selling building lots plotted from farms and woodlands he had acquired along both sides of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad line, which provided passenger and freight service between Chicago and Aurora, Illinois. &quot;Grossdale&quot;, as his development was originally called, offered suburban living at prices affordable to working-class families.

The first two buildings Gross erected were a train station south of the tracks at what is now Prairie Avenue, and a pavilion across the tracks. The original train station was moved across the tracks and a few hundred feet east in 1981, and is now the home of the village&#x27;s historical society and museum, as well as listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The pavilion housed the first post office, general store, Gross&#x27; real estate office, meeting rooms, and eventually a dance hall. Gross offered free train outings from Chicago to Grossdale where the prospects were met at the station by a band and treated to a picnic lunch, with a sales pitch from Gross. In addition to parcels of land, he had a number of house designs to offer at &quot;cheap&quot; prices.

Gross later added the subdivisions of Hollywood (1893) and West Grossdale (1895), each with its own train station. Residents voted to incorporate as the village of Grossdale in 1893. The name was changed in 1905 after residents became displeased with Gross, whose personal life and fortune had floundered. A contest to choose a new name yielded &quot;Brookfield&quot; in respect for Salt Creek, which runs through the area. Gross also has a school named after him called S.E. Gross.

In 1920, the old Plank Toll Road, now called Ogden Avenue (US Hwy 34), was paved, providing easy automobile access to and from Chicago.

The Chicago Zoological Park, commonly called the Brookfield Zoo, opened in 1934. The zoo is located on land given to the Forest Preserve District by Edith Rockefeller McCormick in 1919.

<text>Buffalo Grove is a village in Lake and Cook Counties in the U.S. state of Illinois. A suburb of Chicago, it lies about northwest of Downtown Chicago and north of O&#x27;Hare International Airport. As of the 2020 Census, Buffalo Grove has a population of 43,212. It totals of land, with the top three-quarters in Lake County and the bottom quarter in Cook County. Roads in the village such as Lake Cook Road and Illinois Route 83 converge on I-294. It is part of the Chicago Metropolitan Area.

Before European colonization, Native American Potawatomi tribes inhabited the present area. The name &quot;Buffalo Grove&quot; comes from the English translation of the Potawatomi name for Buffalo Creek, which flows through some of the village. Initial Homesteaders sold their land to agricultural Catholic German immigrants, who established St. Mary&#x27;s Church and a school. The area remained small and rural and character until housing developers began building single-family houses after the Korean War. After being incorporated in 1958, Buffalo Grove experienced a population boom for the rest of the 20th century. The village hosted a 50th Anniversary Celebration in 2008.

The village features dozens of recreational facilities, parks, and festivals, including a months-long Farmers&#x27; market, two golf courses, and the popular &quot;Buffalo Grove Days&quot;. Buffalo Grove has an elected council-manager government with home rule status. The local government&#x27;s public works department is nationally accredited. Economically, residents work in health care, education, and professional services, while businesses in the village employ 20,000 daytime workers in 10 million square feet of commercial and industrial space. The population of the village has been stagnant since the early 2000s.

==History==
===Prior to incorporation===
The first inhabitants of the region were the Illinois Confederation; they comprised multiple tribes and mainly lived in central Illinois. Throughout the 1700s, the Iroquois, Potawatomi, and others invaded and eventually destroyed the confederation. The Potawatomi&#x27;s success led them to inhabit areas near the present Buffalo Grove until 1833. Being the dominant group, the Potawatomi would frequently be involved in the conflicts between Europeans, such as the Beaver Wars. The first Europeans to stay the winter in what would become Chicago were the French Jesuit explorers Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet in 1673; they established trade relations with the Ojibwe. They were traveling west to find the mouth of the Mississippi River to map its entirety and to spread Christianity.

Consistent with Native American history in the United States, the tribes in Illinois were devastated by decades of war, diseases, and the ever-encroaching American settlers. The settlers caused a dwindling of food and game; in 1829, a group of Illinois River Potawatomi signed a land cession treaty that included what would become Lake County in exchange for annual delivery of $12,000 in cash and 50 barrels of salt, $12,000 in gifts, and an exclusive blacksmith shop for them. The Native Americans&#x27; efforts to remain on their land failed because of the pressure of westward migration, aided by the recent opening of the Erie Canal. They signed the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which ceded all their lands in Illinois and Wisconsin and opened the area to white settlement. Some Native Americans who left the area would move onto reservations in western Missouri and Kansas, while others went north into Canada or resettled in northern Michigan and Wisconsin.

The first white settler in Vernon Township was Daniel Wright, who arrived in 1833 and established a cabin and crops with the help of remaining natives. The first settlers in Buffalo Grove were homesteaders from New England who received land grants from the government. They stayed for five years and sold their land to Catholic German immigrants fleeing poor living conditions. The primarily agricultural immigrants subsequently established the St. Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church and St. Mary&#x27;s School in the 1850s; they still stand today. Buffalo Grove expanded throughout the 19th century with the additions of the first school (St. Mary&#x27;s School), the Firnbach Tavern, and the Weidner General Store. The General Store served many purposes in the town, such as the post office, train ticket office, polling place, and first town telephone. Before World War II, Buffalo Grove was entirely rural, consisting of less than 150 people, mostly dairy farmers.

===Incorporation and post-incorporation===
All farmers eventually sold their land to developers like Al Frank, president of Buffalo Grove Home Builders Inc., who started developing his 100-acre purchase in the 1950s for World War II and Korean War veterans. The demand for single-family homes near Chicago led to a wave of &quot;suburban settlers&quot; in Buffalo Grove; they lived in Frank&#x27;s 1,000 square foot homes. Frank was instrumental in Buffalo Grove&#x27;s incorporation in 1958 because he successfully recruited many people; incidentally, most of them were related to him or working for him. He had wanted to incorporate Buffalo Grove to remove his development from Cook County city planners. The incorporated population was 164 people. The incorporation led to a population increase in Buffalo Grove, and as more developers came, the village annexed more land. Organization quickly commenced as the government created a plan commission and parks and recreation commission. Meanwhile, the government hired a professional planner to create a land-use plan, which prevented problems associated with rapid growth. Alcott School opened in 1960. In 1962, the village held its first Buffalo Days festival, and the new Buffalo Grove flag—depicting a majestic, fighting buffalo, green leaves, and gold bands—was chosen.

In the 1970s, Buffalo Grove experienced an 80 percent population growth, the third-highest rate in the northwest suburbs during the decade. The increasing population caused the village to continue to annex subdivisions such as the Highlands, Green Knolls, and Windfield and establish home rule status, thereby allowing the government greater ability to solve local problems. In addition to residential subdivisions, the Buffalo Grove Commerce Center was developed in 1981 with 50 acres of industrial park at Lake Cook Road and the Soo Line Railroad tracks. In the mid-1980s, the Corporate Grove industrial park was built to the east, and Buffalo Grove Business Park was constructed to the west. The Arbor Creek Business Center at Aptakisic Road and Barclay Boulevard, and Covington Corporate Center on Busch Road were also developed. Important buildings and organizations were completed in the 1970s, including Buffalo Grove High School, Adlai E. Stevenson High School, the park district, Indian Trails Public Library, and Vernon Area Public Library. In 1992, village representatives successfully pushed for a United States Postal Service in Buffalo Grove, the first main postal facility built in the United States in twenty years. The lack of a postal facility had many problems for residents, such as long lines, congestion, and parking hassles at the Wheeling facility. In 2006, the village became one of the first official smoke-free communities by banning smoking in public places and work environments.

==Geography==
Buffalo Grove is a suburb of the city of Chicago, located in the extreme northeastern region of Illinois. Lake Cook Road splits Buffalo Grove into two parts: the Lake County Vernon Township portion and the Cook County Wheeling Township portion. Around three-quarters of the village is in Vernon Township. Both parts differ in their demographics and similarities with neighboring communities. Buffalo Grove shares a border with Wheeling to its southeast, Arlington Heights to its southwest and south, Riverwoods and Deerfield directly east, Lincolnshire to its northeast, Vernon Hills directly north, and Long Grove to its west and northwest. Unincorporated Prairie View is in two parts of the village. One large portion in the north includes Didier Farms, while the much smaller portion is on the Horatio Gardens subdivision just northeast of the intersection of Weiland Road and Pauline Avenue. Illinois Route 83 leads north towards central Lake County and south towards O&#x27;Hare International Airport. East–west streets can take residents east to Lake Michigan and other North Shore suburbs such as Lake Forest, Highland Park, and Glencoe.

According to the 2020 US gazetteer files, the village has a total area of , of which is land, and (or 0.31%) is water. Willow Stream Park is the largest park in Buffalo Grove at 54 acres. It includes picnic areas, handicap-accessible preschool and elementary play areas, sports fields, and bike paths. Buffalo Creek is a forest preserve located adjacent to Buffalo Grove. Before European settlement, the area featured a tallgrass prairie dotted with small wetlands and even now is a nesting spot for grassland birds, including bobolinks and eastern meadowlarks. Improvements in the 2010s include 1.7 miles of trails, seven boardwalks, two scenic overlooks, and a reservoir expansion. Buffalo Creek also functions as flood control and is built to look like a naturally occurring wetland. Buffalo Grove is in the Des Plaines River watershed.

===Climate===
Due to its proximity to the city, Buffalo Grove&#x27;s climate shares many of the same traits as Chicago. Buffalo Grove lies in a humid continental climate zone (Köppen: &quot;Dfa&quot;) and experiences four distinct seasons. Buffalo Grove receives an average of of precipitation each year. According to MyForecast, Buffalo Grove&#x27;s record high is 104 °F (40 °C), and the record low is -24 °F (-31.1 °C). Summers are hot and humid, with frequent heat waves. July is the hottest month, and the daily average temperature is 84 °F (28.9 °C), while the daily low temperatures are around 65 °F (18.3 °C). On average, summer temperatures reach at least 90 °F (32 °C) on as many as 16 days. Winters are relatively cold and snowy, with blizzards sometimes occurring, as in 2011. There are many sunny but cold days in winter. The average winter high from December through March is about 34 °F (1.1 °C), with January and February being the coldest months; a polar vortex occurred in January 2019. Spring and autumn are mild, short seasons. Dew point temperatures in the summer range from an average of 56 °F (13.3 °C) in June to 62 °F (16.7 °C) in July. Like all Chicago suburbs, Buffalo Grove lies within USDA plant hardiness zone 5b.

==Demographics==


As of the 2020 Census, Buffalo Grove has a population of 43,212, a 4.1 percent increase, with 1,716 more people than the 2010 United States Census. Originally incorporated with 164 people, Buffalo Grove experienced a population boom during its first few decades because of the suburban craze following World War II and the Korean War.

According to 2020 US Census Bureau data, the population of Buffalo Grove was 72.2% White (67.9% non-Hispanic White), 21% Asians, 1.6% African American, 0.2% American Indian or Alaska Native, 0.1% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and 2.8% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.92% of the population. Hispanics of any race made up 6.8% of the village&#x27;s population. The educational attainment of Buffalo Grove citizens were 97.7% graduating high school, 6.3% having an associate degree, 38.1% having a bachelor&#x27;s degree, and 28% having a master&#x27;s degree or professional degree. The median property value for owner-occupied houses was $332,300. Median household earnings were $115,951; men&#x27;s median earnings were $92,984; women&#x27;s median earnings were $66,705. The poverty rate was 3.4%.

Like many other northwest suburbs, Buffalo Grove contains a large Jewish population. Jewish immigrants in the 20th century moved from Germany and Eastern Europe to Chicago, and many enjoyed economic mobility throughout the first half of the 20th century. The German immigrants tended towards Reform Judaism in America while the Russian and Hungarian immigrants usually practiced Orthodox Judaism because they stuck with traditions from home. Despite Jewish success in Chicago, the younger generation left for the suburbs. Vacant land, reasonably priced housing, and a desire for single-family housing attracted many. Their high income and improved mobility from the automobile allowed them. In 1995, the population of the northern suburbs was around ten to 25 percent Jewish, with Buffalo Grove being over 25 percent. Buffalo Grove had six synagogues in 1995. Since the 1980s, the Jewish population has declined due to less immigration to the US, low birthrate, assimilation, intermarriage, and lack of Jewish identity.

In 2011, 16% of Buffalo Grove&#x27;s residents were Asian, the seventh-highest percent in Chicago suburbs. Buffalo Grove&#x27;s increasing Asian population continued in 2019, with the number jumping to 21%, compared with 8.4% in 2000. The particular Asians most represented in Buffalo Grove are Japanese Americans, Indian Americans, and Korean Americans. The schools, housing, work opportunities, religious institutions, ethnic businesses, and entertainment attract moving families. Also, NeighborhoodScout routinely ranks Buffalo Grove as one of the top 100 safest cities in the US, and some years, the top ten.

Being a suburb, Buffalo Grove attracts families looking for a good environment to raise children and avoid the downfalls of living in a city. According to the U.S. Census Bureau&#x27;s American Community Survey data estimates for 2015–2019, of the 15,399 households, 35.5% had children under 18 living with them, and 65.9% were married couples living together. Female householder families with no spouse or partner present who own children under 18 years made up 2.4% of all households (0.5% for male equivalent), and 3.3% of households were cohabiting couples. Of all households, 23.0% were individuals, and 28.6% had one or more people 65 years and over. The average household size was 2.66, and 41.6% spoke a language other than English at home. The median age was 41.7 years old. The age range was broad, with 23.0% of the population under 18, 32.5% aged 18 to 44 years, 30.0% aged 45 to 64 years, and 14.5% aged 65 years and older.

==Economy==
The Buffalo Grove economy includes several corporate business parks, a diverse retail market, and professional services. The 20,000-day workers operate in ten million square feet of commercial and industrial space. Retail areas are Town Center, Chase Plaza, and individual businesses in smaller commercial centers. Town Center has declined since being built in the 1980s. According to consultants of the village, it lacks a theme, has little street access and walkability, and has physically deteriorated. Industrially, Buffalo Grove is stronger. In 2017, industrial property vacancy was lower than that of the Chicago metro area and the US; also, the average gross rent was double that of the area average, suggesting that demand for property was high in the village.

The village government incentivizes multiple companies to operate in the village. Because Hines Supply has been the largest sales tax generator in Buffalo Grove, the village created a tax agreement in 2000 that—after being amended a few times—will last until 2040. The agreement requires the village to rebate 60 percent of the total sales tax collected. The village also created a $7 million tax agreement to incentivize the long-awaited and popular Woodman&#x27;s Markets to open in Buffalo Grove. It attracts shoppers from up to an hour away. The arrival spurred build out on Milwaukee Avenue and is part of Deerfield Parkway&#x27;s 25 acres of commercial development. Other companies in tax agreements are Business IT Source Inc. and ThermFlo.

In 2015, 72.5 percent of residents were in the labor force; the unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, a little lower than Lake County&#x27;s rate of 5.1 percent. Of those employed in 2015, 15.9 percent worked in Chicago, 5.7 percent worked in Buffalo Grove, and less than 4 percent in Arlington Heights, Schaumburg, and Wheeling. Around 10 percent of those employed in Buffalo Grove lived in Chicago, while 7.4 percent lived and worked in Buffalo Grove.

In 2019, the top five employers in Buffalo Grove were Siemens Building Technologies with 1,800 employees, I.S.I (business consulting) at 1,200, ESS (business consulting) at 550, Plexus Corp (an electronic parts supplier) at 370, and Veritas Document Solutions (commercial printer) at 300. Other large employers include US LBM Holdings, LLC (Hines Supply is a subsidiary), the Village of Buffalo Grove, ARxIUM, Vapor Bus International, and Leica Microsystems Inc.

==Arts and culture==
The Raupp Museum, operated by the Buffalo Grove Park District, chronicles the town&#x27;s history, starting with the Potawatomi and ending at the &quot;bustling suburb of today&quot;. In 1964, the Raupp brothers donated their land to the Park District with the wish that they make it a library or museum. Dedicated in 1979, the museum regularly receives grants from the state, allowing it to contain and preserve two permanent gallery spaces and changing exhibits while serving around 9,000 visitors a year. In 2014, the Buffalo Grove Park District opened the Community Arts Center, which houses a theater space and classrooms. The Park District&#x27;s local theater company, Big Deal Productions, uses the theater.

The Buffalo Grove Town Center, a major shopping and retail destination within the village, is located at the Buffalo Grove Road and McHenry Road intersections with Lake Cook Road. It accommodates the Buffalo Grove Theater and Bowlero: a bowling, arcade, laser tag, and birthday party venue. The Town Center has struggled throughout its existence, with the original development taking 17 years and redevelopment stagnating. The Buffalo Grove Invitational Fine Arts Festival was year-round at the Buffalo Grove Town Center in mid-July, with over 30,000 visitors attending on average. The last festival occurred in 2011.

The village is home to St. Mary&#x27;s Church, built in the 1850s by the Catholic population, and originally made up of ten members. It was reconstructed around the turn of the century after it burned down in a fire. The Gothic architecture contains miniature spires, wood tending, and stained windows which tower above the surrounding country. Buffalo Grove had six synagogues in 1995.

===Annual cultural events===

Buffalo Grove holds approximately ten events throughout the year, the largest being Buffalo Grove Days in September. The multi-day festival occurs at Mike Rylko Community Park, 951 McHenry Road., located on the east side of McHenry/Route 83, between Buffalo Grove Road and Deerfield Parkway, next to the Spray ’n’ Play waterpark. It features carnival games, roller coaster rides, arts and craft booths, food vendors, live music, and a parade held at the beginning of the festival. The festival usually attracts residents from Buffalo Grove and neighboring communities. Another prominent event is the Farmers&#x27; Market, also held at Mike Rylko Community Park. It lasts every Sunday morning from June to October, presenting &quot;locally grown fruits, vegetables, condiments, gourmet coffee and pastries, and more&quot;. In addition, businesses sponsor booths while non-profits showcase local organizations and businesses.

On June 2, 2019, Buffalo Grove held its inaugural pride parade, organized by the Pinta family, and has continued hosting annually. Other events and programs in Buffalo Grove include Rotary Village Green concerts, Lawn Chair Lyrics, Movies Under the Stars, Green Fair, Buffalo Grove Symphonic Band, Buffalo Grove Singers, National Night Out, Fourth of July Fireworks, and Golf at Buffalo Grove and Arboretum Golf Courses.

===Libraries===

The Indian Trails Public Library District serves Wheeling Township Buffalo Grove and a small portion of Lake County Buffalo Grove. It is located in Wheeling, south of the intersection of Dundee Road and Schoenbeck Road. The library has renovated, moved, and changed multiple times since beginning in a 20-foot by 30-foot frame building and holding fewer than 13,000 items in its collection. In 2009, the one-millionth item was checked out from the library.

Vernon Area Public Library District serves Vernon Township Buffalo Grove, located in Lincolnshire. The Vernon Area Public library began in 1974 in a classroom in the Adlai Stevenson High School and later moved to a temporary building in the high school parking lot. The first permanent library building was at 4 Indian Creek Road in Lincolnshire. On March 20, 1990, voters approved a referendum to sell $6.9 million in bonds to construct a new library adjacent to the existing library building. On September 15, 1993, the Vernon Area Public Library opened at 300 Olde Half Day Road in Lincolnshire. In 2019, the total collection use was 1,092,622.

==Sports and recreation==
Buffalo Grove has an extensive collection of parks and natural open spaces. Nicole Park is north of Old Checker Road along
Arlington Heights Road and contains a playground and open space. It is named after a 10-year-old girl who died in a nearby reservoir. Willow Stream Park along Old Checker Road serves the village with sports fields and courts, a pool, playground, and large open grass areas. Mike Rylko Community Park is home to the fairs and events mentioned above, and Buffalo Grove Fitness Center is north of Willow Stream; both feature similar amenities to Willow Stream. South of Lake Cook Road is Emmerich Park (named after a soldier), home to the Buffalo Grove Park District and where BGRA (mentioned below) plays many games. In total, Buffalo Grove has dozens of parks. In addition to parks, Buffalo Grove has 43 miles of paths and sidewalks in Buffalo Creek Trail, Des Plaines River Trail, and Cook County Forest Preserve District.

The non-profit corporation Buffalo Grove Recreation Association (BGRA), not affiliated with the park district, provides a youth baseball league for the community. Founded in 1961, BGRA&#x27;s 1,500 players and 600 volunteers participate in House Baseball (for anyone), Travel Baseball (try out), and Buddy Baseball. Buddy Baseball pairs special needs children and non-disabled buddies, who help them play baseball.

Buffalo Grove has two golf courses and one indoor golf facility. The Buffalo Grove Golf Course is one of the largest open spaces within the village. Utilized as a floodplain, the course both functions as enjoyment and civil infrastructure. The Arboretum Club, which opened in 1990, is an 18-hole course. Lastly, the park district&#x27;s 100 by 60-yard Golf Dome has a 75-yard driving range, putting green, and hitting stations.

Multiple notable athletes have originated from Buffalo Grove. Felice Herrig, a native of Buffalo Grove, is a kickboxer, Muay Thai fighter, and mixed martial artist. In 2021, she was No. 15 on the UFC women&#x27;s strawweight rankings. Zach Borenstein had a .524 batting average as a senior at Buffalo Grove High School and subsequently played at Eastern Illinois University and multiple minor league teams. Andy Wozniewski, a former ice hockey player for the Toronto Maple Leafs and other teams, including Team USA at the Deutschland Cup, was born in Buffalo Grove. Brett Lebda, ice hockey defenseman for multiple teams, including the Toronto Maple Leafs, attended Buffalo Grove High School. Buffalo Grove native Megan Bozek is an ice hockey player who plays for the KRS Vanke Rays and the United States national team. Finally, Olympic figure skater Bradie Tennell trained most of her life at Twin Rinks in Buffalo Grove. She is a 2018 Olympic team event bronze medalist, the 2020 Four Continents bronze medalist, the 2018 CS Autumn Classic champion, the 2018 CS Golden Spin of Zagreb champion, and a two-time US national champion (2018, 2021).

==Government==
The government of Buffalo Grove is a council-manager form of government with elements of home rule, gained in 1980. The village president and six trustees with four-year terms lead the government. The daily functions of the village are carried out by an appointed village manager whose job includes attracting new businesses, presenting an annual budget, and much more. According to the village, the village manager&#x27;s function &quot;is similar to that of a general manager in a multi-division service organization&quot;. Accordingly, the village manager, Dane Bragg, received a $267,310 salary in 2019 plus a $15,000 bonus.

In 2021, the village expected $107 million in revenues to support $113 million in expenditures. Fire Department and Police pensions and Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund were the steepest expenditures, totaling around $7 million. In 2017, the biggest revenue sources were taxes at 58 percent (property taxes were largest at 34 percent) and intergovernmental revenues at 27 percent. The sales tax rate for Cook and Lake County is 10 percent and 8 percent. Also, the tax rate on food and beverages sold at restaurants in the Cook County portion of Buffalo Grove is 11 percent (10 percent for sales tax and 1 percent for food and beverage tax), while in Lake County, the same tax on food sold at restaurants is 9 percent. Budgeted employment in 2018 for Police, Fire, Public Works, Golf, and Administration was 260 people.

==Education==
Buffalo Grove has four private schools, over ten public schools, and one public high school. Lake County Buffalo Grove districts are Aptakisic-Tripp Community Consolidated School District 102 and Kildeer Countryside Community Consolidated School District 96, while Cook County Buffalo Grove has Wheeling Community Consolidated School District 21. High school students in the Lake County portion of Buffalo Grove attend Stevenson High School in nearby Lincolnshire. Cook County students attend Buffalo Grove High School, located in the Cook County part of the village.

The three districts that take students from Buffalo Grove have different histories. Since the 1840s, schools serving Buffalo Grove changed in response to the growing community. They were consolidated in 1955 under the name Aptakisic-Tripp Community Consolidated School District 102. The first school to open in Buffalo Grove was the Alcott School in 1961—now the Alcott Center—in response to growth on the Cook County side (a different district Aptakisic-Tripp). The first year had 52 first-graders and six sixth graders. To support the rapidly growing village, the district held referendums and successfully built Pritchett Elementary School, Tripp School, and Meridian School in the 1980s. To accommodate the continued increase in population, the district changed the configuration of the grades in the schools in 2018. Buffalo Grove High School&#x27;s district (Township High School District 214) almost did not pass the referendum because women&#x27;s votes were not counted immediately; the referendum was eventually successful.

==Infrastructure==
Buffalo Grove relies on multiple arterial roads. Going north-south, drivers use Milwaukee Avenue (Illinois Route 21) on the east side of the village, Buffalo Grove Road and Weiland Road down the center, and Arlington Heights Road on the west side of Buffalo Grove. Going east-west, drivers use Dundee Road (Illinois Route 68) in south Buffalo Grove, Lake Cook Road and Deerfield Parkway in the center, and Aptakisic and Half Day Road (Illinois Route 22) in the north. McHenry Road (Illinois Route 83) acts as a diagonal road in the village by going north–south and east–west. O&#x27;hare International Airport is approximately south of Buffalo Grove. Because of Lake Cook Road, the village has access to the Interstate Highway system (I-90, I-94, and I-294).

Pace provides bus service on multiple routes with a hub at the Buffalo Grove Metra station.

===Metra===

Since its creation in 1996, the Buffalo Grove station has operated on Metra&#x27;s North Central Service, which provides daily commuter rail service between Antioch and Chicago&#x27;s Union Station. 
The station is away from the southern terminus of the line Union Station. In Metra&#x27;s zone-based fare system, Buffalo Grove is in zone F. As of 2018, Buffalo Grove is the 76th busiest of Metra&#x27;s 236 non-downtown stations, with an average of 695 weekday boardings, making it the most trafficked station on the North Central Service. The train station is just east of the intersection of Weiland Road and Deerfield Parkway.

The Prairie View station is north of Half Day Road (IL Route 22) and Prairie Road&#x27;s intersection, and it is also used by Buffalo Grove residents. Located along the eastern boundary of the village, the station is away from Union Station. Prairie View is in zone G. As of 2018, Prairie View is the 113th busiest of Metra&#x27;s 236 non-downtown stations, with an average of 415 weekday boardings. The North Central Service runs primarily during rush hour, but not on the weekends and few holidays; instead, Buffalo Grove residents must use the Arlington Heights Metra Station, the Deerfield Metra Station, or the Lake Cook Road Metra Station.

===Utilities===

Water in Buffalo Grove is from Lake Michigan, and Commonwealth Edison provides electric power. The village purchases water from the Northwest Water Commission and controls the distribution of water. It travels through four pumping stations and 181 miles of underground water main. Also, Buffalo Grove flushes hydrants, plows streets, and repairs faulty water meters of private residents. There is a Stormwater Utility Fee for Buffalo Grove owning and maintaining the Stormwater Management System, composed of storm sewers, creeks, waterways, and detention areas.

Buffalo Grove operates on an exclusive contract with Waste Management, Inc. for solid waste disposal. This contract includes &quot;At Your Door (AYD) Service,&quot; which allows a pick-up of hazardous and difficult-to-recycle materials, such as electronics, televisions, paint, and chemicals. In 2004, the Village of Buffalo Grove Public Works Department received national accreditation from the American Public Works Association, the second agency to earn recognition in Illinois.

<text>Burbank is a city in Cook County, Illinois, United States. The population was 29,439 at the 2020 census. It borders the southwest edge of the city of Chicago; the Chicago city limit – specifically that of the Ashburn neighborhood – is in common with Burbank&#x27;s eastern city limit. Burbank shares a boundary with Oak Lawn to its south, Bridgeview to its west, and Bedford Park to its north; the city of Hometown is also adjacent to Burbank&#x27;s southeast corner. Burbank is less than two miles south of Chicago Midway International Airport.

==History==
In 1850, the area which would become the city of Burbank, then largely uninhabited and agrarian, became part of Lyons Township. Over the next hundred years the area remained largely undeveloped, though several times large plans were laid out for the area, never to come to fruition. In the late 19th century a railroad investor named A. B. Stickney planned a large railroad transfer center which included what became the northern part of Burbank, but his ideas were never realized due to an economic depression in 1893.

In the 1920s, the area became an attractive site for real-estate developers who bought up farmland and built subdivisions. However, ongoing drainage problems, practically nonexistent water and sewage systems and the Great Depression kept Burbank largely unbuilt and empty until the 1950s.

In 1952, the area became part of Stickney Township. Though still unincorporated, this led to massive development in the area, and by 1960 the population of the area had reached 20,720, nearly triple the population of a decade earlier. The area was incorporated into a city in 1970, partly to resist annexation by the City of Chicago. The city was named after Luther Burbank Elementary School, an institution which had served the area since the 1930s. The area&#x27;s population peaked in 1976 at 29,448.

<text>Burnham is a village in Cook County, Illinois, United States. The population was 4,046 at the 2020 census. Burnham has a Chicago ZIP code (60633) and was named for Telford Burnham, who drew its plat.

There are two sections of Burnham. The westernmost section surrounds Torrence Avenue, a north–south street. Torrence Avenue leaves this part of Burnham via a bridge, with Chicago on the other side.

Upon entering Chicago, Burnham Avenue becomes Avenue O.

==History==
Due to its close proximity to Chicago Burnham is frequently the subject of annexation debates for the city. One of the arguments is that Burnham is simply too small to govern itself efficiently without a high municipal tax burden, and that it would be cheaper for Burnham residents to be annexed into Chicago.

<text>Burr Ridge (formerly Harvester) is a village in Cook and DuPage counties in the U.S. state of Illinois. Per the 2020 census, the population was 11,192.

==Geography==
Burr Ridge is located at (41.753030, -87.919998).

According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Burr Ridge has a total area of , of which (or 98.15%) is land and (or 1.85%) is water.

Burr Ridge lies in both Du Page and Cook counties. The village is bordered by Hinsdale to the north, Western Springs to the northeast, Indian Head Park to the east, Willow Springs to the south and southeast, and Willowbrook to the west, along with several unincorporated areas.

==History==
Burr Ridge&#x27;s gently rolling hills were carved by glaciers at the end of the last ice age, and most of the village lies on the Valparaiso Moraine. Flagg Creek, a tributary of the Des Plaines River, runs through town.

Joseph Vial erected a log cabin near Wolf and Plainfield roads in 1834. Vial also ran a hotel on the stagecoach line, and the Vial family was actively involved in Lyons Township politics and the creation of the Lyonsville congregational church. The first Democratic convention in Cook County was held in Burr Ridge in 1835. After 1848, farmers shipped their goods to Chicago along the Illinois and Michigan Canal. A small settlement of German farmers also inhabited Flagg Creek by the 1880s.

In 1917, the International Harvester Company purchased for an experimental farm, where it tested the world&#x27;s first all-purpose tractor, the Farmall. Also in 1917, the Cook County Prison Farm (also known as the Bridewell Farm) began operation in what is now Burr Ridge.

In 1947, developer Robert Bartlett, whose company also developed Beverly Shores and Countryside, established the Hinsdale Countryside Estates out of a former pig farm. In 1956 these residents decided to incorporate as the village of Harvester, in honor of International Harvester.

In the 1940s, Denver Busby bought that became known as the Burr Ridge dairy farm. He later launched the Burr Ridge Estates, with home sites. In 1961, International Harvester and the Burr Ridges Estates merged with Harvester, changing the community&#x27;s name to Burr Ridge. The town name is derived from a group of bur oak. By 1963, the population had more than doubled, to 790, and by 1975 it had soared to over 2,200.

In 1969, Chicago mayor Richard J. Daley suggested a proposal to build low-income subsidized housing on the prison farm property, but Republican-dominated DuPage County quashed the idea. The prison farm site became the Ambriance subdivision, a gated community of multimillion-dollar homes. The Four Pines Farm gave way to the Carriage Way subdivision, at whose entrance the original farmhouse still stands, and in 1971 additional farmland became the Braemoor neighborhood. An area known as Valley View, once owned by a Chicago industrialist and later by the Chicago chapter of the Boy Scouts of America, was developed in the early 1970s as the Burr Ridge Club. The village also has five corporate parks. As with other towns in the industrial corridor southwest of Chicago, close proximity to Interstates 294 and 55 spurred development in Burr Ridge.

<text>Calumet City ( ) is a city in Cook County, Illinois, United States. The population was 36,033 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Chicago metropolitan area.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Calumet&quot; is the Miꞌkmaq and French word for a Ceremonial pipe as used by Native Americans.

==History==
Calumet City (commonly referred to locally as &quot;Cal City&quot;) was founded in 1893 when the villages of Schrumville and Sobieski Park merged under the name of West Hammond, since it lies on the west side of the Illinois-Indiana line from Hammond, Indiana.

In 1916, when alcohol was prohibited in Indiana, West Hammond became a preferred location for drinkers coming from northwest Indiana. Bootleggers including Al Capone built on this basis once the Prohibition era arrived, and West Hammond gained the nickname of &quot;Sin City&quot;.

West Hammond became known for illegal alcohol consumption, gambling, and prostitution. In 1923, residents wishing to rid the city of its reputation voted to change the name from West Hammond to Calumet City.

Frank LaPorte is believed to have been the member of the Chicago Outfit who was most responsible for developing and maintaining the &quot;Sin Strip&quot; area of Calumet City. Police avoided Sin Strip and risked violence if they tried to make an arrest.

In 1959, the state of Illinois conducted a police raid that resulted in 98 arrests and the seizure of business records. An article published in &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; on June 2, 1959, exposed LaPorte as being instrumental in the illegal activities in Calumet City.

In 1995, the city began demolishing bars and taverns in the &quot;Sin Strip&quot; area.

==In popular culture==

Calumet City is featured or mentioned in a number of major movies. John Belushi&#x27;s &quot;Joliet Jake&quot; and Dan Aykroyd&#x27;s &quot;Elwood&quot; characters from &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; were born in Calumet City, and so is the orphanage they grew up in, which they save &quot;on a mission from God&quot; by paying $5,000 in property taxes from a $10,000 record deal at their concert, as well as &quot;Ray&#x27;s Music Exchange&quot; that holds the famed Ray Charles &quot;Shake Your Tail-Feather&quot; scene of the movie. In the book and film &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, Buffalo Bill is thought to be hiding in Calumet City, when he is actually in Belvedere, Ohio. The Calumet City scenes in the film were filmed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, however. Lily Tomlin&#x27;s prim but assertive housewife/spokesperson &quot;Mrs. Judith Beasley&quot; is said to be a resident of Calumet City. She said, &quot;Hi. I am not an actress, but a real person like yourself.&quot;

Calumet City is also referenced by a number of popular music acts. The Black Crowes included a video of the Smiley Towers in their 1990 video for &quot;Hard to Handle&quot;. A photograph of the &quot;Dolton&quot; smiley water tower is featured on the back of the Dead Kennedys album &quot;Plastic Surgery Disasters&quot;. Rapper Twista has referenced Calumet City. Kanye West&#x27;s reference to Calumet in his 2005 song &quot;Drive Slow&quot; does not refer to Calumet City, but rather to Calumet High School, which was located in the South Side of Chicago and not in Calumet City.

The Smiley Tower is also featured in the movie &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;; it is seen out the window of Mallory&#x27;s family home (part of that movie was filmed in Hammond, Indiana). In the Nine Inch Nails music video on the director&#x27;s cut of the same film, the Smiley Tower and Dolton Avenue/State Street is featured.

The founders of the Calumet Baking Powder Company adopted its brand name from the original Native American word for the land that became Calumet City. They later named one of thoroughbred horse racing&#x27;s most famed and successful enterprises, Calumet Farm, after the company.

In 2004, Alan Keyes purchased a raised ranch house in Calumet City to establish residency in Illinois so he could run for the U.S. Senate in place of Jack Ryan against Barack Obama, although instead of residing in the house, he officially moved into an apartment elsewhere in town, on Garfield Avenue.

In 2010, pop music group Hanson remade the &quot;Shake Your Tailfeather&quot; scene from &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; for the music video for their hit &quot;Thinkin&#x27; &#x27;Bout Somethin&#x27;&quot; in Tulsa, Oklahoma, paying homage to Calumet City&#x27;s Ray&#x27;s Music Exchange, John Belushi, and Ray Charles.

Jean Shepherd (writer and narrator of the classic movie &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;) in radio broadcasts from WOR radio, New York in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s and in his PBS specials of the 1970s and 1980s, and his many books, often refers to it as Cal City or just Calumet. He grew up in nearby Hammond, Indiana.

===Public library===
On May 20, 1901, many Chicago Heights residents signed a petition asking for the mayor and aldermen to select a board of directors that would be responsible for founding and running a free public library in Chicago Heights. On June 28, 1901, the first library board members were sworn in, including Sam W. Lea, F.W. Schact, W.E. Canady, James Bowie, David Wallace, Joseph Caldwell, C.W. Salisbury, A.J. Sorensen, and A.W. McEldowney. The library was opened in a small room in the new city building on February 20, 1902. That month, the library board wrote to industrialist Andrew Carnegie seeking funds to build a library building in Chicago Heights. In July, the board was notified that Carnegie had proposed $15,000 toward the cost of a library building as long as the city could provide a free site for the building and if the council could promise $1,500 a year to keep the library running. The Carnegie Library in Chicago Heights was designed by Richard E. Schmidt. The library was located at 1627 Halsted Street and opened on September 11, 1903, with a staff of two and 1,643 volumes. A bigger library was eventually needed, and on August 5, 1972, the present building at 15th Street and Chicago Road was opened. The Chicago Heights Free Public Library was a million-dollar building that opened with 60,000 books, records, and other materials.
