<text>Andy Samuel Griffith (June 1, 1926 – July 3, 2012) was an American actor, comedian, television producer, singer, and writer whose career spanned seven decades in music and television. Known for his Southern drawl, his characters with a folksy-friendly personality, as well as his gruff but friendly voice, Griffith was a Tony Award nominee for two roles. He gained prominence in the starring role in director Elia Kazan&#x27;s film &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; (1957) and &quot;No Time for Sergeants&quot; (1958) before he became better known for his television roles, playing the lead roles of Andy Taylor in the sitcom &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; (1960–1968) and Ben Matlock in the legal drama &quot;Matlock&quot; (1986–1995).

==Early life and education==
Griffith was born on June 1, 1926, in Mount Airy, North Carolina, the only child of Carl Lee Griffith and his wife, Geneva (née Nunn). As a baby, Griffith lived with relatives until his parents could afford to buy a home. With neither a crib nor a bed, he slept in dresser drawers for several months. In 1929, when Griffith was three, his father began working as a helper or carpenter and purchased a home in Mount Airy&#x27;s &quot;blue-collar&quot; south side. Griffith grew up listening to music. By the time he entered school, he was well aware that he was from what many considered the &quot;wrong side of the tracks&quot;. He was a shy student, but once he found a way to make his peers laugh, he began to come out of his shell and come into his own.

As a student at Mount Airy High School, Griffith cultivated an interest in the arts, and he participated in the school&#x27;s drama program. A growing love of music, particularly swing, would change his life. Griffith was raised Baptist and looked up to Ed Mickey, a minister at Grace Moravian Church, who led the brass band and taught him to sing and play the trombone. Mickey nurtured Griffith&#x27;s talent throughout high school until graduation in 1944. Griffith was delighted when he was offered a role in &quot;The Lost Colony&quot; by Paul Green, a play about Roanoke Island still performed today. He performed as a cast member of the play for several years, playing a variety of roles until he finally landed the role of Sir Walter Raleigh, for whom North Carolina&#x27;s capital is named.

He attended the University of North Carolina (UNC) in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and graduated with a Bachelor of Music degree in 1949. He began college studying to be a Moravian preacher, but he changed his major to music and became a part of the school&#x27;s Carolina Playmakers. At UNC, he was president of the UNC chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, America&#x27;s oldest fraternity for men in music. He also played roles in several student operettas, including &quot;The Chimes of Normandy&quot; (1946), and Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Gondoliers&quot; (1945), &quot;The Mikado&quot; (1948) and &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; (1949). After graduation, he taught music and drama for a few years at Goldsboro High School in Goldsboro, North Carolina, where he taught, among others, Carl Kasell. He also began to write.

==Career==

===From rising comedian to film star===
Griffith&#x27;s early career was as a monologist, delivering long stories such as &quot;What It Was, Was Football&quot;, which is told from the point of view of a naïve country preacher trying to figure out what was going on in a football game. The monologue was released as a single in 1953 on the Colonial Records label, and was a hit for Griffith, reaching number nine on the charts in 1954.

Griffith starred in Ira Levin&#x27;s one-hour teleplay, &quot;No Time for Sergeants&quot; (March 1955) — a story about a country boy in the United States Air Force — on &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, a television anthology series. He expanded that role in Ira Levin&#x27;s full-length theatrical version of the same name (October 1955) on Broadway in New York City. The role earned him a Tony Award nomination for &quot;Distinguished Supporting or Featured Dramatic Actor&quot; nomination at the 1956 Tony Awards, losing to Ed Begley. He did win the 1956 Theatre World Award, however, a prize given for debut roles on Broadway. &quot;Mr. Griffith does not have to condescend to Will Stockdale&quot; (his role in the play), wrote Brooks Atkinson in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;All he has to do is walk on the stage and look the audience straight in the face. If the armed forces cannot cope with Will Stockdale, neither can the audience resist Andy Griffith.&quot;

Griffith later reprised his role for the film version (1958) of &quot;No Time for Sergeants&quot;; the film also featured Don Knotts, as a corporal in charge of manual-dexterity tests, marking the beginning of a lifelong association between Griffith and Knotts. &quot;No Time for Sergeants&quot; is considered the direct inspiration for the later television situation comedy &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot; – a spin-off of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;.

His only other New York stage appearance was the title role in the 1959 musical &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot;, co-starring Dolores Gray. The show, with a score by Harold Rome, ran for 472 performances and more than a year. Griffith was nominated for &quot;Distinguished Musical Actor&quot; at the 1960 Tony Awards, losing to Jackie Gleason. He also portrayed a US Coast Guard sailor in the feature film &quot;Onionhead&quot; (1958). It was neither a critical nor a commercial success.

===Dramatic role in &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; (1957)===

In 1957, Griffith made his film debut starring in the film &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot;. He plays a &quot;country boy&quot; who is manipulative and power-hungry: a drifter who becomes a television host and uses his show as a gateway to political power. The film was directed by Elia Kazan and written by Budd Schulberg and co-stars Patricia Neal, Walter Matthau, Tony Franciosa, and Lee Remick (in her film debut).

A 2005 DVD reissue of &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; includes a mini-documentary on the film, with comments from Schulberg and cast members Griffith, Franciosa, and Neal. In his interview, Griffith recalls Kazan prepping him to shoot his first scene with Remick&#x27;s teenaged baton twirler, who captivates Griffith&#x27;s character on a trip to Arkansas. Griffith also expresses his belief that the film is more popular in recent decades than it was when originally released.

===Television roles===

====Early television roles====
Griffith&#x27;s first appearance on television was in 1955 in the one-hour teleplay of &quot;No Time for Sergeants&quot; on &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;. That was the first of two appearances on that series. In 1960, Griffith appeared as a county sheriff, who was also a justice of the peace and the editor of the local newspaper, in an episode of &quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot; starring Danny Thomas. This episode, in which Thomas&#x27;s character is stopped for running a stop sign in a little town, served as a backdoor pilot for &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;. Both shows were produced by Sheldon Leonard.

====&quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; (1960–1968)====

Beginning in September 1960, Griffith starred as Sheriff Andy Taylor in &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; for the CBS television network. The show took place in the fictional town of Mayberry, North Carolina, where Taylor, a widower, was the sheriff and town sage. The show was filmed at Desilu Studios, with exteriors filmed at Forty Acres in Culver City, California.

From 1960 to 1965, the show co-starred character actor and comedian — and Griffith&#x27;s longtime friend — Don Knotts in the role of Deputy Barney Fife, Taylor&#x27;s best friend and comedy partner. He was also Taylor&#x27;s cousin in the show at first, though later they dropped that cousin relationship and talked simply of knowing one another since boyhood. In the series premiere episode, in a conversation between the two, Fife calls Taylor &quot;Cousin Andy&quot;, and Taylor calls Fife &quot;Cousin Barney&quot;. The show also starred child actor Ron Howard (then known as Ronny Howard), who played Taylor&#x27;s only child, Opie Taylor. It was an immediate hit. Griffith never received a writing credit for the show, but he worked on the development of every script. Knotts was frequently lauded and won multiple Emmy Awards for his comedic performances, as did Frances Bavier in 1967, while Griffith was never nominated for an Emmy Award during the show&#x27;s run.
In 1967, Griffith was under contract with CBS to do one more season of the show. However, he decided to quit the show to pursue a movie career and other projects. The series continued as &quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot;, with Ken Berry starring as a widower farmer and many of the regular characters recurring, some regularly and some as guest appearances. Griffith served as executive producer (according to Griffith, he came in once a week to review the week&#x27;s scripts and give input) and guest starred in five episodes (the pilot episode involved his marriage to Helen Crump). He made final appearances as Taylor in the 1986 reunion television film, &quot;Return to Mayberry&quot;, with fellow co-star, Don Knotts. Two reunion specials followed in 1993 and 2003, with strong ratings.

====&quot;Matlock&quot; (1986–1995)====
After leaving his still-popular show in 1968, and starting his own production company Andy Griffith Enterprises in 1972, Griffith starred in less-successful television series such as &quot;Headmaster&quot; (1970), &quot;The New Andy Griffith Show&quot; (1971), &quot;Adams of Eagle Lake&quot; (1975), &quot;Salvage 1&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Yeagers&quot; (1980). After spending seven months in rehabilitation for leg paralysis from Guillain–Barré syndrome in 1983, Griffith returned to television as the title character, Ben Matlock, in the legal drama &quot;Matlock&quot; (1986–1995) on NBC and ABC. Matlock was a country lawyer in Atlanta, Georgia, who was known for his Southern drawl and for always winning his cases. &quot;Matlock&quot; also starred unfamiliar, struggling actors (both of whom were childhood fans of Andy Griffith) Nancy Stafford as Michelle Thomas (1987–1992) and Clarence Gilyard, Jr. as Conrad McMasters (1989–1993). By the end of its first season it was a ratings powerhouse on Tuesday nights. Although the show was nominated for four Emmy Awards, Griffith once again was never nominated. He did, however, win a People&#x27;s Choice Award in 1987 for his work as Matlock.

====Other television appearances====
Griffith also made other character appearances through the years on &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot;, &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;The Doris Day Show&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;, &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; and &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, among many others. He also reprised his role as Ben Matlock on &quot;&quot; in 1997, and his final guest-starring role was in 2001 in an episode of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;.

===Films (including television films)===

For most of the 1970s, Griffith starred or appeared in many television films, including &quot;The Strangers in 7A&quot; (1972), &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; (1973), &quot;Winter Kill&quot; (1974) and &quot;Pray for the Wildcats&quot; (1974), which marked his first villainous role since &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot;. Griffith appeared again as a villain in &quot;Savages&quot; (1974), a television film based on the novel &quot;Deathwatch&quot; (1972) by Robb White. He appeared as The Father in a 1976 PBS television adaptation, directed by Stacy Keach, of Luigi Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot;. Griffith received his only Primetime Emmy Award nomination as Outstanding Supporting Actor – Miniseries or a Movie for his role as the father of a murder victim in the television film &quot;Murder in Texas&quot; (1981) and won further acclaim for his role as a homicidal villain in the television film &quot;Murder in Coweta County&quot; (1983), co-starring music legend Johnny Cash as the sheriff. He also appeared in several television miniseries, including the television version of &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1979), &quot;&quot; (1979), &quot;Centennial&quot; (1978), and the Watergate scandal-inspired &quot;&quot; (1977), playing a former president loosely based on Lyndon B. Johnson.

Most of the television movies in which Griffith starred were also attempts to launch a new series. &quot;Winter Kill&quot; (1974) launched the short-lived &quot;Adams of Eagle Lake&quot;, which was canceled in 1975 after only two episodes. A year later, he starred as a New York City attorney for the DA&#x27;s office in &quot;Street Killing&quot;, which also failed to launch a new show. Two television films for NBC in 1977, &quot;The Girl in the Empty Grave&quot; and &quot;Deadly Game&quot;, were attempts for Griffith to launch a new series featuring him as Police Chief Abel Marsh, a more hard-edged version of Andy Taylor; despite strong ratings, both were unsuccessful in leading to a new TV show.

During this period, Griffith also appeared in two feature films, both of which flopped at the box office. He co-starred with Jeff Bridges as a crusty old 1930s western actor in the comedy &quot;Hearts of the West&quot; (1975), and he appeared alongside Tom Berenger as a gay villainous colonel and cattle baron in the Western comedy spoof &quot;Rustlers&#x27; Rhapsody&quot; (1985).

Following another short-lived return to series television, playing a family patriarch in the &quot;Dynasty&quot;-inspired &quot;The Yeagers&quot; in 1980, Griffith continued to make guest appearances in several hit series, including &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, where he played a fictional version of western figure Judge Roy Bean featured in an aspiring singer&#x27;s fantasy, and an episode of &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, which featured a memorable appearance by pop icon Andy Warhol. He also appeared as an attorney in the NBC miniseries &quot;Fatal Vision&quot; (1984), which is considered a precursor to his role in &quot;Matlock&quot;.

Griffith stunned many unfamiliar with his &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; work in the television film &quot;Crime of Innocence&quot; (1985)...wherein he portrayed a hateful and vindictive judge who routinely sentenced juveniles to hard prison time, followed by lengthy and equally-torturous probation. Also noteworthy in Griffith&#x27;s darker roles was his character in &quot;Under the Influence&quot; (1986), a TV movie in which Griffith played an alcoholic, abusive patriarch. He further surprised audiences with his role as a dangerous and mysterious grandfather in the television film &quot;Gramps&quot; (1995) co-starring John Ritter. He also appeared as a comical villain in the spy movie spoof &quot;Spy Hard&quot; (1996) starring Leslie Nielsen. In the television film &quot;A Holiday Romance&quot; (1999), Griffith played the role of Jake Peterson. In the film &quot;Daddy and Them&quot; (2001), Griffith portrayed the patriarch of a dysfunctional southern family.

In the feature film &quot;Waitress&quot; (2007), Griffith played a crusty diner owner who takes a shine to Keri Russell&#x27;s character. His last appearance was the leading role in the romantic comedy, independent film &quot;Play the Game&quot; (2009) as a lonely, widowed grandfather re-entering the dating world after a 60-year hiatus. The cast of &quot;Play the Game&quot; also included Rance Howard, Ron Howard&#x27;s real-life father, who had made appearances in various supporting roles on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, and Clint Howard, Ron&#x27;s younger brother, who had the recurring role of Leon (the kid offering the ice cream cone or peanut butter sandwich) on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;.

===Singing and recording career===
Griffith sang as part of some of his acting roles, most notably in &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; and in many episodes of both &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; and &quot;Matlock&quot;. In addition to his recordings of comic monologues in the 1950s, he made an album of upbeat country and gospel tunes during the run of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, which included a version of the show&#x27;s theme sung by Griffith under the title &quot;The Fishin&#x27; Hole&quot;. In later years, he recorded successful albums of classic Christian hymns for Sparrow Records. His most successful was the release &quot;I Love to Tell the Story: 25 Timeless Hymns&quot; (1996), which was certified platinum by the RIAA. The album won Grammy Award for Best Southern, Country or Bluegrass Gospel Album at the 1997 Grammy Awards.

Griffith appeared in country singer Brad Paisley&#x27;s music video &quot;Waitin&#x27; on a Woman&quot; (2008).

===Name dispute===
William Harold Fenrick of Platteville, Wisconsin, legally changed his name to Andrew Jackson Griffith and ran unsuccessfully for sheriff of Grant County in November 2006. Subsequently, actor Griffith filed a lawsuit against Griffith/Fenrick, asserting that he violated trademark, copyright, and privacy laws by changing his name for the &quot;sole purpose of taking advantage of Griffith&#x27;s fame in an attempt to gain votes&quot;. On May 4, 2007, US District Court Judge John C. Shabaz ruled that Griffith/Fenrick did not violate federal trademark law because he did not use the Griffith name in a commercial transaction but instead in order &quot;to seek elective office, fundamental First Amendment protected speech&quot;.

==Association with Don Knotts and Ron Howard==

===Don Knotts===

Griffith&#x27;s friendship with Don Knotts began in 1955 when they co-starred in the Broadway play &quot;No Time for Sergeants&quot;. Several years later, Knotts had a regular role on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; for five seasons. Knotts left the series in 1965, but periodically returned for guest appearances. He appeared in the pilot for Griffith&#x27;s subsequent short-lived series, &quot;The New Andy Griffith Show&quot;, and he had a recurring role on &quot;Matlock&quot;, from 1988 to 1992. In a January 2000 interview, Griffith said of Knotts, &quot;The five years we worked together were the best five years of my life.&quot;

They kept in touch until Knotts&#x27;s death in early 2006. Griffith traveled from his Manteo, North Carolina, home to Los Angeles to visit the terminally ill Knotts at Cedars-Sinai just before Knotts died of lung cancer.

===Ron Howard===

Griffith&#x27;s friendship with child actor Ron Howard began in 1960 when they guest-starred in the episode of &quot;Make Room For Daddy&quot; that led to the formation of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; the same year. For eight seasons, they starred together in most of the show&#x27;s episodes, portraying father and son.

They guest-starred together in the show&#x27;s spin-off series &quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot; They appeared in an episode during which Griffith&#x27;s character married his long-time girlfriend, Helen Crump, and in the &quot;Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C.&quot; episode &quot;Opie Joins the Marines&quot;, in which Howard&#x27;s character, Opie, runs away from home and attempts to enlist in the US Marines. They co-starred in the TV special &quot;Return to Mayberry&quot; (1986), in which the now-adult Opie is about to become a father. They later appeared together in CBS reunion specials in 1993 and 2003. Griffith also made a comedy cameo on the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; program of October 9, 1982, hosted by Howard, who was, by then, in the early years of his directing career.

In October 2008, Griffith and Howard briefly reprised their Mayberry roles in an online video &quot;Ron Howard&#x27;s Call to Action&quot;. It was posted to comedy video website Funny or Die. The video encouraged people to vote and endorsed Democratic candidates Barack Obama and Joe Biden.

After Griffith&#x27;s death, Howard stated: 

In a 2016 interview with &quot;US Magazine&quot;, Howard recalled Griffith encouraging his scriptwriting when he was just seven years old, saying &quot;I felt elated.&quot; Howard recounted: &quot;Andy Griffith said, &#x27;What are you grinnin&#x27; at, young&#x27;un?&#x27; I said, &#x27;That&#x27;s the first idea of mine they&#x27;ve taken.&#x27; He said, &#x27;It&#x27;s the first that was any damn good. Now let&#x27;s rehearse!&#x27;&quot;

==Political activities==
In 2000, Griffith appeared in a last-minute campaign commercial where he endorsed Democratic Party candidate and then-Attorney General Mike Easley for governor of North Carolina. Easley had been locked in a tight race with former Mayor of Charlotte Richard Vinroot and had been losing his lead in the polls. Easley went on to win that November, taking 52% of the vote to Vinroot&#x27;s 46%. Many observers dubbed Easley&#x27;s victory as the &quot;Mayberry Miracle&quot;, and credit Griffith&#x27;s endorsement for stopping his falling poll numbers.

In October 2008, Griffith appeared with Ron Howard in a Funny or Die video endorsement for Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign. In addition to his endorsement of Obama, Griffith recorded a television commercial endorsing Democratic candidate Bev Perdue for governor of North Carolina the same year. He spoke at the inauguration ceremonies of both Easley in 2001 and Purdue in 2009. In 1989, he declined an offer by Democratic Party officials to run against Jesse Helms, a Republican Senator from North Carolina.

In July 2010, he also starred in advertisements about Medicare.

==Personal life==
In 1945, while a student at the University of North Carolina, Griffith was initiated as a member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, a national social music fraternity for men.

Griffith and Barbara Bray Edwards were married on August 22, 1949, and they adopted two children: a son named Andy Samuel Griffith Jr. (born in 1957 and better known as Sam Griffith) and a daughter named Dixie Nann Griffith. They divorced in 1972. Sam, a real-estate developer, died in 1996 after years of alcoholism. The senior Griffith&#x27;s second wife was Solica Cassuto, a Greek actress. They were married from 1973 to 1981. Griffith and Cindi Knight married on April 12, 1983, after they met while she was a cast member of &quot;The Lost Colony&quot;. They remained married until Griffith&#x27;s death. Griffith also had three granddaughters through his daughter Dixie.

According to the 2015 book &quot;Andy &amp; Don: The Making of a Friendship and a Classic American TV Show&quot;, Aneta Corsaut and the married Griffith had an ongoing affair throughout the five years they worked together on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;; the affair was an open secret amongst the cast and crew.

===Health and death===
Griffith&#x27;s first serious health problem was in April 1983 when he was diagnosed with Guillain–Barré syndrome and could not walk for seven months because of paralysis from the knees down.

On May 9, 2000, he underwent quadruple heart-bypass surgery at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia.

After a fall, Griffith underwent hip surgery on September 5, 2007, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.

On July 3, 2012, Griffith died at his Roanoke Island home in Manteo, North Carolina, from a heart attack he had the day before; he was 86. His death certificate listed hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia as underlying health conditions. In accordance with prior arrangements, no services were held at the time, and he was buried in a cemetery on the island within five hours of his death.

<doc id="113139" wikidata="Q526035" url="?curid=113139" title="The Andy Griffith Show">
<text>The Andy Griffith Show is an American sitcom television series that was aired on CBS from October 3, 1960, to April 1, 1968, with a total of 249 half-hour episodes spanning eight seasons—159 in black and white and 90 in color.

The series originated from an episode of &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot;. It stars Andy Griffith as Andy Taylor, the widowed sheriff of Mayberry, North Carolina, a fictional community of roughly 2,000–5,000 people. Other major characters include Andy&#x27;s lifelong friend, the well-meaning and enthusiastic but bumbling deputy, Barney Fife (Don Knotts), Andy&#x27;s aunt and housekeeper, Bee Taylor (Frances Bavier) and Andy&#x27;s young son, Opie (Ron Howard). The townspeople round out the regular cast. Regarding the tone of the show, Griffith said that despite a contemporary setting, the show evoked nostalgia, saying in a &quot;Today&quot; interview, &quot;Well, though we never said it, and though it was shot in the &#x27;60s, it had a feeling of the &#x27;30s. It was when we were doing it, of a time gone by.&quot;

The series was never placed lower than seventh in the Nielsen ratings, ending its final season at number one. The only other shows to end their runs at the top of the ratings are &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; (1957) and &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (1998). On separate occasions, it has been ranked by &quot;TV Guide&quot; as the 9th- and 13th-best series in American television history. Though neither Griffith nor the show won awards during its eight-season run, co-stars Knotts and Bavier accumulated a combined total of six Emmy Awards. The series spawned its own spin-off — &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot; (1964–1969) – and a reunion telemovie, &quot;Return to Mayberry&quot; (1986).

After the eighth season, when Griffith left the series, it was retitled &quot;Mayberry, R.F.D.,&quot; with Ken Berry and Buddy Foster replacing Griffith and Howard in new roles. In the new format, it ran for 78 episodes, ending in 1971 after three seasons. Reruns of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; are often shown on TV Land, MeTV, The CW, and SundanceTV. On those channels, the episodes are edited to make room for more commercials, but some airings on SundanceTV air the full uncut versions. The complete series is available on DVD and Blu-ray and intermittently on streaming video services such as Amazon Prime and Paramount+. Mayberry Days, an annual festival celebrating the sitcom, is held each year in Griffith&#x27;s hometown, Mount Airy, North Carolina.

==Origin==
Sheldon Leonard—producer of &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot;—and Danny Thomas hired veteran comedy writer Arthur Stander (who had written many of the &quot;Danny Thomas&quot; episodes) to create a pilot show for Griffith, featuring him as justice of the peace and newspaper editor in a small town. At the time, Broadway, film, and radio star Griffith was interested in attempting a television role, and the William Morris Agency told Leonard that Griffith&#x27;s rural background and previous rustic characterizations were suited to the part. After conferences between Leonard and Griffith in New York City, Griffith flew to Los Angeles and filmed the episode. On February 15, 1960, &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot; episode &quot;Danny Meets Andy Griffith&quot; aired. In the episode, Griffith played the fictional Sheriff Andy Taylor of Mayberry, North Carolina, who arrests Danny Williams (Thomas&#x27; character) for running a stop sign. Future players in &quot;The Andy Griffith Show,&quot; Bavier and Howard, appeared in the episode as townspeople Henrietta Perkins and Opie Taylor (the sheriff&#x27;s son), respectively. General Foods, sponsor of &quot;The Danny Thomas Show,&quot; had first access to the spin-off and committed to it immediately. On October 3, 1960, at 9:30 p.m., &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; made its debut.

==Production==

The sitcom&#x27;s production team included producers Aaron Ruben (1960–1965) and Bob Ross (1965–1968). First-season writers (many of whom worked in pairs) included Jack Elinson, Charles Stewart, Arthur Stander, and Frank Tarloff (as &quot;David Adler&quot;), Benedict Freedman and John Fenton Murray, Leo Solomon and Ben Gershman, and Jim Fritzell and Everett Greenbaum. During season six, Greenbaum and Fritzell left the show. Ruben departed for &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot;, a show he owned in part. Writer Harvey Bullock left after season six. Bob Sweeney directed the first three seasons save the premiere.
The show was filmed at Desilu Studios, with exteriors filmed at Forty Acres in Culver City, California. Woodsy locales were filmed north of Beverly Hills at Franklin Canyon, including the opening credits and closing credits with Andy and Opie walking to and from &quot;the fishin&#x27; hole&quot;. Don Knotts, who knew Griffith professionally (they had appeared together in both the Broadway and film versions of &quot;No Time for Sergeants&quot;) and had seen &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot; episode, called Griffith during the developmental stages of the show and suggested the Sheriff character needed a deputy and comic sideman; Griffith agreed. Knotts auditioned for the show&#x27;s creator and executive producer, Sheldon Leonard, and was offered a five-year contract playing Barney Fife. The show&#x27;s theme music was composed by Earle Hagen, who also performed the whistling in the opening and closing credits. Herbert Spencer was credited by the BMI as &quot;co-composer&quot;, but was not involved with the composition of the theme. In 1961, actor Everett Sloane, who also guest starred as Jubal Foster in the episode &quot;The Keeper of the Flame&quot;, wrote lyrics for the theme after he learned it did not have any. This vocal version of the theme was renamed &quot;The Fishin&#x27; Hole&quot; and first appeared on an LP album of music from the show. One of the show&#x27;s tunes, &quot;The Mayberry March&quot;, was reworked several times in different tempo, styles, and orchestrations as background music. The show&#x27;s sole sponsor was General Foods, with promotional consideration paid for (in the form of cars) by Ford Motor Company (mentioned in the credits).

===Griffith&#x27;s development of Andy Taylor===
Initially, Griffith played Taylor as a heavy-handed unworldly country bumpkin, grinning from ear to ear and speaking in a hesitant, frantic but friendly manner. The style recalled that used in the delivery of his popular monologues such as &quot;What It Was, Was Football.&quot; He gradually abandoned the &quot;rustic Taylor&quot; and developed a serious and thoughtful characterization. Producer Aaron Ruben recalled: He was being that marvelously funny character from &quot;No Time for Sergeants,&quot; Will Stockdale [a role Griffith played on stage and in film] ... One day he said, &quot;My God, I just realized that I&#x27;m the straight man. I&#x27;m playing straight to all these kooks around me.&quot; He didn&#x27;t like himself [in first year reruns] ... and in the next season he changed, becoming this Lincolnesque character. As Griffith stopped portraying some of the sheriff&#x27;s more unsophisticated character traits and mannerisms, creating his own problems and troubles was impossible in the manner of other central sitcom characters such as Lucy in &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; or Archie Bunker in &quot;All in the Family&quot;, whose problems were the result of their temperaments, philosophies, and attitudes. Consequently, the characters around Taylor were employed to create the problems and troubles, with rock-solid Taylor stepping in as problem solver, mediator, advisor, disciplinarian, and counselor.

==Premise and characters==


The series revolves around Andy Taylor (Andy Griffith), the sheriff of the sleepy, slow-paced, fictional community of Mayberry, North Carolina. His laid-back but level-headed approach to law enforcement makes him the scourge of local moonshiners and out-of-town criminals, while his abilities to settle community problems with commonsense advice, mediation, and conciliation make him popular with his fellow citizens. His professional life, however, is complicated by the repeated gaffes of his inept deputy, Barney Fife (Don Knotts). Barney is Andy&#x27;s cousin and best friend. At home, widower Andy raises his young son Opie (Ronny Howard), assisted by his maiden aunt and housekeeper, Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier). Opie, though generally respectful and well-behaved, is also curious and adventuresome and tests his father&#x27;s parenting skills. Aunt Bee, meanwhile, is a wonderful cook and housekeeper, but her ill-considered romances and occasional quirks cause her nephew concern.

Andy&#x27;s friends and neighbors include, at various times, barber Floyd Lawson (Howard McNear; Walter Baldwin portrayed the role in the 1960 episode &quot;Stranger in Town&quot;), service station attendants and cousins Gomer Pyle (Jim Nabors) and Goober Pyle (George Lindsey), and local drunkard Otis Campbell (Hal Smith). There are two mayors over the course of the series: Mayor Pike (Dick Elliott) is more relaxed, but often indecisive, while Mayor Roy Stoner (Parley Baer) has a more assertive personality. Other semi-regulars include townswoman Clara Edwards (Hope Summers), Barney&#x27;s sweetheart Thelma Lou (Betty Lynn) and Andy&#x27;s schoolteacher sweetheart Helen Crump (Aneta Corsaut). Ellie Walker (Elinor Donahue) is Andy&#x27;s girlfriend in the first season, while Peggy McMillan (Joanna Moore) is a nurse who becomes his girlfriend in season 3. In the color seasons, County Clerk Howard Sprague (Jack Dodson) and handyman Emmett Clark (Paul Hartman) appear regularly, while Barney&#x27;s replacement, Deputy Warren Ferguson (Jack Burns), appears in about half of season six.

Ernest T. Bass made his first appearance in episode 94 (&quot;Mountain Wedding&quot;), as well as four later episodes. The actor who portrayed him, Howard Morris, also played George, the television repairman in episode 140 (&quot;Andy and Helen Have Their Day&quot;) and two uncredited voice roles, as Leonard Blush and a radio announcer. Morris also directed a total of eight episodes of the show, none while portraying Ernest T. Bass.

Unseen characters such as telephone operator Sarah, and Barney&#x27;s love interest, local diner waitress Juanita Beasley, as mentioned in the first season, are often referenced. The show&#x27;s announcer for the first five seasons, Colin Male, portrayed Game Warden Peterson in episode 140 (&quot;Andy and Helen Have Their Day&quot;).

In the series&#x27; last few episodes, farmer Sam Jones (Ken Berry) debuts and later becomes the lead of the retitled show, &quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot; Don Knotts, Aneta Corsaut, Jack Dodson, and Betty Lynn also appeared on Griffith&#x27;s later show, &quot;Matlock&quot;.

==Episodes==
The show comprises eight full seasons and 249 episodes—159 episodes in black and white (seasons 1–5) and 90 in color (seasons 6–8). Griffith appears in all 249 episodes with Howard appearing in 202, Bavier appearing in 175, and Knotts appearing in 141. Only Griffith, Howard, Bavier, Knotts and Hope Summers appeared in all eight seasons. Knotts left the show at the end of season five to pursue a career in films (on the show, it is explained that he takes a job as a detective with the Raleigh Police Department) but returned to make five guest appearances as Barney in seasons six through eight. His last appearance is in the final season, in a story about a summit meeting with Soviet dignitaries &quot;ranked eleventh among single comedy programs most watched in television between 1960 and 1984, with an audience of thirty-three and a half million.&quot;

==Reruns, spinoffs and reunions==

In 1964, daytime reruns began airing during the fall season and the show has been in syndication since. The reruns were retitled &quot;Andy of Mayberry&quot; to distinguish the repeat episodes from the new episodes airing in primetime.

At the end of season four (May 1964), the backdoor pilot &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot; aired and the following September, the spinoff series &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot; debuted with Jim Nabors in the role of Gomer and Frank Sutton as drill instructor Sergeant Vince Carter.

In the last episodes of the eighth season, as Griffith was preparing to leave, the character Sam Jones, played by Ken Berry, was introduced as the new star and the series was retitled &quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot; Most of the cast members continued their original roles, with Bavier becoming Sam&#x27;s housekeeper. To create a smooth transition, Andy and Helen were married in the first episode with the new title and remained for a few additional episodes before leaving with a move to Raleigh, effectively ending their appearances.

After &quot;RFD&quot;″s cancellation in 1971, George Lindsey played Goober for many years on the popular country-variety show &quot;Hee Haw.&quot;

Goober, Barney and Emmett all made appearances in the series premiere of &quot;The New Andy Griffith Show,&quot; which starred Griffith as a similar but canonically different character, Mayor Andy Sawyer. All three characters treated Sawyer as if he were Andy Taylor. The series only lasted ten episodes.

In 1986, the reunion telemovie &quot;Return to Mayberry&quot; was broadcast with several cast members reprising their original roles. Absent, however, was Frances Bavier. She was living in Siler City, North Carolina in ill health and declined to participate. In the TV movie, Aunt Bee is portrayed as deceased (and in fact, Bavier did die three years later), with Andy visiting her grave. Also absent were Howard McNear, Paul Hartman, Jack Burns, and the cast members who were featured only in the &quot;Mayberry RFD&quot; seasons.

Griffith and Howard reprised their roles a final time for a Funny or Die skit supporting the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama.

In 1993, &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; had a Reunion Special which featured Andy Griffith, Don Knotts, Ron Howard, Jim Nabors, George Lindsey, and Jack Dodson.

In 2003, four surviving cast members (Griffith, Howard, Knotts, and Nabors) came together for a reunion special that featured the actors reminiscing about each other&#x27;s time on the show. The production was interspersed with archival footage and short filmed interviews with some of the other surviving cast members. This special was called &quot;The Andy Griffith Show: Back to Mayberry.&quot;

== Reception ==

===Ratings===

&quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; was a top ten hit through its entire run, never ranking lower than seventh place in the yearly ratings. A Nielsen study conducted during the show&#x27;s final season (1967–68) indicated the show ranked number one among blue collar workers followed by &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; and &quot;Gunsmoke.&quot; Among white collar workers, the show ranked third, following &quot;Saturday Movies&quot; and &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;. The final season of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; was the number one ranked show on television. Other shows to have accomplished this include &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and &quot;Seinfeld.&quot; In 1998, the year &quot;Seinfeld&quot; ended, more than five million people a day watched the show&#x27;s reruns on 120 stations.

==Merchandise and pop culture==
Very little merchandise was produced for &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; during its original run, a peculiarity for a hit TV show in the 1960s. One theory for the lack of merchandise is that the show&#x27;s producers, Griffith in particular, wanted to protect its image as a realistic and thoughtful offering and keep the public&#x27;s focus on the show itself rather than its branding. Among the handful of merchandise released during the show&#x27;s first run, Dell Comics published two &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; comic books, one drawn by Henry Scarpelli, the other by Bill Fraccio. In 2004, copies in near-mint condition were priced in excess of $500 each. There was also a soundtrack album, two coloring books, and a 1966 Grape-Nuts cereal box with a photo of Griffith in character as Sheriff Andy Taylor beside a lemon pie recipe on the back. The show&#x27;s enduring popularity has spawned considerable merchandise during the decades following its cancellation, including board games, bobblehead dolls, kitchenware, and books. In 2007, a line of canned foods inspired by the series was made available in grocery stores across America.

Griffith&#x27;s hometown of Mount Airy, North Carolina, annually hosts a week-long &quot;Mayberry Days&quot; celebration featuring concerts, parades and appearances by the show&#x27;s players.

In 2003, the country band Rascal Flatts released the song &quot;Mayberry&quot; and many of the lyrics pay tribute to the show. The 1989 song &quot;Floyd the Barber&quot; by American grunge band Nirvana references multiple characters from the show, including Floyd, Barney, Opie, Andy, and Aunt Bee. Canadian rapper and singer Drake references the show&#x27;s theme song in his 2009 track &quot;Best I Ever Had&quot;. 

The cable television network TV Land erected bronze statues of Andy and Opie in Mount Airy and Raleigh, North Carolina (&quot;see:&quot; Pullen Park).

The Taylor Home Inn in Clear Lake, Wisconsin, is a bed-and-breakfast modeled after the Taylor Home. The Mayberry Cafe in Danville, Indiana, features Aunt Bee&#x27;s Fried Chicken and a replica of Andy&#x27;s Ford Galaxie police car.

In 2021, the original feature film &quot;Mayberry Man&quot; was produced by children of actors from &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; featuring Mayberry tribute artists set in a fictitious modern-day Mayberry.

==Home media==
In the late 1980s, Premier Promotions released various episodes on VHS. Most tapes had either two or four episodes. In the early to mid-1990s, United American Video (under license from the show&#x27;s then-syndicator Viacom Enterprises) released VHS tapes of various episodes. They either had two or three episodes. These compilations were culled from episodes early in the show&#x27;s run that had lapsed into the public domain; these episodes continue to be circulated on unofficial video releases.

Starting in 2004, Paramount Home Entertainment (under the CBS Home Entertainment label starting in 2006) released all eight seasons as single-season packages on Region 1 DVD. &quot;The Andy Griffith Show: The Complete Series&quot; was first released as a 40-disc boxed set in 2007. In addition to all 249 episodes of the series, its bonus features included the episode &quot;Danny Meets Andy Griffith&quot; from &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot; which served as the pilot, the episode &quot;Opie Joins the Marines&quot; from &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot; which featured Ron Howard and the 95-minute, made-for-television comedy film &quot;Return to Mayberry&quot;. In 2016, &quot;The Andy Griffith Show: The Complete Series&quot; was repackaged and released again as a 39-disc set that featured all 249 episodes of the series but did not include the bonus feature disc. The last 16 episodes of the third season, which lapsed into the public domain after CBS neglected to file copyright renewals on the episodes in 1989, are available on discount DVDs. The 2007 lawsuit &quot;CBS Operations Inc v. Reel Funds International Inc.&quot; ruled that the episodes in question were derivative works based on the copyrighted episodes even though the episodes themselves were not under copyright and granted CBS indirect copyright over the public domain episodes; the ruling enjoined Reel Funds International, a public domain distributor, from selling DVDs with those episodes within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas.

Note: The Region 1 release of &quot;The Third Season&quot; contains two episodes edited for syndication: &quot;The Darlings Are Coming&quot;—which had several scenes cut—and &quot;Barney Mends a Broken Heart&quot;, which had its epilogue cut.

<text>The Pas ( ) is a town in Manitoba, Canada, at the confluence of the Pasquia River and the Saskatchewan River and surrounded by the unorganized Northern Region of the province. It is approximately northwest of the provincial capital, Winnipeg, and from the border of Saskatchewan. It is sometimes still called &quot;Paskoyac&quot; by locals after the first trading post, called Fort Paskoya, constructed in the 1740s by French and Canadian traders. The Pasquia River begins in the Pasquia Hills in east central Saskatchewan. The French in 1795 knew the river as Basquiau.

Known as &quot;The Gateway to the North&quot;, The Pas is a multi-industry northern Manitoba town serving the surrounding region. The main components of the region&#x27;s economy are agriculture, forestry, commercial fishing, tourism, transportation, and services (especially health and education). The main employer is a paper mill operated by Canadian Kraft Paper Industries Ltd. The Pas contains one of the two main campuses of the University College of the North.

The Pas is bordered by the Rural Municipality of Kelsey, as well as part of the Opaskwayak Cree Nation.

== History ==

The area&#x27;s original inhabitants are the Swampy Cree.

The first European recorded to encounter the Cree was Henry Kelsey, an employee of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. He travelled through the area between 1690 and 1692 on his way to the Canadian prairies.

During the years of New France, La Vérendrye, the first western military commander, directed the construction of Fort Paskoya near here. It was named after the people of the Pasquia River. For years the settlement was called Pascoyac, sometimes shortened to Le Pas.

In 1904, The Pas Indian Band set up a sawmill on Mission Island in the Saskatchewan River. Soon after, the band was forced to surrender their reserve lands south of the river, including the areas around the site of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trading post and the Anglican Church Mission, to make way for the Hudson Bay Railway and development of the Town of The Pas.

By 1908, the band reopened their sawmill north of the river, and in 1912, the Town of The Pas was incorporated and The Pas Indian Band changed its name to Opaskwayak Cree Nation.

Between 1906 and 1910, Herman Finger set up the Finger Lumber Company in the area, and created a village called Fingerville for the company&#x27;s workers. When the Town of The Pas was created in 1912, Fingerville was absorbed into The Pas, and Herman Finger became The Pas&#x27;s first mayor.

Also in 1912, the community was transferred from Keewatin (a district of the Northwest Territories) to Manitoba as part of the &quot;Manitoba Boundaries Extension Act&quot;.

The area today is composed of three distinct communities: the Town of The Pas, the Opaskwayak Cree Nation, and the Rural Municipality of Kelsey.

The history of the town and the region may be seen at the Sam Waller Museum, in the old courthouse in downtown The Pas.

The son of former Husky star defenceman Jack Giles, Curt Giles, had a career in the NHL with New York Rangers, St. Louis, and Minnesota. The Pas native Murray Anderson was the first known locally born player to make the NHL, with Washington Capitals in the 1970s. Warren Harrison, younger brother of ex-Husky Roger Harrison, was drafted 53rd overall by the Oakland Seals in the 1969 NHL amateur draft.

The Pas Teepees were baseball champions in the Polar League in 1959. The team included several members of the Huskies, and were inducted into the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.

==Government==
The Pas is governed by a mayor and six councilors who are elected by residents. The mayor is Andre Murphy.

The region is represented in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as part of The Pas-Kameesak riding. Its current provincial representative is New Democratic Party (NDP) Member of the Legislative Assembly Amanda Lathlin. She is the daughter of Oscar Lathlin, who had represented the riding from 1990 until his death in November 2008. Amanda Lathlin has served as an MLA since a by-election on April 22, 2015, for The Pas; she is the first First Nations woman ever elected to the Manitoba legislature.

In the House of Commons of Canada, The Pas is part of the Churchill—Keewatinook Aski riding. Its current federal representative is NDP Member of Parliament Niki Ashton. She has served as MP since the 2008 Canadian federal election.

<doc id="113143" wikidata="Q231886" url="?curid=113143" title="Aphra Behn">
<text>Aphra Behn (; bapt. 14 December 1640 – 16 April 1689) was an English playwright, poet, prose writer and translator from the Restoration era. As one of the first English women to earn her living by her writing, she broke cultural barriers and served as a literary role model for later generations of women authors. Rising from obscurity, she came to the notice of Charles II, who employed her as a spy in Antwerp. Upon her return to London and a probable brief stay in debtors&#x27; prison, she began writing for the stage. She belonged to a coterie of poets and famous libertines such as John Wilmot, Lord Rochester. Behn wrote under the pastoral pseudonym Astrea. During the turbulent political times of the Exclusion Crisis, she wrote an epilogue and prologue that brought her legal trouble; she thereafter devoted most of her writing to prose genres and translations. A staunch supporter of the Stuart line, Behn declined an invitation from Bishop Burnet to write a welcoming poem to the new king William III. She died shortly after.

She is remembered in Virginia Woolf&#x27;s &quot;A Room of One&#x27;s Own&quot;: &quot;All women together ought to let flowers fall upon the tomb of Aphra Behn which is, most scandalously but rather appropriately, in Westminster Abbey, for it was she who earned them the right to speak their minds.&quot; Her grave is not included in the Poets&#x27; Corner but lies in the East Cloister near the steps to the church.

Her best-known works are &quot;Oroonoko: or, the Royal Slave&quot;, sometimes described as an early novel, and the play &quot;The Rover&quot;.

==Life and work==

===Versions of her early life===
Information regarding Behn&#x27;s life is scant, especially regarding her early years. This may be due to intentional obscuring on Behn&#x27;s part. One version of Behn&#x27;s life tells that she was born to a barber named John Amis and his wife Amy; she is occasionally referred to as &quot;Aphra Amis Behn&quot;. Another story has Behn born to a couple named Cooper. &quot;The Histories and Novels of the Late Ingenious Mrs. Behn&quot; (1696) states that Behn was born to Bartholomew Johnson, a barber, and Elizabeth Denham, a wet-nurse. Colonel Thomas Colepeper, the only person who claimed to have known her as a child, wrote in &quot;Adversaria&quot; that she was born at &quot;Sturry or Canterbury&quot; to a Mr Johnson and that she had a sister named Frances. Another contemporary, Anne Finch, wrote that Behn was born in Wye in Kent, the &quot;Daughter to a Barber&quot;. In some accounts the profile of her father fits Eaffrey Johnson. Although not much is known about her early childhood, one of her biographers, Janet Todd, believes that the common religious upbringing at the time could have heavily influenced much of her work. She argued that, throughout Behn&#x27;s writings, her experiences in church were not of religious fervour, but instead chances for her to explore her sexual desires, desires that will later be shown through her plays. In one of her last plays she writes, &quot;I have been at the Chapel; and seen so many Beaus, such a Number of Plumeys, I cou&#x27;d not tell which I shou&#x27;d look on the most...&quot;.

Another version of her life says she was born as Aphra Johnson, daughter to Bartholomew and Elizabeth Johnson of Harbledown in Kent; her brother Edward died when he was six and a half years old. She is said to have been betrothed to a man named John Halse in 1657. It is suggested that this association with the Halse family is what gave her family the colonial connections that allowed them to travel to Suriname. Her correspondence with William Scot, son of parliamentarian Thomas Scot, in the 1660s seems to corroborate her stories of her time in the American colony.

=== Education ===
Although Behn&#x27;s writings show some form of education, it is not clear how she obtained the education that she did. It was somewhat taboo for women at the time to receive a formal education, Janet Todd notes. Although some aristocratic girls in the past had been able to receive some form of education, that was most likely not the case for Aphra Behn, based on the time she lived. Self-tuition was practised by European women during the 17th century, but it relied on the parents to allow that to happen. She most likely spent time copying poems and other writings, which not only inspired her but educated her. Aphra was not alone in her quest of self-tuition during this time period, and there are other notable women, such as the first female medical doctor Dorothea Leporin who made efforts to self-educate. In some of her plays, Aphra Behn shows disdain towards this English ideal of not educating women formally. She also, though, seemed to believe that learning Greek and Latin, two of the classical languages at the time, was not as important as many authors thought it to be. She may have been influenced by another writer named Francis Kirkman who also lacked knowledge of Greek or Latin, who said &quot;you shall not find my English, Greek, here; nor hard cramping Words, such as will stop you in the middle of your Story to consider what is meant by them...&quot;. Later in life, Aphra would make similar gestures to ideas revolving around formal education.

Behn was born during the buildup of the English Civil War, a child of the political tensions of the time. One version of Behn&#x27;s story has her travelling with a Bartholomew Johnson to the small English colony of Surinam (later captured by the Dutch). He was said to die on the journey, with his wife and children spending some months in the country, though there is no evidence of this. During this trip Behn said she met an African slave leader, whose story formed the basis for one of her most famous works, &quot;Oroonoko&quot;. It is possible that she acted as a spy in the colony. There is little verifiable evidence to confirm any one story. In &quot;Oroonoko&quot;, Behn gives herself the position of narrator and her first biographer accepted the assumption that Behn was the daughter of the lieutenant general of Surinam, as in the story. There is little evidence that this was the case, and none of her contemporaries acknowledge any aristocratic status. Her correspondence with Thomas Scot during the time of her stay in Surinam seems to provide evidence for her stay there. Also, later in her career when she found herself facing financial troubles in the Netherlands, her mother is said to have had audience with the King in an attempt to secure Aphra&#x27;s way home, implying there may have been some form of connection with aristocracy, however small. There is also no evidence that Oroonoko existed as an actual person or that any such slave revolt, as is featured in the story, really happened.

Writer Germaine Greer has called Behn &quot;a palimpsest; she has scratched herself out,&quot; and biographer Janet Todd noted that Behn &quot;has a lethal combination of obscurity, secrecy and staginess which makes her an uneasy fit for any narrative, speculative or factual. She is not so much a woman to be unmasked as an unending combination of masks&quot;. Her name is not mentioned in tax or church records. During her lifetime she was also known as Ann Behn, Mrs Behn, agent 160 and Astrea.

Shortly after her supposed return to England from Surinam in 1664, Behn may have married Johan Behn (also written as Johann and John Behn). He may have been a merchant of German or Dutch extraction, possibly from Hamburg. He died or the couple separated soon after 1664; however, from this point the writer used &quot;Mrs Behn&quot; as her professional name. In correspondence, she occasionally signed her name as Behne or Beane.

Behn may have had a Catholic upbringing. She once commented that she was &quot;designed for a nun,&quot; and the fact that she had so many Catholic connections, such as Henry Neville who was later arrested for his Catholicism, would have aroused suspicions during the anti-Catholic fervour of the 1680s. She was a monarchist, and her sympathy for the Stuarts, and particularly for the Catholic Duke of York may be demonstrated by her dedication of her play &quot;The Second Part of the Rover&quot; to him after he had been exiled for the second time. Behn was dedicated to the restored King Charles II. As political parties emerged during this time, Behn became a Tory supporter.

By 1666, Behn had become attached to the court, possibly through the influence of Thomas Culpeper and other associates. She has also been placed in Westminster, in lodgings close to Sir Philip Howard of Naworth, and that it was his connections to John Halsall and Duke Ablemarle that led to her eventual mission in the Netherlands. The Second Anglo-Dutch War had broken out between England and the Netherlands in 1665, and she was recruited as a political spy in Antwerp on behalf of King Charles II, possibly under the auspices of courtier Thomas Killigrew. This is the first well-documented account we have of her activities. Her code name is said to have been &quot;Astrea&quot;, a name under which she later published many of her writings. Her chief role was to establish an intimacy with William Scot, son of Thomas Scot, a regicide who had been executed in 1660. Scot was believed to be ready to become a spy in the English service and to report on the doings of the English exiles who were plotting against the King. Behn arrived in Bruges in July 1666, probably with two others, as London was wracked with plague and fire. Behn&#x27;s job was to turn Scot into a double agent, but there is evidence that Scot betrayed her to the Dutch.

Behn&#x27;s exploits were not profitable, however; the cost of living shocked her, and she was left unprepared. One month after arrival, she pawned her jewellery. King Charles was slow in paying (if he paid at all), either for her services or for her expenses whilst abroad. Money had to be borrowed so that Behn could return to London, where a year&#x27;s petitioning of Charles for payment was unsuccessful. It may be that she was never paid by the crown. A warrant was issued for her arrest, but there is no evidence it was served or that she went to prison for her debt, though apocryphally it is often given as part of her history.
Forced by debt and her husband&#x27;s death, Behn began to work for the King&#x27;s Company and the Duke&#x27;s Company players as a scribe. She had, however, written poetry up until this point. While she is recorded to have written before she adopted her debt, John Palmer said in a review of her works that, &quot;Mrs. Behn wrote for a livelihood. Playwriting was her refuge from starvation and a debtor&#x27;s prison.&quot; The theatres that had been closed under Cromwell were now re-opening under Charles II, plays enjoying a revival. Under Charles, prevailing Puritan ethics were reversed in the fashionable society of London. The King associated with playwrights that poured scorn on marriage and the idea of consistency in love. Among the King&#x27;s favourites was the Earl of Rochester John Wilmot, who became famous for his cynical libertinism.

In 1613 Lady Elizabeth Cary had published &quot;The Tragedy of Miriam&quot;, in the 1650s Margaret Cavendish published two volumes of plays, and in 1663 a translation of Corneille&#x27;s &quot;Pompey&quot; by Katherine Philips was performed in Dublin and London. Women had been excluded from performing on the public stage before the English Civil War, but in Restoration England professional actresses played the women&#x27;s parts. In 1668, plays by women began to be staged in London.

Behn&#x27;s first play &quot;The Forc&#x27;d Marriage&quot; was a romantic tragicomedy on arranged marriages and was staged by the Duke&#x27;s Company in September 1670. The performance ran for six nights, which was regarded as a good run for an unknown author. Six months later Behn&#x27;s play &quot;The Amorous Prince&quot; was successfully staged. Again, Behn used the play to comment on the harmful effects of arranged marriages. Behn did not hide the fact that she was a woman, instead she made a point of it. When in 1673 the Dorset Garden Theatre staged &quot;The Dutch Lover&quot;, critics sabotaged the play on the grounds that the author was a woman. Behn tackled the critics head on in &quot;Epistle to the Reader&quot;. She argued that women had been held back by their unjust exclusion from education, not their lack of ability. Critics of Behn were provided with ammunition because of her public liaison with John Hoyle, a bisexual lawyer who scandalised his contemporaries.

After her third play, &quot;The Dutch Lover&quot;, failed, Behn falls off the public record for three years. It is speculated that she went travelling again, possibly in her capacity as a spy. She gradually moved towards comic works, which proved more commercially successful, publishing four plays in close succession. In 1676–77, she published &quot;Abdelazer&quot;, &quot;The Town-Fopp&quot; and &quot;The Rover&quot;. In early 1678 &quot;Sir Patient Fancy&quot; was published. This succession of box-office successes led to frequent attacks on Behn. She was attacked for her private life, the morality of her plays was questioned and she was accused of plagiarising &quot;The Rover&quot;. Behn countered these public attacks in the prefaces of her published plays. In the preface to &quot;Sir Patient Fancy&quot; she argued that she was being singled out because she was a woman, while male playwrights were free to live the most scandalous lives and write bawdy plays.

By the late 1670s Behn was among the leading playwrights of England. During the 1670s and 1680s she was one of the most productive playwrights in Britain, second only to Poet Laureate John Dryden. Her plays were staged frequently and attended by the King. Behn became friends with notable writers of the day, including John Dryden, Elizabeth Barry, John Hoyle, Thomas Otway and Edward Ravenscroft, and was acknowledged as a part of the circle of the Earl of Rochester. &quot;The Rover&quot; became a favourite at the King&#x27;s court.

Because Charles II had no heir, a prolonged political crisis ensued. Behn became heavily involved in the political debate about the succession. Mass hysteria commenced as in 1678 the rumoured Popish Plot suggested the King should be replaced with his Roman Catholic brother James. Political parties developed, the Whigs wanted to exclude James, while the Tories did not believe succession should be altered in any way. Behn supported the Tory position and in the two years between 1681 and 1682 produced five plays to discredit the Whigs. Behn often used her writings to attack the parliamentary Whigs claiming, &quot;In public spirits call’d, good o&#x27; th&#x27; Commonwealth... So tho&#x27; by different ways the fever seize...in all &#x27;tis one and the same mad disease.&quot; This was Behn&#x27;s reproach to parliament which had denied the king funds. The London audience, mainly Tory sympathisers, attended the plays in large numbers. But a warrant was issued for Behn&#x27;s arrest on the order of King Charles II when she criticized James Scott, Duke of Monmouth, the illegitimate son of the King, in the epilogue to the anonymously published &quot;Romulus and Hersilia&quot; (1682). Charles II eventually dissolved the Cavalier Parliament and James II succeeded him in 1685.

===Final years and death===

In her last four years, Behn&#x27;s health began to fail, beset by poverty and debt, but she continued to write ferociously, though it became increasingly hard for her to hold a pen.

As audience numbers declined, theatres staged mainly old works to save costs. Nevertheless, Behn staged &quot;The Luckey Chance&quot; in 1686. In response to the criticism levelled at the play, she articulated a long and passionate defence of women writers in the preface of the play when it was published in the following year. Her play &quot;The Emperor of the Moon&quot; was staged and published in 1687; it became one of her longest-running plays.

In the 1680s, she began to publish prose. Her first prose work might have been the three-part &quot;Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister&quot;, anonymously published between 1684 and 1687. The novels were inspired by a contemporary scandal, which saw Lord Grey elope with his sister-in-law Lady Henrietta Berkeley. At the time of publication, &quot;Love-Letters&quot; was very popular and eventually went through more than 16 editions before 1800.

She published five prose works under her own name: &quot;La Montre: or, the Lover&#x27;s Watch&quot; (1686), &quot;The Fair Jilt&quot; (1688), &quot;Oroonoko&quot;: &quot;or, The Royal Slave&quot; (1688), &quot;The History of the Nun&quot; (1689) and &quot;The Lucky Mistake&quot; (1689). &quot;Oroonoko&quot;, her best-known prose work, was published less than a year before her death. It is the story of the enslaved Oroonoko and his love Imoinda, possibly based on Behn&#x27;s travel to Surinam twenty years earlier.

Behn composed &quot;Oenone to Paris&quot;, a reworking of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Heroides,&quot; for John Dryden and Jacob Tonson&#x27;s collection &quot;Ovid&#x27;s Epistles Translated by Several Hands&quot;, published in 1680&quot;.&quot; Unlike other entries to the collection, Behn significantly deviated from her source, incorporating motives from more of Ovid&#x27;s epistles, and offering a more sympathetic portrayal of Oenone than is found in Ovid or other retellings of the myth. Behn&#x27;s free style of translation led to attacks by her contemporaries, most notably Matthew Prior, who famously referred to her as &#x27;blind Translatress Behn&#x27; in a markedly misogynistic critique of the work. As the collection&#x27;s only female contributor, Behn&#x27;s involvement in &quot;Ovid&#x27;s Epistles&quot; presents an unusual incursion into the male-dominated field of classical translation, and it has been suggested that her contribution paved the way for more women to produce their own translations of the classics.

She also translated from the French, publishing translations of Tallement, La Rochefoucauld, Fontenelle and Brilhac. The two translations of Fontenelle&#x27;s work were: &quot;A Discovery of New Worlds&quot; (&quot;Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes&quot;), a popularisation of astronomy written as a novel in a form similar to her own work, but with her new, religiously oriented preface; and &quot;The History of Oracles&quot; (&quot;Histoire des Oracles&quot;). She translated Brilhac&#x27;s &quot;Agnes de Castro&quot;. In her final days, she translated &quot;Of Trees&quot; (&quot;Sylva&quot;), the sixth and final book of Abraham Cowley&#x27;s &quot;Six Books of Plants&quot; (&quot;Plantarum libri sex&quot;)&quot;.&quot;

She died on 16 April 1689, and was buried in the East Cloister of Westminster Abbey. The inscription on her tombstone reads: &quot;Here lies a Proof that Wit can never be Defence enough against Mortality.&quot; She was quoted as stating that she had led a &quot;life dedicated to pleasure and poetry.&quot;

==Legacy and re-evaluation==
Following Behn&#x27;s death, new female dramatists such as Delarivier Manley, Mary Pix, Susanna Centlivre and Catherine Trotter acknowledged Behn as their most vital predecessor, who opened up public space for women writers. Three posthumous collections of her prose, including a number of previously unpublished pieces attributed to her, were published by the bookseller Samuel Briscoe: &quot;The Histories and Novels of the Late Ingenious Mrs. Behn&quot; (1696), &quot;All the Histories and Novels Written by the Late Ingenious Mrs. Behn&quot; (1698) and &quot;Histories, Novels, and Translations Written by the Most Ingenious Mrs. Behn&quot; (1700). Greer considers Briscoe to have been an unreliable source and it&#x27;s possible that not all of these works were written by Behn.

Until the mid-20th century Behn was repeatedly dismissed as a morally depraved minor writer and her literary work was marginalised and often dismissed outright. In the 18th century her literary work was scandalised as lewd by Thomas Brown, William Wycherley, Richard Steele and John Duncombe. Alexander Pope penned the famous lines &quot;The stage how loosely does Astrea tread, Who fairly puts all characters to bed!&quot;. In the 19th century Mary Hays, Matilda Betham, Alexander Dyce, Jane Williams and Julia Kavanagh decided that Behn&#x27;s writings were unfit to read, because they were corrupt and deplorable. Among the few critics who believed that Behn was an important writer were Leigh Hunt, William Forsyth and William Henry Hudson.

The life and times of Behn were recounted by a long line of biographers, among them Dyce, Edmund Gosse, Ernest Bernbaum, Montague Summers, Vita Sackville-West, Virginia Woolf, George Woodcock, William J. Cameron and Frederick Link.

Of Behn&#x27;s considerable literary output only &quot;Oroonoko&quot; was seriously considered by literary scholars. This book, published in 1688, is regarded as one of the first abolitionist and humanitarian novels published in the English language. In 1696 it was adapted for the stage by Thomas Southerne and continuously performed throughout the 18th century. In 1745 the novel was translated into French, going through seven French editions. It is credited as precursor to Jean-Jaques Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Discourses on Inequality&quot;.

In 1915, Montague Summers, an author of scholarly works on the English drama of the 17th century, published a six-volume collection of her work, in hopes of rehabilitating her reputation. Summers was fiercely passionate about the work of Behn and found himself incredibly devoted to the appreciation of 17th century literature.

Since the 1970s Behn&#x27;s literary works have been re-evaluated by feminist critics and writers. Behn was rediscovered as a significant female writer by Maureen Duffy, Angeline Goreau, Ruth Perry, Hilda Lee Smith, Moira Ferguson, Jane Spencer, Dale Spender, Elaine Hobby and Janet Todd. This led to the reprinting of her works. &quot;The Rover&quot; was republished in 1967, &quot;Oroonoko&quot; was republished in 1973, &quot;Love Letters between a Nobleman and His Sister&quot; was published again in 1987 and &quot;The Lucky Chance&quot; was reprinted in 1988. Felix Schelling wrote in &quot;The Cambridge History of English Literature&quot;, that she was &quot;a very gifted woman, compelled to write for bread in an age in which literature... catered habitually to the lowest and most depraved of human inclinations,&quot; and that, &quot;Her success depended upon her ability to write like a man.&quot; Edmund Gosse remarked that she was, &quot;...the George Sand of the Restoration&quot;.

The criticism of Behn&#x27;s poetry focuses on the themes of gender, sexuality, femininity, pleasure, and love. A feminist critique tends to focus on Behn&#x27;s inclusion of female pleasure and sexuality in her poetry, which was a radical concept at the time she was writing. Like her contemporary male libertines, she wrote freely about sex. In the infamous poem &quot;The Disappointment&quot; she wrote a comic account of male impotence from a woman&#x27;s perspective. Critics Lisa Zeitz and Peter Thoms contend that the poem &quot;playfully and wittily questions conventional gender roles and the structures of oppression which they support&quot;. One critic, Alison Conway, views Behn as instrumental to the formation of modern thought around the female gender and sexuality: &quot;Behn wrote about these subjects before the technologies of sexuality we now associate were in place, which is, in part, why she proves so hard to situate in the trajectories most familiar to us&quot;. Virginia Woolf wrote, in &quot;A Room of One&#x27;s Own&quot;:
All women together, ought to let flowers fall upon the grave of Aphra Behn... for it was she who earned them the right to speak their minds... Behn proved that money could be made by writing at the sacrifice, perhaps, of certain agreeable qualities; and so by degrees writing became not merely a sign of folly and a distracted mind but was of practical importance.
A statue to Canterbury born Aphra Behn was unveiled on 25 February 2025. In partnership with local organisations, Canterbury Christ Church University announced, in September 2023, plans for a year long celebration of Behn&#x27;s connection to Canterbury which would involve talks, a one-woman show, walks, and exhibitions, some hosted within the Canterbury Festival.

==In popular culture==
Behn&#x27;s life has been adapted for the stage in the 2014 play &quot;Empress of the Moon: The Lives of Aphra Behn&quot; by Chris Braak, and the 2015 play &quot;[exit Mrs Behn]&quot; or, &quot;The Leo Play&quot; by Christopher VanderArk. She is one of the characters in the 2010 play &quot;Or,&quot; by Liz Duffy Adams. Behn appears as a character in Daniel O&#x27;Mahony&#x27;s &quot;Newtons Sleep&quot;, in Philip José Farmer&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Labyrinth&quot; and &quot;Gods of Riverworld&quot;, in Molly Brown&#x27;s &quot;Invitation to a Funeral&quot; (1999), in Susanna Gregory’s &quot;Blood On The Strand&quot;, and in Diana Norman&#x27;s &quot;The Vizard Mask&quot;. She is referred to in Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s novel &quot;Desolation Island&quot;. Liz Duffy Adams produced &quot;Or,&quot;, a 2009 play about her life. The 2019 Big Finish Short Trip audio play &quot;The Astrea Conspiracy&quot; features Behn alongside The Doctor, voiced by actress Neve McIntosh. In recognition of her pioneering role in women&#x27;s literature, Behn was featured during the &quot;Her Story&quot; video tribute to notable women on U2&#x27;s North American tour in 2017 for the 30th anniversary of &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;.

<text>A barbarian is a person or tribe of people that is perceived to be primitive, savage and warlike. Many cultures have referred to other cultures as barbarians, sometimes out of misunderstanding and sometimes out of prejudice.

A &quot;barbarian&quot; may also be an individual reference to an aggressive, brutal, cruel, and insensitive person, particularly one who is also dim-witted, while cultures, customs and practices adopted by peoples and countries perceived to be primitive may be referred to as &quot;barbaric&quot;.

The term originates from the (; ). In Ancient Greece, the Greeks used the term not only for those who did not speak Greek and follow classical Greek customs, but also for Greek populations on the fringe of the Greek world with peculiar dialects. In Ancient Rome, the Romans adapted and applied the term to tribal non-Romans such as the Germanics, Celts, Iberians, Helvetii, Thracians, Illyrians, and Sarmatians. In the early modern period and sometimes later, the Byzantine Greeks used it for the Turks in a clearly pejorative manner.

The Greek word was borrowed into Arabic as well, under the form (), and used as an exonym by the Arab invaders to refer to the indigenous peoples of North Africa, known in English as Amazigh or Berbers, with the latter thereby being a cognate of the word &quot;barbarian&quot;.

Historically, the term &quot;barbarian&quot; has seen widespread use in English. Many peoples have dismissed alien cultures and even rival civilizations, because they were unrecognizably strange. For instance, the nomadic Turkic peoples north of the Black Sea, including the Pechenegs and the Kipchaks, were called barbarians by the Byzantines.

==Etymology==
===Ancient Greece===
The Ancient Greek name () &#x27;barbarian&#x27; was an antonym for () &#x27;citizen&#x27;, from () &#x27;city&#x27;. The earliest attested form of the word is the Mycenaean Greek , , written in Linear B syllabic script.

The Greeks used the term &quot;barbarian&quot; for all non-Greek-speaking people, including the Egyptians, Persians, Medes and Phoenicians, emphasizing their otherness. According to Greek writers, this was because the language they spoke sounded to Greeks like gibberish represented by the sounds &quot;bar..bar..;&quot; the alleged root of the word , which is an echomimetic or onomatopoeic word. In various occasions, the term was also used by Greeks, especially the Athenians, to deride other Greek tribes and states (such as Epirotes, Eleans, Boeotians and Aeolic-speakers) and also fellow Athenians in a pejorative and politically motivated manner. The term also carried a cultural dimension to its dual meaning. The verb (&quot;barbarízō&quot;) in ancient Greek meant to behave or talk like a barbarian, or to hold with the barbarians.

Plato (&quot;Statesman&quot; 262de) rejected the Greek–barbarian dichotomy as a logical absurdity on just such grounds: dividing the world into Greeks and non-Greeks told one nothing about the second group. Yet Plato used the term barbarian frequently in his seventh letter. In Homer&#x27;s works, the term appeared only once (&quot;Iliad&quot; 2.867), in the form (, ‘of incomprehensible speech’), used of the Carians fighting for Troy during the Trojan War. In general, the concept of &quot;barbaros&quot; did not figure largely in archaic literature before the 5th century BC. It has been suggested that the ‘barbarophonoi’ in the &quot;Iliad&quot; signifies not those who spoke a non-Greek language but simply those who spoke Greek badly.

A change occurred in the connotations of the word after the Greco-Persian Wars in the first half of the 5th century BC. Here a hasty coalition of Greeks defeated the vast Persian Empire. Indeed, in the Greek of this period &#x27;barbarian&#x27; is often used expressly to refer to Persians, who were enemies of the Greeks in this war.
===Ancient Rome===

The Romans used the term &quot;barbarus&quot; for uncivilised people, opposite to Greek or Roman, and in fact, it became a common term to refer to all foreigners among Romans after Augustus age (as, among the Greeks, after the Persian wars, the Persians), including the Germanic peoples, Persians, Gauls, Phoenicians and Carthaginians.

===Other cultures===
The Greek term &quot;barbaros&quot; was the etymological source for many words meaning &quot;barbarian&quot;, including English &quot;barbarian&quot;, which was first recorded in 16th century Middle English.

A word &quot;barbara- (बर्बर)&quot; is also found in the Sanskrit of ancient India, with the primary meaning of &quot;cruel&quot; and also &quot;stammering&quot; (बड़बड़), implying someone with an unfamiliar language. The Greek word &quot;barbaros&quot; is related to Sanskrit &quot;barbaras&quot; (stammering). This Indo-European root is also found in Latin &quot;balbutire / balbus&quot; for &quot;stammer / stammering&quot; (leading to Italian &quot;balbettare&quot;, Spanish &quot;balbucear&quot; and French &quot;balbutier&quot;) and Czech &quot;to stammer&quot;. The verb &quot;baṛbaṛānā&quot; in both contemporary Hindi (बड़बड़ाना) as well as Urdu (بڑبڑانا) means &#x27;to babble, to speak gibberish, to rave incoherently&#x27;.

In Aramaic, Old Persian and Arabic context, the root refers to &quot;babble confusedly&quot;. It appears as &quot;barbary&quot; or in Old French &quot;barbarie&quot;, itself derived from the Arabic &quot;Barbar&quot;, &quot;Berber&quot;, which is an ancient Arabic term for the North African inhabitants west of Egypt. The Arabic word might be ultimately from Greek &quot;barbaria&quot;.

===English semantics===
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; gives five definitions of the noun &quot;barbarian&quot;, including an obsolete Barbary usage.
* 1. &quot;Etymologically&quot;, A foreigner, one whose language and customs differ from the speaker&#x27;s.
* 2. &quot;Hist&quot;. a. One not a Greek. b. One living outside the pale of the Roman Empire and its civilization, applied especially to the northern nations that overthrew them. c. One outside the pale of Christian civilization. d. With the Italians of the Renaissance: One of a nation outside of Italy.
* 3. A rude, wild, uncivilized person. b. Sometimes distinguished from &quot;savage&quot; (perh. with a glance at 2). c. Applied by the Chinese contemptuously to foreigners.
* 4. An uncultured person, or one who has no sympathy with literary culture.
* †5. A native of Barbary. [See Barbary Coast.] &quot;Obs&quot;. †b. Barbary pirates &amp; A Barbary horse. &quot;Obs&quot;.
The &quot;OED&quot; &quot;barbarous&quot; entry summarizes the semantic history. &quot;The sense-development in ancient times was (with the Greeks) &#x27;foreign, non-Hellenic,&#x27; later &#x27;outlandish, rude, brutal&#x27;; (with the Romans) &#x27;not Latin nor Greek,&#x27; then &#x27;pertaining to those outside the Roman Empire&#x27;; hence &#x27;uncivilized, uncultured,&#x27; and later &#x27;non-Christian,&#x27; whence &#x27;Saracen, heathen&#x27;; and generally &#x27;savage, rude, savagely cruel, inhuman.&#x27;&quot;

==In classical Greco-Roman contexts==
=== Historical developments ===

Greek attitudes towards &quot;barbarians&quot; developed in parallel with the growth of chattel slavery – especially in Athens. Although the enslavement of Greeks for non-payment of debts continued in most Greek states, Athens banned this practice under Solon in the early 6th century BC. Under the Athenian democracy established ca. 508 BC, slavery came into use on a scale never before seen among the Greeks. Massive concentrations of slaves worked under especially brutal conditions in the silver mines at Laureion in south-eastern Attica after the discovery of a major vein of silver-bearing ore there in 483 BC, while the phenomenon of skilled slave craftsmen producing manufactured goods in small factories and workshops became increasingly common.

Furthermore, slave-ownership no longer became the preserve of the rich: all but the poorest of Athenian households came to have slaves in order to supplement the work of their free members. The slaves of Athens that had &quot;barbarian&quot; origins were coming especially from lands around the Black Sea such as Thrace and Taurica (Crimea), while Lydians, Phrygians and Carians came from Asia Minor. Aristotle (&quot;Politics&quot; 1.2–7; 3.14) characterises barbarians as slaves by nature.

From this period, words like &quot;barbarophonos&quot;, cited above from Homer, came into use not only for the sound of a foreign language but also for foreigners who spoke Greek improperly. In the Greek language, the word &quot;logos&quot; expressed both the notions of &quot;language&quot; and &quot;reason&quot;, so Greek-speakers readily conflated speaking poorly with stupidity.

Further changes occurred in the connotations of &quot;barbari&quot;/&quot;barbaroi&quot; in Late Antiquity, when bishops and &quot;catholikoi&quot; were appointed to sees connected to cities among the &quot;civilized&quot; &quot;gentes barbaricae&quot; such as in Armenia or Persia, whereas bishops were appointed to supervise entire peoples among the less settled.

Eventually the term found a hidden meaning through the folk etymology of Cassiodorus (c. 485 – c. 585). He stated that the word &quot;barbarian&quot; was &quot;made up of &quot;barba&quot; (beard) and &quot;rus&quot; (flat land); for barbarians did not live in cities, making their abodes in the fields like wild animals&quot;.

===Hellenic stereotypes===

From classical origins the Hellenic stereotype of barbarism evolved: barbarians are like children, unable to speak or reason properly, cowardly, effeminate, luxurious, cruel, unable to control their appetites and desires, politically unable to govern themselves. Writers voiced these stereotypes with much shrillness – Isocrates in the 4th century B.C., for example, called for a war of conquest against Persia as a panacea for Greek problems.

However, the disparaging Hellenic stereotype of barbarians did not totally dominate Hellenic attitudes. Xenophon (died 354 B.C.), for example, wrote the &quot;Cyropaedia&quot;, a laudatory fictionalised account of Cyrus the Great, the founder of the Persian Empire, effectively a utopian text. In his &quot;Anabasis&quot;, Xenophon&#x27;s accounts of the Persians and other non-Greeks whom he knew or encountered show few traces of the stereotypes.

In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Protagoras&quot;, Prodicus of Ceos calls &quot;barbarian&quot; the Aeolian dialect that Pittacus of Mytilene spoke.

Aristotle makes the difference between Greeks and barbarians one of the central themes of his book on &quot;Politics&quot;, and quotes Euripides approvingly, &quot;Tis meet that Greeks should rule barbarians&quot;.

The renowned orator Demosthenes (384–322 B.C.) made derogatory comments in his speeches, using the word &quot;barbarian&quot;.

In the Bible&#x27;s New Testament, St. Paul (from Tarsus) – lived about A.D. 5 to about A.D. 67) uses the word &quot;barbarian&quot; in its Hellenic sense to refer to non-Greeks (&quot;Romans 1:14&quot;), and he also uses it to characterise one who merely speaks a different language (&quot;1 Corinthians 14:11&quot;). In the Acts of the Apostles, the people of Malta, who were kind to Paul and his companions who had been shipwrecked off their coast, are called barbarians &quot;(Acts 28:2)&quot;.

About a hundred years after Paul&#x27;s time, Lucian – a native of Samosata, in the former kingdom of Commagene, which had been absorbed by the Roman Empire and made part of the province of Syria – used the term &quot;barbarian&quot; to describe himself. Because he was a noted satirist, this could have indicated self-deprecating irony. It might also have suggested descent from Samosata&#x27;s original Semitic-speaking population – who were likely called &quot;barbarians by later Hellenistic, Greek-speaking settlers&quot;, and might have eventually taken up this appellation themselves.

The term retained its standard usage in the Greek language throughout the Middle Ages; Byzantine Greeks used it widely until the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire, (later named the Byzantine Empire) in the 15th century (1453 with the fall of capital city Constantinople).

Cicero (106–43 BC) described the mountain area of inner Sardinia as &quot;a land of barbarians&quot;, with these inhabitants also known by the manifestly pejorative term &quot;latrones mastrucati&quot; (&quot;thieves with a rough garment in wool&quot;). The region, still known as &quot;Barbagia&quot; (in Sardinian &quot;Barbàgia&quot; or &quot;Barbàza&quot;), preserves this old &quot;barbarian&quot; designation in its name – but it no longer consciously retains &quot;barbarian&quot; associations: the inhabitants of the area themselves use the name naturally and unaffectedly.

===The Dying Galatian statue===

The statue of the &quot;Dying Galatian&quot; provides some insight into the Hellenistic perception of and attitude towards &quot;Barbarians&quot;. Attalus I of Pergamon (ruled 241–197 BC) commissioned (220s BC) a statue to celebrate his victory (ca 232 BC) over the Celtic Galatians in Anatolia (the bronze original is lost, but a Roman marble copy was found in the 17th century). The statue depicts with remarkable realism a dying Celt warrior with a typically Celtic hairstyle and moustache. He sits on his fallen shield while a sword and other objects lie beside him. He appears to be fighting against death, refusing to accept his fate.

The statue serves both as a reminder of the Celts&#x27; defeat, thus demonstrating the might of the people who defeated them, and a memorial to their bravery as worthy adversaries. As H. W. Janson comments, the sculpture conveys the message that &quot;they knew how to die, barbarians that they were&quot;.

=== Utter barbarism, civilization, and the noble savage ===
The Greeks admired Scythians and Galatians as heroic individuals – and even (as in the case of Anacharsis) as philosophers – but they regarded their culture as barbaric. The Romans indiscriminately characterised the various Germanic tribes, the settled Gauls, and the raiding Huns as barbarians, and subsequent classically oriented historical narratives depicted the migrations associated with the end of the Western Roman Empire as the &quot;barbarian invasions&quot;.

The Romans adapted the term in order to refer to anything that was non-Roman. The German cultural historian Silvio Vietta points out that the meaning of the word &quot;barbarous&quot; has undergone a semantic change in modern times, after Michel de Montaigne used it to characterize the activities of the Spaniards in the New World – representatives of the more technologically advanced, higher European culture – as &quot;barbarous,&quot; in a satirical essay published in the year 1580. It was not the supposedly &quot;uncivilized&quot; Indian tribes who were &quot;barbarous&quot;, but the conquering Spaniards. Montaigne argued that Europeans noted the barbarism of other cultures but not the crueler and more brutal actions of their own societies, particularly (in his time) during the so-called religious wars. In Montaigne&#x27;s view, his own people – the Europeans – were the real &quot;barbarians&quot;. In this way, the argument was turned around and applied to the European invaders. With this shift in meaning, a whole literature arose in Europe that characterized the indigenous Indian peoples as innocent, and the militarily superior Europeans as &quot;barbarous&quot; intruders invading a paradisical world.

==East Asia==
=== China ===
The term &quot;Barbarian&quot; in traditional Chinese culture had several aspects. For one thing, Chinese has more than one historical &quot;barbarian&quot; exonym. Several historical Chinese characters for non-Chinese peoples were graphic pejoratives. The character for the Yao people, for instance, was changed from &quot;yao&quot; 猺 &quot;jackal&quot; to &quot;yao&quot; 瑤 &quot;precious jade&quot; in the modern period. The original Hua–Yi distinction between Hua (&quot;Chinese&quot;) and Yi (commonly translated as &quot;barbarian&quot;) was based on culture and power but not on race.

Historically, the Chinese used various words for foreign ethnic groups. They include terms like 夷 &quot;Yi&quot;, which is often translated as &quot;barbarians.&quot; Despite this conventional translation, there are also other ways of translating &quot;Yi&quot; into English. Some of the examples include &quot;foreigners,&quot; &quot;ordinary others,&quot; &quot;wild tribes,&quot; &quot;uncivilized tribes,&quot; and so forth.

==== History and terminology ====
Chinese historical records mention what may now perhaps be termed &quot;barbarian&quot; peoples for over four millennia, although this considerably predates the Greek language origin of the term &quot;barbarian&quot;, at least as is known from the thirty-four centuries of written records in the Greek language. The sinologist Herrlee Glessner Creel said, &quot;Throughout Chinese history &quot;the barbarians&quot; have been a constant motif, sometimes minor, sometimes very major indeed. They figure prominently in the Shang oracle inscriptions, and the dynasty that came to an end only in 1912 was, from the Chinese point of view, barbarian.&quot;

Shang dynasty (1600–1046 BC) oracles and bronze inscriptions first recorded specific Chinese exonyms for foreigners, often in contexts of warfare or tribute. King Wu Ding (r. 1250–1192 BC), for instance, fought with the Guifang 鬼方, Di 氐, and Qiang 羌 &quot;barbarians.&quot;

During the Spring and Autumn period (771–476 BC), the meanings of four exonyms were expanded. &quot;These included Rong, Yi, Man, and Di—all general designations referring to the barbarian tribes.&quot; These &quot;Siyi&quot; 四夷 &quot;Four Barbarians&quot;, most &quot;probably the names of ethnic groups originally,&quot; were the Yi or Dongyi 東夷 &quot;eastern barbarians,&quot; Man or Nanman 南蠻 &quot;southern barbarians,&quot; Rong or Xirong 西戎 &quot;western barbarians,&quot; and Di or Beidi 北狄 &quot;northern barbarians.&quot; The Russian anthropologist Mikhail Kryukov concluded.
 Evidently, the barbarian tribes at first had individual names, but during about the middle of the first millennium B.C., they were classified schematically according to the four cardinal points of the compass. This would, in the final analysis, mean that once again territory had become the primary criterion of the we-group, whereas the consciousness of common origin remained secondary. What continued to be important were the factors of language, the acceptance of certain forms of material culture, the adherence to certain rituals, and, above all, the economy and the way of life. Agriculture was the only appropriate way of life for the Hua-Hsia.
The Chinese classics use compounds of these four generic names in localized &quot;barbarian tribes&quot; exonyms such as &quot;west and north&quot; &quot;Rongdi&quot;, &quot;south and east&quot; &quot;Manyi&quot;, &quot;Nanyibeidi&quot; &quot;barbarian tribes in the south and the north,&quot; and &quot;Manyirongdi&quot; &quot;all kinds of barbarians.&quot; Creel says the Chinese evidently came to use &quot;Rongdi&quot; and &quot;Manyi&quot; &quot;as generalized terms denoting &#x27;non-Chinese,&#x27; &#x27;foreigners,&#x27; &#x27;barbarians&#x27;,&quot; and a statement such as &quot;the Rong and Di are wolves&quot; (&quot;Zuozhuan&quot;, Min 1) is &quot;very much like the assertion that many people in many lands will make today, that &#x27;no foreigner can be trusted&#x27;.&quot;
 The Chinese had at least two reasons for vilifying and depreciating the non-Chinese groups. On the one hand, many of them harassed and pillaged the Chinese, which gave them a genuine grievance. On the other, it is quite clear that the Chinese were increasingly encroaching upon the territory of these peoples, getting the better of them by trickery, and putting many of them under subjection. By vilifying them and depicting them as somewhat less than human, the Chinese could justify their conduct and still any qualms of conscience.

This word &quot;Yi&quot; has both specific references, such as to &quot;Huaiyi&quot; 淮夷 peoples in the Huai River region, and generalized references to &quot;barbarian; foreigner; non-Chinese.&quot; &quot;Lin Yutang&#x27;s Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage&quot; translates &quot;Yi&quot; as &quot;Anc[ient] barbarian tribe on east border, any border or foreign tribe.&quot; The sinologist Edwin G. Pulleyblank says the name &quot;Yi&quot; &quot;furnished the primary Chinese term for &#x27;barbarian&#x27;,&quot; but &quot;Paradoxically the Yi were considered the most civilized of the non-Chinese peoples.

====Idealization====
Some Chinese classics romanticize or idealize barbarians, comparable to the western noble savage construct. For instance, the Confucian &quot;Analects&quot; records:
* The Master said, The [夷狄] barbarians of the East and North have retained their princes. They are not in such a state of decay as we in China.
* The Master said, The Way makes no progress. I shall get upon a raft and float out to sea.
* The Master wanted to settle among the [九夷] Nine Wild Tribes of the East. Someone said, I am afraid you would find it hard to put up with their lack of refinement. The Master said, Were a true gentleman to settle among them there would soon be no trouble about lack of refinement.
The translator Arthur Waley noted that, &quot;A certain idealization of the &#x27;noble savage&#x27; is to be found fairly often in early Chinese literature&quot;, citing the &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; maxim, &quot;When the Emperor no longer functions, learning must be sought among the &#x27;Four Barbarians,&#x27; north, west, east, and south.&quot; Professor Creel said,
From ancient to modern times the Chinese attitude toward people not Chinese in culture—&quot;barbarians&quot;—has commonly been one of contempt, sometimes tinged with fear ... It must be noted that, while the Chinese have disparaged barbarians, they have been singularly hospitable both to individuals and to groups that have adopted Chinese culture. And at times they seem to have had a certain admiration, perhaps unwilling, for the rude force of these peoples or simpler customs.

In a somewhat related example, Mencius believed that Confucian practices were universal and timeless, and thus followed by both Hua and Yi, &quot;Shun was an Eastern barbarian; he was born in Chu Feng, moved to Fu Hsia, and died in Ming T&#x27;iao. King Wen was a Western barbarian; he was born in Ch&#x27;i Chou and died in Pi Ying. Their native places were over a thousand &quot;li&quot; apart, and there were a thousand years between them. Yet when they had their way in the Central Kingdoms, their actions matched like the two halves of a tally. The standards of the two sages, one earlier and one later, were identical.&quot;

The prominent (121 CE) &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; character dictionary, defines &quot;yi&quot; 夷 as &quot;men of the east&quot; 東方之人也. The dictionary also informs that &quot;Yi&quot; is not dissimilar from the &quot;Xia&quot; 夏, which means Chinese. Elsewhere in the &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot;, under the entry of &quot;qiang&quot; 羌, the term &quot;yi&quot; is associated with benevolence and human longevity. &quot;Yi&quot; countries are therefore virtuous places where people live long lives. This is why Confucius wanted to go to &quot;yi&quot; countries when the &quot;dao&quot; could not be realized in the central states.

====Pejorative Chinese characters====
Some Chinese characters used to transcribe non-Chinese peoples were graphically pejorative ethnic slurs, in which the insult derived not from the Chinese word but from the character used to write it. For instance, the Written Chinese transcription of &quot;Yao&quot; &quot;the Yao people&quot;, who primarily live in the mountains of southwest China and Vietnam. When 11th-century Song dynasty authors first transcribed the exonym &quot;Yao&quot;, they insultingly chose &quot;yao&quot; 猺 &quot;jackal&quot; from a lexical selection of over 100 characters pronounced &quot;yao&quot; (e.g., 腰 &quot;waist&quot;, 遙 &quot;distant&quot;, 搖 &quot;shake&quot;). During a series of 20th-century Chinese language reforms, this graphic pejorative (written with the 犭&quot;dog/beast radical&quot;) &quot;jackal; the Yao&quot; was replaced twice; first with the invented character &quot;yao&quot; (亻&quot;human radical&quot;) &quot;the Yao&quot;, then with &quot;yao&quot; (玉 &quot;jade radical&quot;) &quot;precious jade; the Yao.&quot; Chinese orthography (symbols used to write a language) can provide unique opportunities to write ethnic insults logographically that do not exist alphabetically. For the Yao ethnic group, there is a difference between the transcriptions &quot;Yao&quot; 猺 &quot;jackal&quot; and &quot;Yao&quot; 瑤 &quot;jade&quot; but none between the romanizations &quot;Yao&quot; and &quot;Yau&quot;.

====Cultural and racial barbarianism====

According to the archeologist William Meacham, it was only by the time of the late Shang dynasty that one can speak of &quot;Chinese,&quot; &quot;Chinese culture,&quot; or &quot;Chinese civilization.&quot; &quot;There is a sense in which the traditional view of ancient Chinese history is correct (and perhaps it originated ultimately in the first appearance of dynastic civilization): those on the fringes and outside this esoteric event were &quot;barbarians&quot; in that they did not enjoy (or suffer from) the fruit of civilization until they were brought into close contact with it by an imperial expansion of the civilization itself.&quot;
In a similar vein, Creel explained the significance of Confucian &quot;li&quot; &quot;ritual; rites; propriety&quot;.
The fundamental criterion of &quot;Chinese-ness,&quot; anciently and throughout history, has been cultural. The Chinese have had a particular way of life, a particular complex of usages, sometimes characterized as &quot;li&quot;. Groups that conformed to this way of life were, generally speaking, considered Chinese. Those that turned away from it were considered to cease to be Chinese. ... It was the process of acculturation, transforming barbarians into Chinese, that created the great bulk of the Chinese people. The barbarians of Western Chou times were, for the most part, future Chinese, or the ancestors of future Chinese. This is a fact of great importance. ... It is significant, however, that we almost never find any references in the early literature to physical differences between Chinese and barbarians. Insofar as we can tell, the distinction was purely cultural.
Dikötter says,
Thought in ancient China was oriented towards the world, or &quot;tianxia&quot;, &quot;all under heaven.&quot; The world was perceived as one homogenous unity named &quot;great community&quot; (&quot;datong&quot;) The Middle Kingdom [China], dominated by the assumption of its cultural superiority, measured outgroups according to a yardstick by which those who did not follow the &quot;Chinese ways&quot; were considered &quot;barbarians.&quot; A Theory of &quot;using the Chinese ways to transform the barbarian&quot; as strongly advocated. It was believed that the barbarian could be culturally assimilated. In the Age of Great Peace, the barbarians would flow in and be transformed: the world would be one. 

According to the Pakistani academic M. Shahid Alam, &quot;The centrality of culture, rather than race, in the Chinese world view had an important corollary. Nearly always, this translated into a civilizing mission rooted in the premise that &#x27;the barbarians could be culturally assimilated&#x27;&quot;; namely &quot;laihua&quot; 來化 &quot;come and be transformed&quot; or &quot;Hanhua&quot; 漢化 &quot;become Chinese; be sinicized.&quot;

Two millennia before the French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss wrote &quot;The Raw and the Cooked&quot;, the Chinese differentiated &quot;raw&quot; and &quot;cooked&quot; categories of barbarian peoples who lived in China. The &quot;shufan&quot; 熟番 &quot;cooked [food eating] barbarians&quot; are sometimes interpreted as Sinicized, and the &quot;shengfan&quot; 生番 &quot;raw [food eating] barbarians&quot; as not Sinicized.
The &quot;Liji&quot; gives this description.
The people of those five regions – the Middle states, and the [Rong], [Yi] (and other wild tribes around them) – had all their several natures, which they could not be made to alter. The tribes on the east were called [Yi]. They had their hair unbound, and tattooed their bodies. Some of them ate their food without its being cooked with fire. Those on the south were called Man. They tattooed their foreheads, and had their feet turned toward each other. Some of them ate their food without its being cooked with fire. Those on the west were called [Rong]. They had their hair unbound, and wore skins. Some of them did not eat grain-food. Those on the north were called [Di]. They wore skins of animals and birds, and dwelt in caves. Some of them did not eat grain-food.

Dikötter explains the close association between nature and nurture. &quot;The &quot;shengfan&quot;, literally &#x27;raw barbarians&#x27;, were considered savage and resisting. The &quot;shufan&quot;, or &#x27;cooked barbarians&#x27;, were tame and submissive. The consumption of raw food was regarded as an infallible sign of savagery that affected the physiological state of the barbarian.&quot;

Some Warring States period texts record a belief that the respective natures of the Chinese and the barbarian were incompatible. Mencius, for instance, once stated: &quot;I have heard of the Chinese converting barbarians to their ways, but not of their being converted to barbarian ways.&quot; Dikötter says, &quot;The nature of the Chinese was regarded as impermeable to the evil influences of the barbarian; no retrogression was possible. Only the barbarian might eventually change by adopting Chinese ways.&quot;

However, different thinkers and texts convey different opinions on this issue. The prominent Tang Confucian Han Yu, for example, wrote in his essay &quot;Yuan Dao&quot; the following: &quot;When Confucius wrote the &quot;Chunqiu&quot;, he said that if the feudal lords use Yi ritual, then they should be called Yi; If they use Chinese rituals, then they should be called Chinese.&quot; Han Yu went on to lament in the same essay that the Chinese of his time might all become Yi because the Tang court wanted to put Yi laws above the teachings of the former kings. Therefore, Han Yu&#x27;s essay shows the possibility that the Chinese can lose their culture and become the uncivilized outsiders, and that the uncivilized outsiders have the potential to become Chinese.

After the Song dynasty, many of China&#x27;s rulers in the north were of Inner Asia ethnicities, such as the Khitans, Juchens, and Mongols of the Liao, Jin and Yuan dynasties, the latter ended up ruling over the entire China. Hence, the historian John King Fairbank wrote, &quot;the influence on China of the great fact of alien conquest under the Liao-Jin-Yuan dynasties is just beginning to be explored.&quot; During the Qing dynasty, the rulers of China adopted Confucian philosophy and Han Chinese institutions to show that the Manchu rulers had received the Mandate of Heaven to rule China. At the same time, they also tried to retain their own indigenous culture. Due to the Manchus&#x27; adoption of Han Chinese culture, most Han Chinese (though not all) did accept the Manchus as the legitimate rulers of China. Similarly, according to Fudan University historian Yao Dali, even the supposedly &quot;patriotic&quot; hero Wen Tianxiang of the late Song and early Yuan period did not believe the Mongol rule to be illegitimate. In fact, Wen was willing to live under Mongol rule as long as he was not forced to be a Yuan dynasty official, out of his loyalty to the Song dynasty. Yao explains that Wen chose to die in the end because he was forced to become a Yuan official. So, Wen chose death due to his loyalty to his dynasty, not because he viewed the Yuan court as a non-Chinese, illegitimate regime and therefore refused to live under their rule. Yao also says that many Chinese who were living in the Yuan-Ming transition period also shared Wen&#x27;s beliefs of identifying with and putting loyalty towards one&#x27;s dynasty above racial/ethnic differences. Many Han Chinese writers did not celebrate the collapse of the Mongols and the return of the Han Chinese rule in the form of the Ming dynasty government at that time. Many Han Chinese actually chose not to serve in the new Ming court at all due to their loyalty to the Yuan. Some Han Chinese also committed suicide on behalf of the Mongols as a proof of their loyalty. The founder of the Ming dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang, also indicated that he was happy to be born in the Yuan period and that the Yuan did legitimately receive the Mandate of Heaven to rule over China. On a side note, one of his key advisors, Liu Ji, generally supported the idea that while the Chinese and the non-Chinese are different, they are actually equal. Liu was therefore arguing against the idea that the Chinese were and are superior to the &quot;Yi.&quot;

These things show that many times, pre-modern Chinese did view culture (and sometimes politics) rather than race and ethnicity as the dividing line between the Chinese and the non-Chinese. In many cases, the non-Chinese could and did become the Chinese and vice versa, especially when there was a change in culture.

====Modern reinterpretations====
According to historian Frank Dikötter, &quot;The delusive myth of a Chinese antiquity that abandoned racial standards in favour of a concept of cultural universalism in which all barbarians could ultimately participate has understandably attracted some modern scholars. Living in an unequal and often hostile world, it is tempting to project the utopian image of a racially harmonious world into a distant and obscure past.&quot;

The politician, historian, and diplomat K. C. Wu analyzes the origin of the characters for the &quot;Yi&quot;, &quot;Man&quot;, &quot;Rong&quot;, &quot;Di&quot;, and &quot;Xia&quot; peoples and concludes that the &quot;ancients formed these characters with only one purpose in mind—to describe the different ways of living each of these people pursued.&quot; Despite the well-known examples of pejorative exonymic characters (such as the &quot;dog radical&quot; in Di), he claims there is no hidden racial bias in the meanings of the characters used to describe these different peoples, but rather the differences were &quot;in occupation or in custom, not in race or origin.&quot; K. C. Wu says the modern character designating the historical &quot;Yi peoples&quot;, composed of the characters for 大 &quot;big (person)&quot; and 弓 &quot;bow&quot;, implies a big person carrying a bow, someone to perhaps be feared or respected, but not to be despised. However, differing from K. C. Wu, the scholar Wu Qichang believes that the earliest oracle bone script for &quot;yi&quot; 夷 was used interchangeably with &quot;shi&quot; &quot;corpse&quot;. The historian John Hill explains that &quot;Yi&quot; &quot;was used rather loosely for non-Chinese populations of the east. It carried the connotation of people ignorant of Chinese culture and, therefore, &#x27;barbarians&#x27;.&quot;

Christopher I. Beckwith makes the extraordinary claim that the name &quot;barbarian&quot; should only be used for Greek historical contexts, and is inapplicable for all other &quot;peoples to whom it has been applied either historically or in modern times.&quot; Beckwith notes that most specialists in East Asian history, including him, have translated Chinese exonyms as English &quot;&quot;barbarian&quot;.&quot; He believes that after academics read his published explanation of the problems, except for direct quotations of &quot;earlier scholars who use the word, it should no longer be used as a term by any writer.&quot;

The first problem is that, &quot;it is impossible to translate the word &quot;barbarian&quot; into Chinese because the concept does not exist in Chinese,&quot; meaning a single &quot;completely generic&quot; loanword from Greek &quot;barbar-&quot;. &quot;Until the Chinese borrow the word &quot;barbarian&quot; or one of its relatives, or make up a new word that explicitly includes the same basic ideas, they cannot express the idea of the &#x27;barbarian&#x27; in Chinese.&quot;. The usual Standard Chinese translation of English &quot;barbarian&quot; is &quot;yemanren&quot; (), which Beckwith claims, &quot;actually means &#x27;wild man, savage&#x27;. That is very definitely not the same thing as &#x27;barbarian&#x27;.&quot; Despite this semantic hypothesis, Chinese-English dictionaries regularly translate &quot;yemanren&quot; as &quot;barbarian&quot; or &quot;barbarians.&quot; Beckwith concedes that the early Chinese &quot;apparently disliked foreigners in general and looked down on them as having an inferior culture,&quot; and pejoratively wrote some exonyms. However, he purports, &quot;The fact that the Chinese did not &quot;like&quot; foreigner Y and occasionally picked a transcriptional character with negative meaning (in Chinese) to write the sound of his ethnonym, is irrelevant.&quot;

Beckwith&#x27;s second problem is with linguists and lexicographers of Chinese. &quot;If one looks up in a Chinese-English dictionary the two dozen or so partly generic words used for various foreign peoples throughout Chinese history, one will find most of them defined in English as, in effect, &#x27;a kind of barbarian&#x27;. Even the works of well-known lexicographers such as Karlgren do this.&quot;
Although Beckwith does not cite any examples, the Swedish sinologist Bernhard Karlgren edited two dictionaries: &quot;Analytic Dictionary of Chinese and Sino-Japanese&quot; (1923) and &quot;Grammata Serica Recensa&quot; (1957). Compare Karlgrlen&#x27;s translations of the &quot;siyi&quot; &quot;four barbarians&quot;:
* &quot;yi&quot; 夷 &quot;barbarian, foreigner; destroy, raze to the ground,&quot; &quot;barbarian (esp. tribes to the East of ancient China)&quot;
* &quot;man&quot; 蛮 &quot;barbarians of the South; barbarian, savage,&quot; &quot;Southern barbarian&quot;
* &quot;rong&quot; 戎 &quot;weapons, armour; war, warrior; N. pr. of western tribes,&quot; &quot;weapon; attack; war chariot; loan for tribes of the West&quot;
* &quot;di&quot; 狄 &quot;Northern Barbarians – &quot;fire-dogs&quot;,&quot; &quot;name of a Northern tribe; low servant&quot;
The &quot;Sino-Tibetan Etymological Dictionary and Thesaurus&quot; Project includes Karlgren&#x27;s &quot;GSR&quot; definitions. Searching the STEDT Database finds various &quot;a kind of&quot; definitions for plant and animal names (e.g., &quot;you&quot; 狖 &quot;a kind of monkey,&quot; but not one &quot;a kind of barbarian&quot; definition. Besides faulting Chinese for lacking a general &quot;barbarian&quot; term, Beckwith also faults English, which &quot;has no words for the many foreign peoples referred to by one or another Classical Chinese word, such as 胡 &quot;hú&quot;, 夷 &quot;yí&quot;, 蠻 &quot;mán&quot;, and so on.&quot;

The third problem involves Tang dynasty usages of &quot;fan&quot; &quot;foreigner&quot; and &quot;lu&quot; &quot;prisoner&quot;, neither of which meant &quot;barbarian.&quot; Beckwith says Tang texts used &quot;fan&quot; 番 or 蕃 &quot;foreigner&quot; (see &quot;shengfan&quot; and &quot;shufan&quot; above) as &quot;perhaps the only true generic at any time in Chinese literature, was practically the opposite of the word &quot;barbarian&quot;. It meant simply &#x27;foreign, foreigner&#x27; without any pejorative meaning.&quot; In modern usage, &quot;fan&quot; 番 means &quot;foreigner; barbarian; aborigine&quot;. The linguist Robert Ramsey illustrates the pejorative connotations of &quot;fan&quot;.
The word &quot;Fān&quot; was formerly used by the Chinese almost innocently in the sense of &#x27;aborigines&#x27; to refer to ethnic groups in South China, and Mao Zedong himself once used it in 1938 in a speech advocating equal rights for the various minority peoples. But that term has now been so systematically purged from the language that it is not to be found (at least in that meaning) even in large dictionaries, and all references to Mao&#x27;s 1938 speech have excised the offending word and replaced it with a more elaborate locution, &quot;Yao, Yi, and Yu.&quot;
Tang dynasty Chinese also had a derogatory term for foreigners, &quot;lu&quot; () &quot;prisoner, slave, captive&quot;. Beckwith says it means something like &quot;those miscreants who should be locked up,&quot; therefore, &quot;The word does not even mean &#x27;foreigner&#x27; at all, let alone &#x27;barbarian&#x27;.&quot;

Christopher I. Beckwith&#x27;s 2009 &quot;The Barbarians&quot; epilogue provides many references, but overlooks H. G. Creel&#x27;s 1970 &quot;The Barbarians&quot; chapter. Creel descriptively wrote, &quot;Who, in fact, were the barbarians? The Chinese have no single term for them. But they were all the non-Chinese, just as for the Greeks the barbarians were all the non-Greeks.&quot; Beckwith prescriptively wrote, &quot;The Chinese, however, have still not yet borrowed Greek &quot;barbar&quot;-. There is also no single native Chinese word for &#x27;foreigner&#x27;, no matter how pejorative,&quot; which meets his strict definition of &quot;barbarian.&quot;.

====Barbarian puppet drinking game====
In the Tang dynasty houses of pleasure, where drinking games were common, small puppets in the aspect of Westerners, in a ridiculous state of drunkenness, were used in one popular permutation of the drinking game; so, in the form of blue-eyed, pointy nosed, and peak-capped barbarians, these puppets were manipulated in such a way as to occasionally fall down: then, whichever guest to whom the puppet pointed after falling was then obliged by honor to empty his cup of Chinese wine.

===Japan===
When Europeans came to Japan, they were called , literally &quot;Barbarians from the South&quot;, because the Portuguese ships appeared to sail from the South. The Dutch, who arrived later, were also called either &quot;nanban&quot; or , literally meaning &quot;Red Hair.&quot;

==Middle East and North Africa==

The native &quot;Berbers&quot; of North Africa were among the many peoples called &quot;Barbarian&quot; by the early Romans. The term continued to be used by medieval Arabs (see Berber etymology) before being replaced by &quot;Amazigh&quot;. In English, the term &quot;Berber&quot; continues to be used as an exonym. The geographical term Barbary or Barbary Coast, and the name of the Barbary pirates based on that coast (and who were not necessarily Berbers) were also derived from it.

The term has also been used to refer to people from Barbary, a region encompassing most of North Africa. The name of the region, &quot;Barbary,&quot; comes from the Arabic word &quot;Barbar,&quot; possibly from the Latin word &quot;barbaricum,&quot; meaning &quot;land of the barbarians&quot;.

Many languages define the &quot;Other&quot; as those who do not speak one&#x27;s language; Greek &quot;barbaroi&quot; was paralleled by Arabic &quot;ajam&quot; &quot;non-Arabic speakers; non-Arabs; (especially) Persians.&quot;

==India==

In the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata, the Sanskrit onomatopoeic word &quot;barbara-&quot; referred to the incomprehensible, unfamiliar speech (perceived as &quot;babbling&quot;, &quot;incoherent stammering&quot;) of non-Vedic peoples (&quot;wretch, foreigner, sinful people, low and barbarous&quot;.)

==Pre-Columbian Americas==
In Mesoamerica the Aztec civilization used the word &quot;Chichimeca&quot; to denominate a group of nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes that lived on the outskirts of the Triple Alliance&#x27;s Empire, in the north of Modern Mexico, and whom the Aztec people saw as primitive and uncivilized. One of the meanings attributed to the word &quot;Chichimeca&quot; is &quot;dog people&quot;.

The Incas of South America used the term &quot;purum awqa&quot; for all peoples living outside the rule of their empire (see Promaucaes).

European and American colonists frequently referred to Native Americans as &quot;savages&quot;.

==Barbarian mercenaries==
The entry of &quot;barbarians&quot; into mercenary service in a metropole repeatedly occurred in history as a standard way in which peripheral peoples from and beyond frontier regions interact with imperial powers as part of a (semi-)foreign militarised proletariat.
Examples include:
* nomadic frontier tribes serving in pre-modern China
* mainly Germanic soldiery in the armies of the declining Roman Empire
* Viking Varangian guards in imperial Byzantium
* Turkic mercenaries in the Abbasid Caliphate
* Widespread use of ethnic mercenary forces in pre-historic Mesoamerica
* Cossack units in the armies of (for example) Poland-Lithuania and of pre-Soviet Russia
* Gurkhas in the colonial and postcolonial Indian military

==Early Modern period==

Italians in the Renaissance often called anyone who lived outside of their country a barbarian. As an example, there is the last chapter of The Prince by Niccolò Machiavelli, &quot;Exhortatio ad Capesendam Italiam in Libertatemque a Barbaris Vinsicandam&quot; (in English: Exhortation to take Italy and free her from the barbarians) in which he appeals to Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, Duke of Urbino to unite Italy and stop the &quot;barbarian invasions&quot; led by other European rulers, such as Charles VIII and Louis XII, both of France, and Ferdinand II of Aragon.

Spanish sea captain Francisco de Cuellar, who sailed with the Spanish Armada in 1588, used the term &#x27;savage&#x27; (&#x27;salvaje&#x27;) to describe the Irish people.

== Twentieth-century barbarianism ==

The romantic reaction against reason and civilisation preceded some attempts to rehabilitate barbarianism in the 20th century. The German Empire glorified the Germans&#x27; Teutonic barbarian past. Kaiser Wilhelm II offered the Huns as an example to his troops, Russian symbolist poets such as Blok invoked an Asiatic nomad heritage of the Scyths and the Mongols, and Nazi Germany cultivated a pre-civilised nationalism to justify/promote enslaving and murdering Jews and Slavs. The Goth sub-culture continued the tradition, echoing the name and reputation of the barbarian outsider early-medieval Goths.

===Marxist use of term===
In her 1916 anti-war pamphlet &quot;The Crisis of German Social Democracy&quot;, the Marxist theorist Rosa Luxemburg writes:
Bourgeois society stands at the crossroads, either transition to Socialism or regression into Barbarism.
Luxemburg attributed her statement to Friedrich Engels, but as was shown by Michael Löwy, Engels had used not the term &quot;Barbarism&quot; but a less resounding formulation: &quot;If the whole of modern society is not to perish, a revolution in the mode of production and distribution must take place.&quot; The case has been made that Luxemburg had remembered a passage from the &quot;Erfurt Program&quot;, written in 1892 by Karl Kautsky, and mistakenly attributed it to Engels:As things stand today capitalist civilization cannot continue; we must either move forward into socialism or fall back into barbarism.
Luxemburg went on to explain what she meant by &quot;regression into Barbarism&quot;: 
A look around us at this moment [i.e., 1916 Europe] shows what the regression of bourgeois society into Barbarism means. This World War is a regression into Barbarism. The triumph of Imperialism leads to the annihilation of civilization. At first, this happens sporadically for the duration of a modern war, but then when the period of unlimited wars begins it progresses toward its inevitable consequences. Today, we face the choice exactly as Friedrich Engels foresaw it a generation ago: either the triumph of Imperialism and the collapse of all civilization as in ancient Rome, depopulation, desolation, degenerationa great cemetery. Or the victory of Socialism, that means the conscious active struggle of the International Proletariat against Imperialism and its method of war.

==Modern popular culture==
Modern popular culture contains such fantasy barbarians as Conan the Barbarian. In such fantasy, the negative connotations traditionally associated with &quot;Barbarian&quot; are often inverted. For example, &quot;The Phoenix on the Sword&quot; (1932), the first of Robert E. Howard&#x27;s &quot;Conan&quot; series, is set soon after the &quot;Barbarian&quot; protagonist had forcibly seized the turbulent kingdom of Aquilonia from King Numedides, whom he strangled upon his throne. The story is clearly slanted to imply that the kingdom greatly benefited from power passing from a decadent and tyrannical hereditary monarch to a strong and vigorous Barbarian usurper.

<text>Frederick I (; 6 November 1754 – 30 October 1816) was the ruler of Württemberg from 1797 to his death. He was the last Duke of Württemberg from 1797 to 1803, then the first and only Elector of Württemberg from 1803 to 1806, before raising Württemberg to a kingdom in 1806 with the approval of Napoleon I.

==Early life==

===In Prussia===
Born in Treptow an der Rega, today Trzebiatów, Poland, Frederick was the eldest son of Frederick II Eugene, Duke of Württemberg, and Sophia Dorothea of Brandenburg-Schwedt. Frederick&#x27;s father was the third son of Charles Alexander, Duke of Württemberg, and Frederick was thus the nephew of the long-reigning Duke Charles Eugene (). Since neither Duke Charles Eugene nor his next brother, Louis Eugene (), had any sons, it was expected that Frederick&#x27;s father (also named Frederick) would eventually succeed to the duchy, and would be succeeded in turn by Frederick.

That eventuality was, however, many years in the future, and the birth of a legitimate son to either of his uncles would preempt Frederick&#x27;s hopes conclusively. Further, his uncle the Duke was not disposed to give any member of his family any role in affairs of government. Frederick therefore determined—like his father—on a military career at the court of Frederick the Great. This later drew Frederick and his family into the Prussian king&#x27;s network of marriage alliances—in 1776 his sister Sophie would marry to &quot;Tsesarevich&quot; Paul, future Emperor of Russia and son of Empress Catherine II. These family ties to Russia had immediate consequences for Frederick and far-reaching ones for Württemberg during the reorganisation of Europe in the wake of the 1814 Congress of Vienna.

In June 1774 he entered the Prussian Army as an oberst in the Kürassierregiment Lölhöffel, rising to a commander in the same unit in December 1776. He fought with it in the War of the Bavarian Succession. In 1780 he took over the 2nd Dragoon Regiment (Krockow). 

Frederick married Duchess Augusta of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (sixteen years old and thus ten years his junior) on 15 October 1780 at Braunschweig. She was the eldest daughter of Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg and Princess Augusta of Great Britain, and thus a niece of George III of Great Britain and sister to Caroline of Brunswick, the future wife of George IV. The marriage was not a happy one—even during her first pregnancy in 1781 she wished to separate but was persuaded to stay with Frederick by her father. Though they had four children, Frederick was rumoured to be bisexual, with a of young noblemen.

He had a good relationship with the King of Prussia and regularly took part in cabinet meetings, though this was clouded by his sister Elizabeth&#x27;s 1788 marriage to Francis of Austria, later the last Holy Roman Emperor and the first Emperor of Austria. Frederick the Great feared that Prussia would become isolated by a closer relationship between Russia and Austria, whose heirs were both married to Frederick of Württemberg&#x27;s sisters and (probably wrongly) blamed him for Francis&#x27;s marriage.

===In Russia===
In 1781 Frederick resigned from the Prussian Army as a major general and the following year he accompanied his sister Sophie and her husband Paul to Russia, after a Grand Tour of Europe that the imperial couple had undertaken in France and Italy. Pleased with the well-spoken and confident young man, Catherine II appointed Frederick Governor of Eastern Finland, with his seat at Viipuri. From June to October 1783 he was also in command of a 15,000- to 20,000-strong corps in Kherson during the Russo-Turkish War, but he was not significantly involved in combat.

Frederick&#x27;s relationship with his wife became more and more strained. He was reportedly violent towards her and after a play during a visit to Saint Petersburg in December 1786, Augusta asked for protection from Empress Catherine. She gave Augusta asylum and ordered Frederick to leave Russia. When Sophie protested at the treatment of her brother, Catherine replied, &quot;It is not I who cover the Prince of Württemberg with opprobrium: on the contrary, it is I who try to bury abominations and it is my duty to suppress any further ones.&quot; Catherine&#x27;s relationship with Frederick&#x27;s brother-in-law, her own son Paul, had also broken down and so Frederick had to help protect his sister Sophie as she came under fire from Catherine. Augusta was sent to live at Lohde Castle in Western Estonia but died on 27 September 1788 from complications of amenorrhea, which she had been suffering from for several years, and although rumours were spread about a death from miscarriage they were disproven through an exhumation later. In the same year, Frederick sold his residence in Vyborg, known as Monrepos.
In the meantime, Frederick&#x27;s succession to the throne of Württemberg had become more and more likely. In June 1789 he traveled to Paris to see the first stages of the French Revolution at first hand, before moving to Ludwigsburg the following year, much to the displeasure of his uncle Carl Eugen, who was still on the throne. His father came to the throne in 1795 and finally Frederick gained his long-wished political influences. His Brunswick-born father helped him make contact with the British royal family—Frederick&#x27;s first wife had been a niece of George III. On 18 May 1797, Frederick married George&#x27;s eldest daughter Charlotte at the Chapel Royal in St James&#x27;s Palace.

==Reign==

===Duke and Elector===
On 23 December 1797, Frederick&#x27;s father, who had succeeded his brother as Duke of Württemberg two years before, died, and Frederick became Duke of Württemberg as Frederick III. He was not to enjoy his reign undisturbed for long, however. In 1800, the French army occupied Württemberg and the Duke and Duchess fled to Vienna. In 1801, Duke Frederick ceded the enclave of Montbéliard to the French Republic, and received Ellwangen in exchange two years later.

In the &quot;Reichsdeputationshauptschluss&quot;, which reorganized the Empire as a result of the French annexation of the west bank of the Rhine, the Duke of Württemberg was raised to the dignity of Prince-elector. Frederick assumed the title &quot;Prince-Elector&quot; () on 25 February 1803, and was thereafter known as the &quot;Elector of Württemberg&quot;. The reorganization of the Empire also secured the new Elector control of various ecclesiastical territories and former free cities, thus greatly increasing the size of his domains.

===King===
In exchange for providing France with a large auxiliary force, Napoleon allowed Frederick to raise Württemberg to a kingdom on 26 December 1805. Fredrick was formally crowned king at Stuttgart on 1 January 1806, and took the regnal name of &quot;King Frederick I&quot;. Soon after, Württemberg seceded from the Holy Roman Empire and joined Napoleon&#x27;s Confederation of the Rhine. Once again, the assumption of a new title also meant territorial expansion, as the territories of various nearby princes were mediatized and annexed by Württemberg. As a symbol of his alliance with Napoleon, Frederick&#x27;s daughter, Princess Catharina, was married to Napoleon&#x27;s youngest brother, Jérôme Bonaparte.

The newly elevated king&#x27;s alliance with France technically made him the enemy of his father-in-law, George III. However, the king&#x27;s dynastic connections would enable him to act as a go-between with Britain and various continental powers. In 1810, Frederick banished the composer Carl Maria von Weber from Württemberg on the pretext that Weber had mismanaged the funds of Frederick&#x27;s brother, Louis, for whom Weber had served as secretary since 1807.

During the German campaign of 1813, Frederick changed sides and went over to the Allies, where his status as the brother-in-law of the British Prince Regent (later George IV) and uncle to the Russian emperor Alexander I helped his standing. After the fall of Napoleon, he attended the Congress of Vienna and was confirmed as king. At Vienna, Frederick and his ministers were very concerned to make sure that Württemberg would be able to retain all the territories it had gained in the past fifteen years. Frederick&#x27;s harsh treatment of the mediatized princes within his domain made him one of the principal targets of the organization of dispossessed princes, which hoped to gain the support of the Powers in regaining their lost sovereignty. In the end, however, Austria, which was seen as the natural ally of the princes, was more interested in alliance with the medium-sized German states like Württemberg than in asserting its traditional role as protector of the smaller sovereigns of the old Empire; and Frederick was allowed to retain his dubiously acquired lands. Frederick, along with the other German princes, joined the new German Confederation in 1815. He died in Stuttgart in October of the next year.

When he became king, he granted his children and further male-line descendants the titles &quot;Princes and Princesses of Württemberg&quot; with the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot;, and he styled his siblings as &quot;Royal Highnesses&quot; with the titles &quot;Dukes and Duchesses of Württemberg&quot;.

He was very tall and obese: behind his back he was known as &quot;The Great Belly-Gerent&quot;. Napoleon remarked that God had created the Prince to demonstrate the utmost extent to which the human skin could be stretched without bursting. In return, Frederick wondered how so much poison could fit in such a small head as Napoleon&#x27;s.

==Marriages and issue==
He married twice:
*Firstly on 15 October 1780, to Augusta of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, by whom he had four children:
**King William I of Württemberg (1781–1864), who succeeded his father as king.
**Princess Catharina of Württemberg (1783–1835), who on 22 August 1807 married Jérôme Bonaparte, King of Westphalia, youngest brother of Emperor Napoleon I of France, and had issue.
**Duchess Sophia Dorothea of Württemberg (1783–1784), died in infancy.
**Prince Paul of Württemberg (1785–1852), whose grandson was King William II of Württemberg.
*Secondly on 18 May 1797 he married Charlotte, Princess Royal, the eldest daughter of King George III of Great Britain, by whom he had only one child, a stillborn daughter delivered on 27 April 1798.

== Honors ==

<doc id="113149" wikidata="Q181479" url="?curid=113149" title="Ben Gurion Airport">
<text>Ben Gurion International Airport , commonly known by the Hebrew-language acronym  (), is the main international airport of Israel. Situated on outskirts north of the city of Lod and directly south of the city of Or Yehuda, it is the busiest airport in the country. It is located to the northwest of Jerusalem and to the southeast of Tel Aviv. It was known as Lod Airport until 1973, when it was renamed in honour of David Ben-Gurion (1886–1973), the first prime minister of Israel. The airport serves as a hub for El Al, Israir, Arkia, and Sundor, and is managed by the Israel Airports Authority.

In 2023, Ben Gurion Airport handled 21.1 million passengers, making it one of the busiest airports in the Middle East. It is considered to be among the five best airports in the Middle East due to its passenger experience and its high level of security; while it has been the target of several terrorist attacks, no attempt to hijack a plane departing from Ben Gurion Airport has ever succeeded.

The airport is of great importance to Israel as it is one of the few convenient entry points into the country for most travellers. As it was Israel&#x27;s only international airport, it was regarded as a single point of failure, which led to the opening of Ramon Airport in 2019.

==History==
===British Mandatory period (1934–1948)===
The airport began during the British Mandate for Palestine as an airstrip of two unpaved runways on the outskirts of the town of Lydda (now Lod), near the Templer colony of Wilhelma. It was built in 1934, largely at the urging of Airwork Services. The first passenger service at the new airport was the Misr Airwork route Cairo—Lydda—Nicosia, inaugurated on 3 August 1935. Subsequently, Misr flew via Lydda to Haifa and Baghdad. The first continental European airline with a regular service to Lydda was LOT Polish Airlines since 4 April 1937. By that time, Lydda Airport boasted four fully operational concrete runways. Holland&#x27;s KLM, which had since 1933 stopped at Gaza en route to Batavia, Dutch East Indies (now Jakarta, Indonesia), moved the service to Lydda in 1937. Imperial Airways, too, used Lydda as a refueling stop en route to India.

During World War II, Imperial Airways and later British Overseas Airways Corporation continued the service to Lydda until the fall of France in June 1940. When the Japanese military advanced into Burma and Malaya in February 1942, KLM curtailed its route to Batavia and made Lydda the eastern terminus of the route. Misr Airwork, which had suspended flights upon the British declaration of war, resumed the weekly Cairo—Lydda—Nicosia service in May 1940.

In 1943, the airport was renamed &quot;RAF Station Lydda&quot; and continued to serve as a major airfield for military air transport and aircraft ferry operations between military bases in Europe, Africa, the Middle East (mainly Iraq and Persia) and South/Southeast Asia. In 1944, as the German threat in the Middle East subsided, Aviron Aviation Company initiated service four times a week between Lydda and Haifa.

The first civilian transatlantic route, New York City to Lydda Airport, was inaugurated by TWA in 1946. The British gave up the airport at the end of April 1948.

===Israel&#x27;s first decades (1948–1973)===

Soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces captured the airport on 10 July 1948, in Operation Danny, transferring control to the newly declared State of Israel. In 1948 the Israelis changed the official name of the airport from &quot;Lod International Airport&quot; to &quot;Tel Aviv-Lod International Airport&quot;. Flights resumed on 24 November 1948. That year, 40,000 passengers passed through the terminal. By 1952, the number had risen to 100,000 a month. Within a decade, air traffic increased to the point where local flights had to be redirected to Tel Aviv&#x27;s other airport, the Sde Dov airfield (SDV) on the city&#x27;s northern coast. By the mid-1960s, 14 international airlines were landing at the airport.

The airport&#x27;s name was changed from Lod to Ben Gurion International Airport in 1973 to honour Israel&#x27;s first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, who died that year.

====Terrorist incidents (1972)====
While Ben Gurion Airport has been a target of Palestinian attacks, the adoption of strict security precautions has ensured that no aircraft departing from Ben Gurion airport has ever been hijacked. On the other hand, airliners hijacked from other countries have landed at Ben Gurion, contributing to two major incidents in the airport&#x27;s history.

In the first incident, on 8 May 1972, four Palestinian Black September terrorists hijacked a Sabena flight en route from Vienna and forced it to land at Ben Gurion airport. Sayeret Matkal commandos, including Benjamin Netanyahu, led by Ehud Barak (both future Israeli Prime Ministers) stormed the plane, killing two of the hijackers and capturing the other two. One passenger was killed.

Later that month, on 30 May 1972, in an attack known as the Lod Airport massacre, 24 people were killed and 80 injured when three members of the Japanese Red Army sprayed machine gun fire into the passenger arrival area. The victims included Aharon Katzir, a prominent protein biophysicist and brother of Israel&#x27;s 4th president. Those injured included a group of twenty Puerto Rican tourists who had just arrived in Israel. The only terrorist who survived was Kozo Okamoto, who received a life sentence but was released in 1985 as part of a prisoner exchange with the PFLP-GC.

===Since the 1980s===
More buildings and runways were added over the years, but with the onset of mass immigration from Ethiopia and the former Soviet Union in the 1980s and 90s, as well as the global increase of international business travel, the existing facilities became painfully inadequate, prompting the design of a new state-of-the-art terminal that could also accommodate the expected tourism influx for the 2000 millennium celebrations. The decision to go ahead with the project was reached in January 1994, but the new terminal, known as Terminal 3, only opened its doors a decade later, on 2 November 2004.

During the 2014 conflict with Gaza, several airlines banned their flights to the airport for a couple of days. In October 2023, with the outbreak of the Israel–Hamas war, the number of airlines that flew into the airport dropped to just 7. By February 2024, only 45 airlines flew into the airport.

The furthest nonstop flight to have departed the airport was a private Airbus A340-500 owned by billionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson who flew on 2 January 2017 to Honolulu on a route over the Arctic Ocean. The flight was projected to last 17 hours and 40 minutes.

Ramon Airport, an international airport near the southern Israeli city of Eilat, serves as a diversion airport for Ben Gurion Airport.

==Passenger terminals==

===Terminal 1===
====History====
Prior to the opening of Terminal 3, Terminal 1 was the main terminal building at Ben Gurion Airport. At that time, the departures check-in area was located on the ground floor. From there, passengers proceeded upstairs to the main departures hall, which contained passport control, duty-free shops, VIP lounges, one synagogue and boarding gates. At the gates, travelers would be required to descend a flight of stairs to return to the ground floor where waiting shuttle buses transported them to airplanes on the tarmac. The arrivals hall with passport control, luggage carousels, duty-free pick-up and customs was located at the south end of the building. The apron buses transferred passengers and crews to and from the terminal to airplanes which were parked on the tarmac over away. After Terminal 3 opened, Terminal 1 was closed except for domestic flights to the airport in Eilat and government flights such as special immigrant flights from North America and Africa. Chartered flights organised by Nefesh B&#x27;Nefesh carrying immigrants from North America and England use this terminal for their landing ceremonies several times a year.

Although Terminal 1 was closed between 2003 and 2007, the building served as a venue for various events and large-scale exhibitions including the &quot;Bezalel Academy of Arts Centennial Exhibition&quot; which was held there in 2006.
The renovations for the terminal were designed by Yosef Assa with three individual atmospheric themes. Firstly, the public halls have a &quot;Land-of-Israel character&quot; with walls painted in the colors of Israel&#x27;s Judean, Jerusalem and Galilee mountains. The departure hall is given an atmosphere of vacation and leisure, whilst the arrivals hall is given a more urban theme as passengers return to the city.
In February 2006, the Israel Airports Authority announced plans to invest 4.3 million NIS in a new VIP wing for private jet passengers and crews, as well as others interested in avoiding the main terminal. VIP ground services already exist, but a substantial increase in users has justified expanding the facilities, which will also boost airport revenues. The IAA released figures showing significant growth in private jet flights (4,059, a 36.5% increase from 2004) as well as private jet users (14,613, a 46.2% increase from 2004). The new VIP wing, operated by an outside licensee, will be located in an upgraded and expanded section of Terminal 1. All flight procedures (security check, passport control and customs) will be handled here. This wing will include a hall equipped for press conferences, a deluxe lounge, special meeting rooms equipped with state-of-the-art business facilities and a designated lounge for flight crews who spend time at the airport between flights. It was announced in January 2008, however, that the IAA planned to construct a new VIP terminal next to Terminal 3.

====International low-cost and domestic terminal====
Terminal 1 was closed in 2003 and reopened in 2007 as the domestic terminal following extensive renovations, and in July 2008, to cater for summer charter and low-cost flights. It remained open for these charter and low-cost flights for the 2008 summer season then temporarily closed in October 2008, when it underwent further renovation and reopened again in the summer of 2009, when it was expected to reach a three-month capacity of 600,000 passengers on international flights. As of 2010, several low-cost carriers&#x27; international flights were operating out of Terminal 1 year-round including Vueling flights to Barcelona and easyJet flights to London (Luton), Manchester, Geneva, and Basel. In 2015, due to increased demand and following another expansion of the terminal, the Israel Airports Authority made Terminal 1 available to all low-cost carriers under certain conditions. Flights operating out of Terminal 1 are charged lower airport fees than those operating out of Terminal 3.

Until the summer of 2017 Terminal 1 was used for flight check-in, security screening and passport-control for international flights for passengers of certain low-cost airlines, but following passport control passengers were bussed to the departures concourse of Terminal 3 from which they boarded their flights. All incoming flights for airlines operating out of Terminal 1 were handled in Terminal 3. However, beginning on 19 June 2017 and following several months of renovations, Terminal 1 passengers began being bussed directly to their flights from Terminal 1, although incoming passengers continue to be handled in Terminal 3. The renovations to Terminal 1&#x27;s boarding area included adding duty-free shops, restaurants and cafes. The terminal was also equipped with advanced checked-baggage handling and screening systems, similar to those in Terminal 3.

A free public shuttle from Terminal 3 and the railway station to and from Terminal 1 operates approximately every 15 to 30 minutes (depending on the time of day).

===Terminal 3===

Terminal 3, which opened on 28 October 2004, replaced Terminal 1 as the main international gateway to and from Israel. The building was designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM). Moshe Safdie &amp; Associates and TRA (now Black and Veatch) designed a linking structure and the airside departure areas and gates. Ram Karmi and other Israeli architects were the local architects of record. The inaugural flight was an El Al flight to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City.

Work on &quot;Natbag 2000&quot;, as the Terminal 3 project was known, was scheduled for completion prior to 2000 in order to handle a massive influx of pilgrims expected for the Millennium celebrations. This deadline was not met due to higher than anticipated costs and a series of work stoppages in the wake of the bankruptcy of the main Turkish contractor. The project eventually cost an estimated one billion US dollars. Due to the proximity of the airport to the country&#x27;s largest population centres and the problem of noise pollution, another international airport is being considered to be built elsewhere in the country, such as the new Ilan and Assaf Ramon Airport in Southern Israel.

The overall layout of Terminal 3 is similar to that of airports in Europe and North America, with multiple levels and considerable distances to walk after disembarking from the aircraft. The walk is assisted by escalators and moving walkways. The upper level departures hall, with an area of over , is equipped with 110 check-in counters and as well as flight information display systems. A small shopping mall, known as Buy &amp; Bye, is open to both travellers and the general public. The mall, which includes shops, restaurants and a post office, was planned to be a draw for non-flyers too. On the same level as the mall, passengers enter passport control and the security check. Planes taking off and landing can be viewed from a distinctive tilted glass wall. The arrivals hall is located on the ground floor where there are also 20 additional check-in counters (serving Star Alliance airlines). Car rental counters are located in an intermediate level situated between the departing and arriving passenger halls. Terminal 3 has two synagogues.

After the main security check, passengers wait for their flights in the star-shaped duty-free rotunda. A variety of cafes, restaurants and duty-free shops are located there, open 24 hours a day, as well as a synagogue, banking facilities, a transit hall for connecting passengers and a desk for VAT refunds.

Terminal 3 has a total of 40 gates divided among four concourses (B, C, D, and E), each with 8 jet bridge-equipped gates (numbered 2 through 9), as well as two stand gates (bus bays 1 and 1A) from which passengers are ferried to aircraft. Two gates in concourse E utilize dual jet bridges for more efficient processing of very large widebody aircraft. Concourses B, C, and D were opened when terminal 3 opened in 2004, while concourse E was completed in 2018. Space exists for one additional concourse (A) at Terminal 3.

Free wireless internet is provided throughout the terminal.
The terminal has three business lounges—the exclusive El Al King David Lounge for frequent flyers and three &quot;Dan&quot; lounges for either privileged or paying flyers.

In January 2007, the IAA announced plans for a 120-bed hotel to be located about west of Terminal 3. The tender for the hotel was published by the IAA in late 2017.

When the terminal was built, it was said to have a capacity for up to 12 million passengers a year. In 2023, 25 million passengers are expected to pass through Ben Gurion Airport.

===Former and unopened terminals===

====Terminal 2====
Terminal 2 was inaugurated in 1969 when Arkia resumed operations at the airport after the Six-Day War. Terminal 2 served domestic flights until 20 February 2007 when these services moved into the refurbished Terminal 1. Due to increased traffic in the late 1990s and over-capacity reached at Terminal 1, an international section was added until Terminal 3 was opened. After the transfer of domestic services to Terminal 1, Terminal 2 was demolished in order to make room for additional air freight handling areas.

====Terminal 4====
This terminal, built in 1999, was meant to handle the crowds expected in 2000, but never officially opened. To date, it has only been used as a terminal for passengers arriving from Asia during the SARS epidemic.
Another use for the terminal was for the memorial ceremonies upon the arrival of the casket of Col. Ilan Ramon after the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster in February 2003 and the arrival of Elhanan Tannenbaum and the caskets of three Israeli soldiers from Lebanon in January 2004.

==Development plans==
In December 2017, the IAA announced a long-term expansion plan for Ben Gurion Airport estimated to cost approximately NIS 9 billion. Plans include further expansion of Terminal 1, a new dedicated domestic flights terminal, a major expansion of Terminal 3&#x27;s landside terminal which would add approximately 90 additional check-in counters, construction of Concourse A, and additional aircraft parking spaces and ramps. In addition, air cargo facilities would be relocated to a large, currently-unused tract of land in the northern part of the airport&#x27;s property (north of runway 08/26) where additional aircraft maintenance facilities would also be built.

In the meantime, to ease immediate overcrowding problems at Terminal 3&#x27;s landside terminal, in the spring of 2018 a temporary large, air-conditioned tent was erected adjacent to Terminal 3 housing 25 check-in counters and security screening facilities. This tent was used for compulsory COVID-19 testing for all arriving passengers between 2020 and 2022.

In August 2018, the IAA published a tender for the construction and operation of a new terminal, dedicated to handling private and executive aircraft traffic.

In late 2021 construction began on a new interchange that will provide additional access to the airport from Highway 1. The new interchange significantly reduced the distance vehicles must travel to access the airport&#x27;s main terminal from the direction of Tel Aviv and other points north and west of the airport.

==Office buildings==
The Airport City development, a large office park, is located east of the main airport property. It is at the junction of the Jerusalem and Tel Aviv metropolitan areas.

The head office of El Al is located at Ben Gurion Airport, as is the head office of the Israel Airports Authority.

The head offices of the Civil Aviation Authority and Challenge Airlines IL are located in the Airport City office park nearby the airport.

Israel Aerospace Industries maintains its head office on airport grounds as well as extensive aviation construction and repair facilities.

==Runways==

===Main runway===
The closest runway to terminals 1 and 3 is 12/30, in length, and is followed by a taxiway. Most landings take place on this runway from West to East, approaching from the Mediterranean Sea over southern Tel Aviv. During inclement weather, it may also be used for takeoffs (Direction 12). A 17 million NIS renovation project was completed in November 2007 which reinforced the runway and made it suitable for future wide-body aircraft. In September 2008, a new ILS serving the runway was activated. The main runway was closed from 2011 until early 2014 in order to accommodate the extension of runway 03/21 and other construction activity in the vicinity of the runway.

===Short runway===
When it was originally built, the short runway (direction 03/21) was long, making it too short to accommodate most mainline passenger jets. At the time it mainly served cargo aircraft of the Israeli Air Force and as a taxiway for runway 26. However, by late 2011, the runway was closed and most of the activity in the military apron to the east of the runway was permanently relocated to the Nevatim Airbase in southern Israel. In late May 2014 the runway was reopened after having been rebuilt and lengthened to , allowing it to handle most types of aircraft. It is equipped with an ILS and mostly handles landings from north to south.

===Quiet runway===
The longest runway at the airfield, , and the main take off runway from east to west (direction 08/26), is referred to as &quot;the quiet runway&quot; since jets taking off in this direction produce less noise pollution for surrounding residents. A 24 million NIS renovation project completed in February 2006 reinforced the runway and made it suitable for wide-body aircraft such as Airbus A380.

===History and development===
The original layout of the airfield as designed by the British in the 1930s included four intersecting 800 m runways suitable for the piston engined aircraft of the day. However, none of this original layout is visible nowadays since as usage increased and aircraft types and needs changed over the years various runways on the airport&#x27;s premises were built and removed.

The main runway (12/30) is the oldest surviving runway in the airport, with the quiet (08/26) and short (03/21) runways having been built in the late 1960s and 1970s. Since very little commercial traffic could operate on the short runway, for approximately forty years, the airport mostly relied on runways 12/30 and 08/26. This presented a problem, however: the fact that these two runways intersect near their western end creates a crisscross pattern between aircraft landing and taking off. This pattern reduces the number of aircraft which can arrive to and depart from the airport and has detrimental safety implications as well.

With passenger traffic projected to increase, plans were drawn in the 1980s and 90s for the extension of runways 03/21 and 08/26 as a means of alleviating some of Ben Gurion&#x27;s safety and capacity concerns. These plans were approved in 1997 and construction began in 2010. The extension of runway 03/21 allows the airport to operate in an &quot;open V&quot; configuration, allowing for simultaneous landings and take offs on runways 08/26 and 03/21 and thus more than double the number of aircraft movements which can be handled at peak times, while increasing the overall level of air safety in and around the airport. Construction took four years and cost 1 billion NIS (financed from the Israeli Airports Authority budget) and was completed 29 May 2014. It included paving of runways and taxiways, using more than 1.5 million tons of asphalt, laying one million meters of runway lighting cables, of high-voltage power lines and 10,000 light fixtures. The construction of several new taxiways between the existing runways and terminals also significantly reduced taxi times at the airport.

===Israel-Hamas War (2023- )===
Due to the threat of missiles, the runway directions are restricted to avoid flying over the war zone in Gaza. 08/26 is restricted to departing flights, and 03/21 is restricted to arriving flights.

==Security procedures==

===Overview===
Security at Ben Gurion International Airport operates on several levels.

All cars, taxis, buses and trucks go through a preliminary security checkpoint before entering the airport compound. Armed guards spot-check the vehicles by looking into cars, taxis and boarding buses, exchanging a few words with the driver and passengers. Armed security personnel stationed at the terminal entrances keep a close watch on those who enter the buildings. If someone arouses their suspicion or looks nervous, they may strike up a conversation to further assess the person&#x27;s intent. Plainclothes armed personnel patrol the area outside the building, and hidden surveillance cameras operate at all times. Inside the building, both uniformed and plainclothes security officers are on constant patrol. Departing passengers are personally questioned by security agents even before arriving at the check-in desk. This interview can last as little as a minute, or as long as an hour if a passenger is selected for additional screening. Luggage and body searches may be conducted.

Until August 2007, there was a system of color codes on checked baggage but the practice was discontinued after complaints of discrimination. In the past, checked bags were screened following the personal interview and before passengers arrived at the check-in desks. Occasionally, if security assessed a person as a low risk, they were passed straight through to the check-in desks, bypassing the main X-ray machines, a practice which also drew some discrimination complaints. This process ceased in April 2014 when the main X-ray machines were removed from the passenger queuing area in Terminal 3 and baggage screening began being performed after the baggage was checked-in by airline representatives (as is common in most airports around the world). Terminal 1 began using the same procedure in the summer of 2017.

===Baggage screening===
After check-in, all checked baggage are screened using sophisticated X-ray and CT scanners and put in a pressure chamber to trigger any possible explosive devices which have a trigger dependent on air pressure. Following the check-in process, passengers continue to personal security and passport control. Before passing through the metal detectors and putting carry-on baggage through the X-ray machine at the security checkpoint, passports and boarding passes are re-inspected and additional questions may be asked. Before boarding the aircraft, passports and boarding passes are verified once again. Security procedures for incoming flights are not as stringent, but passengers may be questioned by passport control depending on country of origin, or countries visited prior to arrival in Israel. Passengers who have recently visited Arab countries are subject to further questioning.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===
The following airlines serve regular scheduled and charter destinations at Ben Gurion Airport. Most of the airlines have been suspended or have delayed their resumption due to the Israel-Hamas War since October 7, 2023 and the ongoing situation in the Middle East. Some airports have even taken out flights to Tel Aviv from their list of destinations.


===Cargo===
==Statistics==

Commercial flights from Sde Dov Airport which, until its closure in July 2019, handled more domestic passengers annually than TLV have been moved to Ben Gurion.





==Ground transportation==
The airport is located near Highway 1, the main Jerusalem–Tel Aviv Highway and Highway 40. The airport is accessible by car or public bus. Israel Railways operates train service from the airport to several parts of the country and taxi stands are located outside the arrivals building. A popular transportation option is a share taxi van, known in Hebrew as a &quot;monit sherut&quot; (service cab), going to Jerusalem, Haifa, and Beersheba.

===Public transport===
Israel has an integrated nationwide public transport payment system covering multiple transit options (train, bus, and light rail) run by various operators using a single payment card: the Rav-Kav. It features flexible tariff arrangements and offers free transfers between transit methods within certain geographical zones and time periods. A public transport information office which also issues Rav-Kav cards is located in the arrivals hall of Terminal 3. With a few exceptions, most public transport options (except for taxis and service cabs) do not operate on the Sabbath (i.e., from early Friday evenings to late Saturday evenings as well as certain Jewish holidays).

A new app payment system was introduced in December 2020. The apps have a different, simpler fare system. The two apps supporting routing and payment are: RavPass (by HopOn), and Moovit (by Moovit and Pango).

====Rail====

Israel Railways operates the Ben Gurion Airport Railway Station, located in the lower level of Terminal 3. From this station passengers may head northwest to Tel Aviv, Haifa and other destinations in the north, or southeast to Modi&#x27;in and Jerusalem. The journey to Tel Aviv Savidor Central railway station takes about 18 minutes and to Jerusalem&#x27;s Yitzhak Navon station about 25 minutes. There is also late night/early morning train service to and from the airport terminating at Beersheba Center via Lod, Ashkelon, and selected destinations in between. Almost 3.3 million passengers used the railway line to and from the airport in 2009. The service does not operate on Shabbat and Jewish holidays but on all other days it runs day and night. The line to Nahariya through Tel Aviv and Haifa operated 24 hours a day on weekdays, but these services were suspended following the COVID-19 pandemic and put on hold until railway electrification works are completed in the mid-2020s, following which the line would run from Jerusalem and terminate at Karmiel instead of Nahariya (though it would continue to service Tel Aviv and Haifa).

====Bus or taxi====
The airport is served by regular inter-city bus lines, limousine and private shuttle services, Sherut &quot;shared&quot; door to door taxi vans and regular taxis. Afikim bus company provides 24 hours a day, on the hour, direct service to Jerusalem with line 485. the line departs from Terminal 3 on the 2nd floor and passes through Terminal 1. Egged bus number 5 ferries passengers between the terminals and a small bus terminal in the nearby Airport City business park near El Al junction just outside the airport where they can connect to regular Egged bus routes passing through the area. Passengers connecting at Airport City can pay for both rides on the same ticket, not having to pay an extra fare for bus No. 5. Other bus companies directly serve Terminal 3, and the airport also provides a free shuttle bus between terminals. On Shabbat, when there is no train service, a shared shuttle service is available between the airport and Tel Aviv hotels.

===Car===
Located on Highway 1, the Jerusalem – Tel Aviv highway, the airport has a total of approximately 20,000 parking spaces for short and long-term parking. The spaces for long-term parking are situated several kilometres from the terminal, and are reached by a free shuttle bus. Car rental at the airport is available from Avis, Budget, Eldan, Tamir Rental, Thrifty, Hertz, and Shlomo Sixt.

===Passenger rankings===
In December 2006, Ben Gurion International Airport ranked first among 40 European airports and 8th out of 77 airports in the world, in a survey, conducted by Airports Council International, to determine the most customer-friendly airport. Tel Aviv placed second in the grouping of airports which carry between 5 and 15 million passengers per year behind Japan&#x27;s Nagoya Airport. The survey consisted of 34 questions. A random sampling of 350 passengers at the departure gate were asked how satisfied they were with the service, infrastructure and facilities. Ben Gurion received a rating of 3.94 out of 5, followed by Vienna, Munich, Amsterdam, Brussels, Zürich, Copenhagen, and Helsinki. The airport retained its title as the best Middle Eastern airport in the 2007, 2008, and 2009 surveys.

<text>David Mirkin (born ) is an American feature film and television director, writer and producer. Mirkin grew up in Philadelphia and intended to become an electrical engineer, but abandoned this career path in favor of studying film at Loyola Marymount University. After graduating, he became a stand-up comedian, and then moved into television writing. He wrote for the sitcoms &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot; and &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; and served as showrunner on the series &quot;Newhart&quot;. After an unsuccessful attempt to remake the British series &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, Mirkin created &quot;Get a Life&quot; in 1990. The series starred comedian Chris Elliott and ran for two seasons, despite a lack of support from many Fox network executives, who disliked the show&#x27;s dark and surreal humor. He moved on to create the sketch show &quot;The Edge&quot; starring his then-partner, actress Julie Brown.

Mirkin left &quot;The Edge&quot; during its run and became the executive producer and showrunner of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; for its fifth and sixth seasons. Mirkin has been cited as introducing a more surreal element to the show&#x27;s humor, as shown by his first writing credit for the show, &quot;Deep Space Homer&quot;, which sees Homer Simpson go to space as part of a NASA program to restore interest in space exploration. He won four Primetime Emmy Awards and a Peabody Award for his work on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Mirkin stood down as showrunner after season six, but produced several subsequent episodes, co-wrote &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot; (2007) and from 2013 onwards has remained on the show as a consultant. Mirkin has also moved into feature film direction: he directed the films &quot;Romy and Michele&#x27;s High School Reunion&quot; (1997) and &quot;Heartbreakers&quot; (2001).

==Early life==
Mirkin was born and raised in Philadelphia, the son of Saul Mirkin (born Saul Capan) and Jennie Belkin. He graduated from Northeast High School in 1975. He is Jewish. His father was a computer engineer who was working at the Naval Aviation Supply Department at the time of his death from a heart attack in 1960, aged 49. Mirkin&#x27;s older brother, Gary, worked as a television engineer for the Philadelphia NBC affiliate, KYW-TV, now a CBS owned-and-operated station. Throughout his childhood, Mirkin had an interest in film, and explored both writing and filming. Mirkin has described himself as a &quot;nerd&quot; and was often in trouble as a child because he was &quot;in another world&quot;. At high school, he felt the teaching was &quot;too slow&quot; and was allowed by his teachers to &quot;skip class two to three days a week&quot;.

Mirkin intended to pursue a career in electrical engineering, which he saw as a more stable employment opportunity than writing or film making. He took a course at Philadelphia&#x27;s Drexel University which offered six months of teaching followed by a six-month internship at the National Aeronautics Federal Experimental Center. Mirkin found the experience to be monotonous and unenjoyable and chose to abandon this career path. He decided that &quot;making no money doing something I loved was going to be better than making a good living doing something I didn&#x27;t&quot;, so took &quot;an enormous chance on show business&quot; and moved to Los Angeles. He attended film school at Loyola Marymount University, and graduated in 1978.

Mirkin lists Woody Allen and James L. Brooks as his writing inspirations and Stanley Kubrick and the work of the comedy group Monty Python as developing his &quot;dark sense of humor&quot;. He considers Mike Nichols&#x27;s film &quot;The Graduate&quot; to be what inspired him to enter directing.

==Career==

===Early career on &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; and &quot;Newhart&quot;===
Mirkin started out as a stand-up comedian in 1982 and performed across the United States, including at The Comedy Store, where he became a regular, and at The Improv. The first joke he used in his routine was, &quot;Is it just me or has everybody been coughing up blood lately?&quot; Mirkin considers the joke to be &quot;an insight into the way [he writes]&quot;. Stand-up comedy was the most profitable and easily accessible route Mirkin found into the comedy industry, but &quot;it wasn&#x27;t a lifestyle that [he] particularly coveted,&quot; especially due to the traveling required.

He got his first job writing for television on the sitcom &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; in 1983. Through his cousin, Mirkin met writer George Tricker who became his mentor. Tricker wrote for the &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; spin-off &quot;The Ropers&quot; so Mirkin wrote a spec script for an episode of &quot;The Ropers&quot;. Although rejected by the producers of &quot;The Ropers&quot;, &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; creator Bernie West was impressed by the script and Mirkin began pitching ideas for that series instead. Mirkin pitched to the series&#x27; story editors for several years without success because they had very limited script buying power. He was eventually able to pitch to the show&#x27;s producers, who bought a script from him, and then hired him as a staff writer. Mirkin was apprehensive about the job because he was aiming to work on &quot;Cheers&quot;, a show more focused on character-driven humor which Mirkin preferred writing, but felt he could not turn the opportunity down. Mirkin considered &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; to have &quot;a classic French farce structure&quot;, as &quot;the characters were so stupid they could never say anything clever.&quot; This meant Mirkin had to adapt his preference for character-driven comedy to fit the show; it &quot;forced you to put all the cleverness into the plot, a much more difficult thing to do. The plot had to get all the laughs&quot;. Mirkin felt the experience &quot;taught [him] a lot about structure&quot; which greatly aided his later work on character-focused shows.
Still hoping to work on &quot;Cheers&quot;, Mirkin sent a spec script of an episode of &quot;Taxi&quot; to &quot;Cheers&quot; writers Ken Levine and David Isaacs. The two approved and offered Mirkin a freelance job writing one of the final nine episodes of the show&#x27;s first season, pending their commissioning by NBC. The episodes were commissioned, but Mirkin&#x27;s agent rejected the &quot;Cheers&quot; job without telling his client, failing to see why Mirkin would want to work on what was then the lowest-rated comedy on television. Mirkin sacked the agent and signed on with Robb Rothman. Rothman knew Dan Wilcox, the executive producer of &quot;Newhart&quot;, which like &quot;Cheers&quot; was more character-focused. Rothman persuaded Wilcox to hire Mirkin. Mirkin wrote a freelance script and in 1984 beat seven other writers to a staff position on the series. He served as a writer and supervising story editor, before being promoted to executive producer and showrunner after one and a half years. Mirkin &quot;felt [&quot;Newhart&quot;] was where I belonged. I&#x27;d finally come to a place in my life where everything I&#x27;d ever wanted had come together.&quot; In 1987, he received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series for &quot;Newhart&quot;. It was the first nomination the show had received in that category and for the first episode Mirkin wrote as the series&#x27; showrunner. Mirkin directed several of the &quot;Newhart&quot; episodes he wrote because he saw directing as &quot;a means of protecting the writing&quot;. A philosophy he carried into his later work, Mirkin felt that &quot;being the head writer... was not enough; you had to see the material through its execution – especially the weirder stuff. You had to be right there to make sure every sick idea didn&#x27;t lose any disturbing nuance.&quot; Mirkin left &quot;Newhart&quot; in 1988, desiring to work on a single-camera sitcom.

After leaving &quot;Newhart&quot;, Mirkin wrote freelance scripts for &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot; and &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;. Garry Shandling asked Mirkin to co-create &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; with him. Mirkin did not have time, but worked as writer and consultant on the show&#x27;s first season, and later returned to direct the 1998 final season episode &quot;The Beginning of the End&quot;.

===&quot;Get a Life&quot; and &quot;The Edge&quot;===
Mirkin wanted to produce a surreal, &quot;Monty Python&quot;-esque, single-camera comedy series. He had a development deal with &quot;Newhart&quot;″s producers MTM Enterprises and persuaded them to buy the rights to produce a pilot for an American adaptation of the British sitcom &quot;The Young Ones&quot;. The pilot was entitled &quot;Oh No, Not Them!&quot;, and featured Nigel Planer from the original series, as well as Jackie Earle Haley and Robert Bundy. Mirkin had wanted to cast comedian Chris Elliott in the pilot, but was prevented by Fox, which wanted Elliott for another show. &quot;Oh No, Not Them!&quot;, in Mirkin&#x27;s words, &quot;tested through the floor&quot; because it was too &quot;surreal&quot; and &quot;sarcastic&quot; and was not picked up. Mirkin and Elliott decided to develop a show together, along with Adam Resnick. In 1990, they created the sitcom &quot;Get a Life&quot;, which was conceived as a dark, surreal, psychotic version of the cartoon &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;. The show stars Elliott as Chris Peterson, a 30-year-old newspaper delivery boy who still lives with his parents, and who is increasingly losing his grip on reality. Fox was lukewarm about the idea, but Mirkin convinced them to order a pilot by understating how dark the show would be. The network executives disliked the pilot after seeing an initial run-through, but Mirkin felt that this was because they &quot;didn&#x27;t get&quot; the show and opted not to change it. The executives enjoyed the finished pilot and it was aired. However, throughout the show&#x27;s run, the network&#x27;s initially negative attitude prevailed. According to Mirkin, many of the executives struggled to understand it and objected to the darkness and surrealism of the show&#x27;s humor, which included the frequent death of Elliott&#x27;s character, and regularly threatened to shut down production. After its first season, on the insistence of the network, Chris moves out of his parents&#x27; garage, attempts to get additional jobs to his paper route, and attempts to get a girlfriend. However, Mirkin and Elliott refused to &quot;[compromise on] the essential goofiness of the show&quot;.

Mirkin served as executive producer for the series, directed most of the episodes, wrote several of them, and oversaw the filming and production of them all, to ensure that they had the correct &quot;tone&quot;. The show&#x27;s production process was lengthy; Mirkin would rise at to film the show, write further episodes from until , and then repeat that the following day. Unlike most single-camera shows, which have around six days to film, Mirkin had to film each episode in two days. He enjoyed doing it, but described it as &quot;not a healthy way to live&quot;. Due to the logistics of filming the show, especially its many sets and effects, Mirkin convinced Fox to not film it in front of a studio audience and use a laugh track instead. The show achieved steady ratings in its first season, finishing 92nd out of the listed in the Nielsen ratings. However, for its second season, it was moved from on Sunday to on Saturday and lost the bulk of its audience; it was canceled after that second season finished in 1992. In a 1999 piece about the show&#x27;s DVD release, Tom Shales praised the show, concluding, &quot;At its best, &quot;Get a Life&quot; achieved dizzying heights of surrealist farce. At its worst, it was at least amusingly idiotic existential slapstick. &quot;Get a Life&quot; is a television classic unlike any other. For one thing, most of the others are better. We&#x27;re not talking &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; here, after all. But we are talking riotous nonsense, and that&#x27;s not to be sneezed at. It&#x27;s to be laughed at. Hard.&quot; A strong cult following subsequently developed, and Mirkin noted that although the show was canceled &quot;ultimately we got the audience I was hoping for and they are super dedicated and passionate to this day.&quot;

In 1991, Mirkin wrote a pilot with Julie Brown entitled &quot;The Julie Show&quot;, starring Brown, but NBC did not produce it. Several people at the network enjoyed it and commissioned &quot;The Edge&quot;, a sketch comedy show also written by Mirkin and Brown, with Mirkin directing. NBC opted against production, but Fox ran it from 1992 to 1993. Mirkin had long wished to produce a sketch show, and designed &quot;The Edge&quot; to be &quot;fast-paced&quot; and &quot;some skits overlap, end abruptly or are broken into segments&quot;, in order to maintain attention. &quot;The Edge&quot; was a ratings success and was supported by the network. Mirkin considered it &quot;the first time I experienced the feeling of having a hit that I created. It just kept building and growing.&quot; The show&#x27;s material often inflamed its targets, particularly producer Aaron Spelling. Spelling objected to a sketch mocking his series &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, another Fox show, and its lead actress Tori Spelling, who is his daughter. He demanded a public apology and that no further episodes contain the parody, threatening to sue. The show&#x27;s production company TriStar Television refused, while Mirkin responded: &quot;The thing about these parodies is they don&#x27;t hurt a show. It&#x27;s only cross-promotion. The viewers who like the show always come back the next week. What&#x27;s upsetting to me is it shows absolutely that Mr. Spelling has no sense of humor.&quot; Mirkin left his role as executive producer of &quot;The Edge&quot; during its run. The &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; reported that Mirkin had been &quot;forced off the show&quot;, due to the negative reaction of Spelling and others, though in 2012, Mirkin stated that he left the series after refusing to accept a substantially reduced budget. The show&#x27;s producers Sony failed to persuade him to stay but he returned to the series to produce its final &quot;Best Of&quot; compilation.

===&quot;The Simpsons&quot;===
Mirkin was the executive producer and showrunner for the animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, during its fifth and sixth seasons (1993–1995). Following the end of the show&#x27;s fourth season, most of the original staff members left the show; only Bill Oakley, Josh Weinstein, Conan O&#x27;Brien and Dan McGrath remained, and O&#x27;Brien soon left to replace David Letterman as host of &quot;Late Night&quot;. Executive producers James L. Brooks and Richard Sakai hired Mirkin following his exit from &quot;The Edge&quot;. He had been asked to join the show&#x27;s writing team when it started in 1989, but decided instead to work on &quot;Get a Life&quot;. He was a fan of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; before being hired for the show, and started work in . Due to the show&#x27;s long production cycle, season five did not air until the following September. Mirkin was the program&#x27;s first solo showrunner. Due to the high staff departure at the end of season four, Mirkin &quot;pretty much had to build [the] show from the ground up again&quot;, and noted that this &quot;was exciting but also a big challenge&quot;. He hired several new writers, including Richard Appel, David X. Cohen, Jennifer Crittenden, Greg Daniels, Bob Kushell, Jace Richdale and Mike Scully.

Mirkin&#x27;s tenure on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; has been cited as a period where the series evolved to focus more on abstract and surreal stories and humor. A. O. Scott notes that &quot;several veterans recall the &#x27;crazy David Mirkin years&#x27; as a time of wild inventiveness.&quot; In &quot;The Simpsons: An Uncensored, Unauthorized History&quot; (2009), John Ortved describes Mirkin&#x27;s era as moving the show away from more &quot;realistic&quot; emotional and character-based stories to &quot;pure comedy&quot; and &quot;surreal&quot; humor. In a 2004 interview with &quot;Animation Magazine&quot;, Mirkin stated that he felt that he &quot;brought [the show] back to a more story-oriented&quot; approach and increased the focus on characters and their emotions, although &quot;at the same time still keeping it surreal and weird&quot;. Mirkin moved the show&#x27;s focus toward Homer Simpson, and also developed some of its secondary characters, including Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. He also strongly opposed censorship and network interference, telling post-production supervisor Colin A.B.V. Lewis to ignore the list of changes sent by the Fox censors. He aimed to put &quot;as much blood and guts&quot; as possible into the episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror V&quot; as an attack on the censors.

Ortved—using interviews with writers Bob Kushell and Brent Forrester and Mirkin&#x27;s assistant Charleen Easton—describes Mirkin as an &quot;outsider&quot; on the show, with the writing staff, at least initially, divided with respect to Mirkin&#x27;s comedy and leadership style. Forrester described the latter as &quot;a little bit dictatorial&quot;. Mirkin conducted the show&#x27;s writing sessions in one room, rather than splitting the writers into two groups, as later showrunners would do, and often worked late into the night. Some praised Mirkin&#x27;s leadership, including Appel, who felt that &quot;the shows were great under him.&quot; Others criticised him, including Kushell, who clashed with Mirkin over the episode &quot;A Star is Burns&quot;, a crossover with &quot;The Critic&quot;. In 2004, Mirkin stated that he &quot;really wasn&#x27;t at all intimidat[ed] to join [the show&#x27;s writing] crew&quot;, because he &quot;had worked with and written with&quot; many of his fellow writers previously and concluded that, &quot;[I took] this show in a direction that is more personal to me. I did that, had a great time doing that, and everyone was very receptive to that.&quot; Mirkin&#x27;s era and style of humor are popular amongst the show&#x27;s fans.

The season five episode &quot;Deep Space Homer&quot;, in which the characters Homer and Barney are recruited by NASA, is Mirkin&#x27;s first writing credit on &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; the second being &quot;The Man Who Came to Be Dinner&quot;, which was co-written with Al Jean. Mirkin worked on the concept for a long time, basing the story on NASA&#x27;s Teacher in Space Project scheme to send ordinary civilians into space in order to spark interest amongst the general public. The idea proved controversial to some of the show&#x27;s writing staff, who felt that having Homer go into space was too &quot;large&quot; an idea. Series creator Matt Groening felt that the idea gave the writers &quot;nowhere to go&quot;. Based on these attitudes, several jokes were toned down to make the episode feel more realistic, including the impression that everyone at NASA was as stupid as Homer. During re-writes, Mirkin and the other writers placed greater emphasis on the relationship between Homer and his family and on Homer&#x27;s attempts to be a hero, but most of Mirkin&#x27;s original script was retained. The episode is considered one of the show&#x27;s best. Colin Kennedy of &quot;Empire&quot; magazine named it a &quot;contender for greatest ever episode&quot;, and in Chris Turner&#x27;s book, &quot;Planet Simpson&quot;, he says the episode is &quot;second to none&quot;. Regarding the long sequence that begins with Homer eating potato chips in the space shuttle and ends with Kent Brockman&#x27;s dramatic speech, Turner claimed that it was &quot;simply among the finest comedic moments in the history of television&quot;. A copy of the episode was later sent to the International Space Station for astronauts to view. Mirkin considers the episode to be &quot;very very special&quot;. Ortved says the episode, in its plot and surreal humor, epitomizes Mirkin&#x27;s era.

Mirkin pitched the plots for the episodes &quot;The Last Temptation of Homer&quot;, &quot;Bart&#x27;s Girlfriend&quot; and &quot;Homer the Great&quot;. He also produced the two-part episode &quot;Who Shot Mr. Burns?&quot;, which aired as the finale of season six and the premiere of season seven. The writers decided to write the episode in two parts with a mystery that could be used as a contest. Mirkin suggested Maggie Simpson as the culprit because he felt it was funnier and wanted the culprit to be a family member.

After season six, Mirkin suggested Oakley and Weinstein take over as showrunners, but remained on the show in an advisory capacity, helping them with technical aspects of the show such as editing and sound mixing, and attending table readings of the scripts. He was the executive producer for three other episodes from season seven: &quot;Lisa the Vegetarian&quot;, &quot;Radioactive Man&quot; and &quot;Team Homer&quot;. &quot;Lisa the Vegetarian&quot; was approved by Mirkin after the story was pitched by Cohen; Mirkin had just become a vegetarian himself, and so many of Lisa&#x27;s experiences in the episode were based on his own. Mirkin flew to London to record the episode&#x27;s guest stars Paul and Linda McCartney at Paul&#x27;s recording studio, where the McCartneys spent an hour recording their parts. Mirkin later said that recording with the McCartneys was one of the most &quot;amazing&quot; experiences of his life and considers the episode to be one of his favorites. Mirkin returned to the role of showrunner to produce the episodes &quot;The Joy of Sect&quot; and &quot;All Singing, All Dancing&quot; for season nine. He pitched the plot for &quot;The Joy of Sect&quot;, because he was attracted to the notion of parodies of cults, calling them &quot;comical, interesting and twisted&quot;.

 Mirkin still works part-time on the show as a consultant, helping with the re-write process. The show&#x27;s nine-month production cycle allows him to contribute to each episode in some form, whilst engaging in other projects as well. Mirkin also co-wrote &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot; in 2007, and the 3D animated short &quot;The Longest Daycare&quot; in 2012, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. Mirkin won four Primetime Emmy Awards and a Peabody Award for his work on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

===Subsequent work===
Mirkin directed the feature film &quot;Romy and Michele&#x27;s High School Reunion&quot; in 1997. The film stars Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow as two friends determined to show their former high school tormentors at their 10-year reunion that they have led successful lives. Mirkin said of the film: &quot;These are women characters we haven&#x27;t seen before. There are so few female buddy movies, written funny for women. Women don&#x27;t get to do odd, strange, self-involved roles like these.&quot; He knew Kudrow previously and felt she was &quot;perfect&quot; for the role, but did not expect Sorvino would take the part given her recent Academy Award win for &quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot;, but it &quot;turn[ed] out that she&#x27;d had a horrible time in high school, so the story appealed to her&quot;. The film received critical praise, as did Mirkin&#x27;s direction. James Berardinelli wrote that Mirkin &quot;brings a lot of energy to the production, always keeping things moving&quot;, while Jack Matthews of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; says Mirkin &quot;knew exactly what he had here and composed it like frames in a comic strip, ordering cheerful snow-cone colors for everything from the girls&#x27; childlike outfits to the decor of a Laundromat&quot;.

In 1999, several of the Fox executives who had disliked &quot;Get a Life&quot; came to Mirkin and apologized for the way they had treated the show, stating that they now found it funny. They commissioned Mirkin to write, produce and direct a similarly-themed show of his choice. Mirkin produced a pilot for &quot;Jeff of the Universe&quot;, a &quot;sarcastic&quot; parody of the science fiction genre. The executives who had disproved of &quot;Get a Life&quot; had since moved from the Fox Network to Fox Studios, and they liked this new show. However, the new executives at Fox did not, and chose not to air the show. Mirkin often plays clips from the show at the talks he does at colleges; they receive a positive response.

&quot;Heartbreakers&quot;, Mirkin&#x27;s second film as a feature director, was released in 2001. Mirkin rejected the project three times because he disliked the script. While he liked the idea of a mother and daughter con-woman team, he found the writing &quot;really broad&quot;, and &quot;it had no emotion in it.&quot; Eventually, Mirkin was allowed to rewrite the script himself, which he did in a year&#x27;s time. He filmed the project in Florida and Los Angeles and had a cameo appearance in the film as Jack&#x27;s lawyer. Reactions to both the film and Mirkin&#x27;s direction of it were more varied compared to &quot;Romy and Michele&#x27;s High School Reunion&quot;. Roger Ebert said the film was not &quot;as sly and has no ambition to be [as] charming&quot; as &quot;Romy and Michele&#x27;s High School Reunion&quot;, &quot;but in a season of dreary failed comedies it does what a comedy must: It makes us laugh&quot;. Chris Hewitt of &quot;Empire&quot; wrote that &quot;Mirkin&#x27;s direction is a little flat, but he&#x27;s clearly having tremendous fun,&quot; but Susan Wloszczyna of &quot;USA Today&quot; opined that Mirkin &quot;never gets the timing right and allows the story to drag with little internal logic&quot;.

Mirkin was attached to direct &quot;Sports Widow&quot; in 2004, a comedy starring Reese Witherspoon as a disregarded housewife who seeks to become an expert in American football in order to regain her husband&#x27;s attention; the project has never been completed. Mirkin is a fan of the musician James Taylor; Taylor guest starred in &quot;Deep Space Homer&quot; and Mirkin directed the music videos for his songs &quot;Enough to Be on Your Way&quot; and &quot;Sea Cruise&quot;. , Mirkin will write, direct and co-produce a biopic of businessman Richard Branson, based on his memoir &quot;Losing My Virginity&quot;.

==Personal life==
Mirkin is a vegetarian. In the early 1990s, Mirkin was in a relationship with actress Julie Brown, with whom he had worked on &quot;The Julie Show&quot; and &quot;The Edge&quot;.

<doc id="113152" wikidata="Q187004" url="?curid=113152" title="Carus">
<text>Marcus Aurelius Carus ( – July or August 283) was Roman emperor from 282 to 283. During his short reign, Carus fought the Germanic tribes and Sarmatians along the Danube frontier with success.

He died while campaigning against the Sassanid Empire and is believed to have died of unnatural causes. It was reported that he had been struck by lightning. He was succeeded by his sons Carinus and Numerian, creating a dynasty which, though short-lived, provided further stability to the resurgent empire.

==Biography==

Carus, whose name before the accession may have been Marcus Numerius Carus, was born, according to differing accounts, either in Gaul, Illyricum or Africa. Modern scholarship inclines to the former view, placing his birth at Narbo (modern Narbonne) in Gallia Narbonensis, though he was educated in Rome. Little can be said with certainty of his life and rule. Due to the decline of literature, the arts, and the want of any good historians of that age, what is known is almost invariably involved in contradiction and doubt. He was apparently a senator and filled various posts, both civil and military, before being appointed praetorian prefect by the emperor Probus in 282.

Two traditions surround his accession to the throne in August or September of 282. According to some mostly Latin sources, he was proclaimed emperor by the soldiers after the murder of Probus by a mutiny at Sirmium. Greek sources however claim that he rose against Probus in Raetia in a usurpation and had him killed. Allegedly, he initially refused the offer at first out of loyalty, but soon accepted. The often unreliable Historia Augusta is aware of both traditions, although it prefers the former. He does not seem to have returned to Rome after his accession, contenting himself with an announcement to the Senate. This was a marked departure from the constitutionalism of his immediate predecessors, Tacitus and Probus, who at least outwardly respected the authority of the senate, and was the precursor to the even more despotic military autocracy of Diocletian. Despite this, he still sought to deify the emperor Probus.

===Campaign against the Sassanids and death===

Carus bestowed the title of Caesar upon his sons Carinus and Numerian, then, in the beginning of 283, he elevated Carinus to the rank of Augustus, leaving him in charge of the western portion of the empire to look after some disturbances in Gaul and took Numerian with him on an expedition against the Persians, which had been contemplated by Probus. During his first campaign as emperor, he inflicted a severe defeat on the Quadi and Sarmatians on the Danube, for which he was given the title &quot;Germanicus Maximus.&quot; Reportedly, 16,000 Quadi were killed, with 20,000 being taken prisoner. Carus then proceeded through Thrace and Asia Minor, annexed Mesopotamia, pressed on to Seleucia and Ctesiphon, and marched his soldiers beyond the Tigris.

The Sassanid King Bahram II, limited by internal opposition and his troops occupied with a campaign in modern-day Afghanistan, could not effectively defend his territory. The Sasanians, faced with severe internal problems, could not mount an effective coordinated defense at the time; Carus and his army may have captured the Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon. The victories of Carus avenged all the previous defeats suffered by the Romans against the Sassanids, and he received the title of &quot;Persicus Maximus&quot;. Rome&#x27;s hopes of further conquest, however, were cut short by his death; Carus died in Sasanian territory, probably of unnatural causes, as he was reportedly struck by lightning. Alternate theories suggest that he died of illness, or that a rival for power poisoned him. Another theory hints at the future emperor Diocletian being involved in the killing. However, Leadbetter considered it unlikely for Carus to be assassinated, as his army had just won a victory.

== Legacy ==
Like the conquests of Trajan, 160 years before, Carus&#x27; gains were immediately relinquished by his successor. His son Numerian, naturally of an unwarlike disposition, was forced by the army to retreat back over the Tigris. The report of the lightning strike was evidently widely accepted in the camp, and the superstitious awe of the troops inclined them to ascribe Carus&#x27; death to the wrath of the Gods. Rumors had been spread of dark oracles, affixing the limits of the Empire on the Tigris, and threatening destruction against the Roman who should presume beyond the river in arms. Persia was abandoned to her rightful possessors, and not till Diocletian, a decade later, was the Persian contest decided in Rome&#x27;s favor, by that emperor&#x27;s decisive victory.

In the sphere of civil affairs, Carus is remembered principally for the final suppression of the authority of the senate, which had been partially restored under Tacitus and Probus. He declined to accept their ratification of his election, informing them of the fact by a haughty and distant dispatch. He was the last emperor to have united a civil with a military education, in that age when the two were increasingly detached; Diocletian (Imp. 284–305), who succeeded Carus after the brief reign of the latter&#x27;s sons, was to confirm and formalize the separation of professions, and the autocratic foundation of the imperial rule.

Though Carus was known throughout his life for his austere and virtuous manners, the suspicion of his complicity in Probus&#x27; death, along with his haughty conduct towards the senate, tarnished his reputation before his death, and Julian conspicuously placed him among the tyrants of Rome, in his catalogue of &quot;The Caesars&quot;.

<doc id="113153" wikidata="Q1648659" url="?curid=113153" title="America Eats Its Young">
<text>America Eats Its Young is the fourth studio album and the first double album by Funkadelic, released in May 1972. This was the first album to include the whole of the House Guests, including Bootsy Collins, Catfish Collins, Chicken Gunnels, Rob McCollough and Kash Waddy. It also features the Plainfield-based band U.S. (United Soul), which consisted of guitarist Garry Shider and bassist Cordell Mosson, on most of the tracks. Unlike previous Funkadelic albums, &quot;America Eats Its Young&quot; was recorded in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and in the UK. The original vinyl version contained a poster illustrated by Cathy Abel. The bottom of the poster features the first widespread appearance of the Funkadelic logo, which would appear on the cover of their next album &quot;Cosmic Slop&quot;.

==Composition==
According to Dave Rosen of &quot;Ink Blot&quot;, &quot;America Eats Its Young&quot; was radical in that it &quot;devours&quot; African-American music whole &quot;and regurgitates it back as a virtual catalog of styles and sounds. Containing no hit singles and precious few catchy tunes, &quot;America Eats Its Young&quot; is primarily an experimental record that doubles as a lesson in the history of black music.&quot; Dave Swanson of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; said that Funkadelic stripped away the &quot;sounds of rock, funk, soul and psychedelia&quot; that had defined their previous albums, instead delivering a &quot;hard funk offering&quot; Biographer Kris Needs described the album as Clinton&#x27;s &quot;grand statement&quot; on the Vietnam War and &quot;other elements that were afflicting his country&quot;, and further added that it featured Clinton&#x27;s &quot;most ambitiously epic production yet to befit the socially-conscious themes bristling among the love ditties and reworks.&quot;

==Critical reception==
Vernon Gibbs of &quot;Soul Sounds&quot; wrote in 1973 that most fans of Funkadelic were &quot;universal in their condemnation of certain parts of &quot;America Eats Its Young&quot;,&quot; while conceding it himself to have a &quot;dearth of top notch material&quot; for a double album, and said that the consensus highlights &quot;could not offset the badly thought out stuff&quot;. Robert Christgau wrote in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide&quot; (1981) that the album was marred by its double length, &quot;programmatic lyrics&quot; and usage of strings as well as Funkadelic&#x27;s continued use of sleeve notes by the Process Church of the Final Judgment, further singling out &quot;Biological Speculation&quot; and &quot;Loose Booty&quot; as the album&#x27;s only good songs.

Among retrospective reviews, Andrew Perry of &quot;Select&quot; panned the album as an unappealing, &quot;cluttered jazz-rock fusion&quot; that was alone in the Parliament-Funkadelic discography and which &quot;seldom [earned] the accolade of true funkadelia.&quot; He also felt Clinton was largely uninvolved with the album, which instead profiles &quot;vague polemic&quot; that provides &quot;neither the entertainment nor the hedonistic alternative of the moon-age anti-manifesto that was Clinton&#x27;s trademark&quot;. Christgau revisited the album for &quot;Blender&quot;, where he reiterated his dislike of the liner notes and described it as &quot;Funkadelic&#x27;s worst album&quot;, whose domination by Bernie Worrell scorched &quot;the widespread and plausible muso theory that his keyboards were what made P-Funk P-Funk. Strewing chaos and screwing his friends, George Clinton was what made P-Funk P-Funk.&quot; He later called it Clinton&#x27;s &quot;most Zappaesque&quot; album.

More positive was Ned Raggett of AllMusic, who described &quot;America Eats Its Young&quot; as a double album that was &quot;worth every minute of it&quot; and a departure from the &quot;endless slabs of double-album dreck that came around the same time&quot; as Funkadelic brought &quot;life, soul and much more to the party&quot;. &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; says that although &quot;America Eats Its Young&quot; is not Funkadelic&#x27;s best album, it &quot;introduces key elements that will lead Clinton to Parliament&quot;, such as vocal harmonies and Worrell&#x27;s playful, catchphrase-heavy humour, and favoured the &quot;party tunes&quot; over the album&#x27;s &quot;political anger&quot;. Dominique Leone of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called it a &quot;disparate, schizophrenic record&quot; where Clinton&#x27;s attempts to make it more crossover-friendly were thwarted by its length, adding &quot;there&#x27;s simply too much material, and too many conflicting directions to really make this seem anything other than a Frankenstein production.&quot; He nonetheless compared it to the Beatles&#x27; 1968 self-titled album due to it &quot;containing too much great stuff to dismiss, but by almost anyone&#x27;s standards, containing more than it needs.&quot; &quot;Mojo&quot; named it an &quot;expansive work by a huge funk collective&quot;.

<text>The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) is a LGBTQ+ rights organization.

It participates in a multitude of agendas within the United Nations, such as creating visibility for LGBTQ+ issues by conducting advocacy and outreach at the Human Rights Council, working with members to help their government improve LGBTI rights, ensuring LGBTI members are not forgotten in international law, and advocating for LBTI women&#x27;s issues at the Commission on the Status of Women.

==History==

The International Lesbian and Gay Association was founded in 1978 by activists from United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Australia, the United States, and elsewhere. Finding it difficult to repeal the criminalization of homosexuality based on the common law tradition, the activists adopted a human rights based framing and focused on international courts, especially the European Court of Human Rights as it was easier to access. ILGA was involved in the &quot;Dudgeon v. United Kingdom&quot; (1981) and &quot;Norris v. Ireland&quot; (1988) cases that led to the repeal of laws criminalizing homosexuality in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. At the same time, it worked on cases related to unequal ages of consent, military service, transgender rights, asylum and housing rights, but these did not lead to a successful outcome.

The Coventry conference also called upon Amnesty International (AI) to take up the issue of persecution of lesbians and gays. After a 13-year campaign AI made the human rights of lesbians and gays part of its mandate in 1991 and, following the Brazilian Resolution, now advocates for LGBT rights on the international level.

ILGA obtained consultative status at the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in mid-1993. Statements were made in the name of ILGA in the 1993 and 1994 sessions of the United Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities and in the 1994 session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. ILGA&#x27;s NGO status was suspended in September 1994 due to the group&#x27;s perceived ties with pro-pedophilia organizations such as the North American Man/Boy Love Association. According to then ILGA Secretary-General Hans Hjerpekjon, NAMBLA had officially affiliated with ILGA early in the group&#x27;s history when it was loosely structured and lacked any formal admission criteria, and had not withdrawn despite ILGA adopting a resolution condemning pedophilia. In June 1994, these groups were expelled from the organization. Later applications for ECOSOC consulatative status were declined in 2002 and 2006, with ILGA alleging external influence from Egypt and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in the latter instance. In June 2011, the ECOSOC finally granted consultative status to ILGA after a 29 to 14 vote, despite strong opposition from African and Islamic countries. Consultative status gives the ILGA the ability to attend and speak at UN meetings and participate in Human Rights Council proceedings.

ILGA, formerly known as International Lesbian and Gay Association, adopted its current full title, the &quot;International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association&quot;, in 2008. In 2019, following its World Conference in Wellington, New Zealand, the organisation&#x27;s membership approved to further update the name into &quot;ILGA World&quot;. ILGA has grown to include over 2,600 organizations from over 170 countries and territories to fight for equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex people.
ILGA was involved in getting the World Health Organization to drop homosexuality from its list of illnesses.

On 29 October 2024, the ILGA cancelled a bid from Israeli member organization Aguda, due to be voted on at the 2024 World Conference in Cape Town, to hold an upcoming Conference in 2026 or 2027 in Tel Aviv, following protests from South African delegates and member organizations over human rights and apartheid concerns. Aguda&#x27;s membership in ILGA was suspended and placed under review. Prior to the announcement, an emergency motion requesting the dismissal of the bid had been signed by over 70 member organizations worldwide. ILGA had previously made a statement on 22 October regarding concern over Aguda&#x27;s bid in which it stated that it did not formally endorse any host proposals until they were voted on by membership, and reaffirming its opposition to the Israel–Hamas war and to human rights violations. Aguda, expressing disappointment over the decision, stated its intention to appeal the suspension, while its chairwoman also stated that it had &quot;zero intentions of groveling or begging&quot;.

==Conferences==
According to its constitution, ILGA has a world conference in which all of its member organisations can attend. The world conference normally sets the time and place for the next conference. However, the Executive Board has used its power under the constitution to set an alternative venue, in the event the venue originally set becomes unviable, as was the case in 2008, when the originally chosen venue of Quebec had to be abandoned due to difficulties encountered by the local organizing committee in raising the necessary funds and the conference had to be held in Vienna instead. The 2010 ILGA world conference took place in São Paulo, Brazil, the 2012 Conference took place in Stockholm, and the 2014 Conference took place in Mexico City.

Protests often made the conferences that the organization held more dramatic and having more negative attention then would&#x27;ve been wanted. A problem encountered was financial in nature which recently came to a head when an ILGA conference actually had to be postponed because of lack of funding. In 2022, ILGA held its first world conference since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Long Beach, California.

=== International Intersex Forum ===
With a move to include intersex people in its remit, ILGA and ILGA-Europe have sponsored the only international gathering of intersex activists and organisations. The International Intersex Forum has taken place annually since 2011.

The third forum was held in Malta with 34 people representing 30 organisations &quot;from all continents&quot;. The closing statement affirmed the existence of intersex people, reaffirmed &quot;the principles of the First and Second International Intersex Fora and extend the demands aiming to end discrimination against intersex people and to ensure the right of bodily integrity, physical autonomy and self-determination&quot;. For the first time, participants made a statement on birth registrations, in addition to other human rights issues.

== Funding ==
ILGA&#x27;s main source of income are donations from governments, organizations, private foundations, amongst the contribution of individuals. In 2020, the total income of ILGA amounted to 2,213,268 CHF.

==Reports==

===State-Sponsored Homophobia===
In 2011, ILGA released its State-Sponsored Homophobia Report and map that brings to light 75 countries that still criminalize same-sex relationships between two consenting adults. These countries are mainly in Africa and in Asia.

In 2016, ILGA released an updated version of the &quot;State-Sponsored Homophobia Report&quot;. The report found that &quot;same-sex sexual acts&quot; are illegal in 72 countries. These countries are 37% of the States in the United Nations. Of these 72 countries, 33 are in Africa, 23 are in Asia, 11 are in the Americas, and six are in Oceania.

Historian Samuel Clowes Huneke criticized ILGA maps for showing most Western and non-Western countries in different colors, stating that while &quot;This division probably make sense to the casual observer... queer scholars and activists have noted that it also has colonial overtones&quot;.

=== Curbing Deception ===
In February 2020, ILGA launched &quot;Curbing Deception - A Comprehensive Global Survey on Legal Restrictions of &#x27;Conversion Therapies&quot;&#x27;. This research report examines laws at both national and subnational levels that prohibit efforts to change sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. Additionally, the report delves into a wide range of techniques historically and currently employed in an attempt to modify the sexual orientation of lesbians, gays, and bisexuals, impede transgender youth from transitioning, induce detransitioning in transgender individuals, or enforce adherence to societal stereotypes of masculinity and femininity regarding gender expression and roles.

=== Our Identities under Arrest ===
&quot;Our Identities under Arrest&quot; is the first publication specifically focusing on the enforcement of laws that criminalize consensual same-sex sexual acts and diverse gender expressions at a global level. It goes beyond the black letter law to track how these provisions are effectively enforced. The first edition was published in December 2021 and it reviewed over 900 instances in which law enforcement authorities have subjected LGBTQ+ and gender-diverse individuals to fines, arbitrary arrests, prosecutions, corporal punishments, imprisonments, and potentially even the death penalty.

The report provides evidence revealing the significant underreporting of arrests and prosecutions across different countries. It highlights the notable gap between official records on enforcement published by certain governments (such as Morocco, Uzbekistan, Cameroon, and Sri Lanka) and the number of instances documented through alternative sources collected by ILGA World for this report. The report also found that judicial prosecution is a poor indicator to assess levels of enforcement, as arrests and detentions without formal judicial proceedings are the predominant methods of enforcing criminalizing provisions. In many countries, individuals can be detained for extended periods, ranging from several days to weeks or even months, without any form of judicial or administrative review.

The report also highlights the fluctuating nature of the enforcement of criminalizing provisions, which can vary in frequency and intensity over time, with periods characterized by a significant increase in documented instances, followed by periods with no recorded or documented cases of enforcement. The report found that in many criminalizing countries, authorities and law enforcement officials sporadically enforce these provisions in ways that are often unpredictable. Even countries that are considered &quot;safe&quot; or where little information on enforcement is available can experience sudden and unexpected shifts in their approach to these provisions.

===Global Attitudes Survey===
In 2016, ILGA published its &quot;2016 Global Attitudes Survey on LGBTI People&quot;. The principal subject surveyed was attitudes about &quot;sexual orientation&quot;.

<text>Julie Deborah Kavner (born September 7, 1950) is an American actress. Before becoming well-known for her voice role as Marge Simpson on the animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Kavner attracted notice for her role as Brenda Morgenstern, the younger sister of Valerie Harper&#x27;s title character in the sitcom &quot;Rhoda&quot;, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. She also voices other characters for &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, including Marge&#x27;s mother, Jacqueline Bouvier, sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier, and half-step-great-aunt Eunice Bouvier.

Known for her improvisation and distinctive &quot;honeyed gravel voice&quot;, Kavner was cast in her first professional acting role as Brenda Morgenstern in &quot;Rhoda&quot; in 1974. Starting in 1987, Kavner appeared on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;. &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; included a series of animated shorts about a dysfunctional family. Voices were needed for the shorts, and the producers asked Kavner to voice Marge. The shorts were spun off into &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

Kavner has been described as &quot;nearly reclusive&quot;; part of her contract says that she will never have to promote &quot;The Simpsons&quot; on video. For her work as Marge, Kavner received another Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992 and an Annie Award nomination for her performance as the character in &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot; (2007).

Typically cast as a &quot;woman who is supportive, sympathetic or self-effacingly funny&quot;, Kavner grew to dislike playing such roles. In 1992, she starred in &quot;This Is My Life&quot;, her first leading role in a feature film. Kavner has also appeared in live-action roles in six films written by Woody Allen and in the Adam Sandler comedy &quot;Click&quot;.

==Early life==
Kavner was born in Los Angeles, California, on September 7, 1950, the second daughter of Rose, a family counselor, and David Kavner, a furniture manufacturer, and grew up in Southern California. She decided to pursue a career in acting because &quot;There was nothing else I wanted to do, ever&quot;. She attended Beverly Hills High School (which she later admitted she hated), where she was &quot;something of a loner&quot;, and unsuccessfully tried out for several plays. John Ingle, formerly the chairman of the Beverly Hills High School art department, later commented that Kavner was &quot;excellent at improvisation, but she wasn&#x27;t an ingenue [sic] and not that castable at that age&quot;.

After graduating from high school, Kavner attended San Diego State University and majored in drama, being cast in several productions including a role as Charlotte Corday in &quot;Marat/Sade&quot;, becoming known for her improvisation and ability to do both comedy and drama. After graduating in 1971, she got a day job as a typist at the UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture.

==Career==

===Early career===

In 1973, Kavner auditioned for a role as one of Rhoda Morgenstern&#x27;s sisters in &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;. David Davis, producer of the show, had convinced her to audition for the part, but decided to cast another actress instead. A year later, Rhoda Morgenstern became the leading character in a spin-off called &quot;Rhoda&quot;. Kavner was cast in her first professional acting role as Brenda Morgenstern, sister of the eponymous character. &quot;Rhoda&quot; ran on CBS from September 9, 1974, to December 1978. She received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Continuing Performance by a Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for playing Brenda, winning in 1978. She also received four Golden Globe Award nominations. In 1975, she received Daytime Emmy Award nomination for her starring role in the daytime special &quot;The Girl Who Couldn&#x27;t Lose&quot;.

Following &quot;Rhoda&quot;, Kavner had a guest appearance on &quot;Taxi&quot; and appeared in the 1985 comedy &quot;Bad Medicine&quot; as well as the 1987 film &quot;Surrender&quot;, both of which were box office failures (and also starred Steve Guttenberg). She appeared in the television movies &quot;Revenge of the Stepford Wives&quot;, &quot;No Other Love&quot; and &quot;A Fine Romance&quot;, and shot a television pilot. She also starred in several stage plays, including a play called &quot;It Had to Be You&quot; at a dinner theater in Canada, &quot;Particular Friendships&quot; in New York City in 1981, and &quot;Two for the Seesaw&quot;, directed by Burt Reynolds. Woody Allen first saw Kavner one night while he was watching &quot;Rhoda&quot; in the 1970s. He thought that she was remarkable and later offered her a role in his 1986 film &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot;. Kavner agreed, and credits Allen and the film with rejuvenating her career.

Kavner was then cast as a sidekick to Tracey Ullman in &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, which debuted on Fox in 1987. Kavner described the show as, &quot;like being back in school, a chance to play a wide variety of characters, some really vicious people, to not rest on laurels, to not play it safe&quot;. Kavner commented, &quot;What I do is not mimicry or an impersonation, but more of an assimilation. [On &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;] we did a lot of looking at people to find out who to base our characters on. We did our homework on our lunch hour.&quot; She received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Best Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program.

===&quot;The Simpsons&quot;===
Kavner became known for her role as Marge Simpson on the animated television show &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, a show that continues to the present day. &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; included a series of animated shorts about the dysfunctional Simpson family. Voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask Kavner and fellow cast member Dan Castellaneta to voice Marge and Homer rather than hire more actors. Kavner has what Hilary de Vries of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as a &quot;honeyed gravel voice&quot;. Kavner says her voice is due to &quot;a bump on [her] vocal cords&quot;.

Although Marge is her highest profile character on the show, Kavner&#x27;s favorite characters to voice are Marge&#x27;s sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier because &quot;they&#x27;re really funny and sad at the same time&quot;. Series creator Matt Groening instructed Kavner to voice the duo as characters who &quot;suck the life out of everything&quot;. Both have similar raspy voices, but Patty&#x27;s voice is more masculine and has a lower register, while Selma&#x27;s voice is a little sweeter. Kavner also provides the voices of every other female member of the Bouvier family, including Marge&#x27;s mother Jacqueline, Great-Aunt Gladys (a dead relative who was introduced on season four&#x27;s &quot;Selma&#x27;s Choice&quot;), and an unnamed grandmother seen on the season six episode &quot;Fear of Flying&quot;.

While cast members and crew have referenced Kavner as a deep fan of the series and the characters she voices, part of Kavner&#x27;s contract says that she will never have to promote &quot;The Simpsons&quot; on video nor has she performed Marge&#x27;s voice in public because she believes the publicity &quot;destroys the illusion. People feel these are real people.&quot; Kavner takes recording sessions seriously, and feels that voice acting is &quot;a little more limiting than live acting. And I have nothing to do with my character&#x27;s movement.&quot; Nancy Cartwright, who voices Bart Simpson, said in her book &quot;My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy&quot; (2000) that Kavner is a warm person who is &quot;a workhorse of an actor&quot; with &quot;extraordinary professionalism and quiet work ethic&quot;, and notes that she is rarely late for recording sessions. Kavner had very few recorded interviews in regard to her work on the show. In behind-the-scenes footage from 1992, she describes Marge as &quot;a wonderful person&quot; with &quot;a great sex life&quot;. On a 1994 appearance on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, Kavner explains that performing the voice of Marge in a live-action setting would break the illusion of the character, and that she does not want her own likeness to overlap with that of the character. However, after being coaxed by Letterman, Kavner turns to face away from the camera and speaks briefly in the voice of Marge.

Until 1998, Kavner was paid $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing to cast new voices. However, the dispute was soon resolved and she received $125,000 per episode until 2004 when the voice actors demanded that they be paid $360,000 an episode. The issue was resolved a month later, and Kavner earned $250,000 per episode. After salary re-negotiations in 2008, the voice actors received approximately $400,000 per episode. Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Kavner and the other cast members accepted a 30 percent pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode.

At the 44th Primetime Emmy Awards, Kavner received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for voicing Marge in the season three episode &quot;I Married Marge&quot;. In 2004, Kavner and Dan Castellaneta won a Young Artist Award for Most Popular Mom &amp; Dad in a TV Series. For her performance in &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, Kavner was nominated for Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature at the 2007 Annie Awards, but Ian Holm from &quot;Ratatouille&quot; received the award. Kavner&#x27;s emotional performance in the movie got positive reviews, and one critic said she &quot;gave what must be the most heartfelt performance ever to find its way into a movie based on an irreverent cartoon&quot;. Some scenes in the movie, such as Marge&#x27;s emotional video message to Homer, were recorded over 100 times, leaving Kavner exhausted.

===Further career===

Many of Kavner&#x27;s roles have been described by &quot;New York Times&quot; writer Hilary de Vries as a &quot;woman who is supportive, sympathetic, or self-effacingly funny&quot;. Kavner grew to despise playing such roles, saying &quot;If it smacks of Brenda Morgenstern, I won&#x27;t take the job.&quot; She had a supporting role as Eleanor Costello, a nurse who befriends Robin Williams&#x27; character in the Academy Award nominated film &quot;Awakenings&quot; (1990). Kavner interviewed several nurses in preparation for the role, and Penny Marshall, the director of the film, described Kavner as &quot;a low-maintenance actor [...] You never have to worry about giving [her] back-story for her characters.&quot; In 1992, Kavner starred in &quot;This Is My Life&quot;, her first leading role in a feature film. Kavner played Dottie Ingels, an aspiring stand-up comedian who starts neglecting her family when her career begins to take off. Kavner described Dottie as &quot;really selfish&quot; but admitted, &quot;I liked the role for that very reason.&quot; Kavner had been asked to play a character with a smaller role in the film, but Joe Roth, at the time the chairman of 20th Century Fox, suggested that they cast a lesser known actress in the lead role. Nora Ephron, the writer of &quot;This Is My Life&quot;, said Kavner &quot;has so little vanity that it is almost shocking. Not only does she have no demands as an actress – &#x27;How big is my trailer, what&#x27;s in my refrigerator?&#x27; – but she will do anything for the character if it makes sense to her.&quot;

Kavner has frequently appeared in Woody Allen films, having roles in &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; (1986), &quot;Radio Days&quot; (1987), &quot;New York Stories&quot; (1989), &quot;Alice&quot; (1990), &quot;Shadows and Fog&quot; (1991), the television movie &quot;Don&#x27;t Drink the Water&quot; (1994) and &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot; (1997). Allen described her as &quot;a naturally funny person. When she does a scene, you listen to her and look at her, and the prism through which it&#x27;s all filtered is funny.&quot; Kavner believes he is &quot;a true filmmaker, one that has something to say, continually experimenting on different themes within his own film-making&quot;, adding that &quot;anything [Allen] ever does, I always want to do, [...] I don&#x27;t even have to read it.&quot;

She has done voice-over work in films such as &quot;The Lion King 1½&quot; (2004), &quot;Dr. Dolittle&quot; (1998) and an uncredited role as an announcer in &quot;A Walk on the Moon&quot; (1999). She worked with Tracey Ullman in the HBO sketch comedy series &quot;Tracey Takes On...&quot; She was cast as the mother of Adam Sandler&#x27;s character in &quot;Click&quot;, released in 2006. She has not appeared in a non-&quot;Simpsons&quot; role since her appearance in &quot;Click&quot;.

==Personal life==
Kavner is Jewish. She has lived in New York City&#x27;s Manhattan borough since around 1992. She leads an intensely private life, described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;nearly reclusive&quot; and &quot;discreet and guarded beyond the usual reticent star routine&quot;. She rarely makes public appearances and refuses to be photographed while working. She was in a relationship with producer David Davis from 1976 until his death in 2022. Neither of them confirmed being married, though reports referred to her as his wife at the time of his death.

In 1983, &quot;Current Biography&quot; referred to Kavner as an avid athlete and pescetarian. In a 1992 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, she said she was considering retiring &quot;except for doing three days a year for Woody [Allen]&quot;, but had a feeling that she would receive a script she wanted &quot;to do more than life itself&quot; upon retiring.

<text>Nancy Jean Cartwright (born October 25, 1957) is an American actress. She is the long-time voice of Bart Simpson on the animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, for which she has received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance and an Annie Award for Best Voice Acting in the Field of Animation. Cartwright also voices other characters for the show, including Maggie Simpson, Ralph Wiggum, Todd Flanders, and Nelson Muntz. She is also the voice of Chuckie Finster in the Nickelodeon series &quot;Rugrats&quot; and its spin-off &quot;All Grown Up!&quot;, succeeding Christine Cavanaugh.

Cartwright was born in Dayton, Ohio. She moved to Hollywood in 1978 and trained under voice actor Daws Butler. Her first professional role was voicing Gloria in the animated series &quot;Richie Rich&quot;, which she followed with a starring role in the television movie &quot;Marian Rose White&quot; (1982) and her first feature film, &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot; (1983). In 1987, Cartwright auditioned for a role in a series of animated shorts about a dysfunctional family that was to appear on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;. Cartwright intended to audition for the role of Lisa Simpson, the middle child; when she arrived at the audition, she found the role of Bart—Lisa&#x27;s brother—to be more interesting. Series creator Matt Groening allowed her to audition for Bart and offered her the role on the spot. She voiced Bart for three seasons on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, and in 1989, the shorts were spun off into a half-hour show called &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

Besides &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Cartwright has also voiced numerous other animated characters, including Daffney Gillfin in &quot;Snorks&quot;, Mellissa Screetch in &quot;Toonsylvania&quot;, Rufus in &quot;Kim Possible&quot;, Mindy in &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, Pistol in &quot;Goof Troop&quot;, the Robots in &quot;Crashbox&quot;, Margo Sherman in &quot;The Critic&quot; and Todd Daring in &quot;The Replacements&quot;. In 2000, she published her autobiography, &quot;My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy&quot;, and four years later, adapted it into a one-woman play. In 2017, she wrote and produced the film &quot;In Search of Fellini&quot;.

==Early life==
Nancy Jean Cartwright was born on October 25, 1957, in Dayton, Ohio. She was the fourth of six children born to Frank and Miriam Cartwright. She grew up in Kettering, Ohio, and discovered her talent for voices at an early age. While in the fourth grade at the school of St. Charles Borromeo, she won a school-wide speech competition with her performance of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;How the Camel Got His Hump&quot;. Cartwright attended Fairmont West High School, and participated in the school&#x27;s theater and marching band. She regularly entered public speaking competitions, placing first in the &quot;Humorous Interpretation&quot; category at the National District Tournament two years running. The judges often suggested to her that she should perform cartoon voices. Cartwright graduated from high school in 1976 and accepted a scholarship from Ohio University. She continued to compete in public speaking competitions; during her sophomore year, she placed fifth in the National Speech Tournament&#x27;s exposition category with her speech &quot;The Art of Animation&quot;.

In 1976, Cartwright landed a part-time job doing voice-overs for commercials on WING radio in Dayton. A representative from Warner Bros. Records visited WING and later sent Cartwright a list of contacts in the animation industry. One of these was Daws Butler, known for voicing characters such as Huckleberry Hound, Snagglepuss, Elroy Jetson, Spike the Bulldog, and Yogi Bear. Cartwright called him and left a message in a Cockney accent on his answering machine. Butler immediately called her back and agreed to be her mentor. He mailed her a script and instructed her to send him a tape recording of herself reading it. Once he received the tape, Butler critiqued it and sent her notes. For the next year, they continued in this way, completing a new script every few weeks. Cartwright described Butler as &quot;absolutely amazing, always encouraging, always polite&quot;.

Cartwright returned to Ohio University for her sophomore year, but transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) so she could be closer to Hollywood and Butler. Her mother, Miriam, died late in the summer of 1978. Cartwright nearly changed her relocation plans but, on September 17, 1978, &quot;joylessly&quot; left for Westwood, Los Angeles.

==Career==

===Early career===

While attending UCLA, which did not have a public speaking team, Cartwright continued training as a voice actress with Butler. She recalled, &quot;every Sunday I&#x27;d take a 20-minute bus ride to his house in Beverly Hills for a one-hour lesson and be there for four hours ... They had four sons, they didn&#x27;t have a daughter and I kind of fitted in as the baby of the family.&quot; Butler introduced her to many of the voice actors and directors at Hanna-Barbera. After she met the director Gordon Hunt, he asked her to audition for a recurring role as Gloria in &quot;Richie Rich&quot;. She received the part, and later worked with Hunt on several other projects. At the end of 1980, Cartwright signed with a talent agency and landed a lead role in a pilot for a sitcom called &quot;In Trouble&quot;. Cartwright described the show as &quot;forgettable, but it jump-started my on-camera career&quot;. She graduated from UCLA in 1981 with a degree in theater. During the summer, Cartwright worked with Jonathan Winters as part of an improvisation troupe at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio.

Returning to Los Angeles, Cartwright won the lead role in the television film &quot;Marian Rose White&quot;. Janet Maslin, a critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, described Cartwright as &quot;a chubby, lumbering, slightly cross-eyed actress whose naturalness adds greatly to the film&#x27;s impact&quot;. Cartwright replied by sending Maslin a letter insisting she was not cross-eyed, and included a photograph. Later, Cartwright auditioned for the role of Ethel, a girl who becomes trapped in a cartoon world in the third segment of &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot;. She met with director Joe Dante and later described him as &quot;a total cartoon buff, and once he took a look at my resume and noticed Daws Butler&#x27;s name on it, we were off and running, sharing anecdotes about Daws and animation. After about twenty minutes, he said, &#x27;considering your background, I don&#x27;t see how I could cast anyone &quot;but&quot; you in this part! It was her first role in a feature film. The segment was based on &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; television series episode &quot;It&#x27;s a Good Life&quot;, which was later parodied in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror II&quot; (1991).

Cartwright continued to do voice work for projects including &quot;Pound Puppies&quot;, &quot;Popeye and Son&quot;, &quot;Snorks&quot;, &quot;My Little Pony&quot; and &quot;Saturday Supercade&quot;. She joined a &quot;loop group&quot;, and recorded vocals for characters in the background of films, although in most cases the sound was turned down so that very little of her voice was heard. She did minor voice-over work for several films, including &quot;The Clan of the Cave Bear&quot; (1986), &quot;Silverado&quot; (1985), &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; (1984), &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot;, and &quot;The Color Purple&quot; (1985). Cartwright also voiced a shoe that was &quot;dipped&quot; in acid in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988), describing it as her first &quot;off-screen death scene&quot;, and worked to correctly convey the emotion involved.

In 1985, she auditioned for a guest spot as Cynthia in &quot;Cheers&quot;. The audition called for her to say her line and walk off the set. Cartwright decided to take a chance on being different and continued walking, leaving the building and returning home. The production crew was confused, but she received the part. In search of more training as an actress, Cartwright joined a class taught by Hollywood coach Milton Katselas. He recommended that Cartwright study &quot;La Strada&quot;, a 1956 Italian film starring Giulietta Masina and directed by Federico Fellini. She began performing &quot;every imaginable scene&quot; from &quot;La Strada&quot; in her class and spent several months trying to secure the rights to produce a stage adaptation. She visited Italy with the intention of meeting Fellini and requesting his permission in person. Although they never met, Cartwright kept a journal of the trip and later wrote a one-woman play called &quot;In Search of Fellini&quot;, partially based on her voyage. The play was co-written by Peter Kjenaas, and Cartwright won a Drama-Logue Award after performing it in Los Angeles in 1995. In a 1998 interview, she stated her intention to make it into a feature film, which she succeeded in doing in 2017.

===&quot;The Simpsons&quot;===
Cartwright voices the character Bart Simpson on the long-running animated television show &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. On March 13, 1987, she auditioned for a series of animated shorts about a dysfunctional family that was to appear on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, a sketch comedy program. Cartwright had intended to audition for the role of Lisa Simpson, the elder daughter. After arriving at the audition, she found that Lisa was simply described as the middle child and at the time did not have much personality. Cartwright became more interested in the role of Bart, described as &quot;devious, underachieving, school-hating, irreverent, [and] clever&quot;. Creator Matt Groening let her try out for Bart and gave her the job on the spot. Bart&#x27;s voice came naturally to Cartwright, as she had previously used elements of it in &quot;My Little Pony&quot;, &quot;Snorks&quot;, and &quot;Pound Puppies&quot;. Cartwright describes Bart&#x27;s voice as easy to perform compared with other characters. The recording of the shorts was often primitive; the dialog was recorded on a portable tape deck in a makeshift studio above the bleachers on the set of &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;. Cartwright, the only cast member to have been professionally trained in voice acting, described the sessions as &quot;great fun&quot;. However, she wanted to appear in the live-action sketches and occasionally showed up for recording sessions early, hoping to be noticed by a producer.

In 1989, the shorts were spun off into a half-hour show on the Fox network called &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Bart quickly became the show&#x27;s breakout personality and one of the most celebrated characters on television—his popularity in 1990 and 1991 was known as &quot;Bartmania&quot;. Bart was described as &quot;television&#x27;s brightest new star&quot; by Mike Boone of &quot;The Gazette&quot; and was named 1990&#x27;s &quot;entertainer of the year&quot; by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. Despite Bart&#x27;s fame, however, Cartwright remained relatively unknown. During the first season of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Fox ordered Cartwright not to give interviews, because they did not want to publicize the fact that Bart was voiced by a woman. Cartwright&#x27;s normal speaking voice is said to have &quot;no obvious traces of Bart&quot;, and she believes her role is &quot;the best acting job in the world&quot; since she is rarely recognized in public. When she is recognized and asked to perform Bart&#x27;s voice in front of children, Cartwright refuses because it &quot;freaks [them] out&quot;. Bart&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;Eat My Shorts&quot; was an ad-lib by Cartwright in one of the original table readings, referring to an incident from her high school days. Once while performing, members of the Fairmont West High School marching band switched their chant from the usual &quot;Fairmont West! Fairmont West!&quot; to the irreverent &quot;Eat my shorts!&quot; Cartwright felt it appropriate for Bart, and improvised the line; it became a popular catchphrase on the show.

Cartwright voices several other characters on the show, including Nelson Muntz, Ralph Wiggum, Todd Flanders, Kearney, and Database. She first voiced Nelson in the episode &quot;Bart the General&quot; (season one, 1990). The character was to be voiced by Dana Hill, but Hill missed the recording session and Cartwright was given the role. She developed Nelson&#x27;s voice on the spot and describes him as &quot;a throat-ripper&quot;. Ralph Wiggum had originally been voiced by Jo Ann Harris, but Cartwright was assigned to voice the character in &quot;Bart the Murderer&quot; (season three, 1991). Todd Flanders, the only voice for which Cartwright used another source, is based on Sherman (voiced by Walter Tetley), the boy from &quot;Peabody&#x27;s Improbable History&quot;, a series of shorts aired on &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;.

Cartwright received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992 for her performance as Bart in the episode &quot;Separate Vocations&quot; and an Annie Award in 1995 for Best Voice Acting in the Field of Animation. Bart was named one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century by &quot;Time&quot;, and in 2000, Bart and the rest of the Simpson family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard.

Until 1998, Cartwright was paid $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors and made preparations for casting new actors. The dispute was resolved, however, and Cartwright received $125,000 per episode until 2004, when the voice actors demanded $360,000 an episode. A compromise was reached after a month, and Cartwright&#x27;s pay rose to $250,000 per episode. Salaries were re-negotiated in 2008 with the voice actors receiving approximately $400,000 per episode. Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Cartwright and the other cast members accepted a 25 percent pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode.

===Further career===
In addition to her work on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Cartwright has voiced many other characters on several animated series, including Chuckie Finster in &quot;Rugrats&quot; and &quot;All Grown Up!&quot;, Margo Sherman in &quot;The Critic&quot;, Mindy in &quot;Animaniacs,&quot; and Rufus the naked mole-rat in &quot;Kim Possible&quot;. For the role of Rufus, Cartwright researched mole-rats extensively, and became &quot;a font of useless trivia&quot;. She was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program in 2004 for her work on the show. In 2001, Cartwright took over the &quot;Rugrats&quot; role of Chuckie Finster when Christine Cavanaugh retired. Cartwright describes Rufus and Chuckie as her two most difficult voices: &quot;Rufus because my diaphragm gets a workout while trying to utilize the 18 vocal sounds a mole makes. Chuckie because ... he&#x27;s an asthmatic with five personalities rolled into one—plus I have to do the voice the way [Cavanaugh] did it for 10 years.&quot; Other television shows that have used her voice work include &quot;Galaxy High,&quot; &quot;God, the Devil and Bob,&quot; &quot;Goof Troop,&quot; &quot;Mike, Lu &amp; Og,&quot; &quot;The Replacements,&quot; &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot; and &quot;Timberwolf&quot;. Cartwright has appeared on camera in numerous television shows and films, including &quot;Fame&quot;, &quot;Empty Nest&quot;, &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot;, &quot;Godzilla,&quot; and &quot;24&quot;.

In 2000, Cartwright published her autobiography, &quot;My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy&quot;. The book details her career (particularly her experiences as the voice of Bart) and contains stories about life behind the scenes of &quot;The Simpsons.&quot; Laura A. Bischoff of the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot; commented that the book was the &quot;ultimate insider&#x27;s guide to &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&quot;. Critics complained that the book lacked interesting stories and was aimed mostly at fans of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; rather than a general audience.

Cartwright adapted &quot;My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy&quot; into a one-woman play in 2004. Cartwright has performed it at a variety of venues, including the August 2004 Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Scotland. The play received modest reviews, including criticism for a lack of inside stories about &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and its &quot;overweeningly upbeat&quot; tone. David Chatterton of &quot;The British Theatre Guide&quot; described the show as &quot;interesting and entertaining, but not really a &#x27;must see&#x27; even for Simpsons fans&quot;.

Cartwright has shown an interest in stock car racing and as of 2007 was seeking a NASCAR license. In 2001, she founded a production company called SportsBlast and created an online animated series called &quot;The Kellys&quot;. The series is focused on racing; Cartwright voices a seven-year-old named Chip Kelly.

In 2016, Cartwright launched Spotted Cow Entertainment, her own film and television production company, with Peter Kjenaas, Monica Gil and Kevin Burke. With a focus on international audiences, Spotted Cow is seeking &quot;to finance, produce and acquire live action and animated films, television series, as well as entertainment for digital platforms with budgets up to $15M.&quot; With Spotted Cow, Cartwright made her first film as a screenwriter and producer, &quot;In Search of Fellini&quot;, which was released on September 15, 2017. Based on her own journey to Italy in 1985 in a bid to meet the famed director Federico Fellini, the film fulfilled Cartwright&#x27;s longtime vision of turning her 1995 one-woman play &quot;In Search of Fellini&quot; into a film.

==Personal life==
Cartwright met real-estate agent Warren Murphy, 24 years her senior, on her birthday in 1988 and married him two months later. In her book, she describes Murphy as her &quot;personal laugh track&quot;. The couple had two children, Lucy and Jack, before divorcing in 2002.

Cartwright was raised a Roman Catholic but joined the Church of Scientology in 1991. She was awarded Scientology&#x27;s Patron Laureate Award after donating $10,000,000, almost twice her annual salary, to the Church in 2007.

Cartwright is a contributor to ASIFA-Hollywood&#x27;s Animation Archive Project. In September 2007, Cartwright received the Make-A-Wish Foundation&#x27;s &quot;Wish Icon&quot; Award &quot;for her tremendous dedication to the Foundation&#x27;s fundraising and wish-fulfillment efforts.&quot; In 2005, Cartwright created a scholarship at Fairmont High School &quot;designed to aid Fairmont [graduates] who dream of following in her footsteps and studying speech, debate, drama or music&quot; at Ohio University. In 2005, Cartwright was given the title of Honorary Mayor of Northridge, California (a neighborhood of Los Angeles) by the Northridge Chamber of Commerce.

In 2007, Cartwright was in a romantic relationship with contractor Stephen Brackett, a fellow member of Scientology. In early 2008, the couple had made plans to marry, but Brackett died by suicide in May 2009.

In 2012, Cartwright received an honorary doctorate degree in communication from Ohio University, where she was a student from 1976 to 1977 before transferring to UCLA.

Cartwright is also a painter, sculptor and philanthropist. She co-founded the Know More About Drugs alliance.

Sabrina Carpenter is her niece through Cartwright&#x27;s stepbrother David Carpenter.

<text>Henry Albert Azaria ( ; born April 25, 1964) is an American actor and comedian. He is known for voicing many characters in the long-running animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot; since 1989, including Moe Szyslak, Chief Wiggum, Superintendent Chalmers, Comic Book Guy, Snake Jailbird, Professor Frink, Kirk Van Houten, Duffman, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Lou, Carl Carlson, among others. Azaria joined the show with little voice acting experience, but became a regular in its second season. For his work on the show, he has won four Primetime Emmy Awards.

Alongside his continued voice acting on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Azaria became more widely known through his live-action supporting appearances in films such as &quot;Quiz Show&quot; (1994), &quot;Heat&quot; (1995), &quot;The Birdcage&quot; (1996) (for which he won a Screen Actors Guild Award) and &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1998). He has also appeared in numerous films including &quot;Mystery Men&quot; (1999), &quot;America&#x27;s Sweethearts&quot; (2001), &quot;Shattered Glass&quot; (2003), &quot;Along Came Polly&quot; (2004), &quot;Run Fatboy Run&quot; (2007), &quot;Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian&quot; (2009) and &quot;The Smurfs&quot; (2011) and &quot;The Smurfs 2&quot; (2013). Further voice roles include &quot;Anastasia&quot; (1997), for which he won an Annie Award.

His live-action television work includes recurring roles on the sitcoms &quot;Mad About You&quot; and &quot;Friends&quot;, as well as dramatic roles in the TV films &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot; (1999) as writer Mitch Albom and &quot;Uprising&quot; (2001) as Jewish resistance leader Mordechai Anielewicz. For the former, Azaria received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie. He starred in the title roles in the Showtime drama series &quot;Huff&quot; (2004–2006) and the IFC sitcom &quot;Brockmire&quot; (2017–2020). His recurring role on the drama &quot;Ray Donovan&quot; earned him a sixth Primetime Emmy Award in 2016.

Azaria made his Broadway debut as Lancelot in &quot;Spamalot&quot;, for which he was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. He returned to Broadway in 2007, playing David Sarnoff in &quot;The Farnsworth Invention&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Henry Albert Azaria was born in the Manhattan borough of New York City on April 25, 1964 to Ruth and Albert Azaria. He began going by the name &quot;Hank&quot; as a child, after a pediatrician he visited said he felt it was a more suitable name for a child than &quot;Henry&quot;. His grandparents on both sides were Sephardic Jews from the Greek city of Thessaloniki. His family spoke Ladino, also known as Judaeo-Spanish, which he described as &quot;a strange, antiquated Spanish dialect written in Hebrew characters.&quot; Azaria&#x27;s father ran several dress-manufacturing businesses while his mother raised him and his two older sisters, Stephanie and Elise. Before marrying his father, Azaria&#x27;s mother had been a publicist for Columbia Pictures, promoting films in Latin American countries as she was fluent in both English and Spanish. During his childhood, Azaria would often &quot;memorize and mimic&quot; the scripts of films, shows, and stand-up comedy routines he enjoyed.

Azaria attended The Kew-Forest School in Queens&#x27; Forest Hills neighborhood. He decided to become an actor after performing in a school play at the age of 16, becoming &quot;obsessed with acting&quot; at the expense of his academic studies. Both of his parents loved all forms of show business, which further spurred him to become an actor. He studied drama at Tufts University from 1981 to 1985, where he met and befriended actor Oliver Platt and noted that Platt was a &quot;better actor&quot; than he was and inspired him. Together they starred in various college stage productions, including &quot;The Merchant of Venice,&quot; before Azaria went to train at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. Although he did not expect the endeavor to be successful, he decided to become a professional actor so that he would not regret not having tried later in life. His first acting job was an advertisement for Italian television when he was 17 years old. He also worked as a busboy. He originally intended to work predominantly as a theatrical actor, and he and Platt set up a company called Big Theatre, although Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Dumb Waiter&quot; was the only show they ever performed. Azaria decided that television was a better arena and offered more opportunity, and moved to Los Angeles after being offered work with talent agent Harry Gold.

==Career==
===Early career (1986–1988)===
Azaria got along with talent agent Harry Gold, who was lukewarm about working with him but still sent him out for auditions after a woman Azaria had worked with in New York &quot;got really furious with [Gold]&quot; for breaking his promise to work with Azaria. He made his television debut with a role in the pilot episode of the 1986 ABC comedy-drama series &quot;Joe Bash&quot;. His part—a one-line role as the police officer Maldonado—was edited out before the show was broadcast, although the role secured him admission to the Screen Actors Guild. Azaria appeared in the TV film &quot;Nitti: The Enforcer&quot;, about the gangster Frank Nitti, and appeared in the failed pilot &quot;Morning Maggie&quot; alongside Matthew Perry, with whom he became good friends. He played Joe in an episode of the sitcom &quot;Family Ties&quot; in 1988 in which he had one line, and the following year he played Steve Stevenson in an episode of &quot;Growing Pains&quot;. Azaria has described his career progression as being gradual; he did not achieve overnight recognition or fame. In Los Angeles, Azaria was trained by acting coach Roy London. Between acting jobs he performed as a stand-up comedian, and worked as a bartender for a catering firm.

===&quot;The Simpsons&quot; (since 1989)===
Azaria is known for his voice work in the ongoing animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. He joined the show having previously performed only one voice-over—as the titular animated dog in the failed Fox pilot &quot;Hollywood Dog&quot;, a show he described as &quot;sort of Roger Rabbit-esque, where the dog was animated, but everybody else was real.&quot; The first voice he performed on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was that of town bartender Moe Szyslak, replacing Christopher Collins who had initially recorded the character&#x27;s voice. Having known him from &quot;Hollywood Dog&quot;, casting director Bonita Pietila called Azaria and asked him to audition for the voice of Moe. At the time he was performing the role of a drug dealer in a play, utilizing a voice based on Al Pacino&#x27;s performance in the film &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;. He used the voice in his audition for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and, at the request of the show&#x27;s executive producers Matt Groening and Sam Simon, made the voice more &quot;gravelly&quot;. Groening and Simon thought the resultant voice was ideal for Moe and took Azaria over to the Fox recording studio. Before he had even seen a script, he recorded several lines of dialogue as Moe for the episode &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;, dubbing Collins&#x27; voice.

Azaria did not expect to hear from the show again, but they continued to call him back, first to perform the voice of Chief Wiggum and then Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. He felt that, initially, &quot;[the producers] didn&#x27;t seem too pleased with what I had done...[Simon] was very exacting...[and] was kind of impatiently directing me on the ABCs of comedy. But then, much to my surprise, he would still keep having me back every week. But each week, I thought it was going to be my last week because I really didn&#x27;t think I had done that well.&quot; Nevertheless, by the show&#x27;s second season he was performing multiple recurring voices and so was given a contract and made a permanent member of the main cast. Since he joined later than the rest of the cast, Groening still considered Azaria the &quot;new guy&quot;. In addition to Moe, Wiggum and Apu, Azaria provides the voices of Comic Book Guy, Carl Carlson (until season 32, now voiced by Alex Désert), Cletus Spuckler, Professor Frink, Dr. Nick Riviera, Lou, Snake Jailbird, Kirk Van Houten, Bumblebee Man, the Sea Captain, Superintendent Chalmers, Disco Stu, Duffman, the Wiseguy, and numerous guest characters. His co-star in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Nancy Cartwright, wrote that: &quot;The thing about Hank that I most remember is that he started out so unassuming and then, little by little, his abilities were revealed and his contributions to the show escalated. I realized Hank was going to be our breakaway star.&quot;

As Moe&#x27;s voice is based on Al Pacino&#x27;s, likewise many of Azaria&#x27;s other recurring characters are based on existing sources. He took Apu&#x27;s voice from the many Indian and Pakistani convenience store workers in Los Angeles that he had interacted with when he first moved to the area, and also loosely based it on Peter Sellers&#x27; character Hrundi V. Bakshi from the film &quot;The Party&quot;. Originally, it was thought that Apu being Indian was too offensive and stereotyped, but after Azaria&#x27;s reading of the line &quot;Hello, Mr. Homer&quot;, which the show&#x27;s producers thought was hilarious, the character stayed. Azaria, however, disputed this on &quot;LateNet with Ray Ellin&quot;, claiming that Apu was always intended to be stereotypical. Chief Wiggum&#x27;s voice was originally a parody of David Brinkley, but when Azaria was told it was too slow, he switched it to that of Edward G. Robinson. Officer Lou is based on Sylvester Stallone, and Dr. Nick is &quot;a bad Ricky Ricardo impression.&quot; The &quot;Wise Guy&quot; voice is &quot;basically Charles Bronson,&quot; while Carl is &quot;a silly voice [Azaria] always did.&quot; Two of the voices come from his time at college: Snake&#x27;s is based on Azaria&#x27;s old college roommate, while Comic Book Guy&#x27;s voice is based on a student who lived in the room next door to Azaria and went by the name &quot;F&quot;. Professor Frink is based on Jerry Lewis&#x27; performance in the original &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;, and the Sea Captain is based on English actor Robert Newton&#x27;s portrayal of many pirates. Azaria based his performance for the one-time character Frank Grimes, from the episode &quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot;, on actor William H. Macy. He counts Grimes as the hardest, most emotional performance he has ever had to give in the history of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

Azaria&#x27;s work on the show has won him four Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance, in 1998, 2001, 2003 and 2015. He was also nominated for the award in 2009 and 2010, but lost to co-star Dan Castellaneta and guest star Anne Hathaway respectively. He was nominated again in 2012. Azaria, with the rest of the principal cast, reprised all of his voice roles from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; for the 2007 film &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;. Azaria notes that he spends &quot;an embarrassingly small amount of time working on &quot;The Simpsons.&quot;&quot; He works for &quot;an hour on Thursdays when we read through the script, then four hours on Monday when we record it, and I&#x27;ll pop in again once or twice.&quot; He concludes it is &quot;the best job in the world, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&quot;

Up until 1998, Azaria was paid $30,000 per episode. Azaria and the five other main &quot;The Simpsons&quot; voice actors were then involved in a pay dispute in which Fox threatened to replace them with new actors and went as far as preparing for the casting of new voices. However, the issue was soon resolved and from 1998 to 2004, they received $125,000 per episode. In 2004, the voice actors intentionally skipped several script read-throughs, demanding they be paid $360,000 per episode. The strike was resolved a month later, with Azaria&#x27;s pay increasing to something between $250,000 and $360,000 per episode. In 2008, production for the twentieth season was put on hold due to new contract negotiations with the voice actors, who wanted a &quot;healthy bump&quot; in salary. The dispute was later resolved, and Azaria and the rest of the cast received their requested pay raise, approximately $400,000 per episode. Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Azaria and the other cast members accepted a 30 percent pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode.

In an April 24, 2018 appearance on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, Azaria discussed his reaction to &quot;The Problem with Apu&quot;, a 2017 documentary by Hari Kondabolu that examined Azaria and other white actors who had played South Asian roles as stereotypes. During the interview, Azaria described how watching the documentary had changed his perspective on the issue: &quot;The idea that anyone, young or old, past or present, was bullied or teased based on the character of Apu, it just really makes me sad.&quot; Azaria also offered to stop voicing the character: &quot;I&#x27;m perfectly willing and happy to step aside, or help transition it into something new.&quot; In response, Kondabolu tweeted his appreciation for Azaria&#x27;s statement: &quot;Thank you, @HankAzaria. I appreciate what you said &amp; how you said it.&quot; In early 2020, Azaria announced that he was stepping away from the Apu character, primarily because of the stereotypes and bias it perpetuated. Later in the year he would retire from voicing Carl for similar reasons. In April 2021, Azaria formally apologized for voicing the Apu character, on Dax Shepherd&#x27;s podcast.

===Further career (since 1991)===

====Television work====

With the continuing success of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Azaria began taking on other, principally live-action roles. He was a main cast member on the show &quot;Herman&#x27;s Head&quot; (1991–1994) playing Jay Nichols, alongside &quot;The Simpsons&quot; co-star Yeardley Smith. He regularly recorded for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and filmed &quot;Herman&#x27;s Head&quot; during the same day. Following the series&#x27; cancellation Azaria unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of Joey Tribbiani, one of the lead characters in the sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;. He was instead cast in the role of the scientist David, one of Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow)&#x27;s boyfriends in the series. He appeared in the show&#x27;s tenth episode &quot;The One with the Monkey&quot;, before the character left for a research trip in Minsk. He reprised the role in the show&#x27;s seventh season (2001), before making several appearances in the ninth (2003). This return culminates in David proposing to Phoebe; she rejects him, and David leaves the show for good. From 1995 to 1999, Azaria had a recurring role in the sitcom &quot;Mad About You&quot; as Nat Ostertag, the dog walker. Azaria was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his roles in both &quot;Mad About You&quot; (in 1998) and &quot;Friends&quot; (in 2003). Azaria had the lead role in the short-lived sitcom &quot;If Not for You&quot; in 1995, playing record producer Craig Schaeffer.

Azaria produced and starred in the sitcom &quot;Imagine That&quot; in 2002, replacing &quot;Emeril&quot; mid-season in the NBC lineup. He played Josh Miller, a comedy writer, who &quot;transformed&quot; each episode into a character Miller has imagined, &quot;provid[ing] a humorous outlet for his frustrations at home and work&quot;. Production closed after five episodes and it was canceled after just two aired, due to poor critical reaction and ratings. Azaria later commented on the show: &quot;I wanted to do something really truthful and interesting and impactful. We had a bunch of executives sitting in the room, all agreeing that &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; was our favorite thing on television, but we couldn&#x27;t do it on NBC, and nor would we want to from a business standpoint; it simply wouldn&#x27;t make enough money. By the time it aired, the writing was sort of on the wall, and I don&#x27;t blame them at all. It was apparent it wasn&#x27;t working.&quot;

He starred as psychiatrist Craig &quot;Huff&quot; Huffstodt in the Showtime drama series &quot;Huff&quot;, which ran for two seasons between 2004 and 2006, airing 24 episodes. Azaria served as an executive producer on the show and directed an episode of its second season. After reading the pilot script, he sent it to Platt, who took the role of Huff&#x27;s friend Russell Tupper. Azaria enjoyed working on the show, but struggled with the bleak subject matter and was often in dispute with its creator Bob Lowry, noting that it &quot;was tough to marry our visions all the time, [because] we both cared so much about it that neither of us were willing to let go.&quot; Gillian Flynn of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called Azaria &quot;impressively subtle&quot; in the role, while John Leonard of &quot;New York magazine&quot; said he was a &quot;shrewd bit of casting.&quot; The show garnered seven Emmy nominations in 2005, including a nomination for Azaria for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. Despite the awards, the show continually received low ratings, and Showtime chose not to commission it for a third season.

Returning to live-action television in 2011, Azaria starred in the NBC sitcom &quot;Free Agents&quot;, a remake of the British series of the same name. He played Alex Taylor, a recently divorced public relations executive &quot;who is missing his kids and trying to keep himself together&quot;, and ends up sleeping with a co-worker Helen Ryan (Kathryn Hahn). Azaria also served as a producer on the show. He was apprehensive about the project, disliking the lengthy schedule required of a lead actor in a single-camera series, and favoring the &quot;sensibility&quot; of cable shows. However, he liked the script and executive producer John Enbom&#x27;s previous series &quot;Party Down&quot; and decided to accept the part. Despite Azaria mounting a campaign on Twitter to save it, the series was canceled after four episodes due to low ratings. Between 2014 and 2016, Azaria had a recurring role in the second, third and fourth season of Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Ray Donovan&quot;, playing FBI agent Ed Cochran. He won the Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for his work on the show in 2016, as well as earning a further nomination the same category the following year.

Azaria starred in the IFC series &quot;Brockmire&quot;, which ran for four seasons from 2017-2020. He played the lead role of Jim Brockmire, a legendary baseball announcer, fired for a profanity-filled breakdown live on air after discovering his wife Lucy Brockmire (Katie Finneran) was having an affair. Azaria based the voice and style of Brockmire on several veteran sportscasters, including Bob Murphy and Phil Rizzuto. The character originated as part of the third episode of the Funny or Die web-series &quot;Gamechangers&quot;, entitled &quot;A Legend in the Booth&quot;, which Azaria also co-wrote. He subsequently appeared as Brockmire on the NFL Network&#x27;s &quot;The Rich Eisen Podcast&quot; to discuss the National Football League. In November 2012, Azaria sued actor Craig Bierko over the ownership of the Brockmire voice. The case was ruled in Azaria&#x27;s favor in 2014. Both actors had been using a baseball announcer voice before and since meeting at a party in 1990, but US district judge Gary Allen Feess ruled that only Azaria&#x27;s voice was, as Brockmire, a defined, &quot;tangible&quot; character and thus subject to copyright. In 2016, IFC confirmed development on the series, on which Azaria also served as an executive producer. Azaria received three nominations for the Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Comedy Series for his performance on the series.

====Film work====

Azaria made his film debut in the direct-to-video release &quot;Cool Blue&quot; (1990), as Buzz. His first theatrically released feature film appearance came the same year in &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;, as a police detective named Albertson. His next major film role was as television producer Albert Freedman in the 1994 film &quot;Quiz Show&quot;, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. In 1996, Azaria played gay Guatemalan housekeeper Agador Spartacus in the film &quot;The Birdcage&quot;. For the role, which Azaria considers to be his &quot;big break&quot;, he was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role, and critically branded &quot;the most hilarious performance in the film,&quot; by Alison Macor of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;, while &quot;Empire&quot; wrote that he &quot;[stole] the show.&quot; For the role he used a Guatemalan accent, and made himself sound as effeminate as possible. He had chosen two possible voices, an effeminate one and a tougher one. After advice from a drag queen, he chose the effeminate voice. Three weeks into production, he realized he sounded exactly like his grandmother, which aided his performance. Agador was originally going to be a single scene part, with the larger role of the housekeeper being played by David Alan Grier. With the producers fearing the racial connotations of a black actor in such a part, Azaria inherited the full role.

He appeared in numerous other films in the late 1990s, including &quot;Heat&quot; (1995), &quot;Grosse Pointe Blank&quot; (1997), &quot;Celebrity&quot; (1998) and worked opposite Gwyneth Paltrow, as Walter Plane, in the 1998 adaptation of &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. He played photographer Victor &quot;Animal&quot; Palotti in &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1998). &quot;Godzilla&quot; was one of Azaria&#x27;s first starring roles in a blockbuster film. Its five-month shoot was the longest of his career to date, but he considered it a good chance to boost his profile. He noted, &quot;I&#x27;m so used to melding into every character I play. Even people in the business think the guy who did &quot;Birdcage&quot;, &quot;Quiz Show&quot; and &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are three different actors—which in a way makes me proud, but in another way is very frustrating. It&#x27;s the curse and blessing of the character actor&quot;. The shoot&#x27;s physical challenges, and the film&#x27;s critical failure, led Azaria to later describe it as &quot;tough to make, and very disappointing when it came out. It was one you definitely chalk up and say, &#x27;That was part of paying your dues, better luck next time&#x27;.&quot; In 1999, he starred in the drama &quot;Mystery, Alaska&quot; as Charles Danner, and the comedy superhero film &quot;Mystery Men&quot;, as the faux-British silverware throwing expert The Blue Raja. Other film roles included Hector Gorgonzolas in &quot;America&#x27;s Sweethearts&quot; (2001), Claude in &quot;Along Came Polly&quot; (2004), and the young Patches O&#x27;Houlihan in &quot;&quot; (2004), the latter two with Ben Stiller. For his role of Claude, a French scuba instructor, in &quot;Along Came Polly&quot;, Azaria donned a wig and worked out extensively to get into the physical shape the part required.

Azaria played composer Marc Blitzstein in Tim Robbins&#x27; film &quot;Cradle Will Rock&quot; in 1999. Paul Clinton wrote that Azaria was &quot;brilliant as the tortured (is there any other kind) artist Blitzstein.&quot; The same year he appeared as author and journalist Mitch Albom alongside Jack Lemmon in the television film &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot;, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the role. Azaria described the latter as the &quot;best work [he has] done.&quot; These were two of the first dramatic roles Azaria had taken; throughout his career, Azaria has primarily worked in comedy, but tries to balance the two. Azaria commented: &quot;all the roles I got were in comedy at first, and I was certainly happy to get those, so I never felt the lack of being considered a dramatic actor because I was so happy to get what I got. And then I became surprised later on when I got dramatic roles. But I never went, &#x27;OK, now it&#x27;s time to get a dramatic role.&#x27;&quot; His next dramatic part was in the television film &quot;Uprising&quot; in 2001. The film was based on the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and Azaria played Mordechaj Anielewicz, one of the revolt&#x27;s leaders. Azaria was confused by his casting in &quot;Uprising&quot; and frequently asked the film&#x27;s producer and director Jon Avnet why he was selected. &quot;I know [Avnet] liked the fact I was Jewish, and he knew I could do accents well. He cast me and David Schwimmer in [&quot;Uprising&quot;], and we were both sort of mystified. He had some instinct that he wanted people who were more known for being funny. He never explained it satisfactorily to me; I don&#x27;t understand why.&quot; His parts in &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot; and &quot;Uprising&quot; affected him, causing a depressive state which he countered with DVDs of the comedy series &quot;Monty Python&quot;. Azaria found &quot;Uprising&quot; to be &quot;very difficult very depressing very emotionally challenging&quot; material. In 2003, Azaria played journalist Michael Kelly, the former editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot;, in the drama film &quot;Shattered Glass&quot;. Kelly died a few months before the film was released and Azaria said the film &quot;has become a weird kind of eulogy to him.&quot;

Since &quot;Huff&quot;″s conclusion in 2006, Azaria has continued to make multiple film appearances. He played the smooth-talking Whit Bloom in David Schwimmer&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Run Fatboy Run&quot; (2007). During production he became good friends with co-star Simon Pegg, performing &quot;The Simpsons&quot; voices on request, frequently distracting Pegg when he was supposed to be filming. He worked with Stiller again on 2009&#x27;s &quot;Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian&quot; in which Azaria played the villainous pharaoh Kah Mun Rah, utilizing a Boris Karloff accent. Although the film received mixed reviews, critics praised Azaria&#x27;s performance. Perry Seibert of &quot;TV Guide&quot; wrote that &quot;thanks to Azaria, a master of comic timing. His grandiose, yet slightly fey bad guy is equally funny when he&#x27;s chewing out minions as he is when deliberating if Oscar the Grouch and Darth Vader are evil enough to join his team.&quot; He appeared as Abraham in &quot;Year One&quot; (2009), Dr. Stan Knight in 2010&#x27;s &quot;Love &amp; Other Drugs&quot;, and played &quot;Deep Throat&quot; director Gerard Damiano in &quot;Lovelace&quot; (2013).

Azaria played Gargamel in the animated/live-action adaptation of &quot;The Smurfs&quot; (2011). Azaria wore a prosthetic nose, ears, buck teeth, eyebrows and a wig, as well as shaving his head. He spent approximately 130 hours in the make-up chair over the course of the production. Azaria considered Gargamel&#x27;s voice to be the most important part of his performance. The producers wanted an &quot;old, failed, Shakespearean actor&quot; voice, but Azaria felt this would lack energy and wanted something more Eastern European. He eventually selected a voice similar to that of Paul Winchell&#x27;s from the cartoon. Azaria disliked the cartoon when it first aired, and considered Gargamel too one-dimensional a character and &quot;just this straight villain&quot;; he opted to make Gargamel &quot;more sarcastic&quot; than in the cartoon, but &quot;discovered that there&#x27;s no way to play Gargamel without screaming your head off at certain points – ramping him up and getting him very upset over Smurfs&quot;. He interpreted him as &quot;very lonely&quot;, adding that &quot;he hates the Smurfs because they&#x27;re such a happy family. He wants in really badly. I think he wants to be embraced as a Smurf&quot;. Azaria worked with the writers to &quot;infuse&quot; the script with some of his ideas about the character, &quot;particularly with the &#x27;married&#x27; relationship between Gargamel and [his cat] Azreal &quot; which Azaria conceived.

Reviewers from &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot; and &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; commented on Azaria&#x27;s &quot;overacting&quot; in the role of Gargamel. More positive reaction came from Scott Bowles of &quot;USA Today&quot; called Azaria the &quot;human standout&quot;; Betsy Sharkey of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; felt he suffered the &quot;greatest disservice&quot; of the film&#x27;s cast due to a poor script. Azaria noted in an interview with &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; that &quot;The Smurfs&quot; and &quot;Night at the Museum&quot; were films he agreed to do primarily for the money, but that &quot;I won&#x27;t even do that unless I think it will at least be fun to do...I really try to throw myself into it, figure out the funniest, cleverest way to get the material over, and make it fun to do and fun to watch.&quot; Azaria reprised his role in the 2013 sequel &quot;The Smurfs 2&quot;. In 2016, Azaria starred in &quot;Norman&quot; with Richard Gere.

====Further voice work====
Azaria performed a number of voice roles in addition to &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, although he noted in 2005: &quot;I started doing other voiceovers for cartoons for a couple of years, but I didn&#x27;t really love it. I was spoiled by &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.&quot; He voiced Eddie Brock / Venom in &quot;Spider-Man: The Animated Series&quot; between 1994 and 1996. In the animated feature &quot;Anastasia&quot; (1997), he voiced Bartok the bat and reprised the role in the direct-to-video prequel &quot;Bartok the Magnificent&quot; (1999). For his performance in &quot;Anastasia&quot;, Azaria won the Annie Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Voice Acting by a Male Performer in an Animated Feature Production. He also voiced Eric in the American dub of the series &quot;Stressed Eric&quot;, Harold Zoid in the 2001 &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;That&#x27;s Lobstertainment!&quot;, and Abbie Hoffman and Allen Ginsberg in &quot;Chicago 10&quot; (2007). For the 2011 film &quot;Hop&quot;, Azaria voiced Carlos and Phil. The response to the film was mostly negative, but many reviewers praised Azaria&#x27;s performance. For example, Sandie Chen of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said &quot;Azaria has been honing his over-the-top Spanish accent since &quot;The Birdcage&quot;, so anything he says grabs some laughs&quot;, while Emma Simmonds of &quot;Time Out&quot; called him an &quot;unflappable presence, voicing two characters with style&quot;. Later in the year he voiced The Mighty Sven in &quot;Happy Feet Two&quot;. He also voiced the lead character, Texan border agent Bud Buckwald, in &quot;Bordertown&quot;, which aired in 2016, as well as Shelfish Sheldon in &quot;Mack &amp; Moxy&quot; the same year.

Once &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was &quot;going steadily&quot; and Azaria had enough money to live on, he stopped working on commercials as he found them &quot;demoralizing&quot;, feeling that he sounded sarcastic whenever he read for them. When recording the part of &quot;Jell-O Man&quot; for a Jell-O commercial, he was told to make the voice he offered &quot;more likable and friendly so that children like him.&quot; After pointing out that &quot;Jell-O Man&quot; was a fictional character, he left and pledged to never record for an advertisement again. However, in 2012 he voiced several insects in a commercial for the Chevrolet Sonic.

====Other work====
Azaria wrote and directed the 2004 short film &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Perfect&quot;, which won the Film Discovery Jury Award for Best Short at the US Comedy Arts Festival. In January 2007, he was confirmed to be directing &quot;Outsourced&quot;, a film about two American workers who journey to get their jobs back, after their factory is moved to Mexico. In 2009, Azaria told &quot;Empire&quot; he was instead focusing on making a documentary about fatherhood. Two years later he told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that this project was &quot;half-complete&quot; and was &quot;forever looking for financing to finish it.&quot; It eventually began in 2014, airing on AOL as an online series titled &quot;Fatherhood&quot;. According to AOL, the series of short episodes documents Azaria&#x27;s &quot;touching, humorous, and often enlightening journey from a man who is not even sure he wants to have kids, to a father going through the joys, trials and tribulations of being a dad.&quot;
He has periodically returned to theatrical work, appearing in several productions. In 2003, he appeared as Bernard in a run of David Mamet&#x27;s play &quot;Sexual Perversity in Chicago&quot;, along with Matthew Perry and Minnie Driver, in London&#x27;s West End. Azaria made his first appearance as Sir Lancelot, the French Taunter, and four other characters in &quot;Spamalot&quot;, the musical version of &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;, which opened in Chicago in December 2004, before moving to the Shubert Theatre on Broadway. The show met with critical acclaim and received fourteen Tony Award nominations in 2005; Azaria and Tim Curry both received nominations for the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical. Reuniting with &quot;The Birdcage&quot; director Mike Nichols, and being a huge &quot;Monty Python&quot; fan, he saw it as an opportunity he could not pass up, describing it as &quot;so much fun that I haven&#x27;t realized how tiring it is,&quot; and &quot;the most fun that I&#x27;ve ever had in my entire life.&quot; He took a break from the show in June 2005 to work on &quot;Huff&quot;, but returned in December 2005. Alan Tudyk played the role during Azaria&#x27;s absence. In late 2007 he starred in Aaron Sorkin&#x27;s &quot;The Farnsworth Invention&quot;, playing RCA head David Sarnoff. In 2016, he starred in the world premiere of &quot;Dry Powder&quot; opposite Claire Danes, John Krasinski, and Sanjit De Silva, directed by Thomas Kail, at the off-Broadway Public Theater in New York City.

In August of 2024, after his 60th birthday, Azaria began touring with Bruce Springsteen tribute act Hank Azaria and the EZ Band.

==Acting style and vocal range==
Azaria&#x27;s friends refer to him as &quot;the freakish mimic&quot; due to his ability to copy almost anyone&#x27;s voice, instantly after he has heard it. As a child, he believed that everyone could do this, but later realized that it was not a common talent. Azaria has said, &quot;I can remember every voice I hear, famous or otherwise ... they kind of remain in the memory banks, so I&#x27;m ready to trot them out.&quot; Azaria was glad to have found the &quot;ultimate outlet&quot; for this skill, in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. He &quot;didn&#x27;t realize it [when he joined the show], but it became like a lab for a character actor. [He] had to do so many voices.&quot; In the early 2000s, Azaria felt he had reached the maximum number of voices he was capable of: &quot;For the first 10 years of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, I would develop a bunch of voices. And then ... I hit a point when I was tapped out. Every noise I can make, I have made. Even characters like Gargamel, I&#x27;ve done. Even if it was only two or three lines, at some point I&#x27;ve done something similar on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, at least somewhere along the line.&quot;

For many of Azaria&#x27;s characters, much of their humor is derived from a &quot;funny voice&quot;, such as &quot;The Birdcage&quot; and &quot;Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian&quot;. He stated that &quot;being funny with a funny voice is more my comfort zone, a broader character that I try to humanize, a kind of silly or wacky persona that I try to fill in,&quot; although he finds it &quot;much easier to be someone much closer to myself,&quot; as it requires &quot;less energy ... than playing characters that are so out there and high strung.&quot;

&quot;The Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening has stated that Azaria possesses the ability to turn unfunny lines into some of the best in an episode, while former writer Jay Kogen stated: &quot;Just when I think I know [Azaria&#x27;s] bag of tricks, he&#x27;s always got a new thing he does to surprise me.&quot; Throughout the run of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Azaria has had to sing in character several times, a task which he describes as easier than singing normally. &quot;The Smurfs&quot; writer David N. Weiss says Azaria &quot;has a beautiful treasure trove of talent,&quot; and &quot;became what you wished you were writing.&quot; Playwright Jenelle Riley wrote in 2005 that Azaria was &quot;by far&quot; her favorite actor, praising his &quot;versatility&quot; and &quot;tendency to take small roles that would normally fade into the background and to consistently create characters people care about,&quot; noting his roles in &quot;Shattered Glass&quot;, &quot;Mystery, Alaska&quot; and especially &quot;&quot;.

==Personal life==
In the early 1990s, Azaria was in a relationship with actress Julie Warner. His relationship with actress Helen Hunt began in 1994; they married in a traditional Jewish ceremony at the couple&#x27;s home in Southern California on July 17, 1999. The two had appeared together in &quot;Mad About You&quot; and the &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Dumbbell Indemnity&quot;. After a year of marriage, Azaria moved out of the couple&#x27;s home, and Hunt filed for divorce after a six-month separation, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce was finalized on December 18, 2000.

Azaria began dating former actress Katie Wright in 2007, and the two married later that year. They have a son named Hal (b. 2009). The family has one dog, Truman, and two rescue cats, Mookie and Wilson. In 2013, the family began renting a home on 80th Street in Manhattan, with plans to make a final decision on where to live in two years. They previously lived in a four-bedroom house in Pacific Palisades, which Azaria bought from his &quot;Simpsons&quot; co-star Dan Castellaneta in 2011. Several weeks earlier, Azaria had sold his home in Bel Air. Azaria previously owned the fifth-floor co-op loft on Mercer Street in Manhattan&#x27;s Soho neighborhood, which he bought from photographer Cindy Sherman in 2005, before selling it in 2013.

As his dogs&#x27; names suggest, Azaria is a huge fan of the New York Mets. He is also a fan of the New York Jets.

Azaria suffered from alcoholism for several years. He credited his longtime friend Matthew Perry for encouraging him to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and has been sober since about 2006.

Azaria is the godfather of Oliver Platt&#x27;s son, George. He is also a regular poker player, appearing twice on &quot;Celebrity Poker Showdown&quot; and competing at other events, finishing a few places short of the bubble in the main event of the 2010 World Series of Poker. Azaria is a supporter of the Democratic Party. He enjoys the music of Elvis Costello and has stated that he would have been a therapist if he were not an actor. Azaria co-founded the educational support charity, &quot;Determined to Succeed&quot;.

On May 22, 2016, he was awarded the Honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters (DHL) from Tufts University.

<text>Teressa Claire &quot;Tress&quot; MacNeille (; born June 20, 1951) is an American voice actress, who has contributed to voice-over work with credits including voicing Dot Warner on the animated television series &quot;Animaniacs&quot; and its revival, Babs Bunny on &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, Colleen on &quot;Road Rovers&quot;, Chip and Gadget Hackwrench on &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;, Anastasia Tremaine in various &quot;Cinderella&quot; media since 1994 and Daisy Duck in various Disney media since 1999. She has also worked on animated series such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot;, &quot;Disenchantment&quot;, &quot;Rugrats&quot;, and &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;

==Early life==
MacNeille loved cartoons as a child and wanted to be a voice actress from the age of eight, but instead chose a &quot;practical&quot; career, feeling she would never be able to realise her ambition. She graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, and attended broadcasting school, becoming a disc jockey.

==Career==
MacNeille worked in numerous jobs and had many minor voiceover roles before becoming a regular on an animated TV show. In her words: &quot;I&#x27;d been doing radio spots, some TV, demos, sound-alikes, industrial narrations—anything that came my way for about two years.&quot; She was also a member of the improvisational comedy group The Groundlings for ten years. MacNeille took acting workshops and worked as a casting assistant for voice acting talent agent Bob Lloyd in what she calls &quot;The University of Voice-over&quot;. Lloyd and fellow agent Rita Vennari got MacNeille her first role on an animated show: a part in an episode of the 1979 &quot;Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo&quot;.

She sang and appeared (as Lucille Ball) in the music video for &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s song &quot;Ricky&quot; (1983), which was based on the &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; television show and parodied the song &quot;Mickey&quot; by Toni Basil. MacNeille and Mary Kay Bergman also appeared on Yankovic&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Running with Scissors&quot;, on the tracks &quot;Pretty Fly for a Rabbi&quot; and &quot;Jerry Springer&quot;.

MacNeille was cast as Babs Bunny in &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; (1990–1992). Writer Paul Dini said that MacNeille was good for the role because she could do both Babs&#x27;s voice and the voices of her impressions. MacNeille commented: &quot;The best part of doing Babs is that she&#x27;s a mimic, like me...In the show I do Babs doing Billie Burke, Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis, Madonna, and Cher. I even have her doing Jessica Rabbit.&quot; The success of &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; led to the series &quot;Animaniacs&quot;. MacNeille was brought in to voice Dot Warner, one of the show&#x27;s three main characters, because Dot&#x27;s character was very similar to Babs Bunny. Andrea Romano, the voice director and caster for &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, said that the casters had &quot;no trouble&quot; choosing the role of Dot: &quot;Tress MacNeille was just hilarious (...) And yet [she had] that edge.&quot; MacNeille was nominated for an Annie Award for her performance on the show in 1995.

She has provided voices for numerous films, television shows, video games and commercials, garnering over 200 credits. MacNeille says: &quot;The characters that I do all come from people in my own life – as well as the material I&#x27;ve stolen from my friends!&quot;. Her TV roles include characters on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, where she voices Agnes Skinner, Brandine Spuckler and Lindsey Naegle, and &quot;Futurama&quot;, in which her main role was the character Mom. MacNeille has provided voices on many other television shows and cartoons such as &quot;Rugrats&quot; (as Charlotte Pickles), &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale Rescue Rangers&quot; (as Chip and Gadget Hackwrench), &quot;TaleSpin&quot; (as Kitten Kaboodle), &quot;Histeria!&quot;, &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; and &quot;Dave the Barbarian&quot; (as Fang), as well as dubbing work on English-language anime translations.

She is the voice of Daisy Duck and Wilma Flintstone since 1999 and 2000 respectively. MacNeille also appeared as an angry anchorwoman in &quot;Elvira, Mistress of the Dark&quot; and served as the voice of Elvira&#x27;s Great-Aunt Morganna Talbot. She provided voice acting for the 2003 Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner short feature &quot;The Whizzard of Ow&quot;.

<text>Marcia Karen Wallace (November 1, 1942 – October 25, 2013) was an American actress and comedian, primarily known for her roles on sitcoms. She is best known for her roles as receptionist Carol Kester on the 1970s sitcom &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;, Mrs. Carruthers on &quot;Full House&quot;, and as the voice of elementary school teacher Edna Krabappel on the animated series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, for which she won an Emmy in 1992. The character was retired after her death but sporadically appears through archive recording.

Wallace was known for her tall frame, red hair, and distinctive laugh. She had a career spanning five decades on TV, film, and stage. She was a frequent guest on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, which led to her receiving a personal request to appear on &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; in a role created especially for her. Diagnosed with breast cancer in 1985, she became a cancer activist, and remained so throughout her life.

==Early life==
Wallace was born in Creston, Iowa, on November 1, 1942, the eldest of three children of Arthur &quot;Poke&quot; Wallace and wife Joann. Her father owned and operated Wallace Sundries, a general merchandise store in the typical small rural country Iowa town, where Marcia, her sister Sharon, and brother Jim would often help. While Wallace was in the local high school, a teacher encouraged her to consider a career in acting after she did well in a school play. Following her 1960 graduation from Creston High School, Wallace attended nearby Parsons College in Fairfield, Iowa, which had offered her a full scholarship. She was a member of the Delta Nu chapter of Delta Zeta sorority. At Parsons, she majored in English and Theater, graduating in 1964, and performing in several campus productions, including &quot;Brigadoon&quot; and &quot;The Music Man&quot;.

==Career==
On the day she graduated from college at Parsons, Wallace moved from Iowa to New York with $148 in her pocket. To make ends meet, she typed scripts, performed in summer stock local theatre, did commercials, and worked as a substitute English teacher in The Bronx in the late 1960s. After performing for a year in a New York City / Greenwich Village nightclub, Wallace and four fellow entertainer friends formed an improvisational group called The Fourth Wall. In 1968, Wallace appeared for a year off-Broadway with the group. Afterwards, she made several other appearances in improvisational shows, and, after losing from her previous weight of 230, appeared in a nude production of &quot;Dark of the Moon&quot; at the avant-garde Mercer Arts Center in Greenwich Village (now known as The Kitchen - a performing arts institution relocated to the West Village area of Manhattan).
Wallace was a semiregular on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; long-running syndicated daytime talk / variety show, appearing over 75 times. When the show moved its production from New York to Los Angeles, Wallace moved with it at Griffin&#x27;s request. One of these appearances in March 1972 led to a phone call from TV producer Grant Tinker (husband of comedic actress and fellow producer Mary Tyler Moore), who offered her a supporting role on their new &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; on the recommendation of CBS-TV founder and longtime chairman William S. (&quot;Bill&quot;) Paley. The role of &quot;Carol Kester&quot; (later &quot;Carol Kester Bondurant&quot;), the sarcastic and eccentric office receptionist to &quot;Dr. Robert Hartley&quot;, Bob Newhart&#x27;s central character, was written specifically for her. Newhart and Wallace later reprised their roles from &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; to guest roles on &quot;Anything but Cured&quot;, an episode of &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; (starring Candice Bergen).

When &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; ended its six-season run in 1978, Wallace began three decades of television appearances on various game shows, including &quot;Match Game&quot;; &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;; &quot;Password Plus and Super Password&quot;; &quot;Celebrity Whew!&quot;; &quot;Crosswits&quot;; &quot;Hot Potato&quot;; &quot;Body Language&quot;; &quot;The $25,000 Pyramid&quot;; &quot;Double Talk&quot;; &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot;; &quot;Tattletales&quot;; &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;; and &quot;Acting Crazy&quot;. She was also on special celebrity episodes of the Ray Combs version of &quot;Family Feud&quot; and the Jim Perry version of &quot;Card Sharks&quot;. In April 2008, she appeared on the interactive show &quot;GSN Live&quot; on the cable TV channel Game Show Network (GSN).

Other brief television roles include: as Darrin&#x27;s secretary in &quot;Laugh, Clown, Laugh&quot;, a &quot;Bewitched&quot; episode in 1971; two appearances on &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; (once as Marcia&#x27;s teacher in &quot;Getting Davy Jones&quot; and once as the woman who sells Jan a mod wig in &quot;Will the Real Jan Brady Please Stand Up?&quot;); as school principal Mrs. Lyman in two episodes of &quot;ALF&quot;; and as Mrs. Carruthers in a few episodes of &quot;Full House&quot;. Wallace also had guest appearances on programs &quot;Charles in Charge&quot;; &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;; &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;; &quot;Columbo&quot;; and &quot;A Different World&quot;. On one of the last episodes of &quot;Taxi&quot;, she portrayed herself, chosen as the ideal date of Rev. Jim Ignatowski. Later, Wallace played the maid on the satirical series &quot;That&#x27;s My Bush!&quot;, and, in 2009, appeared on the daytime soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, playing Annie Wilkes, an inefficient assistant kidnapper.

After &quot;The Simpsons&quot; animated series started in 1989, Wallace joined the voice acting cast as the voice of Edna Krabappel, whom she played until her death in 2013. In 1992, she received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for the episode &quot;Bart the Lover&quot; on The Simpsons.

On film, Wallace appeared in such features as &quot;My Mom&#x27;s a Werewolf&quot;, &quot;Teen Witch&quot;, and &quot;Ghoulies III: Ghoulies Go to College&quot;. In the 2008 film &quot;Tru Loved&quot;, she played a high school drama teacher who sponsors a gay–straight alliance.

Wallace&#x27;s work onstage included &quot;An Almost Perfect Person&quot; in Los Angeles which she also produced; a tour of the female version of Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;; &quot;Same Time, Next Year&quot;; &quot;Twigs&quot;; &quot;It Had to Be You&quot;; &quot;Supporting Cast&quot;; &quot;Prisoner of Second Avenue&quot;; and &quot;Plaza Suite&quot;. Wallace made her musical stage debut in the August 1983 California Musical Theatre&#x27;s Sacramento Music Circus production of &quot;&quot; in Sacramento. She returned the following season in the musical &quot;Promises, Promises&quot;. Other stage productions included &quot;Born Yesterday&quot;; &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot;; &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot;; and &quot;Last of the Red Hot Lovers&quot;, in which she played all three female roles at various times. She performed in &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; production in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and San Diego. In 2013, shortly before her death, she voiced the character of the librarian in &quot;Monsters University&quot;, and in 2014 (posthumously) she portrayed herself in the movie &quot;Muffin Top: A Love Story&quot;.

==Personal life==
Wallace married hotelier Dennis Hawley on May 18, 1986, in a Buddhist ceremony. The couple adopted an infant son, Michael Wallace &quot;Mikey&quot; Hawley. Dennis died from pancreatic cancer in June 1992.

Before her marriage, Wallace was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1985, after which she became an activist and lecturer on the subject. On January 27, 2007, Wallace won the &quot;Gilda Radner Courage Award&quot;. It was annually given by the longtime nationally prominent institution in the medical fight against the disease of cancer, the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, New York. It was given to her six years before her death for helping educate Americans about the importance of early cancer detection and inspiring others through her 20 years as a breast cancer survivor.

Wallace was a member of Delta Zeta sorority from her college years at Parsons College in Iowa, and was named the &quot;Delta Zeta 2010 Woman of the Year&quot; at their 2010 Biennial National Convention in Tucson, Arizona. Her autobiography, titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back, We&#x27;re Not Going That Way&quot;, was published in 2004. Besides describing her film and TV career, the book importantly recounts the early detection of her breast cancer, the early loss of her husband Dennis, her nervous breakdown, her single motherhood, and other personal experiences such as a private history of bulimia. She credited the title of the book to her father, who used the phrase often during her childhood.

She was noted on a list of &quot;Famous Iowans&quot; by her important state capital daily newspaper, the &quot;Des Moines Register&quot;, in November 2013.

==Illness, death and funeral==
Wallace died from pneumonia and sepsis on October 25, 2013, at age 70. Breast cancer was also listed as a significant condition on her death certificate. Wallace was cremated following a private funeral service.
Staff on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; had reportedly been aware of her ill health. Showrunner Al Jean said, &quot;I was tremendously saddened to learn this morning of the passing of the brilliant and gracious Marcia Wallace.&quot; Yeardley Smith, who voices Lisa Simpson, tweeted, &quot;Heaven is now a much funnier place b/c of you, Marcia.&quot; Former co-star Bob Newhart commented on his Facebook fan page, &quot;Marcia&#x27;s death came as quite a shock, she left us too early. She was a talented actress and dear friend[.]&quot; Al Jean said that producers planned to retire her &quot;irreplaceable&quot; character Edna Krabappel. The &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Four Regrettings and a Funeral&quot; was shown on November 3, 2013, and dedicated to her. Wallace had recorded lines for several upcoming episodes, and her final episode, &quot;The Man Who Grew Too Much&quot;, aired on March 9, 2014.
In February 2021, it was announced that archival recordings of Marcia Wallace&#x27;s voice that she provided as Edna Krabappel would be making a final appearance on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. The character is mentioned in a chalkboard gag and shown in flashback scenes in the show&#x27;s 696th episode, entitled &quot;Diary Queen&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Variety&quot; regarding the announcement, Al Jean remarked, &quot;We never got the chance to give sort of a proper goodbye to her in the show, and this is a small attempt to do that.&quot;

<text>Dr. Israel Shahak (; born Israel Himmelstaub, 28 April 1933 – 2 July 2001) was an Israeli professor of organic chemistry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, a Holocaust survivor, an intellectual of liberal political bent, and a civil-rights advocate and activist on behalf of both Jews and Gentiles (non-Jews). For twenty years, he headed the Israeli League for Human and Civil Rights (1970–90) and was a public critic of the policies of the governments of Israel. As a public intellectual, Shahak&#x27;s works about Judaism proved controversial, especially the book &quot;Jewish History, Jewish Religion: The Weight of Three Thousand Years&quot; (1994).

==Biography==
Israel Shahak was born Israel Himmelstaub, in 1933, in Warsaw, Poland, and was the youngest child of a cultured, Zionist family of Ashkenazi Jews. During the Second World War, the Nazi occupation of Poland (1939–1945) interned the Shahak family to the Warsaw Ghetto; yet his elder brother escaped from Poland to the United Kingdom, where he joined the Royal Air Force. Life in occupied Poland forced Shahak&#x27;s mother to pay a Roman Catholic family to hide Israel, whom they returned when she could not afford their safe-keeping him from the Nazis.

In 1943, the Nazis sent the Shahak family to the Poniatowa concentration camp, to the west of Lublin, where his father died. Fortuitously, the ten-year-old boy and his mother escaped from the Poniatowa camp, and returned to Warsaw; yet, within a year, whilst emptying the city of Jews, the Nazis recaptured Israel and his mother, and imprisoned them in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where they survived for 2 years, until the camp and its inmates were liberated in 1945 by the British Army. At age 13, in 1946, he re-examined the idea of God&#x27;s existence and concluded that evidence for the theory was lacking. As displaced persons, mother and son managed to emigrate to the British Mandate of Palestine, where Shahak&#x27;s application to join a kibbutz was denied, because he was judged to be physically too slender.

Post-war, the twelve-year-old Israel worked and studied and supported his mother, whose health had deteriorated in Bergen-Belsen. After a religious Jewish education at boarding school in the village of Kfar Hassidim, Israel and his mother moved to the city of Tel Aviv. Upon graduation from secondary school, Shahak served in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). After the military service, he earned a doctorate in chemistry, at Hebrew University.

In the course of his professional career as a scientist, Shahak&#x27;s work in organic chemistry produced science about organic compounds of the element fluorine (F), contributed to cancer research, for which he gained an international reputation and included posting as an assistant to Ernst David Bergmann, the nuclear physicist who was chairman (1952) of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission (IAEC). In 1961, Shahak pursued post-doctoral studies at Stanford University, in the U.S.; in 1963, he returned to Israel, where he became a popular lecturer and researcher in chemistry, at Hebrew University; moreover, by 1965, Shahak actively participated in the Israeli politics of the day.

In 1990, the academic Shahak retired from the faculty of Hebrew University, because of poor health (diabetes mellitus) and greater interest in research work in other fields of intellectual enquiry. For most of his adult life, Shahak resided in the Rehavia neighborhood in West Jerusalem; at the age of 68 years, he died of diabetic complications, and was buried in the Givat Shaul cemetery.

Shahak had a deep affinity with Spinoza: he always packed a copy of The Ethics in his suitcase for reading during his periodic stints of service in the Israel Defense Forces, and had been writing a book on the philosopher before his death. His activities as a public intellectual fighting for human rights causes and for a secular state earned him a reputation for controversy, and frequent abuse. He was regularly spat on, frequently given death threats, and decried variously as an Israel basher, self-hating Jew, traitor, and enemy of the people.

==Politics==
=== Public intellectual ===
In the late 1950s, as a citizen of Israel, Shahak became politically engaged on hearing a comment of David Ben-Gurion that, with the Suez War (29 October 1956 – 7 November 1956), the State of Israel was fighting to achieve &quot;the kingdom of David and Solomon&quot;.
In the 1960s he joined the Israeli League Against Religious Coercion. In 1965, he began political activism against &quot;Classical Judaism&quot; and Zionism; and wrote a letter to &quot;Haaretz&quot; about having witnessed an Orthodox Jew &quot;refusing to let his phone be used on the Sabbath to help a non-Jew who had collapsed nearby&quot;; in Israel, Shahak&#x27;s complaint began a long-running debate about the attitudes (religious and cultural) of Orthodox Judaism towards gentiles.

In 1967, after the Six-Day War (5–10 June 1967), Shahak ended his membership to the League Against Religious Coercion, because they were &quot;fake liberals&quot; who used the principles of Liberalism to combat coercive religious influence in Israeli society — but did not apply such protections to the Israeli Palestinians living in the IDF-occupied West Bank and in the Gaza Strip. In the event, Shahak joined the Israeli League for Human and Civil Rights, and became its president in 1970. The League, composed of Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel, protested and publicized Israel&#x27;s restrictive policies against Palestinians and provided legal aid to them. Some settlers in the West Bank city of Hebron so hated him that in 1971 they had their pick-up truck painted with &quot;Dr. Shahak To The Gallows&quot;.

In 1969, Shahak and another member of the faculty of Hebrew University staged a sit-down protest against the Israeli government&#x27;s policy of jailing politically active Palestinian students, by way of administrative detention authorised by state-of-emergency laws; likewise, Shahak supported the political efforts of Palestinian students to achieve equal rights, like those granted to Jewish Israelis, at Hebrew University. In 1970, Shahak established the Committee Against Administrative Detentions to formally oppose such legalised political repression.

To make public what he considered the anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian legalised discrimination, Shahak published English translations of Hebrew-language reportage about illegal and unjust actions of the Israeli government against the gentile citizens of Israel; Shahak&#x27;s English reports were intended for the Jewish community of the U.S. The translated reports featured headlines such as &quot;Torture in Israel,&quot; and &quot;Collective Punishment in the West Bank&quot;, which Shahak sent to journalists, academics, and human rights activists, and so ensured that the mainstream population of the U.S. would be informed of the religious discrimination practised by the government of Israel.

===Civil rights advocate===
As a public intellectual, Shahak wrote about the Israeli government&#x27;s actions against the non-Jewish citizens of the State of Israel, such as the suppression of freedom of speech and general political activity; land ordinances, living restrictions, and the confiscation of lands from non-Jews; the destruction of houses; legally-sanctioned unequal pay and work restrictions; emergency-defence regulations allowing the summary arrest, detention, and torture of prisoners (civil and military); the collective punishment of communities; the assassinations of leaders (religious, political, academic); racial discrimination in access to education; and the deprivation of Israeli citizenship. Such political activities earned Shahak much hostility and death threats; after the 1982 Lebanon War (June 1982 – June 1985), Shahak also reported Israeli abuses of the populations of Lebanon.

In effort to explain the behaviour of the State of Israel towards their Arab neighbours, Shahak proposed that the Israeli interpretation of Jewish history produced a society who disregard the human rights of the Arab peoples, within Israel and around Israel. That Zionism was a &quot;régime based on structural discrimination and racism&quot;.

In the book review of a festschrift in honour of Rabbi Elmer Berger &quot;Anti-Zionism: Analytical Reflections&quot; (1988), Sheldon Richman characterized Shahak&#x27;s interpretation of Zionism as viewing it as an atavistic reaction against the European Enlightenment&#x27;s individualism that strove to revive the suffocating world of the Jewish ghetto. The founders of the movement did not believe Jews could lead a normal existence in democratic societies. In this sense, for Shahak, Zionism can be thought of as &quot;a mirror image of anti-Semitism,&quot; in that, in common with antisemites, Zionists considered Jews to be aliens who must be quarantined from the rest of the world, a viewpoint Shahak read as capitulating to European antisemitism. For Richman, Shahak&#x27;s analysis shed light on the tragic consequences that followed upon the establishment of Israel, as Arabs were swept away to forge a state for Jews alone.

In letters published in the &quot;Ha&#x27;aretz&quot; and &quot;Kol Ha&#x27;ir&quot; newspapers, Shahak criticized the political hypocrisy demonstrated by the radical Left in their uncritical support of the Palestinian nationalist movements. In his obituary of Shahak, Christopher Hitchens said that Shahak&#x27;s house was &quot;a library of information about the human rights of the oppressed&quot;, and that:

The families of prisoners, the staff of closed and censored publications, the victims of eviction and confiscation — none were ever turned away. I have met influential &quot;civil society&quot; Palestinians alive today who were protected as students when Israel was a professor of chemistry at the Hebrew University; from him they learned never to generalize about Jews. And they respected him, not just for his consistent stand against discrimination, but also because — he never condescended to them. He detested nationalism and religion, and made no secret of his contempt for the grasping Arafat entourage. But, as he once put it to me, &quot;I will now only meet with Palestinian spokesmen when we are out of the country. I have some severe criticisms to present to them. But I cannot do this while they are living under occupation, and I can &#x27;visit&#x27; them as a privileged citizen.&quot;

Shahak was also active in protesting the public burning of Christian books such as occurred on 23 March 1980 when &quot;Yad Le-akhim&quot;, a religious organization that was at the time a beneficiary of subsidies from the Ministry of Religion, ceremonially incinerated hundreds of copies of the New Testament publicly in Jerusalem.

===Author===
Among the books publish by Israel Shahak are &quot;Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel&quot; (1994), co-authored by Norton Mezvinsky, &quot;Jewish History, Jewish Religion: The Weight of Three Thousand Years&quot; (1994), and &quot;Open Secrets: Israel&#x27;s Nuclear and Foreign Policies&quot; (1997). In the introduction to the 2004 edition of &quot;Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel&quot;, the historian Mezvinsky said, &quot;We realize that, by criticizing Jewish fundamentalism, we are criticizing a part of the past that we love. We wish that members of every human grouping would criticize their own past, even before criticizing others.&quot;

==Alleged telephone incident==
In 1965, Shahak wrote a letter to the &quot;Haaretz&quot; newspaper, about an injustice he witnessed; that letter originated &quot;the current major debate within and outside Israel about Orthodox Jewish attitudes to non-Jews.&quot; In the letter, Shahak said he witnessed an Orthodox Jew refuse the use of his telephone to call for an ambulance for a non-Jew, because it was the Shabbat. Shahak added that the Beth din, the rabbinical court of Jerusalem, had confirmed that the Orthodox Jew correctly understood &quot;Halakha&quot; law on Pikuach nefesh regarding non-Jews and the Sabbath, and quoted passages from a recent legal compilation.

Consequently, the cultural matter of a religiously-denied telephone became public political discussion in the Israeli press and the Jewish press abroad, all of which directed attention to Shahak as a public intellectual in the cultural politics of Israel. &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; in London stated that &quot;The halakha (Jewish law) abounds in such abominations ... in conflict with the humane instincts within which anyone raised in Jewish tradition is imbued.&quot; In the &quot;Maariv&quot; newspaper, the minister of religious affairs, Rabbi Dr. Zerach Warhaftig said that the Orthodox rabbinical ruling was correct, but quoted traditional Jewish passages that allowed a Jewish physician to save the life of a non-Jew on the Sabbath, despite not being religiously required to do so.

===Public controversy===
In 1966, Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits disputed the veracity of Shahak&#x27;s story, claiming that Israel Shahak had been compelled to admit that the incident had not occurred. He cited a lengthy &quot;responsum&quot;, by Isser Yehuda Unterman, the Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel, who said that &quot;the Sabbath must be violated to save non-Jewish life no less than Jewish lives&quot;, and cited a ruling by Rabbi Menachem Meiri that Jews &quot;should&quot; desecrate the Sabbath to save a gentile&#x27;s life. The opinions of these rabbis derived from the book &quot;Noda B&#x27;Yehuda&quot; (&quot;Known in Judah&quot;), in which the 18th-century religious authority Yechezkel Landau said: &quot;I emphatically declare that in all laws contained in the Jewish writings concerning theft, fraud, etc. no distinction is made between Jew and Gentile; that the (Talmudic) legal categories goy, &quot;akum&quot; (idolater) etc., in no way apply to the people among whom we live.&quot;

In 1967, Ze&#x27;ev Falk, while dissociating himself from Shahak&#x27;s Sabbath story which he regarded as an invention, acknowledged that it was this &quot;fiction&quot; and method of action which had indeed brought about Rabbi Unterman&#x27;s ruling that allowed the Sabbath to be violated to save the lives of Gentiles. For him, Unterman&#x27;s ruling may have opened a &quot;new page&quot; in Orthodox Jewish attitudes to righteous Gentiles and non-Jews alike.

===The history book===
Despite the controversy, Shahak published his account of the telephone in the first chapter of &quot;Jewish History, Jewish Religion&quot; (1994), and said that &quot;neither the Israeli, nor the diaspora rabbinical authorities ever reversed their ruling that a Jew should not violate the Sabbath in order to save the life of a Gentile. They added much sanctimonious twaddle to the effect that, if the consequence of such an act puts Jews in danger, the violation of the Sabbath is permitted, for their sake.&quot;

In 2008, seven years after Shahak&#x27;s death, the controversy of religious interpretation continued when Rabbi Shmuley Boteach doubted the veracity of Shahak&#x27;s report of Jewish injustice against a non-Jew: &quot;From the beginning, the story was curious. What prohibition could there possibly be, in allowing someone else to use one&#x27;s phone on the Sabbath?&quot; In support, he cited Eli Beer, the chief coordinator of Israel&#x27;s volunteer ambulance service (1,100 medical personnel, 60 per cent Orthodox), who said, &quot;If someone would say we won&#x27;t save a non-Jewish life on the Sabbath, he is a liar. If he is Jewish, Christian, or Muslim we save everyone&#x27;s life on any day of the year, including the Sabbath and Yom Kippur, and I have done so myself. Indeed, as an Orthodox Jew it is my greatest honor to save the life of a non-Jew, and I would violate any of the Jewish holy days to do so.&quot;

==&quot;Jewish History, Jewish Religion&quot;==
In 1994, Shahak published &quot;Jewish History, Jewish Religion: The Weight of Three Thousand Years&quot;, about Jewish fundamentalism, which history professor Norton Mezvinsky, at Central Connecticut State University, said is a:

Scathing attack upon Classical Judaism and its more modern outgrowth, Orthodox Judaism... As a lover of prophetic Judaism and as a disciple of Spinoza, Shahak, in a learned and rational manner, condemned the parochialism, racism, and hatred of non-Jews, which too often appeared in the Judaism that developed during and after the Talmudic period, and which, to a goodly extent, still exists.

That the initial history of most nations is ethnocentric, and that, in time, by way of a period of critical self-analysis, the nation incorporates the social perspectives of the Other, of the ethnic groups living among them. That, after the Age of Enlightenment, the Jewish emancipation from legal and religious social subordination was a dual liberation — from Christian antisemitism and from the rabbinate of conservative Judaism, and their &quot;imposed scriptural control&quot; upon daily Jewish life.

The journalist Robert Fisk said that the examination of Jewish fundamentalism is invaluable, because Shahak concludes that:
There can no longer be any doubt that the most horrifying acts of oppression in the West Bank are motivated by Jewish religious fanaticism.&quot; He quotes from an official exhortation to religious Jewish soldiers about Gentiles, published by the Israeli army&#x27;s Central Region Command, in which the chief chaplain writes: &quot;When our forces come across civilians during a war, or in hot pursuit, or a raid, so long as there is no certainty that those civilians are incapable of harming our forces, then, according to the &quot;Halakhah&quot; (the legal system of Classical Judaism) they may and even should be killed... In no circumstances should an Arab be trusted, even if he makes an impression of being civilised... In war, when our forces storm the enemy, they are allowed, and even enjoined, by the &quot;Halakhah&quot; to kill even good civilians, that is, civilians who are ostensibly good.

In his foreword to the second edition (1997), Edward Said said that Shahak was &quot;one of the most remarkable individuals in the contemporary Middle East&quot; who he credits with doing more to dissipate the &quot;ideological smoke screen&quot; of Zionism than any other single individual. He goes on to describe Shahak as &quot;un- and anti-racist&quot; and emphasizes Shahak&#x27;s consistency in applying a single standard for infractions against human rights. Said describes Shahak&#x27;s writing as &quot;rigorous and uncompromising&quot;, often at the expense of putting things &quot;&#x27;nicely&#x27;&quot;.

Said comments specifically about &quot;Jewish History, Jewish Religion&quot; as a powerful contribution to the study of Judaism and rabbinical and Talmudic traditions and it&#x27;s associated scholarship. In summary, he describes this work:Shahak shows that the obscure, narrowly chauvinist prescriptions against various undesirable Others are to be found in Judaism (as well of course as other monotheistic traditions) but he also then goes on to show the continuity between those and the way Israel treats Palestinians, Christians and other non-Jews. A devastating portrait of prejudice, hypocrisy and religious intolerance emerges.About his other writing, Said also emphasized Shahak&#x27;s willingness to criticize Palestinian policies, addressing &quot;the PLO&#x27;s sloppiness, its ignorance of Israel, its inability to resolutely oppose Israel, its shabby compromises and cult of personality, its general lack of seriousness.&quot; 

In his book review, Werner Cohn said that Shahak was making &quot;grotesque charges&quot; and that specific passages in &quot;Jewish History, Jewish Religion&quot; are without foundation:

Some are just funny. He says (pp. 23-4) that &quot;Jewish children are actually taught&quot; to utter a ritual curse when passing a non-Jewish cemetery. He also tells us (p. 34) that &quot;both before and after a meal, a pious Jew ritually washes his hands...On one of these two occasions he is worshiping God... but on the other he is worshiping Satan...&quot; I did take the trouble to question my orthodox rabbi nephew to find what might be behind such tall tales. He had no clue. If orthodox Jews were actually taught such hateful things, surely someone would have heard. Whom is Dr. Shahak kidding?.

The remark regarding children passing a cemetery occurs in Shahak&#x27;s discussion of passages modified by rabbis who, under pressure from antisemitic Christian authorities such as those in Tzarist Russia, altered the texts, while keeping private copies of the originals which, according to Shahak were restored as the proper manuscript readings and published in Israel after the founding of the state of Israel.

Samuel Heilman writing for the &quot;Review of Middle East Studies&quot; gave a negative review and proposed to dispose the book &quot;into the same dustbin as the infamous anti-Jewish tract and fraud, the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.&quot;

==Critical reception==
As a public intellectual, Israel Shahak was accused of fabricating the incidents he reported, of blaming the victim, of distorting the normative meaning of Jewish religious texts, and of misrepresenting Jewish belief and law. Paul Bogdanor claimed that Shahak &quot;regaled his audience with a stream of outrageous libels, ludicrous fabrications, and transparent hoaxes. As each successive allegation was exposed and discredited, he would simply proceed to a new invention.&quot; Ari Alexander, co-founder of the Children of Abraham Organization for Jewish–Islamic dialogue, said that, despite the use of Shahak&#x27;s works by neo-Nazis and anti-Israel organisations in Arab countries:

The texts that Shahak cites are real (though Shahak&#x27;s sporadic use of footnotes makes it difficult to check all of them). Often, the interpretation [by Shahak] of these texts is debatable, and their prominence in Judaism negligible, but, nonetheless, they are part of Jewish tradition, and, therefore, cannot be ignored.

Accusations of being an antisemite were among the responses to Shahak&#x27;s works about Judaism and the Talmud. In that vein, in &quot;The Talmud in Anti-Semitic Polemics&quot;, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) listed Shahak as one of four authors of antisemitic polemics, and Bogdanor said that in his works, Shahak was &quot;recycling Soviet anti-Semitic propaganda&quot;. Werner Cohn said, &quot;without question, he is the world&#x27;s most conspicuous Jewish anti-Semite... Like the Nazis before him, Shahak specialized in defaming the Talmud. In fact, he has made it his life&#x27;s work to popularize the anti–Talmud ruminations of the eighteenth-century German anti-Semite, Johann Eisenmenger&quot;. Emanuele Ottolenghi, reviewing Alexander and Bogdanor&#x27;s book, argued that Jews such as Shahak, George Steiner, Tanya Reinhart, Tony Judt, Avi Shlaim, Seymour Hersh and Daniel Boyarin act as enablers for antisemites, because the rhetoric of antisemitic Jews plays a &quot;crucial role... in excusing, condoning, and — in effect — abetting anti-Semitism.&quot; In his opinion, &quot;Anti-Semites rely on Jews to confirm their prejudice: If Jews recur to such language, and advocate such policies, how can anyone be accused of anti-Semitism, for making the same arguments?... The mechanism through which an anti-Semitic accusation becomes respectable once a Jew endorses it is not limited to Israel&#x27;s new historians... Israel Shahak made the comparison between Israel and Nazism respectable — all the while describing Judaism according to the medieval canons of the blood libel&quot;.

The journalist Dan Rickman argues that

Shahak ignores [the dialectical nature and humanist] aspects of the sources. Further, through overstating his case, his analysis fits into anti-Semitic traditions of such accusations against the Talmud. Copies of the Talmud have been burned, and the text of the Talmud that is studied today is still heavily censored. Shahak&#x27;s view that chauvinism in these sources in any way &#x27;justifies&#x27; anti-Semitism is also very troubling. However, I do believe that his trenchant critique of Judaism is, tragically, not without some force. The contemporary situation is that we do see some modern Orthodox rabbis utilise xenophobic sources in modern rulings. Orthodox rabbis in organisations such as Rabbis for Human Rights are sadly the exception rather than the rule.

==Death==
Shahak died of diabetes in July 2001 and was buried in Giv&#x27;at Shaul cemetery, Jerusalem. His death was the occasion of tribute and criticism; the Bar-Ilan University historian Haim Genizi, said that &quot;Shahak&#x27;s extreme anti-Israeli statements were welcomed by the PLO, and [were] widely circulated in pro–Arab circles&quot;, in detriment to the interests of the State of Israel. Gore Vidal said Shahak was &quot;the latest, if not the last, of the great prophets&quot;, regarding the influence of religion upon the civil law of society. Norton Mezvinsky, said that his friend and collaborator was &quot;a rare intellectual giant and a superior humanist&quot;; in that vein, Edward Said said that Shahak was &quot;a very brave man who should be honored for his services to humanity.&quot; An obituary in &quot;Haaretz&quot; called him &quot;the scourge of nationalists&quot;.

Christopher Hitchens considered Shahak a &quot;dear friend and comrade... [who was] a brilliant and devoted student of the archaeology of Jerusalem and Palestine&quot;, who, &quot;during his chairmanship of the Israeli League for Human and Civil Rights, set a personal example that would be very difficult to emulate.&quot; Alexander Cockburn, writing in Antiwar.com, described Shahak the intellectual, the &quot;tireless translator and erudite foot-noter... a singular man, an original.&quot; Allan C. Brownfeld, of the American Council for Judaism, recalled a humanist who actively opposed &quot;racism and oppression in any form and in any country&quot;; that Shahak possessed a &quot;genuinely prophetic Jewish voice, one which ardently advocated democracy and human rights.&quot; In an obituary, the journalist Elfi Pallis called Shahak essentially &quot;an old-fashioned liberal&quot; in principle, thought, and action. Moreover, Michel Warschawski said that Israel Shahak was &quot;the last Israeli liberal&quot;, who was &quot;above all, one of the last philosophers of the eighteenth-century school of enlightenment, rationalism, and liberalism, in the American meaning of the concept.&quot;

<text>The Xianbei (; ) were an ancient nomadic people that once resided in the eastern Eurasian steppes in what is today Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, and Northeastern China. The Xianbei were likely not of a single ethnicity, but rather a multilingual, multi-ethnic confederation consisting of mainly Proto-Mongols (who spoke either pre-Proto-Mongolic, or Para-Mongolic languages), and, to a minor degree, Tungusic and Turkic peoples. They originated from the Donghu people who splintered into the Wuhuan and Xianbei when they were defeated by the Xiongnu at the end of the third century BC. Following the split, the Xianbei people did not have a direct contact with the Han dynasty, residing to the north of the Wuhuan. In the first century BC, the Xianbei began actively engaging in the struggle between the Han and Xiongnu, culminating in the Xianbei replacing the Xiongnu on the Mongolian Plateau.

In the mid-2nd century, the chieftain, Tanshihuai unified the Xianbei and waged war against the Han dynasty. His confederation threatened the Han&#x27;s northern borders for many years, but quickly disintegrated following his death in 181 AD. After suffering several defeats by the end of the Three Kingdoms period, the Xianbei migrated south and settled in close proximity to Han society and submitted as vassals to the Chinese dynasties. As one of the so-called &quot;Five Barbarians&quot; that settled in northern China, the Xianbei fought as auxiliaries for the Western Jin dynasty during the War of the Eight Princes and the Upheaval of the Five Barbarians before eventually distancing themselves and declaring their autonomy as the Jin was pushed to the south. During the Sixteen Kingdoms period, the Xianbei founded several short-lived states in the north and established themselves on the Central Plains.

The Xianbei were at one point all subjected to the Di-led Former Qin dynasty before it fell apart not long after its defeat in the Battle of Fei River by the Eastern Jin. In the wake of the Former Qin&#x27;s collapse, the Tuoba formed the Northern Wei dynasty and eventually reunited northern China, ushering China into the Northern and Southern dynasties period. The Northern dynasties, all of which were either led or heavily influenced by the Xianbei, opposed and promoted sinicization at one point or another but trended towards the latter and had merged with the general Chinese population by the Tang dynasty. The Northern Wei also arranged for ethnic Han elites to marry daughters of the Tuoba imperial clan in the 480s. More than fifty percent of Tuoba Xianbei princesses of the Northern Wei were married to southern Han men from the imperial families and aristocrats from southern China of the Southern dynasties who defected and moved north to join the Northern Wei.

==Etymology==
Paul Pelliot tentatively reconstructs the Eastern Han Chinese pronunciation of 鮮卑 as */serbi/, from *Särpi, after noting that Chinese scribes used 鮮 to transcribe Middle Persian sēr (lion) and 卑 to transcribe foreign syllable /pi/; for instance, Sanskrit गोपी &quot;gopī&quot; &quot;milkmaid, cowherdess&quot; became Middle Chinese 瞿卑 (&quot;ɡɨo-piᴇ&quot;) (&gt; Mand. &quot;qúbēi&quot;).
According to Schuessler, however, the Eastern Han Chinese pronunciation of 鮮卑 is /sian pie/, and he does not reconstruct syllables ending in &quot;-r&quot; for this stage. He reconstructed the Later Han pronunciation of 室韋 as /śit wui/.

On the one hand, *Särpi may be linked to the Mongolic root &quot;*ser&quot; ~&quot;*sir&quot; which means &quot;crest, bristle, sticking out, projecting, etc.&quot; (cf. Khalkha сэрвэн &quot;serven&quot;), possibly referring to the Xianbei&#x27;s horses (semantically analogous with the Turkic ethnonym &quot;Yabaqu&quot; &lt; &quot;Yapağu&quot; &#x27;matted hair or wool&#x27;, later &#x27;a matted-haired animal, i.e. a colt&#x27;) On the other hand, the &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; and the &quot;Book of Wei&quot; stated that before becoming an ethnonym, Xianbei had been a toponym, referring to the Great Xianbei mountains (大鮮卑山), which is now identified as the Greater Khingan range ().

Shimunek (2018) reconstructs *&quot;serbi&quot; for Xiānbēi and *&quot;širwi&quot; for 室韋 Shìwéi &lt; MC &quot;*ɕiɪt̚-ɦʉi&quot;.

==History==
===Origin===
Warring States period&#x27;s Chinese literature contains early mentions of Xianbei, as in the poem &quot;The Great Summons&quot; () in the anthology Verses of Chu and possibly the chapter &quot;Discourses of Jin 8&quot; in Discourses of the States.

When the Donghu &quot;Eastern Barbarians&quot; were defeated by Modu Chanyu around 208 BC, the Donghu splintered into the Xianbei and Wuhuan. According to the &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot;, &quot;the language and culture of the Xianbei are the same as the Wuhuan&quot;.

The first significant contact the Xianbei had with the Han dynasty was in 41 and 45, when they joined the Wuhuan and Xiongnu in raiding Han territory.

In 49, the governor Ji Tong convinced the Xianbei chieftain Pianhe to turn on the Xiongnu with rewards for each Xiongnu head they collected. In 54, Yuchouben and Mantou of the Xianbei paid tribute to Emperor Guangwu of Han.

In 58, the Xianbei chieftain Pianhe attacked and killed Xinzhiben, a Wuhuan leader causing trouble in Yuyang Commandery.

In 85, the Xianbei secured an alliance with the Dingling and Southern Xiongnu.

In 87, the Xianbei attacked the Xiongnu chanyu Youliu and killed him. They flayed him and his followers and took the skins back as trophies.

In 93, as the Northern Xiongnu were forced to the northwest by the Han dynasty, the Xianbei began occupying the Mongolian Plateau, absorbing 100,000 Xiongnu tribes and increasing their strength.

In 109, the Wuhuan and Xianbei attacked Wuyuan Commandery and defeated local Han forces. The Southern Xiongnu chanyu Wanshishizhudi rebelled against the Han and attacked the Emissary Geng Chong but failed to oust him. Han forces under Geng Kui retaliated and defeated a force of 3,000 Xiongnu but could not take the Southern Xiongnu capital due to disease among the horses of their Xianbei allies.

The Xianbei under Qizhijian raided Han territory four times from 121 to 138. In 145, the Xianbei raided Dai Commandery.

===Xianbei Confederation===

Around the mid-2nd century, a chieftain, Tanshihuai, unified the Xianbei tribes and established an imperial court at Mount Danhan (彈汗山; in present-day Shangdu County, Inner Mongolia). Under Tanshihuai, the Xianbei attacked the Wusun in the west and repelled the Dingling from the north and Buyeo from the east. He divided the Xianbei empire into three sections, each governed by an appointed chieftain.Throughout his reign, Tanshihuai aggressively raided the Han dynasty&#x27;s northern borders, with his first recorded raid being in 156. In 166, he even allied with the Southern Xiongnu and Wuhuan to attack Shaanxi and Gansu. These raids devastated the border commanderies and claimed many lives. Though the Han was able to repel them at times, they were concerned that they would not be able to subdue Tanshihuai. The Han attempted to appease him by offering him the title of King, but Tanshihuai rejected them and continued to harass their borders.

In 177, Xia Yu, Tian Yan and the Southern Xiongnu Chanyu, Tute Ruoshi Zhujiu led a force of 30,000 against the Xianbei. They were defeated and returned with only one-tenth of their original forces. A memorial made that year records that the Xianbei had taken all the lands previously held by the Xiongnu and their warriors numbered 100,000. Han deserters who sought refuge in their lands served as their advisers and refined metals as well as wrought iron came into their possession. Their weapons were sharper and their horses faster than those of the Xiongnu. Another memorial submitted in 185 states that the Xianbei were making raids on Han settlements nearly every year.

Despite the constant raids, the loose Xianbei confederacy lacked the organization of the Xiongnu empire, and they were struggling to sustain their growing population. Tanshihuai died in 181 and was succeeded by his son, Helian, but he lacked his father&#x27;s abilities and was killed in a raid on Beidi during the last years of Emperor Ling of Han. Helian&#x27;s son, Qianman was too young at the time of his father&#x27;s death, so the chieftains elected his nephew, Kuitou, to succeed him. Once Qianman came of age, however, he challenged his cousin to succession, destroying the last vestiges of unity among the Xianbei.
===Three Kingdoms===

By the Jian&#x27;an era (196–220), the Xianbei had split into many different groups, most notably with Kuitou ruling in Inner Mongolia, Kebineng in northern Shanxi, and Suli and Mijia in northern Liaodong. Following his death, Kuitou&#x27;s brothers Budugen and Fuluohan succeeded him. After Cao Cao defeated the Wuhuan at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain in 207, Budugen, Fuluohan, Kebineng and others paid tribute to him. In 218, Fuluohan met with the Wuhuan chieftain Nengchendi to form an alliance, but Nengchendi double crossed him and called in Kebineng, who killed Fuluohan. Budugen went to the court of Cao Wei in 224 to ask for assistance against Kebineng, but he eventually betrayed them and allied with Kebineng in 233. Kebineng killed Budugen soon afterwards.

Kebineng was from a minor Xianbei tribe. He rose to power west of Dai Commandery by taking in a number of Chinese refugees, who helped him drill his soldiers and make weapons. After the defeat of the Wuhuan in 207, he also sent tribute to Cao Cao, and even provided assistance against the rebel Tian Yin. In 218 he allied himself to the Wuhuan rebel Nengchendi but they were heavily defeated and forced back across the frontier by Cao Zhang. In 220, he acknowledged Cao Pi as emperor of Cao Wei. Eventually, he turned on the Wei for frustrating his advances on Suli. Kebineng conducted raids on Cao Wei before he was killed in 235, after which his confederacy disintegrated.

Many of the Xianbei tribes migrated south and settled on the borders of the Wei-Jin dynasties, where they often offered their submission. In 258, the Tuoba tribe settled in the abandoned city of Shengle, north of the Yin Mountains. To the east of them, the Yuwen tribe settled between the Luan River and Liucheng, while the Murong tribe were allowed to move deeper into Liaodong. The Duan tribe was founded in Liaoxi within the Great Wall by a Xianbei ex-slave along with a group of exiles. In the west, an offshoot of the Murong moved into northern Qinghai and mixed with the native Qiang people, becoming Tuyuhun. The Qifu tribe settled near the Longxi basin, while a branch of the Tuoba, the Tufa tribe, roamed the Hexi corridor. In 270, the Tufa chieftain, Tufa Shujineng, led the various ethnic tribes in the northwest in a rebellion against the Jin dynasty in Qin and Liang provinces but was defeated in 279 by Ma Long.

===Sixteen Kingdoms and Northern Wei===

During the War of the Eight Princes, the Xianbei of the northeast, primarily the Duan, were brought in to fight in the civil wars of the Jin princes and played a deciding factor in the wars. When the Xiongnu in Shanxi rebelled and founded the Han-Zhao dynasty, the Tuoba offered their assistance to Jin to fight the rebels. The Jin were heavily reliant on the Xianbei&#x27;s military force as they gradually lost the north during the upheaval of the Five Barbarians. For their services, the Duan and Tuoba were granted the duchies of Liaoxi and Dai, respectively. However, for varying reasons, most of the Xianbei eventually withdrew from the conflict, allowing the remnants of Jin to be quickly overwhelmed. Mass number of Chinese officers, soldiers and civilians fled south to join the Eastern Jin or north to join the Xianbei duchies.

The Xianbei founded several of the Sixteen Kingdoms in northern China. The Murong of Liaodong were the most notable clan of this period. Having adopted the Jin governing system and customs, they rose to prominence during the fall of Western Jin by providing refuge and cooperating closely with the Chinese exiles, eventually establishing Xianbei rule over the Central Plains after they defeated the Ran Wei in 352. They founded the Former Yan (337–370), Later Yan (384–407) and Southern Yan (398–410), as well as the Western Yan (384–394; not listed among the Sixteen Kingdoms). The Murong dominated the northeast and at one point vied to unify China, but fell short due to family infighting, corruption and weak rulers. Meanwhile, in Gansu, the Qifu established the Western Qin (385–431) while the Tufa established the Southern Liang (397–414).

The Tuoba retained their fiefdom of Dai (310–376), which was elevated to a kingdom in 315, before they were eventually conquered by the Di-led Former Qin dynasty. With the fall of Dai, northern China was briefly unified under the Qin, but as they rapidly collapsed following a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Fei River in 383, the Tuoba restored their state as the Northern Wei dynasty (386–535), becoming the first of the Northern dynasties (386–581). The Northern Wei grew in power after they defeated and supplanted the Later Yan on the Central Plains. In 439, they conquered the last of the Sixteen Kingdoms, thereby unifying the north and completing the transition into the Northern and Southern dynasties period.

===Sinicization and assimilation===
The Northern Wei unification was long-lasting and brought a period of relative peace to the north in the wake of the chaotic Sixteen Kingdoms period. The Xianbei had naturally been in the process of sinicization since they first entered the Chinese interior, but this process became systemic during the late Northern Wei period. Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei established a policy of systematic sinicization that was continued by his successors and largely abandoned Xianbei traditions. The royal family took sinicization a step further by decreeing the change of Xianbei names to Han names, even changing their own family name from Tuoba to Yuan. Xiaowen also moved the capital to Luoyang in the Chinese heartlands away from Pingcheng near the northern frontiers. While the population in Luoyang were open to accepting the policies, the population near the old capital were more conservative and held on to their Xianbei culture.

Marriages to Han elite families were encouraged, and the Northern Wei started to arrange for Han Chinese elites to marry daughters of the Xianbei Tuoba royal family in the 480s. More than fifty percent of Tuoba Xianbei princesses of the Northern Wei were married to southern Han Chinese men from the imperial families and aristocrats from southern China of the Southern dynasties who defected and moved north to join the Northern Wei. Some Han Chinese exiled royalty fled from southern China and defected to the Xianbei. Several daughters of the Xianbei Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei were married to Han Chinese elites, the Liu Song royal Liu Hui (劉輝), married Princess Lanling (蘭陵公主) of the Northern Wei, Princess Huayang (華陽公主) to Sima Fei (司馬朏), a descendant of Jin dynasty (266–420) royalty, Princess Jinan (濟南公主) to Lu Daoqian (盧道虔), Princess Nanyang (南陽長公主) to Xiao Baoyin (蕭寶寅), a member of Southern Qi royalty. Emperor Xiaozhuang of Northern Wei&#x27;s sister the Shouyang Princess was wedded to the Liang dynasty ruler Emperor Wu of Liang&#x27;s son Xiao Zong (蕭綜).

After the Six Frontier Towns Rebellion and the events that followed, the Northern Wei split into Eastern Wei (534–550) and Western Wei (535–556) before becoming the Northern Qi (550–577) and Northern Zhou (557–581) respectively. The chaos allowed the Xianbei frontier nobility to enter the Central Plains and give pushback on the Wei&#x27;s sinicization policies. The Northern Qi was ruled by the Gao clan, a Xianbeified Han Chinese family who relied on the Xianbei elites and favoured their traditions. Meanwhile, the Northern Zhou was ruled by the Yuwen clan of Xianbei ethnicity. Ruling over a predominantly Chinese population, the military reforms of the Western Wei and Northern Zhou saw an attempt to revive the Xianbei warrior culture, which includes reverting the sinicized names of the Northern Wei and rewarding Han Chinese officers with Xianbei names. The Prime Minister of Northern Zhou, Yang Jian, later had these names restored back to Han names.

In 581, Yang Jian founded the Sui dynasty (581–618) and unified China in 589 after absorbing the Chen dynasty (557–589). When the Sui came to an end amidst peasant rebellions and renegade troops, his cousin, Li Yuan, founded the Tang dynasty (618–907). Both Sui and Tang were founded by families who identified with their Han Chinese lineage, and were backed by an alliance of Chinese and Xianbei nobles from the Northern Zhou who sought to protect their common interest. Through these political establishments, the Xianbei who entered China and their culture were largely merged with the Chinese, examples such as the wife of Emperor Gaozu of Tang, Duchess Dou and Emperor Taizong of Tang&#x27;s wife, Empress Zhangsun, both have Xianbei ancestries, while those who remained behind in the northern grassland evolved into tribes of the Rouran and Khitan.

In the West, the Xianbei kingdom of Tuyuhun remained independent until it was defeated by the Tibetan Empire in 670. After the fall of the kingdom, the Xianbei people underwent a diaspora over a vast territory that stretched from the northwest into central and eastern parts of China. Murong Nuohebo led the Tuyuhun people eastward into central China, where they settled in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia.

== Culture ==
The economic base of the Xianbei was animal husbandry combined with agricultural practice. They were the first to develop the khanate system, in which formation of social classes deepened, and developments also occurred in their literacy, arts and culture. They used a zodiac calendar and favoured song and music. Tengrism and subsequently Buddhism were the main religions among the Xianbei people. After they abandoned the frigid north and migrated into Northern China, they gradually abandoned nomadic lifestyle and were sinicized and assimilated with the Han Chinese. Emperor Xiaowen of the Xianbei-led state of Northern Wei in northern China, eventually decreed the changes of Xianbei names to Han names. Prior to Tanshihuai, the Xianbei did not have a hereditary system, and their chieftains were chosen by electing a member of their tribe based on their character and abilities. Even as they established their states on the Central Plains and adopted the Chinese hereditary system, influential brothers, uncles and cousins of the Xianbei rulers often posed as rival claimants to the throne.

==Art==
Art of the Xianbei portrayed their nomadic lifestyle and consisted primarily of metalwork and figurines. The style and subjects of Xianbei art were influenced by a variety of influences, and ultimately, the Xianbei were known for emphasizing unique nomadic motifs in artistic advancements such as leaf headdresses, crouching and geometricized animals depictions, animal pendant necklaces, and metal openwork.

===Leaf headdresses===
The leaf headdresses were very characteristic of Xianbei culture, and they are found especially in Murong Xianbei tombs. Their corresponding ornamental style also links the Xianbei to Bactria. These gold hat ornaments represented trees and antlers and, in Chinese, they are referred to as buyao (&quot;step sway&quot;) since the thin metal leaves move when the wearer moves. Sun Guoping first uncovered this type of artifact, and defined three main styles: &quot;Blossoming Tree&quot; (huashu), which is mounted on the front of a cap near the forehead and has one or more branches with hanging leaves that are circle or droplet shaped, &quot;Blossoming Top&quot; (dinghua), which is worn on top of the head and resembles a tree or animal with many leaf pendants, and the rare &quot;Blossoming Vine&quot; (huaman), which consists of &quot;gold strips interwoven with wires with leaves.&quot; Leaf headdresses were made with hammered gold and decorated by punching out designs and hanging the leaf pendants with wire. The exact origin, use, and wear of these headdresses is still being investigated and determined. However, headdresses similar to those later also existed and were worn by women in the courts.

===Animal iconography===
Another key form of Xianbei art is animal iconography, which was implemented primarily in metalwork. The Xianbei stylistically portrayed crouching animals in geometricized, abstracted, repeated forms, and distinguished their culture and art by depicting animal predation and same-animal combat. Typically, sheep, deer, and horses were illustrated. The artifacts, usually plaques or pendants, were made from metal, and the backgrounds were decorated with openwork or mountainous landscapes, which harks back to the Xianbei nomadic lifestyle. With repeated animal imagery, an openwork background, and a rectangular frame, the included image of the three deer plaque is a paradigm of the Xianbei art style. Concave plaque backings imply that plaques were made using lost-wax casting, or raised designs were impressed on the back of hammered metal sheets.

===Horses===
The nomadic traditions of the Xianbei inspired them to portray horses in their artwork. The horse played a large role in the existence of the Xianbei as a nomadic people, and in one tomb, a horse skull lay atop Xianbei bells, buckles, ornaments, a saddle, and one gilded bronze stirrup. The Xianbei not only created art for their horses, but they also made art to depict horses. Another recurring motif was the winged horse. It has been suggested by archaeologist Su Bai that this symbol was a &quot;heavenly beast in the shape of a horse&quot; because of its prominence in Xianbei mythology. This symbol is thought to have guided an early Xianbei southern migration, and is a recurring image in many Xianbei art forms.

===Figurines===
Xianbei figurines help to portray the people of the society by representing pastimes, depicting specialized clothing, and implying various beliefs. Most figurines have been recovered from Xianbei tombs, so they are primarily military and musical figures meant to serve the deceased in afterlife processions and guard their tomb. Furthermore, the figurine clothing specifies the according social statuses: higher-ranking Xianbei wore long-sleeved robes with a straight neck shirt underneath, while lower-ranking Xianbei wore trousers and belted tunics.

===Buddhist influences===
Xianbei Buddhist influences were derived from interactions with Han culture. The Han bureaucrats initially helped the Xianbei run their state, but eventually the Xianbei became Sinophiles and promoted Buddhism. The beginning of this conversion is evidenced by the Buddha imagery that emerges in Xianbei art. For instance, the included Buddha imprinted leaf headdress perfectly represents the Xianbei conversion and Buddhist synthesis since it combines both the traditional nomadic Xianbei leaf headdress with the new imagery of Buddha. This Xianbei religious conversion continued to develop in the Northern Wei dynasty, and ultimately led to the creation of the Yungang Grottoes.

== Language ==

The Xianbei are thought to have spoken Mongolic or Para-Mongolic languages, with early and substantial Turkic influences, as Claus Schönig asserts:
It is also possible that the Xianbei spoke more than one language.

However, there are no remaining works written in Xianbei, which are thought to have been written using Chinese characters. Only a few words remain, such as 啊干 &#x27;elder brother&#x27;.

==Anthropology==
According to Du, et al. (2024), some historians believe that the Xianbei could have had &quot;exotic&quot; features such as high nose bridges, blond hair and thick beards. However, other scholars have suggested the appearance of the Xianbei was not dramatically different from modern East Asians. A genetic analysis of Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou revealed that he had an East Asian appearance, consistent with the hypothesis that the Xianbei were primarily of East Asian appearance.

Yellow hair in Chinese sources could have meant brown rather than blonde and described other people such as the Jie rather than the Xianbei. Historian Edward H. Schafer believes many of the Xianbei were blondes, but others such as Charles Holcombe think it is &quot;likely that the bulk of the Xianbei were not visibly very different in appearance from the general population of northeastern Asia.&quot; Chinese anthropologist Zhu Hong and Zhang Quan-chao studied Xianbei crania from several sites of Inner Mongolia and noticed that anthropological features of studied Xianbei crania show that the racial type is closely related to the modern East-Asians, and some physical characteristics of those skulls are closer to modern Mongols, Manchu and Han Chinese.

==Genetics==

A genetic study published in &quot;The FEBS Journal&quot; in October 2006 examined the mtDNA of 21 Tuoba Xianbei buried at the Qilang Mountain Cemetery in Inner Mongolia, China. The 21 samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to haplogroups O (9 samples), D (7 samples), C (5 samples), B (2 samples) and A. These haplogroups are characteristic of Northeast Asians. Among modern populations they were found to be most closely related to the Oroqen people.

A genetic study published in the Russian Journal of Genetics in April 2014 examined the mtDNA of 17 Tuoba Xianbei buried at the Shangdu Dongdajing cemetery in Inner Mongolia, China. The 17 samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to haplogroups D4 (four samples), D5 (three samples), C (five samples), A (three samples), G and B.

A genetic study published in the &quot;American Journal of Physical Anthropology&quot; in November 2007 examined 17 individuals buried at a Murong Xianbei cemetery in Lamadong, Liaoning, China ca. 300 AD. They were determined to be carriers of the maternal haplogroups J1b1, D (three samples), F1a (three samples), M, B, B5b, C (three samples) and G2a. These haplogroups are common among East Asians and some Siberians. The maternal haplogroups of the Murong Xianbei were noticeably different from those of the Huns and Tuoba Xianbei.

A genetic study published in the &quot;American Journal of Physical Anthropology&quot; in August 2018 noted that the paternal haplogroup C2b1a1b has been detected among the Xianbei and the Rouran, and was probably an important lineage among the Donghu people.

A full genome analysis published in November 2023 analyzed the genomic data of nine Xianbei individuals (ca. 200 CE to 300 CE), together with previous published Xianbei samples, covering almost the entire period of Xianbei as well as pre- and post-Xianbei periods, and found that the Xianbei displayed a homogenous population with nearly exclusive Ancient Northeast Asian ancestry. The authors further remark that these results are consistent with an Amur River region, specifically around the Greater Khingan mountain range area, origin for the ancestral Xianbei population. Early Xianbei did not display signs of admixture from surrounding groups, while later Xianbei displayed limited amounts of admixture with &quot;late Xiongnu-Sarmatian-like&quot; and Han Chinese (&quot;Yellow River farmer-like&quot;) groups. Later Xianbei in Northern China adopted an agricultural lifestyle and mixed with the local population, contributing to the genetic history of Northern China.

A 2024 study on Xianbei remains, including the remains of Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou, found them to be derived primarily from Ancient Northeast Asians at c. 62–96%, with a lower amount of admixture from Neolithic &#x27;Yellow River farmers&#x27; (associated with Han Chinese) at c. 4–32%. Western Steppe Herder ancestry was only found at low amounts or absent entirely among the different Xianbei remains (average at c. 2–7%). The analysed Xianbei remains display their closest genetic affinities to ancient Khitan and Mohe people, as well as modern-day Mongolic peoples. The amount of Ancient Northeast Asian and Yellow River farmer ancestries varied depending on geographic location, suggesting a form of heterogeneity among the ancient Xianbei. In contrast to the Xianbei, the early Turkic ruling class, the Ashina tribe, was found to be nearly entirely derived from Ancient Northeast Asians without significant Yellow River ancestry.

==Modern descendants==

Most Xianbei clans adopted Chinese family names during the Northern Wei dynasty. In particular, many were sinicized under Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei.

The Northern Wei&#x27;s Eight Noble Xianbei surnames were the Buliugu 步六孤, Helai 賀賴, Dugu , Helou 賀樓, Huniu 忽忸, Qiumu 丘穆, Gexi 紇奚, and Yuchi .

The &quot;Monguor&quot; (Tu) people in modern China may have descended from the Xianbei who were led by Tuyuhun Khan to migrate westward and establish the Tuyuhun Kingdom (284–670) in the third century and Western Xia (1038–1227) through the thirteenth century. Today they are primarily distributed in Qinghai and Gansu Province, and speak a Mongolic language.

The Xibe or &quot;Xibo&quot; people also believe they are descendants of the Xianbei, with considerable controversies that have attributed their origins to the Jurchens, the Elunchun, and the Xianbei.

Xianbei descendants among the Korean population carry surnames such as Mo 모 ( (shortened from Murong)), 석; (Revised Romanization: Seok; McCune–Reischauer: Sŏk; (shortened from Wushilan 烏石蘭)), 원 (Revised Romanization: Won; McCune–Reischauer: Wŏn; (the adopted Chinese surname of the Tuoba) and Dokgo ( (from Dugu)).

<doc id="113180" wikidata="Q15427080" url="?curid=113180" title="Pussy">
<text>Pussy () is an English noun, adjective, and—in rare instances—verb. It has several meanings, as slang, as euphemism, and as vulgarity. Most commonly, it is used as a noun with the meaning &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;coward&quot;, or &quot;weakling&quot;. In slang, it can mean &quot;vulva,&quot; or &quot;vagina&quot; and less commonly, by synecdoche, &quot;sexual intercourse with a woman&quot;. Because of its multiple senses including both innocent and vulgar connotations, &quot;pussy&quot; is often the subject of double entendre.

The etymology of the word is not clear. Several different senses of the word have different histories or origins. The earliest records of &quot;pussy&quot; are in the 19th century, meaning something fluffy.

==Etymology==
The noun &quot;pussy&quot; meaning &quot;cat&quot; comes from the Modern English word &quot;puss&quot;, a conventional name or term of address for a cat. Cognates are common to several Germanic languages, including Dutch &quot;poes&quot; and Middle Low German &quot;pūse&quot;, which are also used to call a cat. The word &quot;puss&quot; is attested in English as early as 1533. Earlier etymology is uncertain, but similar words exist in other European languages, including Lithuanian &quot;puižė&quot; and Irish &quot;puisín&quot;, both traditional calls to attract a cat.

The words &quot;puss&quot; and derived forms &quot;pussy&quot; and &quot;pusscat&quot; were extended to refer to girls or women by the seventeenth century. This sense of &quot;pussy&quot; was used to refer specifically to genitalia by the eighteenth century, and from there further extended to refer to sexual intercourse involving a woman by the twentieth century. &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third International Dictionary&quot; suggests that &quot;pussy&quot; in the sense of &quot;vulva&quot; may be connected to Old Norse &quot;pūss&quot; and Old English &quot;pusa&quot;, meaning &#x27;pocket&#x27; or &#x27;purse&#x27;.

Meanings of the verb relate to the common noun senses, including &quot;to act like a cat&quot;, &quot;to act like a coward&quot;, or &quot;to have sex with a woman&quot;. Adjective meanings are likewise related to the noun. 

=== Similar words ===
The medieval French word &quot;pucelle&quot; is not related to the English word. It is attested in Old French from the ninth century, and likely derives from Latin &quot;puella&quot; or &quot;pulla&quot; .

The homograph &quot;pussy,&quot; pronounced , means &quot;containing pus&quot;. 

&quot;Pussy&quot; is also a variant spelling of &quot;pursy&quot; or &quot;pursive&quot;, obsolete words for &#x27;fat, pot-bellied, short of breath, broken-winded, asthmatic (of a horse)&#x27;.

==Uses==

===Cat and similar===
Both in English and in German &quot;puss&quot; was used as a &quot;call-name&quot; for cats, but in English &quot;pussy&quot; was used as a synonym for the word &quot;cat&quot; in other uses as well. In addition to cats, the word was also used for rabbits and hares. In the 19th century, the meaning was extended to anything soft and furry. &quot;Pussy willow&quot;, for example, is a name applied to various species in the genus &quot;Salix&quot; with furry catkins. In thieves&#x27; cant the word &quot;pussy&quot; means a &quot;fur coat&quot;.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; gives as the first meaning of the noun: &quot;Chiefly colloq[uial]. A girl or woman exhibiting characteristics associated with a cat, esp[ecially] sweetness or amiability. Freq[uently] used as a pet name or as a term of endearment.&quot; The examples it cites from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries are not sexual. Another example, not cited by the OED, is one of the main characters of E. Nesbit&#x27;s &quot;Five Children and It&quot; - Jane, nicknamed Pussy by her siblings.

The verb &quot;pussyfoot&quot;, meaning to walk softly or to speak in an evasive or cautious manner, may come from the adjective &quot;pussy-footed&quot; &quot;having a cat-like foot&quot;, or directly from the noun &quot;pussyfoot&quot;. This word, first attested in the late nineteenth century, is related to both the &quot;cat&quot; and the &quot;woman&quot; meanings of &quot;pussy&quot;.

===Female genitalia===

In contemporary English, use of the word &quot;pussy&quot; to refer to women themselves is considered derogatory and demeaning, treating women as sexual objects. As a reference to genitals or to sexual intercourse, the word is considered vulgar slang. Studies find the word is used more commonly in conversations among men than in groups of women or mixed-gender groups, though subjects report using &quot;pussy&quot; more often than other slang terms for female genitals. There are women seeking to reclaim the word to symbolise sexual pleasure, power, and trust in their bodies (e.g. around childbirth).
Donald Trump&#x27;s use of the word to describe celebrity interactions with women (&quot;grab them by the pussy&quot;, known as the &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; tape) provoked strong reactions by media figures and politicians across the political spectrum; an image of a snarling cat with the slogan &quot;pussy grabs back&quot; became a &quot;rallying cry for female rage against Trump&quot;. Pink &quot;pussyhats&quot; (knitted caps with cat-like ears) were a notable feature of the worldwide protests held the day after Trump&#x27;s inauguration as President of the United States. The name attempts to reclaim the derogatory term and was never intended to be an anatomical representation.

Words referring to cats are used as vulgar slang for female genitals in some other European languages as well. Examples include German &quot;Muschi&quot; (literally &quot;house cat&quot;), French &quot;chatte&quot; (&quot;female cat&quot;, also used to refer to sexual intercourse), Dutch &quot;poes&quot; (&quot;puss&quot;), Portuguese &quot;rata&quot; (literally &quot;female rat&quot;), and Norwegian &quot;mus&quot; (&quot;mouse&quot;), which are also animal terms used as vulgar slang for women&#x27;s genitals.

===Weakness===

The word &quot;pussy&quot; is also used in a derogatory sense to mean cowardly, weak, or easily fatigued. The &quot;Collins Dictionary&quot; says: taboo, slang, mainly US) an ineffectual or timid person.&quot; It may refer to a male who is not considered sufficiently masculine, as in: &quot;The coach calls us pussies.&quot;

Men who are dominated by women (particularly by their partners or spouses and at one time referred to as &quot;hen-pecked&quot;; see pecking order) can be referred to as &quot;pussy-whipped&quot; (or simply &quot;whipped&quot; in slightly more polite society or media). This may be used simply to denigrate a man who is contented in a relationship. The hyphenated phrase is parsed as &quot;whipped by pussy&quot;, a manipulative relationship dynamic wherein a female deliberately or subconsciously withholds sexual intercourse to coerce the male into surrendering power in other aspects of the relationship.

==Word-play between meanings==

Pussy is one of a large number of English words that has both erotic and non-erotic meanings. Such &quot;double entendres&quot; have long been used in the creation of sexual humor. This double meaning of &quot;pussy&quot; has been used for over a hundred years by performers, including the late-19th-century vaudeville act the Barrison Sisters, who performed the notorious routine &quot;Do You Want To See My Pussy?&quot; in which they raised their skirts to reveal live kittens.

In the British comedy &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; the character Mrs. Slocombe often expressed concern for the welfare of her pussy. The &quot;double entendre&quot; made every reference to her cat seem to be a salacious and therefore humorous reference to her vulva.

In the 2002 film &quot;8 Mile&quot;, a rapper insults his rivals by including the line, &quot;How can six dicks be pussies?&quot; The line relies on double meanings of both &quot;dick&quot; (either &quot;contemptible person&quot; or &quot;male genitalia&quot;) and &quot;pussy&quot; (&quot;weak&quot; or &quot;female genitalia&quot;). Such word play presents a challenge for translators of the film.

Pussy Riot is a Russian radical feminist punk rock collective that stages illegal events in Moscow protesting President Vladimir Putin and the status of women in Russian society. Band member &quot;Kot&quot; says that she knows how the word is used in English, and that it is also used in Russian as term of endearment for little girls. These various meanings create a tension with the word &quot;riot&quot;, which the group likes.
In 2017 Planned Parenthood released a series of short videos on YouTube about female sexual health, with the overall title &quot;How to take care of your pussy&quot;. Instead of the word &quot;pussy&quot; being shown or spoken, a cat appears instead. The visuals consist mainly of cats, playing on the popularity of cat videos, with a voiceover by Sasheer Zamata. &quot;Refinery29&quot; called it &quot;a pretty genius metaphor&quot; and &quot;Metro&quot; said: &quot;If there are two things left in this world that are inherently wonderful, it&#x27;s cats and vaginas. Don&#x27;t argue. It&#x27;s true.[...] It makes sense, then, that Planned Parenthood has decided to combine the two to create a truly splendid video series.&quot; The series has been shortlisted for a Shorty Award.

<doc id="113183" wikidata="Q1803626" url="?curid=113183" title="Landmark Worldwide">
<text>Landmark Worldwide (known as Landmark Education before 2013), or simply Landmark, is an American employee-owned for-profit company that offers personal-development programs, with their most-known being the Landmark Forum. It is one of several large-group awareness training programs. 

Several sociologists and scholars of religion have classified Landmark as a &quot;new religious movement&quot; (NRM), while others have called it a &quot;self-religion,&quot; a &quot;corporate religion,&quot; and a &quot;religio-spiritual corporation&quot;. Landmark has sometimes been described a cult. Some religious experts dispute this claim, pointing out that Landmark does not meet some characteristics of cults, including being a religious organization, or having a central leader. Landmark has been criticized for the stress it puts on participants while it tries to convert them to a new worldview and for its recruitment tactics: Landmark does not use advertising, but instead pressures participants during courses to recruit relatives and friends as new customers. 

As part of the Human Potential Movement, which was centered in San Francisco, Werner Erhard created and ran the &quot;est&quot; (Erhard Seminars Training) system from 1971 to 1984, which promoted the idea that individuals are empowered when they take personal responsibility for all events in their lives, both good and bad. In 1985, Erhard modified est to be gentler and more business oriented and renamed it the Landmark Forum. In 1991, he sold the company and its concepts to some of his employees, who incorporated it as Landmark Education Corporation, which was restructured into Landmark Education LLC in 2003, and then renamed Landmark Worldwide LLC in 2013. Its subsidiary, the Vanto Group, markets and delivers training and consulting to organizations.

== History ==
In 1985, Werner Erhard (creator of the est training which ran from 1971 to 1984) renamed est to the Landmark Forum, and changed the content to be gentler and somewhat more business oriented. He promoted the idea that all events (good and bad) of an individual&#x27;s life were their own making, and that individuals would be empowered when they take personal responsibility for all events in their lives, an idea based in the Human Potential Movement. Many individuals liked this belief, whether or not it is true, or simply works as a placebo. The Landmark Forum&#x27;s niche was for people who did not have major psychological problems, but were nonetheless seeking self-improvement; these people constituted a very large part of society and were not served by the medical psychological establishment, which concentrated on those with mental illness.

In 1991, Erhard sold the intellectual property rights associated with the Forum&#x27;s concepts to some of his employees, (including his brother Harry Rosenberg who became CEO) who incorporated into &quot;Landmark Education Corporation.&quot; Landmark paid Erhard $3 million as an initial licensing fee, with additional payments over the next 18 years not to exceed $15 million. The new company offered similar courses and employed many of the same staff. The Forum was reduced in length from four days to three, and its price is about 50% of the cost of the est courses. In 2001, Rosenberg stated that Landmark had completely purchased the licenses to all of Erhard&#x27;s concepts and all divisions of the company.

In 2003, Landmark Education Corporation was re-structured into Landmark Education LLC, and in 2013 it was renamed Landmark Worldwide LLC. Landmark Worldwide states that it operates as a for-profit company, whose employees own all the shares of the corporation. The company states that it invests its surpluses &quot;into making its programs, initiatives, and services more widely available.&quot;

The company reported in 2019 that more than 2.4 million people had participated in its programs since 1991. Landmark holds seminars in approximately 125 locations in more than 21 countries. Landmark&#x27;s revenue surpassed $100 million in 2018, with profits of about $5 million. The organization has 500 employees, and about 7,500 volunteers, an unusually large number of volunteers for a &quot;for-profit&quot; company. Their use of volunteers prompted three separate investigations by the United States Department of Labor, which concluded without requiring Landmark to make any changes to their practices.

===Business consulting===
In 1993 Landmark started a subsidiary named Landmark Education Business Development (LEBD), (later renamed to the Vanto Group) which uses the Landmark methodology to provide consulting services to businesses and other organizations. LEBD became the Vanto Group in 2008.

=== Controversial marketing practices ===
Landmark does not use advertising to reach potential customers, but instead repeatedly pressures participants during their courses to recruit relatives, friends, and acquaintances as new clients. This complete reliance on word-of-mouth advertising to market its programs has been described by reporters variously as: &quot;evangelical&quot;, having &quot;a Ponzi taste,&quot; &quot;a quasi-pyramid scheme,&quot; and including a &quot;hard, hard sell.&quot; 

=== Accusations of being a cult ===
Landmark has faced accusations of being a cult. Several commentators unrelated to Landmark have stated that because it has no single central leader, is a secular (non-religious) organization, and it tries to unite (and re-unite) participants with their family and friends (rather than isolate them) that it does not meet many of the characteristics of a cult.

Landmark has threatened and pursued lawsuits against people who have called or labeled it such, including individuals (clinical psychology professor Margaret Singer), magazines (&quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Self&quot;, and &quot;Now&quot;) and organizations (Cult Awareness Network). After Singer wrote a book, &quot;Cults in Our Midst&quot;, in which she mentioned Landmark as a controversial New Age training course, Landmark sued Singer. The suit was resolved when Singer agreed to provide a sworn statement that Landmark is not a cult or sect. Singer stated that she would not recommend the group to anyone, and would not comment on whether Landmark used coercive persuasion for fear of legal recrimination from Landmark. In 1997, Landmark sued Cult Awareness Network (CAN) after they made statements alleging or implying that Landmark was a cult. That suit was resolved when CAN stated that it has no evidence that Landmark is a cult.

In 2004, it was revealed that Landmark had paid French anti-cult expert Jean-Marie Abgrall to &quot;audit&quot; them. Landmark had been listed as a cult by the Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France 1995 list of cults; displeased by their designation, they contacted Abgrall to have them removed from the list. Abgrall wrote a report on the organization arguing that they were not a cult, arguing that they were a &quot;harmless organization&quot;, though did conclude by recognizing that the group may have had some warning signs. Following his report they were removed from the list, and Abgrall was paid by Landmark from the period of 2001 to 2002. Abgrall complained in 2004 when interviewed by &quot;Le Parisien&quot; that this had only been revealed to block his involvement in the ongoing Order of the Solar Temple cult trial, and that he had no conflict of interest as he &quot;wrote an unfavorable report and paid my taxes.&quot; 

In June 2004, Landmark filed a 1 million dollar lawsuit against Rick Alan Ross&#x27;s Cult Education Institute, alleging that postings on the institute&#x27;s websites which characterized Landmark as a cultish organization that brainwashed their clients damaged Landmark&#x27;s product. In December 2005, Landmark filed to dismiss its own lawsuit with prejudice, purportedly on the grounds of a material change in case law after the publication of an opinion in another case, &quot;Donato v. Moldow&quot;, regarding the Communications Decency Act of 1996, even though Ross wanted to continue the case in order to further investigate Landmark&#x27;s educational materials and history of suing critics. Ross stated that he does not see Landmark as a cult because they have no individual leader, but he considers them harmful because subjects are harassed and intimidated, causing potentially unsafe levels of stress.

== Courses ==
Many large companies and government agencies have paid for and encouraged their employees to take Landmark&#x27;s classes.

Andrew Cherng, the founder and co-CEO of Panda Express, has said that Landmark aided his company&#x27;s success. He has strongly encouraged his employees and all managers to take Landmark&#x27;s classes. Chip Wilson, the founder of Lululemon Athletica, is a follower of Landmark&#x27;s principles, and has directed his companies to pay for employees to attend Landmark&#x27;s classes. 

Some of Landmark&#x27;s courses require participants to start a community project.

=== Landmark Forum ===
Landmark&#x27;s entry course, the Landmark Forum, is the default first course for new participants and provides the foundation of all Landmark&#x27;s other programs. The Landmark Forum takes place over three consecutive days plus an evening session (generally Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Tuesday evening.) The Forum is attended in a group varying in size between 75 and 250 people. Landmark arranges the course as a dialogue in which the Forum leader presents a series of proposals and encourages participants to take the floor to relate how those ideas apply to their own individual lives. Course leaders set up rules at the beginning of the program and Landmark strongly encourages participants not to miss any part of the program. Attendees are also urged to be &quot;coachable&quot; (open minded to the course&#x27;s concepts) and not just be observers during the course.

Various ideas are proposed for consideration and explored during the course. These include:

* There can be a big difference between the facts and events in a person&#x27;s life and the meaning, interpretation, and significance the person gives to or makes up about those events. The course proposes that people frequently conflate facts with their own interpretations of what occurred and, as a result, create self-inflicted suffering and a loss of effectiveness in their lives. 
* Meaning is a function of language, something people make up, rather than something intrinsic to life or occurrences. By articulating differently in a given context, people can alter the meaning they create and experience a greater degree of effectiveness in how they deal with events.
* In learning to perceive self-created meaning, people begin to see that assumptions they have made about who they are in life are actually shaped by limitations they have made up in response to past circumstances or events. This realization allows participants to articulate new meanings that are free of self-imposed constraints. The Forum goes on to train participants in actualizing these new possible meanings by sharing them with people in their lives. This creates a supportive social environment for achieving one&#x27;s dreams and goals. 
* The term &quot;new possibilities&quot; means something different from the common definition as something that may happen. Rather, the term refers to a here-and-now opportunity to be differently or take new action, free of constraints from the past.
* A person&#x27;s behavior is often governed by a perceived need to look good and be right, and people are often unaware of how their behaviors are shaped by these needs.
* When people have persistent complaints that are accompanied by unproductive fixed ways of being and acting,

During the course, participants are encouraged to call friends and family members with whom they feel they have unresolved tensions, and to take responsibility for their own behavior.

The evening session follows closely on the three consecutive days of the course and completes the Landmark Forum. During this final session, the participants share information about their results and bring guests to learn about the Forum.

A 2011 &quot;Time&quot; article stated that &quot;Landmark has been criticized for delving into the traumas of largely unscreened participants without having mental-health professionals on hand.&quot;

== Reception ==

=== Scholars ===

Sociologist Eileen Barker and sociologist of religion James A. Beckford both classified Landmark and its predecessor organization &quot;est&quot; as a &quot;new religious movement&quot; (NRM). Some scholars have categorized Landmark or its predecessor organizations as a &quot;self religion&quot; or a (broadly defined) new religious movement (NRM). Others question some aspects of these characterizations.

Renee Lockwood, a sociology of religion researcher at The University of Sydney described Landmark as a &quot;corporate religion&quot; and a &quot;religio-spiritual corporation&quot; because of its emphasis on teaching techniques for improvement in personal and employee productivity, which is marketed to businesses as well as government agencies. Sociologist of religion Thomas Robbins says that Landmark could be considered an NRM. George Chryssides, a researcher on NRMs and cults said: &quot;&quot;est&quot; and Landmark may have some of the attributes typically associated with religion, but it is doubtful whether they should be accorded full status as religious organizations.&quot; 

Stephen A. Kent, professor of Sociology and an expert in new religious movements, stated in 2014 that Landmark&#x27;s business is &quot;to teach people that the values they have held up until now have held them back; that indeed they need a new set of values and this group [Landmark] can provide those new sets of values ... I don&#x27;t know of any academic research that verifies that kind of perspective&quot; and while some individuals feel &quot;cleansed&quot; or &quot;invigorated&quot; by Landmark&#x27;s training, others may feel violated by the pressure put on them to reveal their innermost secrets to strangers during Landmark&#x27;s training sessions.

Landmark maintains that it is an educational foundation and denies being a religious movement.

====Large Group Awareness Training study====
In 1985, a group of psychology researchers studied participants of the Forum, (a Large Group Awareness Training course) and compared their outcomes to a control group of non attendees. They published their results in the book &quot;Evaluating a Large Group Awareness Training&quot;. They found that participants had a short-term increase in internal locus of control (the belief that one can control their life), but found no long-term positive or negative effects on individuals&#x27; self-perception.

=== Media ===
&quot;Time&quot; reporter Nathan Thornburgh, in his review of The Landmark Forum, said &quot;At its heart, the course was a withering series of scripted reality checks meant to show us how we have created nearly everything we see as a problem&quot; and &quot;I benefited tremendously from the uncomfortable mirror the course had put in front of me.&quot;

Reporter Laura McClure with &quot;Mother Jones&quot; attended a three and a half-day forum, which she described as &quot;My lost weekend with the trademark happy, bathroom-break hating, slightly spooky inheritors of est.&quot; Heidi Beedle, writing for the &quot;Colorado Springs Independent&quot; in 2019 said that &quot;The tangible benefits of Landmark&#x27;s courses may seem hard to pin down&quot; though community projects do seem to be one, and &quot;One thing is certain: Landmark is a program that is incredibly successful at making people feel good about Landmark.&quot;
In 2004, the French channel France 3 aired a television documentary on Landmark in their investigative series &quot;Pièces à Conviction&quot;. The episode, called &quot;Voyage Au Pays des Nouveaux Gourous&quot; (&quot;Journey to the land of the new gurus&quot;) was highly critical of its subject. Shot in large part with a hidden camera, it showed attendance at a Landmark course and a visit to Landmark offices. In addition, the program included interviews with former course participants, anti-cultists, and commentators. Landmark left France following the airing of the episode and a subsequent site visit by labor inspectors that noted the activities of volunteers, 
and sued Jean-Pierre Brard in 2004 following his appearance in the documentary.

The episode was uploaded to a variety of websites, and in October 2006 Landmark issued subpoenas pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to Google Video, YouTube, and the Internet Archive demanding details of the identity of the person(s) who had uploaded those copies. These organizations challenged the subpoenas and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) became involved, planning to file a motion to quash Landmark&#x27;s DMCA subpoena to Google Video. Landmark eventually withdrew its subpoenas.

==In popular culture==

In &quot;The Plan,&quot; the third episode of the second season of the American drama television series &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, est and The Forum are parodied.

<text>The 1998 Winter Olympics, officially known as the and commonly known as Nagano 1998 (), were a winter multi-sport event held from 7 to 22 February 1998, mainly in Nagano, Nagano Prefecture, Japan, with some events taking place in the nearby mountain communities of Hakuba, Karuizawa, Nozawa Onsen, and Yamanouchi. The city of Nagano had previously been a candidate to host the 1940 Winter Olympics (which were later cancelled), as well as the 1972 Winter Olympics, but had been eliminated at the national level by Sapporo on both occasions.

The games hosted 2,176 athletes from 72 nations competing in 7 sports and 68 events. The number of athletes and participating nations were a record at the time. The Games saw the introduction of women&#x27;s ice hockey, curling and snowboarding. National Hockey League players were allowed to participate in the men&#x27;s ice hockey for the first time. Azerbaijan, Kenya, Macedonia, Uruguay, and Venezuela made their debut at the Winter Olympics.

The athlete who won the most medals at these games was the Russian cross-country skier Larisa Lazutina who won five medals, including three gold. The Norwegian cross-country skier Bjørn Dæhlie won four medals, including three gold, which took his total Olympic medal total to 12, including eight gold, which is a record for Winter Olympics. Czech men&#x27;s ice hockey team won the gold medal. In Ski Jumping, Kazuyoshi Funaki won two gold medals and one silver for host Japan. The American Figure skater Tara Lipinski became the youngest champion in Olympic history at the age of 15 years and 255 days. Germany dominated the medal table with 29 medals, including 12 gold. Germany was followed by Norway and Russia, who won 25 and 18 medals respectively. Canada, which finished fourth in the medal table with 15 medals, including six gold, had its most successful Winter Olympics up until that point.

The host was selected on 15 June 1991, over Salt Lake City, Östersund, Jaca and Aosta. They were the third Olympic Games and second Winter Olympics to be held in Japan, after the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo. The games were succeeded by the 1998 Winter Paralympics from 5 to 14 March. These were the final Winter Olympic Games under the IOC Presidency of Juan Antonio Samaranch.

The hosting of the games improved transportation networks with the construction of the high-speed &quot;Shinkansen&quot;, the Nagano Shinkansen, now the Hokuriku Shinkansen, between Tokyo and Nagano Station, via Ōmiya and Takasaki. In addition, new highways were built, including the Nagano Expressway and the Jōshin-etsu Expressway and upgrades were made to existing roads.

==Host city selection==

In 1932, Japan won the rights to host the 1940 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. At that time, organizers of the Summer Olympics had priority in choosing the venue for the Winter Olympics the same year. Several Japanese cities, including Nagano, prepared a bid. Sapporo was chosen; however, the games never took place because of World War II. In 1961, Nagano declared its intention to host the 1968 Winter Olympics but lost to Sapporo, the winning Japanese bid, who lost to Grenoble, France, and Sapporo eventually won the right to host the 1972 Winter Olympics.

Japanese private sector organizations, in 1983, began publicly discussing a possible bid. Two years later, in 1985, the Nagano Prefectural Assembly, decided to begin the process to bid, for its third time, for a Winter Olympics. The bid committee was established in July 1986, they submitted their bid to the Japanese Olympic Committee (JOC) in November of the same year. Other Japanese cities that were bidding were Asahikawa, Yamagata, and Morioka. 1 June 1988, the JOC selected Nagano in the first round of national voting, receiving 34 of 45 votes. In 1989, the bid committee was reorganized, with the Japanese Prime Minister as head of the committee. The number of committee members was 511.

On 12 February 1990, the bid delegation presented its candidature at the International Olympic Committee in Lausanne before Juan Antonio Samaranch. Other candidate cities for the 1998 Olympics were Aosta, Italy; Jaca, Spain; Östersund, Sweden; Salt Lake City, United States, and Sochi, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union (now Russia). The host city selection was held in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 15 June 1991, at the 97th IOC session. After the first round of voting, Nagano led, with Aosta and Salt Lake City tied for last. Aosta was eliminated in a run-off against Salt Lake City. After the second round of voting, Nagano led with Salt Lake City in second, and Jaca was eliminated. Following round 3, Nagano continued to lead, with Salt Lake City in second, and Östersund was eliminated. Finally, Nagano prevailed over Salt Lake City by just 4 votes in the fifth round of voting, becoming the third Japanese city to host the games after Tokyo in 1964 Summer Olympics and Sapporo in 1972. Nagano, at 36°N, is the southernmost city in the Northern hemisphere to host the Winter Olympics (1960 Winter Olympics host Squaw Valley, California is 39°N). In June 1995, Salt Lake was chosen as the host of the following 2002 Winter Olympics.

Following a 2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal that occurred in the summer of 2000, Atlanta, host of the 1996 Summer Olympics, Nagano, and Sydney, host of the 2000 Summer Olympics, were suspected of similar improprieties in bidding practices. Although nothing illegal was ever done, gifts to IOC members were considered morally dubious. The Nagano Olympic bid committee spent approximately $14 million to entertain the 62 International Olympic Committee members and many of their companions. The precise figures are unknown since Nagano, after the IOC asked that the entertainment expenditures not be made public, destroyed the financial records, according to bid member Junichi Yamaguchi.

==Organization==

Five months after the city was selected, the Nagano Olympic Organizing Committee (NAOC) was created. Eishiro Saito, Chairman of Japan Business Federation (Keidanren) was selected as president of the committee. There were four Vice Presidents: Goro Yoshimura, the Governor of Nagano Prefecture; Hironoshin Furuhashi, president of the Japanese Olympic Committee; Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, the president of the Ski Association of Japan; and Tasuku Tsukada, the Mayor of Nagano City. In addition, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Tadashi Tsuda, served as director-general. Tsuda was replaced by Makoto Kobayashi in 1993.

The organizing committee recognized three goals for the games, which they referred to as &quot;Games from the Heart&quot;: promote youth participation, coexistence with nature, create a festival with peace and friendship at its centre. To realize the first goal, a camp bringing together 217 young people from 51 countries was created, along with the program of &quot;One school, one country&quot; in Nagano Prefecture. This program organized cultural exchanges with other countries. In addition, more than 100,000 tickets were reserved for children. For the second point, the organizers attempted to minimize the impact on their nature and the local ecosystem. Regarding the third point, an international truce organized by the United Nations in 1997 was adopted during the games.
In June 1998, four months after the Games, the NAOC presented a donation of US$1 million to the Olympic Museum in Lausanne. This value come of the revenue of tickets sales and another actions from the committee. In October of the same year, NAOC also donated the 3-D high vision theater and some structures that were used in Nagano Olympic Villages to the Olympic Museum.

In February 1999, one year after the Games, the IOC awarded the Nagano the Olympic Cup, and presented the city a replica of the sculpture of stylized athletes raising the Olympic Flag by the Swiss artist Nag Arnoldi.

===Economic aspects===

The costs of construction and of the land of the Olympic venues totaled ¥106.6 billion, approximately 914 million US dollars. Of this, the Japanese national government spent ¥51.1 billion, the Nagano prefectural government spent ¥29.6 billion, and the cities and towns of Nagano, ¥23.4 billion; Hakuba, ¥1 billion; and Nozawa Onsen, ¥1.1 billion; shared the remaining ¥25.5 billion. The most expensive venue was impressive M-Wave, the indoor rink which hosted the long-track speed skating events. It cost near ¥34.8 billion. The two ice hockey venues, Big Hat and Aqua Wing Arena cost ¥19.1 and ¥9.1 billion respectively. The White Ring (arena), which hosted figure skating and short-track speed skating cost ¥14.2 billion, the Spiral, which hosted bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton, cost ¥10.1 billion. Another ¥8.6 billion was spent on the Hakuba Ski Jumping Stadium, ¥7 billion for Snow Harp – the cross-country skiing venue, and ¥3 billion for the biathlon venue at Nozawa Onsen Snow Resort.

The organizing committee financed all costs, totaling ¥113.9 billion. It spent ¥99.4 billion for operational expenses, ¥21.6 billion for public relations, ¥20.7 billion for installations, ¥18.4 billion for telecommunications, ¥15.9 billion for running the competitions, and ¥14.4 billion for administration. Television rights were worth ¥35.4 billion, and marketing earned ¥31.3 billion. Ticket sales were worth ¥10.5 billion. The total cost of the Nagano Games is estimated to have been US$15.25 billion (in 2015), of which the largest factor in the cost of the games was the extension of the shinkansen to Nagano. This compares, for example, with US$2.5 billion for the 2002 Winter Olympics, US$4.35 billion for the 2006 Winter Olympics, US$7.56 billion for the 2010 Winter Olympics, and US$51 billion for the 2014 Winter Olympics

===Transportation===

Nagano is situated at the Japanese Alps area and receives large snowfalls every year. These combined to make transportation an important challenge for the organizing committee. In addition, the Olympic Village was a distance of 7 kilometers from the center of the city, and sporting events were spread over five surrounding cities. The complicating matters were that many of the venues had one single road in-out, which limited possibilities and led to traffic jams.

To improve access to Nagano, the government decided to link the prefecture with the high-speed &quot;shinkansen&quot; train network. Called Nagano Shinkansen (now the Hokuriku Shinkansen), it was inaugurated five months before the start of the Games. This reduced by half the travel time between Tokyo and Nagano, to 79 minutes for 221 kilometers. The length of the track between Takasaki Station and Nagano Station is 125.7 km, which includes 63.4 km of tunnels. The high speed train network carried 655,000 passengers during the Games.

Two highways, the Nagano Expressway and the Jōshin-etsu Expressway, were also built in the Nagano region. In May 1993, the 75.8-kilometer section of the Nagano Expressway was completed, and in October 1997, the 111.4 kilometer section of the Jōshin-etsu Expressway was completed. In addition, another 114.9 kilometers of roads within Nagano Prefecture were improved.

Transportation systems for the Games ran for 33 days, from the opening of the Athletes Village until 3 days after the Paralympics closing ceremony, when the Village was decommissioned from its functions. Approximately 64% of the athletes arrived between 1 and 6 February, and 74% left Nagano between 22 and 25 February. Logistical operations were directed from the operational centre situated at the Organizing Committee headquarters. Two regional logistical minor hubs were created in Hakuba and Yamanouchi, as well as a traffic center for buses and cars in Karuizawa. Originally it was expected that both athletes and media delegations would arrive entirely via Narita International Airport, which did not happen given the high demand for plane tickets. So some delegations had to arrive via Kansai International Airport and Chubu Centrair International Airport in Nagoya The members of the IOC and the delegations who arrived in Narita traveled to Nagano via Shinkansen.
To improve transportation for spectators, the number and hours of local trains were extended. During the heaviest traffic days, more cars and buses were put in service and up to 68 parking areas, for 8,000 vehicles were at available for various Olympic delegations, and another 17 parking areas for 23,000 cars for spectators. Approximately 1,200 vehicles had navigation systems which transmitted their locations in a GPS system.

As one of the principal aims of the Games was to respect nature, many vehicles were considered ecological or semi-ecological. In addition, there were more than 100 electric vehicles, hybrid mini-buses and other environmentally-friendly vehicles.

===Marketing===

The emblem of the 1998 Winter Olympics consisted of a stylized snow flower with each petal representing an athlete participating in a winter sport. The figure could also represent a snowflake, or a mountain flower, which refers to the importance of the natural environment to the city of Nagano. Similarly, Tokyo used cherry blossoms in its logo for its candidature for the 2020 Summer Olympics.

Landor Associates conceived the official mascots that were used by the communication team for the Games. They consisted of four owlets, Sukki, Nokki, Lekki and Tsukki, also called &quot;Snowlets&quot;. The names were chosen from more than 47,000 suggestions. Four represents the number of years between each Olympic Games, and also represent the four elements, fire, air, earth, and water.

The official poster for the Games was designed by the graphic designer Masuteru Aoba presented a thrush perched on ski poles with light in the background shining on snow-capped mountain peaks. Here, as with the emblem and the mascots, the importance of the natural environment in these Olympic Games and a desire to create harmony between athletes and the natural surroundings are shown. In addition to the official poster, a separate poster was created for the opening ceremony. Marketing for the games cost the organizing committee 5.9 billion yen.

These Olympic Games were sponsored by 11 worldwide partners, 8 gold partners, and 18 official supports and suppliers. Marketing revenues for sponsoring or for the rights to use the emblems and mascots of the Games totaled 31.3 billion yen.

====Mascots====

Sukki, Nokki, Lekki and Tsukki, also known as the Snowlets, are the 1998 Winter Olympic mascots and are four snowy owls. They represent respectively fire (Sukki), air (Nokki), earth (Lekki) and water (Tsukki) and together they represent the four major islands of Japan.

====Sponsors of the 1998 Winter Olympics====
The development of Rights Packages were based on International Olympic Committee policy of offering exclusive rights to a limited number of companies, with one company allowed to purchase the rights for any single product or service category, and these were based on previous Games, with adaptations for the local market. Sponsors were permitted to use the emblem and mascots as long as consent was obtained from the International Olympic Committee, Japanese Olympic Committee, and the NAOC. Hospitality packages for sponsors included priority for accommodations, tickets, and transportation services. The Sponsor Hospitality Village, next to the Nagano Olympic Stadium, welcomed 32,000 guests.

To promote awareness of the sponsors, advertising was done in various media from 1995, and on banners and buses immediately before the games. Dick Pound noted, during the Games, the excellence of the marketing program, citing the &quot;perfect example of how the private and public sectors can work together&quot;.

===Ticket sales===
From 7 February 1997, the organizing committee put up for sale 1,286,000 tickets for the various competitions and ceremonies. The number of tickets sold was 1,149,615, which represented 89.4% of available tickets. Including people connected to the Games, the total number of spectators was 1,275,529. This number was slightly higher than in 1994 as a result of the greater availability of tickets. This reflected the total capacity of the arenas used, which were mostly larger than those used four years earlier but slightly lower than the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. Tickets sales were a success in the domestic market, as the Japanese people finished the process of purchase with a reservation list of 6 million. For the most popular events, a lottery system was used. In total, ticket sales raised 10.5 billion yen for the organizing committee.

The ice hockey matches represented 295,802 tickets sold, 26% of the total. Tickets sold for alpine skiing totaled 166,092; for ski jumping, 96,000, and speed skating, 93,000. For multiple sports, ski jumping, Nordic combined, freestyle skiing, all three skating disciplines, bobsleigh, and curling, as well as the ceremonies, all tickets were sold. By contrast, due the local demands and low interest only 56.6% of the 146,000 available tickets for cross-country skiing were sold.

===Cost and cost overrun===
&quot;The Oxford Olympics Study&quot; established the outturn cost of the Nagano 1998 Winter Olympics at US$2.2 billion in 2015-dollars and cost overrun at 56% in real terms. This includes sports-related costs only, that is, (i) &quot;operational costs&quot; incurred by the organizing committee for the purpose of staging the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) &quot;direct capital costs&quot; incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build, e.g., the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which are required to host the Games. Indirect capital costs are &quot;not&quot; included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, or for hotel upgrades or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The cost and cost overrun for Nagano 1998 compares with costs of US$2.5 billion and a cost overrun of 13% for Vancouver 2010, and costs of US$51 billion and a cost overrun of 289% for Sochi 2014, the latter being the most costly Olympics to date. Average cost for Winter Games since 1960 is US$3.1 billion, average cost overrun is 142%.

==Venues==



===Sport sites===
During the 1998 Winter Olympics, a total of fourteen sports venues, all within Nagano Prefecture, were used. Construction of these venues lasted 7 years between 1990 and 1997, with construction and land costs totaling ¥106.6 billion. The most expensive venue constructed for the games was the M-Wave who hosted the speed skating events.This venue is in a distance from 5 kilometers from Nagano Station. Between March 1996 and November 1997, these sites were tested with 16 different World Championship events, World Cups, and another international competitions to allow the organizers to prepare for the running of the Games.

Five new venues were used, localized all inside city of Nagano urban area. The project to build the Olympic Stadium and the 4 indoor arenas was planned even before the plans for the Olympic bid. However, these plans were accelerated soon after the submission of the proposal to the Japanese Olympic Committee, as the city had no infrastructure available for any type of event available. The Nagano Olympic Stadium is the main sporting venue of the south of city, is on nearby Shinonoi Station, and approximately 9 kilometers from Nagano Station.

==The Games==
===The Olympic torch relay===
The Olympic torch was lit by sunlight during the ceremony held Temple of Hera at Olympia, Greece on 19 December 1997. Vassilis Dimitriadis, a Greek alpine skier started the Greek leg towards Athens where the handover ceremony was held at the Panathenaic Stadium.The flame burned from 27 to 30 December in the Ginza yard, and from 31 December to 4 January in the Yoyogi Park.On the morning on that day the flame was split into three and taken by plane to three destinations: the Kantō route, starting from Hokkaido; the Pacific Ocean route, starting from Kagoshima; and the Sea of Japan route starting in Okinawa.On 23 January evening, the three flames arrived on Nagano Prefecture after 120 stops. Finally, these three routes were unified in the city of Nagano in on the night of 6 February. The following day, after traveling through each district of the city, the relays simultaneously arrived at the central square where three former athletes passed the flames to three members of the organizing committee who lit a celebration cauldron gathering the flame into one. After that, the unified flame was used to light another torch held by Juan Antonio Samaranch. In the early hours of the 7 February morning, the final leg started and the flame travelled another 10 kilometers to the Olympic Stadium and the figure skater Midori Ito lit the cauldron at Nagano Olympic Stadium during the opening ceremonies.

The Olympic Flame Relay in Japan was sponsored by Coca-Cola, lasted 33 days and travelled 1,162 kilometers. A group of 5.5 million people took part in relay activities. Over the distance of the relay, the flame was always followed by a group of six people: the torchbearer who carried the flame, some who accompanied the carrier, and four people in supporting roles, for a total of 6,901 people. In addition, each leg was followed by two groups of 11 vehicles and more than 20 people.

The torch was shaped like a traditional Japanese &quot;taimatsu&quot; torch. It was made of aluminum, was 55 centimeters long, and weighed 1.3 kilograms when it was assembled. The exterior of the torch was coloured silver, to represent winter. Runners wore blue and white uniforms mixing blue as the main colour of the look of the games and the white as snow. The runners&#x27; uniforms included logos for the Nagano Olympics and the Olympic Games, a logo of the relay, and of Coca-Cola.

===Participating National Olympic Committees===

The silver medalist from the 1994 Winter Olympics, the Norwegian Bjarte Engen Vik, was the 1997–98 FIS Nordic Combined World Cup leader. At the Hakuba Ski Jumping Stadium, Vik led after the first two jumps. He was followed by the Russian Valeri Stoliarov. The following day, the skiers left, in order of the placement following the ski jump, along te 15 kilometer cross-country race at the Snow Harp. The race was skied in the rain. Vik led throughout and finished with a 27.5 second lead over second place. With three kilometers to the finish line, the Finnish athlete, 18-year-old Samppa Lajunen, who was sixth after the jumps, caught up with Stoliarov. The skied together until the stadium, and 60 meters from the finish line, Lajunen passed the Russian and picked up the silver medal 0.7 seconds ahead of Stoliarov who won the bronze. The fastest athlete on the course was the Swiss skier, Marco Zarucchi, who was 43rd after the jumps, finished in 25th place.

Eleven nations took part in the team event on 19 and 20 February. At previous Olympics, the team event involved three athletes per team, with the completing a 3x10 kilometer relay. At Nagano, the team was enlarged to four athletes who completed a 4x5 kilometer relay. After the jumps, the team from Finland led by four seconds ahead of the Austrians, eight seconds ahead of the Norwegians, nine ahead of the Czechs, and 29 seconds ahead of the Japanese. The relay took place in rain. The Norwegians quickly took the lead and never looked back. The last Norwegian skier had the time to grab his country&#x27;s flag with 500 meters from the finish line, and they won gold with more than one minute lead over the team from Finland. The French team, sixth after the jumps, won the bronze medal ahead of the Austrians. The Japanese, gold medalists at the 1992 Winter Olympics and 1994 Winter Olympics finished in fifth.

====Ski jumping====
The ski jumping competitions took place at the Hakuba Ski Jumping Stadium in Hakuba village, 50 kilometers west of Nagano City. In all, 68 athletes from 19 countries participated. For the first time, the top 30 jumpers qualified for the second round. Host Japan won the most medals, including two gold in the large hill and large hill team. Finland, Germany, and Austria rounded out the medal table. Kazuyoshi Funaki from Yoichi, Hokkaido in Japan won two gold and one silver for the host country.

The normal hill jumps took place on 11 February in front of 45,000 spectators. The Japanese, who had dominated the 1997–98 FIS Ski Jumping World Cup season, were the favorites. With a jump of 91.5 meters, Masahiko Harada led after the first round ahead of the Finnish jumper, Jani Soininen
Kazuyoshi Funaki, who was fourth after the first round, took the lead with a jump of 90.5 meters in the second round. After a delay caused by strong wind, Soininen took the lead with only Harada still to jump. A sidewind blew when Harada jumped, and only managed 84.5 meters to finish in fifth place overall. Soininen won gold with 234.5 points, Funaki was second with 233.5, and the Austrian Andreas Widhölzl finished third with 232.5 points.

On 15 February, the large hill jump competition took place. 60,000 spectators gathered at Hakuba Ski Jumping Stadium. Normal hill bronze medalist Widhölzl led after the first round, ahead of the Japanese jumper Takanobu Okabe, Jani Soininen et Funaki. In the second round, Funaki jumped 132.5 m, and, for the first time at the Olympics, received perfect points for his style. He jumped into first place and won the gold medal with 272.3 points overall. It was the first Japanese gold medal in ski jumping since the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo. Harada jumped next. Unfortunately, the measurement system was installed between 95 and 135 meters and his jump was beyond that. He was measured manually to be 136 meters. He also had good points but only managed to win the bronze medal with 258.3. meters. Soininen won the silver with a combined score of 260.8 points.

At the 1994 Winter Olympics, the Japanese team were the favorites but Harada jumped poorly, costing the Japanese the gold medal. Again, in 1998, the Japanese were the favorites. The team event took place on 17 February. The start was slowed by 30 minutes because of heavy falling snow. The first two Japanese jumpers, Okabe at Hiroya Saitō, jumped Japan into first place. Harada completely missed his jump, jumping only 79.5 meters, and despite Funaki having a good jump, Japan drop from first to fourth after the first round behind Austria, Germany, and Norway. Okabe jumped 137 meters, which was an Olympic record. Saitō followed this with a good jump. Harada was next, and like Okabe, jumped 137 meters. The last jumper was Funaki who jumped 125 meters, and the Japanese team became Olympic champions with 933.0 points. The Germans won silver with 897.4 points, and the Austrians finished with 881.5 points for the bronze.

====Snowboarding====

In the decade leading up the games, snowboarding had become popular in both North America and Europe, as well as Japan, and as a result, in August 1994, the NAOC received a request from the IOC president Samaranch to consider including snowboarding at the 1998 Winter Olympics. To reduce costs, NAOC asked the host community to cover a portion of the costs – the town Yamanouchi agreed – and FIS was expected to support financially as well. In November 1995, the NAOC executive board agreed to add snowboarding, and this was approved by the IOC at their December meeting the following month in Karuizawa. This was the first Winter Olympics with snowboarding events. The events took place at Mount Yakebitai and Kanbayashi Snowboard Park in Yamanouchi, Nagano, 30 kilometers northeast of Nagano City, from 8 to 12 February. In all, 125 athletes from 22 countries participated in the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s halfpipe and giant slalom. Athletes from Germany won two medals, including one gold. Athletes from Switzerland, France, and Canada also won gold medals.

In the men&#x27;s giant slalom, the Canadian Jasey-Jay Anderson won the first race with a half-second lead ahead of Rebagliati. During the second race, the event was temporary delayed because of snow and fog. Ross Rebagliati finished with a combined time of 2:03.96, 0.02 seconds ahead of the Italian Thomas Prugger, and another 0.10 seconds ahead of the Swiss Ueli Kestenholz. Controversy occurred when three days after the men&#x27;s giant slalom, the International Olympic Committee determined that gold medalist Rebagliati from Canada, was disqualified after testing positive for marijuana. It was the first time in Olympic history that an athlete was disqualified for marijuana. The Canadian Olympic Committee lodged a protest and the case quickly went to the Court of Arbitration for Sport where it was ruled that because marijuana was not classified as a &quot;banned&quot; substance, the medal should be returned to the Canadian athlete. In the halfpipe, the gold medal went to the Swiss Gian Simmen, who had the highest score, 85.2, despite a heavy rain. The Norwegian Daniel Franck won the silver with a score of 82.4, and the American Ross Powers won the bronze with a score of 82.1.

The women&#x27;s giant slalom was delayed one day because of a snowstorm. The big favorite, the Frenchwoman Karine Ruby won the first race with almost two seconds ahead of her compatriot Isabelle Blanc. Ruby won the second race, with Blanc missing the last gate and falling. Ruby&#x27;s combined time was 2:17.34. The German Heidi Renoth won the silver with a time of 2:19.17, and the Austrian Brigitte Köck won the bronze with a time of 2:19.42. In the halfpipe, the Norwegian Stine Brun Kjeldaas won the qualification round. However, in the finals, the German Nicola Thost, a former gymnast, finished second in both legs, scored 74.6 points, which was enough for the gold medal. Stine Brun Kjeldaas finished fourth in the first leg and first in second, winning the silver with 74.2 points. The American Shannon Dunn-Downing won the first leg, but finished seventh in the second leg, leaving her with the bronze with a score of 72.8.

==Mascots==

The mascots of the 1998 Winter Olympics are four owls named Sukki, Nokki, Lekki and Tsukki, also known as the Snowlets.

==Media==
The Nagano Olympics were covered by more than 10,000 members of the media, including 8,329 accredited journalists, of which 2,586 were from newspaper media and 5,743 television and radio journalists. The Organizing Committee established a Main Press Center (MPC), over two buildings, and 17 annexes throughout the different sites. The International Broadcast Centre (IBC) was a temporary one-storey facility constructed on the grounds of a former textile mill in the immediate vicinity of the MPC and Big Hat. A wide range of general services, such as a restaurants, cafeterias, banks, post offices and a medical clinics were available at the IBC. The IBC was later converted into a departament store, &quot;K&#x27;s Town Wakasato Store&quot;.

The MBC, which is today the &quot;Wakasato Civic Cultural Center&quot;, was built beside Big Hat, the main ice hockey venue. The MBC had a surface area of 42,728 m2, with one principal room for 600 journalists of 1430m2 and another of 5100m2 that was rented by various press agencies. The largest press offices at the Games were Kyodo News, Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, Reuters, and Deutsche Presse-Agentur. The MBC also included a press conference room for 600 people.

The host broadcaster for the Games, the Olympic Radio and Televisions Organization (ORTO&#x27;98) was established as a separate organization within NAOC, the organizing committee. ORTO&#x27;98 was joint-venture created between NHK, the Japanese public broadcaster, the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), and NAOC. A total of 1647 staff worked 386 cameras at the various venues and events, with coverage increasing by 55% over the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer. The Games were broadcast in 160 countries, 40 more than in Lillehammer, and it was estimated that 10.7 billion viewers watched the Games over the 16-day period. Some events were filmed and broadcast in analog high-definition television, with NHK broadcasting over 270 hours of coverage in Japan.

Broadcasting rights totaled USD$513 million, which was a record for the Winter Olympics, and all contracts with 16 broadcasting rights&#x27; holders were record sums. This money was split 60–40 between NAOC and the International Olympic Committee. The American broadcasting network, CBS, paid 375 million US dollars, to air the Games in the United States. The 1998 Winter Olympics are the most recent Olympic Games to not air on NBC in the United States, as the current contract with NBC started in 1999.

<text>A posthumous name is an honorary name given mainly to revered dead people in East Asian culture. It is predominantly used in Asian countries such as China, Korea, Vietnam, Japan, Malaysia and Thailand. Reflecting on the person&#x27;s accomplishments or reputation, the title is assigned after death and essentially replaces the name used during life. Although most posthumous names are given to royalty, some posthumous names are given to honour significant people without hereditary titles, such as courtiers or military generals.

To create a posthumous name, one or more adjectives are inserted before the deceased&#x27;s title. The name of the state or domain of the owner may be added to avoid ambiguity.

== History ==

===Origins===
Early mythological rulers such as Emperor Yao were known to have posthumous names. Archaeological discoveries have shown that the titles of kings as far back as the Zhou dynasty (1046 to 256 BC) are posthumous names, as in the cases of King Wu and King Wen. Posthumous names commonly made tracing linear genealogies simpler and kept a bloodline apparent.

In the Zhou dynasty, the posthumous name was usually only one character, such as &quot;Wen&quot; (&#x27;cultured&#x27;) or &quot;Wu&quot; (&#x27;martial&#x27;). Over time, rulers began adding more characters to their ancestors&#x27; posthumous names. By the time of the first emperor of Tang, the length had grown to seven characters, which was taxing to pronounce or write. Therefore, emperors after the Tang dynasty are commonly referred to by either their temple name (Tang through Yuan dynasties) or era name (Ming and Qing dynasties), both of which are always two characters long.

===Later developments===
The use of posthumous names temporarily stopped when emperor Qin Shi Huang of the Qin dynasty proclaimed it disrespectful for the descendants of emperors to judge their elders by assigning them descriptive titles. The Han dynasty resumed using posthumous names after the fall of the Qin.

Posthumous names were used by non-Han rulers of the Sixteen Kingdoms, Nanzhao, Liao dynasty, Western Xia, Jin dynasty, Yuan dynasty, Qing dynasty, Silla, Japan, and Vietnam. King names of Hồng Bàng dynasty and Mahan followed the posthumous naming but are considered later works. Some rulers, such as Wu Zetian or rebel leaders, had similarly styled regnal names when they were alive.

Most monarchs inherited the throne and did not give negative posthumous names to the previous monarch. Later monarchs lengthened or changed some names. Emperor Aizong of Jin and the Chongzhen Emperor were referred to by different names by different people. Qin Hui of the Song dynasty had a name with a positive connotation, was then given a negative one, and later had the positive name restored. After the Song dynasty, few received negative names. In Korea, the disfavored monarchs of the Joseon dynasty did not receive posthumous names.

==General guidelines==

===Selection===
Posthumous names can be praises () or deprecations (). There are more praises than deprecations, so posthumous names are also commonly called &quot;respectful names&quot; () in Chinese. Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; extensively outlines the rules behind choosing the names. Most qualifications for a given name are subjective, repetitive, and highly stereotypical, meaning posthumous names are often chosen arbitrarily. Court historians usually provide such names according to the deceased&#x27;s notable deeds.

=== Format ===

When combining an emperor&#x27;s temple name and posthumous name, the temple name is placed first. For example, the Shunzhi Emperor, whose full posthumous title would be &quot;Shizu, Emperor Zhang&quot; (), combines his temple name and the last three characters of his posthumous reputation, which is the form most commonly seen in formal documents. Some monarchs&#x27; and royal members&#x27; posthumous names were extended, such as Hongwu Emperor, Nurhaci, Crown Prince Hyomyeong, Sunjo of Joseon, and Empress Dowager Cixi.

Some monarchs did not follow these guidelines; for example, monarchs of Ju, Chu, and Qi used place names, while some monarchs of Yue had Chinese transliterated posthumous words, and some monarchs of Goguryeo, Silla, and Baekje had differently styled posthumous names. Some early Japanese monarchs also had .

==China==

&quot;Shihao&quot; () is a Chinese term that means posthumous name and title. The names of living Chinese people may be any combination of characters. Most often, posthumous names are chosen from a relatively small list, with their literal meaning eroding as a result.

=== Format ===
The Chinese language format for posthumous names is &quot;[&quot;state&quot;] [&quot;adjective&quot;] [&quot;title&quot;]&quot;. When translated into English, they take on the format &quot;[&quot;title&quot;] [&quot;adjective&quot;] of [&quot;state&quot;]&quot;, such as King Wen of Zhou (&#x27;Cultured King of Zhou&#x27;), Duke Mu of Qin (&#x27;Solemn Duke of Qin&#x27;), and King Cheng of Chu (&#x27;Accomplished King of Chu&#x27;). The literal meaning of the adjective usually needs to be translated.

=== Recipients ===

==== Monarchs and consorts ====
All Chinese posthumous names for rulers end in one or two of the characters for &quot;emperor&quot;, (), which can be shortened to , except about a dozen less-recognized ones who have had only and not .

Starting with Emperor Xiaowen of Han (more commonly Emperor Wen), every single Han emperor, except the first of the Eastern Han dynasty, has the character of &#x27;filial&#x27; () at the beginning of his posthumous name. &#x27;Filial&#x27; is also used in the full posthumous names of virtually all emperors and empresses of the Tang, Song, Ming and Qing dynasties. For Qing emperors, the character is placed in various positions in the string of characters. For Qing empresses given posthumous names, is always initial.

The number of characters in posthumous names increased over time. The emperors of the Tang dynasty have posthumous names between 7 and 18 characters, while most in the Qing dynasty have more than 20 characters. For instance, the Shunzhi Emperor&#x27;s posthumous name has 25 characters. The woman with the longest posthumous name (also 25 characters) is Empress Dowager Cixi; the shortened version of the name was (&#x27;the Distinguished Empress who was Admirably Filial&#x27;).

==== Members of the ruling family ====
According to the noble system since the Zhou dynasty, the immediate family members of the emperor were given the titles like King, Prince, Duke, or Earl, with or without actual control over a region. After their death, they would be referred to by the same title, with the posthumous name (usually one character) inserted in the middle. The characters used are mainly those used for emperors. For example, Prince Gong of the Qing dynasty was posthumously named Zhong () and thus is referred to as Prince Gongzhong (). Prince Chun was posthumously named Xian (), and is therefore referred to as Prince Chunxian ().

The posthumous name could include more than one character. For example, Prince Shuncheng Lekdehun was posthumously honoured as Prince Shuncheng Gonghui (). Yinxiang, Prince Yi was granted a posthumous name consisting of 9 characters, ().

==== Officials ====
It was also common for people with no hereditary titles, primarily accomplished scholar-officials or ministers, to be given posthumous names by the imperial court. The characters used are mainly the same as those used for emperors. The length, however, was restricted to one or two characters. The posthumous name is sometimes rendered canonization in English, for the scholar-official to Confucianism is considered analogous to the saint in the Catholic Church. However, the process is shorter.

Confucius has been given long posthumous names in almost every prominent dynasty; one of the most commonly used was (). Sometimes a person is given a posthumous name not by the court, but by his family or disciples. Such names are private posthumous names (). For example, the given to Tao Qian was ().

=== Modern use and discontinuation ===
The emperors of China continued to receive posthumous names of increasing length as a matter of ritual long after the naming convention had been abandoned in casual speech and writing. The Guangxu Emperor, who died in 1908 and was the last emperor to receive a posthumous name, has a 21-character title: &quot;Emperor Tongtian Chongyun Dazhong Zhizheng Jingwen Weiwu Renxiao Ruizhi Duanjian Kuanqin Jing&quot;. Puyi, the last emperor of China, did not receive a posthumous name upon his death in 1967.

==Korea==
In Silla, every monarch was given the title of &quot;wang&quot; () with two characters in posthumous names from Jijeung of Silla. On the other hand, all posthumous names for kings of Balhae were restricted to one character. Most of the kings of Goryeo and Joseon were more often given temple names than posthumous names, unlike in the dynasties of ancient Korea. All posthumous names for the rulers of Goryeo and Joseon end in two of the characters for &quot;Daewang&quot; (). This is a longer name made up of adjectives characteristic of the king&#x27;s rule.

Details of the system of posthumous names were recorded during the Joseon dynasty. During the Joseon dynasty, officials discussed and decided on the king&#x27;s posthumous name five days after the king&#x27;s funeral. Before his temple and posthumous names were chosen, the deceased king was called &quot;Daehaeng daewang&quot; (). The Ministry of Culture and Education () was in charge of the naming. The Ministry of Culture and Education selected three candidates and reported them to the next king, who chose the name he liked best.

The deposed kings&#x27; names were made up of three parts: the temple name (), eulogistic names (), and posthumous names (). A deposed king was not given any posthumous names with temple names unless reinstated. They were degraded to the rank of a &quot;gun&quot; (); Yeonsan-gun and Gwanghae-gun are notable examples. Some men did not ascend to the throne in their lifetime but were proclaimed kings after they died by their descendants who became kings. In Joseon, nine men were raised to the status of emeritus kings.

Gojong of Joseon proclaimed Korea an empire in 1897, receiving the title of emperor, thus the posthumous names of Gojong and Sunjong end in two of the characters for &quot;Hwangje&quot; (). Crown Prince Hyomyeong has been given the longest posthumous name in Korea. He was posthumously elevated in status and given the title Emperor Munjo with 117 characters in posthumous names in 1899.
=== Modern use ===
In the Republic of Korea, the Jeonju Lee Royal Family Association has issued posthumous names, without the recognition the government, to Empress Sunjeonghyo; Crown Prince Euimin; and Gu, Prince Imperial Hoeun.

==Japan==
In Japan, posthumous names are divided into two types: &quot;shigō&quot; () and .

In addition to the title, is a part of all Japanese emperors&#x27; posthumous names, most of them consisting of two kanji characters, although a few have three. Some names are given several generations later—this is the case for Emperor Jimmu and Emperor Antoku, for example. Others are provided immediately after death, like that Emperor Monmu.

=== &quot;Shigō&quot; ===
A , or , name describes the accomplishments and the virtues of the rulers. There are two styles of emperors&#x27; &quot;shigō&quot;: and .

==== Chinese-style (Han-style) ====
* Jinmu Tennō (, ) – Emperor Jimmu
* Nintoku Tennō (, ) – Emperor Nintoku

Those who were named after the place where the emperor was born, lived or frequented:
* Saga Tennō () – Emperor Saga, named after a palace (&quot;in&quot;, )
* Ichijō Tennō () – Emperor Ichijō, named after an official residence (&quot;tei&quot;, )

Those who were named after an emperor whose admirable characteristics resemble those of an earlier one by adding as a prefix to the earlier emperor&#x27;s name:
* Go-Ichijō Tennō () – Emperor Go-Ichijō, who was preceded by Emperor Ichijō
* Go-Daigo Tennō () – Emperor Go-Daigo, who was preceded by Emperor Daigo
* Go-Sakuramachi Tennō () – Empress Go-Sakuramachi, who was preceded by her father Emperor Sakuramachi
The posthumous name of some emperors was derived from the combination of characters from two previous emperors&#x27; posthumous names:
* Empress Genmei + Empress Genshō → Empress Meishō
* Empress Shōtoku + Emperor Kōnin → Emperor Shōkō

=== Modern use ===
Official posthumous names are still used in Japan. This tradition began with Emperor Meiji. Since the death of in 1912, the posthumous name of an emperor has always been the era name of his reign. In such cases, the posthumous names belong to the category of &quot;tsuigō&quot;. After his death, Hirohito was formally renamed after his era; Japanese people now refer to him by only that name, and not by his given name Hirohito. Most Japanese people never refer to emperors by their given names, as it is considered disrespectful. A non-royal deceased person may be given a posthumous Buddhist name known as &quot;kaimyō&quot; but is, in practice, still referred to by the living name.

==Malay world==
In the Malay sultanates and other related sultanates and kingdoms of Southeast Asia, the posthumous names of the sultans and rulers always begin with the word &quot;Marhum&quot; (Jawi: ), an Arabic loanword meaning &#x27;the late ruler&#x27;. The word &quot;Marhum&quot; is followed by either the place of death or the burial site. Mahmud II of Johor, who was killed while being carried on a royal litter in 1699, was posthumously known as Marhum Mangkat dijulang, which literally means &#x27;the late ruler who died while being carried&#x27;.

Other Malay posthumous names include:
* Marhum Kampar (, ) – Mahmud Shah of Malacca
* Marhum Langgar (, ) – Muhammad Shah of Pahang

==Thailand==
Since the death of King Chulalongkorn in 1910, the king has been named for his reigning era formally used in the &quot;Royal Gazette&quot;. Some were given posthumous names to elevate their title, such as in the case of King Ananda, who was posthumously titled Phra Athamaramathibodin. Kings Ananda and Bhumibol do not have specific reign names, and other kings, such as Chulalongkorn, are referred to using personal names. Most Thai people never refer to the king by their unique name or the informal Chula Chom Klao, as it is considered disrespectful. The personal name of King Vajiralongkorn will be regarded as casual until his death, when it will be replaced with the reign name Vajilaklao.

== Vietnam ==

The use of posthumous names ceased in Vietnam with the Khải Định Emperor, who died in 1925.

<doc id="113193" wikidata="Q727139" url="?curid=113193" title="Earthworm Jim (video game)">
<text>Earthworm Jim is a 1994 run and gun platform game developed by Shiny Entertainment, featuring an earthworm named Jim, who wears a robotic suit and battles the forces of evil. The game was released for the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System, before being subsequently ported to several other video game consoles.

It had a positive reception from critics and received a sequel, &quot;Earthworm Jim 2&quot;, in 1995. In 2009, Gameloft developed and released a remake for mobile phones and Nintendo DSi which was later ported to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as &quot;Earthworm Jim HD&quot;. In February 2018, Gameloft&#x27;s contract with Interplay ended and all of the ports developed by Gameloft were removed from digital stores.

==Gameplay==
The game plays as a 2D sidescrolling platformer with elements of a run and gun game as well. The player controls Jim and must maneuver him through the level while avoiding obstacles and enemies. The player can use Jim&#x27;s gun as a method of shooting enemies, or his worm body as a whip for whipping enemies. The whip move also allows the player to grab hold of, and swing from, certain hooks. Some levels have additional requirements beyond merely getting to the end of the level. For example, the level &quot;For Pete&#x27;s Sake&quot;, involves making sure the computer-controlled Peter Puppy character gets through the level unharmed, which is accomplished by whipping him to make him jump over pits, and defeating enemies before they can damage him. Failure to do so results in Peter lashing out at Jim, depleting his health.

Levels commonly culminate with a boss battle. The game incorporates a large variety of villains in the boss battles, including Hickboy, Psy-Crow, Queen Slug-for-a-Butt, Evil the Cat, Bob the Killer Goldfish, Major Mucus, and Professor Monkey-for-a-Head-exclusive Robotic Chicken. Two villains made their only appearance in this game: Chuck, a junkyard man with a tendency to vomit bizarre objects; and Doc Duodenum, a crazed organ of a giant alien.

In between most levels, a racing level called &quot;Andy Asteroids&quot; is played. Unlike the rest of the game, it places the viewpoint behind Jim. The player must direct Jim on his rocket, in a race against Psy-Crow, through a tube-like structure while collecting items and boosts and avoiding asteroids. If the player wins, the next level is started instantly. If the player loses, a boss fight against Psy-Crow must be won to progress to the next level.

Other variations in gameplay occur throughout the game as well, such as a competitive bungee-jumping and fighting level, and an underwater maze that must be traversed both within a time limit and without crashing too many times.

==Plot==
Jim is a normal earthworm, until a special &quot;super suit&quot; falls from the sky and allows him to operate much like a human, with his worm body acting as a head and the suit acting as a body. Jim now must evade the game&#x27;s many antagonists, who want the suit back. The game plays out with Jim succeeding in his quest to meet Princess What&#x27;s-Her-Name. However, she is crushed by a cow that Jim launched into space at the beginning of the game.

==Development==
Playmates Toys, finding success with the license for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, wanted to start their own franchise. Inspired by the success of the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series with its first and second installments, they decided that they wanted to start the franchise as a video game, a rare approach at the time. From there, the game&#x27;s design actually started with Douglas TenNapel&#x27;s simple sketch of an earthworm that he presented to Shiny Entertainment. Impressed, programmer David Perry and the rest of Shiny bought the rights to Earthworm Jim from TenNapel and started developing the game. From there, TenNapel would work on doing the game design, making level ideas, and voicing Jim&#x27;s character, while Perry and the other programmers created additional characters and game mechanics. Perry recounted that the giant hamster &quot;was drawn by one of our guys at three o&#x27;clock one morning&quot;.

The game was developed simultaneously for the Genesis and Super NES using a &quot;custom heterogeneous programming language&quot; created by Shiny Entertainment. Almost all levels were first programmed by Dave Perry on the Genesis and then converted to the Super NES by Nick Jones. &quot;For Pete&#x27;s Sake&quot; was coded simultaneously on both platforms by Andy Astor, and &quot;Andy Asteroids&quot; and &quot;Snot a Problem&quot; were originally programmed on the Super NES by Nick Jones and then converted to the Genesis.

The game&#x27;s unique atmosphere, world, and characters were because the company had previously always been restricted to doing licensed games, like 7up&#x27;s &quot;Cool Spot&quot;, where they had to conform to the other company&#x27;s preset limitations. In that respect, the game was actually created as a satire of platform video games at the time. For instance, &quot;Princess What&#x27;s-Her-Name&quot; was a parody of how numerous video games had throw-away female characters that needed to be saved.

===Release===
The original version was released for the Genesis in October 1994. A version for the Super NES was released shortly after the original and is largely the same as the Genesis version. The Super NES version has altered graphics, with different backgrounds and special effects, but lacked some sound effects and one of the levels from the Genesis version (titled &quot;Intestinal Distress&quot;). The stated reason for the Genesis version having the extra level was that the &quot;Genesis version was more easily compressed and had the room for the bonus level&quot;. Subsequently, Nick Bruty stated in an interview that Sega asked Shiny Entertainment to add a level exclusively to the Sega version in exchange for reduced cartridge cost. Nick states that they designed the level overnight, and completed coding and testing the level in a single day (the day the game was sent to be printed to the consoles). The game was released in Japan physically only on Super Famicom on June 23, 1995, published by Takara, while the Japanese Mega Drive version was available exclusively via the Sega Channel service on December 1, 1995.

The game&#x27;s Genesis release was promoted with a television commercial in which an elderly woman tells a bedtime story about Earthworm Jim while eating live earthworms (actually plastic props). The networks airing the commercial received so many complaints from nauseated viewers that the commercial was pulled in some markets, including stations in Portland, Spokane, and Sacramento.

The game&#x27;s Special Edition was released for the Sega Genesis add-on, the Sega CD. It was based on the Genesis version, contained all of its levels, plus some extended sections and a single completely new level, titled &quot;Big Bruty&quot;, a new remixed Red Book CD audio soundtrack, as well as around 1,000 more frames of in-game animation. These versions were also the only ones to contain alternate endings when winning on the &quot;Easy&quot; or &quot;Difficult&quot; modes, in which a narrator (Doug TenNapel) rambles on about many (false) facts on worms or congratulates the player in a similar absurd manner respectively. The Special Edition was later ported to Windows 95 by Activision.

Another special edition of the game was released exclusively through the Sega Channel for a contest dubbed &quot;The Great Earthworm Jim Race&quot;. This version included a secret room which, when reached by the first 200 players, would display a password and a toll-free telephone number. Those who called the number were awarded prizes.

Eurocom ported a compressed and scaled down version for the Game Boy. It was hindered by the lack of color, lack of graphical detail due to both processor and small screen size, choppy animations, and a lack of buttons, which made it hard to control. This version was also ported to the Game Gear, which included color graphics, but still suffered from all of the other problems of the Game Boy version. A direct port of the Game Gear version was also brought to the Master System, but only in Brazil. However, it only has 4 levels, and the boss in &quot;What the Heck?&quot; is missing.

A conversion of the game was also being developed by German studio Softgold and planned to be published by Atari Corporation for both the Atari Jaguar and the Atari Jaguar CD, but it was never finished due to the departure of Normen B. Kowalewski from Atari, who was the lead developer of the port, sometime between or at the end of 1995. The alpha prototype, which consisted of basic character animations, and the source code of the conversion are currently lost.

The game also had an MS-DOS port released in a package titled &quot;Earthworm Jim 1 &amp; 2: The Whole Can &#x27;O Worms&quot; (along with the MS-DOS port of &quot;Earthworm Jim 2&quot;) with redrawn graphics and missing the level &quot;Intestinal Distress&quot;. The game was ported by Rainbow Arts.

In 2001, Game Titan ported the Super NES version to the Game Boy Advance. Despite the extra power of the Game Boy Advance, this version still ran very poorly, with bad animation, and missing details, and was widely criticized.

The game was re-released digitally on some platforms in the late 2000s as well. The original Genesis version was released through Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console service in Europe on October 3, 2008, in North America on October 27, 2008 and in Japan on December 16, 2008. The Genesis version was also re-released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack on September 15, 2022. The MS-DOS version was re-released through DOSbox emulation on GOG.com on October 7, 2008, and on Steam on November 4, 2009.

&quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; is included in the &quot;Sega Genesis Mini&quot; console.

===High-definition remake===
In 2009, Gameloft released digitally an updated remake of the game on a number of mobile/handheld platforms. The remake was made entirely from scratch, without using the original game&#x27;s code, and featured overhauled and smoothed graphics, a remixed soundtrack, a re-recorded voice of Jim, and touchscreen controls. Completely new, computer-themed levels were added. However, some previous features were lost. While the extended version of the &quot;New Junk City&quot; level from the &quot;Special Edition&quot; is included, &quot;Big Bruty&quot; (&quot;Special Edition&quot; new level) and &quot;Who Turned Out the Lights?&quot; (secret level from the original release) are not present. It was later released as a download for the Nintendo DSi as DSiWare, which is also downloadable on the Nintendo 3DS system. The only new addition for the DSiWare version was an extra minigame that involved the player using the system&#x27;s camera on their own face, in order to mimic the same faces Jim would make on-screen. The Gameloft remake was also later released digitally on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network as &quot;Earthworm Jim HD&quot;. It featured a comic book-like introduction, three new computer-themed bonus levels, and a 4-player multiplayer mode with special levels based on already existing ones.

==Reception==
The game received a positive reception upon release. &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; was awarded Best Genesis Game of 1994 by &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, &quot;GamePro&quot; gave the Genesis version a perfect score, and &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; scored the Super Famicom version of the game a 30 out of 40.

The game has been noted for its fluid animation, featuring a hand-drawn style that was unusual for 16-bit releases. &quot;GamePro&quot; argued that the game has &quot;the most innovative gameplay since Sonic first raced onto the Genesis&quot;, backing up the point by noting &quot;In the first level, New Junk City, Jim leaps off old tires, climbs strange crevices and cliffs, swings from chains, and creeps through a maze of garbage - and that&#x27;s the most traditional level in the game!&quot; &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave rave reviews for both the Genesis and Super NES versions, praising animations, long levels, and a warped sense of humor. One of their reviewers summarized that &quot;This game was made by a gamer, and it shows.&quot; Regarding the game&#x27;s overall appeal, a review from GameZone stated &quot;Back when platformers were the king of genres, &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; made its presence known as the &#x27;cool kid on the block&#x27; by appealing to many demographics. Obtaining a moderate difficulty level and establishing itself with stylish humor, &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; was a financial and critical success for Interplay and Shiny Entertainment. Even though I feel the sequel is the best of the series, the original still is able to stand out on its own.&quot; The review also went on to praise the soundtrack from Mark Miller as well. &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the Genesis version of the game, and stated that &quot;Sure, it&#x27;s only a slick 16bit platform game. And anyone looking for anything revolutionary will be disappointed - there&#x27;s nothing strictly &quot;new&quot; here. But it&#x27;s a whole load of fun, and &quot;that&quot;″s what counts.&quot;

The Sega CD enhanced port was also well received. &quot;GamePro&quot; and &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; remarked that whereas most Sega CD ports simply add enhanced music, &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; included many worthwhile additions such as new animations, new levels, and the new homing missile weapon.

&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; reviewed that the Game Gear version has impressive graphics by portable standards, but is crippled by the Game Gear&#x27;s limited two-button control, frequent screen blurring, and frustrating difficulty. &quot;GamePro&quot; also felt the two-button control to be a serious problem, but concluded the Game Gear version to be &quot;Overall ... fine for fans who want to take their EWJ show on the road.&quot;

Reviewing the Windows 95 version, &quot;Maximum&quot; claimed &quot;it&#x27;s not only a damn fine platform game, it&#x27;s probably the best the PC has seen to date.&quot; They particularly praised the non-frustrating challenge and the strong personality of the graphics. &quot;Computer Game Review&quot; remarked, &quot;If you found &quot;&quot; entertaining, you&#x27;ll want to check this one out.&quot; &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot; named the computer release of &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; the best arcade title of 1995.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the Sega CD version of &quot;Earthworm Jim: Special Edition&quot;, and stated that &quot;While a prepackaged, presold character, who&#x27;s as cynically calculated for hip success as Earthworm Jim does rub us the wrong way, we admit there was a cracking good game to back him up, and this new CD version is even better.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the game an A and wrote that the game is too similar to the Genesis and Super NES versions to warrant a new purchase.

However, later Gameloft remakes of the games received mixed reviews. Reception for the 2010 remake, &quot;Earthworm Jim HD&quot;, was less positive. IGN and GameSpot both said the surreal art style and animation stood the test of time, but felt some gameplay aspects and controls were dated in comparison to modern platformers. Similarly, the iPhone version of the game was criticized for its sloppy controls, mostly due to being touchscreen only.

The game sold more than 1 million copies by 1995.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the Game Boy Advance version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that &quot;Luckily, aside from some cheap hits, missed dodges, and blind jumps, everything else is pretty fun.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; was rated the 114th-best game made on a Nintendo System in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;&#x27;s Top 200 Games list. &quot;EGM&quot; gave it their &quot;Game of the Month&quot; award, and &quot;GamePro&quot; later awarded it Best Sega CD Game of 1995. In 2018, Complex rated the game 54th on their The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time writing: &quot;Earthworm Jim was unlike any other game out there at the time, and it’s still quite original today. Its weird, surreal storyline was only made all the better by the solid platforming and shooting that went on here. We still love Earthworm Jim. Ga-roo-vy!&quot; In 2017, Gamesradar ranked the game 19th on their &quot;Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time.&quot; They felt that the game&#x27;s free-form shooting and platforming kept it fresh and relevant and called it &quot;a jolly side-scrolling adventure&quot;. IGN listed Earthworm Jim 57th in their &quot;Top 100 SNES Games of All Time.&quot; In 1995, Total! ranked the game 14th in its Top 100 SNES Games saying: &quot;The game reeks of quality, plays like a dream, is hilariously funny and is packed with more original touches than anyone would have thought possible.&quot; In the same year, &quot;Flux&quot; magazine placed &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; 7th on its Top 100 Video Games. They praised the game writing: &quot;Intensely great gameplay. Wiggy, hilarious animation. Complex, richly rendered backgrounds.&quot;

==Legacy==
A sequel, &quot;Earthworm Jim 2&quot;, was released in 1995. It was released in the same manner as the original; first on the Sega Genesis, and then ported to many other systems. It too was generally well received. Two further games, &quot;Earthworm Jim 3D&quot; for the Nintendo 64 and PC, and &quot;Earthworm Jim: Menace 2 the Galaxy&quot; for the Game Boy Color, were produced in 1999. However, they were developed without the involvement of Shiny Entertainment and were mostly met with negative reviews. An enhanced remake, &quot;Earthworm Jim PSP&quot;, by Atari was planned for a 2007 release for the PlayStation Portable, but was ultimately cancelled.

The game also inspired non-video game products, such as the &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; television series, a comic book series, and a line of action figures. Earthworm Jim is playable as a standard character in &quot;ClayFighter 63⅓&quot;, and as a secret character in the &quot;Sculptor&#x27;s Cut&quot; version of that game.

<doc id="113195" wikidata="Q1538940" url="?curid=113195" title="Lillehammer affair">
<text>The Lillehammer affair (, &quot;Parshat Lillehammer&quot;, Norwegian: &quot;Lillehammer-saken&quot;) was the murder of Ahmed Bouchikhi, a Moroccan waiter and the brother of the French musician Chico Bouchikhi, by Mossad agents in Lillehammer, Norway, on 21 July 1973. The Israeli agents had mistaken their target for Ali Hassan Salameh, the chief of operations for Black September. Six of 15 of the Mossad team were captured and convicted of complicity in the killing by the Norwegian justice system in a major blow to the intelligence agency&#x27;s reputation.

==Background==
Undercover agents had been sent by Israel as part of series of planned assassinations following the 1972 Munich massacre to assassinate Ali Hassan Salameh, the head of Force 17 and an operative of the Black September Organization, the Palestinian militant group responsible. In the summer of 1973, Mossad received a tip that Salameh was working as a waiter in Lillehammer. Author and former Mossad katsa (case officer) Victor Ostrovsky wrote that Salameh was instrumental in leading Mossad off course by feeding it false information about his whereabouts. A team of 15 Mossad agents was sent to Lillehammer to assassinate him, where they were joined by Mossad director general Zvi Zamir and operation commander Michael Harari. Lillehammer was a relatively small city, and the sudden arrival of more than a dozen strangers attracted attention from residents. The local police began to watch them.

A known Palestinian courier in Lillehammer was identified and followed by Mossad agents to a public swimming pool, where he was seen speaking with Bouchikhi, who had no connection to Palestinian armed groups and whose conversation with the courier was coincidental. Bouchikhi, who resembled Salameh, was found to match the photographs of Salameh. A female Mossad agent then jumped into the pool and got close enough to Bouchikhi to hear him speaking French. The agents knew that Salameh was multilingual, and concluded that this had to be him. The Mossad team followed Bouchikhi to his home. His residence was placed under constant surveillance by Mossad agents sitting in hired cars.

==Assassination==
On the evening of 21 July, a day after having misidentified Bouchikhi as Salameh, the Mossad agents carried out the assassination. Bouchikhi and his pregnant wife had gone to see a movie. After taking a bus back and getting off at a bus stop, they began slowly walking back home. As they were in sight of their home, a car with four Mossad agents pulled up beside them. While two stayed in the car to provide cover, the other two got out and shot Bouchikhi 13 times with a 22 caliber pistol, his wife witnessing the shooting. They then jumped back into the car, which immediately drove away at high speed. Local police were close by, but by the time police and rescue arrived, Bouchikhi was dead.

The killing shocked the residents of Lillehammer, where there had not been a murder for 36 years. The Israelis learned that they had killed the wrong man after the story was publicized the following day. Nine members of the hit team, including the two actual killers, escaped and had left Norway by the day following the assassination. Six other members of the team, four men and two women, were arrested before they could escape. Two agents were caught in a getaway car they were using again without having changed the license plates while trying to get to an airport the day after the assassination. Their interrogations led to the arrests of the remaining members of the cell. Incriminating documents and the keys to a network of safe houses were discovered.

While the defence counsel said their clients played only minor roles such as shadowing and passing on information, five of the six agents were found guilty on a variety of charges and convicted of complicity in the killing, receiving sentences ranging from one year to five and a half years but were released and returned to Israel in 1975. The Mossad later found Ali Hassan Salameh in Beirut and killed him on 22 January 1979 with a remote-controlled car bomb in an attack that also caused the deaths of eight other persons (including four of Salameh’s bodyguards) and injured 18 others.

==Later developments==
The revelations of the captured agents dealt a massive blow to the secret infrastructure of the Mossad in Europe. The captured agents were interrogated over the operation. One of them, Dan Arbel, became extremely nervous as soon as his cell door shut due to his extreme claustrophobia; he provided many details on the operation in exchange for being transferred to a larger cell with a small window. Authorities discovered a key on one of the suspects for a Mossad safe house in Paris. It was handed over to the French police, who raided the flat and discovered keys to other Mossad safe houses in the city, along with evidence that several of those involved in the Lillehammer operation had been involved in other assassinations as part of Mossad assassinations following the Munich massacre. Information on Mossad safe houses, phone numbers and agents gathered during the interrogation of the agents was rapidly shared with its European counterparts. As a result, Mossad agents who had been exposed had to be recalled, safe houses abandoned, phone numbers changed and operational methods modified.

For the first time, clear evidence had been found of Israel&#x27;s involvement in the string of assassinations of Palestinians that had taken place on European soil as part of Operation Wrath of God. Under intense international pressure, Golda Meir ordered the operation suspended. It was resumed under Prime Minister Menachem Begin.

Israel never officially took responsibility for the assassination. In January 1996, Prime Minister Shimon Peres said that Israel would never take responsibility for the killing but would consider compensation. The Government of Israel appointed an attorney, Amnon Goldenberg, to negotiate a settlement with Bouchikhi&#x27;s widow Torill and daughter Malika, who were represented by attorney Thor-Erik Johansen. That same month, an agreement was reached; Israel paid compensation equal to US$283,000 split between Bouchikhi&#x27;s wife and daughter. A separate settlement of US$118,000 was paid to a son from a previous marriage. An Israeli statement was also issued which stopped short of an apology but expressed &quot;sorrow&quot; over Bouchikhi&#x27;s &quot;unfortunate&quot; death.

In 1990, Norway reopened the case. In 1998 it issued a global arrest warrant for the leader of the operation, Michael Harari, who had successfully escaped, but closed the case the following year after judging that it would be impossible to get a conviction. According to the September 2004 book release of &quot;Mange liv&quot; (English: &quot;Many lives&quot;) by the former lawyer Annæus Schjødt, who represented two of the agents in the case and later married one of them (Sylvia Raphael), information about the Israeli nuclear weapons program was leaked to the Government of Norway by one of the arrested agents, Dan Arbel. However, the Norwegians decided to remain silent about their findings.

<text>Polar Air Cargo Worldwide Inc. is a cargo airline based in Purchase, New York, United States. It operates scheduled all-cargo services to North America, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. Its main base is Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, with hubs at Los Angeles International Airport, Hong Kong International Airport, Narita International Airport and Incheon International Airport near Seoul, South Korea. Polar&#x27;s parent company is Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and DHL has a 49% equity interest in the airline.

== History ==
Polar was formed in 1993 as a joint venture between Southern Air Transport and GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS). It started operations in June 1993 and began with charter flights, later adding scheduled services. During 1994, Polar was certified as a supplemental air carrier by the Federal Aviation Administration and on 4 July 1994 as a US all-cargo carrier by the United States Department of Transportation. After several years of continued growth, the remainder of the company was acquired by GECAS. 

In November 2001, Polar was acquired by Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings (AAWW), whose Atlas Air subsidiary is a provider of ACMI (aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance) freighter leasing. Polar became the scheduled service provider for AAWW, while Atlas continued to supply Boeing 747-400 freighters on a wet-lease basis to major airlines. In October 2006, it was announced that DHL Express would be acquiring a 49% stake in Polar. , Polar is still majority-owned by Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings (51%) and has 736 employees.

In April 2023, former Polar Air Cargo COO Lars Winkelbauer was arrested in Thailand and charged, along with 10 others, with defrauding the company of an estimated $52m.

In February 2025, Atlas Air and DHL announced that Polar Air Cargo would be dissolved, with the 4 747-8s and 2 777Fs in Polar’s fleet continuing to be operated by Atlas.
