<text>McHenry is a city in McHenry County, Illinois, United States. It is located about 55 miles northwest of Chicago. Per the 2020 census, the population was 27,135. McHenry was at one time the county seat of McHenry County, which once included adjoining Lake County to the east.

It rests at an elevation of 797 feet and the Fox River flows through the eastern portion of the city. It is surrounded by natural lakes and streams, grassy moraine hills, gravel banks and shallow nutrient-rich peat bogs, remnants of receding glaciers from the last ice age. Moraine Hills State Park, Glacial Park Conservation Area, and Volo Bog State Natural Area preserve some of these natural features.

==History==
=== 19th century ===
In the 1830s various settlers arrived in the area and created the foundation for McHenry. Some of the family names can still be seen today: McCullom, McLean, Boone, and Wheeler.

George Gage came to the area in 1835 and purchased a plot of land west of the Fox River. This area eventually came to be known as Gagetown. In 1854, George Gage played an instrumental role in bringing the railroad to the city. Gagetown was eventually renamed to West McHenry.

In 1851, a dam was built on Boone Creek which created Mill Pond. The pond encompassed an area between today&#x27;s rail road tracks and Route 31 and north of Waukegan Road.

In 1860, the historical Count&#x27;s House was completed.

On August 4, 1875, the first issue of the city newspaper, the &quot;McHenry Plaindealer&quot;, was published by Jay Van Slyke.

=== 20th century ===

On March 30, 1908 a train bound for Ringwood crashed near the McHenry train depot. One person was killed.

In 1929, Mill Pond was drained by removing the dam on Boone Creek.

The original single lane Pearl Street bridge was built 1880-1881 over Fox River. The iron truss bridge was dismantled and a section of it was relocated to Terra Cotta Industries in Crystal Lake in Nov. 1976 to be used as a pedestrian bridge. Other sections remain in storage. The original bridge was replaced with a concrete bridge.

In 1985, the &quot;McHenry Plaindealer&quot; newspaper became part of the &quot;Northwest Herald&quot;.

<text>Richmond is a village in McHenry County, Illinois, United States, 65 miles northwest of Chicago. It is a commuter village within the Chicago metropolitan area. The population was 2,089 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Carpenter William A. McConnell was Richmond&#x27;s first settler, arriving in 1837 and erecting the village&#x27;s first building, a log structure. Eight other settlers arrived in 1838 and growth progressed rapidly after that point. The first school was built on McConnell&#x27;s farm in 1841 and in 1844 the village was finally platted. The village was named after Richmond, Vermont, the native home of a first settler. McConnell and Dr. R.R. Stone established a cheese factory in Richmond, and a creamery, other cheese factories, a box factory, a wagon works and a pickle factory followed.

Most of Richmond&#x27;s original buildings were built from the mid-1840s through the 1860s and consisted of Greek Revival rural farmhouse and Richmond&#x27;s commercial district. Houses within the village were built mostly in the Greek Revival style as well with later prominent homes cast in the Italianate or Second Empire styles. The village of Richmond was officially incorporated in 1872.

On Christmas Eve 1902 a devastating fire swept through most of Richmond&#x27;s commercial district destroying 20 buildings. The fire was a setback for Richmond&#x27;s economic growth as most of the buildings were either uninsured or underinsured. Many business owners did not bother to rebuild at all following the fire. Another building spurt did occur in Richmond between 1903 and 1905.

Richmond was the site for the Chicago Super and Sprint Weekend event, June 11–12, 2017, part of the Reebok Spartan Race.

==Geography==
Richmond is located at (42.471868, -88.307431).

According to the 2010 census, Richmond has a total area of , all land.

The small village was platted in 1854, allowing the installation of roads, infrastructure, public amenities and allowing residents to legally own plots of land for agricultural use, and the construction of homes and businesses. In an attempt to maintain its small-town environment, Ringwood was incorporated as a Village on November 15, 1994. By 2018, the Village of Ringwood had two paid staff, plus contracted services including building inspection, and an unsalaried Board of Trustees.

<text>Trout Valley is a village in McHenry County, Illinois, United States. It was incorporated as a village on March 19, 1996. Per the 2020 census, the population was 515.

== History ==
Maxon Community Developers of Barrington, Illinois, founders and developers of nearby Streamwood, Barrington Woods, Brigadoon, and later Green Valley, Arizona purchased the Curtiss Candy Farms in 1952 from Otto Schnering, founder of the Curtiss Candy Company. The brothers Norm and Don Maxon promptly renamed it Trout Valley after Norman&#x27;s passion for fly fishing.

The estate was once the private estate of John D. Hertz of Hertz Car Rentals, modeled during the gilded age after English estates complete with riding stables, polo grounds, trout fishing and pheasant hunting. Norman Maxon, an avid outdoorsman, reestablished the trout hatchery and approached National Homes of Lafayette, Indiana to develop Trout Valley as a national showcase for their modular homes. By 1956, Trout Valley won the National Home development of the year and the concept of a homeowners association was conceived by C.E.O. Don Maxon as a way to maintain the integrity of Trout Valley.

Trout Valley was once part of unincorporated McHenry County until it became its own village. The residents attend schools in the Cary School District, and the village itself does not have any of its own schools, fire department, or police department. The land was once a farm owned by John D. Hertz and still contains residual structures from that period of time.

At the west side of the village, a magnificent arched set of iron gates with stone pillars mark the entrance at Cary-Algonquin Road. These were probably erected by Mr. Hertz in the 1920s. In 2006, this entrance was designated as a local landmark by the McHenry County Historic Preservation Commission. This protects and preserves the gates by an ordinance enacted by the McHenry County Board.

The first mayor of Trout Valley was Steve Barrett.

==Geography==
Trout Valley is located at (42.199265, -88.253357).

According to the 2010 census, Trout Valley has a total area of , of which (or 99.54%) is land and (or 0.46%) is water. There are various small ponds with streams that connect them. The village rests against the Fox River.

<text>Woodstock is a city in and the county seat of McHenry County, Illinois, United States. It is located 51 miles northwest of Chicago, making it one of the city&#x27;s outer-most suburbs. Per the 2020 census, the population was 25,630.

In 2007 Woodstock was named one of the nation&#x27;s Dozen Distinctive Destinations by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

==History==

=== Early days, Centerville ===
Woodstock was originally known as Centerville because of its location at the geographic center of McHenry County. It was chosen as the county seat on September 4, 1843. Early settler Alvin Judd developed a plat for the town, which incorporated a two-acre public square, near which a 2-story frame courthouse and jail were constructed the following year by George C. Dean and Daniel Blair.

In 1845, prominent resident Joel Johnson proposed that Centerville be given a more original name, and the town was renamed Woodstock after Johnson&#x27;s hometown of Woodstock, Vermont. The town was still listed as &quot;Center&quot; on the 1850 Federal Census. In 1852, Woodstock was incorporated as a village with Judd as president. In response to a growing population following the end of the Civil War, Woodstock was incorporated as a city in 1873.

John S. Wheat was elected as Woodstock&#x27;s first mayor. A vital artery for the growing town was the train line to and from Chicago, which allowed for a substantial industrial presence early in the town&#x27;s history.

=== Eugene V. Debs&#x27; prison stay ===
In 1895, Eugene V. Debs served a short federal prison sentence in the Woodstock Jail following the 1894 Pullman labor strike in Chicago. Debs, the former president of the American Railway Union, was held in Woodstock instead of Chicago because federal officials feared that he would be surrounded with too many sympathizers in a Chicago prison and therefore could have still incited further unrest. Debs was instead assigned to a cell in the newly constructed Woodstock Jail, which occupied the lowest floor of the Woodstock Courthouse on the town square.

During his time in the jail, Debs received several influential socialist visitors and encountered the works of Karl Marx. He is said to have considered the Woodstock Jail one of the &quot;greatest school[s],&quot; and passed his time reading and writing many letters from his cell. By the time he was released in November 1895 (to great fanfare and before crowds of onlookers assembled in the Woodstock Square), Debs had become a socialist and a national celebrity. He later ran for the United States Presidency five times between 1900 and 1920 as the candidate for the newly formed Social Democratic Party.

=== &quot;Typewriter City&quot; ===
During the early part of the 20th century, Woodstock had become &quot;Typewriter City&quot; and was home to factories of both the Emerson Typewriter Company and the Oliver Typewriter Company. Woodstock workers had built more than half the world&#x27;s typewriters by 1922. The companies were very much a part of civic life in Woodstock during this time. Both factories had active social clubs, baseball teams that competed against one another, and Emerson had a well-regarded band that played at public events.

In 1919, Emerson Typewriter became the Woodstock Typewriter Company. The city grew and flourished with increasing demand for Woodstock typewriters through and after World War II. Initially the company sold typewriters for use in the war effort both domestically and abroad, but after the war&#x27;s end returning servicemen, now familiar with the Woodstock brand, chose these models for their households. The factory was in use until 1970, and has since been converted into lofts.

=== Orson Welles and the Todd School for Boys ===
Woodstock had an important role in the creative development of Orson Welles. In 1926, in the midst of a chaotic upbringing, he enrolled at the Todd School for Boys in Woodstock at age 10. His five-year stay there was his only formal education, and the town and school made an impression on the young Welles. Years later, in 1960, when asked where he thought of as his hometown, he replied &quot;I suppose it&#x27;s Woodstock, Illinois, if it&#x27;s anywhere. I went to school there for four years. If I try to think of a home, it&#x27;s that.&quot;

At Todd School, the young Welles came under the positive influence and guidance of Roger Hill, a teacher who later became the school&#x27;s headmaster. Hill provided Welles with an educational environment that supported his creativity, allowing Welles to concentrate on subjects that interested him. Welles performed and staged his first theatrical experiments and productions at Todd. He also performed at the downtown Woodstock Opera House, where the stage — the site of his American debut as a professional theatre director — is now dedicated to him.

Welles returned to Woodstock periodically after leaving school. In July 1934 at the age of 19, he coordinated the Todd Theatre Festival, a six-week summer festival at the Woodstock Opera House that featured Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir of Dublin&#x27;s Gate Theatre. His short film &quot;The Hearts of Age&quot; was shot on the Todd School campus during the festival.

Todd School for Boys closed in 1954. Several original buildings were purchased at auction and reused by Marian Central Catholic High School and Christian Life Services. Welles&#x27; former dormitory was demolished in 2010.

==Roles in popular media==
=== &quot;Planes, Trains and Automobiles&quot;, 1987 ===
Several scenes in the 1987 film &quot;Planes, Trains, and Automobiles&quot; were shot in Woodstock, including the scene in which the protagonists&#x27; rental car is towed in front of a building, the old Courthouse. The movie brought Woodstock to the attention of location manager Bob Hudgins, who later recommended the town to Harold Ramis for the filming of &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;.

===&quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, 1993===
Woodstock is perhaps most famous for its role as the location for the 1993 movie &quot;Groundhog Day,&quot; starring Bill Murray. Although the story is set in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, the movie&#x27;s producers preferred the quintessentially American, but non-specific backdrop of Woodstock Square and its surroundings. Outdoor and street scenes were filmed around the downtown and various side streets, and signs from stores and businesses are visible throughout the movie.

Many notable scenes&#x27; locations are commemorated with plaques as part of a walking tour for visitors and enthusiasts.
In January 2020, several key actors, including Bill Murray, Brian Doyle-Murray and Stephen Tobolowsky returned to Woodstock to film a &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;-themed commercial for Jeep. The commercial aired during the 2020 Super Bowl.

===Other===
Woodstock was the basis for the fictional town of Hawkins Falls in the 1950s television soap opera &quot;Hawkins Falls, Population 6200&quot;. The city was the site of primary filming for the movie &quot;Bored Silly&quot;, which was released in 2000. In August 2018, it was reported that filming had begun in and around the Square for the 2019 HBO series &quot;Lovecraft Country&quot; from producers J. J. Abrams, Jordan Peele, Misha Green and Ben Stephenson. A map of Woodstock can be seen on the splash screen for The Jackbox Party Pack 4 game Civic Doodle where the historic square and Illinois route 47 and 120 are clearly visible.

In September 2021, a second commercial began filming in Woodstock, including the Woodstock Square and the surrounding areas, for Toyota, which began airing on television later that December.

Woodstock was also a primary filming location for the Amazon series Night Sky doubling as the fictional Farnsworth, Illinois.

== Local culture ==
=== Local newspaper ===
&quot;The Woodstock Independent&quot; is the award-winning local paper of record and is delivered weekly to subscribers. Published on Wednesdays, &quot;The Independent&quot; covers community news, events as well as local government and schools. &quot;The Independent&quot; also publishes &quot;The Torch&quot;, a feature-oriented magazine delivered free to all Woodstock residents 8 or 9 times a year.

=== Music ===
Woodstock has become an important destination for live music in McHenry County and the region with venues featuring local, national, and international artists.

A number of organizations support and promote live music in Woodstock:
* Liquid Blues
* Jazz on the Square
* Off Square Music
* Opera Woodstock
* RIFF Productions
* Woodstock Folk Festival
* Woodstock City Band
* Potts &amp; Pans Steelband

=== Religion ===
Woodstock is home to many Protestant and Catholic churches, a Jewish congregation and The Blue Lotus Buddhist Temple since 2002.

==Education==

Woodstock&#x27;s public schools are part of Woodstock Community Unit School District 200, which was formed in 1969. The district operates 1 early learning center (Verda Dierzen), 6 elementary schools (Dean Street, Greenwood, Mary Endres, Olson, Prairiewood and Westwood), two middle schools (Northwood and Creekside) and two high schools (Woodstock High School and Woodstock North High School). The three newest buildings, Prairiewood, Creekside and WNHS, were approved in a March 2006 referendum to address crowding in schools due to the area&#x27;s growth between the mid-1990s and 2008.

Woodstock is served by private educational institutions: St. Mary Catholic grade school (K-8) is located in town. Students often continue on to Marian Central Catholic High School, also located in Woodstock.

Residents pursuing an associate degree normally do so at McHenry County College in neighboring Crystal Lake. Loyola University Chicago owns and operates a large property on Woodstock&#x27;s eastern edge as its Retreat and Ecology Campus. Aurora University also operates its Woodstock Center downtown.

==Economy==
===Top employers===
According to Woodstock&#x27;s 2018 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:

==Transportation==
=== Public transit ===
Woodstock&#x27;s railroad station is the penultimate passenger stop on Metra&#x27;s Union Pacific Northwest Line, which originates from Ogilvie Transportation Center in downtown Chicago and ends in Harvard, Illinois. At Woodstock, Metra offers passengers 14 daily trains to Chicago on weekdays, with 13 returning outbound. Between 400 and 500 passengers use the train daily for travel to Chicago or other suburban communities along the line.

This direct link to the city was historically instrumental in Woodstock&#x27;s growth as a city, and remains an attractive option for local commuters and residents to reach Chicago. As a result, Woodstock&#x27;s use of the system is greater than that of nearly half of the Metra system&#x27;s other outlying stations, many of which serve larger or geographically nearer communities.

Other public ground transportation is limited to Pace bus route 807, which connects downtown Woodstock with downtown McHenry.

=== Major roads ===
U.S. Route 14 once took drivers through the heart of downtown Woodstock, but a bypass now curves around the city&#x27;s southwest border. Illinois Route 47 runs through the city in the north–south direction. Illinois Route 120&#x27;s western terminus is in northwest Woodstock, and continues east past Woodstock&#x27;s downtown and into rural McHenry County.

<text>Anchor is a village in McLean County, Illinois, United States. The population was 163 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Bloomington–Normal Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Anchor is in eastern McLean County, south of Illinois Route 165. Bloomington, the county seat, is to the west, and Sibley is to the east in Ford County.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Anchor has a total area of , all land. The village drains south toward the Mackinaw River, a west-flowing tributary of the Illinois River.

==History==
Anchor was laid out on April 28, 1880, by Daniel B. Stewart (1837 – 1920). Stewart was a large landowner in the area. He was born in New York and had come to Illinois in the early 1860s. With others Stewart donated $10,000 to build ten miles of the railroad. The town was created when the Clinton Bloomington and Northeastern Railroad was built. Colfax, Cropsey and Cooksville were laid out at the same time. This railroad was soon absorbed by the Illinois Central. The first trains passed through the town on July 4, 1880. The town takes its name from Anchor Township; early McLean County historians wrote that they did not know the source of the name Anchor.

The original town of Anchor was a rectangle extending on both sides of a diagonal track with no widening of the track as was commonly found at such towns. A small triangular block north of the railroad was designated as Depot Park. The depot itself was on the north side of the tracks, and the two elevators were on the south side. Most of the early commercial buildings were on the north side of Second Street, which was north of the tracks. By 1895 there was a brickyard on the southwest edge of the town and next to it was a coal shaft, but it is not clear if the shaft was ever finished. There were also a handful of stores and the Morris Hotel.

<text>Arrowsmith is a village in McLean County, Illinois, United States. The population was 276 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Bloomington–Normal Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Arrowsmith is in eastern McLean County, east of Bloomington, the county seat, and west of Gibson City.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Arrowsmith has a total area of , all land. The village drains east and west to tributaries of the Sangamon River in its upper, east-flowing course. The village is part of the Illinois River watershed.

==History==

===Founding of Arrowsmith===
Arrowsmith was laid out on December 7, 1871, by Charles W. Holder (1808–1887) and Owen T. Reeves (1829- ?). The founders kept their identities hidden for two years until the plat was officially recorded. Both proprietors lived in Bloomington, were experienced land dealers, and were involved in the creation of the Lafayette Bloomington and Muncie Railroad. Holder had been Jesse Fell&#x27;s partner in the founding of Towanda, Illinois, was one of his partners in the development of Normal, Illinois, and the town of Holder, Illinois, would soon be named in his honor. Reeves was a Bloomington lawyer and judge who had been colonel of the short-lived 70th Illinois Infantry during the Civil War. Arrowsmith Township had voted $30,000 in bonds to support the construction of the railroad on the condition that a station be established in their township. It was at first thought that the name of the town would be Weldon, but it was soon learned that this name had been taken by a newly founded town in DeWitt County. Arrowsmith takes its name from the township in which it was located, which had been named for early settler Ezekiel Arrowsmith. Several of the first buildings in Arrowsmith were moved to the new town from Senex, located about three miles to the southwest near the edge of Old Town Timber. Taking advantage of cold weather, John Thompson had used 32 horses to skid his store from Senex to Arrowsmith in just over two hours. The Senex blacksmith shop and the post office were moved in the same year. However, most of the buildings in the new town were newly constructed, and many of the early merchants were from places other than Senex.

===Original town design and development===
The design of the original town was centered on a wide railroad ground, with eight blocks north of the tracks and eight blocks south of the tracks. Most of the early businesses were along Main Street north of the tracks. Both grain elevators and the early stockyards were north of the tracks, but the depot was on the south side. In 1876 the Lafayette Bloomington and Muncie Railroad was leased to the Lake Erie and Western Railroad which purchased the line in 1879, and the railroad is usually remembered under this name. Arrowsmith was incorporated as a village in April 1890. The growth of Arrowsmith was slow; in 1900 it had only 317 people.

<text>Bellflower is a village in McLean County, Illinois, United States. The population was 346 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Bloomington–Normal Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Bellflower is in southeastern McLean County, along Illinois Route 54, which leads southwest to Farmer City and northeast to Gibson City. Bloomington, the McLean county seat, is to the northwest, while Champaign is to the southeast.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Bellflower has a total area of , all land. The village drains southeast to tributaries of Lone Tree Creek, a northeast-flowing tributary of the Sangamon River and part of the Illinois River watershed.

Students from Bellflower attend the Blue Ridge School District.

==History==

===Founding===
Bellflower was laid out on August 26, 1871, by George Nelson Black (March 15, 1833 – April 22, 1908) and his wife Louisa J. Black (December 22, 1840 – December 23, 1909). George was born in Berkshire County, Massachusetts, and had come to Springfield, Illinois, in 1850, where he became wealthy through manufacturing, mining, and railroads. Bellflower Township had subscribed $30,000 in twenty-year bonds toward the construction of what was then called the Gilman, Clinton and Springfield Railroad. A condition of the funding was that the township would have a station on the railroad. Black purchased of land, laid out into town lots and then transferred the title to the railroad. When the railroad became property of the Illinois Central Railroad, town lots in Bellflower were not transferred to that railroad. The name of the town came from the name of the township and was selected by Jesse Richards, who was particularly fond of the Bellflower apple. It is perhaps the only town in Illinois named for an apple. In the 1870s it was often spelled &quot;Belle Flower&quot; or &quot;Belle-Flower&quot;.

===Original plan and growth===
The original plan of the town consisted of two square blocks of land. Most of the western square was divided into sixteen blocks, each usually containing twelve lots, and this part of the town was split diagonally by the path of the railroad. Unlike many towns found in the 1870s, there was no depot ground. The eastern square of land and a strip along the north edge of the western square was divided into out lots, each of which were several times the size the lots in the western square. The combination of in lots and out lots was fairly common in central Illinois and may be found, for example, at Hudson and Chenoa. The small triangle of land cut off by the railroad from the remainder of block ten became the location of the town jail. The station was located on the south side of the tracks, and the two early elevators were on railroad land. By 1895 both in lots and out lots held residences. R. E. Moreland established the first business. Bellflower quickly became a major grain shipping center serving the fertile surrounding land. By 1879 it was shipping over 350,000 bushels of grain a year. In 1900 the population was 356, nearly the same as today.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 408 people, 162 households, and 117 families residing in the village. The population density was . There were 171 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the village was 100.00% White.

The average household size was 2.52 and the average family size was 3.01.

In the village, the population was spread out, with 24.8% under the age of 18, 7.8% from 18 to 24, 28.2% from 25 to 44, 23.3% from 45 to 64, and 15.9% who were 65 years of age or older.

<text>Bloomington is a city in and the county seat of McLean County, Illinois, United States. The 2020 census showed the city had a population of 78,680, making it the 13th-most populous city in Illinois and the fifth-most populous outside the Chicago metropolitan area. It is adjacent to the town of Normal, and is the more populous of the two principal municipalities of the Bloomington–Normal metropolitan area, which has a population of roughly 170,000. Bloomington is southwest of Chicago and northeast of St. Louis. Bloomington is home to Illinois Wesleyan University and the headquarters for State Farm and Country Financial. Bloomington is also home to the minor league hockey team Bloomington Bison.

==History==

The Bloomington area was at the edge of a large grove occupied by the Kickapoo people before the first Euro-American settlers arrived in the early 1820s. Springing from the settlement of &quot;Keg Grove,&quot; later called &quot;Blooming Grove,&quot; Bloomington was named as county seat on December 25, 1830, when McLean County was created.

When the County of McLean was incorporated, a county seat was established, but the legislation stated the site of Bloomington &quot;would be located later.&quot; Gavin Quinn, one of the new county&#x27;s promoters, offered to donate of his land for the new town. His offer was accepted, and Bloomington was laid out. Its lots were sold at a well-attended and noisy auction on July 4, 1831. At this time there were few roads, but rich soils brought new farmers who began commerce by conducting their business in the county. People came from all over to trade and do business at the town&#x27;s center, known today as Downtown Bloomington, including Abraham Lincoln, who worked as a lawyer in nearby Springfield. Prominent Bloomington resident Jesse W. Fell, who founded the &quot;Bloomington Pantagraph&quot; and was most prominent in local real estate, had suggested the Lincoln-Douglas debates in 1854 and played a prominent role in pushing Lincoln to run for president.

In 1900, an officer on patrol discovered a fire in a laundry across the street from the old city hall and police station.

<text>Carlock is a village in McLean County, Illinois, United States. The population was 548 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Bloomington–Normal Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

===Oak Grove and Carlock===
Carlock was laid out on January 5, 1888, by John Franklin Carlock. Mr. Carlock owned of land. One tract was used to plat the original village of Carlock. It was located south of the hard road, Route 9 (now U.S. Route 150), connecting Bloomington and Peoria. It was one of the last towns platted in McLean County. Just northeast of the present location of Carlock the main road from Bloomington to Peoria, which was locally known as the Old Trail passed or the Old Peoria Trail, ascended a low range of wooded hills. This location had long been of interest to townsite developers. The first attempt was made by local farmer John McGee, who in 1838 laid out the town of Livingston; it consisted of seven blocks and a town square. Livingston was a total failure. McGee was unable to sell a single lot. The second attempt at town founding was more successful. By the 1850s a small cluster of houses and stores had begun to cluster just west of McGee&#x27;s townsite. In 1866 a post office was established with the name Oak Grove. On July 17, 1879, an official town plat was filed. Soon there were about twenty dwellings, a large town hall, two general stores, a blacksmith shop, a steam-driven mill, a harness and shoe shop, and a brass band. One reporter wrote that all the town needed &quot;is a railroad&quot;.

===The town moves down hill===
By March 1887 it was clear that a railroad would pass nearby, and local people were denying rumors that their town would be picked up bodily and carried to the railroad. The people at Oak Grove sent a delegation to Bloomington to explain to the superintendent of the Lake Erie and Western Railroad the reasons for putting a station at Oak Grove; his reply was not encouraging. Then local farmer John Franklin Carlock, who also had a contract to supply the railroad with oak ties, laid out a new town about a mile and a half away. In November 1879 it was announced that the town movers had arrived in Oak Grove. Buildings were placed on skids and hauled down the hill to the site of Carlock. By February 1888 residents were moving into their newly re-located homes. In June 1888 the Oak Grove correspondent of &quot;The Pantagraph&quot; reported that &quot;nothing is left of our town but pieces&quot;. Further west along the same new railroad, other towns were in motion: buildings from Farnisville moved to Congerville, and Chaffers Corners went to the new town of Deer Creek.

===Original design and development of Carlock===
The plan of the original town of Carlock was small and simple. It was a rectangle bisected diagonally into two equal parts by the railroad, with one whole block and two partial blocks on each side of the tracks. There were a total of 85 lots. Most of the businesses were along Perry Street north of the tracks. In 1895 there were about sixty buildings in Carlock; most of these were newly built, and only about twelve had been moved from Oak Grove. Because of the late date at which the town was developed, it did not enjoy the rapid growth of some that were established earlier. Carlock remained a rural service center, grain shipping point, and residential community.

===New subdivisions===
In 2004, the U.S. Department of Agriculture purchased a chunk of land to the northeast of Carlock, off Church Street. This land, which has been incorporated by the village, is being developed as a three-phase subdivision named Stoneman Gardens with approximately 65 lots of and a small park. The houses are built by the future, low-income owners of the homes with the assistance of an organization called YouthBuild McLean County and is financed by the USDA. This effort allows families which otherwise could not afford to move into a new home to do so. Ground was broken in 2005, and as of July 2010 development had begun on the third and easternmost phase which was to include the park and the final grouping of houses. While the subdivision currently has only one access point – Church Street – at least one additional access is planned in order to link directly to US-150 to the south.

Another subdivision named Rock Creek, on the eastern edge of Carlock and bordering US-150 to the north, contained two homes as of mid-2010. There were only three homes as of mid-2013, showing a slow developmental start but leaving many available lots for potential new homes in the next few years.

==Geography==
Carlock is in northwestern McLean County along U.S. Route 150, which passes through the village as East Washington Road and North Bradbury Street. Interstate 74 passes just west of the village limits, with access from Exit 120 (West Washington Street). I-74 and US 150 both lead southeast to Bloomington, the McLean county seat. Peoria is to the northwest via I-74, while US 150, running parallel as a local highway, leads northwest to Congerville.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Carlock has a total area of , all land. Rock Creek runs along the eastern edge of the village, flowing northwest and then west to the Mackinaw River, a west-flowing tributary of the Illinois River.

Carlock and the surrounding areas receive police protection from the McLean County Sheriff&#x27;s Police and the nearby Danvers Police Department for daily patrols, and Fire/EMS coverage from the Carlock Fire Protection District.

==Demographics==

==History==

Founding of Chenoa

The Town of Chenoa was laid out on May 13, 1856, by Matthew T. Scott. At this time the Chicago and Alton Railroad, had been running trains for almost two years, but the survey for the east-west Toledo, Peoria and Oquawka (soon to be the Toledo, Peoria and Western) had not reached McLean County. Scott anticipated the place where the railroads would cross and platted the town which he called Chenoa. Matthew T. Scott (February 24, 1828 - May 21, 1891) was the son of a Kentucky banker and by the time he reached Illinois, was an experienced land developer who led a group of well financed investors. The European settlement history of Chenoa began in 1854 when Matthew T. Scott began buying thousands of acres of land in this area.

The Name Chenoa

There has been much discussion about the meaning of the name Chenoa. Mid-nineteenth century histories explain that it was an Indian word for &quot;Kentucky&quot; and could therefore be rendered as &quot;Dark and Bloody Ground.&quot; Callary makes it clear that this is incorrect and that this meaning is unknown in Kentucky. Others explain that Chenoa is a Cherokee word meaning &quot;Dove&quot; or &quot;White Dove.&quot; Again this is not the case. Dove in Cherokee is &quot;&quot;waya&quot; and white dove &quot;unega waya&quot;.&quot; There is also the often-repeated story that Scott had originally wanted the name to read &quot;Chenowa&quot; but the railroad had mistakenly dropped the letter &quot;w.&quot; This again is not true. The railroad had no say in the naming of Chenoa; the spelling &quot;Chenoa&quot; is exactly how Scott recorded the name when he first laid out the town. However,&quot;Chenoka&quot; or &quot;Chenoa&quot; is one of many Native American names for the Kentucky River and this may explain how Scott got the idea that the word could be translated as Kentucky.

Design of Chenoa

The plan of Chenoa is complex because it is the blending of two rival townsites. Scott&#x27;s original town, which lies west of the railroad, was built around a central park, is much more like the plan like central Illinois towns of the 1830s than that of other towns laid out in the 1850s. However, Scott only owned Section 2, while his rival, and former business companion, William Marshall had purchased Section 1. Marshall&#x27;s land included most of the land east of the railroad; on this land, he laid out a competing town, East Chenoa. Scott did control a small strip between the two towns which he refused to plat out into streets and lots, so anyone who tried to pass the short distance from one town to the other would be guilty of trespass. Scott would call this strip his &quot;imaginary wall,&quot; although it was never a physical barrier. The dual nature of the platting also explains why Chenoa had two distinct streets named Lincoln. Both Scott&#x27;s and Marshall&#x27;s towns were orthogonal grids with north-south and east-west streets, but plan became still more complex when a later addition by Scott included Veto Street, which ran parallel to the railroad and at an odd angle to the earlier streets.

Selling Chenoa

The first advertisement for the town of Chenoa appeared under the bold heading, GREAT SALE OF LOTS IN THE TOWN OF CHENOA, May 15, 1856. The advertisement makes clear the advantages Scott had in mind when he selected the location of the town. It was, he wrote, &quot;The only crossing of railroads likely to be made within McLean County within four or five years, and persons can easily ascertain that the connection of the two roads will be effected by the first of November or December.&quot; He went on to explain that, while there was no large body of timber nearby, coal will be furnished at twelve cents a bushel and cheep lumber, poplar, walnut, and oak will also be brought in by the railroad. This was a particular advantage because &quot;... persons will come from eight or ten miles for these articles, bringing along their grain, making loads with both ways - carrying back coal, sometimes for themselves, again for their neighbors.&quot; If anyone would build a house worth $400 to $500 within six months of buying a lot, they could have two years of credit on the sale price interest free. Scott was willing to take a quarter interest in a steam saw mill and would donate sites for churches, schools and burial grounds. Moreover, anyone who sold liquor in the town would forfeit the title to their property.

Development of Chenoa

The great problem with the development of Chenoa was that, before the town was laid out, there had been no settlement in the surrounding country. The land around Chenoa was prairie wilderness. The Indians who had hunted and lived in Illinois country for many years had been moved by the U. S. Government to regions west of the Mississippi River by the time Chenoa was founded. Soon the tough prairie sod was broken by the plow which made acres and acres of land available for farming. Scott aided the development of nearby land by plowing and cultivating , building two hundred houses, and planting twenty-seven miles of hedge fences. The first structures within the limits of the new town were two little half-sod and half-board dugouts which served as depot, freight house, and shelter for railroad section hands; this is one of the very few mentions of sod houses in McLean County. J. B. Lenney came from Pennsylvania to the new town of Chenoa and in 1855 put up the frame building here which was called &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Store.&quot; J. B. Lenney took an active part in the development of the town and is referred to as the &quot;Father of Chenoa.&quot; In 1856 the National Hotel was constructed. All of these buildings were on the east side of the tracks. In 1864 Chenoa, East Chenoa, and several additions were united under one town government which was confirmed by a special act of the Illinois General Assembly in 1869.

Development continues

Slowly, additional improvements were made. Rectangular blocks of stone were placed at road intersections. Changes in livestock laws made it possible for residents to tear down the wooden fences that had once surrounded every residence. Many trees were planted. The Chicago and Alton was double tracked in 1890. In 1891 the first electric lights were installed. A union station was built so both railroads could share passenger facilities; unfortunately it burned down during Armistice celebrations on November 11, 1918. This was not the towns only serious July 1894 the entire business district town east of the Railroad burned down; very few of the buildings were insured. Railroad traffic peaked in 1911, when twenty-four trains arrived. After that automobile and truck traffic slowly replaced trains and Chenoa became a stop of the fabled Route 66. Two currently active businesses here are notable due to their longevity: Schuirman&#x27;s Drug Store (now Chenoa Pharmacy) and Union Roofing. Several small manufacturers operate here and a number of antique dealers are Chenoa-based. Chenoa was once home to two competing grain elevators. The last one was demolished in late December 2020. Chenoa is now the headquarters of the Bright Stalk Wind Farm.

== Historical landmarks ==

The Matthew T. Scott House was built as a home for Matthew T. Scott, who promoted and developed much of the surrounding area. It is closely associated with many events in the history of Chenoa. What appears today to be one building, is in fact, a blending of two structures. The oldest part is, at the rear of the house, was built in 1855, as a post and beam I-cottage. The more formal front of the house was added in 1863 and is a true balloon frame structure built around a central hall with an impressive staircase. The foundation of both is of Joliet dolomite. In addition to Matthew T. Scott, the home was the scene of many family events. It was here that the first Adlai E. Stevenson I (1835–1914), who held many important government positions and would become the 23rd Vice President of the United States from 1893 to 1897, courted Scott&#x27;s sister-in-law, Letitia Green; their wedding took place in this house in 1866. 

By 1980 the house was in poor condition and seemed likely to be demolished. It was then bought and restored by Mrs. Elizabeth Stevenson Ives, a great niece of Matthew T. Scott. In 1982 it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==

===Founding===
Colfax was laid out on March 22, 1880, by James E. Wood (1818 – 1908). Anderson was born in Indiana and had come to McLean County about 1855 as State Missionary for the Christian Church. He stayed and became a farmer, a banker, and a lifelong promoter of Colfax. To locals, Anderson was affectionately known as &quot;Uncle Billy&quot;. The northeastern townships of the county were among the last to be served by railroads. After many false starts the Clinton, Bloomington, and Northwestern Railroad began making its way westward from Kankakee. It was aided by contributions in cash and land for the right-of-way by many local farmers. Cropsey, Anchor, and Cooksville were all laid out at the same time as Colfax. The first train arrived in Colfax on July 4, 1880. For two years the track extended only from Kankakee to Colfax, and a turntable was installed to send the trains back eastwards. Eventually the tracks were completed to Bloomington. The railroad soon became part of the Illinois Central system.

Colfax is one of several communities in the United States named for Schuyler Colfax, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives during the terms of Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson and Vice President during the Ulysses S. Grant presidency. Others communities include Colfax, California; Colfax, Indiana; Colfax, Louisiana; Colfax, North Carolina and Colfax, Washington.

===Original design and early growth ===
The original town of Colfax was a rectangle on the north side of the railroad tracks. There were twelve blocks, each with eight or sixteen small lots, and an additional four blocks, each with a single larger lot, were located along the western edge of the original town, for a total of one hundred lots. These faced a widened area of railroad land, which ran the full length of the original town. No other public spaces were designated, but Main Street, which ran parallel to the tracks and one block to the north, was wider than the other streets. The depot was on the north side of the tracks, and the early elevator, lumber yard and stock yard were on the south side. William Rinker erected the first store, which sold groceries. Another grocery store, Wilson and Santee, followed. The third store was a somewhat larger two-story structure built by D.A. Green, who had moved his operation into Colfax from Potosi near the McLean County–Livingston County border. Green sold groceries, dry goods and drugs.

===Coal mining===
In 1886 a company was formed to open the first of two coal mines at Colfax. The first to be opened was the shaft just west of town. Frank Seymour and Sons were paid fourteen dollars a foot to sink the shaft. They encountered problems with water and cave ins and were soon slowed by the need to blast their way through limestone layers before reaching the coal seams. The railroad was unable to bring in sufficient shoring for the shaft, and additional timber had to be hauled in by wagon. At they struck a narrow vein of coal, but excavators had to go down to before finding a productive seam of coal. Miners were brought in, and the first coal was taken in June 1888. Financial troubles and rapid changes of ownership soon followed. The organization of a company to open a second shaft, this one east of town, began in December 1891, but it was June 1894 before digging could begin.

The east shaft encountered great difficulties with water and with layers of quicksand. After many delays and extensive pumping, coal was found in 1895, but trouble with financing delayed production for two years. The 200 miners who flooded into Colfax encountered an acute shortage of housing, which was not solved until a large number of small miners&#x27; cottages could be built: a few of these may still be found in Colfax. Financial troubles quickly mounted. In May 1892 the east shaft had to be sold at auction. In 1901 and 1902 almost 60,000 tons of coal were being taken out of the mines, but increased difficulty with finances soon reduced production. Once the mines were opened, unions were organized and strikes followed. Mining at Colfax proved to be a deadly business; between 1889 and 1902 eleven miners died, most of them crushed by falling rock. The west shaft produced most of the coal, but was closed in 1904. This mine remained idle for many years until being briefly re-opened as a cooperative venture between 1921 and 1924. Eventually the abandoned shaft became a rubbish dump and was eventually filled.

===Growth of the town===
Once established, Colfax grew rapidly. In 1892 a tile factory was built in the northeast corner of town; as was often the case in central Illinois, the former tile factory grounds eventually became a small park. A cigar factory was built. About the same time, a small factory for the manufacture of tin cans started production. By 1888 Colfax had a newspaper, the &quot;Colfax Leader&quot;. Electric lights came in 1895. Four churches began soon after the town was founded: Christian, Methodist, Presbyterian, and Roman Catholic. William H. Anderson, who raised Standard Bred and Road Bred horses, had a half-mile horse track just east of town. After the mines closed, Colfax settled into a quieter life as the commercial hub of a prosperous grain-growing area. However, eastern McLean County has been an area of little population growth, and the population of Colfax, which peaked in 1900, has remained nearly unchanged since 1910.

<text>Cooksville is a village in McLean County, Illinois, United States. The population was 157 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Bloomington–Normal Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Cooksville is in eastern McLean County, east-northeast of Bloomington, the county seat. Illinois Route 165 touches the northwest part of the village leading west-southwest toward Bloomington and east-northeast to Sibley.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Cooksville has a total area of , all land. The village is in the watershed of the Mackinaw River, a west-flowing tributary of the Illinois River.

==History==
===Founding===
Cooksville was laid out under the name &quot;Kochsville&quot; on December 4, 1882, by Frederick Wilhelm Koch (1829 – 1900). Within a year of its founding the name was changed to Cooksville. Koch was a Bloomington real estate dealer. He was born in Westphalia, in what is now Germany, and arrived in the United States on November 6, 1854. Koch was in Bloomington by 1860. He sold thirty or forty lots near his home in west Bloomington, and this neighborhood soon became known as Kochsville, giving Koch the distinction of having two McLean County places named in his honor. Cooksville was founded when the Clinton, Bloomington and Northeastern Railroad was finished from Colfax to Bloomington; in 1880 the part of the railroad from Kankakee to Colfax had been finished, resulting in the 1880 founding of Cropsey, Anchor, and Colfax; but the remainder of the railroad was delayed for two years. The railroad was soon taken over by the Illinois Central and was sometimes known as the Bloomer Line. After requests for the grain elevators to join Alliance Grain, operator of the Bloomer Line, were denied, the tracks from Colfax to Cooksville were removed. This left road transportation as the only available method for grain.

===Design and growth===
Cooksville was incorporated in December 1901. The population of the village peaked in 1910 with 332 people. The design of the original town of Cooksville was a rectangle north of the tracks with the southern blocks slightly truncated because the railroad did not run exactly east and west. The original town contained about 55 lots. The depot was on the north side of the tracks and the two early elevators on the south side. Soon small additions were laid out south of the tracks and on the east side of the original town. In 1883 William G. Darnell established the first grain elevator in Cooksville. Harvey W. Crumbacker also moved to the town in 1883. He established a hardware store and in 1902 built a two-story brick building in the town.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 213 people, 91 households, and 64 families residing in the village. The population density was . There were 94 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the village was 99.53% White, 0.47% from other races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.47% of the population.

There were 91 households, out of which 28.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 59.3% were married couples living together, 12.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.6% were non-families. 25.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 12.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.34 and the average family size was 2.82.

In the village, the population was spread out, with 23.5% under the age of 18, 9.9% from 18 to 24, 29.6% from 25 to 44, 25.8% from 45 to 64, and 11.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 85.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 83.1 males. For 20 years, Cooksville was home to Congressman Kath and his wife, Doris.

The median income for a household in the village was $41,094, and the median income for a family was $48,125. Males had a median income of $31,563 versus $23,594 for females. The per capita income for the village was $16,984. None of the families and 0.8% of the population were living below the poverty line.

<text>Danvers is a village in McLean County, Illinois, United States. The population was 1,089 as of the 2020 census. It is part of the Bloomington–Normal Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Danvers is in western McLean County, northwest of Bloomington, the county seat. Illinois Route 9 passes just south of the village, leading southeast to Twin Grove and then on to Bloomington, and west to Mackinaw.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Danvers has a total area of , all land. It drains northwest toward the West Fork of Sugar Creek, a southwest-flowing stream within the Sangamon River watershed.

==History==

===Origin===
Danvers was laid out under the name of &quot;Concord&quot; on February 20, 1836, by Israel W. Hall (1799 - 1865) and Matthew Robb (1801 – 1870). The name Concord was given to the town by Hall after Concord, Massachusetts. A rival town, Wilkesborough, just over a mile to the east, was laid out by James O. Barnard on June 3 of the same year. Wilkesborough had 96 lots and a public square. Both towns were part of the great town founding surge in Illinois that peaked in 1836. Between 1835 and 1837 eight new towns and many additions were laid out in McLean County. At this time it was fairly common for two towns to be founded close to each other as they competed for the same locational advantage. In this case both towns were on the stage route from Bloomington to Peoria and Pekin. For several years it was unclear which town would be successful. Wilkesborough did quite well and by 1859 had 15 heads of family, but Concord had three times that number. Eventually it became clear that Concord would was the more successful place, but the people of Concord had to go to Wilkesborough to get their mail. By the late 1870s Wilkesborough had completely vanished.

===Original design===
Like many other new places laid out in the 1830s, the original plan of the new town was designed around a central public square. However, unlike most such places (for example, Lexington and LeRoy), the plat used at Concord showed with dashed lines how the streets which entered the public square midway along each side could be extended to meet at the center of the square. In effect, this unusual feature of the plan made it possible to subdivide the square into four smaller rectangles. This was soon done. One of these rectangles has always been a park, but the other three have been put to different civic uses, including locations for the library, fire station, water tower, and school gymnasium.

===Early growth and change of name===
The early growth of Danvers was extremely slow. Although both Hall and Robb lived in the area, neither was a resident of the town. The first building in Concord was erected in 1837 by Nicholas Conger, but Conger himself does not seem to have lived there. The first actual resident was Asa Rankin. Eventually a small mill was erected by Hobson and Havens. In the words of the 1879 county history, &quot;For more than six years the place was nearly lifeless.&quot; In 1848 or 1849 a post office was established in Concord. Most of the early rural settlement around the new town was near Stout&#x27;s Grove, which began just west of Concord, and for the first twenty years of the town&#x27;s life the prairie to the north, east and south was used mainly as open grazing land.

In 1836 Illinois had no way of regulating town names and popular names were frequently repeated. There were at least two other places in Illinois named Concord. Therefore, in 1861, the name of the town was changed to Danvers. The new name was taken from the town of Danvers in Essex County, Massachusetts. During the late 1840s and early 1850s the town grew more rapidly. Danvers was incorporated as a village under a special charter on May 7, 1869.

===Railroads and inter-urbans===
In the late 1850s and 1860s, farmers began moving into the prairies around the newly renamed town, which became the center of an exceptionally productive agricultural district. It became clear that if Danvers was going to ship grain, a railroad was essential. In the 1850s the Illinois Central and the Chicago and Alton railroads had both passed through McLean County, but neither came close to Danvers. A town meeting was held and it was decided that Danvers would subscribe to $50,000 in railroad bonds. Many other communities in the state were taking similar action, something most of them came to regret: the bonds were quickly sold in Europe or the East, and the taxpayers of towns and townships were forced to pay for railroads that often provided indifferent service.

On November 25, 1869, a celebration was held in Danvers to hail the arrival of the first train. A great public picnic was held, and large amounts of chicken, oysters and coffee were consumed. Scheduled rail service would continue until December 1982, and the last special train stopped in Danvers in August 1984. In 1907 Danvers also became a stop on the electric interurban railroad. These tracks were laid along Exchange Street and passed through the center of the town. The Illinois Traction System operated long after similar electric railroads in other areas had closed. In 1942 the interurban tracks were threatened when the government scoured the country for surplus metal for war needs, but citizens protested that the electric railroad was vital to local people and saved great amounts of gasoline. Service on the interurban finally ended on February 21, 1953.

===Later years===
In 1870 the population of Danvers was 356. By 1900 it had climbed to 607 and by 1950 to 762. By 2000 it was over 1,100, meaning that unlike many similar places, the town had grown more rapidly than at any earlier period. Much of this increase in population was due to a substantial number of people who found the town a pleasant residential base when working in Bloomington-Normal or Peoria.

In the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Danvers was the home of Dr. F. J. Parkhurst&#x27;s distinctive alcohol treatment facility, the Willow Bark Institute. Beginning in 1880 the doctor sought to treat addiction to strong spirits by administering small amounts of alcohol, followed by a stiff dose of foul-tasting willow-bark extract. Parkhurst&#x27;s facility operated until about 1920 and was revived by others from 1935 to the early 1950s.

Danvers was also distinctive for its drift gas wells. During the last glacial epoch, vegetation was buried by ice-carried soil. Its decay produced gas that could be tapped in shallow wells and used for some domestic purposes. At one time there were more than seventy such wells in the Danvers area.

The village is currently home to a cooperative grain elevator, two bars, a bank, and a gas station.

==Demographics==

When the Indiana, Bloomington and Western Railway was built in 1869, several buildings were dismantled and reconstructed further south to put the town closer to the railroad. The town was then renamed &quot;Priceville&quot; in honor of John Price, a resident who owned the land near the tracks. In 1902, the town&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Downs&quot;, after postal clerks commonly confused Priceville with the similarly-named Illinois town of Princeville. Downs is named for Lawson Downs, one of the area&#x27;s pioneer settlers.

<text>El Paso is a city in Woodford and McLean counties in the U.S. state of Illinois. The population was 2,756 at the 2020 census. The Woodford County portion of El Paso is part of the Peoria Metropolitan Statistical Area.

El Paso is a small community in central Illinois that took on more characteristics of a highway community after the construction of Interstate 39, which supplanted the older alignment of U.S. Highway 51. The completion of Interstate 39 in Illinois occurred on October 31, 1992, with the final segment between Kappa and Illinois Route 116 near El Paso. The city&#x27;s strategic location at the intersection of the Illinois Central Railroad and the Toledo, Peoria, and Western Railroad played a pivotal role in its development as a vital commercial hub in the 19th century.

In February 2022, El Paso gained national attention when a 100-car pileup occurred on Interstate 39 near the city, shutting down the highway for 12 hours.

El Paso is also home to the El Paso District Library, a Carnegie library built in 1907, and the Legacy Building, originally constructed in 1874 as the Eagle Block Building, which now houses several local businesses and the Project XV Museum.

The city&#x27;s rich history and strategic location continue to contribute to its unique character and community development.

==History==



El Paso was founded by George Gibson and James Wathen. Gibson gave it the Spanish name &quot;El Paso&quot;, either after El Paso, Texas, or because of a nearby railroad junction.

In the 19th century, the city&#x27;s strategic location at the intersection of the Illinois Central Railroad and the Toledo, Peoria, and Western Railroad played a pivotal role in its development as a vital commercial hub. In 1857, the Peoria &amp; Oquawka Railroad was built, linking Gilman on the Chicago branch to El Paso on the main line, thereby establishing a connection between these two significant divisions, and, on December 3, 1871, the Oilman, Clinton &amp; Springfield Railroad, which connected the branch to the state capital, officially began operations. The Illinois Central Railroad, in particular, attracted numerous businesses and settlers, spurring economic growth and connecting the town to larger cities. This connection laid the foundation for El Paso&#x27;s continued expansion into the late 1800s, fueling its business and social activity.

In 1867, El Paso tried unsuccessfully to become the county seat of Woodford County by offering $30,000 to Metamora to relinquish the title. A closely contested vote initially favored El Paso, but a recount reversed the decision by a margin of ten votes. Several towns, including Eureka, El Paso, and Roanoke, vied for the county seat over the years. Not until 1894 did Eureka successfully become the county seat. During this period, El Paso&#x27;s growing commercial center was supported by businesses along its newly paved Front Street, which became a key part of its identity.

The first post office in El Paso Township was established by Caleb Horn at his house, about two to three miles from Kappa, with mail carried by horseback twice a week. The first store in the township opened in Kappa around the time the Illinois Central Railroad passed through the area, and the first mill in El Paso was built by Ives. The Horn post office, called Roxan, moved to Kappa in 1853, and William M. Jenkins became the first postmaster of El Paso in 1857. Over time, the post office moved locations several times, including a move to a building on Elm Street in 1861 and later to the Shur, Tompkins &amp; Co. Bank building. Over the years, the post office moved several times, with key changes including the relocation to Elm Street in 1861, the transfer to the Shur, Tompkins &amp; Co. Bank building in the 1860s, and finally, the move to its current location in 1901. By the mid-1900s, multiple rural mail routes had been established, and in 1964, a new post office building was opened, marking a significant development in the town&#x27;s postal services.

The Campbell House in El Paso, Illinois, was built in 1854 by William Campbell, an early settler and prominent local figure, and it served as an important stagecoach stop along the Peoria and Bloomington Road. The building was razed in 1938. The house, later preserved as a historic landmark, reflects the pioneer spirit of the region and the city&#x27;s early development. A memorial on the property honors the Campbell family&#x27;s contributions to El Paso&#x27;s history, celebrating their role in shaping the community.

In 1869, El Paso was depicted in a map entitled &quot;Map of El Paso, Woodford County, Illinois&quot; by Albert Ruger, which provided a detailed panoramic view of the town, showcasing its early infrastructure, including streets, buildings, and notable landmarks such as religious institutions. This map offers a snapshot of El Paso as a growing community with a bustling railroad intersection at its core. By the late 19th century, Front Street had become the central hub of El Paso&#x27;s business district, reflecting the town&#x27;s growth alongside the railroad. A major reconstruction effort in 1894 transformed the street with the addition of brick-paved roads and new commercial buildings, solidifying its status as a bustling center of commerce. In addition to commercial activities, the Eagle Block Building, constructed in 1874, became a key social center, housing various businesses, a library, and even the city&#x27;s opera house. Today, Front Street continues to preserve its historic charm while serving as a vital part of the community, with revitalization of the sidewalks occurring in 2022.

Education played a crucial role in El Paso&#x27;s development. By 1878, Panola Township had ten school districts—Panola, Hilsabeck, Shaw, Pauley, De Vries, McOmber, Hodgson, Bassett, Roth, and Punke—with a total of 480 students, demonstrating the community&#x27;s early commitment to education. In late 1856, Handley King built a home at First and Pine streets, where his aunt taught the first school with 20 pupils, and later, Jennie Fishburn and Harry H. Hewitt became key figures in the community&#x27;s growing educational efforts, which led to the addition of classrooms due to overcrowding. El Paso&#x27;s school district initially encompassed the entire village and most of the northern half of El Paso Township, but a rivalry between east and west side businessmen led to the division of the district in 1869, with two separate schools established. The East Side school, built in 1869, and the West Side school, initially a wooden structure replaced by a brick building in 1897, operated independently until 1944, when a popular vote consolidated the districts into one unified grade school district. Despite this rivalry, educational advancements were made, including the introduction of a four-year high school program in 1892 and the creation of El Paso Township High School District #375 in 1916, culminating in the construction of a new high school building in 1921. In addition to these educational institutions, El Paso&#x27;s commitment to learning is also reflected in the establishment of the Carnegie library in 1907, a cornerstone for public education and community enrichment. The library continues to serve as a resource for residents of all ages, offering a place to read, learn, and grow.

These historical landmarks and developments highlight El Paso&#x27;s evolution from a railroad junction to a thriving community rich in culture, education, and commerce. The preservation of buildings such as the Campbell House and the Eagle Block Building, along with the continued importance of Front Street and the El Paso Public Library, ensures that the legacy of this pioneering town will be remembered for generations to come.

== Education ==



El Paso&#x27;s school district, CUSD #11, is the product of a consolidation with the school district of Gridley, IL. CUSD #11&#x27;s schools are split between El Paso and Gridley:
* El Paso Gridley High School - Housing all of the high school students for the district
* El Paso Gridley Junior High School - Housing all of the upper and lower levels of junior high (grades 5, 6, 7, and 8) students for the district
* Centennial School - Housing all the grade 3 and 4 elementary students of the district
* Jefferson Park - Housing all the preschool, kindergarten, and grade 1 and 2 elementary students of the district

The educational landscape of El Paso, Illinois, has evolved significantly since the mid-19th century. In 1850, Reverend Abner Peeler taught the first school in Kansas Township near Zachariah Brown&#x27;s cabin. By 1857, the town of El Paso had constructed its first schoolhouse, where Henry Hewitt served as the inaugural teacher.

By 1859, the Illinois Central Railroad tracks divided the city into East and West sides, prompting the establishment of two rival school districts. The East Side school, constructed in 1869 and completed in 1870, was later named McKinley School after President William McKinley&#x27;s assassination in 1901.

Both schools initially offered two-year high school programs, with the East Side school graduating its first student, Julia Toussieng, in 1874. By 1893, both schools had expanded their curricula to include four-year high school courses. In 1910, the high school programs were consolidated at Jefferson Park, though the grade schools remained separate until 1944.

El Paso Township High School District #375 was established in 1916 following voter approval, despite legal challenges that reached the Illinois Supreme Court. A new brick high school was constructed in 1921, featuring modern amenities such as an auditorium and gymnasium.

In 1948, El Paso Community Unit District #375 was formed, unifying the high school and grade school districts. The district expanded to include outlying areas such as Secor and the Mackinaw River region near Carlock. Rural schools, including many one-room schoolhouses, were consolidated, and students were transported by bus to centralized schools in El Paso.

By March 2004, voters approved the merger of El Paso Unit #375 with Gridley Unit #10, creating El Paso-Gridley Community Unit School District 11. This new district began operation on July 1, 2004, with the high school located in El Paso and the junior high in Gridley. Today, the district serves students across Woodford, McLean, and Livingston counties, continuing a legacy of educational progress.

Prairie Christian School located in El Paso was established in 1991 to provide a Christ-centered learning environment with high academic standards for students from kindergarten through eighth grade.

==== El Paso District Library ====

The El Paso District Library in El Paso, Illinois, has a rich history dating back to 1873 when the Ladies&#x27; Library Association established a volunteer library in various locations throughout the town. In 1906, their efforts culminated in securing a grant from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, leading to the construction of a beautiful two-story library building.

The library has served the community for over a century, situated at the heart of town in Jefferson Park, conveniently located near the elementary, middle, and high schools. It has been a cornerstone for education and lifelong learning, offering books, services, and knowledge to all, and instilling a love of reading in citizens of all ages.

In 2010, the library began exploring the possibility of expanding its facilities to accommodate increased usage, a growing collection, and to provide greater accessibility. Fundraising efforts took place through 2012 and 2013, leading to the commencement of construction in 2013. The expanded library opened its doors on May 3, 2014, celebrated by hundreds of community members. This expansion was completed solely with grants and donations from the community.

The addition brought several improvements, including full accessibility, increased space for books and accessories, improved areas for public computers and technology, separate meeting spaces for library and community programs, quiet study rooms, and dedicated areas for the storage and display of El Paso&#x27;s history. Notable rooms include the Edward and Marjory Heiken Children&#x27;s Room, the Lester Pfister History and Genealogy Room, and the Drake Family-Heartland Bank Community Room.

Today, the El Paso District Library remains a centerpiece and gathering place for the community, continuing its mission to promote education and lifelong learning.

==== The Legacy Building and Project XV Museum ====

The Legacy Building, located at 1 West Front Street in El Paso, Illinois, was originally constructed in 1874 as the Eagle Block Building. This historic structure has served various purposes over the years, including housing the American Dairy Association, the First National Bank, and the city&#x27;s opera house. In 1894, a devastating fire destroyed much of Front Street, including the original building. However, the vault of the First National Bank survived the blaze, allowing for the reconstruction of the building, which was completed in 1895.

Today, the Legacy Building houses several local businesses, such as Can Do Kids International, Heirloom Photography, The Legacy Opera House, and Virginia Lee&#x27;s home decorating business. The building also features a restored opera house that accommodates up to 200 guests, making it a popular venue for weddings and special events.

Adjacent to the Legacy Building is the Project XV Museum, dedicated to honoring the history of voting rights in the United States. The museum is named after the 15th Amendment, which granted African American men the right to vote. A significant exhibit focuses on David A. Strother, a local barber who, in 1870, became the first African American to vote in Illinois after the passage of the 15th Amendment. The museum aims to educate and empower communities by shedding light on the rich history of voting rights.

The Legacy Building and the Project XV Museum together serve as important cultural and historical landmarks in El Paso, Illinois, preserving the town&#x27;s rich heritage and promoting education on voting rights.

==== Illinois Central Railroad and Toledo, Peoria, and Western Railroad Freight House ====

The Illinois Central Railroad and Toledo, Peoria, and Western Railroad Freight House, located at 8-10 East Front Street in El Paso and known as &quot;The Depot&quot; by locals, was a key transportation hub in the region, serving both railroads. El Paso was founded in the 1850s by landowners who successfully competed to secure the site of the crossing of these two major rail lines, marking a turning point in the city&#x27;s development. The depot, initially constructed in 1889-90 following the destruction of the original building, played a vital role in shipping agricultural products from the surrounding area and in supporting the local economy by facilitating the movement of goods. The depot remained operational for many years, becoming a cornerstone of the city&#x27;s economic activity until rail transport began to decline in the 1930s, ceasing entirely by the 1960s. Despite the decline, it stood as the longest-surviving structure associated with both railroads until its eventual demolition and relocation.

The freight depot&#x27;s historical significance was formally recognized when it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 16, 1994. Though it was relocated to 17 East Main Street in El Paso, it retains its status on the register, preserving the memory of its contributions to the city&#x27;s development. The depot, once a bustling point of activity, symbolizes the important role that railroads played in the economic life of the American Midwest during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Even after rail traffic ceased, the building remained a part of the fabric of El Paso, long after the area had seen a decline in rail use.

In 2000, the building found a new purpose when it became the Archbishop Fulton John Sheen Spiritual Centre. Archbishop Sheen, born in El Paso in 1895, was a prominent Catholic figure, known for his popular television programs and his impactful work as a bishop. The center showcases exhibits dedicated to his life and legacy, including personal items such as his 1953 Emmy Award, along with magazines, photographs, and videos of his work. The center is dedicated to preserving his memory and providing an educational experience about Sheen&#x27;s contributions to the Church and media. The refurbished depot has become a focal point of inspiration and reflection, drawing visitors from across the country.

== Parks ==







El Paso maintains multiple public parks that provide recreational opportunities and green spaces for residents and visitors alike. These parks serve as hubs for community activities, outdoor leisure, and cultural events, reflecting the city&#x27;s dedication to enhancing quality of life. With features ranging from historic bandstands to modern playgrounds, the parks offer a blend of history, charm, and contemporary amenities.

=== Jefferson Park ===

Established on May 26, 1857, Jefferson Park, one of El Paso&#x27;s original parks, was donated by Wathen during the city&#x27;s platting. Enclosed with an iron fence in 1877 to protect it from wandering cattle, the park also featured a bandstand that became a focal point for community events and summer concerts. The Kiwanis Bi-centennial Memorial was built in 1976 by the Kiwanis Club of El Paso as part of the celebration of the United States&#x27; bicentennial to honor this milestone and commemorate the community&#x27;s involvement in the celebration. The Kiwanis also added a picnic shelter to the west of the memorial in 1997 followed by a second shelter to the south of the first. The park currently offers a children&#x27;s playground, picnic tables, shelter, and an outdoor stage. The block on which the park resides is also home to the El Paso District Library, which occupies the southern triangle of the block. Jefferson Park is known colloquially as Library Park by locals.

=== Franklin Park ===

Also established on May 26, 1857, Franklin Park, donated by the Gibson family, is another of the city&#x27;s original parks. Similar to Jefferson Park, Franklin Park was enclosed by an iron fence in 1877 and later improved with diagonal walking paths in 1912. During the 1914 community improvement effort, 536 wagonloads of dirt were added to raise the park&#x27;s grade. Over time, additional features such as drinking fountains, playground equipment, and flower beds were incorporated. An iconic slide in the shape of an elephant was added to the playground area in 1962 through fundraising efforts by the El Paso Women&#x27;s Club.
 Plans for a gazebo to serve as a central gathering spot for events and visitors in the center of Franklin Park commenced in 2021 with completion of the gazebo in October 2022. Nicknamed &quot;Elephant Park&quot; due to its iconic elephant slide, Franklin Park remains a cherished recreational area in El Paso.

=== Corn Belt Park ===

Established in 1951 on a former Fursman &amp; Straight tile factory clay pit purchased by the city on October 4, 1920, Corn Belt Park has been a central recreational area in El Paso. The city used the pit located at Main Street and Pine Street for refuse until full, leveling the area in 1951 for conversion into a park named El Paso Corn Belt Park. The park currently offers basketball courts, a small playground area, and a sheltered picnic area.

=== South Pointe Park ===

South Pointe Park, located on the southern edge of El Paso, offers modern recreational facilities including walking trails, sports fields, recreation center, pool, and playground. Development of the park began in 1987 with the city&#x27;s purchase of the land south of Clay Street. An Olympic-sized swimming pool with a lap pool and diving board opened for use in 1992. The Community Building directly to the east of the pool also opened in 1992 and provides space for public meetings, private events, and local programs. With construction beginning on the facility in 2022, the American Buildings Recreation Center features a gymnasium, fitness rooms, and spaces for indoor sports and exercise classes, significantly expanding the park&#x27;s year-round recreational offerings. Today, South Pointe Park remains an essential part of the El Paso community, supporting sports leagues, family gatherings, and various public events.

=== Bike Trail &amp; Walking Path ===
The Bike Trail &amp; Walking Path is a 5.4-mile multi-use path that extends from approximately 1.5 miles north of El Paso to South Pointe Park, effectively bisecting the community. Developed along a former railroad right-of-way as part of the Rails to Trails program beginning in 1989, the trail offers a flat, accessible route for both cyclists and pedestrians. The trail begins at South Pointe Park on the city&#x27;s south side and traverses through El Paso, concluding near a creek north of town amidst cultivated fields. The 1.3-mile northern extension was added via a grand in 1992. This conversion of the abandoned railway into a recreational asset reflects the city&#x27;s commitment to repurposing historical infrastructure for community benefit. The trail provides residents and visitors with a scenic route for exercise and leisure, enhancing the city&#x27;s recreational offerings.

<text>Ellsworth is a village in Dawson Township, McLean County, Illinois, United States. The population was 184 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Bloomington–Normal Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Ellsworth is in eastern McLean County, east of Bloomington, the county seat, and north-northeast of Le Roy.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Ellsworth has a total area of , all land.

==History==
===Founding and original design===
Ellsworth was laid out on December 6, 1871, by Jonathan H. Cheney (1833–1920), Almon Brigham Ives (1816–1887), and Oliver Ellsworth, whom the town was named after. Cheney was one of three sons of early McLean County settler Jonathan Cheney active in promoting the Lafayette Bloomington and Mississippi Railroad; when his brother, Haines Cheney, was in the Illinois Senate he had helped to arrange the charter of the railroad. Almon B. Ives was a Bloomington lawyer specializing in land law; both Cheney and Ives were on the board of directors of the new railroad. In 1876 the railroad was leased to the Lake Erie and Western Railroad and in 1879 was incorporated into that road. Construction began on the railroad in 1869. The new townsite occupied on each side of the tracks. The plan of Ellsworth was almost identical to that of its neighbor, Arrowsmith. A swath of railroad land cut the town into two almost equal parts. Most of the early commercial development was along Main Street south of the tracks. The depot was on the south side of the tracks, and the early elevator on the north side.

===Selling of Ellsworth at auction===
In November 1871 an advertisement appeared in the Bloomington &quot;Pantagraph&quot; saying that on November 8 an auction of 150 lots would be held at the site of the new town. The advertisement praised the fertility of the surrounding countryside and stressed that the farms were of moderate size. Readers were told that the new town would be the logical point for shipping grain. They were also told that by shipping from Ellsworth their grain would go through Toledo, Ohio, &quot;avoiding the grain scalpers of Chicago.&quot; All interested people were to gather at the Illinois Central Depot in Bloomington at 9:00 in the morning. A free train would take them to the site of the new town. A free lunch would be provided, and Bloomington brewers Meyer and Wochner would provide the beer. Some two hundred people consumed 200 loaves of bread, 150 pounds of boiled ham, 60 barrels of cheese and a barrel of crackers. A. J. Wampler bought the first lot. Most lots sold at from forty to sixty-five dollars.

===Development of Ellsworth===
Many local merchants were attracted to the new town. John Campbell moved his store from Stumptown about south of Ellsworth. Stumptown was soon totally abandoned. Edwards and Wampler moved their stock from a store in rural Blue Mound Township and were soon reported to be doing a thriving trade; Wampler became the first postmaster. Henry Vandervoort and Joseph Pierce opened a hardware store in 1873. August Flint had a wagon shop. The town founders donated &quot;a good lot&quot; for a church. In 1872 regular freight service began along the new railroad. Many new houses were built. Grain was soon being purchased and shipped. After a brief boom the population soon exceeded 200, but growth soon slowed.

About 5.9% of families and 6.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 9.6% of those under age 18 and 4.6% of those age 65 or over.

==History==
===Founding===
Gridley was laid out on November 25, 1856, by Thomas Carlyle (c. 1832 - ?) and George Washington Kent (1820–1901). After considering the names &quot;Kent&quot;, &quot;Carlyle&quot;, and &quot;Gardner&quot;, for the governor of Massachusetts, it was decided to name the town for Bloomington banker, lawyer, and land developer Asahel Gridley (1810–1881). Both Carlyle and Thomas were working for Gridley at the time the town was founded, and two years after the town was laid out Gridley purchased all of it. Along with many other towns in central Illinois, the town was established when the Peoria and Oquawka Railroad crossed the state from west to east. The railroad soon became the Toledo Peoria and Western.

===Original design and the &quot;Depot Grounds&quot;===
At first glance the original town of Gridley looks like many towns laid out along new railroads built in central Illinois in the 1850s. In addition to the strip granted to the railroad, there were long narrow rectangles on both the north and south sides of the tracks. In most cases these areas, usually labeled &quot;Depot Grounds&quot;, have evolved into parks or been put to other public uses. At Gridley, half of the northern Depot Ground was dedicated as a long narrow &quot;Public Square&quot;. The remaining &quot;Depot Grounds&quot; would soon cause problems for the town. The remainder of the town was a fairly conventional grid of north-south and east-west streets. There were 33 blocks, most containing ten or sixteen lots. The town grew quite rapidly. Gridley then surprised everyone by announcing that he was re-platting the entire town and subdividing the land near the railroad. He argued that although the plat did say &quot;depot grounds&quot; he had never actually dedicated the land to the railroad or to public use. By that time the railroad and private individuals had built on the railroad grounds and the people of Gridley had used them as a location for the town jail. Gridley asked the courts to eject other people from his land. The case known as &quot;Gridley v. Hopkins&quot; eventually worked its way up to the Illinois Supreme Court, which sustained Gridley but ultimately left the others with their buildings. It became an important legal precedent and left a long legacy of local bitterness toward Gridley.

===Early development===
The early growth of Gridley was rapid. On February 28, 1857, the first train arrived in Gridley. A small depot building was erected on the north side of the tracks. J.M. Mitchell built the first store on the corner just north of the depot. A small house and blacksmith shop was built south of the railroad. Charles Cochrane George Washington Kent, the town&#x27;s co-founder, moved to Gridley. There was a brief setback in 1858 when a tornado swept through the town, damaging Cochrane&#x27;s and Kent&#x27;s house and twisting the newly laid rails, but growth quickly resumed. Kent built the first grain elevator. He then enlisted in the Union Army, serving first as sergeant and then lieutenant. Upon his return he guided the town through additional growth; among other things he dug up trees along the Mackinaw River and hauled them to town where they were planted in public square. In 1884 Fred Donner established a tile factory. It was first incorporated as a town under a special charter. By 1900 the town had a population of 735.

===Fire of 1901===
On Saturday, May 4, 1901, a fire destroyed most of downtown Gridley. The afternoon of May 3 had been hot and windy. At 3:40 in the afternoon smoke was seen rising from the alley behind Cohn&#x27;s store. There had been a serious fire in July 1891, and the town seemed well prepared, with several cisterns and a dedicated force of volunteer fire fighters. Soon stores along both sides of Center Street were engulfed in flame. Water was pumped from several cisterns and then hoses were run to the flooded pit of the tile factory. All of the able bodied people in town, and many from the surrounding countryside, joined in the fire fighting effort. The state bank and many other structures burned to the ground. A message was telegraphed to Peoria for help, but before it could arrive the blaze had subsided. Damage was estimated at $100,000, a severe blow for a small town. Rebuilding quickly began.

===Later history===
Until the third decade of the twentieth century, Gridley had been a railroad town; in the early 1920s six passenger trains in both directions served the town. Then, in June 1924, the newly paved Route 8, today US-24, was opened. The hard road quickly destroyed rail passenger traffic. In 1925 it was announced that the depot would be closed on Sundays. In 1929 all passenger traffic ended. One of the more tragic episodes in Gridley&#x27;s history took place on September 3, 1946. Striking railway workers had attempted to shut down the Toledo Peoria and Western Railroad. In response the railroad loaded a train with fourteen workers and four armed guards who were tasked with keeping the tracks open. Striking workers followed the train in automobiles, driving along U.S. Route 24, which paralleled the tracks. Whenever the train slowed it was pelted with rocks. At Gridley the train stopped and a gun battle erupted. When it was over, two workers were dead and three were wounded. A jury later found that the guards were acting in self-defense, and were therefore innocent. However, for the most part Gridley was peaceful, with a flourishing civic life. The Fourth of July was celebrated with races. There were Saturday night band concerts in the park, which by the 1940s had given way to free movies. Many recreational improvements were made. For example, in 1937 the old clay pits from the tile factory were bought by the town for use as a skating rink, and in 2001 the Gridley Telephone Museum opened.

<text>Heyworth is a village in McLean County, Illinois, United States. It was founded in 1859. As of the 2020 census, Heyworth had a population of 2,791. It is part of the Bloomington–Normal Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Heyworth was laid out by Campbell Wakefield on September 11, 1859. Before settlement, the locality now known as Heyworth was covered by a heavy growth of timber and underbrush which was inhabited by the Kickapoo Native Americans, and supported a great number of deer, wild turkeys, and packs of large gray wolves.

As settlers began to move West, families such as the Rutledges, Funks, Passwaters, Bishops, Nobles, Wakefields, and Martens settled in the immediate vicinity of the present village of Heyworth as early as 1824. Campbell Wakefield was the primary founder of Heyworth. In the course of his achievements, Wakefield became the owner of a vast tract of land including what is now Heyworth. He continually added to his original tract until he obtained about in one plot.

As the population of the region increased and industries began to spring up, railroads were becoming a great advantage. In 1852 and 1853, the Illinois Central Railroad was constructed through the Wakefield land. When the line became operational in 1855, the residents hoped to put a train station in the vicinity. Many property owners vied for the station, but Wakefield immediately donated a large tract of land for the station. Additionally he set aside adjacent land for the foundation of a town, a Presbyterian church, and a district school.

The first post office was built in the municipality in 1856, when the new station was opened. The station was named &quot;Elmwood&quot;, but it was soon discovered that this name was already taken by a locality in Peoria County. The president of the Illinois Central Railroad proposed calling the new station &quot;Heyworth&quot;, after Lawrence Heyworth, an English director of the railroad.

After the establishment of the station, Campbell Wakefield made several donations to encourage trade and induce businessmen to locate in the new town. He became the proprietor of the new town, and the village of Heyworth was incorporated on March 31, 1869.

==Geography==
Heyworth is in southern McLean County and is served by two U.S. highways. U.S. Route 51 passes through the west side of Heyworth as a four-lane divided highway, leading north to Bloomington, the county seat, and south the same distance to Clinton. U.S. Route 136 passes through the village center, leading east to Rantoul and west to McLean.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Heyworth has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.86%, are water. Kickapoo Creek passes through the western part of the village, flowing southwest to Salt Creek and then the Sangamon River, a tributary of the Illinois River.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2007, there were 2,547 people,(+3.1% from 2000), 898 households, and 687 families residing in the village. The population density was .

<doc id="111686" wikidata="Q2672022" url="?curid=111686" title="Hudson, Illinois">
<text>Hudson is a village in McLean County, Illinois, United States. The population was 1,753 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Bloomington–Normal Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Hudson is located in northwestern McLean County at . Interstate 39 passes along the western boundary of the village, with access from Exit 5. I-39 leads south to Normal and north to El Paso.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Hudson has a total area of , all land.

==History==
===Origin and naming===
Hudson was laid out by Horatio Petit on August 13, 1836. It was one of eight towns founded in McLean County during the great real estate boom that swept through central Illinois between 1835 and 1837. It also shares the distinction of being one of two &quot;colonial&quot; settlements in the county; the other was the Rhode Island colony in the southwestern part of the county. Traditional sources say that the town was named for the town of Hudson in Columbia County, New York, which, so it was said, was the home of its early settlers. However, in her book on the Hudson Colony, Ruth Biting Hamm has pointed out that, while some settlers were from Queens County, New York, none came from near the town of Hudson. She suggests that it is more likely town was simply named for the Hudson River.

===The Illinois Land Association===
Hudson was created by the Illinois Land Association, who developed it as what was then called a colony. Colonial schemes such as this were popular in the 1830s. Rather than settlers migrating individually and buying land on their own, participants in a colony would band together, pool their money, and appoint a committee to select a large tract of land, which would then be divided among the participants. Such colonial developments do not imply that the group had any common social or religious agenda. Sometimes, the people involved came from a single area, but often, as was the case in Hudson, they were clusters of individuals who had no connection forming the colony: several of the founders of Hudson were from New York, but others were from Maine, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Illinois. 

The Illinois Land Association was formed in February 1836 in Jacksonville. Each participant would contribute $235 to the common pool and would receive four kinds of property: three lots in the main part of the town; one out lot (see below); of prairie land for farming; and of timber for fences, firewood, and building material. The association also anticipated a profit from the sale of untaken land, which would be shared among the participants. An executive committee selected the land, supervised the laying out of the town, and presided over the drawing of lots to select the division of the property.

===Original town design===
The 1836 plan of the town of Hudson was interesting in several respects. First, most central Illinois towns of the 1830s were laid around a central public square, but Hudson had none. Second, the town of Hudson had both &quot;in lots&quot; - and &quot;out lots&quot;. The &quot;in lots&quot; formed the core of Hudson and were standard blocks of lots like any other town. These were surrounded by a ring of &quot;out lots&quot;, which were slightly larger, but still part of the original town plan. At Hudson the &quot;out lots&quot; differ in size. The tradition of in and out lots goes back for centuries in New England, where farmers were reluctant to consign their livestock to locations far removed from the town center. 

These &quot;out lots&quot; should not be confused with the far larger tracts of farming land that were also assigned to each settler. It is unclear why this out-of-date design should have been adopted at Hudson. The original town contained 30 blocks of &quot;in lots&quot;, each of which contained eight lots; because each participant received several lots, the houses in the older part of town even today are often much more widely spaced than in other towns founded at the same date. Broadway was designed as the main street of Hudson, and because of this was wide, while other streets were only wide. Eventually the &quot;in lots&quot; and the &quot;out lots&quot; came to be used in much the same way, as residential building sites.

===Development===
Immediately after its founding Hudson fell on hard times. In 1837 the land market turned sour, settlement slowed, and Illinois sank into a deep depression. The organizers of the colony found that they were unable to purchase the intended of timber for each settler; earlier settlers had already purchased most of the available woodland. A few families received up to , but most were only given only ; too little to supply their needs. Disputes arose concerning the division of profits from land sales. The number of settlers was fewer than expected. Only about twenty families moved onto the colony&#x27;s land. 

They did manage to build a number of substantial frame houses. There was a nearby school and two churches, but the townsfolk had little business. All of this changed in 1854 when the Illinois Central Railroad passed just west of Hudson. Business increased, many unoccupied lots were taken up, and a new commercial district developed along what had been &quot;out-lots&quot; along the west side of the town facing the railroad. Some old traditions continued. Early in its history, Hudson, following an ancient New England custom, had created the office of village herdsman. It was his job, at 6:00 in the morning, to walk the town streets, gather cattle from Hudson, and drive them out to pasture beyond the town limits; remarkably this job continued until 1913.

===Growth continues===
With the arrival of the railroad, the success of the town of Hudson was assured. The surrounding tallgrass prairie proved to be some of the most fertile agricultural land in the world. Initially the crops were corn and oats, produced together with a great deal of livestock. In the 1850s and 1860s settlers came in great numbers. By the mid-twentieth century livestock production had slowly begun to decline and soybeans had replaced oats as a second crop, but the great fertility of the soil remained. Hudson&#x27;s growth was slow but steady. In 1873 the town was incorporated. By 1883 telephone service had come to the town, and in 1912 the first electric lights were installed. In 1916 a new town hall was built. In the late twentieth century, because of its proximity to Bloomington and Normal, Hudson was becoming increasingly popular as a residential community. In 1992 Interstate 39 was completed, connecting Hudson with El Paso and Normal.

<text>Le Roy (also styled &quot;LeRoy&quot;) is a city in McLean County, Illinois, United States. The population was 3,512 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Le Roy is located at (40.347168, -88.762293).

According to the 2010 census, Le Roy has a total area of , of which (or 99.32%) is land and (or 0.68%) is water.

==History==

===Founding of LeRoy===
LeRoy was laid out on 28 November 1835 by Asahel Gridley (26 April 1810 – 25 January 1881) and Merritt L. Covell (30 January 1808 – 17 September 1847). The founders were Bloomington businessmen. They had served together in the Black Hawk War, Covell as a captain and Gridley as a lieutenant. Because of their brief service both men were popularly called &quot;General&quot;. Both would later serve in the Illinois General Assembly, and Gridley would eventually become McLean County&#x27;s first millionaire.

LeRoy was the first of eight towns to be laid out within the present boundaries of McLean County during the great Illinois town-founding boom which peaked in the summer of 1836. LeRoy was located on a low mound, on prairie land, where the Bloomington to Danville state road crossed the road from Shelbyville to Chicago. The chief problem confronting Gridley and Covell was a place called Munroe, which consisted of a single store run by John W. Baddeley (24 June 1794 – 19 February 1871). It was located a mile and a half southwest of the new town. Although generally said to have been laid out in 1834 or 1836, no plat of the town has yet been found. Baddeley had been born in Whitchurch, Shropshire, England, and had come to the United States with his family in 1832. He had quickly entered a thousand acres (4 km) of land in Empire Township and seemed on his way to becoming a wealthy and important man. Baddeley was offered twenty-seven prime lots in LeRoy if he would move his store to the newly established town. Baddeley agreed. He lost most of his fortune in 1837 but continued to do business in LeRoy for many years.

===Original design of the town===
Like most Central Illinois towns of the 1830s LeRoy was built around a central &quot;Public Circle&quot;. The circle at LeRoy featured streets which joined the public area midway along each side and is very similar to squares platted at Mt. Hope, Danvers, and Lexington. Except for some rounding at the corners to ease the flow of traffic, the square today retains its 1835 shape. Gridley and Covell&#x27;s &quot;Original Town&quot; contained twenty-five blocks, almost all with eight lots, for a total of 196 lots. Early commercial growth was along Center Street just east of the square, and this has continued to be the commercial heart of the town. The original street names selected for LeRoy are virtually identical to those in the town of Lexington, which Gridley also co-founded: Center, Cedar, Cherry, Chestnut, East, Elm, Main North, Oak, Pine, Vine, Walnut and West. Unlike Lexington, LeRoy has no South Street.

===First advertisement===
In November 1835 Gridley and Covell set about selling lots in their new town. They published a lengthy advertisement in the &quot;Sangamon Journal&quot; which is both the earliest description of LeRoy and a statement of why the two men had selected this location for a town. It begins with the bold heading &quot;Town of Leroy&quot;. The reader is first told that Leroy was located on the north side of Buckle&#x27;s Grove on Salt Creek. The crossing of the two roads is noted along with being east of Bloomington. &quot;The site of the town is as beautiful as can well be conceived – situated on the margin of a rolling undulating prairie on an eminence gently descending in every direction and commanding an extensive view of the surrounding country, with an open expanse of prairie scenery on the north and west relieved by occasional groves of timber. No situation can well surpass it for beauty.&quot; They go on to write that LeRoy is &quot;... located in the heart of a rich and flourishing settlement with a large amount of timber of quality inferior to none in the state in its immediate vicinity... it is believed that no interior town possesses superior advantages.&quot; Several excellent mill sites were located nearby. The advertisement concludes, &quot;A further description is deemed unnecessary, as all who wish to make investments will doubtless visit it previous to investing.&quot; Unlike many ads of the period, the date and time of the auction of town lots is not given. Later sources relate that the lots sold well, &quot;the bidding was spirited, and some of them sold at a high price.&quot;

===Early development of the town===
The early growth of LeRoy was slow, but the town did better than many other towns laid out in the 1830s. Only three of the eight McLean County towns laid out during the 1830s boom still survive—Danvers, LeRoy, and Lexington. During the fall of 1836, several log cabins were built in the town and Edgar Conkling erected a frame store. Gridley persuaded Hiram Buck to move to LeRoy and establish a hotel; in 1838 Buck became Post Master. In 1836 Conkling and a partner laid out a vast new addition to the town that tripled its size. The first mill, built by Elisha Gibbs on the south side of the town, burned in 1844. Buckles and Farmer responded by building a second mill that also burned. The first large brick commercial building was built for T. J. Barnett in 1858 at a cost of $3,000. By 1850, LeRoy had established itself as the second largest town in the county. It was incorporated as a town in 1853 and as a city 10 August 1874.

===Railroad era===
After the Civil War, the citizens of LeRoy were convinced that only a railroad could assure the prosperity of their town, and they took the lead in campaigning for what would eventually become the Indiana, Bloomington and Western Railway. In 1866 a meeting was held in LeRoy to generate support for the railroad. The following year, by a vote of 202 to 6, they voted to tax themselves to help pay for the railroad. Eventually they would subscribe $75,000 in bonds to the railroad. The railroad would pass through the southwest corner of the original town, with the depot located five blocks west of the square in Block 44 of Conkling&#x27;s Addition. On 1 May 1870 the first train steamed into town. Disappointment quickly followed. The bonds were promptly hypothecated, that is, used as security to borrow money. In practice this meant that the citizens of LeRoy still had to pay each year, but had no say in the running of the railroad. The new railroad found itself in deep legal and financial trouble. Service was poor and rates exorbitant. Rather than simply complain, the people of LeRoy decided to build their own railroad. The narrow-gauge railway was begun in 1876. It ran down the center of Oak Street eastward to Rantoul, in Champaign County, where it joined the Illinois Central. The idea was to bring down freight rates by providing competition for the I.B. &amp; W. Much of the labor was done by local people. Local people called it the &quot;Pumpkin Vine&quot;, a popular folk name for any small railroad, also applied to several railroads in Indiana. The railroad was eventually sold to the Illinois Central and widened to standard gauge. It never carried a great deal of traffic, but was the object of a great deal of local pride.

===In the twentieth century===
By 1900, LeRoy had two newspapers, four churches, one hotel, two grain elevators, three doctors, three lawyers, and twenty-five stores. Its population was 1,629. Slowly LeRoy ceased to be a railroad town. Passenger service on the &quot;pumpkin vine&quot; ended in 1931. Passenger service on the railroad between Bloomington and Urbana ended in 1957. The depot in LeRoy was torn down in 1967, and the last train ran in 1980. Soon after that the tracks were torn up. In the early 1970s, Interstate 74 was completed and new businesses began to develop near the highway exit. Population growth between 1900 and 1950 growth was slow, just under twelve percent. However, by the end of the century the population of LeRoy had more than doubled as the town increasingly became a residential center for both Bloomington–Normal and Champaign–Urbana.

<text>Lexington is a city in McLean County, Illinois, United States. The population was 2,090 at the 2020 census. There are two theories regarding the etymology of the city name. One says it was named for the Battle of Lexington, where General Gridley&#x27;s father fought. and the other that it was named for the home town of James Brown, the town&#x27;s co-founder.

==History==

===Origin and original town design===
Lexington was laid out on 4 January 1836 by Asahel Gridley (1810–1881) and James Brown (c. 1802- ?). Gridley was a lawyer and banker from Bloomington who would eventually become the richest man in McLean County; Brown was born in Lexington, Kentucky, and Lexington, Illinois, seems to have been his only attempt at founding a town. Its founding was part of a great real estate boom that swept across the nation. Within a few months of the founding of the town seven other new towns were laid out in McLean County: Concord (now Danvers), Hudson, Le Roy, Livingston, Lytleville, Mt. Hope and Wilksborough. In common with other towns founded during the 1836 boom, and unlike many later towns, Lexington was designed around a central public square with streets running true north–south and east–west. In the case of Lexington, the original town consisted of 36 blocks, each containing six lots. Like most of the towns of the 1836 era the town was built along the line that divided woodland from prairie; the southeast corner of the town was just within the limits of timber. Like most Mackinaw River towns, Lexington was laid out on higher ground some distance from the river itself.

===First advertisement and sale of town lots===
Gridley and Brown first offered lots in the town for sale at a public auction on 30 April 1836 at 10:00 in the morning. They began their printed advertisement for the sale by telling readers that the town was on the main road from Springfield, via Bloomington, to Chicago and that their new town was a mile from the Mackinaw River. They wrote that Lexington &quot;is located on the margin of a fine rolling prairie, near a large and inexhaustible body of the best timber the country affords, sufficient to justify the immense settlement already being made.&quot; They told potential buyers that there were two saw mills and a fulling mill nearby. Moreover, they added, building had already begun. For those with good security, one twelve months credit was available.

===The pre-railroad era===
Between 1837 and 1854 the survival of Lexington was in doubt. The great land rush that peaked in 1836 gave way to a severe lengthy national depression. True to their word, Gridley and Brown had begun some construction. Their first structure was used as a store, but in less than a year the business had failed and the building was hauled away to Bloomington. The first house was briefly occupied, but it was soon moved to the rival town of Clarksville, which was located a few miles downstream. No one was certain exactly what route the Springfield-to-Chicago road would take. Clarksville tried to attract the road by building a bridge across the Mackinaw River and the 1840 town of Pleasant Hill, which had been established just upstream from Lexington, was doing its best to attract traffic. The county began to demand taxes on the large number of unsold lots in the town; by the early 1850s over 300 Lexington lots were offered for sale to satisfy unpaid taxes. The town square was used for grazing cattle. Yet some continued to believe in the new town. Jacob Spawr (1802–1902) had moved into Lexington a year after the store had departed. He built a house of a type known as a double log pen, a dog trot, or sometimes two-pens-and-a-passage: essentially it was nothing more than two log cabins facing each other with a common roof. This building served as dwelling, post office and tavern. Because Lexington was halfway between the county seats of Pontiac and Bloomington, Spawr&#x27;s house provided a convenient stopping place: Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas were frequent guests. In the 1850 United States census Spawr&#x27;s occupation is listed as &quot;landlord&quot;. By 1854 it was estimated that there were only about a dozen families in Lexington.

===The railroad comes to Lexington===
On 4 July 1854 the railroad, which would soon be known as the Chicago and Alton, reached Lexington. Suddenly everything changed. A grain warehouse which had been built by Thomas Kincaid was hauled across the tracks, given a passenger platform, and put to use as a railroad station. Dawson and McCurdy built a grain elevator. Three denominations erected churches. The town formed its own government; their first act was to buy up the stock of the two local whiskey sellers and pour the contents of the bottles into the mud of Main Street. The Mahan brothers built a downtown windmill. A new hotel was built. Lexington boomed. By 1865 the first brick block had been erected. On 21 November 1860, the train brought Abraham Lincoln to Lexington, where he spoke a few words of goodbye to his old friends; on 2 May 1865, just before noon, another train passed through Lexington, this one holding Lincoln&#x27;s body.

===&quot;People v. Chicago and Alton Railroad Company&quot;===
The town of Lexington soon became the focus of a case that would change American legal history. Soon after railroads began servicing the Midwest, it became evident that, if a railroad could unilaterally set its own freight rates, it could soon drain most of the wealth from nearby farmers. The result, in Illinois, was a new state constitution that in 1870 gave the government a role in setting railroad and warehouse rates; the wording and legal arguments behind this part of the new constitution was the work of Bloomington lawyer Ruben M. Benjamin (1833–1917). A test case was needed, and Benjamin settled on Lexington. The Chicago and Alton Railroad only charged four dollars and thirty five cents to ship of lumber from Chicago to Bloomington, but asked for five dollars to ship the same amount of lumber the shorter distance from Chicago to Lexington. In 1871 Benjamin brought suit against the railroad. The railroad responded that it was forced to charge less to ship lumber to Bloomington because there was more competition there than at Lexington. The case worked its way up to the United States Supreme Court where &quot;People v. The Chicago and Alton Railroad Company&quot; became part of the celebrated Granger Cases, named for the Granges of the Patrons of Husbandry, a group that had argued for rate regulation. These cases, at least for a time, established the right of governments to regulate corporations.

===President Roosevelt comes to Lexington===
Of all the events in the history of Lexington, perhaps the best remembered was the day President Theodore Roosevelt came to town. By the afternoon of 15 July 1902, a crowd of twenty thousand people had gathered near the Chicago and Alton tracks. A long grandstand had been erected and covered in red, white and blue. The Chief Executive and hero of San Juan Hill shook hands with the reception committee, but declined to leave the train. Roosevelt gave a brief but rousing talk from the observation platform at the back of the train. The crowd roared its approval. It was the only time a sitting president had visited the town.

===Lexington and Route 66===
Transportation was always the key to the success of Lexington. The city got its start as a rest stop on the Chicago Trail, which was part of the larger Pontiac Trail between Chicago and St. Louis. The very first mention of Lexington&#x27;s name in the press in 1836 included mention of the town&#x27;s location on the stagecoach road between Springfield and Chicago. Lexington&#x27;s success as a town was later assured when it became a railroad station between Springfield and Chicago. During the twentieth century, rail traffic slowly declined and was replaced by road traffic. By World War II, only two trains a day stopped at Lexington, and all passenger traffic by rail ended in 1946.

In 1915, a paved road along the former stagecoach route, which almost exactly paralleled the Chicago and Alton Railroad rail line, reached Lexington. This paved road was known as State Bond Route 4 or SBI 4, and it followed the Pontiac Trail between Chicago and St. Louis. In November 1926, there was a general renumbering of state highways following the creation of the U.S. Route System, and Route 4 became Route 66. For the next 50 years, Lexington was a popular stopping point on this famous American road. In 1955, U.S. Route 66 was locally widened to four lanes, as a partially divided highway with a grass median between the northbound and southbound lanes along much of its stretch. U.S. Route 66 served the community until 1978, when Interstate 55, which also closely paralleled the old highway, was opened to traffic and Route 66 was thereafter decertified. However, near Lexington, much of the old highway may still be driven, as the 1955 roadbed of the southbound lanes was retained as a two-lane county road (the disused northbound lanes remain nearby).

<text>McLean is a village in McLean County, Illinois, United States. The population was 743 at the 2020 census, down from 830 in 2010. It is part of the Bloomington–Normal Metropolitan Statistical Area. McLean is the home of the Dixie Travel Plaza.

==Geography==
McLean is in southwestern McLean County. Interstate 55 passes through the east side of the village, with access from Exit 145 (U.S. Route 136). I-55 leads northeast to Bloomington, the county seat, and southwest to Lincoln. US 136 (Dixie Road) runs along the south edge of the village center and leads east to Heyworth and west to San Jose.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, McLean has a total area of , all land.

==History==
===Founding===
The village of McLean was laid out on June 22, 1855, by Franklin Price (1821 - 1908). Price was born in Chester Valley, Pennsylvania, and was the brother-in-law of Bloomington real estate developer Kersey Fell. Price came to Bloomington in 1849; he worked as a clerk and newspaper writer and was elected mayor of Bloomington in 1855 and again in 1856, serving until 1858. Price never lived in the new town he founded.

McLean was laid out when the Alton and Springfield Railroad, soon to become the Alton Railroad, was first built through McLean County. The nearby towns of Atlanta, Normal, and Towanda were laid out at the same time as McLean. There had been an earlier attempt to found a town nearby.

Mt. Hope, two miles east of McLean, was established in 1836 by the Providence Farmers and Mechanics Emigrating Society of Rhode Island. The colony and its town were not a success; only three settlers actually arrived in McLean County. When the town of McLean was founded, the church building from Mt. Hope was moved into McLean. The first residents of McLean were the brothers G.L. and F.A. Wheelock, railroad employees, who moved into the new station house to conduct business. A blacksmith shop was the first business, and H.H. Dillon built the first warehouse.

McLean was incorporated as a village on May 29, 1866. By 1900, it had grown to a population of 532.

===Original town design===
The design of the original town of McLean remains almost unaltered to this day from the original plans. The design was similar to other places along the Alton and Springfield Railroad, including Normal, Towanda, Odell, and Dwight. The original town was basically a square with streets aligned north–south and east–west, split diagonally by the railroad with a line of lots paralleling either side of the tracks.

As in other towns along the same railroad, there was a widened rectangular area paralleling the tracks labeled &quot;Depot Grounds.&quot; In the case of McLean, the depot grounds were laid out only on the southeast side of the railroad. The triangle of land on the northwest side, between the lots paralleling the railroad and remainder of the town, was designated as a public property and is still used as a park. The comparable triangle on the opposite side of the tracks was unlabeled, and its intended use is unclear. This same arrangement of public land was followed at the village of Towanda.

McLean was distinctive in that there were no streets between the diagonal line of lots along the tracks. Perhaps because of this, much of the business district developed along Morgan Street, which ran east–west just north of the park, or along Hamilton Street, which ran north–south, just west of the park. The line of lots paralleling the tracks and southeast of the railroad became the location of the hotel and the town jail. Later additions on the east side of the town featured additional lots which parallel the railroad, as well as more conventional blocks.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 808 people, 314 households, and 248 families residing in the village. The population density was . There were 330 housing units at an average density of .

<text>Normal is a town in McLean County, Illinois, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town&#x27;s population was 52,736. Normal is the smaller of two principal cities of the Bloomington–Normal metropolitan area, and is Illinois&#x27; seventh most populous community outside the Chicago metropolitan area. The main campus of Illinois&#x27; oldest public university, Illinois State University, a fully accredited four-year institution, is in Normal, as is Heartland Community College, a fully accredited two-year institution. Chris Koos has been the mayor of Normal since 2003.

==History==

The town was laid out with the name North Bloomington on June 7, 1854, by Joseph Parkinson. From its founding, it was generally recognized that Jesse W. Fell was the force behind the creation of the town. He had arranged for the new railroad, which would soon become the Chicago and Alton Railroad, to pass west of Bloomington and then curve to cross the Illinois Central Railroad at a point where he owned or controlled land. Most of the original town lies south of these tracks, with Beaufort Street as its northern limit, and some blocks west of the Illinois Central and north of the tracks. Fell, his brothers, and associates quickly laid out many additions to the original town.

The town was renamed Normal in February 1865 and officially incorporated on February 25, 1867. The name was taken from Illinois State Normal University, a normal school (teacher-training institution) located there. The school has since been renamed Illinois State University after becoming a general four-year university. Normal is adjacent to Bloomington, Illinois, and when mentioned together they are known as the &quot;Twin Cities&quot;, &quot;Bloomington–Normal&quot;, &quot;BN&quot;, or &quot;BloNo&quot;.

In 2007, the town council voted to name the downtown area &quot;Uptown Normal&quot;, and, as of 2011, Uptown Normal is home to the Children&#x27;s Discovery Museum, Marriott Hotel and Conference Center, Hyatt Place Hotel, Uptown Station and Town Hall, Brewe-Ha&#x27;s Bar and Grill, and a variety of local shops and restaurants all centered around a roundabout. The district is also home to the historic non-profit Normal Theater, a restored Art Deco theater owned by the Town of Normal that shows classic and independent films.

On August 31, 2021, a mass shooting occurred at a mobile home park in Normal that left three people dead and three more injured. The deceased were two women and a man, the latter being the gunman. He was killed by numerous Normal Police Officers after they discharged their firearms at him .

<text>Saybrook is a village in McLean County, Illinois, United States. The population was 654 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Bloomington–Normal Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Known by locals as the &quot;City of Shade and Water&quot;, it is believed to be named in honor of Old Saybrook, Connecticut.

==Geography==
Saybrook is in southeastern McLean County, east of Bloomington, the county seat; northeast of Farmer City; and southwest of Gibson City.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Saybrook has a total area of , of which , or 3.49%, are water. The Sangamon River, at this point the size of a small creek, flows southeasterly through the southwest part of the village. Saybrook is the uppermost community on the Sangamon.

==History==
===Founding===
Saybrook was laid out March 4, 1856, by Isaac M. Polk (c.1814–?). Little is known about Polk as he was born in Indiana and did not live in McLean County for very long. In 1860 and 1870, he was in neighboring Livingston County.

Before Polk, Jonathan Cheney came to the area in 1825 and built a cabin across the river from what is present-day Saybrook. Then, in 1833, Robert Cunningham built a water-driven mill on the Sangamon, which was later replaced by a steam-driven mill. By 1857, the town consisted of a saw mill, a blacksmith shop, a carpenter shop, one store, and eight dwellings. The woodland along the Sangamon, which became known as Cheney&#x27;s Grove, attracted early settlers. The township in which the town was situated took its name from the woodland and was called Cheney&#x27;s Grove. The name &quot;Saybrook&quot; was adopted in 1865, likely by settlers who came from Old Saybrook, Connecticut.

The town of Saybrook was incorporated May 29, 1866.

===Original town plan and development===
The original town of Saybrook was one of the smallest in McLean County. It consisted of a simple square of four blocks, each containing eight lots. This original plat was laid out over a series of road and lot lines that were aligned at roughly 45 degrees to the first official town plat. Several old lines, shown in dashed markings, can be seen on the 1856 plat. The original town had no square or other distinguishing features. Lore says its indistinction was to make the town look as large as possible to railroad promoters, but this seems unlikely as Saybrook (and thus its physical properties) was well known to many of the men associated with the founding of the railroad. In 1866, the town council laid out a large addition north and east of town.

===Bending the railroad===
One thing evident to the citizens of the fledgling town: it would only flourish if a railroad could be attracted. The most likely railroad was the one which would later become the Lake Erie and Western. It would be built to run due east from Bloomington to Paxton in neighboring Ford County and, because of this, would probably miss Saybrook by several miles. At this point, three Cheney brothers, sons of Jonathan Cheney, entered the picture. Haines Cheney, then in the Illinois Senate, had arranged for the charter of the road. To fund the railroad, local towns and townships would issue bonds, which the taxpayers would eventually retire. Two other Cheney brothers, Jonathan H. Cheney and William H. Cheney - who was the second largest landowner in Cheney&#x27;s Grove Township - became members of the railroad&#x27;s board of directors. William H. Riggs, the supervisor of Cheney&#x27;s Grove Township, was also on the board. Cheney&#x27;s Grove Township voted to fund $50,000 in bonds, and the town of Saybrook added an additional $10,000 in bonds. With this kind of backing, the route of the road was deflected and it passed through the town. In November 1871, when the tracks reached the village limits of Saybrook, a great celebration was held. A bottle of champagne was produced, but rather than smash the bottle, the thrifty reception committee simply knocked off its neck so the contents could be consumed later. The new Christian church in Saybrook invited visitors from Bloomington to attend their first service and announced that there would be a special train &quot;on our railroad&quot;.

===After the railroad===
Once the railroad was established in 1870, Saybrook grew rapidly and soon became the largest grain shipping point in eastern McLean County. A depot with depot grounds was established just south of the original town. The railroad goes over the Sangamon River. In 1870, Thomas Holloway built the large brick Union House Hotel. In 1872, a newspaper was established. There was a boom in the construction of houses and stores. By 1900 there were 879 people in the town. In the twentieth century, the population of Saybrook declined by about fifteen percent. By 2000 Saybrook was smaller than it had been a century before.

<text>Stanford is a village in McLean County, Illinois, United States. The population was 600 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Bloomington–Normal Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
===The beginnings of Stanford===
Stanford was platted, under the name of &quot;Allin&quot;, on December 14, 1867. Its founder was John Armstrong (1820–1912). It was founded when the Jacksonville Division of the Chicago Alton and St. Louis Railroad was extended westward from Bloomington. The McLean County town of Covell was founded, within a few months of Allin, as a station on the same railroad. In 1870 the name of Allin was changed to &quot;Stanford&quot;. It was incorporated as a village in June 1874. The town&#x27;s founder, John Armstrong, was born in Posey County, Indiana. He was first a farmer and then ran a grocery in Stanford, where he continued to live until his death in 1912. For many years after the town was founded, John Armstrong ran a grocery in Stanford.

===Original town design and development===
The original town of what would soon become Stanford had an unusual L-shaped design, with the leg of the &quot;L&quot; extending to the east along the railroad tracks. The large area in the crook of the &quot;L&quot; was not platted, but remained in the hands of John Armstrong, the town founder, whose residence was near the tracks on the north side of the railroad. Rather than a central square, the original plat of Stanford, like many towns laid out in the 1850s and 1860s, featured two rectangular public areas labeled as &quot;Depot Grounds&quot; which extended along either side of the tracks. The depot itself was on the north side of the tracks and, in 1874, the grain elevator on the south side. As the town developed, most businesses were located south of the tracks. By 1895 these included a hotel, a bank, the Masonic Hall, and several stores. Except for the depot, most of the railroad-related facilities were on the depot ground south of the railroad. These included a stock yard, a lumber yard, and several elevators. This area also held a bandstand. There were two early churches in Stanford: the Christian Church on Boundary Street south of the business district and the Presbyterian Church in the southeastern part of town.

==Geography==
Stanford is in western McLean County, west-southwest of Bloomington, the county seat. Illinois Route 122 passes just north of the village, leading northeast to Bloomington and west to Minier.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Stanford has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 670 people, 236 households, and 190 families residing in the village. The population density was . There were 253 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the village was 97.91% White, 0.90% Native American, 0.15% Asian, and 1.04% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.90% of the population.

There were 236 households, out of which 43.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 62.3% were married couples living together, 14.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 19.1% were non-families. 16.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.84 and the average family size was 3.14.

In the village, the population was spread out, with 29.9% under the age of 18, 10.4% from 18 to 24, 30.3% from 25 to 44, 20.3% from 45 to 64, and 9.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 88.8 males.

The median income for a household in the village was $49,375, and the median income for a family was $52,639. Males had a median income of $35,500 versus $27,813 for females. The per capita income for the village was $18,687. About 2.3% of families and 3.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 3.1% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.

<doc id="111693" wikidata="Q1988166" url="?curid=111693" title="Towanda, Illinois">
<text>Towanda is a village in McLean County, Illinois, United States. The population was 431 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Bloomington–Normal Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
===Origin===
The village was named for Towanda in Bradford County, Pennsylvania. The name means &quot;burial ground&quot; in Nanticoke, an Algonquian language. The land on which Towanda stands was first entered by Charles Badeau who had graduated from Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut, in 1840, and was employed as the assistant to the chief engineer of what was then the Alton and Springfield Railroad. Because in Illinois at that time it was illegal for railroads or their officials to establish new towns, much of the land was then transferred to two McLean County real estate developers, Jesse W. Fell (1808 – 1887) and Charles W. Holder (1819 - 1900). These two men laid out the town of Towanda and filed the plat on December 7, 1854. Fell, a native of Chester County in southeastern Pennsylvania, was a widely known land dealer in central Illinois who played a major role in founding many towns in the region, including Clinton, Dwight, Normal, and Pontiac, and who was the driving force behind the establishment of the school that would become Illinois State University. Holder was linked with Fell in many of his town founding schemes including Normal, Illinois, and Larchwood in Lyon County, Iowa; the McLean County town of Holder is named in his honor. Fell&#x27;s association with the railroad goes back to the time when it was surveyed. On at least two occasions he was able to alter the path of the railroad to suit his own interests: organizing a bend in the road so it would pass through his town of Normal and making a slight change in the survey so it would pass through the Livingston County town of Pontiac, where he had interests, rather than the rival town of Richmond. Shortly after Towanda was laid out, most of the land was back in the hands of the railroad&#x27;s land agent, English-born Charles Roadnight (1814-?). Roadnight built the first warehouse in Towanda; he settled in Bloomington, had a farm in Dwight, and in 1858 later became treasurer of what was then the Chicago and Alton Railroad.

===Original design===
Central Illinois towns of the 1830s, such as Bloomington, Lexington, Leroy and Pontiac, were usually built around a central square. In contrast, most towns of the 1850s, like Towanda, were oriented toward the railroad tracks. In the case of Towanda a diagonal main street was established parallel to the railroad, with the main building lots on only one side; the effect was to have the commercial establishments look across the street toward the tracks. This was a common design in newly established towns along the Chicago and Alton Railroad and may be found, with slight variations, in places like Dwight, Gardner, Odell and McLean; Fell&#x27;s town of Normal, established at the same time as Towanda, was to have had exactly the same arrangement; except that in Normal, the original street paralleling the railroad quickly lost its importance to the reverse side of the block. This standard town plan often left town designers with odd triangular pieces of land, where the diagonal street met with other streets which were aligned north–south or east–west. These triangles are often still in public hands. In the case of Towanda, Fell gave each of two triangular areas, one on either side of the tracks, to the town. On the original deed they were given the name &quot;plaza&quot;, and both have always served the city as parks.

===Development===
Alex Warren built the first residence in the new town and James Alexander the first warehouse. These were soon followed by Wesley Bishop&#x27;s grocery and Frank Henderson&#x27;s dry goods store. The largest building was a two-story structure built by Charles Roadnight, which was ; the first floor was used for stores and the second as a meeting room. It burned about 1900. In 1873–1874, wooden sidewalks were being built, followed by brick sidewalks in 1891 and concrete walkways in 1916. The town was officially incorporated in 1870. The first jail was built in the North Park and replaced at least once; the structure can not have been very substantial because in 1901 the town fathers were forced to appoint a committee to inquire into what had happened to the jail. Perhaps the most exciting event in the town&#x27;s history was the attack on the Buena Vista Tavern. A group of local women took exception to the amount of money their menfolk were spending on whiskey. They assembled at the hardware store where they were issued hatchets. They then marched into the Buena Vista smashing bottles, threatening the barman, and hurling whatever they could find through the tavern windows. Each of the women was fined one dollar.

===Early views===
A series of photographs taken in the 1870s give a striking view of early Towanda town. They show a town crisscrossed with fences and looking rather like the set for a western movie. Cattle and hogs were driven into town at night and penned before shipping on the railroad. Houses are carefully fenced to protect gardens from stray livestock. The majority of the homes are wooden I-cottages: single story, or story-and-a-half, wood frame dwellings with a symmetrical façade. There are some modest two-story structures. Along the railroad, long rail corn crib may be seen. The simple board-and-batten railroad station is clearly visible. Perhaps the most striking structure is a stone tank house topped with a windmill.

===Twentieth century===
Towanda has been plagued with fires. In 1905, a large part of the downtown area burned, and in 1917 the original railroad station went up in flames. However, there was also progress. In 1901, telephone service began, and in 1937 Main Street was paved. Still, Towanda remained in the shadow of its larger neighbors to the south, Normal and Bloomington, and was always smaller than Lexington, the next town north on the stagecoach road and the Chicago and Alton Railroad line, which generally paralleled each other between Chicago and Springfield.

Trains were essential to the development of the town, but traffic was never heavy; in 1887, only one southbound and one northbound freight stopped at Towanda. Passenger service stopped altogether in the 1940s. Most travel had long since been replaced by automobile and truck traffic along the roads that paralleled the Chicago and Alton rail line: State Bond Route 4 during the 1910s, U.S. Route 66 from 1926 through the early 1970s, and Interstate 55 from the 1970s onward. In 1955, U.S. Route 66 was locally widened to four lanes, as a partially divided highway with a grass median between the northbound and southbound lanes along much of its stretch. The former southbound lanes of Route 66 are now long disused, whereas the northbound roadbed is still in use as a two-lane local highway and the current path of Historic U.S. Route 66 in Illinois, now known as the Illinois Route 66 Scenic Byway, a designated National Scenic Byway.

When in 1977 the construction of Interstate 55 detoured U.S. Route 66 in a gradual curve around the northwest side of Towanda, a -mile section of southbound Route 66 was closed off to motorized traffic and abandoned. Between 1998 and 2000, a not-for-profit student and community project created the Towanda Historic Route 66 Parkway, also known as the Historic Route 66 Trail (as seen on Google Maps), on a stretch of the old disused Route 66 roadway between the south end of Towanda and a point about northeast, where Interstate 55 swings east to meet up with and once again closely parallel Historic Route 66. The parkway, an ongoing project that preserved the Money Creek Bridge north of town on Route 66 and begins about northeast of the bridge, also includes an outdoor educational exhibit on the history of Route 66 called &quot;Historic Route 66: A Geographic Journey&quot; that details the path of Route 66 through all eight states. This exhibit extends from the intersection of Historic Route 66 and Jefferson Street near the I-55 interchange to a point at the southern tip of town just past an unnamed pond off Historic Route 66 (at 40.557656, -88.908876), where there is a rest stop and parking area for catfish and bass fishing in the pond. The stretch of the parkway where the exhibit was erected is a subset of the overall Towanda Trail, which includes a three-flagpole garden on the northeast corner of Jefferson Street and Route 66, several picnic areas along the length of the trail, scattered birdhouses, and intermittent landscaped areas extending from the Money Creek Bridge to the south end of the pond.

<doc id="111697" wikidata="Q575425" url="?curid=111697" title="Petersburg, Illinois">
<text>Petersburg is a city in and the county seat of Menard County, Illinois, United States, on the bluffs and part of the floodplain overlooking the Sangamon River. It is part of the Springfield, Illinois Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 2,258 at the 2020 census, nearly unchanged from 2010. Petersburg is located approximately north of New Salem, the original location where Abraham Lincoln first settled, as he started his career.

==History==
The town began as a planned community organized by real estate speculators Peter Lukins (for whom the town is named) and George Warburton. Abraham Lincoln worked as the surveyor who first mapped, measured and help to divide lots on the land. Petersburg quickly grew, due to an advantageous placement on the river, becoming the county seat in the 1830s and eventually drawing off the population of New Salem, which was abandoned in 1840.

Many of the lush Victorian-era homes built by early wealthy inhabitants still stand on the bluffs of Petersburg. The town itself takes great pride in these structures, which has even preserved some of the original cobblestone streets to complement the classical architecture.

==Economy==

Petersburg began as a trade center for agriculture in the region and a shipping point, where a railhead met a point in the Sangamon River that was both navigable and crossable. In recent decades, the depth of the Sangamon River at Petersburg has become too shallow for navigation, due to silting from local farming and from the diverting of natural runoff into artificial reservoirs such as Lake Petersburg and Lake Springfield.

The economy of the area is still derived primarily from agriculture, particularly in corn production. Tourism is a steady (if small) industry, and the town caters to Lincoln enthusiasts as a gateway to New Salem and in housing some relics of Lincoln&#x27;s early life in Illinois. There are also a growing number of bed and breakfast inns, many of which are located in restored Victorian homes. Recent developments have also turned the town into a bedroom community for the state capital of Springfield, Illinois, which is to the southeast.

==Geography==
Petersburg is located in central Menard County and Illinois Route 97 passes through the city on Sixth Street, leading northwest to Havana and southeast to Springfield, the state capital. Illinois Route 123 enters Petersburg from the south with IL 97 but leaves to the east on East Sangamon Street. IL 123 leads east and south to Athens, and southwest to Illinois Route 125 near Pleasant Plains.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Petersburg has a total area of , all land.

The bulk of Petersburg lies on the bluffs overlooking the Sangamon River, though a portion of it, including the downtown/courthouse square area, is technically on the floodplain of the river. The Sangamon flows north, then west to the Illinois River at Beardstown.

The town itself is moderately forested, a stark contrast to the flat plains around it. The trees are mostly deciduous maples and oaks, and New Salem State Park is home to a sizable stand of old-growth forest.

==Natural disasters==

Petersburg was damaged by an earthquake originating in the New Madrid Fault on July 18, 1909. The earthquake was felt over most of central Illinois, but Petersburg suffered the most widespread damage.

The portions of Petersburg located below the bluffs suffered major flood damage during the intense flood season of 1993. The city and Menard County have since undertaken a campaign to buy and eliminate the low-income housing located in the most flood-prone areas, creating a small series of parks near the Sangamon River.

Shortly after 12:30pm on December 31, 2010, an estimated 40 homes were damaged by a tornado, with 22 of the homes listed as uninhabitable by local officials. The tornado was caused by springlike weather during which the temperature was in the 60s across central Illinois.

A site on the bluffs just north of Fults, overlooking the Bottoms, is known as Saltpeter Cave and took its name from the quantities of bat guano mined there for potassium nitrate, which was used in the local manufacture of black powder by the French at Fort de Chartres and later inhabitants. This cave, cut into the side of the bluffs and an excellent defensive position, was one of the last refuges for Native Americans in the region.

Maeystown may be said to have begun its growth as a town in the year 1852, when Jacob Maeys built a sawmill on what had become known as McRoberts Meadow, which he purchased in 1848. For a year after its construction the mill remained idle, on account of there not being sufficient water to drive it. Steam engines were then put in place, and the mill successfully operated. The first store was opened in 1858 by Jacob Maeys in partnership with Judge Abraham Poston. By this time some half a dozen houses had been erected in the place. A town had been surveyed and laid off in 1856 by Maeys, and called &quot;Maeysville&quot;. A post office was established in 1860, which changed the name to Maeystown, with Jacob Maeys appointed as first postmaster.

The entire village, save for a small strip of land on the northeast side, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Maeystown Historic District.

==Geography==
Waterloo is located northeast of the center of Monroe County at (38.335243, -90.152685). Illinois Route 3 passes through the west side of the city, bypassing the downtown; it leads north to Columbia and southeast to Red Bud. Downtown St. Louis is to the north.

The city sits on a ridge that drains east to tributaries of Prairie du Long Creek and west to tributaries of Fountain Creek. Prairie du Long Creek is a southeast-flowing tributary of the Kaskaskia River, while Fountain Creek is a west-flowing direct tributary of the Mississippi River. Waterloo is along the historic trail that went from Kaskaskia to St. Louis.

==History==

===Prehistoric period===
=== French and British periods ===

Waterloo&#x27;s history dates back to the 18th century, with the French being the first Europeans to settle in the area. The site was ideal because of its elevation; the proximity of the Mississippi River Valley brought frequent flooding to the lowlands. It was also close to Fort de Chartres, a French stronghold. They named their settlement &quot;Bellefontaine&quot; (originally La Belle Fontaine), meaning &quot;beautiful spring&quot;. This name related to a spring of water a mile south of the site of Waterloo, a frequent campsite on journeys between Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and St. Louis. France had long since abandoned the area, as it had been ceded to Britain in the wake of the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1763 and had since been unoccupied. But while the outpost was included in the territory surrendered by France, Louis XV famously mourned the loss of Waterloo.

===Post–Revolutionary War===
The first documented English speakers came in the spring of 1782, when James Moore (lumberjack), Larken Rutherford, and James Garretson, of Maryland and Virginia, settled at or near Bellefontaine. Upon their arrival, they were the first permanent English speakers in the entire Northwest Territory. James Moore and many of the settlers that followed him had been soldiers in George Rogers Clark&#x27;s Illinois campaign of 1778. Moore established himself at the site of the namesake spring, and the tract remained in possession of the Moore family for over a century. The kitchen of the Bellefontaine House, situated a short distance west of the southern end of Main Street, is believed to be Moore&#x27;s original log cabin. It was restored and remains as a local landmark.

The Rutherford family settled in the vicinity, while the Garretsons selected a location a mile northeast of the spring. Judge Shadrach Bond, uncle and namesake of Illinois&#x27; first governor, was also a part of the Moore party of settlers. It had been assumed that when these immigrants left the country east of the Allegheny Mountains that the settlers would not come into conflict with the natives. However, it was not long before the new settlers began to feel threatened, and James Moore was elected captain of the company raised for the protection of the colony. At this point in time Illinois was considered a county of Virginia, and so the commission received by Captain Moore came from the governor of Virginia, Patrick Henry. He was directed to establish a military post and command the Illinois militia. Moore&#x27;s company was one of four raised from Illinois, which along with six others raised elsewhere would later become the 17th U.S. Infantry.

A fort (or blockhouse) was accordingly built at Bellefontaine, and during the Northwest Indian War it was one of the most frequented places of sanctuary. Captain Moore made considerable effort to establish amicable relations with the Native Americans, and it was finally with the help of Gabriel Cerré, a wealthy merchant of St. Louis, that he achieved peace by establishing a trade agreement between the warring factions. One of Moore&#x27;s sons, James B. Moore, would later be a delegate to the convention that framed the first Illinois Constitution and was eventually elected to the State Legislature. Other settlers came to the area, and by 1800 Bellefontaine&#x27;s population had reached 286, making it the third largest town in Illinois and representing over a tenth of the then-total population of the territory.

===Peterstown===
In 1816, a man named Emery Peters Rogers arrived in the area from Massachusetts and, four years later, opened the first permanent store, mill, and quarry. Peters, as he preferred to be called, built a stone structure in 1830 at the north end of Main Street to serve as his store as well as a stagecoach stop. Now known as the Peterstown House, it is still standing, and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 16, 1977. Due to his influence, the neighborhood around Peters&#x27; store came to be referred to as &quot;Peterstown&quot;. As the years passed, the town was divided into two parts: Bellefontaine at the south and Peterstown at the north. The two communities were divided by a creek, and there was said to have been intense rivalry between them. Legend has it that in 1818, a man named Charles Carroll, an Irishman, came upon the scene, and to the astonishment of the Peterstown men and the Bellefontainers, ignored the rivalry and built his house on one side of the creek, his barn on the other and said &quot;It won&#x27;t be Bellefontaine, and it won&#x27;t be Peterstown, but begorra, I&#x27;ll give ye&#x27;s both your Waterloo.&quot;

Emery Peters Rogers&#x27; brother, Dr. John Rogers, arrived in 1826 and would come to be known as the region&#x27;s leading physician. David H. Ditch&#x27;s log home-turned-hotel was converted into a courthouse in 1825, when Waterloo was declared the county seat. In 1836 the town contained no more than twenty buildings, including a small, two-story brick courthouse, a Methodist church, a log building used as a schoolhouse, a wind-powered mill, and a blacksmith&#x27;s shop.

The town was inhabited by several notable residents throughout the 1800s. George Forquer of Pennsylvania purchased a considerable portion of land in 1818, working closely with Daniel P. Cook to plan out the rapidly developing town. Forquer would later serve as an Illinois state senator, the fifth Secretary of State of Illinois (1825–1828), the fifth Illinois Attorney General (1829–1832) and, most famously, an early political enemy of Abraham Lincoln. Cook was a prominent lawyer, and later a member of Congress, giving his name to Cook County. Forquer&#x27;s younger half brother, Thomas Ford, would become the state&#x27;s governor.

===19th-century German settlement===
The town experienced a marked population increase after 1840, and that is when the German population got its impetus, the original German settlers having arrived in the 1830s or even earlier. Some came from populations in the former colonies, but many came directly from Germany, either overland from the East Coast ports, or upriver from New Orleans. These came in search of their own land, and to escape the widespread political unrest in Germany at the time. Many of the city&#x27;s buildings, its citizens, and especially its local character still reflect the heritage left by those German settlers. Many calques and idioms such as those found in Pennsylvania Dutch English persist, and there are a number of German words which commonly sprinkle casual conversation.

===Bellefontaine renamed Waterloo===
Waterloo received its charter as a town February 12, 1849, and the charter was amended in 1855 and 1859. It was chartered as a city on August 29, 1888.

===20th century===
On December 1, 1978, the Waterloo Historic District was recognized and placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The city of Waterloo also has been recognized for its work through Sister Cities International. On October 2, 1980, Waterloo announced a Sister Cities partnership (officially recognized April 1981) with Porta Westfalica in (then) West Germany. Due primarily to the efforts of Vera Kohlmeier of Waterloo and Helmut Macke of Porta Westfalica, it came about as a result of genealogical research, which concluded that perhaps two-thirds of Monroe County&#x27;s German population could trace their ancestry back to this region of northern Germany.Porta Westfalica itself came about in 1973 as a conglomeration of 15 villages into a city of over 40,000. Located on the Weser River in northern Germany, Porta Westfalica is situated in a valley between two large hills. Trips by large groups typically occur every two years, including visits by the Waterloo German Band and the Bläserkreis, Porta&#x27;s 70-member youth brass band. Charitable donations have also been raised for East German refugees and the victims of the 1993 flood. This partnership, which goes by the portmanteau Portaloo, has since assisted other communities in the area to establish Sister Cities programs of their own, including Columbia/Gedern, Belleville/Paderborn, and Millstadt/Groß-Bieberau. &quot;Portaloo&quot; has been honored with seven coveted Reader&#x27;s Digest awards for its Sister Cities program. Every summer this city holds it annual &quot;Porta Westfalica Fest&quot; or &quot;PortaFest&quot; in honor of its sister city.
In 2017, Waterloo was named by Safewise.com as the 12th Safest City In America (with population over 10,000).

<text>Litchfield is a city in Montgomery County, Illinois, United States. The population was 6,605 at the 2020 census. It is located in South Central Illinois, south of Springfield, the state capital.

==History== 
Litchfield was platted in October 1853, and was originally named &quot;Huntsville&quot;, 

Earlier, Hardinsburg, about to the southwest, had been founded about 1850. Both towns were created in anticipation of the Terre Haute &amp; Alton Railroad. Hardinsburg grew to about 50 people by 1854; but when it became clear that the railroad was going through Huntsville instead of Hardinsburg, many of the buildings in Hardinsburg were pulled across the prairie on runners to Huntsville beginning in January 1854, and most of the residents moved to the new site as well, becoming Litchfield&#x27;s first residents. The railroad reached Huntsville in the autumn of 1864, and within two more years Hardinsburg had substantially disappeared.

The new town of Huntsville was renamed in November 1855 after Electus Bachus Litchfield, who with his brothers earlier that year had donated land and convinced the railroad of where to place its shops and terminals.

The residents of Litchfield first voted to incorporate as a village on April 4, 1856. However, the village trustees failed to complete the incorporation; the village charter was dissolved in autumn of 1857 and the trustees closed the books for that village government on January 22, 1858. The state legislature granted a new municipal charter to Litchfield on February 16, 1859, and the first elections under that charter were held on March 7, 1859.

Milnot Company, known for its namesake product, Milnot, an evaporated filled milk, was founded in Litchfield in 1912 as the Litchfield Creamery Company by Martin Jensen. In 1916, a new plant was built at 120 W. St. John St. and operated until 1990. As of 2019, it has been repurposed as an indoor sports training facility.

==Geography==
Litchfield is in western Montgomery County, west of Hillsboro, the Montgomery county seat. Interstate 55 runs along the western edge of the city, with access from Exit 52 (Illinois Route 16).

The city drains east to the West Fork of Shoal Creek, a south-flowing tributary of the Kaskaskia River.

<text>Jacksonville is a city and the county seat of Morgan County, Illinois, United States. The population was 17,616 at the 2020 census, down from 19,446 in 2010. It is home to Illinois College, Illinois School for the Deaf, and the Illinois School for the Visually Impaired, and was formerly home to MacMurray College. Jacksonville is the principal city of the Jacksonville Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Morgan and Scott counties.

==History==
Jacksonville was established by European Americans on a tract of land in the center of Morgan County in 1825, two years after the county was founded. The founders of Jacksonville were settlers from New England. They were descended from the English Puritans who had settled New England in the 1600s and were part of a wave of New England farmers who headed west into what was then the wilds of the Northwest Territory during the early 1800s. Most of them arrived as a result of the completion of the Erie Canal and the end of the Black Hawk War. When they arrived in what is now Jacksonville, there was nothing but dense virgin forest and wild prairie. The &quot;Yankee&quot; New Englanders laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes. They brought with them values such as a passion for education, establishing many schools, as well as staunch support for abolitionism. They were mostly members of the Congregationalist Church, though some were Episcopalian. Due to the Second Great Awakening, some of them had converted to Methodism and Presbyterianism, while some others became Baptist, before moving to what is now Jacksonville. Jacksonville, like some other parts of Illinois, would be culturally very continuous with early New England culture for most of its early history.

The town was laid out on a treeless prairie and along a state road that ran from Springfield to the Illinois River.

The town grew at a rapid rate, and a town square was quickly developed. In 1829, the Presbyterian Reverend John M. Ellis worked to found a new &quot;seminary of learning&quot; in the new state of Illinois. A group of Congregational students at Yale College heard about his plans and headed westward to establish the new school. These students were a part of the famous &quot;Yale Bands&quot;, groups of students who established several colleges in the frontier, what is now the Midwest. Illinois College was one of the first institutions of higher learning in the Midwest. A new courthouse was built on the square, churches were constructed, railroads were planned, and stores and taverns were built. By 1834, Jacksonville had the largest population of any city in the state of Illinois, vastly outnumbering Chicago (only founded the year before). In the 1830s, the town was on the path of Native Americans who were being forcibly removed by the federal government to west of the Mississippi. The Potawatomi passed through here in 1838 on what they called their Trail of Death as they were forced from their traditional homelands to the dry and barren Indian Territory to the west.

Jacksonville&#x27;s education complex and standing in the state were developed by the establishment of state institutions: the Illinois School for the Deaf and what is now called the Illinois School for the Visually Impaired. The Illinois Conference Female Academy was founded for education for girls; it later developed as MacMurray College. By 1850, Illinois College had issued Illinois&#x27; first college degrees and opened the first medical school in the state. Because of this, Jacksonville earned the nickname of &quot;Athens of the West&quot;.

In 1851, Illinois opened its first state mental hospital in Jacksonville; it became a major employer for the area.

The attorney Abraham Lincoln occasionally had legal business in Jacksonville, frequently acting either as co-counsel or opposing counsel with David A. Smith, a Jacksonville resident. In what is now Central Park, Lincoln delivered a strong antislavery speech on September 6, 1856, in support of the presidential campaign of John C. Frémont, lasting over two hours. A mural depicting the event has been painted on the side of a building at the southwest corner of the square.

Built in 1840, the Woodlawn Farm became an important stop on the Underground Railroad for runaway slaves escaping the terrors of slavery in the South. This historical site is open to tours in the summer.

One of Lincoln&#x27;s early political rivals, Stephen A. Douglas settled in Jacksonville in 1833 where he first got involved in local politics. He quickly rose the ranks of Illinois politics and was elected to the House of Representatives in 1842.

===1900 to present===
Between 1892 and 1910, Jacksonville was home to minor league baseball, as the Jacksonville Jacks and Jacksonville Lunatics played in eight different minor leagues. Jacksonville teams played at League Park on Finley Street.

In 1911 as part of the progressive movement, Jacksonville adopted the city commission form of government, the first mayor being George W. Davis.

In the summer of 1965, in order to keep up with customer demand for records by the Beatles, the wildly popular English band, Capitol Records opened a vinyl record pressing plant on the western outskirts of Jacksonville, at 1 Capitol Way. The plant produced a number of highly collectible pressings. This plant eventually served the Capitol Records Club, producing vinyl LPs and later audiocassettes, CDs, and DVDs of a number of artists.

At its peak, operating as EMI Records (owner of Capitol), the plant employed over 1,000 workers. It was a significant location in the music industry. For example, all seven albums released by country western artist Garth Brooks sold more than 50 million copies. EMI held a &quot;thank-you&quot; luncheon for 1,000 workers at the Jacksonville plant on March 10, 1995. A decade later, in 2004 EMI ceased manufacturing operations at Jacksonville.

==Notable people==
==Culture==
In 2005, Sufjan Stevens released &quot;Illinois&quot;, a concept album making reference to various people and places associated with the state. Its fifth track, &quot;Jacksonville,&quot; refers to various landmarks in the town, such as Nichols Park. It also contains a story about A. W. Jackson, a &quot;colored preacher&quot; urban legend supposes the town is named after, as well as President Andrew Jackson (President from 1829 to 1837) after whom the town&#x27;s officials say it is actually named.

The Grammy-winning album &quot;Stones in the Road&quot; by singer-songwriter Mary Chapin Carpenter features the song &quot;John Doe #24&quot; that describes a series of events that occurred in Jacksonville relating to the person on whose life the song is based. The song tells the story of a blind and deaf man who was found wandering the streets in Jacksonville in 1945. The man was hospitalized for diabetes and kept in various institutions until he died nearly 50 years later in 1993. During his 48 years of institutionalization, nobody ever found out his name, nor did anyone who knew or was related to him come to Jacksonville to establish his identity. It was speculated that he was originally from New Orleans, but this was never verified. Likewise, how he came to Jacksonville remains a mystery to this day.

Cultural offerings include the Jacksonville Symphony Orchestra, the Jacksonville Theatre Guild, the Art Association of Jacksonville and its David Strawn Art Gallery, as well as many public events and activities hosted by MacMurray College and Illinois College. Recent additions to the cultural scene include the Imagine Foundation and the Eclectic art gallery, both located in the city&#x27;s downtown. The Jacksonville Area Museum, located just outside the downtown area, is home to many historical artifacts and is the repository of the MacMurray College Archive collection.

Jacksonville also holds the unusual distinction of having a large number of pipe organs for a city of its size – eleven in all – found at various local churches, as well as both of its four-year colleges.

A notable Portuguese American community has existed on the outskirts of Jacksonville since the nineteenth century. The origins of this community can be traced to 1838, when a Scottish reverend named Robert Reid Kalley visited the Portuguese island of Madeira and converted a number of the locals to Protestantism. These Madeiran Protestants faced discrimination and alienation due to being Protestant in a largely Catholic community, causing the converts to relocate from Madeira to the Caribbean island of Trinidad before coming to the United States in 1849 and settling near Jacksonville.

==Attractions==
Jacksonville Speedway is a dirt racetrack on the Morgan County Fairgrounds that was first established in 1912. The track was originally a flat 1/2 mile track but was later replaced by the current banked 1/4 mile configuration. Though the racetrack was close to closing its doors in the early 2010s, it attracted the World of Outlaws racing series which attracted lots of fans and increased business. It has a grandstand that can seat 2,000 people. 

Nichols Park is a park on the south side of Jacksonville. It has a playground, golf course, lake, and community pool.

During the month of December, The Farmers State Bank and Trust building in downtown Jacksonville can be seen displaying the &quot;World&#x27;s Tallest Advent Calendar&quot; by displaying the 24 days leading up to Christmas in the windows of the East side of the building.

<doc id="111749" wikidata="Q575190" url="?curid=111749" title="Sullivan, Illinois">
<text>Sullivan is the largest city and the county seat of Moultrie County, Illinois, United States. The population was 4,413 at the time of the 2020 census. Sullivan is named after Sullivan&#x27;s Island, South Carolina, where Fort Moultrie is located.

==History==

Sullivan was founded in 1845 as Asa&#x27;s Point. Two years after Sullivan was founded, the first official courthouse of the county was built. It was a simple two-story brick building with a hipped roof, and the county jail was housed in the basement. The village would come alive with gossip when court was in session. Abraham Lincoln passed through this first courthouse many times from 1849 to 1852, as he practiced law in the Moultrie County circuit court. The present courthouse (the county&#x27;s third) contains a mural depicting this first courthouse.

In the opinion of early local leaders, Sullivan was not a logical site for a county seat. The village of Nelson (which no longer exists) had already been developed, and the prairie on which Sullivan would be built lacked proper drainage and was a breeding ground for malaria-carrying mosquitoes. In 1844, however, it was determined that centrally-located Sullivan was to be the county seat.

The original village consisted of (25 city blocks) bounded by Jackson Street on the north, Water Street on the south, Douglas (now Worth) Street on the east, and Hamilton Street on the west. Sullivan&#x27;s first school was built in 1846, with the first church being built in 1848.

When Abraham Lincoln was campaigning for the state senate against Stephen A. Douglas, he gave a speech in Freeland Grove (now the Sullivan Civic Center parking lot). Freeland Grove was bounded by Wyman Park, Main Street, Strain Street, and Worth Street. A small monument facing Wyman Park near Main Street commemorates Lincoln&#x27;s 1858 speech. During this campaign, a riot broke out on the town square between the supporters of Lincoln and the supporters of Douglas.

In 1864, a fire destroyed the first courthouse and a second, larger one was built that was in use until 1904, when it was demolished and the third, present-day courthouse was built. Along with the first courthouse building, hundreds of county records were lost.

Sullivan was home to the Titus Opera House, built in 1871, which was located on the north side of the town square. On the second and third floors of the building, the large auditorium, balcony, and box seats could accommodate up to 800 patrons. The opera house was among the finest in the area, and it hosted a concert given by the great Venezuelan pianist Teresa Carreño. The opera house was built by a businessman and Civil War veteran named Joseph Titus as both an attraction for high society and a &quot;playground&quot; for his young daughter, Winifred, who grew up to become a talented pianist and singer. She toured Europe during her career, even performing at the legendary Palais Garnier in Paris. In the early morning of February 20, 1910, the Titus Opera House caught fire and tragically burned to the ground. This marked the end of a live entertainment era in Sullivan until Guy S. Little Jr. founded The Little Theatre on the Square decades later.

Wyman Park, one of two parks on the north side of Sullivan, has an intriguing past. Albert Wyman, a man who immigrated to the United States from Germany, owned a shoe repair and sales shop on the west end of the town square. During the time Wyman was alive, Sullivan lacked a public park, so in his will he endowed much of his business profit to the city in order to purchase land for a park. While Wyman&#x27;s will prohibited any kind of sales from occurring on the grounds of the new park, concession stands were built next to the baseball diamonds in the 1960s.

The Moultrie County Historical and Genealogical Society, formerly located in downtown Sullivan, now on the southern end of town on South Hamilton Street, houses a small museum of the county&#x27;s past.

==Geography==
Sullivan is located south of the center of Moultrie County. Illinois Routes 32 and 121 pass through the city center. IL 121 leads northwest to Decatur and southeast to Mattoon, while IL 32 leads north to Lovington and south to Windsor.

==Education==
Sullivan is home to Sullivan Community Unit School District 300 which includes Sullivan High School, where the sports teams have the name &quot;Redskins.&quot;

The official school song is Northwestern University&#x27;s &quot;Go Northwestern,&quot; and the fight song is entitled &quot;Hail Red and Black.&quot; The school fight song has lyrics written by a Sullivan High School alumnus, but the music was composed by Dr. Paul Van Buskirk Yoder, a notable composer, arranger, and band director of the twentieth century.

==Points of interest==
===The Little Theatre on the Square===
The Little Theatre on the Square in Sullivan is a non-profit; it received $20,000 from President Barack Obama&#x27;s 2009 economic stimulus package. In 2013, it received $23,200 from the Illinois Arts Council for general operating expenses.

===Abraham Lincoln Memorial===
When Abraham Lincoln was campaigning for senate against Stephen A. Douglas, he gave a speech on September 20, 1858, in Freeland&#x27;s Grove (now Wyman Park), and today there is a monument commemorating his speech at the approximate location.

=== Huntsburger Hood Ornament Collection===
A sample of the 700+ vintage hood ornaments of Lynn Huntsburger&#x27;s collection, located in the board room of the Elizabeth Titus Memorial Library.

===Ward Museum===
The Ward Museum at Mason Point, a nursing home just east of Sullivan, displays a collection of items collected from around the world by the Ward family, including one of the largest collections of seashells in the nation. The Wards&#x27; collection went on display in 1948, and the collection has remained intact since then. It was featured on an episode of the TV show &quot;Illinois Adventure&quot;. The museum was established by Abraham Lincoln &quot;Link&quot; Ward, a farmer, livestock dealer, and auctioneer, as well as his wife, Cora Anne (Hinterly) Ward. In addition to seashells, the museum contains over 1,000 pieces of antique glassware, including 400 antique goblets. Frontier life items include wooden wheel clocks, circa 1830, copper-toed shoes, spinning wheels, and broadaxes. The museum was established in 1948; Cora Ward died in 1967, and the executor of her estate burned the catalog compilation, so the origin of the over 5,000 items donated by the couple, who travelled widely, is unknown.

===Nixon rally and buffalo burger===
During the 1960 presidential election, then-Vice President Richard Nixon held a campaign rally in Sullivan. He discarded a half-eaten buffalo burger that was the product of the slaughter of buffalo owned by the City of Sullivan and housed at their street maintenance facility. The discarded burger was retrieved by Sullivan resident Steve Jenne, who preserved it. Jenne exhibited the burger on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; in 1988 and was a guest on &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; in 2006.

==History==
Mt. Morris is home of the Illinois Freedom Bell, which is located in the town square. The area that is now the town square used to be the campus of one of Illinois&#x27; first institutes of higher learning, Mount Morris College. It was first a Methodist school and was later affiliated with the Church of the Brethren. The college closed due to hard economic times. The village&#x27;s old Junior High School, while undergoing demolition, caught fire and burned forcing the school district to be merged with the Oregon School District in 1993. On February 12, 2004, the Rahn Elementary School was lost to fire. This resulted in the reorganization of the Oregon School District. The former Oregon city elementary and middle schools were merged into a single elementary school. The Mt. Morris Highschool has since been used as the middle school for the district. The town is also home of a very large group of lustron homes in IL. These can be located on First street (5 houses), Hannah avenue (3 houses), and Sunset lane (5 houses). The town has a total of 18 lustrons. The houses were built here to meet a shortage of housing for a local printing company.

<text>Oregon ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Ogle County, Illinois, United States. The population was 3,721 in 2010.

==History==
The land Oregon, Illinois was founded on was previously held by the Potawatomi and Winnebago Indian tribes. In fact, later, settlers discovered that the area contained a large number of Indian mounds, most in diameter.

Ogle County was a New England settlement. The original founders of Oregon and Rochelle consisted entirely of settlers from New England. These people were &quot;Yankees&quot;, that is to say they were descended from the English Puritans who settled New England in the 1600s. They were part of a wave of New England farmers who headed west into what was then the wilds of the Northwest Territory during the early 1800s. Most of them arrived as a result of the completion of the Erie Canal. When they arrived in what is now Bureau County there to forest and prairie ecosystems, the New Englanders laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes. They brought with them many of their Yankee New England values, such as a passion for education, establishing many schools as well as staunch support for abolitionism. They were mostly members of the Congregationalist Church though some were Episcopalian. Culturally Bureau County, like much of northern Illinois would be culturally very continuous with early New England culture, for most of its history.

The first European to visit the land was pioneer John Phelps. Phelps first visited the area in 1829 and returned in 1833 hoping to find a suitable site to settle. Phelps found a forest and river-fed valley which impressed him enough that he built his cabin there. Other pioneers followed Phelps to this site, and Phelps helped create the first church, school, grocery store, blacksmith shop, and post office in Oregon. By December 4, 1838, due in large part to the efforts of Phelps and his brothers B.T. Phelps and G.W. Phelps, the land was claimed, subdivided and certified by the Ogle County clerk as Oregon City. The name Oregon means &quot;River of the West&quot;.

In 1839, Oregon City was renamed Florence after a visitor compared the scenic beauty of the Rock River to the Italian city of the same name. Florence was used for only about three years when the city opted to revert to its original name, without the word &quot;city,&quot; in 1843. By 1847 the town had a general store, sawmill, ferry, 44 households and a population of 225. The population continued to grow through the 1850s and 1860s, a fact demonstrated by the increasing number of churches in those decades and the building of a railroad in 1871. Industry followed the railroad and Oregon became home to an oatmeal mill, furniture factory, chair factory, flour mill and a foundry, Paragon Foundry, which operated until the 1960s.

The city of Oregon was first organized under an act of the Illinois General Assembly which was approved on April 1, 1869. By the 1870s the town of Oregon and nearby area was home to around 2,000 people. James Gale was elected the city&#x27;s first mayor on March 21, 1870 and four other men, Christian Lehman, W.W. Bennett, George M. Dwight and George P. Jacobs, were chosen as aldermen. On March 29, 1873 the city was reorganized because of an act of the Illinois legislature which allowed the municipalities to incorporate as cities and villages. In 1920, the Oregon City Hall was constructed on the perimeter of the city&#x27;s commercial district and it has been the center of city government ever since. The Ogle County Courthouse was built in 1891 on the corner of Washington Street and Fourth Street (Illinois Route 64 and Illinois Route 2).

Between 1908 and 1911, on a site just north of the city, sculptor Lorado Taft erected a 50-foot tall statue he had designed and originally named &quot;The Eternal Indian&quot;. Located on a bluff overlooking the Rock River valley, the sculpture is now known as the Black Hawk Statue, named after Black Hawk, a chief of the Sauk Indian tribe that once inhabited the area.

The city of Oregon annexed nearby Daysville, Illinois, in 1993.

===The Arts===
In 1898, sculptor Lorado Taft founded the Eagle&#x27;s Nest Art Colony on a bluff overlooking the Rock River, north of Oregon. Taft and his art colony began to exert an influence on the city of Oregon and its culture. The artists who gathered during the summer at Eagle&#x27;s Nest would leave a mark on the city below them. One result of the colony&#x27;s location near Oregon was the inclusion of a second story art gallery in the Oregon Public Library when it was built in 1908. Art colony members were required to contribute to the local culture by giving art shows, lectures and plays. In 1904, Taft created &quot;The Blind&quot; and then began focusing on more monumental works including &quot;The Eternal Indian&quot; located just north of Oregon in Illinois&#x27; Lowden State Park. Several other Taft works are located in and around Oregon, including The Soldiers&#x27; Monument on the courthouse lawn.

====Hub====
Rochelle is known as the &quot;Hub City&quot; because of its location at the intersection of several major transportation routes. The first transcontinental highway in the United States, the Lincoln Highway, passed through Rochelle, as did US-51, one of the first highways to go the full north–south length of the United States. Both these roads have diminished in importance (and are now state highways 38 and 251, respectively), but Rochelle continues to be crossed by major highways, especially Interstates 88 and 39. Besides roadways, Rochelle is also crossed by two major rail lines; the Union Pacific Railroad and BNSF Railway mainlines cross inside of the city limits. The effect, as seen on a map, was one of the spokes of an old wagon wheel meeting at the &quot;hub&quot;, and thus the nickname was born.

Several businesses carry the moniker &quot;Hub City&quot;, including furniture stores, shopping centers, realty firms, dry cleaners, and many others. Additionally, he local high school&#x27;s teams are known as the &quot;Hubs&quot;.

Rochelle was once a stop for passenger trains operated by the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy, and its successor, the Burlington Northern, such as &quot;North Coast Limited&quot;. The town saw its last passenger train in 1971, and in 2007, the depot, which had been built in 1921, was demolished.

<doc id="111765" wikidata="Q575467" url="?curid=111765" title="Chillicothe, Illinois">
<text>Chillicothe () is a city on the Illinois River in Peoria County, Illinois, United States. The population was 6,097 at the 2010 census. Chillicothe is just north of the city of Peoria and is part of the Peoria Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== Geography ==

Chillicothe is located at .

According to the 2010 census, Chillicothe has a total area of , of which (or 94.74%) is land and (or 5.26%) is water.

Chillicothe is located on the Illinois River and on the parallel Iowa Interstate Railroad (IAIS) branch, from Bureau to Peoria, which was formerly the Rock Island Railroad. Crossing the IAIS and the Illinois River at Chillicothe is the former Santa Fe Railroad, now owned by BNSF Railway.
Almost 4 miles outside of town the BNSF Railway operates one of the most notable civil engineering points on the Chillicothe Subdivision. Edelstein Hill is one of the steepest climbs on the railway system and attracts many railfans to see locomotives pulling intermodal trains up the hill.

The Illinois River runs both north and south connecting Chicago with St. Louis. Barge traffic is occasional as it is an efficient means of transportation for some bulk products. Eight miles to the north is Sparland and three miles to the south is Rome. Peoria is 20 miles to the south.

Chillicothe sits along the Illinois River Valley where gravel and sand from prehistoric river development sits. It is currently being dug up and is sold for construction and roadbeds. In Chillicothe there are relatively large service facilities and connections to the BNSF Railway.

Even though Chillicothe sits along a river valley, forests are very common. Marshall State Refuge sits to the north and Atchison Waterfowl Refuge in Woodford County. The bluffs that surround it are full of hunting spots and locations where deer are common. Duck hunting as well is popular in the waterfront sloughs and swamps to the north.

== History ==
The name &quot;Chillicothe&quot; comes from the name of the Chalahgawtha sect of the Shawnee nation.

Along with Peoria, Chillicothe grew due to river traffic and quickly became a stop for barge and railroad traffic traveling to and from Chicago and St. Louis.

In the late 1800s, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway was building its mainline from Chicago to Kansas City and selected Chillicothe as its crossing point of the Illinois River. The railroad quickly became an establishment in Chillicothe as a crew change point and a notable stop in Central Illinois. Chillicothe today still remains a key point on the Southern Transcon route between Chicago and Los Angeles with high frequency intermodal freight trains moving through daily.

On November 5, 1988, Vice President George H.W. Bush, Representative Robert H. Michel, &amp; Governor James Thompson stopped in Chillicothe to close out Election &#x27;88 in Illinois. Governor Thompson declared the day &quot;Ilion Crabel Day&quot; in honor of the city&#x27;s record breaking city clerk. Crabel, elected in 1923, served as city clerk for 66 years until 1989.

Chillicothe is the host to The Summer Camp Music Festival, a multi-day music festival created by Jay Goldberg Events &amp; Entertainment that is held annually at Three Sisters Park.

== Education ==
Chillicothe is served by the Illinois Valley Central Unit School District 321.

Chillicothe is the primary area served by the school district along with the neighboring towns of Rome, Mossville, Edelstein, and a part of the area near Dunlap.

Within the school district, there are three primary schools and two junior highs. South School serves the northern half of the school district (Grades PK-3). Chillicothe Junior High (CJH) serves the northern half of the school district (Grades 4–8) in Chillicothe proper while Mossville Junior High (Grades K-8) serves the southern part of the school district. In the Illinois Elementary School Association (IESA) both schools have made themselves known in multiple sports.

Illinois Valley Central High School (IVC) serves Chillicothe and is the home to the Grey Ghosts. IVCHS like its junior highs has made themselves known in the state in various activities. Most notably, the IVC Marching Grey Ghosts have accumulated 15 state titles since 1990, most recently in 2019. In the IHSA, IVC were 2006 Class A Baseball State Champions, 2006 Boys&#x27; Basketball Class A State Runners-up, 2006 Class A Scholastic Bowl State Runner-ups, 2008 Class AA Baseball State Runners-up, and most recently placed Third for Class AA Baseball in 2010.

Two private schools serve the Chillicothe area. Calvary Baptist Academy is a small, PK-12 school sponsored by Calvary Baptist Church. St. Edward&#x27;s is a PK-8 Catholic School sponsored by St. Edward Parish. In 2016, St. Edward was featured in regional news outlets for the &quot;Miracle in Chillicothe&quot; fundraising campaign that collected over $500,000 in one week to complete emergency repairs to the building roof.

==Transportation==
Illinois Route 29 runs through Chillicothe north to south and is a strong artery running between I-180 in the north and Peoria to the south.

Since its creation the railroad has connected Chillicothe to the outside world. The Rock Island Railroad (now Iowa Interstate Railroad) serves Chillicothe paralleling the Illinois River. The Rock Island Rockets used to serve Chillicothe connecting Peoria &amp; Chicago. As automobiles became more popular, the service was infrequently used. The last revenue service by the Peoria Rocket was on December 31, 1978.

Chillicothe was once a stop on the Santa Fe&#x27;s Super Chief (Chicago to Los Angeles) &amp; Texas Chief (Lone Star) (Chicago to Houston) on the section of the run between Chicago and Galesburg. It was also a stop on the Super Chief&#x27;s successor, the Southwest Limited/Southwest Chief. In 1996, however, following the merger of the Burlington Northern and the Santa Fe railroads to form the BNSF, and a connection put in between the Burlington Northern line from Chicago and the Santa Fe&#x27;s Chillicothe Subdivision at Cameron, Illinois, the Chief was rerouted to Galesburg over the BNSF&#x27;s Mendota Subdivision (also used by the California Zephyr) through Naperville, Princeton, and Mendota. The last revenue passenger service was on July 31, 1996.

Unlike its neighbors, Chillicothe&#x27;s crossing of the Illinois River throughout its history has primarily been via the railroad. At one time there was briefly a ferry service connecting residents of rural Woodford County during the 1920&#x27;s. However, any serious proposal to build a road crossing has never gained traction.

==History==
Glasford or Glasco as it was called in 1868, was named for its founder, Samual Alexander Glasford/Glassford (1824-1896).

Samuel A. Glasford, whom arrived in Peoria County in 1842 from Ohio and was one of the early settlers of Timber Township, had the foresight to off lots where cornfields once stood. When the railroad was built by his farm residence, Mr. Glasford had the hindsight to realize Lancaster, Illinois would seek the railroad and laid out the town December 9, 1868, which became incorporated as a village in 1889. Glasco would become a center of trade and population along the new route of the Toledo, Peoria and Warsaw Railroad, bringing many new settlers and stores to Glasco in 1868.

The town has been called by many names in different publications; Glasford, Glassford, Glasco, and Glasgow, just as his name in Scotland where is father, Lord William Glasford was born, is Glassford but in America it was written as Glasford.

Farmer Jonathan Tharp, who came from Ohio, was the first non-native American resident of what would become Pekin, building a log cabin in 1824 on a ridge above the Illinois River at a site near the present foot of Broadway Drive. Franklin School was later erected near this site. Other settlers soon joined him, including his father Jacob Tharp who arrived from Ohio in 1825. They lived near Chief Shabbona&#x27;s large Indian village of about 100 wigwams, populated primarily by Potawatomi, which was situated along Gravel Ridge, on the eastern shore of what is today Pekin Lake in northwest Pekin.

The county surveyor, William Hodge, measured and laid out a &quot;town site&quot; in 1827. In 1829, the plat was taken to Springfield and auctioned; the town site was awarded to Major Isaac Perkins, Gideon Hawley, William Haines and Major Nathan Cromwell. Major Cromwell&#x27;s wife, Mrs. Ann Eliza Cromwell, selected the name of Pekin. It has been stated that Mrs. Cromwell named the town &quot;Pekin&quot; because she thought Peking was on the exact opposite side of the world from the town she founded. In the 1800s, China and the United States were thought to be antipodes, or locations that were exactly opposite of each other on the globe. As such, towns were sometimes named after their supposedly antipodal locations. Another example is Canton, Ohio. &quot;Peking&quot; was often romanized as &quot;Pekin&quot;, as in other towns founded during the 1800s (such as Pekin, Ohio).

Nathan Cromwell named many of the city streets after the wives and daughters of early Pekin settlers. It was long held, as first expressed by W.H. Bates in the 1870 Pekin City Directory, that Cromwell was assisted by his wife Ann Eliza in the naming of the streets.

===19th century===
Pekin&#x27;s first post office opened on February 20, 1832.

In July 1834, Pekin suffered a cholera outbreak. Several early settlers died in the outbreak and were buried in the old Tharp cemetery. There was also a scarlet fever outbreak in winter 1843–1844.

==== Pre-Civil War ====
Pekin was the residence of Nance Costley, known to history as the first enslaved person to be freed with the help of Abraham Lincoln. She was auctioned off to Nathan Cromwell in 1827 and brought to Pekin. Her original case was part of a Probate Court hearing regarding the estate when he died in 1836. David Bailey, a local merchant of abolitionist leanings, sought the help of an attorney friend after he (and Nance) lost the case. Abraham Lincoln argued the case in 1841 at the Illinois Supreme Court, citing the Illinois Constitution and Northwest Ordinance. Justice Breese determined that Nance was a free person and reversed the Circuit Court ruling, stating that &quot;it is a presumption of law, in the State of Illinois, that every person is free, without regard to color,&quot; and &quot;the sale of a free person is illegal&quot;. After her freedom was legally secured, she remained in Pekin with her husband and children. In William H. Bates&#x27; 1870 Pekin City Directory, Nance was included in an entry of notable citizens:&quot;With the arrival of Major Cromwell ... came a slave. That slave still lives in Pekin and is now known, as she has been known for nearly half a century ... (as) &#x27;Black Nancy.&#x27; She came here a chattel. ... But she has outlived the age of barbarism, and now, in her still vigorous old age, she sees her race disenthralled; the chains that bound them forever broken, their equality before the law everywhere recognized and her children enjoying the elective franchise.&quot;Lincoln attended the Whig Convention that was held in Pekin on May 1, 1843. He was among several local Whig politicians who wanted to serve in the U.S. Congress. To keep from splitting the Whig vote, the competitors agreed to support each other for one term each in Congress. Lincoln ran and was elected to the 30th United States Congress in 1846, and retired at the end of the term. This single term in Congress was Lincoln&#x27;s only experience in Washington before he was elected president.

Although Illinois was a &quot;free&quot; state, pro-slavery sentiment was predominant throughout southern and central Illinois, which had been largely settled by Southerners, some of whom were slaveholders before the state was admitted to the union. Cities with pro-slavery sentiment included Peoria and Pekin. According to the 1949 Pekin &quot;Centenary,&quot; p. 15,
&quot;Pekin was a pro-slave city for years. Some of the original settlers had been slave-owners themselves, and the overwhelming sentiment in Pekin was Democratic. Stephen A. Douglas, not Abraham Lincoln, was the local hero, although Lincoln was well-liked, and had some German following.&quot;

Nonetheless, there was abolitionist sentiment in Pekin. Among Pekin&#x27;s abolitionist leaders was Dr. Daniel Cheever, who performed Underground Railroad activities in his office at the corner of Capitol and Court streets (in addition to his property in Delavan which was an Underground Railroad depot) and the brothers Samuel and Hugh Woodrow. (Catherine Street in Pekin is named for Samuel&#x27;s wife, and Amanda Street is named for Hugh&#x27;s wife). The sentiment was bolstered by the German immigrants that arrived in the area after the Revolutions of 1848; while there were small groups that supported slavery, finding them would prove difficult as the German community disapproved of the idea.

==== Civil War ====
During the Civil War, the inhabitants of Pekin were divided between the pro-slavery element, who favored the Confederacy, and the abolitionist and pro-Union element. Early in the war, the secessionist &quot;Knights of the Golden Circle&quot; openly supported secession and slavery in Pekin. The 1949 &quot;Pekin Centenary,&quot; p. 15, says the Knights were &quot;aggressive and unprincipled,&quot; and &quot;those who believed in the Union spoke often in whispers in Pekin streets and were wary and often afraid.&quot; As a response to the Knights&#x27; influence, Dr. Cheever and 10 other men gathered at 331 Court Street in Pekin on June 25, 1862, to establish the first council of the Union League of America. The goal of the League was to promote patriotism and loyalty to the Union in the Civil War and the abolition of slavery. Its members hoped to counter Northern disillusionment with President Lincoln&#x27;s military policies after early Union defeats in the American Civil War. Although closely allied with the Republican Party, the League sought to enroll all Union supporters, regardless of party. The anti-slavery Germans of Pekin took an active role in the Union League in their city.

==== German immigration to Pekin ====
After the Revolutions of 1848, many people from the German Confederation immigrated to the United States. During the decade of the 1850s, a 118.6% increase in the German-born population was observed. In the 1850 Tazewell County census, nearly 14% of Pekin&#x27;s population was listed as originating from &quot;Germany&quot; (272 individuals of the 1,891 listed). In the 1860 Tazewell County census, the portion of Pekin that originated from Germany increased to 22% (774 individuals of the 3,467 listed). The 1860 census also changed the designation from &quot;Germany&quot; to the various states of the German Confederation- revealing that 31% of the German immigrants came from Hanover, with Darmstadt trailing behind at 22% of the population.

Several German citizens of Pekin held status in the town. Frederick P. Siebens, who came to Pekin in 1868, was stockholder and director of T. &amp; H. Smith Company (a blacksmith, woodworking, and wagon building plant). He was also listed as a foreman blacksmith in the 1887 Pekin City Directory. John Herget moved to the United States from Hesse-Darmstadt, then returned to Germany and brought his family back with him to Pekin in 1869. He became a stockholder in Farmers National Bank and was Mayor of Pekin in 1873 and 1874. John&#x27;s younger brother, George Herget, was the President of the Globe Distilling Company, the Pekin Electric Light Company, and the Pekin Steam Coopering Company. He settled in Pekin in 1853 after traveling from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The historic Carl Herget mansion was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Habbe Vander Velde, one of the original founders of T. &amp; H. Smith Company, served several terms on Pekin&#x27;s city council, was Chairman of the Finance Committee, and a member of the Committee on Bridges and Licenses. He moved to Pekin in 1851. Aeilt Van Boening was the city&#x27;s representative for the Anheuser-Busch Brewing Company of St. Louis. He moved to Pekin in 1867 to be with his brothers, who had settled there in 1866. Van Boening was also listed as a proprietor for City Truck Line in the 1887 Pekin City Directory.

George Herget and Habbe Vander Velde were among those on the &quot;Roll of Honor&quot; in the 1908 Pekin City Directory. Those who were listed were in the 1861 Pekin City Directory and lived continuously or retained citizenship in Pekin since. The list describes those listed to &quot;represent all the varied trades and professions which were essential to the building up of our beautiful city&quot;.

In 1852, a short-lived German language newspaper &quot;Per Wachteram Illinois&quot; was published. Circa 1875, John Hoffman started a German weekly called the &quot;Pekin Freie Press&quot;. This publication was sold to Albert Weiss, then to Jacob Schmidt in 1914. During World War I, this newspaper was changed to English language and renamed it &quot;Free Press&quot;; it was published until 1934.

The northern part of town was known as &quot;Bean Town&quot;. Before World War I, German was a second language in Pekin, some stores had signs indicating &quot;German Spoken Here&quot;, and some churches offered German services. Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church conducted some services in German for the older members in this section of town.

==== Railroad ====
The St. Louis, Peoria and Northern Railway (St. L. P. &amp; N.) built a line into Pekin in 1898, constructing the Pekin Depot.
===20th century===
The Pekin Federal Building was built in 1906 to house government offices, including the post office on the first floor. The post office moved in 1966.

==== Ku Klux Klan ====
In an early 20th-century revival, the Ku Klux Klan recruited new members as a fraternal organization, opposing new immigrants from southern and eastern Europe, and becoming influential in rapidly industrializing urban areas in the Midwest and West, as well as in the South. It had numerous members in Pekin and other Illinois cities. In August 1924, the Pekin Klan hosted one of the largest &quot;monster rallies&quot; ever held in Illinois, with an estimated attendance of 25,000 to 45,000. It was during this period that leading Klansmen took over ownership of the city newspaper, the &quot;Pekin Daily Times&quot;; they used it as an organ of Klan viewpoints. The Klan owned the paper from September 1923 to June 1925; they sold off the paper within a few years, coinciding with their decline in membership.

==== 1936 General Strike ====
In February 1936, Pekin held a city-wide strike, only the fourth strike of its kind in United States history.

==== Civil Rights era ====
The city had an identity and reputation as a sundown town; it was known to be hostile to black residents and few settled there. On the other hand, some Pekin church pastors participated in the civil rights marches of the 1960s, and U.S. Senator Everett Dirksen from Pekin was integral to achieving passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The &quot;Effingham Daily News&quot; published an article on Peoria attorney Joe Billy McDade on December 16, 1967, that addressed the sundown town policy, in which McDade alleged that Pekin posted a sign its border that read, &quot;Nigger, don&#x27;t let the sun set on you in Pekin.&quot; The article further states, &quot;There must be a thousand Negroes in Peoria who could have known that is NOT true.&quot;

=== 21st century ===
In 1995, Pekin became the first city in Illinois to develop an overlay zoning ordinance to protect groundwater. In 2011, Laurie Barra became the first female mayor of Pekin.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, the city has a total area of , of which (or 96.17%) is land and (or 3.83%) is water.

Pekin lies on the Illinois River, and its John T. McNaughton Bridge connects the city to a small area of land the city has annexed in Peoria County. Nearby towns include North Pekin, Marquette Heights, Creve Coeur, Groveland, Tremont, Morton, Washington, Lincoln, East Peoria, Peoria, Bartonville, Mapleton, Manito, Delavan, Dillon, Green Valley, Hopedale, and South Pekin.

=== Climate ===
Pekin, much like the rest of central Illinois, experiences a hot-summer continental climate. Summers are warm to hot and humid with occasional heat waves. Winters are cold (sometimes severely) and snowy, though there are plenty of clear days in the winter. There is no &quot;dry&quot; season- precipitation is evenly distributed throughout the year, though late spring may be wetter than the rest of the year. July is the warmest month, while January is the coolest.

==Economy==

=== Coal mining ===
All of the coal that exists in the area formed about 300 million years ago; dead plant matter was buried, compressed, and subjected to heat and pressure during this time to create rocks full of coal. Since coal was cheaper than wood fuel and produced more energy, it became very popular and profitable to mine. In Pekin, there were at least four coal mines that existed: the Pekin Coal Mine, Regal Coal Mine, Tazewell Coal Mine, and Ubben Coal Mine.

The Ubben Coal Mine began in 1900 and was run by the Ubben Coal Company until 1903, when Tazewell Coal Company took over production until the mine permanently closed in 1925. Over the course of 25 years, the mine produced 2,089,332 tons of coal. This mine was located south of Pekin Community High School&#x27;s eastern campus at S6 T24 R4W. Ubben also managed a second mine from 1911 to 1938 that was originally started by Louis Grant in 1891; they produced 928,146 tons of coal during their ownership, with a total of 1,217,196 tons overall. This mine was located near Meyer&#x27;s Lake (formerly Lake Arlan) at S1 T24N R5W.

The Pekin Coal Mining Company (also known as Schaefer&#x27;s Mining Company) owned a mine (originally managed by David Grant) from 1939 to 1952, and produced 898,610 tons of coal during its ownership. This was a large mine, located under Broadmoor Junior High School, Willow Elementary School, and Schramm School at S36 T25N R5W. When Fred Schaefer died, the mine was inspected and discovered to be unsafe. By 1951, the coal mining business had ended for Pekin.

The Regal Coal Mine was managed by the Regal Coal Company from 1920 to 1924, until it went out of business in 1925. It produced 102,287 tons of coal during this time. It crossed Broadway Street in the eastern part of town, with the southern half of the mine existing underneath the Parkway Golf Course and Coal Miner&#x27;s Park at S6 T24N R4W.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons operates the Federal Correctional Institution, Pekin.

== Arts and culture ==

=== Marigold Festival ===
The Marigold Festival is an annual event founded in 1973 to honor Everett Dirksen, a senator from Pekin. While in the United States Congress, Dirksen tried to have the marigold named as the national floral emblem. In support of Dirksen, the community began growing marigolds. While unsuccessful in the national flower contest, Dirksen&#x27;s hometown of Pekin became known as the &quot;Marigold Capital of the World&quot;. The Marigold Festival occurs on the first weekend after Labor Day in September. Activities include the Marigold Parade, the crowning of Miss Marigold, live music, and an arts and crafts fair.

=== Pekin Public Library ===
In the beginning, Pekin&#x27;s library was organized by the Ladies Library Association. The purpose of this library was &quot;not only to collect and establish a library of select and useful works, but also to promote a literary taste by encouraging lectures, holding discussions, etc.&quot; Both the membership and collection outgrew their space, and it relocated twice; to the city firehouse in 1889 and the Steinmetz Building in 1899. Due to the increase in membership, the Association&#x27;s board decided to inquire about the library becoming a free city library. In 1896, the city council agreed to make the library free and appointed a nine-member board of trustees.

In 1900, board member Mary Gaither wrote to Andrew Carnegie, a philanthropist who was funding libraries for communities all over the country. With donated land from George Herget and $15,000 from Carnegie, a new library was finally built in 1902. However, continued growth of the collection and increased usage resulted in the need to expand the library, and the Carnegie library was demolished in 1974. A larger building was constructed in September 1974 and was the original home of the Dirksen Congressional Center (which later separated from the library and built its own facility in 2002).

In 1973, President Richard Nixon traveled to Pekin at the request of Senator Dirksen&#x27;s widow to dedicate the cornerstone of the new library.

In 1995, the Illinois State Library nominated Pekin Public Library for the American Library Association&#x27;s Bessie Boehm Moore Award for their networking opportunities, intergenerational programs that engaged all groups of the community, and services for the elderly.

==Parks and recreation==
The Pekin Park District is the second largest in the region (Peoria is the first) with in 13 parks. It is the fifth largest parks district in the state. It is perhaps best known for Mineral Springs Park and its iconic restored pavilion. The park has a lagoon for fishing and paddle boats, sports fields, skating rink, skateboard park, Dragonland Water Park, miniature golf, and a dog park.

McNaughton Park has hiking trails, a disc golf course, and horse trails. Riverfront Park has a viewing platform along the Illinois River.

Pekin has two golf courses, Parkview and Lick Creek, as well as a country club.

There is a bike trail.

==Government==
Pekin is the county seat of Tazewell County, Illinois. Originally under an aldermanic form of government, the city switched to the commission form in 1911 (see &quot;Pekin Sesquicentennial 1824–1974, A History&quot;, p. 162), but since 1995 has had a city manager form of government. A mayor and six council members are elected to staggered 4-year terms in April of odd-numbered years. Candidates may start circulating nomination papers (available from the County Clerk&#x27;s office) in September, but must file them in mid-December.

The historic Tazewell County Courthouse houses the 10th Circuit Court.

The Pekin Park District was established in 1902 and still operates, controlled by a 7-member Board of Commissioners elected by the public at the same elections the city council members are.

While Illinois as a whole is represented in the Senate by Richard Durbin (D) and Tammy Duckworth (D), the state is split into 17 Congressional Districts for the House of Representatives. Pekin is split between Congressional Districts 16 and 17- the majority of Pekin is in District 16 and represented by Darrin LaHood (R). Extreme southwestern Pekin is in District 17 and represented by Eric Sorensen (D).

Regarding the Illinois Senate and Illinois House of Representatives, Pekin is split along County Road 1700 E into two districts for both. For the western division, Illinois Senate District 47 is represented by Neil Anderson (R) and Illinois House District 93 is represented by Travis Weaver (R). For the eastern division, Illinois Senate District 44 is represented by Sally J. Turner (R) and Illinois House District 87 is represented by William E. Hauter (R).


==Education==
The majority of Pekin is in Pekin Public School District 108, while other parts are in North Pekin-Marquette Heights School District 102 and Rankin Community School District 98. Portions in these districts, that is all of Pekin in Tazewell County, are zoned to Pekin Community High School District 303.

Pekin Public Schools District 108 consists of six elementary, two intermediate, two junior high schools, and the Pekin Technical Education Center. Pekin Community High School District 303 is the one high school- Pekin Community High School (PCHS). District 303 serves students living in surrounding areas such as South Pekin, North Pekin, Marquette Heights, Creve Coeur, and Groveland.

The portion of Pekin in Peoria County is in the Hollis Consolidated School District 328 and the Limestone Community High School District 310.

=== Pekin Community High School ===
The high school was built in 1915, and expanded multiple times to accommodate the growing student population. In 1959, the city planned to widen Eighth Street which ended future opportunities for continued expansion. Subsequently, the school district decided to build a second campus in 1962 and classes began in 1964. With the construction of the newer campus, PCHS was split into West Campus (original building) and East Campus (new building). Freshman and sophomores attended West Campus, while juniors and seniors attended East Campus. East Campus was expanded in 1997–1998, after which date West Campus closed and all four classes were reunited at the newer campus. After the local community lost in an attempt to save the original school building, demolition began in 2012 and was finished in 2014.

==Media==
The city is served by a daily newspaper, the &quot;Pekin Daily Times&quot;. In 1873, Joseph B. Irwin and Col. W.T. Dowdall founded the &quot;Pekin Times&quot;. They had a large task before them to revitalize the newspaper: &quot;When the first issue of the Times appeared [in 1873] there was no subscription list, as the paper had changed hands so often that its reputation was well nigh gone and the outlook was extremely discouraging. But by much hard work, natural ability and perseverance, our subject soon placed the paper on a solid basis, and as a newsy and literary production it ranked among the leading weeklies of the northwest&quot;. The &quot;Pekin Times&quot; remained a weekly publication until January 3, 1881, when Irwin turned the paper into a five-column daily. It has remained a Monday-Saturday publication ever since.

From September 1923 to June 1925, the paper was owned by Oscar W. Friedrich, a Ku Klux Klan Grand Titan. For several years, headlines were about the Klan&#x27;s meetings, policies, and plans. By the mid-1920s, the Klan&#x27;s power had declined and the paper was sold to F.F. McNaughton.

==Infrastructure==
CityLink provides bus service on Routes 17, 18 and 23 connecting Pekin to downtown Peoria and other destinations.

The Pekin Municipal Airport is a city-owned public-use facility located south of Pekin&#x27;s central business district.
