<text>Avondale Estates is a city in DeKalb County, Georgia, United States. The population was 3,567 in 2020. It is part of the Atlanta metropolitan area and is near Decatur.

==History==
In the 1890s, lots were sold in the area, which was known as Ingleside.

Avondale Estates was founded in 1924 by George Francis Willis, a patent medicine magnate, who purchased the entire village of Ingleside to create a planned community. The city was named after Stratford-upon-Avon, England, birthplace of Shakespeare. Downtown buildings were designed in a Tudor style to reinforce this image, as were many of the houses in the city. The city incorporated in 1927.

==Geography==
Avondale Estates is entirely underlain by granite, and clay-rich soil developed on it. Some of this granite can be seen outcropped along the shore of Lake Avondale.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which 0.88% is water.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 3,567 people, 1,422 households, and 865 families residing in the city.

==Arts and culture==
The mostly Tudor-style downtown area of Avondale Estates, known as the commercial district, is home to a variety of businesses including consignment stores. Pizza, southern comfort food, and Chicago style hot dogs are some of the restaurant fare options within the city limits. The city is the location of the first Waffle House restaurant which opened on Labor Day weekend in 1955 having been converted into a museum, along with an existing operational full-time Waffle House nearby, with numerous others in the Decatur, Georgia area as well. The Avondale Salad, featured on certain Waffle House lunch menus, derives its name from the city.

A selection of art galleries and studios are located in an area of the city known as the Rail Arts District. Little Tree Art Studios located on Franklin Street, is a warehouse that includes multiple artist studios and a music rehearsal space.

The movie, &quot;Instant Family&quot; (2018), starring Mark Wahlberg, was filmed in Avondale Estates.

==Government==
The city is governed by a mayor and a board of commissioners. Avondale Estates also has a city manager and other administrative positions. The city uses the DeKalb County Fire Service for fire and EMS calls, but provides its own police service.

The Avondale Estates Police Department (AEPD) has approximately 15 members providing around the clock coverage. Officers drive Dodge Chargers equipped with PIT bumpers, LED lights, in-car computers with e-tickets, and digital video cameras. City Court is held multiple times a month.

The Georgia Department of Juvenile Justice has its headquarters in Avondale Estates.

The United States Postal Service operates the Avondale Estates Post Office.

==Education==
Avondale Estates is served by the DeKalb County School System.

Avondale Elementary School is in the city limits. Druid Hills Middle School, and Druid Hills High School serve the community.

Avondale Middle School and Avondale High School, formerly adjacent to the city limits and serving the city, closed at the end of May 2011, and the students were distributed to neighboring schools. The campus is now used exclusively by the magnet school DeKalb School of the Arts.

In 2008, local parents began organizing formal efforts through the Avondale Education Association, a local grass-roots non-profit organization that was founded in October 2003, to create a charter school that would achieve the standards required by law, while establishing an elementary school that reflected the values of the community. Their proposal was initially rejected by the Dekalb County School Board, but it was subsequently selected by the Georgia Charter Schools Commission as one of a small number of schools to be chartered directly by the State of Georgia. The school, Museum School of Avondale Estates, opened in 2010, and Avondale Estates therefore lies within its attendance zone.
The Museum School admissions are accepted through a lottery.

<doc id="110034" wikidata="Q2527605" url="?curid=110034" title="Chamblee, Georgia">
<text>Chamblee ( ) is a city in northern DeKalb County, Georgia, United States, northeast of Atlanta. The population was 30,164 as of the 2020 census.

==History==
The area that would later become Chamblee was originally dairy farms. During the late nineteenth century, an intersection of two railroads was constructed in Chamblee; one carried passengers from Atlanta to Charlotte, North Carolina, while the other ferried workers and goods back and forth from a factory in Roswell to Atlanta. A settlement known as Roswell Junction emerged at the intersection, and the United States Postal Service decided to establish a post office there. However, feeling the name of the settlement was too similar to nearby Roswell, they randomly selected Chamblee from a list of petitioners for the new post office name. Chamblee was incorporated in 1907.

During World War I and World War II, Chamblee served as the site of U.S. military operations. During World War I, the U.S. operated Camp Gordon, home to 40,000 servicemen. This influx of new people created a building boom in the town. Camp Gordon was closed after the war and then re-opened as Navy Flight Training Center at the advent of World War II.

Immediately after World War II, Chamblee experienced growth in blue-collar industry and residents due to its proximity to the newly opened General Motors plant in neighboring Doraville. Manufacturing plants also located along the newly constructed Peachtree Industrial Boulevard. By the 1980s, much of the city&#x27;s industrial base had downsized or eroded; in its place sprang up multi-ethnic businesses that catered to the immigrants and refugees moving to Chamblee and Doraville en masse due to the cities&#x27; affordable housing. By the time of the 1996 Summer Olympics, Chamblee had emerged as a multi-cultural city inhabited by a large immigrant community.

During the first decade of the 2000s, the city grew as it refined its image, constructing a new city hall in 2002. In 2010, Chamblee annexed an area directly to the northwest that includes Huntley Hills and a resident population of approximately 5,000. It also renamed Peachtree Industrial Boulevard to Peachtree Boulevard, and took steps to revitalize its downtown. In 2012 the city had an annexation proposal that was voted down by a small margin. In November 2013 the city had another annexation proposal that was passed by voters. Following the annexation, the city and neighboring Brookhaven had a dispute in 2014 over which city would annex the Century Center development. The courts gave Century Center to Chamblee.

According to 2020 Census data, Chamblee effectively tripled its population since 2010. It started the decade with roughly 9,800 residents and ended it with more than 30,000, mostly due to two annexations. The only city to gain more residents in that time was Atlanta, and only two Georgia cities — Morgan and Pendergrass — grew at faster rates in the 2010s. City leaders have credited Chamblee&#x27;s location as a transportation hub, with close proximity to two interstates, a MARTA station and the DeKalb–Peachtree Airport, as a key reason for the city&#x27;s growth. In the early 2020s Chamblee attracted multiple mixed-use developments and office projects.

==Geography==
Chamblee is south of Dunwoody, southwest of Doraville, northeast of Brookhaven, and north of Interstate 85. The city is located at (33.887552, -84.305326). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

=== Neighborhoods ===

*Downtown: Downtown Chamblee has been preserved has an early 20th-century railroad community. Many of the buildings are of historic vintage, and the district has architectural similarities to other similar former railroad communities, such as Decatur and Norcross. Much of the downtown businesses are devoted to Chamblee&#x27;s antique industry, but that has been changing. The district has attracted significant commercial development since 2000, including lofts and townhomes. The Chamblee MARTA Station and City Hall are both located downtown. Massive economic development including the Town Center Initiative and downtown revitalization projects, have turned Downtown Chamblee into a mecca for foodies. A recently opened brewery and distillery flank downtown Chamblee. A new Chamblee signature event called, Taste of Chamblee, debuted in the mid 20 Teens, showcases the food of the Chamblee area.
*Buford Highway Corridor: The Buford Highway community is home to one of the highest concentration of foreign-born residents in the country, including Mexican, Central American, Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese. The area attracted many Latino workers during the construction boom that preceded the 1996 Olympic Games. Asian business owners were attracted to the stretch of highway by cheap leases and reliable traffic flow. The more than 1,000 immigrant-owned businesses are owned by and patronized by a wide variety of ethnic groups, including Korean, Mexican, Chinese, and Vietnamese, and Indian, Bangladeshi, Central American, Somali, and Ethiopian. The DeKalb County Chamber of Commerce calls the area the &quot;International Corridor.&quot;
*DeKalb–Peachtree Airport: DeKalb–Peachtree Airport is the third-largest payer of property taxes in DeKalb County, responsible for an estimated 7,300 jobs, and generates approximately $130 million in income for local residents. PDK, as the airport is commonly called (each public-use airport has an official Department of Transportation code of letters and/or numbers), has averaged 230,000 operations-takeoffs and landings-annually for more than thirty years. PDK is the second-busiest airport in Georgia, behind only Hartsfield-Jackson. A multitude of private and public airlines/pilots fly out of PDK every day. PDK&#x27;s economic development, the Globe, is home to small businesses invested in the airline trade.

According to Biz Journal, the Atlanta metropolitan area is home to an &quot;... estimated 50,000 Chinese-Americans...&quot; This suburb of Atlanta, Georgia is home to a Chinatown () that was built in 1988, and is one of the first of the &quot;New Chinatowns&quot; according to the World Journal. Although the city of Atlanta itself does not have a &quot;Chinatown&quot;, Chamblee&#x27;s Chinatown mall is referred to as &quot;Atlanta Chinatown.&quot; The neighborhood is part of the Buford Highway international market area and is located near the Chamblee MARTA station and New Peachtree Road. According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC), refers to this &quot;Chinatown Mall&quot; as &quot;... Atlanta&#x27;s place for Chinese culture.&quot; According to the official website, &quot;Atlanta Chinatown&quot; is located at 5379 New Peachtree Road. According to the Huffington Post, this Chinatown is an example of a &quot;modern Chinatown&quot;, with Albany, Las Vegas, Dallas-Richardson, and North Miami Beach, Florida referenced as similar examples, with regard to the quality of Chinese food. There is an annual Chinese New Year event that is held to celebrate the festival. The author further states that Atlanta&#x27;s Chinatown is &quot;... unlike many older cities&quot; which exists in an urban setting. Atlanta&#x27;s Chinatown according to her is &quot;... in a strip mall&quot; setting. Bonnie Tsui further states in her book that the new Chinatowns rely on the Chinatown being built before the Chinese population comes, as she quoted about Las Vegas&#x27; Chinatown.

The Atlanta Chinatown market opened on August 8, 1988, and was further expanded in 1996 with an influx of new immigrants from Beijing. 
 According to the previous source, Atlanta&#x27;s Chinatown has bakeries, restaurants, cosmetics, bookstores, a newspaper office, and many other Chinese-oriented stores.

According to Biz Journal, Atlanta Chinatown was completely redone in the year 2000 by developer Peter Chang, who purchased the old &quot;Chinatown Square Mall&quot;. The plans call for &quot;...the 65,000-square-foot mall [to include] a Chinese food court which contains 7 vendors, two dine-in restaurants, several offices, a supermarket, gift shops, a bookstore, jewelers, a video rental store, a beauty salon and other retailers. It will be part of the International Village project, a 375-acre live and work community with a global theme that is being developed by local business leaders, the DeKalb Chamber of Commerce, DeKalb County and the city of Chamblee.&quot; According to this article, the plans are to make Atlanta Chinatown a tourist destination rather than it just being another shopping mall.

The area generally spans along and on either side of a stretch of Georgia State Route 13 (SR 13) in DeKalb County. It begins just north of Midtown Atlanta, continues northeast through the towns of Brookhaven, Chamblee, Doraville, and Norcross. Most properties along the corridor are in the form of strip malls, retail businesses surrounded by large parking lots, and large apartment complexes.

The Chamblee Rail Trail is situated in Chamblee. It offers a short but useful paved pathway through downtown, passing under busy Peachtree Boulevard.

At its northern end, sits the city&#x27;s largest park, Keswick Park, and just two blocks from the trail&#x27;s southern end is the Chamblee MARTA Station off Peachtree Road. Natural landscaping and trees keep the route pleasant, while many businesses and restaurants are just steps away.

Work is underway to extend the trail along the former Roswell Railroad spur, bringing the pathway east to Pierce Drive, with long-term plans in the works to link the pathway into the rapidly-developing regional trail network and the Atlanta Beltline. Currently, there are plans for the construction of a multi-use trail, known as the Peachtree Creek Greenway. The goal of the greenway is to provide residents with close-to-home and close-to-work access to bicycle and pedestrian trails, serve transportation and recreation needs, and help encourage quality of life and sustainable economic growth. The trail will connect the cities of Atlanta, Brookhaven, Chamblee and Doraville.

<doc id="110035" wikidata="Q2638470" url="?curid=110035" title="Clarkston, Georgia">
<text>Clarkston is a city in DeKalb County, Georgia, United States. The population was 14,756 as of the 2020 census, up from 7,554 in 2010. 

The city is noted for its ethnic diversity, and is often referred to as &quot;the most diverse square mile in America&quot; and &quot;the Ellis Island of the South.&quot; In the 1990s, refugee resettlement programs identified Clarkston as a good fit for displaced persons of many backgrounds. The rental market was open, residents were moving farther out from the Atlanta urban core, and Clarkston was the last stop on a transit line into the city. At present students attending Clarkston High School come from over 50 countries; the local mosque (Masjid al-Momineen, or Mosque of the Faithful in English) has a diverse and sizable congregation; and over half the population is estimated by some to be foreign born.

==History==
A post office called Clarkston has been in operation since 1876. The Georgia General Assembly incorporated the place in 1882 as the &quot;Town of Clarkston&quot;, with municipal corporate limits extending in a one-half mile radius from the Georgia Railroad depot. The community was named after W. W. Clark, a railroad official.

== Geography ==

Georgia is among states that receive the highest amount of refugees for resettlement, and has resettled more than 37,000 refugees since 1993. Clarkston receives a large portion of these refugees, but arrivals have gradually declined yearly since 2016. In 2016, then Georgia Governor Nathan Deal issued and then reneged on an executive order attempting to cease influx of Syrian refugees into the state. Additionally, as of 2019 federal funding for refugee programs has decreased and executive orders have been issued that allow states increased authority to limit resettlement, which has resulted in the downsizing of several Georgia resettlement organizations.

<text>Decatur () is a city and the county seat of DeKalb County, Georgia, United States, part of the Atlanta metropolitan area. With a population of 24,928 in the 2020 census, the municipality is sometimes assumed to be larger since multiple ZIP Codes in unincorporated DeKalb County bear Decatur as the address.

The city is served by three MARTA rail stations (Decatur, East Lake, and Avondale). The city is located approximately northeast of Downtown Atlanta and shares its western border with both the city of Atlanta (the Kirkwood and Lake Claire neighborhoods) and unincorporated DeKalb County. The Druid Hills neighborhood is to the northwest of Decatur.

Prior to European settlement, the Decatur area was largely forested (a remnant of old-growth forest near Decatur is preserved as Fernbank Forest). Decatur was established at the intersection of two Native American trails: the Sandtown, which led east from the Chattahoochee River at Utoy Creek, and the Shallowford, which follows today&#x27;s Clairmont Road, and eventually crossed near Roswell. A site for the DeKalb County courthouse was designated in 1822 in what would become downtown Decatur; the city of Decatur was incorporated on December 10, 1823. It was named for United States Navy Commodore Stephen Decatur.

The first settler in the area were farmers or skilled tradesmen of English, Scottish and Irish descent.

===American Civil War===
During the American Civil War, Decatur became a strategic site in Sherman&#x27;s Atlanta Campaign. In July 1864, Major-General James McPherson occupied the town to cut off the Confederates&#x27; supply line from Augusta. On July 22, during the Battle of Atlanta, Confederate cavalry under Major-General Joseph Wheeler attacked McPherson&#x27;s supply wagons and the Union troops left to defend the wagons. A historical marker at the old courthouse marks the site of this skirmish.

===20th century===
In the second half of the twentieth century the metropolitan area of Atlanta expanded into unincorporated DeKalb County, eventually surrounding two sides of the town of Decatur. Concurrently, the area experienced white flight, as many residents fled to more distant suburbs. The 1960s and 1970s witnessed dramatic drops in property values. However, more recently the city has regained economic vigor, partially thanks to several long-term downtown development plans that have come to fruition, making Decatur a trendy small mixed-use district with easy transit to downtown Atlanta. Over the past twenty years, it has gained a local and national reputation as a progressive city with a high level of citizen involvement.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Decatur is bordered by Avondale Estates to the southeast and Atlanta to the southwest, and unincorporated DeKalb County elsewhere.

The Eastern Continental Divide bisects the city along the CSX (formerly Georgia Railroad) trackage right of way.

<text>Doraville is a city in DeKalb County, Georgia, United States northeast of Atlanta. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 10,623.

==History==
Doraville was incorporated by an act of the Georgia General Assembly, approved December 15, 1871. From its development until the 1940s, Doraville was a small agricultural community that served the interests of a larger surrounding farming area.

At the end of World War II, Doraville was on a main railroad line and had a new water system. General Motors selected Doraville for a new assembly plant. Doraville grew in the late 1940s and the 1950s as a result. In the late 1940s, plans for Guilford Village, the first subdivision, were announced by Southern Builders and Engineering Company. The 112-home subdivision at Tilly Mill and Flowers Roads was to cover some 58 acres. In 1950, Doraville&#x27;s population was 472. By 1964, its population was 6,160 and its land area was 1,722 acres. Part of the population growth during that period was because of the annexation of Northwoods in 1949 and Oakcliff in 1958.

By the 1980s, Doraville and neighboring Chamblee attracted immigrants relocating to the Atlanta area who settled along Buford Highway. The result is one of the largest Asian communities in the country. Many Latin American countries are also represented. 56% of residents speak a language other than English as a first language. The Doraville MARTA Station was built in 1992, destroying the few buildings that remained of Doraville&#x27;s downtown. The GM Doraville Assembly Plant closed in 2009 and was demolished in 2015.

==Geography==
Doraville is located at (33.905302, -84.273870). Doraville is northeast of Chamblee, southeast of Dunwoody, southwest of Norcross and Peachtree Corners, and northwest of Tucker.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 0.11%, is water. Crooked Creek, a tributary of the Chattahoochee River, runs through Doraville.

The City of Doraville is located in DeKalb County. It has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) and average monthly high temperatures range from 53 °F in January to 90 °F in July.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 10,623 people, 3,231 households, and 2,026 families residing in the city.

==Economy==

Since the closure of the GM Assembly Plant, Doraville&#x27;s economy has carried on with a mix of small, medium businesses. Many small ethnic restaurants can be found along Buford Highway and Peachtree Industrial Blvd. Doraville is the corporate home of Serta Simmons Bedding.

==Government==
Doraville has a council–manager government, consisting of a city manager, city council, and mayor. The city is organized into three districts, with each district electing two city council members. Doraville also has a municipal court with authority over moving violations and local ordinances.

The current city manager is Chris Eldridge and the current mayor is Joseph Geierman. Geierman began his term in 2020 after serving on the Doraville City Council. Geierman is the first openly LGBT Mayor of Doraville and the fourth openly LGBT mayor in Georgia.

==Architecture==
Doraville has three distinct neighborhoods that all have a variety of post World War 2 styles. Northwoods has bungalow, mid-century, and split-level styles. Oakcliff has primarily 1960&#x27;s ranch-style and split-level architecture. The oldest neighborhood is Tilly Mill where bungalow and ranch styles are prevalent. Modern infill homes have been built in Northwoods and Tilly Mill neighborhoods.

<doc id="110038" wikidata="Q2939694" url="?curid=110038" title="Druid Hills, Georgia">
<text>Druid Hills is a community which includes both a census-designated place (CDP) in unincorporated DeKalb County, Georgia, United States, as well as a neighborhood of the city of Atlanta. The CDP&#x27;s population was 14,568 at the 2010 census. The CDP formerly contained the main campus of Emory University and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); however, they were annexed by Atlanta in 2018. The Atlanta-city section of Druid Hills is one of Atlanta&#x27;s most affluent neighborhoods with a mean household income in excess of $238,500 (making it the ninth most affluent, per that metric).

==History==
The planned community was initially conceived by Joel Hurt, and developed with the effort of Atlanta&#x27;s leading families, including Coca-Cola founder Asa Candler. It contains some of Atlanta&#x27;s historic mansions from the late 19th and early 20th century. Druid Hills includes the main campus of Emory University, which relocated to Atlanta in 1914.

Druid Hills was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and was one of his last commissions. A showpiece of the design was the string of parks along Ponce de Leon Avenue, which was designated as Druid Hills Parks and Parkways and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 11, 1975. The remainder of the development was listed on the Register as the Druid Hills Historic District on October 25, 1979. Later the Park and Parkways district was consolidated into the Druid Hills Historic District. The other historic districts in Druid Hills are:

* Emory University District, added in 1975
* University Park-Emory Highlands-Emory Estates Historic District, added in 1998
* Emory Grove Historic District, added in 2000.

By 2015 there was a bill in the Georgia Legislature which called for annexing more of Druid Hills into Atlanta.

In 2016 Emory University&#x27;s administration stated that it intended to petition the university to be annexed into the City of Atlanta, along with the CDC area; in 2017 the university leadership formally submitted its petition. The City of Atlanta annexed Emory&#x27;s campus effective January 1, 2018, a part of its largest annexation within a period of 65 years; the Atlanta City Council voted to do so the prior December.

==Geography==
Druid Hills is located at (33.787205, -84.325974).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.48%, is water. The CDP&#x27;s northern boundary is the South Fork of Peachtree Creek; the CSX track and the Decatur city limits are the eastern boundary; the DeKalb County line is the western boundary; and the southern boundary is the Atlanta city limit.

The Druid Hills neighborhood of Atlanta is bounded by the Druid Hills CDP (i.e. unincorporated DeKalb County) on the north and east; the Morningside/Lenox Park, Virginia-Highland and Poncey-Highland neighborhoods of Atlanta on the west; and the Candler Park neighborhood of Atlanta on the south.

The Chelsea Heights neighborhood is located in the eastern part of the CDP at the Decatur border, and participates in the Druid Hills Civic Association.

==Demographics==


Druid Hills was first listed as a census designated place in the 1980 U.S. census. As of the 2020 United States census, there were 9,429 people, 3,579 households, and 1,977 families residing in the CDP.

==Economy==
Emory University, including its hospitals, is the third largest employer in Metro Atlanta as of 2007/8. The CDC is also an employer of note.

Commercial areas include Emory Village, a small node first developed in the 1920s at the terminus of the streetcar line to Emory. A revitalization of the area was completed in 2011 with new sidewalks, street furniture and two new roundabouts.

The other, larger commercial areas fall just outside the community&#x27;s boundaries, such as the Clairmont Road corridor in North Decatur, the Sage Hill shopping center in Atlanta&#x27;s Morningside/Lenox Park, and the Ponce de Leon Avenue corridor just west of Druid Hills in Atlanta&#x27;s Poncey-Highland/Virginia-Highland.

==Arts and culture==

Druid Hills is home to The Atlanta Boy Choir on S. Ponce de Leon Ave. and Callanwolde Fine Arts Center, housed in the Gothic-Tudor style former estate of Charles Howard Candler, president of Coca-Cola and eldest son of Asa Griggs Candler, Coca-Cola&#x27;s co-founder.

==Parks==
* Baker Woodland, Emory University, between Fishburne Dr. &amp; South Kilga Cir. Forest of oak, tulip poplar, beech, and hickory trees - contains over 100 plant species.
* Burbanck Park, Oxford Rd. &amp; Clifton Rd. natural park which borders Peavine Creek. It is named after Madeline and William Burbanck, Emory University professors who owned the property.
* Fernbank Forest, Fernbank Museum of Natural History.
* Fernbank School Park, 157 Heaton Park Dr. This DeKalb County park is located west of the CSX railroad tracks. It includes a multi-use field and court, playground, picnic area and walking trails.
* Hahn Woods, Emory University, Houston Mill Rd. (&quot;at South Peachtree Creek&quot;). Nature preserve with trail and viewing platform over the creek.
* Medlock Park North Druid Hills subdivision, Nine little league baseball fields with concessions, playground and a running/cycling trail which follows Nancy Creek.
* Olmsted Linear Park, Druid Hills, Ponce de Leon Ave. of six distinct parks, strung along Ponce de Leon Avenue like a necklace. They were designed by Frederick Law Olmsted in the late 19th century. Each of the six parks has its own name: Deepdene, Dellwood, Shadyside, Springdale, Virgilee and Oak Grove (formerly Brightwood).
* Wesley Woods Forest, Emory University.
* Princeton Way Park, a small neighborhood park that is surrounded by the interior homes of Princeton Way. The park is equipped with picnic tables, swings, slides, a sandbox, short walking trails, and an informal baseball setup.

== Government ==

The neighborhood organization, the Druid Hills Civic Association (DHCA), gives input to two authorities since the community is divided between the city of Atlanta and unincorporated territory in DeKalb County.

The Atlanta part is an official recognized neighborhood of Atlanta, which in turn is part of NPU N. Officially, DHCA exercises its input into planning and other city processes by giving input to the NPU.

DeKalb County does not have an officially designated role for the community within the county government in the way the City of Atlanta does (though there are five large geographic districts for the election of county commissioners), so the DHCA gives input to the unitarian county government in Decatur.

The United States Postal Service operates the Druid Hills Post Office at 1799 Briarcliff Road NE in the North Druid Hills CDP in unincorporated DeKalb.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#x27;s main offices were formerly located in the CDP. The City of Atlanta annexed the CDC effective January 1, 2018.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary schools===

The non-Atlanta portions of Druid Hills are in the DeKalb County School District. Most residents are zoned to Fernbank Elementary School (in the Druid Hills CDP) while some are zoned to Briar Vista Elementary School. All residents are zoned to Druid Hills Middle School (in the North Decatur CDP), and Druid Hills High School (in the Druid Hills CDP).
The Atlanta sections (the Emory/CDC annexation) are in Atlanta Public Schools. The zoned schools are Springdale Park Elementary School, D. T. Howard Middle School, and Midtown High School (formerly Henry W. Grady High School). The Emory/CDC annexation was scheduled to be moved into APS from DeKalb Schools in 2024.

The Paideia School is a nearby preK–12 private school in the city of Atlanta.

===Colleges and universities===
Emory University is a private university formerly located in the Druid Hills CDP. The City of Atlanta annexed Emory effective January 1, 2018.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Public bus transportation is provided by the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, while Emory University runs an extensive fleet of shuttles, called the &quot;Cliff&quot;.

===Healthcare===
Emory University Hospital and Children&#x27;s Healthcare of Atlanta - Egleston Hospital are in the Druid Hills area.

The City of Atlanta annexed Egleston and Emory University effective January 1, 2018. Prior to the annexation, Egleston was in Druid Hills CDP, as was Emory Hospital.

<text>Dunwoody is a city located in DeKalb County, Georgia, United States. As a northern suburb of Atlanta, Dunwoody is part of the Atlanta metropolitan area. It was incorporated as a city on December 1, 2008 but its area establishment dates back to the early 1830s. As of 2020, the city had a population of 51,683.

==History==

The Dunwoody area was established in the early 1830s and is named for Major Charles Dunwody (1828–1905), an extra &quot;o&quot; added with the incorrect spelling of the name on a banking note. Charles Dunwody originally returned to Roswell after fighting in the Civil War, in which he fought for the Confederates.

One of Dunwoody&#x27;s most historic buildings dates from 1829. The Ebenezer Primitive Baptist Church, at the corner of Roberts Drive and Spalding Drive, is still active to this date and is also the home to one of the city&#x27;s oldest cemeteries, where many of the founding fathers of Dunwoody are buried. The first public school, Dunwoody Elementary, first stood near the center of the city at the intersection of Chamblee-Dunwoody Road and Mount Vernon Road. It was in continuous operation from 1911 to 1986. A fire destroyed the school&#x27;s cafeteria in 1966, which was on the corner of Womack Road and Chamblee-Dunwoody Road. On that site today, the Dunwoody branch of the Dekalb County Public Library now operates along with the North Dekalb Cultural Arts Center. In 1881, the Roswell Railroad opened and ran along what is now Chamblee-Dunwoody Road north to the Chattahoochee River. It operated for 40 years, and in 1905, President Theodore Roosevelt made a campaign whistle stop in Dunwoody along the way to Roswell, Georgia.

On account of the railroad, Dunwoody developed into a small crossroads community. The community continued to grow and prosper even after the railroad shut down in 1921. Dunwoody remained rural until suburban residential development was initiated in the 1960s. In 1971, the Spruill family sold a large portion of their property for the construction of Perimeter Mall, with the completion of Dunwoody Village occurring the same year.

In early 2006, a study was conducted by the Carl Vinson Institute of Government of the University of Georgia, to determine how feasible it would be to incorporate Dunwoody as a city. Critics claimed that incorporation of Dunwoody, as in the incorporation of Sandy Springs in 2005, would take away a great deal of tax revenue from the rest of the county, leading to shortages of services, tax increases, or both for everyone else in the county, as has happened in Fulton. Citizens for Dunwoody, Inc. was the non-profit advocacy group begun by Senator Dan Weber to promote the effort.

The bill for incorporation was withdrawn from the Georgia General Assembly for further study in 2006 and passed only the lower house in 2007. In 2008, the bill of incorporation was re-introduced by Senator Weber, and due to increased pressure, it passed in the senate as well as the house. Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue signed the bill allowing the residents to vote for a city of Dunwoody on March 25. The referendum for cityhood, which took place on July 15, was approved by an overwhelming majority of voters. The Dunwoody City Charter was later ratified by the Georgia General Assembly, and on December 1, 2008, after a three-year movement, Dunwoody officially became a city.

==Geography==
Dunwoody&#x27;s geographic center is at (33.942751, -84.317694). According to the United States Census Bureau, Dunwoody has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.72%, is water. Dunwoody lies at the northern tip of DeKalb County, bounded by the Fulton County line on the north and west, Interstate 285 on the south, Peachtree Industrial Boulevard on the southeast, and the Gwinnett County line on the northeast. 

Late on April 8, 1998, a major tornado tore through parts of Dunwoody, running east-northeast from Perimeter Center and into Gwinnett County. Thousands of homes were damaged, hundreds seriously, and several dozen were condemned. In addition, tens of thousands of native forest trees were downed. The vast majority of the tornado&#x27;s damage occurred here, leading it to be called the &quot;Dunwoody tornado&quot;, the most vivid in local memory until the 2008 Atlanta tornado.

===Districts and neighborhoods===
Dunwoody Village is the historic heart of the community, and the location of the iconic Dunwoody Farmhouse. The distinctive Colonial Williamsburg architectural style of the district originated with the construction of Dunwoody Village Shopping Center in the 1970s, for which the district gets its name. Since then, all other construction in the area followed suit, giving Dunwoody a unique architectural identity and sense of place.
Perimeter Center is the major edge city and neighborhood that has formed around Perimeter Mall. The mall was developed in 1971, spurring major office, residential, and commercial developments in the decades since. It is one of Metro Atlanta&#x27;s largest job centers, employing hundreds of thousands of people each day. Perimeter Mall and approximately 40 percent of the Perimeter Community Improvement District, is a self-taxing district of shopping and office buildings (including several high-rises), are both located in Dunwoody. The western part of Perimeter Center edge city spans the Fulton county line into Sandy Springs. The tallest building in Dunwoody is the 34-story Ravinia 3, at . Perimeter Center is located at the intersection of two major highways, GA 400 and I-285. The Dunwoody Transit Station provides public transit to the district.

Georgetown was developed in the early 1960s. It is located near I-285 and borders with the city limits of Chamblee. Overdevelopment in Georgetown was one of the main reasons for the initiation of Dunwoody&#x27;s incorporation movement, with many new apartments being approved for the area, even in some single-family residential areas. Georgetown, one of the most walkable areas of the city, contains both single-family residential subdivisions and its own retail district. This includes Kroger, who also owns and manages the property.

The Williamsburg commercial district is located on the eastern edge of Dunwoody, adjacent to the Dunwoody Panhandle of Sandy Springs. Shopping areas include Orchard Park Shopping Center, Mt. Vernon Shopping Center and the Williamsburg at Dunwoody Shopping Center. The centralized dining and shopping covers the intersection of Mt. Vernon, Dunwoody Club Drive, and Jett Ferry Road.

Winters Chapel is located at Dunwoody&#x27;s border with Peachtree Corners. The district shares a name with its main road, which travels through Fulton, Gwinnett and DeKalb County and was an important 19th century route connecting Decatur and Roswell via Holcomb Bridge Road. The district is named after Winters Chapel (now Winters Chapel Methodist Church), which has resided at its present location since the 1870s. The church itself is named after an instrumental founder, Jeremiah Winters. The area is a prime location for light commercial and retail redevelopment opportunities due to good demographics and traffic counts. Two parks, connected by sidewalks, dominate Winters Chapel. The 3/4 mile long, meticulously groomed, linear park running along DeKalb County&#x27;s Twin Lakes water reservoir on Peeler Road is popular with walkers and joggers. Windwood Hollow Park, at Lakeside Drive and Peeler Road, offers tennis, a children&#x27;s play area, a picnic pavilion, and a short trail.

Tilly Mill is named after the pioneer Tilly family, who owned a late 19th-century farm and mill on land bisected by Tilly Mill Road, which connects Dunwoody to Peachtree Industrial and Doraville. Landmarks in the area include the Dunwoody campus of Georgia State University&#x27;s Perimeter College and Dunwoody&#x27;s signature park, Brook Run. Brook Run, on North Peachtree Road near its intersection with Tilly Mill Road, boasts many wooded walking trails, a children&#x27;s play area, a dog park, a Veterans Memorial, and a community garden. The site will see major improvements as Dunwoody plans for its future. Also in Tilly Mill is the Marcus Jewish Community Center, an Orthodox synagogue, and a significant portion of Dunwoody&#x27;s Jewish population.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 51,683 people, 20,482 households, and 12,620 families residing in the city.

==Government==

The city has a council-manager form of municipal government. Its first mayor was Ken Wright. The current mayor is Lynn Deutsch, elected in November 2019. The city manager is Eric Linton.

Dunwoody&#x27;s city hall is located at 4800 Ashford-Dunwoody Road from early 2018, after the property was purchased by the city in 2017. The city was renting a space in a Perimeter Center office building at 41 Perimeter Center East for several years prior. City Hall was originally at a temporary location in the city of Sandy Springs for most of the city&#x27;s first year.

Dunwoody operates its own police force of 64 officers, as well as departments over zoning and land use. The city receives services from DeKalb County including: DeKalb County Schools, Dekalb County Fire &amp; Rescue, sanitation, water, and sewage.

==Economy==

The &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; has its headquarters in the Perimeter Center and in Dunwoody. In 2010 the newspaper relocated its headquarters from Downtown Atlanta to leased offices in the Perimeter Center for financial reasons. There are a number of other local media organizations serving the Dunwoody area which primarily provide local news: the Dunwoody Crier, Dunwoody Reporter, the Aha Connection, and a podcast What&#x27;s Up Dunwoody.

<text>North Decatur is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in DeKalb County, Georgia, United States. The population was 18,511 in 2020.

==History==
An early settler in this part of DeKalb County was Chapman Powell, whose &quot;Medicine House&quot; cabin was built near 1218 Clairmont Road. (It has been preserved and relocated to Stone Mountain Park.) Dr. Powell (1798-1870) owned most of the land in the Candler Lake and South Fork Peachtree Creek area during his lifetime. His land was later purchased by Walter Candler.

Ezekiel Mason built a mill on the east side of Clairmont Road on Burnt Fork Creek. DeKalb County&#x27;s Mason Mill Park, as well as local eatery Mason Tavern, are named after Ezekiel Mason.
==Geography==
North Decatur is located at (33.803054, -84.290123).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 5.0 square miles (12.9 km), all land. The North Decatur CDP&#x27;s boundaries are:
* South: the city of Decatur
* West: CSX railroad and Clairmont Road, across which are the North Druid Hills and Druid Hills CDPs
* North: LaVista Road and Pangborn Road, across which are neighborhoods mostly inside the Tucker CCD
* East: Lawrenceville Highway and DeKalb Industrial Way, across which is mostly the Scottdale CDP

There is no true center to North Decatur; there are three commercial clusters at corners of the CDP:

* The student-oriented commercial district at Clairmont Road and North Decatur Road at the southwest corner of the CDP
* the Toco Hills retail cluster at North Druid Hills Road and Lavista Road at the northwest corner, and 
* North DeKalb Mall and adjacent shopping centers along Lawrenceville Highway at the northeast corner of the district

Toco Hills, a de facto commercial center for several CDPs north of the city of Decatur, has grown from a country store in 1950, with a single gas pump and a pot-bellied stove, to multiple shopping centers, coffee houses, houses of worship and townhouses.

North Decatur primarily consists of 1950s and 1960s-era ranch homes, although condominiums are increasingly being developed in this community. Its proximity to Atlanta&#x27;s Midtown and Buckhead districts, as well as Emory University and Decatur, makes it a desirable &quot;in-town&quot; location for what was originally developed as a suburban community.

<text>North Druid Hills, also known as Briarcliff or Toco Hills, is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (North Druid Hills CDP) in DeKalb County, Georgia, United States. The population was 20,385 in 2020. The commercial center of the area is the Toco Hill Shopping Center, located near the intersection of North Druid Hills Road and LaVista Road.

==History==
One of the earliest European settlers in north DeKalb County was Chapman Powell, whose &quot;Medicine House&quot; cabin was built near the intersection of Clairmont and North Decatur roads (later relocated to Stone Mountain Park, where it still stands). Dr. Powell (1798–1870) owned most of the land in the Candler Lake and South Fork Peachtree Creek area during his lifetime. His land was later purchased by Walter Candler.

Major Washington Jackson Houston owned land on the north side of the South Fork of Peachtree Creek, in what is now Briarcliff. Visitors used to visit Major Houston to buy ground cornmeal produced by his 1876 gristmill or to attend social gatherings held on his property. Major Houston converted the mill into an early hydroelectric plant circa 1900. Atlanta contractor Harry J. Carr bought Houston&#x27;s land in the 1920s and constructed the fieldstone and wrought iron home now known as the Houston Mill House. Emory University purchased the home in the 1960s and renovated it. Houston Mill House, located at 849 Houston Mill Road, is now open for dining and special events.

After World War II and continuing into the 1950s, many Jews moved out of Washington-Rawson, where Turner Field now stands, and the Old Fourth Ward into North Druid Hills and Morningside/Lenox Park. Congregation Beth Jacob, an orthodox synagogue, moved to LaVista Road in 1962, and the neighborhood has since become a hub of Orthodox Judaism for the Atlanta area with three Jewish schools, six congregations and a mikveh located along or near LaVista Road.

The North Druid Hills CDP remained rural until 1965, when Executive Park was constructed on a former dairy farm as the first suburban office park in metropolitan Atlanta. Following the completion of Executive Park, the area boomed with suburban development. The 19-story Executive Park Motor Hotel, built in the 1970s at the southeast corner of I-85 and North Druid Hills Road and which later served as a BellSouth training center, was a modernist landmark until its demolition in November 2014 after being purchased by Children&#x27;s Healthcare of Atlanta for $9.6 million in January 2013.

=== Incorporation movement ===
Following the incorporation of Brookhaven in 2012, the idea of incorporating a city of Briarcliff was proposed by a civic group known as the North Druid Hills Study Group. Supporters cited more local control as reasons in favor of cityhood, while those against cityhood cited the lack of an identity, center, and boundaries as reasons against. The city of Briarcliff boundaries would be:
* I-85 on the north
* I-285 on the east,
* on the south, the cities of Decatur and Avondale Estates; unincorporated DeKalb county, as well as the Druid Hills neighborhood of the City of Atlanta, keeping in mind that unincorporated Druid Hills and the Emory University area would be part of Briarcliff
* City of Atlanta (Virginia-Highland, Morningside-Lenox Park and Lindridge-Martin Manor neighborhoods) on the west.

In March 2014 after failure of the first initiative the City of Briarcliff Initiative, Inc. announced plans for a second attempt at cityhood, which it dubbed &quot;Briarcliff 2.0&quot;.

====Toco Hills====
Toco Hills is a large commercial and residential neighborhood in the eastern portion of the North Druid Hills CDP. The commercial component consists of two major shopping centers that are located at the intersection of LaVista and North Druid Hills roads that were developed in the 1950s. While it is generally accepted that the name &quot;Toco Hills&quot; is derived from the Toco Hill shopping center, the origin of that name is disputed. Some sources claim that the developer chose the name Toco because it was the Brazilian Indian word for &quot;good luck.&quot; Other sources claim Toco is an informal abbreviation of &quot;top of the County.&quot; In any case, the shopping center was developed on what was a hill, and the name gradually changed to &quot;Toco Hills.&quot; The area is home to a large Orthodox Jewish population, and marked by wooded subdivisions featuring mostly ranch homes surrounding the commercial area.

<text>Pine Lake is the smallest city in DeKalb County, Georgia, United States. The population was 752 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Pine Lake was established as a city in December 1937, after a short life as a summer retreat run by the Pine Woods Corporation. The corporation sold lots around a small fishing lake to Atlantans who lived in (then) faraway areas like Buckhead for use as a weekend retreat. The 20&#x27; x 100&#x27; lots sold for $69, and the advertisement for lots directed people &quot;from Decatur down the [unpaved] Rockbridge Road East.&quot; Many homeowners continued to use their property as a weekend getaway long after the city incorporated. Prior to development, Pine Lake was a portion of a farm. The lake was formerly a widened region of Snapfinger Creek, and the valley that encompasses much of the town was where corn was grown. The lake was dammed by the Army Corps of Engineers as erosion and flood control, prior to the official FDR lake projects.

==Geography==
Pine Lake is located at (33.791505, -84.206428). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and 5.00% is water.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 752 people, 386 households, and 199 families residing in the city.

==Education==
Residents are zoned to schools in the DeKalb County School District.
* Stone Mountain High School
* Stone Mountain Middle School
* Rockbridge Elementary School

All of the schools are located outside of the Pine Lake city limits in unincorporated sections of DeKalb County.

==In Media==
&quot;Welcome to Pine Lake&quot;, is a documentary feature film released in 2020 by ViacomCBS. The largely observational film looks at the all-women leadership in the predominantly white city of Pine Lake. The documentary claims that the primary funding source of the City’s police force is from traffic tickets issued predominately to people of color from the surrounding communities. According to National Public Radio member station KCRW, the filmmaker “found that this progressive town was participating in an unfair and ultimately racist criminal justice system.” In February, 2022, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote, &quot; &#x27;Welcome to Pine Lake&#x27; is a scathing indictment of the privilege of obliviousness when it comes to class and race.&quot;

<doc id="110049" wikidata="Q2073622" url="?curid=110049" title="Stone Mountain, Georgia">
<text>Stone Mountain is a city in DeKalb County, Georgia, United States. The population was 6,703 according in 2020. Stone Mountain is in the eastern part of DeKalb County and is a suburb of Atlanta that encompasses nearly 1.7 square miles. It lies near and touches the western base of the geological formation of the same name. Locals often call the city &quot;Stone Mountain Village&quot; to distinguish it from the larger unincorporated area traditionally considered Stone Mountain and Stone Mountain Park.

==History==
Stone Mountain&#x27;s history traces back to before the time of European settlement, with local burial mounds dating back hundreds of years built by the ancestors of the historical Muskogee Creek nation who first met the settlers in the early colonial period. 

The Treaty of Indian Springs in 1821 opened a large swath of Georgia for settlement by non-Native Americans on former Creek Indian land, including present-day Stone Mountain Village. In 1822, the area that now makes up the city was made a part of the newly formed DeKalb County.

===Settlement===
By the 1820s, Rock Mountain, as it was then called, was &quot;a major travel center&quot;, with an inn for travelers. A stagecoach line linking the village with Georgia&#x27;s capital, Milledgeville, began in 1825. Another stage line ran to Winder and Athens. In 1828 another stage line began trips to Dahlonega, and a fourth connected the community with Macon. &quot;Hundreds of people visited Rock Mountain in the summer [of 1828] and...a house of entertainment was nearby.&quot; Rail service did not reach the town, by then New Gibraltar, until 1845.

A post office was created in 1834 on the old Augusta Road, and Andrew Johnson, called the founder of New Gibraltar and first mayor, around whose house the city limits were drawn, built a hotel along the road in 1836. (&quot;An 1843 amendment to the act of incorporation extended the town limits to in every direction from the house of Andrew Johnson.&quot;) About 1839 Aaron Cloud, who also had a hotel, built a wooden observation tower, octagonal like a lighthouse and high, along with a restaurant and club, at the mountain&#x27;s summit. A storm destroyed the tower in 1849; in 1851, Thomas Henry built a smaller, tower, with telescopes so it could serve as an observatory. Visitors to the mountain traveled by rail and road, then hiked up the mountaintop trail to the top. By 1850, Stone Mountain had become a popular destination for Atlanta urbanites who endured the four-hour round trip by rail just to experience its natural beauty, lodging, and attractions.

===Industry===
Granite quarrying at the mountain was the area&#x27;s lifeblood for decades, employing many thousands. The excellent grade of building stone from the mountain was used in many notable structures, including the locks of the Panama Canal, the roof of the bullion depository at Fort Knox, Philadelphia&#x27;s Liberty National Building, and the steps in the east wing of the U.S. Capitol.

In August 1846, New Gibraltar hosted Georgia&#x27;s first state fair, then known as the Agriculture Fair and Internal Improvement Jubilee. The fair had just one exhibit—three horses and two cows, both belonging to the event&#x27;s organizer, John Graves. The next year, the village again hosted the event, which featured caskets, marble, embroidery, brooms, bedspreads, vegetables, blooded stock, wheat, farm tools, and a magnetic telegraph. Stone Mountain hosted the event until 1850, when it moved to Macon.
===American Civil War===
Though DeKalb County voted against secession from the United States, it was not spared the devastation of the Civil War. Stone Mountain Village went unscathed until the Battle of Atlanta, when it was destroyed by men under the command of General James B. McPherson on July 19, 1864. Several antebellum homes were spared as they were used as hospitals. The railroad depot&#x27;s roof burned, but the building stood, owing to its 2-foot-thick granite walls.

From the village&#x27;s destruction in July 1864 until November, Union forces scavenged Stone Mountain and the surrounding area, taking corn, wheat, cotton, cattle, and other goods. On November 15, 1864, between 12,000 and 15,000 Union troops marched through Stone Mountain and further destroyed the rail lines. The rails were rendered useless by heating them over burning railroad ties, then twisting them around trees. The term Sherman&#x27;s neckties was coined for this form of destruction.

===Birth of Shermantown===
After the Civil War ended, housing in the area was rebuilt as Stone Mountain granite was again in demand for construction across the nation. A significant portion of the quarry&#x27;s work force were African Americans, but they were generally excluded from areas where white families lived, so a shantytown, Shermantown, came into being at the southeast side of the village; its name was a reference to Union General William T. Sherman.

In 1868, Reverend R. M. Burson organized Bethsaida Baptist Church to serve Shermantown. A church building was then built under Reverend F. M. Simons at what is now 853 Fourth Street. Simons was among a delegation of southern African American pastors to meet with Sherman in Washington, D.C. after the war to discuss the treatment of the freedmen. Bethsaida Baptist is still an active part of the Stone Mountain Village.

By the 20th century, much of Shermantown&#x27;s original structures had been replaced. Bethsaida&#x27;s original wooden structure was replaced by stone in 1920. Though Shermantown has mostly integrated into the growing Stone Mountain Village, it retains its own distinct community.

===Rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan===
The year 1915 was when the Ku Klux Klan, a white supremacist organization, was reborn. Members assembled at Stone Mountain with permission of quarry owner Samuel Venable, an active member. Their activities, including annual cross-burnings, continued for over 40 years, but Stone Mountain&#x27;s association with the Klan began to erode when the State of Georgia began to acquire the mountain and surrounding property in 1958. In 1960, Governor Ernest Vandiver condemned the property the state had purchased in order to void the perpetual easements Venable had granted the Klan. This ended any official link between Stone Mountain and the Klan.

===Civil rights movement===
During the civil rights movement&#x27;s March on Washington, on August 28, 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. referred to Stone Mountain in his iconic &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech when he proclaimed, &quot;let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!&quot; Charles Burris, the Village&#x27;s first African-American mayor, dedicated the Freedom Bell on Main Street in King&#x27;s honor on February 26, 2000. At an annual ceremony held on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the bell is rung to commemorate King&#x27;s legacy.

===Many names===
The mountain has been known by countless names throughout the centuries. It was called Crystal Mountain by 16th-century Spanish explorer Juan Pardo when he visited in 1567. The Creek Indians who inhabited the area at that time used a name translating to &quot;Lone Mountain&quot;. Around the turn of the 19th century, settlers called it Rock Mountain or Rock Fort Mountain. By the end of the 1830s, Stone Mountain had become the generally accepted name. Like the mountain, the village formed at its base was initially known as Rock Mountain but was incorporated as New Gibraltar in 1839 by an act of the General Assembly. In 1847 the Georgia legislature changed the name to Stone Mountain.

===Cemetery===
The Stone Mountain Cemetery, established around 1850, is a microcosm of the village&#x27;s past. It is the final resting place for roughly 200 unknown Confederate soldiers. 71 known Confederate soldiers are buried there, along with James Sprayberry, a Union soldier. Another notable site is the grave of George Pressley Trout, who is buried there with his wife and his horse. James B. Rivers, the village&#x27;s first African American police chief, is at rest there on a hillside facing the mountain. The cemetery is still in use.

===In film===
The Stone Mountain area has been a beneficiary of Georgia&#x27;s flourishing film industry. Film crews and production personnel have become common sights in Stone Mountain Village. Due to the demand for filming in the historic downtown area, requests for filming in the village are handled by the downtown development authority. The proceeds help fund festivals and other public events for the community.

Most of the shops and buildings on Main Street were built right after the turn of the 20th century and maintain many of the original facades. This has provided an appropriate backdrop for a number of filming projects, ranging from period pieces to those requiring a quaint village setting.

Parts of motion pictures like &quot;Footloose&quot; (2011) and &quot;Need for Speed&quot; (2014) were filmed in the village. The growing number of television show credits include &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot;, &quot;Kevin (Probably) Saves the World&quot;, &quot;MacGyver&quot;, and the Netflix science fiction/horror series &quot;Stranger Things&quot;.

<doc id="110050" wikidata="Q2051179" url="?curid=110050" title="Tucker, Georgia">
<text>Tucker is a city located in DeKalb County, Georgia, United States, located near Atlanta and was originally settled in the 1820s, and later developed as a railroad community in 1892. According to the 2016 United States Census Bureau annual estimate of resident population, it has a population of 35,322. In a November 2015 referendum, by a 3:1 margin (73.94%), voters approved incorporating Tucker into a city. In March 2016, Tucker residents elected the city&#x27;s first mayor and city council.

==History==

===Settlers===
The 1821 Georgia Land Lottery opened portions of state land for settlement between the Flint and Ocmulgee rivers, including present-day DeKalb County. The Muscogee (Creek) Nation ceded the land to the United States in January of that year, and drawings for lots measuring each began in May in Milledgeville, the state capital until 1868. The land grant fee was $19.00.

In 1821, the area that would become Tucker was in Militia District 572 in Henry County. The state created DeKalb County on December 9, 1822, and District 572 became DeKalb&#x27;s 18th District, or the Brownings District, reportedly named for Andrew Browning.

Among the thirty cemeteries within a radius of Main Street, approximately 30 graves belong to individuals born in the 18th century, four of whom are Revolutionary War soldiers. Twelve graves belong to Confederate soldiers.

=== American Civil War===
In spite of DeKalb County delegates voting against secession from the United States, Georgia joined the Confederacy and seceded from the Union in 1861. The full reality of that decision marched into Tucker in July 1864. Union soldiers camped at Henderson&#x27;s Mill, used the Brownings Courthouse, one of the few buildings in the area they did not burn, dismantled the railroad to Stone Mountain, and formed the left wing of Sherman&#x27;s advance to Atlanta.
===Railroad===
In 1886 the Georgia, Carolina and Northern Railway received a charter to build a new rail line between Monroe, North Carolina, and Atlanta. Prior to the project&#x27;s completion, the company leased the road to the Seaboard Air Line Railroad system, a collection of regional railroads headquartered in North Carolina eager to extend its reach to Atlanta.

Seaboard built depots at a number of small villages, often little more than a crossroads, and named them for railroad company officials. The depot at Jug Tavern, for example, was named for Seaboard&#x27;s general manager, John H. Winder. The stop at Bryan was named in honor of the system&#x27;s general superintendent, Lilburn Meyers. Although the origin of the name is unknown, it is possible that the next stop, in the Brownings District, may have been named for Rufus S. Tucker, a director and major shareholder in several Seaboard system railroads. At the DeKalb County Centennial Celebration in 1922, Charles Murphey Candler stated that Tucker a “prosperous and promising village on the Seaboard Air Line Railway... was named in honor of Capt. Tucker, an official of the Seaboard Air Railway.” Some residents attribute the name to a local family with the surname Tucker.

The first train steamed into the new Tucker station on Sunday, April 24, 1892. Originating in Elberton with a final destination of the Atlanta suburb of Inman Park — a four-hour trip — the Seaboard train consisted of two cars carrying 150 passengers and a baggage car. Two months later the US Postal Service appointed Alpheus G. Chewning first Postmaster of the Tucker Post office. Rural Free Delivery began on March 2, 1903.

On Saturday, July 1, 1967, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad merged with the Atlantic Coast Line to form Seaboard Coast Line Railroad. In 1983 The line became Seaboard System and merged with the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio, Baltimore &amp; Ohio and the Western Maryland in 1986 Chessie System to form current railroad operator, CSXT.
Although no longer a train stop for passengers, the Tucker depot is currently a CSX field office for track repair and signal maintenance.

Tucker, at above sea level, is the highest point of elevation on the railroad line between Atlanta and Richmond, Virginia.

=== 20th century ===
Following World War II, Tucker began a steady transition from an agricultural community to a mixed industrial, retail, and residential area. The strength of a county-wide water system extending into Tucker by the 1950s, and the post war establishment of nearby employers in other areas of the county including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1946 (originally known as the Communicable Disease Center), General Motors in Doraville, Kraft Foods and a large Veterans&#x27; Hospital in Decatur, and the growth of Emory University, brought new residents to Tucker from across the nation. Descendants of early settlers subdivided and sold family land for neighborhoods and shopping plazas. Local community leaders opened Tucker Federal Savings and Loan, created a youth football league, and by the 1960s newspapers identified Tucker as “DeKalb’s Area of Golden Opportunity.” The post–World War II baby boom drove the growth of DeKalb County schools and with the affordability of the car, the expansion of the highway system, and inexpensive fuel, Tucker became an ideal location to call home.

=== 21st century ===
A Honduran immigrant, who had permission to live and work in the United States while his asylum application proceeded, was arrested in Tucker by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents during Sunday church services. The man was reported to have been worshiping in the church at a church he helped found with his wife and children when he was summoned outside by the agents. The arrest was the first reported ICE raid at a church during the second term of President Donald Trump.

Rocks typical of the region include schist, amphibolite, gneiss, migmatite, and granite.

Over a dozen creeks originate in Tucker including Burnt Fork Creek, South Fork Peachtree Creek, Camp Creek, and Henderson Mill Creek. Prior to the widespread accessibility of electricity and indoor plumbing, several were used as mill ponds or dammed for baptism. From 1906 until its demise in the 1940s, Burnt Fort Creek was the primary tributary for the Decatur Waterworks.

Road improvements, public safety, water, and library resources were pushed to the far ends of the County under his administration. Tucker residents continued the tradition of expansion by maintaining and improving these resources throughout the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. Local businesses like Cofer Brothers, a lumber and supply company, thrived under the mid-century housing boom.

<text>Eastman is a city in Dodge County, Georgia, United States. The population was 5,658 at the 2020 census, up from 4,962 at the 2010 census. The city was named after William Pitt Eastman, a native of Massachusetts who purchased a large tract of land along the Macon and Brunswick Railroad, and settled a city on the site.

In the 19th century, this was a center of the timber and sawmill industry. During the Great Depression in 1937, the first Stuckey&#x27;s Pecan Shoppe, once well-known along roadways throughout the United States, was founded in Eastman.

==History==
The first permanent settlement of the area took place in 1840. The population continued to grow when, in 1869, a station was built for the newly constructed Macon and Brunswick Railroad which passed through the area, stimulating an economic boom. The settlement was originally named Levison and was renamed Eastman by December 1869.
Eastman was designated as the seat of newly formed Dodge County in 1871. It was incorporated as a town in 1873 and as a city in 1905. Eastman is named for W. P. Eastman, who, with W. E. Dodge, presented the county with a courthouse.

During that same time period, Ira Roe Foster, former Quartermaster General of Georgia, operated a sawmill in Dodge County. In 1869, Foster built a residence in what would become Eastman. Foster was one of many who came to the area to participate in the timber and sawmill boom.

During the boom, it was estimated that, on average, there was one mill every two miles along the industrial corridor created by the Macon and Brunswick Railroad. Unlike earlier eras, when timber was transported downstream in large river rafts, sawmills along the industrial corridor shipped their timber by rail. In his book &quot;The New South Comes to Wiregrass Georgia 1860-1910&quot;, author Mark V. Wetherington states: &quot;Ira R. Foster shipped lumber to Brunswick, where it was loaded onto timber schooners and transported to international markets like Liverpool, Rio de Janeiro, and Havana.&quot; When Eastman was incorporated in 1872, Foster served as its first mayor.

In the early years of the 20th century, racial tensions increased between the white and black communities in and about Eastman, resulting in a number of documented lynchings. In one instance, a man misidentified as the rapist Ed Claus was murdered before the real Claus was identified, apprehended, and lynched. In 1919, rumors that local blacks were intending to rise up and exterminate white residents, led to the murder of Eli Cooper and the burning of several black churches, which were believed to be the focal point of the uprising.

==Geography==
Eastman is located in the center of Dodge County at (32.197760, -83.179271). U.S. Route 23 passes through the center of town, leading northwest to Cochran and southeast to McRae-Helena. U.S. Route 341 bypasses the city on the southwest, leading west to Hawkinsville and southeast with US 23 to McRae-Helena. Sugar Creek runs to the southwest of the city.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Eastman has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.93%, is water.

==Demographics==

<text>Albany ( ) is a city in the U.S. state of Georgia. Located on the Flint River, it is the county seat of Dougherty County, and is the sole incorporated city in that county. Located in Southwest Georgia, it is the principal city of the Albany metropolitan area. The city&#x27;s population was 68,089 in 2020.

It became prominent in the nineteenth century as a shipping and market center, first served by riverboats. Scheduled steamboats connected Albany with the busy port of Apalachicola, Florida. They were replaced by railroads. Seven lines met in Albany, and it was a center of trade in the Southeast.

Albany is part of the Black Belt, a geological formation of soil conducive to cotton growth. An extensive area in the Southern geographical area of the United States. From the mid-20th century, it received military investment during World War II and after, that helped develop the region. Albany and this area were prominent during the civil rights era, particularly during the early 1960s as activists worked to regain voting and other civil rights. Railroad restructuring and reduction in the military here caused job losses, but the city has developed new businesses.

==History==
Albany is located in a region which was long inhabited by the Creek Indians, who called it &quot;Thronateeska&quot; after their word for &quot;flint&quot;, the valuable mineral found in beds near the Flint River. They used it for making arrowheads and other tools. In 1830, U.S. Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, and the United States made treaties to extinguish Creek and other Native American land claims in the Southeast. The U.S. Army forcibly removed most of the native peoples to Indian Territory, lands west of the Mississippi River.

===Nelson Tift===
European-American settlement began with Nelson Tift of Groton, Connecticut, who took land along the Flint River in October 1836 after Indian removal. Tift and his colleagues named the new town Albany after the capital of New York; noting that New York&#x27;s Albany was a commercial center located at the headwaters of the Hudson River, they hoped that their town near the headwaters of the Flint would prove to be just as successful. It proved to be nowhere near as prosperous. Alexander Shotwell laid out the town in 1836, and it was incorporated as a city by an act of the General Assembly of Georgia on December 27, 1838.

Tift was the city&#x27;s leading entrepreneur for decades. An ardent booster, he promoted education, business, and railroad construction. During the Civil War he provided naval supplies and helped build two ships. He opposed Radical Reconstruction inside the state and in Congress, and was scornful of the Yankee carpetbaggers who came in. Historian John Fair concludes that Tift became &quot;more Southern than many natives.&quot; His pro-slavery attitudes before the war and his support for segregation afterward made him compatible with Georgia&#x27;s white elite.

This area was developed for cotton cultivation by planters, who used numerous enslaved African Americans to clear lands and process the cotton. As a result of the planters&#x27; acquisition of slave workers, by 1840 Dougherty County&#x27;s majority population was black, composed overwhelmingly of slaves. The market center for cotton plantations, Albany was in a prime location for shipping cotton to other markets by steamboats. In 1858, Tift hired Horace King, a former slave and bridge builder, to construct a toll bridge over the river. King&#x27;s bridge toll house still stands.

Already important as a shipping port, Albany later became an important railroad hub in southwestern Georgia. Seven lines were constructed to the town. An exhibit on trains is located at the Thronateeska Heritage Center in the former railroad station.

===Carey Wentworth Styles===
After the war, Carey Wentworth Styles moved to Albany and founded the newspaper &quot;Albany News&quot;. In the early years following the war, Styles, like Tift, took great exception to the Radical Reconstruction program then in force, and advocated for a more moderate response based on his interpretation of Georgia&#x27;s rights under the Constitution. Styles backed &quot;constitutional reconstruction&quot; advanced by Benjamin H. Hill and sought support for the idea from the national Democratic party. While on a trip to Atlanta in May 1868, to meet with Democratic party leaders, Styles took measure of the contemporary Atlanta newspapers, and found them lacking.

Styles believed them to be little more than organs for the Radical Republican reconstruction agenda. He resolved to bring a paper aligned with the Democratic party viewpoint to the Atlanta market, one supporting his constitutional reconstruction ideals. Styles moved from Albany to Atlanta, and on May 9 he announced that he had obtained the necessary financial backing to purchase the &quot;Daily Opinion&quot;.

On June 16, 1868 the &quot;new Democratic daily&quot; (as he described it) printed its first edition, under the name &quot;The Constitution&quot;. Styles&#x27; tenure at the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot; would be brief. Unable to pay for his portion of the purchase, when the sale of his &quot;Albany News&quot; fell through, Styles was forced to surrender his interest in the paper to his joint venture partners. Styles returned to Albany as editor of the &quot;News&quot;. In 1872, he was elected to the Georgia Senate, representing Augusta and surrounding communities, in an ironic turn of events, having killed a member of the Georgia House of Representatives in his earlier years. After his legislative service, Styles sold the Albany newspaper in 1876 and returned to Atlanta.

===20th century to present===

While integral to the economic life of the town, the Flint River has flooded regularly. It caused extensive property damage in 1841 and 1925. The city has also been subject to tornadoes. On February 10, 1940, a severe tornado hit Albany, killing eighteen people and causing large-scale damage.

====1940 tornado gallery====
On April 11, 1906, the Carnegie Library, created by matching funds from the philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, was opened downtown. Originally a segregated facility under Jim Crow laws, it was not open to African Americans until after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It functioned as a library through 1985. In 1992, after renovation, the building was reopened as the headquarters of the Albany Area Arts Council.

In 1912, the downtown U.S. Post Office and courthouse building opened. Other federal projects have been important to the city and region. In 1937, Chehaw Park was constructed as a part of a New Deal program under the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression.

Major changes came with the expansion of military facilities in the city, secured by the powerful Southern Block in Congress. A U.S. Army Air Corps training base was built near Albany on land owned by the city and leased to the Air Corps for $1 a year. Construction of the base and airfield by the Army Corps of Engineers began on March 25, 1941. After being used during World War II, the airfield was temporarily deactivated between August 15, 1946, and September 1, 1947.

After the beginning of the Cold War and the founding of the U.S. Air Force in late 1947, the airfield was reactivated and upgraded with runways for a U.S. Air Force base. It was named Turner Air Force Base. The Air Force used this base for heavy bomber jets, such as the B-52 Stratofortress. A number of other Air Force units were also housed at this base. Among them were the 1370th Photomapping Group, and refueling and maintenance functions.

In 1951, the U.S. Marine Corps established a logistics base on the eastern outskirts of Albany. During the 1950s and 1960s, so many white servicemen and associated workers arrived that the city briefly became majority white for the first time since 1870.

In 1960, the population of Albany reached 50,000 people. During 1961–1962, African Americans in Albany played a prominent role in the Civil Rights Movement (see the Albany Movement). They led protests and non-violent demonstrations to end segregation of public facilities, gain the right to vote, and advance social justice. Assisted by activists from SCLC, CORE, SNCC, and the NAACP, African Americans and supporters took a stand to fight segregation through nonviolence. The city repealed its Jim Crow laws in 1963, but African Americans did not recover the ability to exercise their voting rights until Congress passed enforcement authority with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

In 1967, the Air Force closed all its operations at the base, which was transferred to the U.S. Navy and renamed Naval Air Station Albany. NAS Albany was used as the shore base of nearly all the Navy&#x27;s RA-5C Vigilante twin-jet, carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft. In 1974, the base was closed and the property was returned to the city.

In 1979, the Miller Brewing Company purchased part of the old naval base&#x27;s property to build a new brewery.

The decline in military bases and railroad restructuring nationwide both led to job losses in the Albany area. Much of the remaining white population moved to suburbs and newer housing out of the city, which became majority African American in the 1970s. Struggling with a poor economy, in 1988 Albany made national headlines as the &quot;Murder Capital of America&quot;, with the highest murder rate per capita in the United States. Other cities have since taken that title.

Some late twentieth-century floods have been extreme. In 1994, a severe flood was caused by rainfall from Tropical Storm Alberto; it killed 14 people and displaced 22,000. The state supported a $150 million renovation of the Albany State University campus to repair storm damage and complete upgrades. New housing was built on the south side of town to replace what had been destroyed. In 1998, the Flint River crested at above its bed and flooded parts of the city.

Because of such flooding, the city has decided against redeveloping areas along the riverfront floodplain for commercial or residential purposes. This area is being improved for other uses, with a riverfront walkway and a new aquarium built over a tributary creek.

On January 2 and 22, 2017, violent tornadoes passed through the area, claiming several lives and destroying mobile home parks in the process. On October 10, 2018 Hurricane Michael, the first major hurricane (Category 3+) to directly impact Georgia since the 1890s, plowed through South Georgia leaving widespread devastation in its path.

==Geography==
Albany is located at (31.582273, −84.165557), within Southwest Georgia. It lies in a belt of historically rich farmland in the East Gulf coastal plain, on the banks of the Flint River. The city is southeast of Columbus, south of Atlanta, south of Americus, southwest of Macon, west of Tifton, northwest of Valdosta, north of Tallahassee, Florida, east of Eufaula, Alabama, and east of Dothan, Alabama.

, the city of Albany had been a member of the Arbor Day Foundation&#x27;s Tree City USA Program for 23 years. Tree-lined streets are common, with large, mature oaks and other native trees. The city has a tree ordinance, and a certified arborist on staff.

=== Climate ===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Albany has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps. Albany receives well above the national average amount of precipitation. Much of this comes in the form of heavy showers and thunderstorms. According to &quot;Cities Ranked and Rated&quot; (Bert Sperling and Peter Sander), Albany reports thunder on 86 days per year. This is more than twice the national average. 
==Demographics==

At the 1860 U.S. census, the city&#x27;s population was 1,618. Its population has increased to a historic high of 78,122, before experiencing a decline to 69,647 at the 2020 United States census.

Racially and ethnically, Albany forms a part of the Black Belt. The racial and ethnic composition in 2020 was 74.59% Black or African American, 19.71% non-Hispanic white, 0.13% Native American, 0.73% Asian, 0.02% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 2.47% other or multiracial, and 2.36% Hispanic or Latino of any race. According to the American Community Survey of 2022, its racial and ethnic makeup was 75% African American, 19% White, 1% Asian, 2% multiracial, and 3% Hispanic or Latino of any race.

At the 2022 American Community Survey, the city had a median age of 34.7. There was an average of 2.3 persons per household and 27,608 housing units. Approximately 33% were married couples, 19% non-family households, 40% female households, and 7% male households. An estimated 36% of the city population was married.

Among its relatively young population, the city had a median household income of $39,422 with a per capita income of $22,115. More than 60% of the population earned less than $50,000 annually, and 27% earned from $50,000 to $100,000 a year. Of the population, 33.8% lived at or below the poverty line, and 55% of children under age 18 are considered to be in poverty. Approximately 15% of adults 65 and older were considered in poverty.

==Economy==
Today, although the city is surrounded by pecan groves, pine trees, farms and plantations, almost none of the population is employed in agriculture. It has become heavily industrialized, and most business is conducted on a multinational scale. The city developed on both sides of the Flint River.

Health care, education and the Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany are the largest employers. Manufacturing, transportation, and retail trade are also important foundations of Albany&#x27;s economy, and the city acts as a hub for commerce in southwest Georgia.

On December 17, 2008, Cooper Tire and Rubber, one of Albany&#x27;s largest employers, announced plans to close the local manufacturing facility. Approximately 1,400 employees at the plant were projected to lose their jobs.

As a result of the Great Recession, unemployment remained higher in Albany than the country average. In 2012 Albany continued to add more new jobs while other portions of the state were trying to stem the tide of unemployment.

Albany has a skilled workforce, makes continual upgrades to its infrastructure, and has improvements in public safety, such as its ISO fire rating of 2. It has numerous economic development initiatives, such as an Opportunity Zone, which offers a $3,500 tax credit per job created.

Both UPS and DHL use the airport as a sorting facility. In 2010, a master plan was completed. It recommended moving forward with the Replacement Terminal Project.

====Rail====
Freight rail service is provided by Georgia Southwestern Railroad, Georgia and Florida Railway/Omnitrax, and Norfolk Southern Railway. Georgia and Florida Railway has its headquarters in Albany.

Several passenger trains from St. Louis, Chicago and Cincinnati in the Midwest, heading to Florida, made stops in Albany Union Station. The last of these, the Illinois Central&#x27;s &quot;City of Miami&quot; made its final stop there in 1971.

====Bus====
Albany Transit System (ATS) has been operated by the city since 1974 and provides fixed-route and para-transit services in Albany and Dougherty County, including service to the airport. All buses are wheelchair accessible and are equipped with bicycle racks. The main transfer station is in downtown Albany, at the corner of Oglethorpe and Jackson.

In addition, a Greyhound bus station is located in downtown Albany, with connections to interstate service.

====Roads====
===Transportation===
While Albany is one of the largest cities in Georgia to not be served by an interstate, U.S. Route 19 and U.S. Route 82 provide thoroughfares through the city. The two join together north of the city for a short freeway known as the Liberty Expressway. Other major highways that run through the city include Georgia State Route 91, Georgia State Route 133, Georgia State Route 234, and Georgia State Route 520. Albany is located on Georgia State Route 300 (Georgia-Florida Parkway), which provides easy access to Cordele, and Interstate 75 to the northeast and south to Camilla, and Thomasville. The Liberty Expressway spans serves as a bypass on Albany&#x27;s north and east sides. Other highways that pass through Albany include US 19, US 82, and State Routes 3, 62, 91, 133, 234, and 520.

====Bridges====

Albany&#x27;s Broad Avenue Memorial bridge, constructed in 1920 and comprising three open-spandrel concrete deck arch main spans and eight closed-spandrel deck arch spans, was closed in February 2009 after examination found it to be in unsafe condition. Deconstruction began in 2015 and the replacement segmental concrete box girder bridge was dedicated to veterans and opened on November 11, 2015.

In the early 1970s, construction of the Liberty-bypass bridges began. Construction of the bridges over the Flint River was completed much before the highway itself. They became known as the bridges to nowhere.

===Energy infrastructure===

====Georgia Power====
Portions of Albany are serviced by Georgia Power, which operates two electrical power plants within Dougherty County: coal-fired Plant Mitchell and the hydroelectric dam at Lake Worth, also known as Lake Chehaw.

===Water management infrastructure===
The Albany Water, Gas &amp; Light Commission (WG&amp;L) is a municipally-owned and operated utility system furnishing water, gas, and electricity to its broad–based customers. Albany WG&amp;L, was founded in 1892 as the Albany Water Works, as the largest municipal user in Georgia.

The public water supply source for Albany-Dougherty County is groundwater obtained from four aquifers:
* Upper Floridan (locally called the Ocala) Aquifer
* Claiborne (formerly Tallahatta) Aquifer
* Clayton Formation
* Providence Aquifer

The water quality is considered to be excellent, needing only chlorination and fluoridation treatment.

===Communications infrastructure===
Both WG&amp;L and AT&amp;T offer communications infrastructure within the City of Albany.

===Solid waste management===
Albany is served by the Dougherty County Landfill located at 900 Gaissert Road, approximately southeast of the City of Albany.

The Dougherty County Police Department is responsible for the unincorporated area of Dougherty County. The Dougherty County Sheriff&#x27;s Department is a law enforcement agency under the direction of the County Sheriff, an elected official.

As of the 2020 census, the community had a population of 16,644. The area is named for its historic lithia mineral water springs.

Incorporated in 1882, Lithia Springs was dissolved the first time in 1933. Lithia Springs became incorporated again in 1994, to be Douglas County&#x27;s second completely internal municipality, but disincorporated again in 2000.

In 2000, the citizens voted (80% yea, 20% nay) on December 20 to dissolve the city charter and de-incorporate the city, transferring all assets to the county. The referendum that ended the town was part of the settlement in a lawsuit brought by city residents charging the city should be dissolved because it did not deliver enough services to justify its existence under state law. During its incorporation until 2000, the former city had five mayors.

Lithia Springs is assigned the United States Postal Service ZIP code of 30122.

==History==
The history of the community began with Lithia Springs, a natural lithia water spring. So popular were the curative waters that flowed from Lithia Springs that people came for miles to drink it. The neighboring city of Austell was also founded due to the spring&#x27;s popularity.

In 1887 Judge Bowden bought the springs with a group of investors and started bottling and selling Bowden lithia spring water. That same year the Sweet Water Hotel, a 300-room luxury health resort, opened in Lithia Springs. The hotel and its famous lithia spring water were so popular that Mark Twain, members of the Vanderbilt family, and Presidents Cleveland, Taft, McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt all enjoyed the many amenities of the resort, which included the world-famous Lithia Vapor Baths.

In 1888, the Piedmont Chautauqua Institute opened in Lithia Springs. Henry W. Grady, editor of the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot;, was the founder and gave the institute the motto &quot;Enlightenment of the People&quot;. In 1888, over 30,000 tourists, sightseers, and health-seekers visited Lithia Springs.

The only remnants of this time that have survived are the natural springs and its historic lithia water under the name brand Lithia, which is still bottled and sold in restaurants and health food stores.

==Geography==
Lithia Springs is located in the northeastern corner of Douglas County, bordered to the north and east by the Cobb County line and to the south by East County Line Road, Cedar Terrace Road, and Factory Shoals Road. Sweetwater Creek, a tributary of the Chattahoochee River, flows through the eastern part of the community, and Sweetwater Creek State Park is along its southern edge.

Some of the incorporated limits of Douglasville occupy some of the territory around Lithia Springs, along Interstate 20, Blair Bridge Road, Lee Road and Thornton Road.

<text>Jakin is a city in Early County, Georgia, United States. Incorporated in 1895, Jakin&#x27;s population was 131 in 2020.

==History==
Early County was created by an act of the General Assembly on December 15, 1818. Land lots of surveyed in 1819 and 1820 were distributed by the state in lotteries. Jakin is in the 26th land district in the southernmost end of the county.

As early as 1817 settlers began moving into the area and began to build on the old Indian paths along the river. These old paths became the Old River Road in 1820 and a post road by the mid 1820s. The post riders were often harassed by Indians. As the forests along the river were cleared, large plantations and fine frame homes began to appear. The Chattahoochee River, to the west, was the main source of transportation, bearing downstream huge square-cut timbers to Apalachicola, Florida, for ship building and turpentine for export, and bearing cotton upstream to the cotton mills in Columbus. In 1821 the Armstrong and Attaway Company built the first cotton gin at nearby Saffold Navy Yard.

The first families established here were the Allens, Rambos, Donalsons, Harrells, Shewmakes, Saffolds, Johnsons, Hayes, Gibsons, Crawfords, and Moodys. In 1828 a road was made from Blakely to Bainbridge on which settled the Hodges, Warrens, Minters, Easoms and Perrys. These families pioneered what became Jakin.

In May 1878 C.A. Minter, a physician, purchased three lots, roughly of land, for $10 and a shotgun. The first mayor of Jakin, James Morris &quot;Major&quot; Bivings, named the town &quot;Jakin&quot; after one of the columns of Solomon&#x27;s temple.

In addition to small farm agriculture, Jakin&#x27;s early economic growth resulted from turpentine. The unspoiled longleaf pine forests were prime resources, first for turpentine then lumber. Bivings and his partner, James W. Duke of Chicago, founded the Duke and Bivings Lumber Company complete with housing, commissary and post office. Bivings served as the first postmaster. On January 3, 1898, the Flowers Company purchased the lumber mill for $20,000. In addition to machines, buildings and materials, the purchase included of land and a railway. According to published town history, an estimated 1,000 workers were employed by the mill. In 1903 Jakin&#x27;s population was 2,000. World War I and deforestation led to the closure of the lumber mill in 1918.

Agriculture served as Jakin&#x27;s main industry until 1963, with Great Northern Nekoosa&#x27;s purchase of a family-owned lumber mill which later became Great Southern Paper, which also ran a plywood mill in nearby Cedar Springs. Great Southern Paper was acquired by Georgia-Pacific in 1990. In 2005 GP was acquired by the privately held Koch Industries. Despite changing ownership, the mill has operated continuously.
==Geography==
Jakin is located in southern Early County at (31.090574, -84.983179). U.S. Route 84 passes through the southern part of the town, leading southeast to Donalsonville and northwest to Dothan, Alabama. Blakely, the Early County seat, is to the north via Jakin Road.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Jakin has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 157 people, 71 households, and 42 families residing in the city. In 2020, its population was 131.

==Education==
Jakin is served by the Early County School District schools in Blakely: Early County Elementary School, Early County Middle School, and Early County High School.

It was formerly the site of Jakin High School.

<doc id="110069" wikidata="Q2611100" url="?curid=110069" title="Guyton, Georgia">
<text>Guyton is a city in Effingham County, Georgia, United States. The population was 2,289 at the 2020 census, up from 1,684 in 2010. Guyton is located northwest of downtown Savannah, and is part of the Savannah metropolitan statistical area. 

==History==
While some of the early settlers came from the Savannah area, it seems that most came from North and South Carolina. In 1792 a tract of of land in the form of a land warrant from Effingham County was issued to Squire Zachariah White. The community became known as &quot;Whitesville&quot;. The Squire was not married and left no heir when he died in 1838. White had granted a right-of-way to the new Central of Georgia Railway Co. prior to his death. He was buried on his own land, as was the custom then. His grave is in the rear of the present New Providence Church. Years later, a local controversy was started when some of this community tried to have Squire White&#x27;s grave moved to the new local cemetery. It was never moved.

Shortly after White&#x27;s death, the Effingham County Commissioners took over his land for unpaid taxes. They had a survey made, laid off lots and streets just as they still are today, and sold it all at public auction as payment of his taxes. Many lots were bought by affluent Savannah residents as a place for a summer home. At this time, the fever was very bad in Savannah.

When the Central of Georgia Railroad Company, having a charter to build and operate a railroad from Savannah to Macon and on to Marthasville (now Atlanta), laid their track through Whitesville in 1837 or 1838, they referred to this place as Station Number 30. After a short time, locals asked the railroad company to give this place a name so they could request the federal government to place a post office here. Since there was another town in the state named Whitesville, Mr. W. W. Gordon, President of the Central Railroad, named this location &quot;Guyton&quot;, after Archibald Guyton, a prominent local citizen. The U. S. Post Office established a post office at Guyton, Georgia, December 31, 1851.

Guyton was an affluent town by the time of the Civil War. During the Civil War, the Confederacy built a hospital in Guyton. There are 26 Confederate soldiers buried in the local cemetery. When General Sherman marched from Atlanta to Savannah on his burn and destroy mission, he came through Guyton with his main body of troops. It took five days for his army to pass through, with some of his troops looting, burning, and stealing. The depot and tracks were destroyed, which could explain why some records of this period are not complete.

In 1887, Guyton was incorporated and issued a town charter by the State of Georgia. The local member of the Georgia Legislature who had the bill introduced and passed was Colonel Clarance Guyton, a grandson of Archibald Guyton.

The Guyton City Hall has had many requests for information about the family of Guytons. However, little is known about their background. They were rumored to have come from England to North Carolina. Archibald Guyton came to this area from North Carolina in 1825. He was married twice. His first wife was the widow Tondee of Savannah. There is a Tondee farm or plantation listed in Effingham County near Guyton during this period, so she may have had connections there. The Georgia census of 1850 shows Archibald came to Georgia in 1825. He was in the timber business. His first wife, widow Tondee died (fever) and is buried in the old Providence Baptist Cemetery. His second wife was Harriet Patterson, of this area. Archibald had a son, Robert, by his first wife and a son, Charles, by his second wife. There were several girls also as are listed in his cemetery plot. Archibald&#x27;s grandson, Clarance, was an attorney and maintained a law office in Savannah. Everyone called him Colonel Guyton. He was a member of the Georgia Legislature and was very prominent.

There are no families named Guyton living in the community today. The last Guyton family home, which was occupied by Clarance, his sister Belle Hendry, and also his sister Tallullah and her husband Fred Seckinger is still in excellent condition. It is located on Highway 17, just north of the Guyton city limits.

Every December, the spirit of Christmas is highlighted in Guyton with an annual tour of homes. This community-sponsored event will usually host around three to four thousand visitors every year. Visitors will usually tour about a dozen homes, and nearly all of the churches are open for the tour. Many homes in the historic district will have lighted doors. The festivities usually begin with a country supper and tour of the historical city. As visitors drive down main street in Guyton, they can view the lighted trees that line the old railroad median for . The Guyton Volunteer Fire Department usually illuminates the nearly 7,000 lights each year on the Saturday following Thanksgiving.

Today, Guyton is still a small town, but one with much history. As visitors drive through its narrow lanes and streets, particularly in December of each year, they see a Georgia town pretty much the way it was nearly a century ago.

==Geography==

Guyton is located in west-central Effingham County at (32.336338, -81.393763). State Routes 17 and 119 cross in the southwest part of town.

<doc id="110070" wikidata="Q2396741" url="?curid=110070" title="Rincon, Georgia">
<text>Rincon is a city in Effingham County, Georgia, United States. The 2020 population was 10,934, up from 8,836 at the 2010 census. Rincon is part of the Savannah metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
Rincon, in the southeast area of Effingham County, Georgia, was incorporated as a city in 1927. While the earliest settlers came to the area in 1751, the area had little development until the late 19th century.
During the American Civil War, when forces of the Union Army penetrated the South, thousands of slaves escaped from plantations to go to their lines. Many fell in with the forces of Union General William Tecumseh Sherman and followed his March to the Sea. Hundreds of fugitive African-Americans drowned during the campaign while trying to cross Ebenezer Creek near the site of present-day Rincon, outside of Savannah. In 2010 the Georgia Historical Society erected a historical marker about this event, as part of a major project to memorialize little-known events from the Civil War era and recognize African-American sacrifices for freedom.

Rincon&#x27;s development was catalyzed by the coming of the railroad in the 1890s. A rail line was built from the Carolinas across the state line at the Savannah River and southward to Savannah. The name of the city is believed to have been adopted from the Spanish or Mexican name &quot;Rincón,&quot; after a small but prosperous town in Mexico. (&quot;Rincón&quot; means &quot;corner&quot;, more specifically an inside corner as one might refer to a nook, cove, or a more isolated location.)

Once the railroad and depot were built at Rincon, a telegraph operator or agent was on duty as early as about 1895. This opened up the area to long-distance communication. In addition to the railroad, a &quot;dirt&quot; road (now improved as State Highway 21) was built northwest from Savannah to Rincon and beyond, and other country roads were developed in the area. Rincon became a small hive of trading activity. The surrounding farmers, sawmill operators and the like, who had taken their products of cotton and lumber to Savannah, could &quot;wagon&quot; to Rincon to ship by rail. They also could receive shipments there and travel as rail passengers.

About the time of World War I, there was a spurt of local activity. Some men served in the military, and many locals in and around Rincon commuted daily to work in shipbuilding and other war-related plants in Port Wentworth and Savannah. Soon after the war, new homes were built or completed by new residents and old.

Residents established a grade school for white students about 1900 in an old two-story building opposite the Lutheran church. A few years later the school was relocated into a new two-story building between 4th and 5th streets. It had a steeple belltower and bell to signal recess and lunch periods, and the daily opening and closing of school. That building was used for at least 40 years for both grade school and high school. First known as the Effingham Institute. Its name was changed in the early 1920s to Rincon High School. Racial segregation continued to exclude African Americans from this school.

By 1929 the corporate government of the small town had become inactive, in part due to the small population. Sometime later, however, the population began to increase. By 1950 the population was 454. By 1955 it was 650 and by 1960 it was 1,057. Rincon was reincorporated and organized as the Town of Rincon around the end of 1954. The incorporated limits of Rincon originally formed a circle having a diameter of , with the center at the site of the old (now gone) railroad depot, but annexations of land since the late 20th century have changed this shape.

In approximately 1934, Georgia State Route 21 was paved from the Chatham County line in the south, northward through Rincon and Springfield and beyond. In about 1939, electric lines were installed, and electric power was supplied from the Savannah Electric and Power Company, replacing private individual small plants. These improvements were made during the Great Depression to provide jobs to working men, with assistance from the federal government under the WPA program of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose administration invested heavily in infrastructure in the South.

In late 1955, Rincon installed its own city pump, tank, lines and water system, enabling &quot;running water&quot; throughout for the first time. In 1956, a volunteer fire department was organized. Also beginning in that year, many arterials and streets were paved.

As suburban development has expanded outward from Savannah, since 1990 the population of Rincon has grown rapidly, rising from 2,697 in 1990 to an estimated 9,638 in 2014.

==Geography==
Rincon is located in southeastern Effingham County at (32.293258, -81.234171). Georgia State Route 21 passes through the town, leading northwest to Springfield, the county seat, and south to Savannah.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 10,934 people, 3,827 households, and 2,537 families residing in the city.

Elberton claims the title &quot;granite capital of the world&quot;. The city&#x27;s post-Civil War history has largely revolved around the industry, following the opening of the first commercial quarry and manufacturing plant by Nathaniel Long in 1889. As the industry grew in the early 1900s, so did Elberton&#x27;s importance on the passenger and freight railroad lines, bringing many travelers and businessmen to the city and leading to its heyday.

Several granite monuments, including the now-destructed Georgia Guidestones, are located in or near Elberton.

<doc id="110077" wikidata="Q2541889" url="?curid=110077" title="Oak Park, Georgia">
<text>Oak Park is a city in Emanuel County, Georgia, United States. The population was 484 at the 2010 census, up from 366 in 2000. By 2020, its population was 512.

==History==
The town was originally named Sol, Georgia from June to August 1880 then the town name was changed to Horace, Georgia. The town name was later changed to Oak Park, Georgia in 1904.

In 1914 a murder–suicide committed by local farmer J.A. Eubanks got national news coverage. He murdered his wife and two daughters with an axe, set fire to some farm buildings, and shot himself in the head. Before killing himself, he woke a neighbor and told them what he had done. He did leave a suicide note. Several structures were destroyed in the fire, including houses of others. He had even cut the rope for the well bucket to keep the fire from being put out.

In a December 14, 1934 municipal election, Oak Park elected a mayor and five-person town council composed entirely of women. The election of an all-woman government was a first for Georgia, and novel enough that the event was covered by Associated Press and United Press news stories, both calling it &quot;Petticoat Rule&quot;. It was not a surprise to the town however, as the all-woman slate had been nominated by men when the previous mayor retired and no men volunteered to replace him.

Some in the town apparently dissented, as the jail was set ablaze the night before the election and dynamite blasts were set off after it, damaging buildings. Despite that, Mrs. Solomon S. Youmans (the wife of a local physician) was elected mayor, and the council consisted of Mrs. J.D. Tyson, Mrs. G.C. Corbin, Mrs. J.J. Powell, Mrs. G.C. Williamson and Miss Ada Belle Thompson.

==Geography==

Oak Park is located in southern Emanuel County at (32.370747, -82.309915), along U.S. Route 1. Interstate 16 passes through the northern part of the town, north of the original town center, with access to US 1 from Exit 90. I-16 leads east to Savannah and west to Macon, while US 1 leads north to Swainsboro, the Emanuel County seat, and south to Lyons.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Oak Park has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.17%, is water.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 512 people, 238 households, and 166 families residing in the town.

<text>Swainsboro is a city in Emanuel County, Georgia, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 7,425. The city is the county seat of Emanuel County.

==History==
In 1822, the Georgia state legislature established &quot;Swainsborough&quot; as the seat of Emanuel County. The town was named in recognition of Stephen Swain, the state senator who introduced the bill for the county&#x27;s creation in 1812. The town&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Paris&quot; at its incorporation on February 18, 1854, but three years later reverted to its current name, Swainsboro.

===Transportation===
Early in its corporate life, much like other rural Georgia towns, Swainsboro depended on railroads for transportation. However, in the 1930s, many of the town&#x27;s streets and sidewalks were paved, and Swainsboro found itself at the intersection of two major national highways, U.S. 1 and U.S. 80, thus earning its city motto: &quot;Crossroads of the Great South&quot;. U.S. 1 was the principal highway from Maine to Key West, and U.S. 80, at that time, ran from Tybee Island, Georgia, to San Diego.
==Geography==

Swainsboro is located near the center of Emanuel County at 32°35&#x27;37&quot; North, 82°19&#x27;56&quot; West (32.593743, -82.332146). U.S. Route 80 passes through the center of the city, and U.S. Route 1 bypasses it to the west. US 80 leads east to Statesboro and west to Dublin, while US 1 leads north to Augusta and south to Waycross. Interstate 16 is south of Swainsboro via US 1.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.81%, is water.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 7,425 people, 2,697 households, and 1,783 families residing in the city.

<text>Claxton is a city in Evans County, Georgia, United States. The population was 2,602 in 2020. It is the county seat of Evans County.

==History==
The town had its visionary, W.R. Hendricks. In May 1890 there were only a couple of dwellings scattered around the area that is Claxton. Hendricks, son of Glenn and Nancy Hendricks, had been given a large tract of land by his parents. The Hendricks&#x27;s ambition was to secure a railroad station at the site, but they met considerable opposition from railroad company officials who maintained that existing stations in the area were sufficient to meet the needs. W.R. Hendricks made a proposition to railroad officials that a well be dug and pump installed free of charge so that trains could stop for water. The deal was made and actual construction began in the latter part of June 1890. The vision of building a town was fully supported by Hendricks&#x27;s mother, who offered to give a lot to anyone who would erect a building upon it. A number of people accepted her offer, so she revised the plan and proposed to sell one lot and give an adjoining parcel to ones who desired to build.

With the establishment of a town well underway, efforts were begun to establish a post office at the settlement already widely known as &quot;Hendricks&quot;. Postal officials in Washington, D.C., upon receiving an application from George E. Wood, declined to approve the name, because a post office in the state was already operating under that name in Upson County. Two other names were then submitted, &quot;Jenny&quot; and &quot;Claxton&quot;. Postal officials agreed to Claxton, and the post office opened in 1890.

There is some dispute about the origin of the name. Some local historians contend that the name of a popular actress, Kate Claxton, was the source, while others believe it was in honor of Philander Priestly Claxton, a noted educator of the time.

Shortly after the Claxton post office opened, D.C. Newton, one of the partners in a naval stores company, laid out on a sheet of brown wrapping paper what became the original map of Claxton. Newton drew in the streets, laid out lots and later added street names. The whereabouts of the original map is not known; however, it is believed that this first map remained in his possession until his death and was passed down to his son who died in the 1990s. Another map, believed to be similar to the original, was in the possession of R.R. &quot;Bobby&quot; Tippins, president of Tippins Bank and Trust Company and descendant of the family who founded the bank in Claxton; he died in the 2000s.

The town is also the center of an adoption scandal.

==Geography==
McCaysville is located along the northern border of Fannin County and the state of Georgia at (34.981534, -84.370293). It is bordered to the north by its twin city of Copperhill, Tennessee. The two are situated as a single town along a river, known as the Toccoa River in Georgia and the Ocoee River in Tennessee. The change takes place in the middle of town at the state line, which runs diagonally relative to the street grid, which is aligned with the river rather than the border. The boundary also means that the McCaysville side is in area code 706, while the Copperhill side is in area code 423.

The main street through town is Georgia 60 (Toccoa Avenue) and Tennessee 68 (Ocoee Street). SR 60 leads southeast to Mineral Bluff, Georgia, while SR 68 leads north to Ducktown, Tennessee. Georgia State Route 5 crosses the Toccoa River and leads south to Blue Ridge, the Fannin County seat.

According to the United States Census Bureau, McCaysville has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.17%, is water.

In the early morning hours of February 16, 1990, a massive flood struck the towns.

==Climate==

McCaysville&#x27;s weather is temperate due to its elevation and location in the southern Appalachians. Summers are warm with average highs in the middle 80s and lows in the lower 60s. Winters are cool with average highs in the 40s and average lows in the 20s. Rainfall is abundant with the yearly average approaching 67 inches and occurring on 127 days. Snowfall usually occurs on several occasions during the winter months and can range from a light dusting to the occasional significant storm. The most significant snow storm to hit the area occurred March 12–14, 1993, when the area received approximately 40 inches in what eastern seaboard residents often refer to as &quot;the storm of the century&quot;. The average first frost occurs in mid-October with the average last frost occurring in late April.

Although businesses were on the rise in the small town, the main source of economy for the town was farming.

Cotton was the number one crop for a long time until 1921 when the boll weevil appeared, quickly destroying crops, placing the town into an economic depression, and causing it to lose its charter. By the time the Great Depression struck the country, Brooks had been suffering for eight years. The town began to come out of the depression in 1939 after electricity was installed in the town. Around this time Brooks received its town charter again. Another factor in the growth of the town was due to the rise in the airline industry. Airline employees from Atlanta began to buy large tracts of farmland. Farming also changed as the focus switched from cotton to cattle.

==Education==
Brooks&#x27; education falls under the Fayette County Board of Education. Middle school students attend Whitewater Middle, and high school students attend Whitewater High School in Fayetteville, both of which are of recent construction. Liberty Tech Charter school is using the old Brooks Elementary School building; there has been a school at this location since 1909. Brooks Elementary closed in 2013.

<text>Fayetteville ( ; locally ) is a city in and the county seat of Fayette County, Georgia, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 18,957, up from 15,945 at the 2010 census. Fayetteville is located south of downtown Atlanta.

==History==
Fayetteville was founded in 1822 as the seat of the newly formed Fayette County, organized by European Americans from territory ceded by force the Creek people under a treaty with the United States during the early period of Indian removal from the Southeast. Both city and county were named in honor of the Revolutionary War hero the French Marquis de Lafayette. Fayetteville was incorporated as a town in 1823 and as a city in 1902.

The area was developed for cotton plantations, with labor provided by enslaved African Americans, who for more than a century comprised the majority of the county&#x27;s population. Fayetteville became the trading town for the agricultural area.

In the first half of the 20th century, as agriculture became more mechanized, many African-American workers left the area in the Great Migration to northern and midwestern industrial cities, which had more jobs and offered less oppressive social conditions.

A reverse migration has brought new residents to the South, and the city of Fayetteville has grown markedly since 1980, as has the county. The city&#x27;s population increased from 2715 in 1980 to 18,957 in 2020.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 18,957 people, 6,833 households, and 4,833 families residing in the city.

==Government==
The city has a mayor-council form of elected government. Five council members are elected at-large, in non-partisan post, and the mayor is elected at-large in a non-partisan race.

In 2015 Ed Johnson was elected mayor, the first African American to serve in the position. The retired US Naval Commander and pastor of Fayette County&#x27;s oldest black church is described as a consensus builder. In 2011 Johnson was elected as the first black member of the city council after having served three terms as president of the local chapter of the NAACP.

Johnson was re-elected in 2019.

==Education==
The city is served by the Fayette County Board of Education.

In 2016, a soundstage at Pinewood Studios was open for educational use by the Georgia Film Academy. In late 2020, the Georgia Film Academy partnered with Trilith and the University of Georgia to launch its Master of Fine Arts film program; students would work and live in Trilith during their second year. Trilith also has a small K-12 school called the Forest School.

Georgia Military College has a campus in Fayetteville.

==Points of interest==

The Fayette County Courthouse, built in 1825 four years after the county and town&#x27;s founding, is the oldest surviving courthouse in Georgia. It is located in the center of the Fayetteville town square. Since the construction of a new courthouse, the 1825 building has been adapted for use as the local welcome center. It holds offices for Fayetteville Main Street and the Fayette County Development Authority.

The Holliday-Dorsey-Fife House was built in 1855 by John Stiles Holliday, uncle of the western gambler John Henry &quot;Doc&quot; Holliday.

The Margaret Mitchell Library, built in 1948 and named in honor of the author, serves as the headquarters of the Fayette County Historical Society. Among its holdings are Civil War and genealogical records.

The residence formally occupied by deceased professional wrestler Chris Benoit and his nuclear family until June 2007, within which a high-profile double-murder and suicide tragedy occurred, is located in Fayetteville.

Trilith Studios, then Pinewood Atlanta Studios, opened here in 2014; it was a joint venture between British company Pinewood Group and River&#x27;s Rock LLC, an independently managed trust of the Cathy family, founders of the Chick-fil-A fast-food chain. In 2020 River&#x27;s Rock bought out Pinewood&#x27;s share of the studio. It is the largest film and television production studio in the United States outside the state of California. The studio has produced many large budget films, including several in the Marvel Cinematic Universe such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Black Panther&quot;.

In 2016, the Pinewood Forest mixed-use complex was launched. Located across the street from the studio, it features homes along with plans for &quot;a movie theater, restaurants, boutique hotels, retail and office space&quot;, built using environmentally friendly building materials. In 2020, when the studio was renamed Trilith Studios, Pinewood Forest was renamed the Town at Trilith. In April 2021, &quot;Atlanta&quot; magazine ranked the community ninth in their top ten metro Atlanta vibrant city centers list; the community was also the newest featured on the list.

With Raleigh Studios in nearby Senoia, Peachtree City has often been the backdrop for episodes of other series, such as &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;. Scenes from the film &quot;Joyful Noise&quot; were shot there as well.

The 2019 film &quot;Greener Grass&quot; was filmed here and the city&#x27;s unique transport life features heavily. The film&#x27;s setting is a fantastical location and not the real Peachtree City.

For the production of &quot;Megalopolis&quot;, Francis Ford Coppola purchased a drive-in Days Inn motel located in Peachtree City for $4.35million to reside in and accommodate the crew and his extended family. The building was later opened to the public on July 5, 2024, as the All-Movie Hotel. Memorabilia from Coppola&#x27;s previous films is displayed throughout the hotel.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Golf carts====

Peachtree City has a system of golf cart paths which spider across the town and provide a secondary means of access to almost any destination within city limits. These multi-use paths stretch for more than throughout the city. Many places of business have specially designated golf cart parking spaces. The Peachtree City Police Department has several golf carts used to patrol along these paths.

Over 10,000 households own a golf cart, and use them as an extra vehicle for local transportation. Children aged twelve to fifteen may operate a cart on Peachtree City cart paths with a parent, grandparent or other guardian in the front seat. Those who are fifteen or older, with either a valid Georgia learner&#x27;s permit or a full driver&#x27;s license, are allowed to operate golf carts alone. Students at McIntosh High School are encouraged to drive family golf carts to school because of limited car parking. In 2015, Starr&#x27;s Mill High School opened a golf-cart specific lot. The golf cart paths are also used by cyclists, joggers, and pedestrians as a safer alternative to the side of the road. In February 2003, &quot;Golf Digest&quot; magazine discussed the traffic congestion caused by the use of golf carts in the city.

====Airports====
Atlanta Regional Airport, also known as Falcon Field, is a general aviation airport that provides chartered air service. Since 1987, it has grown from having about 60 aircraft based at the airport to about 165. The runway is long and holds up to of aircraft. It mainly serves Peachtree City&#x27;s business residents, but also serves as a place of entertainment for people interested. There is a viewing area provided for the public to watch aircraft take-off and land. The airport hosts many events throughout the year, including the Great Georgia Air Show. The airport is the location of a National Weather Service radar station, Southeast River Forecast Center, and Weather Forecast Office, which serves 96 counties in northern and central Georgia.

Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport provides commercial service and is located northeast of Peachtree City via Georgia State Route 74 and Interstate 85.

Peachtree City was designated a foreign-trade zone by the U.S. Customs Service. In the U.S., a foreign-trade zone is a site in or near a U.S. Customs port of entry (in this case Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport), designated free of customs entry procedures.

<doc id="110094" wikidata="Q3261108" url="?curid=110094" title="Cave Spring, Georgia">
<text>Cave Spring is a city in Floyd County, Georgia, United States. It is located southwest of Rome, the county seat. The population of Cave Spring was 1,200 at the 2010 census, up from 975 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Rome, Georgia Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The town is named for its natural limestone cave and mineral spring site which serves as the main source of drinking water for nearby communities. The spring flows from the cave into a rock holding pond in Rolater Park and then into a swimming pool constructed of stones.

Spring water is piped to local homes and businesses by the public-utility service of Cave Spring. Visitors may also bring jugs to fill at the spring and take home for drinking.

==Geography==
Cave Spring is located in southwestern Floyd County at (34.108912, -85.336018). U.S. Route 411 passes through the city, leading northeast to Rome and west to Gadsden, Alabama.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city of Cave Spring has a total area of , of which , or 0.36%, is water.

== History ==
The town of Cave Spring dates to 1832, but the community is much older. Historically, indigenous peoples of the area (both Cherokee and the earlier Mississippian culture) used the site for drinking water, tribal meetings, and games, according to legend.

The town was founded in 1832 by Baptists who were among its early settlers. It takes its name from a clear water spring which still serves as the main source of drinking water for Cave Spring and nearby communities. The water is now delivered by a modern pumping system and has won awards for purity and taste.

The spring flows from its source inside the cave into a small rock pool or open reservoir, separated from a larger duck pond. Both ponds are located just outside the cave entrance, which is fronted by a man-made rock wall. These improvements were added as part of Rolater Park, named in 1921.

The wall encloses a lobby leading to the natural cave entrance, which widens to a larger cavity. The cave features limestone formations; one, a large stalagmite, is named the Devil&#x27;s Stool. There is also a manmade staircase inside the cave for those who want to view the formations from above.

The park site was formerly used by educational institutions such as Cave Spring Manual Labor School (renamed Hearn Academy) and others including Georgia School for the Deaf. During the Atlanta Campaign of the Civil War in 1864, both Confederate and Union troops came to Cave Spring for hospitalization and rest.

Cave Spring has historic homes and buildings from its early years, such as the 1867 Presbyterian Church, 1880 train depot, and 19th century hotels and boarding houses.

<text>Rome is the largest city in and the county seat of Floyd County, Georgia, United States. Located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, it is the principal city of the Rome, Georgia, metropolitan statistical area, which encompasses all of Floyd County. At the 2020 census, the city had a population of 37,713. It is the largest city in Northwest Georgia and the 26th-largest city in the state.

Rome was founded in 1834, after Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, and the federal government committed to removing the Cherokee and other Native Americans from the Southeast. It developed on former indigenous territory at the confluence of the Etowah and the Oostanaula rivers, which together form the Coosa River. Because of its strategic advantages, this area was long occupied by the historic Creek. Later the Cherokee people expanded into this area from their traditional homelands to the east and northeast. National leaders such as Major Ridge and John Ross resided here before Indian Removal in 1838.

The city has developed on seven hills with the rivers running between them, a feature that inspired the early European-American settlers to name it for Rome, that was also built on seven hills. The American Rome developed in the antebellum period as a market and trading city due to its advantageous location on the rivers. It shipped the rich regional cotton commodity crop downriver to markets on the Gulf Coast and export overseas.

In the late 1920s, a United States company built a rayon plant in a joint project with an Italian company. This project and the American city of Rome were honored by Italy in 1929, when Benito Mussolini sent a replica of the statue of Romulus and Remus nursing from a mother wolf, a symbol of the founding myth of the original Rome.

It is the largest city near the center of the triangular area defined by the Interstate highways between Atlanta, Birmingham, and Chattanooga. It has developed as a regional center for the fields of medical care and education. In addition to its public-school system, it has several private schools. Higher-level institutions include private Berry College and Shorter University, and the public Georgia Northwestern Technical College and Georgia Highlands College.

== History ==
=== Indigenous history ===
The Abihka tribe of Creek in the area of Rome later became part of the Upper Creek people (who occupied the Northern Creek territory, called themselves the Muscogee). They merged with other Creek tribes to become the &quot;Ulibahali&quot;, who later migrated westward into Alabama in the general region of Gadsden. By the mid-18th century, the Iroquoian-speaking Cherokee had moved into this area and occupied it. They had moved down from areas of Tennessee, under pressure from settlement by Americans migrating across the Appalachians from eastern territories.

A Cherokee village named Etowah (), which means &quot;Head of Coosa&quot;, was settled in this area during the late 18th century, in the period of the Cherokee–American wars (1776–94) during and after the American Revolutionary War. Several Cherokee national leaders settled here and developed their own cotton plantations, including chiefs Major Ridge and John Ross. Some of the Cherokee planters and others among the Southeast tribes bought enslaved African Americans to use as laborers on such plantations.

In the 20th century, Ridge&#x27;s home here was preserved as Chieftain&#x27;s House. It has been adapted by the state for use as the Chieftains Museum. It is used to interpret the history of the Cherokee in this area, especially Major Ridge.

In the 18th century, a high demand in Europe for American deerskins had led to a brisk trade between Indian hunters and White traders. A few White traders and some settlers (primarily from the Southern Colonies of Georgia and Carolina) were accepted by the Head of Coosa Cherokee. These were later joined by Christian missionaries, and more settlers. After the American War of Independence, most new settlers came from the area of Georgia east of the Proclamation Line of 1763.

In 1793, in response to a Cherokee raid into Tennessee, John Sevier, the Governor of Tennessee, led a retaliatory raid against the Cherokee in the vicinity of Myrtle Hill, in what was known as the Battle of Hightower.

In 1802, the United States and Georgia executed the Compact of 1802, in which Georgia sold its claimed western lands (a claim dating to its colonial charter) to the United States. In return, the federal government agreed to ignore Cherokee land titles and remove all Cherokee from Georgia. The commitment to evict the Cherokee was not immediately enforced, and Chiefs John Ross and Major Ridge led efforts to stop their removal, including several federal lawsuits.

During the 1813 Creek Civil War, most Cherokee took the side of the Lower Creek Indians, who were more assimilated and willing to deal with European Americans, against the Red Sticks or Upper Creek. As they had lived more isolated from the Whites, they had maintained strong, conservative cultural traditions. Before the Cherokee moved to Head of Coosa, Chief Ridge commanded a company of warriors as a unit of the Tennessee militia, with Chief Ross as adjutant. This Cherokee unit was under the overall command of United States Major Andrew Jackson, and supported the Upper Creek. They were the part of the Creek who had adopted more European-American customs and were more aligned with American settlers. The Creek War played out within the American Revolutionary War of the War of 1812.

In 1829, European Americans discovered gold near Dahlonega, Georgia, starting the first gold rush in the United States. Congressional passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which fulfilled the Compact of 1802, was related to that gold discovery and the desire of Whites to settle the land, as well as President Andrew Jackson&#x27;s commitment to removal of Native Americans to enable development by the whites.

Even before removal began, in 1831, Georgia&#x27;s General Assembly passed legislation that claimed all Cherokee land in Northwest Georgia. This entire territory was called Cherokee County; the following year, the Assembly organized the territory as the nine counties that still exist in the 21st century.

=== City founding period ===
Rome was founded in 1834 as European Americans increasingly settled in Georgia. Founders were Col. Daniel R. Mitchell, Col. Zacharia Hargrove, Maj. Philip Hemphill, Col. William Smith, and John Lumpkin (nephew of Governor Lumpkin); most were veterans of the War of 1812. They held a drawing at Alhambra to determine the name of the new city, with Col. Mitchell submitting the name of Rome because of the area&#x27;s hills and rivers. Mitchell&#x27;s submission was drawn, and the Georgia Legislature chartered Rome as an official city in 1835. The county seat was subsequently moved east from the village of Livingston to Rome.

With the entire area still occupied primarily by Cherokee, the city developed to serve the agrarian needs of the new cotton-based economy. Invention of the cotton gin in the late 18th century made processing of short-staple cotton profitable. This was the type of cotton that best thrived in the upland areas, in contrast to that grown on the Sea Islands and in the Low Country.

Much of upland Georgia was developed as what became known as the Black Belt, named for the fertile soil. Planters brought or purchased many enslaved African Americans as workers for the labor-intensive crop. The leading Cherokee participated in the cultivation of cotton as a commodity crop, which soon replaced deerskin trading as a source of wealth in the region. The first steamboat navigated the Coosa River to Rome in 1836, reducing the time-to-market for the cotton trade and speeding travel between Rome and New Orleans on the Gulf Coast, the major port for export of cotton.

By 1838, the Cherokee had run out of legal options in resisting removal. They were the last of the major Southeast tribes to be forcibly moved to the Indian Territory (in modern-day Oklahoma) on the Trail of Tears. After the removal of the Cherokee, their homes and businesses were taken over by Whites, with much of the property distributed through a land lottery.

The Rome economy continued to grow. In 1849, an rail spur to the Western and Atlantic Railroad in Kingston was completed, significantly improving transportation to the east. This route was later followed in the 20th-century construction of Georgia Highway 293. By 1860 the population had reached 4,010 in the city, and 15,195 in the county.

=== Civil war period ===
Rome&#x27;s iron works were an important manufacturing center during the Civil War, supplying many cannons and other armaments to the Confederate effort. In April 1863, the city was defended by Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest against Union Colonel Abel Streight&#x27;s &quot;lightning mule&quot; raid from the area east of modern-day Cedar Bluff, Alabama. General Forrest tricked Colonel Streight into surrendering just a few miles shy of Rome. Realizing their vulnerability, Rome&#x27;s city council had allocated $3,000 to build three fortifications. Although these became operational by October 1863, efforts to strengthen the forts continued as the war progressed. These forts were named after Romans who had been killed in action: Fort Attaway was on the western bank of the Oostanaula River, Fort Norton was on the eastern bank of the Oostanaula, and Fort Stovall was on the southern bank of the Etowah River. The Confederates later built at least one other fort on the northern side of the Coosa River.


In May 1864, Union General Jefferson C. Davis, under the command of Major General William Tecumseh Sherman, attacked and captured Rome when the outflanked Confederate defenders retreated under command of Major General Samuel Gibbs French. Union General William Vandever was stationed in Rome and is shown with his staff in a photograph taken there. Due to Rome&#x27;s forts and iron works, which included the manufacture of cannons, Rome was a significant target during Sherman&#x27;s march through Georgia to take and destroy Confederate resources. Davis&#x27; forces occupied Rome for several months, making repairs to use the damaged forts and briefly quartering General Sherman. On November 11, 1864, in accordance with Sherman&#x27;s Special Field Orders, No. 120, Union forces destroyed Rome&#x27;s forts, iron works, the rail line to Kingston, and any other materiel that could be useful to the South&#x27;s war effort as they withdrew from Rome to participate in Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea.

=== Reconstruction era and 19th century===
In 1871, Rome constructed a water tank on Neely Hill, which overlooks the downtown district. This later was adapted as a clock tower visible from many points in the city. It has served as the town&#x27;s iconic landmark ever since, and is featured in the city&#x27;s crest and local business logos. As a result, Neely Hill is also referred to as Tower or Clock Tower Hill.

During Reconstruction, the state legislature authorized public schools in 1868 for the first time, and designated some funding to support them. The city established its first public schools. Schools were racially segregated and tended to have short sessions, because of limited funding. In addition, many families depended on their children to work in agriculture and other basic survival work. Freedmen had been granted the franchise and tended to join the Republican Party of President Abraham Lincoln, who had freed them. The abolition of slavery required new labor arrangements to arrange for paid labor.

Due to its riverside location, Rome has occasionally suffered serious flooding. The flood of 1886 inundated the city to such depth that a steamboat traveled down Broad Street. In 1891, upon recommendation of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Georgia State Legislature amended Rome&#x27;s charter to create a commission to oversee the construction of river levees to protect the town against future floods. In the late 1890s, additional flood control measures were instituted, including raising the height of Broad Street by about . As a result, the original entrances and ground-level floors of many of Rome&#x27;s historic buildings became covered over and had to serve as basements.

=== Twentieth century ===

In the early 20th century, the Georgia Assembly approved a charter for the city to establish a commission-manager form of government, a reform idea to add a management professional to the team.

In 1928, the American Chatillon Company began construction of a rayon plant in Rome; it was a joint business effort with the Italian Chatillon Corporation. Italian premier Benito Mussolini sent a block of marble from the ancient Roman Forum, inscribed &quot;From Old Rome to New Rome&quot;, to be used as the cornerstone of the new rayon plant. After the rayon plant was completed in 1929, Mussolini honored the American Rome with a bronze replica of the sculpture of Romulus and Remus nursing from the Capitoline Wolf. The statue was placed in front of City Hall on a base of white marble from Tate, Georgia, with a brass plaque inscribed:

This statue of the Capitoline Wolf, as a forecast of prosperity and glory, has been sent from Ancient Rome to New Rome during the consulship of Benito Mussolini in the year 1929.

In 1940, anti-Italian sentiment due to World War II became so strong that the Rome city commission moved the statue into storage to prevent vandalism. They replaced it with an American flag. In 1952, the city restored the statue to its former location in front of City Hall.

====Great Depression====
In Rome, the effect of the Great Depression was significantly less severe than in other, larger cities across the United States. Since Rome was an agricultural town, food could be grown in surrounding areas. Rome&#x27;s textile mill continued operating, providing steady jobs for whites as a buffer against the economic hardships of the Great Depression.

The Great Depression was preceded by the &quot;Cotton Bust&quot; across the South. This reached Rome in the mid-1920s, and caused many farmers to move away, sell their land, or convert to other agricultural crops, such as corn. Farm workers were displaced, and many African Americans left the area in the Great Migration, seeking work in cities, including those in the North and Midwest. Cotton crops were being destroyed by the boll weevil, a tiny insect that reached Georgia in 1915 (invading from Louisiana). The boll weevil destroyed many fields of cotton and suppressed Rome&#x27;s economy.

Many families struggled through hard financial times. Jobs were scarce, and prices of food and basic commodities went up. The federal &quot;postal employees took a fifteen per cent cut in pay, and volunteered a further ten per cent reduction in work time to save the jobs of substitute employees who otherwise would have been thrown out of work.&quot; Among fundraising activities for the poor, wealthier residents bought tickets to a show put on by local performers; the fares were paid to grocers, who made boxes of food to sell at a discount price to needy families.

In a private &quot;works project&quot; to provide employment to men out of work, S.H. Smith Sr. decided to replace the Armstrong Hotel. After demolishing it, he employed many people to help build the towering Greystone Hotel at the corner of Broad and East Second streets. The &quot;Rome News-Tribune&quot; reported on November 30, 1933, an increase in local building permits for a total of $95,800; of this amount, $85,000 were invested by S.H. Smith Sr. in the construction of the Greystone Hotel. He added the Greystone Apartments in 1936.

== Geography ==
Rome is located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. It is located at the confluence of the Etowah and the Oostanaula rivers, which form the Coosa River. This gave the city access to the waterways, the major transportation routes of the era. Because of this water feature, Rome developed as a regional trade center, based originally on King Cotton. As cotton plantations were developed in the area, Rome was an increasingly important market town, shipping the commodity downriver to other markets. It was designated as the county seat of Floyd County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , or 2.29%, are covered by water.

The seven hills that inspired the name of Rome are known as Blossom, Jackson, Lumpkin, Mount Aventine, Myrtle, Old Shorter, and Neely Hills (the latter is also known as Tower or Clock Tower Hill). Some of the hills have been partially graded since Rome was founded.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year. According to the Köppen climate classification, Rome has a humid subtropical climate, &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Economy==
Rome has long had the strength of economic diversity, with an economy founded in manufacturing, education, healthcare, technology, tourism, and other industries. In 1954, General Electric established a factory to build medium transformers. In the 1960s, Rome contributed to the American effort in the Vietnam War when the Rome Plow Company produced Rome plows, large armored vehicles used by the U.S. military to clear jungles. In the latter part of the 20th century, many carpet mills prospered in the areas surrounding Rome.

Rome is also well known in the region for its medical facilities, particularly Floyd Medical Center, Redmond Regional Medical Center, and Harbin Clinic. Partnering with these facilities for physician development and medical education is the Northwest Georgia Clinical Campus of the Medical College of Georgia, which is part of Georgia Health Sciences University.

==Government==

The city of Rome commission-manager form of government was adopted in 1918. The city&#x27;s charter as approved by the legislature authorized a nine-member City Commission and a five-member Board of Education, to be elected concurrently, on an at-large basis by a plurality of the vote. The city was divided into nine wards, with one city commissioner from each ward to be chosen in the citywide election. There was no residency requirement for Board of Education candidates.

In 1966, after the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) was passed, the city amended its charter with approval by the state legislature, reducing the number of wards from nine to three, with commission members to be elected by at-large voting to numbered positions, three for each ward, with three wards in total. Candidates were required to win by majority vote, with run-off elections between the top two candidates for each seat if no majority emerged after the first round of voting.

From 1964 to 1975, the legislature approved the city&#x27;s 60 acts for annexations, which appropriated mostly areas with white-majority populations.

At the same time, the board of education was increased to six members elected from three wards, with two numbered positions to be elected at-large from the city for each ward, A majority vote was required to win, with runoff procedures to apply to the top two candidates if no majority was achieved. A residency requirement was added for the board members.

This entire proposal was subject to review under the VRA. The city challenged the attorney general&#x27;s authority to reject the annexation and electoral systems for each, as plaintiffs believed the reduction in seats and requirement for majority ranking to win would dilute the voting power of the African-American minority. In 1970, the city had a population of 30,759, with an ethnic composition of 76.6% White and 23.4% Black. Under the state constitution and previous practices making voter registration difficult, African Americans had been essentially disenfranchised since the turn of the 20th century.

In &quot;City of Rome v. United States&quot;, 446 U.S. 156 (1980), the US Supreme Court ruled on the city&#x27;s argument that the attorney general had acted incorrectly in failing to approve the city&#x27;s changes to its election system and its annexations. (The city did not seek pre-clearance of its charter changes to its election system in 1966, nor did it get approval of its 60 annexations from November 1, 1964, to February 10, 1975, which were both required under the law.)

The court upheld the constitutionality of the act, including the prohibition of unintentional discrimination to mitigate the potential that a jurisdiction may engage in intentional discrimination. Because of these findings, the court affirmed the lower court ruling.

In the 2000 census, White Americans made up 63.12% of the population, African Americans made up 27.66% of the city&#x27;s population, and other minorities comprised the remainder. A total of 10.36% of residents identified as Hispanics of any race. The nine-member commission elects a mayor and vice mayor from among its members for specific terms. In addition, the commission hires a city manager for daily operations.

Commission members are elected at-large from three wards of the city; each ward has three seats on the commission. All voters vote for candidates for each position; and candidates may be elected by plurality voting. Members are elected for four-year staggered terms, with commissioners from wards 1 and 3 elected at the same time, and commissioners from ward 2 two years later.

<doc id="110099" wikidata="Q1003686" url="?curid=110099" title="Cumming, Georgia">
<text>Cumming is a city in and the county seat of Forsyth County, Georgia, United States, and the sole incorporated area in the county. It is a suburban city, and part of the Atlanta metropolitan area. In the 2020 census, the population is 7,318, up from 5,430 in 2010. Surrounding unincorporated areas with a Cumming mailing address have a population of approximately 100,000.

== History ==

The area now called Cumming is located west of the historic location of Vann&#x27;s Ferry between Forsyth County and Hall County.

=== Early history ===

The area, now called Cumming, was inhabited earlier by Cherokee tribes, who are thought to have arrived in the mid-18th century. The Cherokee and Creek people developed disputes over hunting land. After two years of fighting, the Cherokee won the land in the Battle of Taliwa. The Creek people were forced to move south of the Chattahoochee River.

The Cherokee coexisted with white settlers until the discovery of gold in Georgia in 1828. Settlers that moved to the area to mine for gold pushed for the removal of the Cherokee. In 1835, the Treaty of New Echota was signed. The treaty stated that the Cherokee Nation must move to the Indian Territory, west of the Mississippi River. This resulted in the Trail of Tears. The Cherokee territory was then formed into Cherokee County in 1831. In 1832, the county had been split into several counties including Forsyth County.

In 1833, the town of Cumming was formed from two land lots that had been issued as part of a Georgia State Land Lottery in 1832. The two lots designated as Land Lot 1269 and Land Lot 1270 were purchased by a couple of Forsyth County Inferior Court justices who realized that it was necessary to have a seat of government to conduct county business. The boundaries of the two lots ended at what is now Tolbert Street on the west side, Eastern Circle on the east side, Resthaven Street on the south side, and School Street on the north side. In 1834 the post office was established and began delivering mail. The justices of the Inferior Court divided the town land into smaller lots and began selling them to people over the next several years, reserving one lot for the county courthouse. During that same year, the Georgia State Legislature incorporated the town of Cumming into the City of Cumming and made it the official government seat of Forsyth County.

A second charter was issued in 1845, decreeing that Cumming&#x27;s government would follow the mayor–council model of government.

The community is commonly thought to be named after Colonel William Cumming. An alternate theory proposed by a local historian posits the name honors Rev. Frederick Cumming, a professor of Jacob Scudder, a resident of the area since 1815 who owned land in present-day downtown. Yet another theory is that the town is named after Alexander Cuming, the son of a Scottish baronet.

=== Modern history ===
During the 1830s and 1840s, Cumming benefited from the gold mining industry as many businesses were created to meet the needs of the miners. However, the California Gold Rush in 1849 put the city into an economic depression. Newly built railroads bypassed the city and took traffic from the Federal Road that ran near Cumming. The city was spared during the Civil War because William T. Sherman did not pass through the city during his March to the Sea. In 1900, the county courthouse was destroyed in a fire after being struck by lightning; it was rebuilt in 1905.

==== 1912 racial conflict of Cumming ====

In 1912, Governor Joseph M. Brown sent four companies of state militia to Cumming to prevent riots after two reported attacks of young white women, allegedly by black men. A suspect in the second assault, in which the victim was also raped and later died, was dragged from the Cumming county jail and lynched. The governor then declared martial law, but the effort did little to stop a month-long barrage of attacks by night riders on the black citizens. This led to the banishment of blacks, and the city had virtually no black population.
Racial tensions were strained again in 1987 when a group of black people were assaulted while camping at a park on Lake Lanier. This was widely reported by local newspapers and in Atlanta. As a result of this, a local businessman decided to hold a &quot;Peace March&quot; the following week. Civil rights leader Reverend Hosea Williams joined the local businessman in a march along Bethelview and Castleberry Road in south Forsyth County into the City of Cumming where they were assaulted by whites. The marchers retreated and vowed to return. During the following &quot;Brotherhood March&quot; on January 24, 1987, another racially mixed group returned to Forsyth County to complete the march the previous group had been unable to finish. March organizers estimated the number at 20,000, while police estimates ran from 12,000 to 14,000. Hosea Williams and former senator Gary Hart were in the demonstration. A group of the National Guard kept the opposition of about 1,000 in check. Oprah Winfrey featured Cumming and Forsyth County on her &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. She formed a town hall meeting where one audience member said:


However, most of the audience members agreed that Forsyth County should integrate. Williams was excluded from Oprah&#x27;s show and arrested for trespassing.

==== City growth ====
Today, the city is experiencing new growth and bears little resemblance to the small rural town it was mere decades ago. The completion of Georgia 400 has helped turn Cumming into a commuter town for metropolitan Atlanta. The city holds the Cumming Country Fair &amp; Festival every October. The Sawnee Mountain Preserve provides views of the city from the top of Sawnee Mountain. In 1956, Buford Dam, along the Chattahoochee River, started operating. The reservoir that it created is called Lake Lanier. The lake, a popular spot for boaters, has generated income from tourists for Cumming as well as provides a source of drinking water.

== Geography ==
Cumming is located in the center of Forsyth County at (34.208464, -84.137575). It is northeast of downtown Atlanta and northeast of Alpharetta.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Cumming has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.58%, is water.

== Demographics ==
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 7,318 people, 2,480 households, and 1,368 families residing in the city.

== Government ==

Cumming is a municipal corporation; since 1845 it has been governed by a mayor and a five-member city council. The mayor and council members serve staggered four-year terms.

On December22, 1834, Cumming was officially incorporated and five councilmen were appointed: John Jolly, William Martin, Daniel McCoy, John H. Russell, and Daniel Smith. The town of Cumming&#x27;s charter was revised on December22, 1845, resulting in new councilmen William F. Foster, Arthur Irwin, Major J. Lewis, Henry L. Sims, and Noah Strong.

House Bill334 was enacted on October10, 1885, giving Cumming a mayor and five-person city council.

Former mayor H. Ford Gravitt was first elected to the city council in 1966, and went on to be elected mayor in 1970. Gravitt was mayor of Cumming for 48 years before losing to rival candidate Troy Brumbalow. Brumbalow has held the office since January 2018 and was re-elected in November 2021.

==History==
The original inhabitants of the area where Carnesville sits in the Piedmont region were the Cherokee and Creek indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands of the United States. Yet, over the years, the indigenous people became indebted to the settlers, which led to the Treaty of Augusta in 1773 and 1783, where they relinquished their claim over the land to the new settlers.
In 1805, the county seat, Carnesville, was laid out and named in honor of Thomas Petters Carnes, a lawyer and politician of the American Revolutionary War era. In 1806, Carnesville was named the permanent county seat in Franklin County, Georgia. Carnesville was incorporated as a town in 1819 and subsequently enlarged to a city in 1901.

Carnesville was thinly settled for a considerable time after being laid out. About 80 people lived in the city at the time of its incorporation. The area around Carnesville had a free population of 9,156 and a slave population of 1,056 by 1810.

== Historical notes ==

===What is in a Name===
Some say Gumlog is an amateur translation of the Indian name &quot;tsilalu hi&quot;, meaning &quot;Sweet-Gum Settlement.&quot; Others say the name comes from the sweet-gum tree logs early settlers used for benches when they held their first court referred to as the Gum Log Court.
===First court in Franklin County===
In 1785, the Yazoo land fraud caused the state of Georgia to surrender its claim on what is now Alabama and Mississippi. South Carolina took advantage of the situation to move the boundary with Georgia from the main branch of the Keowee River to the Tugaloo branch, absorbing some Franklin County territory. Like other Georgia counties at the time, Franklin County had to decide which land claims were legitimate and which were fraudulent. The first county court was held at the home of Warren Philpot on Gumlog Creek. George Walton, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, was the court&#x27;s chief justice. The assistant justices were Jesse Walton, Benjamin Cleveland, Larkin Cleveland, and John Gorham.

<text>Lavonia is a city in Franklin and Hart Counties, Georgia, United States. The population was 2,156 at the 2010 census, up from 1,827 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==

== History ==
The Cherokee people were indigenous to the area in which Lavonia is located. A sophisticated tribe that typically dwelled in cabins by the 18th century, the Cherokee joined with the British during the American Revolution. When the American colonists prevailed, their land was issued as bounty land to those who had fought in the revolution. As a result, European Americans began to move into the Lavonia area during the 1780s.

The founding of the town of Lavonia came as the result of the expansion of the railroad in northeast Georgia. A railroad line known as the Elberton-Airline Railroad desired another station further to the north. In a move typical for the time, businessmen in the area determined to build a town around the new railroad station. Upon division of the area into town lots and completion of all necessary legal procedures, the town of Lavonia was incorporated in 1880. The community was named after Lavonia Hammond Jones, the wife of a railroad official.

<text>Alpharetta is a city in northern Fulton County, Georgia, United States, and part of the Atlanta metropolitan area. As of the 2020 U.S. census, Alpharetta&#x27;s population was 65,818; in 2010, the population had been 57,551.

==History==

In the 1830s, the Cherokee people in Georgia and elsewhere in the South were forcibly relocated to the Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) under the Indian Removal Act. Pioneers and farmers later settled on the newly vacated land, situated along a former Cherokee trail stretching from the North Georgia mountains to the Chattahoochee River.

One of the area&#x27;s first permanent landmarks was the New Prospect Camp Ground (also known as the Methodist Camp Ground), beside a natural spring near what is now downtown Alpharetta. It later served as a trading post for the exchanging of goods among settlers.

Known as the town of Milton through July 1858, the city of Alpharetta was chartered on December 11, 1858, with boundaries extending in a radius from the city courthouse. It served as the county seat of Milton County until 1931, when Milton County merged with Fulton County to avoid bankruptcy during the Great Depression.

The city&#x27;s name may be a variation of a fictional Indian girl, Alfarata, in the 19th-century song &quot;The Blue Juniata&quot;; it may also be derived from alpha, the first letter of the Greek alphabet.

The Simeon and Jane Rucker Log House, built in 1833, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

The inhabitants of the area, primarily Methodists and Baptists, engaged in various occupations such as farming, blacksmithing, milling, merchandising, carpentry, and ditching. A number of them possessed a small number of slaves. Throughout the American Civil War (1861-65), local men participated in combat or served in the home guard; however, Union forces did not advance north of Roswell, which is situated roughly six miles to the southwest.

<text>East Point is a suburban city located southwest of Atlanta in Fulton County, Georgia, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 38,358. The city name is derived from being at the opposite end of the former Atlanta and West Point Railroad from West Point.

==History==
The name &quot;East Point&quot; derives from the fact that this is the terminus of the Atlanta &amp; West Point Railroad in the east; West Point, Georgia, is the terminus where the rail line ends in the west.

This settlement was founded as a railroad terminus with 16 families in 1870, but grew quickly after it became an inviting place for industry to develop. Soon it boasted the railway, two gristmills, and a government distillery located on Connally Drive. One of the earliest buildings was the factory of the White Hickory Manufacturing Company, built by B.M. Blount and L.M. Hill (who became the first chairman of the board of aldermen of the city).

By 1880 the town had two churches, a common school, a steam-cotton gin, a sawmill, a post office (founded in 1851), a telegraph office and its own newspaper weekly, &quot;The Plow Boy.&quot; East Point ranked as a grain and cotton-growing center. With its pleasant upland climate and proximity to the railway, it was a popular summer resort for people from the city of Atlanta.

In 1884 the first telephone rang in East Point, and in 1887 the city received its first charter. In 1890 a major portion of property along East Point Avenue was subdivided and developed, opening the way for more homes, more churches, more people, and more places of employment. By 1892 Main Street was completed, despite protests from a few progress-shy early settlers who maintained that one major thoroughfare, Newnan Road, was more than sufficient.

By the start of the 20th century, the adolescent town was poised to grow into the city it eventually would become.

In late 2015 and early 2016, some scenes for the Netflix series &quot;Stranger Things&quot; were filmed at the exterior of the First Baptist Church (standing in for a hospital exterior in a fictional Indiana town).

The recording studio of Dungeon Family was originally located in East Point, and contributed to the development of Atlanta hip hop.

==Geography==

The per capita income for the city was $15,175.

<text>Fairburn is a city in Fulton County, Georgia, United States, with a population of 16,483, according to the 2020 census. Though it has a rich history of its own, the city is now a closely linked suburb of Atlanta, which lies just 17 miles to the north.

== History ==
Fairburn is located along a railroad line and was the county seat of Campbell County starting in 1871.

The government of Campbell County went bankrupt in 1931 during the Great Depression and, along with Milton County to the north, was absorbed into Fulton County when 1932 began. Fairburn&#x27;s population was 305 in 1870, with 208 white and 97 black residents.

<text>Hapeville, established 1891, is a city in Fulton County, Georgia, United States. The population was 6,553 at the 2020 census, an increase of 180 residents from the 2010 census.

== Etymology ==
Hapeville is named for Dr. Samuel Hape, one of the area&#x27;s original landowners and its first mayor. Dr. Hape and other members of his family are buried in Atlanta&#x27;s Oakland Cemetery.

==History==

During the 1950s and 1960s, Hapeville was a thriving part of the Tri-City (Hapeville, East Point, College Park) area and its post-World War II population supported four elementary schools (Josephine Wells, North Avenue, College Street, and St. John&#x27;s Catholic school) and one high school. During the 40 years following, it became regarded as a somewhat depressed industrial area. Since 2005, Hapeville has seen significant gentrification, beginning with the Virginia Park neighborhood and then spreading throughout the city. Hapeville has been discovered by young professionals seeking historic neighborhoods close to downtown Atlanta, and there has been a great deal of new residential construction, including single-family homes, townhomes, and upscale apartments. This new residential development has led to a revived historic downtown. Hapeville has also been discovered by metro Atlanta&#x27;s arts community, and the beginnings of an artist colony have taken shape with the formation of the Hapeville Arts Alliance. The Hapeville Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

From 1947 until 2006, Hapeville was home to the Ford Atlanta Assembly Plant, recently manufacturing the Taurus. There are development plans to open a multi-use development, Aerotropolis Atlanta, on the site, which is adjacent to Atlanta Airport. 

Hapeville is also home to the Dwarf House - the first Chick-fil-A restaurant which was totally rebuilt and greatly expanded in 2021, the original location&#x27;s 4th incarnation. Hapeville is also home to portions of the Porsche North American Headquarters. While Porsche&#x27;s headquarters building is technically located in Atlanta, its Porsche Classic Cars Restoration Facility, Porsche Service Center, and portions of the Porsche Experience track are all in Hapeville.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 6,553 people, 2,780 households, and 1,078 families residing in the city.

==Economy==
Korean Air Cargo&#x27;s U.S. headquarters are in Hapeville, near the northeast corner of the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.

==Education==
Hapeville is a part of Fulton County Schools. Residents are zoned to Hapeville Elementary School, Paul D. West Middle School in East Point, and Tri-Cities High School in East Point. In addition, Hapeville Charter Middle School is located in Hapeville.

<text>Roswell is a city in northern Fulton County, Georgia, United States. At the official 2020 census, the city had a population of 92,883, making Roswell the state&#x27;s ninth largest city. A suburb of Atlanta, Roswell has an affluent historic district.

==History and government==
In 1830, while on a trip to northern Georgia, Roswell King passed through the area of what is now Roswell and observed the great potential for building a cotton mill along Vickery Creek. Since the land nearby was also good for plantations, he planned to put cotton processing near cotton production.

Toward the middle of the 1830s, King returned to build a mill that would soon become the largest in North Georgia – Roswell Mill. He brought with him 36 enslaved Africans from his own coastal plantation, plus another 42 skilled enslaved carpenters bought in Savannah to build the mills. The enslaved built the mills, infrastructure, houses, mill worker apartments, and supporting buildings for the new town. The enslaved Africans brought their unique Geechee culture, language, and religious traditions from the coast to north Georgia.
King invited investors from the coast to join him at the new location. He was also joined by Barrington King, one of his sons, who succeeded his father in the manufacturing company. Archibald Smith was one of the planters who migrated there to establish a new plantation, also bringing enslaved African Americans from the coastal areas.

Shortly after 1832 a survey of the area was conducted by Nathan Crawford Barnett as part of the Cherokee Purchase in preparation for the sixth state administrated land lottery culminating in the Cherokee removal.

Barrington Hall (the home of Barrington King), Smith Plantation (the home of Archibald Smith) and Bulloch Hall (the childhood home of President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s mother, Mittie Bulloch) have been preserved and restored. They are now open to the public. According to the 1850 Slave Schedules, these three &quot;founding families&quot;, together with the next three largest planters, held 192 slaves, 51% of the total 378 slaves held in Roswell District. Archibald Smith had a cotton plantation. According to the 1850 Census, Barrington King held 70 enslaved Blacks. Half of them were under the age of 10. These enslaved worked in the Barrington&#x27;s household. Barrington King &quot;leased&quot; or &quot;rented&quot; some of his enslaved adult males to the Roswell Manufacturing Company, but they did not work around the mill machinery.

The Roswell area was part of Cobb County when first settled, and the county seat of Marietta was a four-hour (one-way) horseback ride to the west. Since Roswell residents desired a local government, they submitted a city charter for incorporation to the Georgia General Assembly. The charter was approved on February 16, 1854.

By the time of the Civil War, the cotton mills employed more than 400 people, mostly women. Given settlement patterns in the Piedmont region, they were likely of Scots-Irish descent. As the mill increased in production, so did the number of people living in the area.

During the Civil War, the city was captured by Union forces under the leadership of General Kenner Garrard. Under orders of General Sherman, Garrard shipped the mill workers north to prevent them from returning to work if the mills were rebuilt. This was a common tactic of Sherman to economically disrupt the Confederate rebellion. The mill was burned, but the houses were left standing. The ruins of the mill and the dam that was built for power still remain. Most of the town&#x27;s property was confiscated by Union forces. The leading families had left the town to go to safer places well before the Civil War, and arranged for the enslaved people to be taken away from advancing Union troops, as was often the practice. Some slaves may have escaped to freedom beyond Union lines.

After the war, Barrington King rebuilt the mills and resumed production. While many freedmen stayed in the area to work as paid labor on plantations or in town, others migrated to Fulton County and Atlanta for new opportunities. The South suffered an agricultural depression resulting from the effects of the war and the end of slavery in the United States.

According to the census, the population of Cobb County decreased slightly from 14,242 in 1860, to 13,814 in 1870. The proportion of African-Americans decreased more, from 27% to 23%. During those years, nearby Fulton County more than doubled in population, from 14,427 to 33,336. The effects of dramatic African-American migration can be seen by the increase in Fulton County from 20.5% slave in 1860 to 45.7% colored (Black) in 1870.

At the end of 1931, the United States was in the midst of the Great Depression. The difficult economic conditions drove Milton County, Roswell&#x27;s neighboring county to the north (note: much of what is now Roswell was part of Milton County already), to merge in its entirety with Fulton County, Roswell&#x27;s neighboring county to the south. To facilitate the merger, Roswell was ceded from Cobb County to become part of Fulton County. This became effective the 9th day of May in 1932. Roswell filed all legal records, including vital statistics, real estate, and the results of torts with the county clerk of Cobb before this date; with the county clerk of Fulton, after this date.

<text>Sandy Springs is a city in northern Fulton County, Georgia, United States, and a suburb of Atlanta. The city&#x27;s population was 108,080 at the 2020 census, making it Georgia&#x27;s 7th most populous city. It is the site of several corporate headquarters, including UPS, Newell Brands, Inspire Brands, Focus Brands, Cox Enterprises, and Mercedes-Benz USA&#x27;s corporate offices.

==History==
Human settlement in the area can be traced back to approximately 400 CE, when Native Americans forged three trails to better access the area&#x27;s freshwater springs. In the 16th century, the Creek Muskogee tribe settled the area, where they remained until the early 1800s, when they were forced out of the area due to the discovery of gold.

In 1821, the federal government held a number of land lotteries in the area, resulting in the purchase of land in present-day Sandy Springs and its subsequent settlement. The Austin-Johnson House, the oldest existing unaltered house, was built in 1842 on what is now Johnson Ferry Road. In 1851, Wilson Spruill donated of land for the founding of Sandy Springs United Methodist Church, near the natural spring for which the city is named. In 1905, the Hammond School was built at Johnson Ferry Road and Mt. Vernon Highway, across the street from the church.

=== 20th century ===

In 1950, the state legislature blocked Atlanta from annexing the community, which remained rural until the Interstate Highway System was authorized by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956. In 1959, after a fire at Hammond Elementary School, William Hartsfield, the mayor of Atlanta, urged residents to support annexation so that the area would have better firefighting protection. Community opposition killed the proposal. In the early 1960s, Georgia 400 and Interstate 285 were constructed, connecting Sandy Springs to metro Atlanta and initiating a housing boom that brought new residents and major land development as part of the white flight from Atlanta after the Civil Rights Movement won greater racial integration within Atlanta.

In 1965, Hartsfield once again proposed the annexation of the Sandy Springs area. Spokesmen for Sandy Springs promised residents to &quot;build up a city separate from Atlanta and your Negroes and forbid any Negroes to buy, or own, or live within our limits&quot; should they reject annexation. In 1966, annexation by Atlanta was defeated in a referendum, with two-thirds voting against.

Efforts to incorporate Sandy Springs began in 1966 in response to attempts by the city of Atlanta to annex this unincorporated area of north Fulton County.

In the early 1970s, the city of Atlanta attempted to use a state law to force annexation of Sandy Springs, which failed after the Supreme Court of Georgia ruled that the law was unconstitutional. In response, a group of residents formed the Committee for Sandy Springs 1975 to lobby for the incorporation of Sandy Springs.

During this time, proponents for an incorporated Sandy Springs argued that their taxes were disproportionately going to other, largely non-white, communities in Fulton County. In every legislative session, state legislators representing the area introduced a bill in the Georgia General Assembly to authorize a referendum on incorporation. Legislators representing Atlanta and southwestern Fulton County, who feared that tax revenue would be lost from incorporation, blocked the bills, using the procedural requirement that all local legislation be approved first by a delegation of representatives from the affected area.

In 1991, the Georgia state government determined that Sandy Springs, along with other wealthier, and predominantly white, communities in Fulton County was being taxed below statewide minimums, resulting in an increase in taxes for the area. Some Sandy Springs residents, including Mitch Skandalakis, launched a number of campaigns against the taxes, and launched an unsuccessful lawsuit against the state.

On January 16, 1997, Eric Rudolph bombed an abortion clinic in Sandy Springs.

=== 21st century ===
When the Republican Party gained a majority in both houses of the Georgia General Assembly in 2005, the procedural rules previously used to prevent a vote by the full chamber were changed so that the bill was handled as a state bill and not as a local bill. The assembly also repealed the requirement that new cities must be at least from existing cities that had stymied previous attempts to incorporate due to Sandy Springs directly bordering both Roswell and Atlanta. The bill allowing for a referendum on incorporation was introduced and passed as HB 37. The referendum initiative was approved by the Assembly and signed by Governor Sonny Perdue.

A referendum was held on June 21, 2005, and residents voted 94% in favor of incorporation. In November 2005, voters returned to the polls to elect a mayor and six city council members.

Formal incorporation occurred on December 1, making Sandy Springs the third-largest city ever to incorporate in the U.S. The city&#x27;s police force and fire department began service in 2006. Upon incorporation, Sandy Springs initiated a nontraditional approach by operating as a public-private partnership (PPP), with all but six full-time employees being contracted.

In 2010, the city undertook a procurement process to rebid all general city services, which was won by CH2M Hill. The timing of this contract, during the Great Recession, allowed the city to leverage a cheaper contract due to the economic downturn.

In 2010, the city became the first jurisdiction in Georgia to successfully &quot;bail out&quot; from the preclearance requirements of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.

In 2019, the Sandy Springs City Council moved to scale back the PPP model, directly hiring 183 contract employees, leaving only 15 outsourced full-time workers by the end of 2019. The city will still outsource a number of services, including the city attorney&#x27;s office, as well as security, street sweeping and ambulance services. The move was expected to save $2.7 million in the next year and more than $14 million over 5 years.

==Geography==
The boundaries of Sandy Springs are Atlanta to the south, Cobb County (at the Chattahoochee River) to the west and north, Roswell (also at the river) to the north, and Dunwoody and Brookhaven, at the DeKalb County line, to the east. A small panhandle in the northeast extends between the Chattahoochee River to the north and Dunwoody to the south, ending in a very small border with Peachtree Corners in the extreme western edge of Gwinnett County.

===Climate===
Sandy Springs has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). During January and February 2014, the Atlanta area, including Sandy Springs, experienced a severe snow storm and a severe ice storm, both of which left much of the region without power, caused major travel disruptions, and the former storm forced people to take shelter in cars and schools as the city was underprepared for the black ice that prevented transport.

===Neighborhoods===

==== Downtown—City Springs====
City Springs, the downtown district of Sandy Springs, is usually defined as the area to the south and east of Sandy Springs Circle, to the north of Interstate 285, and to the west of Boylston Drive. It is located approximately 12 miles directly north of Downtown Atlanta. In the absence of a traditional downtown, city leaders created City Springs, a multi-use development containing municipal offices, residential, retail, green space and a performing arts center, landmarking a formal &quot;downtown&quot; for its residents. City leaders purchased the property in 2008, which was once the site of a former Target (formerly Richway) shopping center, located between Roswell Road, Johnson Ferry Road, and Mount Vernon Highway. Since then, the surrounding area in the district has become a center for urban renewal for the city, with many new mixed-use apartment developments being planned or built, primarily replacing old strip malls along Roswell Road. The City Springs center officially opened in 2018, 10 years after the original site purchase. The official address for the complex is on Galambos Way, named after the city&#x27;s first mayor, Eva Galambos. Within the City Springs district is Heritage Green, which is home to the spring which spurred the name of the city.

==== Riverside ====
Riverside is the western district of the city, located south of Dalyrmple Road and west of Roswell Road, bordering the Chattahoochee River to the west, forming the western border with Cobb County. It is a high-income, residential area marked by winding, hilly roads and old growth forest. The main roads are Heards Ferry Road and Riverside Drive, and it is located off the Riverside Drive exit of I-285. Two of the public schools within Sandy Springs are located here, Heards Ferry Elementary and Riverwood International Charter School. The headquarters for the Fulton County Board of Education are also found in this district. Many of the neighborhoods in this area derive their name from the river.

==== The Panhandle ====
The Dunwoody Panhandle, or just &quot;The Panhandle&quot; is a residential area bounded by the Dunwoody city limit to the south, the Chattahoochee River to the north, Georgia 400 to the west, and Peachtree Corners city limit to the east. The district&#x27;s name is derived from the fact that it is wedged between the river and Dunwoody, forming a geographic panhandle. Major roads include Dunwoody Club Drive and Spalding Drive, and Interstate access is through the Northridge Road exit of Georgia 400. Many who lived in the neighborhood during Sandy Springs&#x27; incorporation considered themselves part of Dunwoody, and voiced their opposition to the installment of street sign toppers labelled &quot;Sandy Springs&quot;. Then-mayor Eva Galambos stated that these new signs would do nothing to diminish the neighborhood&#x27;s identity. Some residents still consider the area to be &quot;Dunwoody in Sandy Springs&quot;, similar to the Buckhead Community district of Atlanta.

==== Perimeter Center ====
Perimeter Center is a commercial edge city and business district surrounding Perimeter Mall. Although about 40% of Perimeter Center, including the mall, is located in Dunwoody, the western 60%, including most of the area&#x27;s office towers, are located in Sandy Springs. Pill Hill is located in the Sandy Springs section of Perimeter Center, and is the largest medical center in Georgia. It includes Northside Hospital, St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital, and Children&#x27;s Healthcare of Atlanta. More than 40% of the hospital beds in the metro area are located within Sandy Springs. Landmarks include Hammond Park, Concourse at Landmark Center, colloquially called the &#x27;King&#x27; and &#x27;Queen&#x27; buildings due to their distinct white crown architecture at the top of each tower, as well as two MARTA stations, the Sandy Springs and Medical Center MARTA stations. The area also includes the 400-285 highway interchange, which is currently undergoing major construction. The top three tallest suburban buildings in the country are found here, the &#x27;King&#x27; and &#x27;Queen&#x27;, and nearby Park Towers at #3.

==== North Springs ====
North Springs is located in the northern portion of the city, and is generally defined as the area west of the Dunwoody/DeKalb County border, east of Brandon Mill Road, north of Abernathy Road, and south of Dalrymple Road and Spalding Drive. The North Springs MARTA station, the terminus of the MARTA Red Line, serves the district. Five of Sandy Springs&#x27; public schools are in this area, including the newest Ison Springs Elementary School, Woodland Elementary School, Spalding Drive Charter Elementary School, Sandy Springs Charter Middle School, and North Springs Charter High School.

==== South Springs—Sandy Springs ITP ====
South Springs or Sandy Springs ITP, an acronym for &quot;inside the perimeter&quot;, refers to a portion of the city which extends south of Interstate 285, colloquially referred to as &quot;the perimeter&quot;. It is located north of the City of Atlanta border, east of the Riverside district, south of Interstate 285, and west of the Brookhaven/DeKalb County border. The southern area of this district is considered to be a part of the greater Chastain Park community of Buckhead. The public schools in this area include Ridgeview Charter School and High Point Elementary School. The popular Atlanta radio station 99X broadcasts on 98.9 from here.

==== Powers Ferry Landing ====
The business district just east of the river crossing is called Powers Ferry Landing, located where Northside Drive crosses the road, just east of the former landing. This provides freeway access at Northside Drive (west ramps) and New Northside Drive (east ramps, road and ramps built in a 1990s reconstruction). Signage on the freeway indicates Powers Ferry Road, Northside Drive, and New Northside Drive.

====North End====
The North End is a large district in the northernmost portion of the city, and is generally defined as the area to the west of GA400, to the south and east of the Chattahoochee River, and to the north of Dalrymple Road. It is accessible via GA400 at Northridge Road, and contains the Northridge business area and the North River Village community. The Huntcliff community is located west of the district, on a panhandle to the northwest.

===Services===
Sandy Springs was noted for contracting private companies to perform the majority of its services in a public-private partnership model of government at the beginning of its incorporation in 2005. While many governments contract with private-sector companies on a per-project basis, Sandy Springs is believed to be the first American city to outsource its services for the majority of ongoing operations. They chose to do so as an economic response to the Great Recession. The city regularly hosted delegations from other governments that were interested in the model. Services not outsourced include police, fire-rescue, and city management. The city moved away from the private-public partnership model in 2019 when it was realized how much money was lost to private contractors and hired 184 full-time city staff that work at the new City Springs development. It now operates as a hybrid model, outsourcing projects to private companies as needed. The city estimates $14 million will be saved over the next five years from hiring full-time staff.

A new city hall opened in 2018.

<text>Ellijay, occasionally spelled Elijay, is a city in Gilmer County, Georgia, United States. Its population was 1,862 at the 2020 census. The city is the county seat of Gilmer County.

Agriculture is important in Gilmer County, known as the &quot;Apple Capital of Georgia.&quot; The city holds an annual Georgia Apple Festival in October.

Former President Jimmy Carter owned a pine-cabin second home in Ellijay. Other tourists are attracted to the mountains and whitewater kayaking.

==History==
This area was long settled by cultures of indigenous peoples. It was known as part of the historic homeland of the Cherokee people until the US government&#x27;s policy of ethnic cleansing of Native Americans from the Southern States saw them forcibly displaced to Oklahoma in 1838. They had a village here, at the confluence of the Ellijay and Cartecay Rivers, which together form the Coosawattee River. About 4,000 Cherokees died in the ensuing trek to Oklahoma.

Ellijay (sometimes formerly spelled &quot;Elejoy&quot;) is the anglicized form or transliteration of the Cherokee name &quot;Elatseyi&quot;, meaning &quot;new ground&quot;. Other sources say it means &quot;green place&quot;.

Gilmer County was organized by territory cut from Cherokee County in 1832, and Ellijay was designated as its county seat in 1834. It was a fairly isolated and remote mountain community until the late 19th century. After the Marietta and Northern Georgia Railroad (later the Louisville and Nashville Railroad) was constructed through here in 1884, the railroad stimulated a boom in the timber industry by providing a profitable way to get lumber to markets. Many timber companies came into the area with their workers.

More than a century later, another major transportation improvement was construction of the Zell Miller Mountain Parkway (Georgia 515, named for Georgia governor and U.S. Senator Zell Miller), which was completed in 1991.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. It is situated at the confluence of the Ellijay and Cartecay Rivers, which together form the Coosawattee River. The Coosawattee flows west as part of the Oostanaula/Coosa/Alabama River watershed. The county seat is bordered to the east and south by the city of East Ellijay.

=== Climate ===
Ellijay lies within the Humid subtropical climate zone along with the majority of the rest of the Southeastern United States. The highest elevations in the surrounding region reside in the oceanic climate. Ellijay enjoys cool winters and warm summers, but neither would be considered extreme due to its slightly higher elevation than other areas in the south. Winter snowfall is common, but generally on the lighter side. A few exceptions exist, one being the 1993 Storm of the Century, which dropped 17 inches of snow in Ellijay. Summers are warm, though mild for southern standards, with temperatures topping out in the mid 80s during the summer. Rain is evenly distributed throughout the year, averaging 57.97 inches per year, as reported from the nearest NOAA reporting station in Jasper, Georgia.

<text>Brunswick ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Glynn County in the U.S. state of Georgia. As the primary urban and economic center of the lower southeast portion of Georgia, it is the second-largest urban area on the Georgia coastline after Savannah and contains the Brunswick Old Town Historic District. At the 2020 U.S. census, the population of the city proper was 15,210; the Brunswick metropolitan area&#x27;s population as of 2020 was 113,495.

Established as &quot;Brunswick&quot; after the German Duchy of Brunswick–Lüneburg, the ancestral home of the House of Hanover, the municipal community was incorporated as a city in 1856. Throughout its history, Brunswick has served as an important port city; in World War II, for example, it served as a strategic military location with an operational base for escort blimps and a shipbuilding facility for the U.S. Maritime Commission. Since then, its port has served numerous economic purposes.

Brunswick supports a progressive economy largely based on tourism and logistics, with a metropolitan GDP of $3.9 billion as of 2013. The Port of Brunswick, one of Georgia&#x27;s two seaports, handles approximately 10 percent of all U.S. roll-on/roll-off trade—third in the U.S., behind the ports of Los Angeles and Newark. The headquarters of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is located north of the central business district of the city and is adjacent to Brunswick Golden Isles Airport, which provides commercial air service to the area.

Brunswick is located on a harbor of the Atlantic Ocean, approximately north of Florida and south of South Carolina. Brunswick is bordered on the west by Oglethorpe Bay, the East River, and the Turtle River. It is bordered on the south by the Brunswick River and on the east by the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway in the Mackay River, which separates it from the Golden Isles.

==History==
The Mocama, a Timucua-speaking people, lived in and cultivated the lands in what is now Brunswick. The Spanish established missions in Timucuan villages beginning in 1568. During this time, much of the Native American population was depleted through enslavement and disease. When the Province of Carolina was founded in 1663, the British claimed all lands south to the 31st parallel north, but little colonization occurred south of the Altamaha River as the Spanish also claimed this land. Three years after the Province of Georgia was founded at Savannah in 1733, James Oglethorpe had the town of Frederica built on St. Simons Island, challenging Spaniards who laid claim to the island. The Spanish were driven out of the province after British victories in the battles of Bloody Marsh and Gully Hole Creek in 1742; it was not until the Treaty of Paris of 1763 that Spain&#x27;s threat to the province was formally ended, when all lands north of the St. Marys River and south of the Savannah River were designated as Georgia.
The area&#x27;s first European settler, Mark Carr, arrived in 1738. Carr, a Scotsman, was a captain in Oglethorpe&#x27;s Marine Boat Company. Upon landing, he established his tobacco plantation, which he called &quot;Plug Point&quot;, along the East and Brunswick rivers. The Province of Georgia purchased Carr&#x27;s fields in 1771 and laid out the town of Brunswick in the grid plan akin to that of Savannah, with large, public squares at given intervals. The town was named for the duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg in Germany, the ancestral home of George III and the House of Hanover. Brunswick was a rectangular tract of land consisting of . The first lot was granted on June 30, 1772; 179 lots were granted in the first three years. However, at Iabout this time Brunswick lost most of its citizens, many of whom were Loyalists, to East Florida, the Caribbean Basin, and the United Kingdom for protection during the American Revolutionary War. From 1783 to 1788 a number of these lots were regranted and there collected in Brunswick a few families who desired proper education for their children. By the act of the General Assembly on February 1, 1788, eight town commissioners were appointed and Glynn Academy was chartered, the funding of which was to come from the sales of town lots. Brunswick was recognized as an official port of entry in 1789 by an act of the United States Congress. In 1797 the General Assembly transferred the seat of Glynn County from Frederica to Brunswick.

At the end of the eighteenth century, a large tract of land surrounding Brunswick on three sides had been laid off and designated as Commons. Commissioners were named in 1796 to support these efforts. The General Assembly authorized them to sell of Commons, one-half of the proceeds to go to the construction of the courthouse and jail and one-half to the support of the academy. In 1819 the commissioners erected a suitable building for school purposes on the southeastern corner of Reynolds and L streets. This was the first public building in Brunswick. It was abandoned four years later, but a new building was erected on Hillsborough Square in 1840 using Commons proceeds. A courthouse and jail were built around this time.

The town was officially incorporated as a city on February 22, 1856. It was at this time that state representative Jacob Moore in conjunction with others conspired to control the Commons, and any proceeds that might be had from sales. Moore managed to persuade the Georgia General Assembly to pass legislation giving him control over significant amounts of local real estate. This precipitated a period of strife, pitting the powerful interests, headed by Rep. Moore, against the common citizenry. It was into this turmoil that Carey Wentworth Styles appeared, in 1857, when he moved his family to Brunswick from Edgefield, South Carolina. Styles, an attorney, was attracted to the area by news of the civil strife. As one observer later wrote, the citizens of Brunswick were in &quot;need of a defender&quot;.

Styles quickly became embroiled in the dispute, siding with the citizenry. He announced his intention to run for mayor, and organized a mass protest rally for the evening of December 24. In spite of bad weather, a crowd gathered at the protest point, where Styles delivered an impassioned speech against the powerful interests, and the legislative act giving them the power to seize local property. Styles called the legislation &quot;dishonorable&quot;, at which point Moore (the bill&#x27;s sponsor and beneficiary) jumped to his feet and shouted at Styles, calling the accusation a &quot;falsehood&quot;. In the official testimony on file in the Glynn County courthouse, Styles is said to have yelled back at Moore, saying &quot;You are a damned liar!&quot;, to which Moore replied &quot;You are a damneder liar!&quot;. Gunfire ensued, resulting in the death of Moore. Witness accounts had Moore firing first, and though Styles was subsequently arrested for manslaughter, the charges were eventually dropped. On March 1, 1858, Styles was elected mayor of Brunswick. Some years later, Styles moved to Atlanta, where he founded &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot;. In November 1879, nineteen years after he left, Styles returned to Brunswick, where he established the local weekly &quot;Seaport Appeal&quot;. When that eventually failed, Styles moved to Texas, never to see Brunswick again.

By 1860 Brunswick had a population of 468, a bank, a weekly newspaper, and a sawmill which employed nine workers.

Brunswick was abandoned during the American Civil War when citizens were ordered to evacuate. The city, like many others in the South, suffered from post-war depression. After one of the nation&#x27;s largest lumber mills began operation on nearby St. Simons Island, economic prosperity returned. Rail lines were constructed from Brunswick to inland Georgia, which stimulated a sawmill boom, said to average one mill every two miles, along with the new industrial corridor. In his book &quot;The New South Comes to Wiregrass Georgia, 1860–1910&quot; author Mark V. Wetherington states that from Eastman, former Quartermaster General Ira R. Foster &quot;shipped lumber to Brunswick, where it was loaded onto timber schooners and transported to international markets like Liverpool, Rio de Janeiro, and Havana.&quot; Unlike many other southern cities during the Reconstruction period, Brunswick experienced an economic boom.

In 1878, poet and native Georgian Sidney Lanier, who sought relief from tuberculosis in Brunswick&#x27;s climate, wrote &quot;The Marshes of Glynn&quot;, a poem based on the salt marshes that span Glynn County. The December 1888 issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; predicted that &quot;Brunswick by the Sea&quot; was destined to become the &quot;winter Newport of America&quot;. Jekyll Island had become a resort destination for some of the era&#x27;s most influential families (most notably Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, Pulitzers, and Goodyears) who arrived by train or yacht.

A yellow fever epidemic began in 1893, which heralded a decade of hardships for the city; it was flooded in 1893 when a modern-day Category 3 hurricane (today known as the Sea Islands Hurricane) paralleled the coast of Georgia before hitting South Carolina. The storm left the city under of water. A Category 4 hurricane hit Cumberland Island just south of Brunswick in October 1898, which caused a storm surge in the city. As a result, 179 were killed.

Construction of an electric streetcar line began in 1909 and was completed in 1911. Tracks were located in the center of several city streets. In July 1924, the F.J. Torras Causeway, the roadway between Brunswick and St. Simons Island, was completed, and passenger boat service from Brunswick to St. Simons Island was terminated. By 1926, the electric streetcar line in Brunswick was discontinued; the decline of the streetcar systems coincided with the rise of the automobile.

In World War II, Brunswick served as a strategic military location. German U-boats threatened the coast of the southern United States, and blimps became a common sight as they patrolled the coastal areas. During the war, blimps from Brunswick&#x27;s Naval Air Station Glynco (at the time, the largest blimp base in the world) safely escorted almost 100,000 ships without a single vessel lost to enemy submarines.

In World War II, Brunswick boomed as over 16,000 workers of the J.A. Jones Construction Company produced ninety-nine Liberty ships and &quot;Knot&quot; ships (type C1-M ships) which were designed for short coastal runs, and most often named for knots for the U.S. Maritime Commission to transport materiel to the European and Pacific theatres.

The first ship was the SS &quot;James M. Wayne&quot; (named after James Moore Wayne), whose keel was laid on July 6, 1942, and which was launched on March 13, 1943. The last ship was the SS &quot;Coastal Ranger&quot;, whose keel was laid on June 7, 1945, and which was launched on August 25, 1945. The first six ships took 305 to 331 days each to complete, but soon production ramped up and most of the remaining ships were built in about two months, bringing the average down to 89 days each. By November 1943, about four ships were launched per month. The SS &quot;William F. Jerman&quot; was completed in only 34 days in November and December 1944. Six ships could be under construction in slipways at one time.

On February 23, 2020, Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, was murdered during a racially motivated hate crime while jogging in Satilla Shores, a neighborhood near Brunswick in Glynn County, Georgia.

== Geography ==

The city of Brunswick is located in southeastern Georgia, approximately halfway between Jacksonville, Florida and Savannah. The city is located at the apex of the Georgia Bight, the westernmost point on the Atlantic seaboard, and is naturally sheltered by two barrier islands, Jekyll and St. Simons. The city is situated on a peninsula with the East River and the Turtle River to the west, the Brunswick River to the south, and the Mackay River with the Intracoastal Waterway to the east. An abundance of salt marshes separates the city from the Intracoastal Waterway, which passes between Brunswick and the barrier islands. The East River separates Brunswick from Andrews Island, a dredge spoil site.

The city is the lowest in the U.S. state of Georgia, with an elevation of only above sea level. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Brunswick&#x27;s land area is . Its total area is ; of this is water.

=== Climate ===
Brunswick&#x27;s climate is classified as humid subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot; in the Köppen climate classification system). During the summer months, it is common for the temperature to reach over . However, the humidity results in a heat index higher than the actual temperature. Summer mornings average nearly 90 percent humidity and nearly 60 percent in the afternoon. Scattered afternoon thunderstorms are common in the summer. The hottest temperature ever recorded in Brunswick was in 1986. Winters in Brunswick are fairly temperate. The average high in January, the coldest month, is , while the average low is . Snowfall is very rare. The last snow accumulation in Brunswick was on January 22, 2025.

Brunswick receives a high amount of rainfall annually, averaging about . The wettest months are August and September, the peak of hurricane season. The city has suffered less damage from hurricanes than most other East Coast cities. A major hurricane has not made landfall on the Georgia coast since 1898, and the only hurricane that has hit the coast since then was Hurricane David in 1979. However, the city has experienced hurricane or near-hurricane conditions several times due to storms passing through Florida from the Gulf of Mexico and entering Georgia or passing to the north or south in the Atlantic and brushing the area.

=== Environment ===
The Brunswick area has four Superfund sites, formerly home to heavily contaminated toxic waste sites: the LCP Chemicals site, Brunswick Wood Preserving, the Hercules 009 Landfill, and the Terry Creek Dredge Spoil Areas/Hercules Outfall. Research published in 2011 revealed that bottlenose dolphins that fed in the estuaries near these Superfund sites had the highest concentration of PCBs of any mammal in the world.

Renovated in the early 1980s and again in 2000 through 2001, the Ritz is home to the Golden Isles Arts and Humanities Association, the coordinating arts council for Brunswick and Glynn County. The association hosts an annual performing arts series and rents space to individual producers and organizations.

The city is home to various art galleries. Art Downtown is a cultural arts center featuring a fine art gallery, studio, and production company. It is home to the Brunswick Actors&#x27; Theatre. The Gallery on Newcastle is home to a display of scenes from coastal Georgia&#x27;s marshes.

Along Union Street is a collection of 19th and early 20th-century Victorian mansions. Each December the Magnolia Garden Club tours select Union Street homes in addition to other areas in historic Brunswick as part of its Christmas Tour of Homes.

=== Cuisine ===

The city lays claim to Brunswick stew, a tomato-based stew containing various types of lima beans, corn, okra, and other vegetables, and one or more types of meat. Most recipes claiming authenticity call for squirrel or rabbit meat, but chicken, pork, and beef are also common ingredients. A twenty-five-gallon (95 L) iron pot outside the city bears a plaque declaring the stew was first cooked there in 1898. The Brunswick Rockin&#x27; Stewbilee, held annually in October, features a stew-tasting contest where visitors sample over 50 teams&#x27; stews. The Stewbilee became famous when the city invited Brunswick County, Virginia, to the festival for a stew cookoff in the 1980s, which led the Brunswick &quot;Stew Wars&quot; to be featured in &quot;Southern Living&quot;.

Brunswick is the center of Georgia&#x27;s shrimping industry. The city was once called &quot;The Shrimp Capital of the World&quot;, but in recent times, production has been far below average. Nevertheless, nearby Jekyll Island hosts the Wild Georgia Shrimp &amp; Grits Festival in September. Apart from shrimping, the area is also the center of Georgia&#x27;s crab and oyster industries.

== Sports ==
The College of Coastal Georgia has an active collegiate sports program. The local high schools compete in the Georgia High School Association&#x27;s quad-A Region 2 sporting events. From 1950 to 2007, Brunswick served host to the Golden Isles Bowl Classic, one of the most prestigious junior college football bowl games in the country. Scholastic and intramural sports are held at school and park facilities around the city. Glynn County Stadium and Lanier Field are two sports stadiums available in the city.

Golden Isles Speedway, a race track, is located in western Glynn County, approximately west of the city.

The PGA Tour holds the RSM Classic every year at the Seaside Course on Sea Island. The area is famous for its golf resorts. In 2008 Sea Island was ranked the number-one destination for business meetings and golf by &quot;Golf Digest&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot;. Sea Island was also ranked number-one among the best golf resorts in North America by &quot;Golf Digest&quot;. There are three golf courses located just north of the city, and combined with Jekyll, St. Simons, and Sea islands, there are 252 holes of golf in the Brunswick area.

The Brunswick area is home to two out of three publicly accessible beaches in the state. Brunswick is the gateway city to Jekyll and St. Simons islands; both are accessible via automobile only by causeways from the city. The islands, known colloquially as the Golden Isles, feature white-sand public beaches and are popular destinations for tourists and local citizens.

In 1906 the city was home to a Class D-level minor league baseball team, the River Snipes, a team shared with Columbus as part of the inaugural season of the Georgia State League. The league went defunct following that season. In 1913 the Brunswick Pilots debuted as part of the short-lived Empire State League, before joining the Georgia State League in 1914, and the Florida–Alabama–Georgia League in 1915. The Pilots stopped play following the 1915 season. Thirty-six years passed before Brunswick had another professional baseball team. In 1951 the Brunswick Pirates, a Class D minor league affiliate of the major league Pittsburgh Pirates, began to play in the Georgia–Florida League, beginning eight years of presence in the city. The Pirates won league championships in 1954 and 1955. In 1957 the Pirates became affiliates of the Philadelphia Phillies, respectively adopting the name Brunswick Phillies. Following the 1958 season, the Phillies ceased to play. Brunswick was home to the Cardinals of the Georgia–Florida League in 1962 and 1963 before the league disbanded in 1963.

== Parks and recreation ==

The Brunswick Parks and Recreation Department operates city parks and squares. Six city squares were part of Brunswick&#x27;s original 1771 Town Plan. The two largest central squares were Wright and Hanover. Though half of Wright Square was built on by a middle school in the 1950s, the square was recently returned to its original size with George Street removed through the middle. Five of the six still exist today, with Hillsboro Square converted into the campus of Glynn Academy High School. There are also two additional squares located within the city, Orange, and Palmetto. Numerous parks exist in the city, the largest being Howard Coffin Park. The parks include features such as playgrounds, baseball fields, softball fields, soccer fields, basketball courts, and picnic areas. Coffin Park includes a walking track. The district also owns the Roosevelt Lawrence Community Center, a center equipped with popular and traditional recreational game tables, two classrooms, and a multi-purpose gymnasium.

The Brunswick area is rich in live oak trees, particularly the Southern live oak. Such is the quality of the live oak trees in the Brunswick and the Golden Isles area that Revolutionary warships such as the (nicknamed &quot;Old Ironsides&quot;) were clad in St. Simons Island oak planks. Brunswick has a notable live oak named Lover&#x27;s Oak (located at Prince and Albany streets). As of 2005, it is approximately 900 years old. According to the State of Georgia and American Indian folklore, Native American braves and their maidens would meet under the oak. Another notable oak, Lanier&#x27;s Oak, is notable as being the location where poet Sidney Lanier, on one of his visits to Brunswick, was inspired to write &quot;The Marshes of Glynn&quot;.

Blythe Island Regional Park is located on Blythe Island within the city.

== Government ==
Brunswick uses the council-manager model of municipal government. The city commission consists of five individuals, including the mayor, elected on a plurality-at-large basis. Commissioners constitute the legislative body of the city and, as a group, are responsible for taxation, appropriations, ordinances, and other general functions. The mayor of Brunswick is Cosby Johnson, who was elected in 2021 and is the second African-American mayor of Brunswick. Johnson is also the first Millennial Mayor of Brunswick.

The city is divided into two wards with each ward electing two city commission representatives. The mayor serves as an at-large commissioner and chairperson. The commission meets twice each month at Old City Hall in Old Town. The city commission appoints a city manager to serve at will for an infinite term. The main duty of the manager is to implement policy set by the city commission and manage the operations of the city on a daily basis. The city manager is to see that all laws, provisions of the city charter, and any acts of the city commission are executed and enforced. The city manager of Brunswick is Regina McDuffie.

In November 2008, Mayor Thompson and the city commission of Brunswick traveled to Ganzhou to strengthen ties between the two cities. Ganzhou, a city with a population of 8.5 million, reciprocated, sending a delegation to Brunswick where an official sister city agreement was signed at Old Brunswick City Hall on April 3, 2009.

== Education ==

=== Higher education ===

Brunswick is home to the College of Coastal Georgia, which has more than 3,000 enrolled students. Since 1961, the college had been a two-year institution, but in 2008, the college began its transition to a four-year institution. The college is currently a state college within the University System of Georgia, with bachelor&#x27;s degree programs in education, business, and nursing sciences, and other associate degree programs designed to prepare students to transfer to senior colleges and universities.

=== Primary and secondary schools ===
The Glynn County School System is the governing authority of public schools in the city. More than 12,000 students attend schools in the school system. There are ten elementary schools, four middle schools, and two high schools: Brunswick High School and Glynn Academy. Glynn Academy, the second-oldest public high school in the American South and the sixth-oldest public high school in the United States, was founded in 1788 by an act of the Georgia General Assembly. Brunswick High School opened in 1967. Specialized institutions include a career-technical academy.

There are several private schools operating in the area. In the city, there is one Catholic school and one Seventh-day Adventist school. There are also Baptist, Pentecostal, and non-denominational Christian schools north of the city, such as Heritage Christian Academy. On St. Simons Island, there is a Presbyterian school. Several smaller Christian schools in Brunswick offer high school education.

== Media ==

&quot;The Brunswick News&quot; is one of two major daily newspapers serving Brunswick; the other is &quot;The Georgia Times-Union&quot;, a subsidiary of the Jacksonville-based &quot;Florida Times-Union&quot;. Brunswick has one free weekly newspaper delivered to most homes in Glynn County, &quot;The Harbor Sound&quot; (a free publication). &quot;The Islander&quot; is a weekly paper, member of the Georgia Press Association, and available at newsstands or by subscription.

The major AM radio stations in Brunswick are WSFN 790, an ESPN affiliate and primarily a sports station; WGIG 1440; and WBGA 1490, which are all news and talk stations.

WPXC-TV, channel 21, an Ion affiliate, is the only broadcast television station in Brunswick. The station became an ABC affiliate in 1996, but in 2001, Allbritton Communications sold the station and, therefore, the station lost its affiliation. All major U.S. television networks are represented in Brunswick from Jacksonville and Savannah-based television stations.

== In popular culture ==
Brunswick has been featured in scenes from the films &quot;The View from Pompey&#x27;s Head&quot; (1955), &quot;Conrack&quot; (1974), &quot;The Longest Yard&quot; (1974), and the documentary &quot;Criminalizing Dissent&quot; (2006).

The city is also the setting for the novel &quot;Ravens&quot; by author George Dawes Green.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Transportation ===
Brunswick Golden Isles Airport (BQK, KBQK) is served by Delta Air Lines, with several daily round trips to the Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The city was formerly served by DayJet, with service to cities in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia; the company suspended its operations in September 2008.

Two railway lines run through the city: CSX and Norfolk Southern. The Golden Isles Terminal Railroad is a short line operating of mainline trackage between Anguilla Junction and the Colonel&#x27;s Island and Marine Port terminals of the Port of Brunswick. This line connects with a line that originates in Old Town Brunswick at Anguilla Junction. Brunswick last had direct passenger service in 1966 or 1967 with the unnamed successor to the Southern Railway&#x27;s &quot;Kansas City-Florida Special.&quot; Amtrak passenger service is available in Jesup, northwest of the city.

The original Sidney Lanier Bridge was a vertical-lift bridge on U.S. 17 crossing the Brunswick River and was opened on June 22, 1956. On November 7, 1972, the ship &quot;African Neptune&quot; struck the bridge, causing parts of the bridge to collapse, taking cars with it. The accident resulted in ten deaths. On May 3, 1987, the bridge was again struck by a ship, the Polish freighter &quot;Ziemia Bialostocka&quot;. A new cable-stayed bridge with the same name opened in 2003 to allow larger ships to enter the port and to eliminate the need for the drawbridge on U.S. 17. It is the longest-spanning bridge in Georgia. The elevation at the top of the support towers is .

Three federal highways pass through Brunswick: U.S. Route 17, U.S. Route 341, and U.S. Route 25. U.S. 17 runs north to south through the eastern part of town and is a four-lane highway. U.S. 341 overlaps U.S. 25 for almost the entire route and originates in Brunswick off U.S. 17. Interstate 95 runs west and northwest of the city, and U.S. Route 82 originates at the junction of U.S. 17 and State Route 303 just west of I-95.

In 2006, Glynn County applied for approximately $930,000 for first-year funding for a transit service. The county and city match was for over $100,000 combined. The first-year project would fund the purchase of up to four buses, two vans, signage, equipment, and facility improvements. As of 2007 the first-year application was pending with the Georgia DOT and the Federal Transit Administration.
