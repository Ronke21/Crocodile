<text>The 1994 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XVII Olympic Winter Games (; ) and commonly known as Lillehammer &#x27;94, were an international winter multi-sport event held from 12 to 27 February 1994 in and around Lillehammer, Norway. Having lost the bid for the 1992 Winter Olympics to Albertville in France, Lillehammer was awarded the 1994 Winter Games on 15 September 1988, two days before the 1988 Summer Olympics opening ceremonies at the 94th IOC Session in Seoul, South Korea. Due to the calendar changes made in 1986, this was the only time that the Winter Olympics took place two years after the previous Winter Games, and the first to be held in a different year from the Summer Olympics. This was also the first Winter Olympics to be held during the Commonwealth Games and FIFA World Cup year. This was the second Olympic Games of any type hosted in Norway — the first being the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo — and the fourth Olympics overall to be held in a Nordic country, after the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden, and the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland. Lillehammer is the northernmost city ever to host the Olympic Games.

Although Lillehammer was the main host city, some events were held in neighboring cities and counties, and the speed skating events were held in Hamar, some ice hockey matches were played in Gjøvik, and the Alpine skiing events were held in Øyer and Ringebu areas. Sixty-seven National Olympic Committees and 1,737 athletes participated in six sports and sixty-one events. Fourteen countries made their 
Olympic debuts, of which nine were former Soviet republics. The Games also saw the introduction of stricter and more rigid qualifying rules, reducing the number of under-performing participants. Six new events were introduced into the Olympic programme: new distances in short-track speed skating and aerials, and speed skating events were held indoors. Almost two million people spectated at the Games, which were the first to have the Olympic Truce in effect. The Olympics were followed by the 1994 Winter Paralympics from 10 to 19 March.

Manuela Di Centa and Lyubov Yegorova dominated women&#x27;s cross-country skiing, taking five and four medals for Italy and Russia respectively. A crowd of more than 100,000 saw Italy beat Norway by 0.4 seconds in the men&#x27;s 4 × 10 km relay. Vreni Schneider won a complete set of medals for Switzerland in Alpine skiing, while Norway took a podium sweep in the men&#x27;s combined competition. In ladies&#x27; singles figure skating, 16-year-old Ukrainian Oksana Baiul won gold, narrowly defeating Nancy Kerrigan, who won silver; this was the first Ukrainian medal at the Olympics in their first independent appearance. Johann Olav Koss won three speed skating golds for Norway, while 13-year-old Kim Yun-mi from South Korea became the youngest-ever Olympic gold medalist. Sweden defeated Canada in a dramatic penalty shootout in the ice hockey final. Russia topped the medal table, winning 11 gold medals, while Norway collected the highest number of medals overall, with 26. The event also gained notoriety for the assault of Nancy Kerrigan.

==Host city selection==

The idea for an Olympic bid for Norway was born in 1981, when Falun in neighbouring Sweden was defeated by Calgary in Canada to host the 1988 Winter Olympics. Along with the Norwegian government, the bid was also publicly encouraged and supported by the Swedish government, largely to help stimulate the economy of their inland counties. Lillehammer originally bid for the 1992 Games but came fourth in the voting, with the Games ultimately awarded to Albertville, France. In 1986, at the 91st IOC Session in Lausanne, the IOC announced the intent to separate the Summer and Winter editions (which had been held in the same year since the inception of the Winter Olympics in 1924) after the 1992 Games. The two editions of the Olympics had alternated every two years during the four-year cycle. Lillehammer subsequently launched another bid, now for the 1994 Games, with some drastic modifications of the project, such as a new indoor speed skating venue and an additional ice hall in Lillehammer. Supplementary government guarantees and funds were secured for the new bid.

Three other locations put in bids for the 1994 Games: Anchorage (United States), Östersund (Sweden), and Sofia (Bulgaria). Lillehammer was elected to host the 1994 Winter Games at the 94th IOC Session, held in Seoul on 15 September 1988, two days before the start of the 1988 Summer Olympics. Until 2018, the Lillehammer Games were the last Winter Olympics to be held in a town, rather than centered in a city.

==Organization==

The overall responsibility for the games was held by the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee, which was created on 14 November 1988 and led by Gerhard Heiberg. Between 1989 and 1993, the committee was reorganized several times with various subsidiaries. On 11 February 1993, it became a joint venture owned 51% by Lillehammer Municipality (as main stakeholder), 24.5% by the Government of Norway, and 24.5% by the Norwegian Olympic Committee. This model was also used for the Lillehammer Paralympic Organizing Committee. The Norwegian government had issued a guarantee for the Games and also covered the expenses related to infrastructure. The total cost of the Games was 7.4 billion Norwegian krone (NOK), of which NOK 0.95 billion was expended by the ministries, NOK 4.48 billion was for operations and event expenses, and NOK 1.67 billion was for investments. The Games had a revenue of NOK 2.71 billion, of which NOK 1.43 billion was from television rights, NOK 0.65 billion was from sponsors, and NOK 0.15 billion was from ticket sales.

Production and execution of the broadcasting, which cost NOK 462 million, was a joint venture of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK), the CTV (Canada) (CTV), and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) (the NRK is part of the collaboration of EBU members).
 NRK and EBU had 1,424 people working at the Olympics, while international broadcasters sent an additional 4,050 accredited broadcasting personnel. The transmission rights for the games were held by EBU in Europe, CBS in the United States, NHK in Japan, CTV in Canada, the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union, Nine Network in Australia, as well as other broadcasters in other countries. The total transmission rights price was 350 million United States dollars, 310 million of which were paid only by CBS. This value was attributed in part to the Harding–Kerrigan affair. As of 2010, the viewership in the United States was still the highest ever for the Winter Olympics.

NOK 460 million was used on information technology, with the main system running on an IBM AS/400. 3,500 media terminals were in use during the games based on the Info &#x27;94 system; it was the first Winter Olympics to have terminals installed abroad. Seiko delivered the time-keeping devices. Telecommunications were delivered by Telenor, including signal transmission. This included a mobile radio network with nine base stations.

==Cost and cost overrun==
&quot;The Oxford Olympics Study&quot; established the outturn cost of the Lillehammer 1994 Winter Olympics at US$2.2 billion in 2015-dollars and cost overrun at 277% in real terms. This includes sports-related costs only, that is, (i) &quot;operational costs&quot; incurred by the organizing committee for the purpose of staging the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) &quot;direct capital costs&quot; incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build, e.g., the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which are required to host the Games. Indirect capital costs are &quot;not&quot; included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, or for hotel upgrades or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The cost and cost overrun for Lillehammer 1994 compares with costs of US$2.5 billion and a cost overrun of 13% for Vancouver 2010, and costs of US$51 billion and a cost overrun of 289% for Sochi 2014, the latter being the most costly Olympics to date. Average cost for Winter Games since 1960 is US$3.1 billion, average cost overrun is 142%.

==Events==

There were 61 events contested in 6 sports (12 disciplines).
===Opening ceremony===

As the 1988 Winter Games, the Organizing Committee decided not to build a specific Olympic Stadium for the opening and closing ceremonies and opted to conduct them at the ski jumping hill, Lysgårdsbakken. Artistic content presented a range of Norwegian and Nordic cultures, including elements such as Sami joik, Telemark skiing, fiddlers and folk dancing, simulations of Norwegian traditional events, such as wedding processions, and the figure of vetter from Norse mythology. After speeches by Heiberg and IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, the Games were officially declared opened by King Harald V. and the Olympic Anthem was performed by the lyrical singer, Sissel Kyrkjebø. After, the Olympic Flame was to be carried down the ski jump before lighting the cauldron. Originally this task had rested upon Ole Gunnar Fidjestøl, but after he broke an arm in a practice jump, his back-up, Stein Gruben, received the honor. The cauldron was lit by Crown Prince Haakon Magnus. The Olympic oaths were taken by Vegard Ulvang for the athletes and Kari Kåring for the officials.

===Alpine skiing===

Since the 1992 Games, the rules for combined changed, where the winner was determined by total time instead of points. The women&#x27;s downhill was originally scheduled for Hafjell, but after protests due the hill difficulties it was moved to Kvitfjell, which also hosted the men&#x27;s downhill and super-G. In the men&#x27;s events, Germany&#x27;s Markus Wasmeier won two disciplines, giant slalom and super-G, finishing ahead of the United States&#x27;s Tommy Moe on the super-G. Moe won the downhill ahead of Norway&#x27;s Kjetil André Aamodt, who came in third in the super-G. Austria&#x27;s Thomas Stangassinger won the slalom ahead of Italy&#x27;s Alberto Tomba. In the combined, Norway took a medal sweep, with Lasse Kjus winning ahead of Aamodt and Harald Christian Strand Nilsen.

In the women&#x27;s events, Switzerland&#x27;s Vreni Schneider was the most successful, winning the slalom, taking silver in combined and taking bronze in giant slalom. The only other athlete to take multiple medals was Italy&#x27;s Isolde Kostner, who took a third place in both downhill and super-G. The downhill was won by Germany&#x27;s Katja Seizinger, super-G by the United States&#x27; Diann Roffe, the giant slalom by Italy&#x27;s Deborah Compagnoni, and the combined by Sweden&#x27;s Pernilla Wiberg.

===Biathlon===
Russia and Germany split all the individual men&#x27;s medals. In the 10 km sprint, Russia&#x27;s Sergei Tchepikov won ahead of Ricco Groß, both with a clean sheet. Bronze winner Sergei Tarasov won the 20 km individual ahead of Germany&#x27;s Frank Luck and Sven Fischer. Germany easily revenged itself by winning the 4 × 7.5 km relay ahead of Russia and France. In the women&#x27;s class, Canada&#x27;s Myriam Bédard won both the individual events, finishing ahead of Belarus&#x27; Svetlana Paramygina on the 7.5 km sprint and ahead of France&#x27;s Anne Briand on the 15 km individual. In the 4 × 7.5 km relay, the format since 1992 was changed from three to four participants. Russia, with a clean sheet, won ahead of Germany, who made six misses, with France taking the bronze.

===Bobsleigh===
In two-man, Switzerland took the top two places, with Gustav Weder, Donat Acklin winning 0.05 seconds ahead of Reto Götschi and Guido Acklin, who were again 0.15 seconds ahead of Italy&#x27;s Günther Huber and Stefano Ticci placing third. In four-man, Germany-II, consisting of Harald Czudaj, Karsten Brannasch, Olaf Hampel and Alexander Szelig, finished 0.06 seconds ahead of Switzerland-I and 0.23 ahead of Germany-I.

===Cross-country skiing===

Participants from five countries took all the medals of the ten events. Starting in 1994, the Olympics alternated which of the medium-distance and long-distance races had classical and freestyle. men&#x27;s 4 × 10 km relay was watched by a crowd of nearly 150,000. Norway, Italy and Finland followed each other tightly for three and a half rounds, with the second and third exchange of the three talking place within 1.1 seconds of each other. Finland fell behind in the end, and Norwegian Bjørn Dæhlie and Italian Silvio Fauner battled to the end, with Italy beating Norway by 0.4 seconds. Dæhlie won the 10 km classical and 15 km freestyle pursuit, while taking silver in the 30 km freestyle. Kazakhstan&#x27;s Vladimir Smirnov won the 50 km classical, in addition to silver in the 10 km and the 15 km. Norway&#x27;s Thomas Alsgaard won the 30 km, while Finland&#x27;s Mika Myllylä took an individual silver and a bronze.

Italy&#x27;s Manuela Di Centa and Russia&#x27;s Lyubov Yegorova dominated the women&#x27;s events. They took five and four medals each, respectively, and between them winning all the races. Yegorova finished ahead of Di Centa on the 5 km classical and the 10 km pursuit, while Di Centa finished ahead of Yegorova on the 15 km freestyle, and also won the 30 km classical ahead of Norway&#x27;s Marit Wold. Finland&#x27;s Marja-Liisa Kirvesniemi took two bronze medals, in 5 km and 30 km. In the 4 × 5 km relay, Norway and Russia kept up with each other until the final stage, in which Anita Moen lost to Yegorova, with Italy finishing third. With Yegorova&#x27;s sixth career gold, she was tied as the most-winning Winter Olympic participant.

===Figure skating===

On 6 January, Tonya Harding&#x27;s ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly and his friend Shawn Eckardt, conspired with Shane Stant to club fellow female figure skater Nancy Kerrigan in the knee. Both Harding and Kerrigan were selected for the Olympic team. After Harding admitted to helping to cover up the attack, the United States Olympic Committee initiated proceedings to remove her from the Olympic team, but Harding retained her place after threatening legal action. In the ladies&#x27; singles, Ukraine&#x27;s Oksana Baiul narrowly won ahead of Kerrigan and Chen Lu, with Harding finishing eighth. In the men&#x27;s singles, Russia&#x27;s Alexei Urmanov won ahead of Canada&#x27;s Elvis Stojko and France&#x27;s Philippe Candeloro. Relaxation of the rules led to several former stars returning, such as ice dancing 1984 Champions Great Britain&#x27;s Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, who took a bronze behind Russians Oksana Grishuk and Evgeny Platov, and Maya Usova and Alexander Zhulin. In pair skating, the Russians also took a double, with Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov winning ahead of Natalia Mishkutenok and Artur Dmitriev.

===Freestyle skiing===

Aerials was added as a discipline, after it had been a demonstration sport at the previous two games. Ski ballet, which had been a demonstration sport in 1992, was dropped. Canada dominated the men&#x27;s events, with Jean-Luc Brassard winning the men&#x27;s moguls ahead of Russian Sergey Shupletsov. In the men&#x27;s aerials, Switzerlands&#x27;s Andreas Schönbächler won ahead of Canada&#x27;s Philippe LaRoche and Lloyd Langlois, with Canadians also claiming the fourth and sixth places. In the women&#x27;s disciplines, Norway was the only nation to take two medals; Stine Lise Hattestad won the moguls ahead of the United States&#x27; Liz McIntyre. In the aerials, Lina Cheryazova won, claiming Uzbekistan&#x27;s only medal, ahead of Sweden&#x27;s Marie Lindgren and Norway&#x27;s Hilde Synnøve Lid.

===Ice hockey===
Twelve teams participated in the ice hockey tournament, divided into two groups. Each played as a single round robin, with the four best advancing to the single elimination medal tournament. Group A saw Finland win all five matches, while the host nation lost all theirs. Also Germany, the Czech Republic and Russia advanced from the group, all with three victories. Group B was won by Slovakia ahead of Canada, Sweden and the United States. The quarter-finals saw the Czech Republic, the United States, Germany and Slovakia eliminated. In the semi-finals, Canada beat Finland 5–3, while Sweden beat Russia 4–3. After the final period of the final, the match was a 2–2 tie, resulting in a shoot-out. After six shots, it was tied 2–2 until Sweden&#x27;s Peter Forsberg beat Corey Hirsch, making the Swedes win after Paul Kariya missed his shot. This led to Tomas Jonsson, Håkan Loob and Mats Näslund becoming the first three members of the Triple Gold Club.

===Luge===
Italy, Germany and Austria collected all the medals in the luge events. Germany&#x27;s Georg Hackl won the men&#x27;s singles, making him the first to defend an Olympic title in the event in thirty years. He finished ahead of Austria&#x27;s Markus Prock and Italy&#x27;s Armin Zöggeler. In the doubles, the two Italian teams finished on top, with Kurt Brugger and Wilfried Huber winning ahead of Hansjörg Raffl and Norbert Huber. In the women&#x27;s singles, Italy&#x27;s Gerda Weissensteiner won ahead of Germany&#x27;s Susi Erdmann and Austria&#x27;s Andrea Tagwerker. The own debuts was start Nedžad Lomigora from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Marco Feder from Liechtenstein, Sminon J. Payne from Bermuda, Paul Hix from United Kingdom, Josef Svarek from Slovakia, Roger White from Australia.

===Nordic combined===
Although the events were the same, since the 1992 Games there was a rule change so that instead of jumping three times and taking the points for the best two, the competitors only jumped twice. In the individual normal hill/15 km, Japan&#x27;s Kenji Ogiwara had only lost a single event in the season&#x27;s World Cup, but came in sixth on the hill, which was won by Norway&#x27;s Fred Børre Lundberg. He won the event after finishing eight-best in the skiing, ahead of Japan&#x27;s Takanori Kono, Norway&#x27;s Bjarte Engen Vik and Ogiwara in fourth. In the team normal hill/3 x 10 km, Japan finished first, third and fifth among the jumpers, giving them a 5:07 minute lead over Norway and finishing 4:49 minutes ahead. Switzerland took the bronze.

===Short track speed skating===
Short track speed skating was dominated by South Korea, who won four of the six events. After the discipline&#x27;s debut in 1992, 1994 featured two new events, the men&#x27;s 500 meters and the women&#x27;s 1000 meters. South Korea&#x27;s Chae Ji-Hoon won the men&#x27;s 500 meters, while taking silver on the 1000 meters behind countryman Kim Ki-Hoon, who defended his 1992 gold. The bronze was won by Canada&#x27;s Marc Gagnon, who won the B final. In the A final, countryman Derrick Campbell was obstructed by Great Britain&#x27;s Nicky Gooch, who was disqualified. Campbell got up and started celebrating his bronze medal, when he discovered he had not completed the race.

In the men&#x27;s 5000 meter relay, South Korea did not enter after a fall in the sole qualifying event, which took place in March 1993. Canada fell during the final, which saw Italy take a clear victory ahead of the United States, who were marginally ahead of Australia. The United States&#x27; Eric Flaim became the first to take Olympic medals in both short track and long track speed skating, while Australia took its first Winter Olympic medal ever. Six people took the individual medals in the women&#x27;s events, with the United States&#x27; Cathy Turner defending her 1992 gold on the 500 meters and South Korea&#x27;s Chun Lee-Kyung taking the gold in 1000 meters. South Korea won the 3000 meter relay with a team of four girls under 19. At 13, Kim Yoon-Mi became the world&#x27;s youngest Olympic gold medalist.

===Ski jumping===

Norway won three of the six individual medals, with Norway&#x27;s Espen Bredesen winning the normal hill ahead of Norway&#x27;s Lasse Ottesen and Germany&#x27;s Dieter Thoma. In the large hill, Germany&#x27;s Jens Weißflog won ahead of Bredesen and Austria&#x27;s Andreas Goldberger. In the
large hill team, the 1994 Games introduced new rules whereby all four jumps in each round counted, and not just the best three. Neither Norway nor Finland, who between them had won all but one former Olympic team jump, managed to collect a medal. The event became a duel between Germany and Japan, with only a point separating them after the first round of jumps. Masahiko Harada had the last jump, and would secure a gold if he managed 105 meters but lost his &#x27;cool&#x27; mistiming his leap and landed at 97.5 meters, giving the gold to the Germans.

===Speed skating===
In 1989, the International Skating Union mandated that, from the 1994 Olympics onwards, speed skating events would be held indoors to avoid interference from wind and weather conditions in the competitions. The 1994 Games also introduced a new system of qualification rules, limiting the number of participants in the men&#x27;s 5000 meters and women&#x27;s 3000 meters to 32, and only allowing the 16 best in each of these events to participate in the men&#x27;s 10000 meters and the women&#x27;s 5000 meters.

Norway&#x27;s Johann Olav Koss took three golds, in the men&#x27;s 1,500 meters, 5000 meters and 10000 meters. In the latter two, he finished ahead of fellow countryman Kjell Storelid. The men&#x27;s 500 meters was won by Russia&#x27;s Aleksandr Golubev ahead of fellow countryman Sergey Klevchenya, while the men&#x27;s 1000 meters was won by American Dan Jansen. For women, American Bonnie Blair defended her two 1992 golds in 500 meters and 1000 meters. Austria&#x27;s Emese Hunyady won the 1500 meters ahead of Russia&#x27;s Svetlana Bazhanova and Germany&#x27;s Gunda Niemann. However, Bazhanova took gold ahead of Nemeth-Hunyady on the 3000 meters, with Germany&#x27;s Claudia Pechstein in third. Pechstein would go on to win the 5000 meters ahead of Niemann.

===Closing ceremony===

At the closing ceremonies, also held at Lysgårdsbakken, all spectators were handed a flashlight with the inscription &quot;Remember Sarajevo&quot;—the host of the 1984 Winter Olympics which was at worst moment of the Bosnian War, the Siege of Sarajevo. The first entrants on the stage were Liv Ullmann and Thor Heyerdahl, followed by the athletes&#x27; precession. After the Olympic flag had been transferred to Nagano mayor Tasuka Tsukada, speeches were held by Lillehammer mayor Audun Tron, Heiberg and Samaranch. The latter used his speech to remind about Sarajevo&#x27;s situation, before giving Heiberg IOC&#x27;s gold medal. Artistic presentations followed with many of the themes from the opening ceremony.At the 15-minute presentation as the next host city, Nagano was presented to world as a modern Yama-uba, also the 1998 Winter Olympics mascots, the Snowlets, was also presented on a public eye for the first time. Of the 2,200 people performing in the opening and closing ceremonies, only 50 were professionals.

==Venues==

The games were spread out over ten venues in five municipalities in two counties, Oppland and Hedmark. Lillehammer, with 25,000 inhabitants, and Hamar and Gjøvik, both with 27,000 inhabitants, are all situated on the lake Mjøsa. Gjøvik and Hamar are located south of Lillehammer. Hunderfossen is located north of Lillehammer, but lies within the municipality. Øyer and Ringebu, both with just under 5,000 inhabitants, are located north of Lillehammer, in the valley Gudbrandsdalen. Lillehammer had four venues, Hamar had two venues, while Hunderfossen, Gjøvik, Øyer and Ringebu had one venue each.

In Lillehammer, Lysgårdsbakken features twin ski jumping hills. The large hill has a hill size of 138 and a critical point of 120, while the normal hill has a hill size of 100 and a critical point of 90. The hill has capacity for 35,000 spectators and hosted, in addition to the ski jumping events, the opening and closing ceremonies. Birkebeineren Skistadion featured cross-country skiing and biathlon, with the stadium itself having a capacity for 31,000 spectators during cross-country skiing and 13,500 during biathlon. In addition, spectators could watch from along the tracks. Kanthugen Freestyle Arena featured a capacity for 15,000 spectators. All the outdoor skiing arenas had free areas, which saw up to 25,000 extra spectators at the team jump and 75,000 extra spectators at the 50 km.

Lillehammer Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track is located at Hunderfossen. It had a capacity for 10,000 spectators and is the only bobsleigh and luge track in the Nordic countries. Ice hockey was played at two venues, in Håkons Hall in Lillehammer and Gjøvik Olympic Cavern Hall in Gjøvik. Håkons Hall has a capacity for 10,500 spectators, and also features the Norwegian Olympic Museum. The Cavern Hall is built as a man-made cave and had a capacity for 5,300 spectators. Skating events took place at two venues in Hamar. Vikingskipet had a capacity for 10,600 spectators and featured speed skating events, while figure skating and short-track speed skating were held at Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre. Alpine skiing was split between two ski resorts: Hafjell in Øyer and Kvitfjell in Ringebu. The former was used for the slalom and giant slalom, while the latter hosted downhill and super-G.

Spectators relied heavily on the use of buses and trains for transportation. Downtown Lillehammer and the axis between Lillehammer and Oslo were the most limiting areas, and the Norwegian State Railways ran up to 22 trains per day between Oslo and Lillehammer. Trains were also used northwards towards Trondheim, while other areas were served by bus. All the venues were located along railway lines, making use of spectators walking from the stations to the venues to limit road congestion, although special services were available for disabled people. Shuttle buses were established between venues and also connected to park and ride facilities.

==Participating National Olympic Committees==

A record 67 nations participated in the 1994 Winter Olympics. These Games were the first to implement stricter qualifying standards that prevented low-performing athletes from competing without meeting minimum requirements. As a consequence, eleven &quot;warm-weather countries&quot; that signed up to take part in the Games were mostly absent because very few of their athletes succeeded in qualifying; the number of African athletes fell from nineteen in 1992 to three in 1994. These rules were, however, not applied to bobsled events, enabling the U.S. Virgin Islands, Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica to compete in that sport. On 25 October 1993, the United Nations General Assembly urged its members to observe the Olympic truce, lasting from seven days before the start of the Games until seven days after the close, making the Lillehammer Olympics the first to observe the truce. The IOC appealed for a truce in the ongoing Bosnian War and the Siege of Sarajevo, the city that had hosted the 1984 Winter Olympics.

The former Soviet republics of Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Ukraine and Uzbekistan participated as independent nations. This was the first time since the 1912 Summer Olympics that Russia competed independently at the Olympic Games. Athletes of these countries previously competed in the Winter Olympics as part of the Soviet Union team until 1991. The Czech Republic and Slovakia participated for the first time, after the break-up of Czechoslovakia in 1993. Bosnia and Herzegovina made their Olympic debut, following their independence from Yugoslavia in 1992; the composition of their four-man bob team was one Croat, two Bosniaks and a Serb, mirroring the ethnic diversity of the country. This was also Israel&#x27;s first appearance at the Winter Olympics and a member of the European Olympic Committees. American Samoa participated for the first time, as did Trinidad and Tobago.

<text>&quot;Hadda be Playin&#x27; on the Jukebox&quot; is a poem written by Allen Ginsberg in 1975. .

== Background ==
Many of the themes of &quot;Hadda be Playin&#x27; on the Jukebox&quot; were recurring in Ginsberg&#x27;s poetry. Police violence, student revolt and corporations, for example, had been previously touched on in his 1974 &quot;Thoughts on a Breath&quot;, and conspiracies surrounding the state security apparatus would be explored in 1980, in &quot;Birdbrain!&quot;. That same year, in &quot;Capitol Air&quot;, he would compare America&#x27;s Attica with Russia&#x27;s &quot;Lubyanka wall&quot;. Ginsberg&#x27;s own view on both his political poems and the events they describe was occasionally critical. In &quot;Indian Journals&quot;, he wrote &quot;I shouldn&#x27;t waste my time on America like this. It may be patriotic / but it isn&#x27;t good art&quot;.

== Subject and style ==
The poem frames various events of the 1960s and 1970s, including the Kennedy assassination and the Kent State massacre, as part of a larger trend. Ginsberg refers to the Cold War as &quot;&quot;gang wars across oceans&quot;, and calls capitalism a &quot;vortex of this rage&quot; and a competition &quot;man to man&quot;.&quot;

One of Ginsberg&#x27;s &quot;spontaneous&quot; poems, it has a &quot;long-breathed rolling rhythm&quot;, with an emphasis on hard, single facts presented one at a time over an ever-increasing energy. The poem reflects, too, says Paul Berman, Ginsberg&#x27;s sense of &quot;impotence&quot; at being unable to change—or even convey—the &quot;hypocrisy and criminality&quot; he saw in American foreign policy and domestic politics. Hilton Kramer posits that although a motif of conspiracy runs through the poem, Ginsberg is not actually supporting such a view of history as factual; rather, he is demonstrating &quot;what runaway paranoia looks like&quot; 

The reiterated phrase &quot;Hadda be...&quot; is heard at the beginning of every line, giving each line rhythm, It has been taken to indicate a sense of futility by Ginsberg, in that there was nothing anyone could have done to have prevented the litany of outrages he described, and yet which remorselessly occurred. Possibly, suggests Berman, it is also indicating Ginsberg&#x27;s sorrow: &quot;as if he were saying, &#x27;Why did it have to be you, America, that these things happened to?&#x27;&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
Willard Spiegelman has described &quot;Hadda be Playin&#x27; on the Jukebox&quot; as a rap poem utilising what appears to be &quot;an improvised set of variations&quot;. The poem, says Spiegelman, begins relatively neutrally but becomes increasingly political: &quot;a denunciation of organised crime and its connections to national politics&quot;.

Ginsberg&#x27;s technique is to comment with ever-increasing belligerence regarding events of ever-increasing significance.

It concludes with a critical note referencing the United States&#x27; role on the world stage, and ends in a &quot;final vision of international mayhem&quot;.

== Publication and reworking ==

=== Publication ===
&quot;Hadda Be Playin&#x27; On The Jukebox&quot; was first published in 1978 as part of &quot;Mind Breaths&quot;. This was a collection of poetry Ginsberg had written between 1972 and 1977. It was number 35 in the City Lights &quot;Pocket Poets&quot; series.

=== Reworking ===
It has been performed live, with accompanying music, by the rap metal band Rage Against the Machine, appearing on their album &quot;Live &amp; Rare&quot;, originally a Japan-only release in 1998.

<doc id="113221" wikidata="Q627655" url="?curid=113221" title="Large-group awareness training">
<text>The term large-group awareness training (LGAT) refers to activities—usually offered by groups with links to the human potential movement—which claim to increase self-awareness and to bring about desirable transformations in individuals&#x27; personal lives.
LGATs are unconventional; they often take place over several days, and may compromise participants&#x27; mental wellbeing.

LGAT programs may involve several hundred people at a time.
Though early definitions cited LGATs as featuring unusually long durations, more recent texts describe trainings lasting from a few hours to a few days.

Forsyth and Corazzini cite Lieberman (1994) as suggesting &quot;that at least 1.3 million Americans have taken part in LGAT sessions&quot;.

==Definitions of LGAT==
In 2005 Rubinstein compared large-group awareness training to certain principles of cognitive therapy, such as the idea that people can change their lives by reinterpreting the way they view external circumstances.

In the 1997 collection of essays &quot;Consumer Research: Postcards from the edge&quot;, discussing behavioral and economic studies, the authors contrast the &quot;enclosed locations&quot; used in Large Group Awareness Trainings with the relatively open environment of a &quot;variety store&quot;.

The &quot;Handbook of Group Psychotherapy&quot; (1994) characterised LGAT as focusing on &quot;philosophical, psychological and ethical issues&quot; relating &quot;to personal effectiveness, decision-making, personal responsibility, and commitment.&quot;

Psychologist Dennis Coon&#x27;s textbook, &quot;Psychology: A Journey&quot;, defines the LGAT as referring to programs claiming &quot;to increase self-awareness and facilitate constructive personal change&quot;. Coon further defines Large Group Awareness Training in his book &quot;Introduction to Psychology&quot;. Coon and Mitterer emphasize the commercial nature of several LGAT organizations.

==The evolution of LGAT providers==

Lou Kilzer, writing in &quot;The Rocky Mountain News&quot;, identified Leadership Dynamics (in operation 1967–1973) as &quot;the first of the genre psychologists call &#x27;large group awareness training&#x27;&quot;.
Leadership Dynamics directly or indirectly influenced several permutations of large-group transformation trainings. Werner Erhard (successively associated with Erhard Seminars Training (est or EST), WE&amp;A and Landmark Education) trained as an instructor with Mind Dynamics.
Michael Langone notes that Erhard Seminars Training (est) became in the popular mind the archetype for LGATs.

While working for Holiday Magic, Lifespring founder John Hanley attended a course at Leadership Dynamics.
Chris Mathe, at the time a PhD candidate in clinical psychology, wrote that most of the current commercial forms of Large Group Awareness Training were modeled after the Leadership Dynamics Institute.

==Academic analyses, studies==
&quot;Large Group Awareness Training&quot;, a 1982 peer-reviewed article published in &quot;Annual Review of Psychology&quot;, sought to summarize literature on the subject of LGATs and to examine their efficacy and their relationship with more standard psychology. This academic article describes and analyzes large group awareness training as influenced by the work of humanistic psychologists such as Carl Rogers, Abraham Maslow and Rollo May.

LGATs as commercial trainings took many techniques from encounter groups. They existed alongside but &quot;outside the domains of academic psychology or psychiatry. Their measure of performance was consumer satisfaction and formal research was seldom pursued.&quot;

The article describes an &quot;est&quot; training, and discusses the literature on the testimony of &quot;est&quot; graduates. It notes minor changes on psychological tests after the training and mentions anecdotal reports of psychiatric casualties among est trainees. The article considers how est compares to more standard psychotherapy techniques such as behavior therapy, group and existential psychotherapy before concluding with a call for &quot;objective and rigorous research&quot; and stating that unknown variables might have accounted for some of the positive accounts. Psychologists advised borderline or psychotic patients not to participate.

Psychological factors cited by academics include emotional &quot;flooding&quot;, catharsis, universality (identification with others), the instillation of hope, identification and what Sartre called &quot;uncontested authorship&quot;.

In 1989 researchers from the University of Connecticut received the &quot;National Consultants to Management Award&quot; from the American Psychological Association for their study: &quot;Evaluating a Large Group Awareness Training&quot;.

Psychologist Chris Mathe has written in the interests of consumer-protection, encouraging potential attendees of LGATs to discuss such trainings with any current therapist or counselor, to examine the principles underlying the program, and to determine pre-screening methods, the training of facilitators, the full cost of the training and of any suggested follow-up care.
One study noted the many difficulties in evaluating LGATs, from proponents&#x27; explicit rejection of certain study models to difficulty in establishing a rigorous control group. In some cases, organizations under study have partially funded research into themselves.

Not all professional researchers view LGATs favorably. Researchers such as psychologist Philip Cushman, for example, found that the program he studied &quot;consists of a pre-meditated attack on the self&quot;. A 1983 study on Lifespring found that &quot;although participants often experience a heightened sense of well-being as a consequence of the training, the phenomenon is essentially pathological&quot;, meaning that, in the program studied, &quot;the training systematically undermines ego functioning and promotes regression to the extent that reality testing is significantly impaired&quot;. Lieberman&#x27;s 1987 study, funded partially by Lifespring, noted that 5 out of a sample of 289 participants experienced &quot;stress reactions&quot; including one &quot;transitory psychotic episode&quot;. He commented: &quot;Whether [these five] would have experienced such stress under other conditions cannot be answered. The clinical evidence, however, is that the reactions were directly attributable to the large group awareness training.&quot;

In 2003 the Vatican reported its study results about New Age training courses:

In Coon&#x27;s psychology textbook (&quot;Introduction to Psychology&quot;) the author references many other studies, which postulate that many of the &quot;claimed benefits&quot; of Large Group Awareness Training actually take the form of &quot;a kind of therapy placebo effect&quot;.

Jarvis described Large Group Awareness Training as &quot;educationally dubious&quot; in the 2002 book &quot;The Theory &amp; Practice of Teaching&quot;.

Tapper mentions that &quot;some large group-awareness training and psychotherapy groups&quot; exemplify non-religious &quot;cults&quot;.
Benjamin criticizes LGAT groups for their high prices and spiritual subtleties.

==LGAT techniques==
Specific techniques used in some Large Group Awareness Trainings may include:

* meditation
* biofeedback
* jargon
* self-hypnosis
* relaxation techniques
* visualization
* neuro-linguistic programming
* yoga

LGATs utilize such techniques during long sessions, sometimes called &quot;marathon&quot; sessions. Paglia describes &quot;EST&#x27;s Large Group Awareness Training&quot;: &quot;Marathon, eight-hour sessions, in which [participants] were confined and harassed, supposedly led to the breakdown of conventional ego, after which they were in effect born again.&quot;

Finkelstein&#x27;s 1982 article provides a detailed description of the structure and techniques of an Erhard Seminars Training event—techniques similar to those used in some group therapy and encounter groups. The academic textbook, &quot;Handbook of Group Psychotherapy&quot; regards Large Group Awareness Training organisations as &quot;less open to leader differences&quot;, because they follow a &quot;detailed written plan&quot; that does not vary from one training to the next.

In his book &quot;Life 102&quot;, LGAT participant and former trainer Peter McWilliams describes the basic technique of marathon trainings as &quot;pressure/release&quot; and asserts that advertising uses pressure/release &quot;all the time&quot;, as do &quot;good cop/bad cop&quot; police-interrogations and revival meetings. By spending approximately half the time making a person feel bad and then suddenly reversing the feeling through effusive praise, the programs cause participants to experience a stress-reaction and an &quot;endorphin high&quot;. McWilliams gives examples of various LGAT activities called &quot;processes&quot; with names such as &quot;love bomb&quot;, &quot;lifeboat&quot;, &quot;cocktail party&quot; and &quot;cradling&quot;, which take place over many hours and days, physically exhausting the participants to make them more susceptible to the trainer&#x27;s message, whether in the participants&#x27; best interests or not.

Although extremely critical of some LGATs, McWilliams found positive value in others, asserting that they varied not in technique but in the application of technique.

==LGATs and the anti-cult movement==

After commissioning a report in 1983 by the APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control (DIMPAC) chaired by anti-cult psychologist Margaret Singer, the American Psychological Association (APA) subsequently rejected and strongly criticised the 1986 DIMPAC report, which included large group awareness trainings as one example of what it called &quot;coercive persuasion&quot;. In 1997 the APA characterized Singer&#x27;s hypotheses as &quot;uninformed speculations based on skewed data&quot;. It stated in 1987 that the report generally lacked &quot;the scientific rigor and evenhanded critical approach necessary for APA imprimatur.&quot; The APA also stated that &quot;the specific methods by which Drs. Singer and Benson have arrived at their conclusions have also been rejected by all serious scholars in the field.&quot;
Singer sued the APA, and lost on June 17, 1994.
Despite the APA rejection of her task-force&#x27;s report, Singer remained in good standing among psychology researchers. Singer reworked much of the DIMPAC report material into the book &quot;Cults in Our Midst&quot; (1995, second edition: 2003), which she co-authored with Janja Lalich.

Singer and Lalich state that &quot;large group awareness trainings&quot; tend to last at least four days and usually five.
Their book mentions Erhard Seminars Training (&quot;est&quot;) and similar undertakings, such as the Landmark Forum, Lifespring, Actualizations, MSIA/Insight and PSI Seminars.

In &quot;Cults in our Midst&quot;, Singer differentiated between the usage of the terms &quot;cult&quot; and &quot;Large Group Awareness Training&quot;, while pointing out some commonalities.
Elsewhere she groups the two phenomena together, in that they both use a shared set of thought-reform techniques.

<doc id="113222" wikidata="Q170181" url="?curid=113222" title="Law of sines">
<text>In trigonometry, the law of sines, sine law, sine formula, or sine rule is an equation relating the lengths of the sides of any triangle to the sines of its angles. According to the law,
formula_1
where , and are the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and , and are the opposite angles (see figure 2), while is the radius of the triangle&#x27;s circumcircle. When the last part of the equation is not used, the law is sometimes stated using the reciprocals;
formula_2
The law of sines can be used to compute the remaining sides of a triangle when two angles and a side are known—a technique known as triangulation. It can also be used when two sides and one of the non-enclosed angles are known. In some such cases, the triangle is not uniquely determined by this data (called the &quot;ambiguous case&quot;) and the technique gives two possible values for the enclosed angle.

The law of sines is one of two trigonometric equations commonly applied to find lengths and angles in scalene triangles, with the other being the law of cosines.

The law of sines can be generalized to higher dimensions on surfaces with constant curvature.

==History==
An equivalent of the law of sines, that the sides of a triangle are proportional to the chords of double the opposite angles, was known to the 2nd century Hellenistic astronomer Ptolemy and used occasionally in his &quot;Almagest&quot;.

Statements related to the law of sines appear in the astronomical and trigonometric work of 7th century Indian mathematician Brahmagupta. In his &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot;, Brahmagupta expresses the circumradius of a triangle as the product of two sides divided by twice the altitude; the law of sines can be derived by alternately expressing the altitude as the sine of one or the other base angle times its opposite side, then equating the two resulting variants. An equation even closer to the modern law of sines appears in Brahmagupta&#x27;s &quot;Khaṇḍakhādyaka&quot;, in a method for finding the distance between the Earth and a planet following an epicycle; however, Brahmagupta never treated the law of sines as an independent subject or used it more systematically for solving triangles.

The spherical law of sines is sometimes credited to 10th century scholars Abu-Mahmud Khujandi or Abū al-Wafāʾ (it appears in his &quot;Almagest&quot;), but it is given prominence in Abū Naṣr Manṣūr&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on the Determination of Spherical Arcs&quot;, and was credited to Abū Naṣr Manṣūr by his student al-Bīrūnī in his &quot;Keys to Astronomy&quot;. Ibn Muʿādh al-Jayyānī&#x27;s 11th-century &quot;Book of Unknown Arcs of a Sphere&quot; also contains the spherical law of sines. 

The 13th-century Persian mathematician Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī stated and proved the planar law of sines: In any plane triangle, the ratio of the sides is equal to the ratio of the sines of the angles opposite to those sides. That is, in triangle ABC, we have AB : AC = Sin(∠ACB) : Sin(∠ABC) By employing the law of sines, al-Tusi could solve triangles where either two angles and a side were known or two sides and an angle opposite one of them were given. For triangles with two sides and the included angle, he divided them into right triangles that he could then solve. When three sides were given, he dropped a perpendicular line and then used Proposition II-13 of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; (a geometric version of the law of cosines). Al-Tusi established the important result that if the sum or difference of two arcs is provided along with the ratio of their sines, then the arcs can be calculated.

According to Glen Van Brummelen, &quot;The Law of Sines is really Regiomontanus&#x27;s foundation for his solutions of right-angled triangles in Book IV, and these solutions are in turn the bases for his solutions of general triangles.&quot; Regiomontanus was a 15th-century German mathematician.

==Proof==
With the side of length as the base, the triangle&#x27;s altitude can be computed as or as . Equating these two expressions gives
formula_3
and similar equations arise by choosing the side of length or the side of length as the base of the triangle.

==The ambiguous case of triangle solution==
When using the law of sines to find a side of a triangle, an ambiguous case occurs when two separate triangles can be constructed from the data provided (i.e., there are two different possible solutions to the triangle). In the case shown below they are triangles and .


Given a general triangle, the following conditions would need to be fulfilled for the case to be ambiguous:
* The only information known about the triangle is the angle and the sides and .
* The angle is acute (i.e., &lt; 90°).
* The side is shorter than the side (i.e., ).
* The side is longer than the altitude from angle , where (i.e., ).

If all the above conditions are true, then each of angles and produces a valid triangle, meaning that both of the following are true:
formula_4

From there we can find the corresponding and or and if required, where is the side bounded by vertices and and is bounded by and .

==Examples==
The following are examples of how to solve a problem using the law of sines.

===Example 1===

Given: side , side , and angle . Angle is desired.

Using the law of sines, we conclude that
formula_5
formula_6

Note that the potential solution is excluded because that would necessarily give .

===Example 2===

If the lengths of two sides of the triangle and are equal to , the third side has length , and the angles opposite the sides of lengths , , and are , , and respectively then
formula_7

==Relation to the circumcircle==
In the identity
formula_8
the common value of the three fractions is actually the diameter of the triangle&#x27;s circumcircle. This result dates back to Ptolemy.

=== Proof ===
As shown in the figure, let there be a circle with inscribed formula_9 and another inscribed formula_10 that passes through the circle&#x27;s center . The formula_11 has a central angle of formula_12 and thus by Thales&#x27;s theorem. Since formula_13 is a right triangle,
formula_14
where formula_15 is the radius of the circumscribing circle of the triangle. Angles formula_16 and formula_17 lie on the same circle and subtend the same chord ; thus, by the inscribed angle theorem, Therefore,
formula_18

Rearranging yields
formula_19

Repeating the process of creating formula_10 with other points gives

 = \frac{b}{\sin{\beta}} = \frac{c}{\sin{\gamma}}=2R.&lt;/math&gt;}}

=== Relationship to the area of the triangle ===
The area of a triangle is given by where formula_21 is the angle enclosed by the sides of lengths and . Substituting the sine law into this equation gives
formula_22

Taking formula_23 as the circumscribing radius,

It can also be shown that this equality implies
formula_24
where is the area of the triangle and is the semiperimeter 

The second equality above readily simplifies to Heron&#x27;s formula for the area.

The sine rule can also be used in deriving the following formula for the triangle&#x27;s area: denoting the semi-sum of the angles&#x27; sines as we have

where formula_23 is the radius of the circumcircle: 

==Spherical law of sines==

The spherical law of sines deals with triangles on a sphere, whose sides are arcs of great circles.

Suppose the radius of the sphere is 1. Let , , and be the lengths of the great-arcs that are the sides of the triangle. Because it is a unit sphere, , , and are the angles at the center of the sphere subtended by those arcs, in radians. Let , , and be the angles opposite those respective sides. These are dihedral angles between the planes of the three great circles.

Then the spherical law of sines says:
formula_26

=== Vector proof ===
Consider a unit sphere with three unit vectors , and drawn from the origin to the vertices of the triangle. Thus the angles , , and are the angles , , and , respectively. The arc subtends an angle of magnitude at the centre. Introduce a Cartesian basis with along the -axis and in the -plane making an angle with the -axis. The vector projects to in the -plane and the angle between and the -axis is . Therefore, the three vectors have components:
formula_27

The scalar triple product, is the volume of the parallelepiped formed by the position vectors of the vertices of the spherical triangle , and . This volume is invariant to the specific coordinate system used to represent , and . The value of the scalar triple product is the determinant with , and as its rows. With the -axis along the square of this determinant is
formula_28
Repeating this calculation with the -axis along gives , while with the -axis along it is . Equating these expressions and dividing throughout by gives
formula_29
where is the volume of the parallelepiped formed by the position vector of the vertices of the spherical triangle. Consequently, the result follows.

It is easy to see how for small spherical triangles, when the radius of the sphere is much greater than the sides of the triangle, this formula becomes the planar formula at the limit, since
formula_30
and the same for and .

=== Geometric proof ===
Consider a unit sphere with:
formula_31

Construct point formula_32 and point formula_33 such that formula_34

Construct point formula_35 such that formula_36

It can therefore be seen that formula_37 and formula_38

Notice that formula_35 is the projection of formula_40 on plane formula_41. Therefore formula_42

By basic trigonometry, we have:
formula_43

But formula_44

Combining them we have:
formula_45

By applying similar reasoning, we obtain the spherical law of sine:
formula_46

=== Other proofs ===
A purely algebraic proof can be constructed from the spherical law of cosines. From the identity formula_47 and the explicit expression for formula_48 from the spherical law of cosines
formula_49
Since the right hand side is invariant under a cyclic permutation of formula_50 the spherical sine rule follows immediately.

The figure used in the Geometric proof above is used by and also provided in Banerjee (see Figure 3 in this paper) to derive the sine law using elementary linear algebra and projection matrices.

==Hyperbolic case==
In hyperbolic geometry when the curvature is −1, the law of sines becomes
formula_51

In the special case when is a right angle, one gets
formula_52

which is the analog of the formula in Euclidean geometry expressing the sine of an angle as the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse.

== The case of surfaces of constant curvature ==

Define a generalized sine function, depending also on a real parameter formula_53:
formula_54

The law of sines in constant curvature formula_53 reads as
formula_56

By substituting formula_57, formula_58, and formula_59, one obtains respectively formula_60, formula_61, and formula_62, that is, the Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic cases of the law of sines described above.

Let formula_63 indicate the circumference of a circle of radius formula_64 in a space of constant curvature formula_53. Then formula_66. Therefore, the law of sines can also be expressed as:
formula_67

This formulation was discovered by János Bolyai.

==Higher dimensions==
A tetrahedron has four triangular facets. The absolute value of the polar sine () of the normal vectors to the three facets that share a vertex of the tetrahedron, divided by the area of the fourth facet will not depend upon the choice of the vertex:

formula_68

More generally, for an -dimensional simplex (i.e., triangle (), tetrahedron (), pentatope (), etc.) in -dimensional Euclidean space, the absolute value of the polar sine of the normal vectors of the facets that meet at a vertex, divided by the hyperarea of the facet opposite the vertex is independent of the choice of the vertex. Writing for the hypervolume of the -dimensional simplex and for the product of the hyperareas of its -dimensional facets, the common ratio is
formula_69

<doc id="113226" wikidata="Q1393337" url="?curid=113226" title="A Charlie Brown Christmas">
<text>A Charlie Brown Christmas is a 1965 animated television special. It is the first TV special based on the comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot;, by Charles M. Schulz, and features the voices of Peter Robbins, Christopher Shea, Kathy Steinberg, Tracy Stratford, and Bill Melendez. Produced by Lee Mendelson and directed by Melendez, the program made its debut on the CBS television network on December 9, 1965. In the special, Charlie Brown (Robbins) finds himself depressed despite the onset of the cheerful holiday season. After Lucy van Pelt (Stratford) suggests he direct a neighborhood Christmas play, his best efforts are ignored and mocked by his peers when he chooses a puny Christmas tree as a centerpiece.

After the comic strip&#x27;s debut in 1950, &quot;Peanuts&quot; had become a worldwide phenomenon by the mid-1960s. The special was commissioned and sponsored by The Coca-Cola Company, and was written over a period of several weeks, and produced on a small budget in six months. In casting the characters, the producers took an unconventional route, hiring child actors. The program&#x27;s soundtrack was similarly unorthodox, featuring a jazz score by pianist Vince Guaraldi.

Its lack of a laugh track (a staple in US television animation in this period), in addition to its tone, pacing, music, and animation, led both the producers and the network to predict the project would be a disaster. However, contrary to their collective apprehension, &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; received high ratings and acclaim from critics. It received an Emmy and a Peabody Award, and became an annual presentation in the United States, airing on broadcast television during the Christmas season for 56 years before becoming exclusively available on Apple TV+ streaming service. Its success paved the way for a series of Peanuts television specials and films. Its jazz soundtrack achieved commercial success, selling five million copies in the US. Live theatrical versions of &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; have been staged.

==Plot==
On their way to join their friends ice skating on a frozen pond, Charlie Brown confesses to Linus van Pelt that, despite all the things he likes about the Christmas season, he is still depressed. After Linus&#x27; reproach, and a put-down from Violet, he visits Lucy van Pelt&#x27;s psychiatric booth and tells her his problem. She suggests that he direct the group&#x27;s annual Christmas play to get involved, and he accepts.

Charlie Brown becomes even more discouraged by his observations of Christmas&#x27; commercialization as he heads for the rehearsal: Lucy laments over not receiving real estate for Christmas; Snoopy decorates his doghouse for a neighborhood lights and display contest; and Charlie Brown&#x27;s younger sister Sally asks him to write a greedy letter to Santa Claus. At the rehearsal, Charlie Brown finds a play fit for the 1960s with dancing, lively music, an uncooperative cast and a &quot;Christmas Queen&quot; (Lucy). Unable to control the cast, Charlie Brown decides the play needs a more &quot;proper mood&quot;, and recommends a Christmas tree. Lucy suggests a big, pink aluminum Christmas tree, then sends him and Linus to get one.

At the tree lot, Charlie Brown picks the only real tree there, a small sapling. Linus questions his choice, but Charlie Brown believes that once decorated, it will be perfect. Upon their return, Lucy, Violet, Patty and Frieda scorn him and the tree and walk away laughing. Crestfallen, Charlie Brown loudly asks if anyone knows what Christmas is all about. Linus says he does, walks to center stage, asks for a spotlight, drops his security blanket, recites the King James Version of the annunciation to the shepherds, picks up his blanket, returns and says, &quot;That&#x27;s what Christmas is all about, Charlie Brown.&quot;

Realizing that he does not have to let commercialism ruin his own Christmas, Charlie Brown takes the tree home to decorate it and show the others that it will work in the play. The others realize that they were too hard on Charlie Brown and quietly follow him after listening to Linus&#x27; speech. He stops at Snoopy&#x27;s doghouse, which has won the lights and display contest, and hangs a large red ornament on his tree. The ornament&#x27;s weight causes the tiny tree to bend to the ground. Believing that he killed the tree, Charlie Brown becomes so dejected, that he walks away.

The others arrive at Snoopy&#x27;s doghouse and as they all start to see its potential, Linus gently uprights the drooping tree and wraps his blanket around its base to give it some support. After the others give the tree a makeover using more decorations from the doghouse, even Lucy concedes to Charlie Brown&#x27;s choice. The kids then start humming &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot;. Hearing them, Charlie Brown returns to see that the sapling is now a fully decorated Christmas tree. All the kids shout, &quot;Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown!&quot;, and then sing &quot;Hark&quot; with Charlie Brown and Snoopy (original version only) joining in as snow begins to fall.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
By the early 1960s, Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot; had gained enormous popularity. Television producer Lee Mendelson acknowledged the strip&#x27;s cultural impression and had an idea for a documentary on its success, phoning Schulz to propose the idea. Schulz, an avid baseball fan, recognized Mendelson from his documentary on ballplayer Willie Mays, &quot;A Man Named Mays&quot;, and invited him to his home in Sebastopol, California, to discuss the project. Their meeting was cordial, with the plan to produce a half-hour documentary set. Mendelson wanted to feature roughly &quot;one or two&quot; minutes of animation, and Schulz suggested animator Bill Melendez, with whom he collaborated some years before on a spot for the Ford Motor Company. Mendelson later stated that he was drawn to doing an animated Charlie Brown after working on &quot;A Man Named Mays&quot;, noting that Mays was arguably the best baseball player of all time, while Charlie Brown, in a running gag in the strips, was one of the worst, making him a natural follow-up subject to his previous work.

Despite the popularity of the strip and acclaim from advertisers, networks were not interested in the special. By April 1965, &quot;Time&quot; featured the &quot;Peanuts&quot; gang on its magazine cover, prompting a call from John Allen of the New York-based McCann Erickson Agency. Mendelson imagined he would sell his documentary, and blindly agreed to Allen&#x27;s proposal: an animated half-hour &quot;Peanuts&quot; Christmas special. The Coca-Cola Company was looking for a special to sponsor during the holiday season. &quot;The bad news is that today is Wednesday and they&#x27;ll need an outline in Atlanta by Monday,&quot; Allen remarked to Mendelson. He quickly contacted Schulz, and the two got to work with plans for a &quot;Peanuts&quot; Christmas special. The duo prepared an outline for the Coca-Cola executives in less than one day, and Mendelson would later recall that the bulk of ideas came from Schulz, whose &quot;ideas flowed nonstop.&quot; According to Mendelson, their pitch to Coca-Cola consisted of &quot;winter scenes, a school play, a scene to be read from the Bible, and a sound track combining jazz and traditional music.&quot; The outline did not change over the course of its production.

As Allen was in Europe, the duo received no feedback on their pitch for several days. When Allen got in touch with them, he informed them that Coca-Cola wanted to buy the special, but also wanted it for an early December broadcast, giving the duo just six months to scramble together a team to produce the special. Mendelson assured him – without complete confidence in his statements – that this would be no problem. Following this, &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; entered production, and was completed just ten days shy of its national broadcast premiere.

=== Writing ===

Schulz&#x27;s main goal for a &quot;Peanuts&quot;-based Christmas special was to focus on the true meaning of Christmas. He desired to juxtapose this theme with interspersed shots of snow and ice-skating, perhaps inspired by his own childhood growing up in St. Paul, Minnesota. He also created the idea for the school play, and mixing jazz with traditional Christmas carols. Schulz was adamant about Linus&#x27; reading of the Bible, despite Mendelson and Melendez&#x27;s concerns that religion was a controversial topic, especially on television. Melendez recalled Schulz turned to him and remarked, &quot;If we don&#x27;t do it, who will?&quot; Schulz&#x27;s estimation proved accurate, and in the 1960s, fewer than nine percent of television Christmas episodes contained a substantive reference to religion, according to university researcher Stephen Lind.

Schulz&#x27;s faith in the Bible stemmed from his Midwest background and religious and historical studies; as such, aspects of religion would be a topic of study throughout his life. According to a 2015 &quot;spiritual biography&quot;, Schulz&#x27;s religion was personal and complex, and would be integrated in a number of his programs.

The program&#x27;s script has been described as &quot;barebones&quot;, and was completed in only a few weeks. In the days following the special&#x27;s sale to Coca-Cola, Mendelson and animator Bill Melendez met with Schulz in his home to expand upon the ideas promised in the pitch. Mendelson remembered that on the previous Christmas Day he and his spouse had read Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s &quot;The Fir-Tree&quot; to their children. Schulz countered with the idea that there be a tree with the spirit of lead character Charlie Brown. They spoke at length about creating an official theme that was neither jazz nor traditional to open the program. Schulz wanted a part of the special to feature the character of Schroeder performing Beethoven, and Mendelson combined this with the inclusion of Vince Guaraldi&#x27;s &quot;Linus and Lucy&quot; number. Schulz penned the script for &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;, with Melendez plotting out the animation via a storyboard. His storyboard contained six panels for each shot, spanning a combined eighty or-so pages.

Mendelson also suggested they employ a laugh track, a staple of television animation, but Schulz rejected this idea immediately. &quot;Up until then, many, if not all, animated shows had laugh tracks,&quot; said Mendelson. &quot;As we were discussing how we would handle our special, I said very casually, &#x27;I assume we&#x27;ll have a laugh track.&#x27; It was a statement, not a question. Sparky just got up and quietly walked out of the room. We looked at each other, then Bill said, &#x27;Well, I guess we won&#x27;t have a laugh track.&#x27; Sparky came back in the room, and we went on with the meeting as if the subject had never come up.&quot; Schulz felt strongly that the audience at home should not be instructed when to laugh.

=== Casting ===
In casting the silent comic strip characters of &quot;Peanuts&quot;, the trio pulled from their personalities. Lead character Charlie Brown&#x27;s voice was decided to be downbeat and nondescript (&quot;blah,&quot; as Mendelson observed), while Lucy should be bold and forthright. Linus&#x27; voice, it was decided, would combine sophistication with childlike innocence. Mendelson recognized that the character of Snoopy was the strip&#x27;s most popular character who seemed to seize &quot;the best jokes,&quot; but realized they could not cast a voice for the cartoon dog. &quot;In the process, we gained a veritable &#x27;canine Harpo Marx,&#x27;&quot; Mendelson later wrote. Melendez suggested he provide gibberish for Snoopy&#x27;s mutterings, and simply speed up the tape to prevent viewers from knowing. There are no adult characters in the strip or in this special. Later specials would introduce an offscreen teacher; her lines are eschewed for the sound of a muted trombone (suggested by Guaraldi) as the team behind the specials found it humorous.

With this in mind, the trio set out to cast the characters, which proved to be a daunting process. Casting for Charlie Brown proved most difficult, as it required both good acting skills but also the ability to appear nonchalant. The producers picked eight-year-old Peter Robbins, already known for his roles spanning television, film, and advertisements. Robbins considered Charlie Brown to be one of his favorite characters, and despite leaving acting as an adult, he considered his time in the role a highlight of his life. His godmother, Hollywood agent Hazel McMillen, discovered Christopher Shea, who would become Linus in the special. His slight lisp, according to Mendelson, gave him a &quot;youthful sweetness,&quot; while his emotional script reading &quot;gave him power and authority as well.&quot; Tracy Stratford played the role of Lucy, with the creators being impressed by her attitude and professionalism. Kathy Steinberg was the youngest of the performers, just six years old at the time of recording. Too young to read, the producers had to give her one line at a time to recite. Robbins remembered Melendez did this for him as well, joking that he also mistakenly copied his Latino accent. Mendelson desired to have non-actors (not &quot;Hollywood kids&quot;) perform on the special, and he sent tape recorders home with his employees for their children to audition.

Much of the background cast came from Mendelson&#x27;s home neighborhood in northern California. According to Robbins, the children viewed the script&#x27;s sophisticated dialogue as &quot;edgy,&quot; finding several words and phrases, among them &quot;eastern syndicate&quot;, difficult to pronounce. He recalled the recording sessions as chaotic, with excited children running rampant. Nevertheless, the recording of &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; was completed in one day. Jefferson Airplane was recording next door and came over to obtain the children&#x27;s autographs. Following the special&#x27;s broadcast, the children became wildly popular in their respective elementary schools; Robbins recalled groups approaching him asking him to recite lines of dialogue.

=== Animation ===
Animation for &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; was created by Bill Melendez Productions. Mendelson had no idea whether or not completing a half-hour&#x27;s worth of animation would be possible given the production&#x27;s six-month schedule, but Melendez confirmed its feasibility. In actuality, animation was only completed in the final four months of production. CBS initially wanted an hour&#x27;s worth of animation, but Melendez talked them down to a half-hour special, believing an hour of television animation was too much. Having never worked on a half-hour special before, Melendez phoned William Hanna of Hanna-Barbera for advice, but Hanna declined to give any. CBS gave a budget of $76,000 to produce the show and it went $20,000 over budget. The first step in creating the animation was to make a pencil drawing, afterwards inking and painting the drawing onto a cel. The cel was then placed onto a painted background. There are 13,000 drawings in the special, with 12 frames per second to create the illusion of movement.

Melendez had previously worked for Warner Bros. and Disney, and working on &quot;Peanuts&quot;-related material gave him a chance to animate a truly flat cartoon design. The movement of Schulz&#x27;s characters, particularly the &quot;Peanuts&quot; gang, was limited. The character of Snoopy, however, proved the exception to the rule. &quot;He can do anything – move and dance – and he&#x27;s very easy to animate,&quot; said Melendez. Schulz had envisioned the special as essentially talking heads reciting the script; animator Bill Littlejohn recalled meeting resistance from Schulz when he and Melendez designed the sequence of Snoopy dancing on Schroeder&#x27;s piano, as Schulz was concerned it distracted too much from the plot.

== Soundtrack ==

The soundtrack to &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; is an unorthodox mix of traditional Christmas music and jazz. The jazz portions were created by the Vince Guaraldi Trio. Producer Lee Mendelson, a fan of jazz, heard Guaraldi&#x27;s crossover hit &quot;Cast Your Fate to the Wind&quot; on the radio not long after completion of his documentary &quot;Charlie Brown &amp; Charles Schulz&quot;, and contacted the musician to produce music for the special. Guaraldi composed the music for the project, creating an entire piece, &quot;Linus and Lucy,&quot; to serve as the theme. When Coca-Cola commissioned &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; in spring 1965, Guaraldi returned to write the music. The first instrumentals for the special were recorded by Guaraldi at Glendale, California&#x27;s Whitney Studio with bassist Monty Budwig and drummer Colin Bailey. Recycling &quot;Linus and Lucy&quot; from the earlier special, Guaraldi completed two new originals for the special, &quot;Skating&quot;, and &quot;Christmas Time Is Here&quot;. In the weeks preceding the premiere, Mendelson encountered trouble finding a lyricist for Guaraldi&#x27;s instrumental intro, and penned &quot;Christmas Time is Here&quot; in &quot;about 15 minutes&quot; on the back of an envelope.

The special opens and closes with a choir of children, culled from St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church in San Rafael, California, performing &quot;Christmas Time Is Here&quot; and &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot;. One of the singers, Candace Hackett Shively, went on to become an elementary school teacher, and sent a letter of gratitude to Schulz after he announced his retirement in 2000. In the letter, she recalls recording the choir at Fantasy Studios and going out for ice cream afterwards, while also saying she tells the story to her grade-schoolers each holiday season. The recording sessions were conducted in late autumn 1965 and were cut in three separate sessions over two weeks. They often ran late into the night, resulting in angry parents, some who forbade their children from returning; consequently, numerous new children were present at each session. The children were directed by Barry Mineah, who demanded perfection from the choir. Mendelson and Guaraldi disagreed, desiring the &quot;kids to sound like kids&quot;; they used a slightly off-key version of &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot; in the final cut. Children were paid five dollars for their participation. In addition, the children recorded dialogue for the special&#x27;s final scene, in which the crowd of kids shout &quot;Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown!&quot;

The soundtrack for the special was recorded during these sessions, with decisions regarding timing and phrasing determined quickly. Guaraldi brought in bassist Fred Marshall and drummer Jerry Granelli to record the music, and spent time later re-recording earlier tracks, including covers of &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; and &quot;Greensleeves.&quot; The eventual LP release credited Guaraldi solely, neglecting to mention the other musicians; Guaraldi was notorious for never keeping records of his session players. Nearly three decades later, in an effort to resolve the matter, Fantasy surmised that the recordings with Budwig and Bailey were employed in the special, while Marshall and Granelli recorded the album. Despite this, other individuals have come forward claiming to have recorded the special&#x27;s music: bassists Eugene Firth and Al Obidinski, and drummers Paul Distel and Benny Barth. Firth and Distil are listed as performers on a studio-session report Guaraldi filed for the American Federation of Musicians.

&quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2007, and added to the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Recording Registry list of &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically important&quot; American sound recordings in 2012.

&quot;I have always felt that one of the key elements that made that show was the music,&quot; said Mendelson in 2010. &quot;It gave it a contemporary sound that appealed to all ages. Although Vince had never scored anything else and although I was basically a documentary film maker at the time, we started to work together on the cues because we both loved jazz and we both played the piano. So he would bring in the material for each scene and we would go over it scene by scene. Most of the time, the music worked perfectly. But there were times we would either not use something or use it somewhere else. We went through this same process on all sixteen shows. Although there was always some left over music, most of the time what he wrote and performed is what went on the air.&quot;

== Reception ==
All involved believed the special would be a disaster. Melendez first saw the completed animation at a showing in a theater in the days before its premiere, turning to his crew of animators and remarking, &quot;My golly, we&#x27;ve killed it.&quot; Melendez was embarrassed, but one of the animators, Ed Levitt, was more positive regarding the special, telling him it was &quot;the best special [he&#x27;ll] ever make [...] This show is going to run for a hundred years.&quot; Mendelson was similar in his assumptions of the show&#x27;s quality, and when he showed the film to network executives in New York, their opinions were also negative. Their complaints included the show&#x27;s slow pace, the music not fitting, and the animation too simple. &quot;I really believed, if it hadn&#x27;t been scheduled for the following week, there&#x27;s no way they were gonna broadcast that show,&quot; Mendelson later said. Executives had invited television critic Richard Burgheim of &quot;Time&quot; to view the special, and debated whether showing it to him would be a good idea. His review, printed the following week, was positive, praising the special as unpretentious and writing that &quot;&quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; is one children&#x27;s special this season that bears repeating.&quot;

The program premiered on CBS on December 9, 1965, at 7:30 pm ET (pre-empting &quot;The Munsters&quot;), and was viewed by 45% of those watching television that evening, with the number of homes watching the special an estimated 15,490,000, placing it at number two in the ratings, behind &quot;Bonanza&quot; on NBC. The special received critical acclaim: &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; deemed the show &quot;delightfully novel and amusing,&quot; while the &quot;Weekly Variety&quot; dubbed it &quot;fascinating and haunting.&quot; Bob Williams of the &quot;New York Post&quot; praised the &quot;very neat transition from comic page to screen,&quot; while Lawrence Laurent of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; declared that &quot;natural-born loser Charlie Brown finally turned up a real winner last night.&quot; Harriet Van Horne of the &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot; hailed the scene in which Linus recites scripture, commenting, &quot;Linus&#x27; reading of the story of the Nativity was, quite simply, the dramatic highlight of the season.&quot; Harry Harris of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; called the program &quot;a yule classic [...] generated quiet warmth and amusement,&quot; and Terrence O&#x27;Flaherty of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Charlie Brown&quot; was a gem of a television show.&quot; Ben Gross of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; praised the special&#x27;s &quot;charm and good taste,&quot; while Rick DuBrow of United Press International predicted, &quot;the &quot;Peanuts&quot; characters last night staked out a claim to a major television future.&quot; 

The film has an aggregated review score of 86% based on 21 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. Of the three negative reviews, two come from the same 2020 episode of &quot;Medium Popcorn&quot;, a podcast in which both hosts gave the special a one-out-of-five stars review. The third is a 2005 two-out-of-five star review from Emanuel Levy that is no longer available.

The show&#x27;s positive reviews were highlighted with an ad in trade magazines; one thanked Coca-Cola, CBS, United Features Syndicate, and the show&#x27;s viewers. Fantasy released the special&#x27;s soundtrack the first week of December 1965, coinciding with the special&#x27;s airdate. United Feature Syndicate pushed hard to promote the special, while Word Publishing issued a hardcover adaption of the special. CBS promptly ordered four additional &quot;Peanuts&quot; specials. &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; was awarded the Emmy Award for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program in 1966, making it the second animated TV program to win that award after Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;The Huckleberry Hound Show&quot;. &quot;Charlie Brown is not used to winning, so we thank you,&quot; Schulz joked.

When the special was aired for a second time in December 1966, it once again ranked No. 2 in the ratings, and again behind only &quot;Bonanza&quot;. In 1970, a viewer survey by Clarke Williamson ranked the special as the best Christmas special to air that year.

In 2022, an internal poll of writers at Fatherly ranked the special at 62 in a list of the 100 greatest family-friendly films of all time, one of only two productions made specifically for television to make the list (the other being the 1966 version of &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot;). In its summary, the writers noted that the special&#x27;s technical flaws &quot;are what makes &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; feel distinct and special rather than generic&quot; and that its low-budget feel fit the theme of the story.

== Television broadcasts ==
===CBS===
The special was originally broadcast on CBS in 1965 and rerun each year from 1966 until 2000.

The original broadcasts included references to the sponsor, Coca-Cola. Because of Dolly Madison&#x27;s eventual co-sponsorship of the series, as well as subsequent FCC laws mandating the separation of commercial material from the actual program material, subsequent broadcasts and home media releases removed all references to Coca-Cola products. Broadcasts of the special in later years also had some scenes, animation, and sound effects redone for correction. Snoopy&#x27;s dog bowl was repainted red instead of white, Lucy now makes a whirling noise when scared out of her psychiatric booth, new animation was placed in scenes where the children dance on stage after the first time to avoid repetition, music was added in the background of the rehearsal scenes, and Snoopy no longer sings with the children in the final carol, amongst others.

Removed from some subsequent broadcasts is a scene in which Linus throws a snowball at a tin can using his blanket. For several years it was rumored the can was a Coca-Cola can. However, a recently obtained copy of the original print disproves this rumor, showing the can was always a generic tin can.

===ABC===
Beginning with the 2001 holiday season, ABC held rights to the special. On December 6, 2001, a half-hour documentary on the special titled &quot;The Making of &#x27;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;&#x27; (hosted by Whoopi Goldberg) aired on ABC. This documentary has been released as a special feature on the DVD and Blu-ray editions of the special. In subsequent years, to allow the special in an hour timeslot to be broadcast uncut for time, the animated vignette collection, &quot;Charlie Brown&#x27;s Christmas Tales&quot;, is broadcast in the remaining time for that hour.

The show&#x27;s 40th anniversary broadcast on December 6, 2005, had the highest ratings in its time slot.

The 50th anniversary broadcast aired on November 30, 2015, and it featured a full two-hour time slot that was padded by a special, &quot;It&#x27;s Your 50th Christmas, Charlie Brown&quot;, which was hosted by Kristen Bell, and featured musical performances by Kristin Chenoweth, Matthew Morrison, Sarah McLachlan, Boyz II Men, Pentatonix, David Benoit, and the All-American Boys Chorus. It also included documentary features. After 18 consecutive years of being broadcast on the network, the special aired on ABC for the last time on December 17, 2019, at 8pm ET/PT.

===Apple TV+===
In October 2020, Apple TV+ acquired exclusive rights to all &quot;Peanuts&quot;-related media. Under the terms of the agreement, Apple TV+ must make &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; and two other holiday specials (&quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&quot; and &quot;A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving&quot;) available for free on the platform during a three-day window. The window for &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; was from December 11 to 13, 2020, and in 2022 it was from December 22 through December 25. Subscribers to Apple TV+ have a broader window to watch the specials.

===PBS===
After mounting criticism over Apple&#x27;s decision to remove the &quot;Peanuts&quot; specials from free television, the company announced a deal with PBS to resume the annual broadcast tradition. In accordance with most PBS member stations&#x27; non-commercial educational licenses, the special was presented on PBS without commercial interruption, with an underwriting message from Apple being the only advertising. PBS, Apple and WildBrain, the rightsholder to the &quot;Peanuts&quot; television library, announced they had renewed the arrangement in October 2021. PBS did not acquire the broadcast rights for the &quot;Peanuts&quot; specials in 2022, ending a 57 year run on broadcast television.

==Home media==

In 1985, the special was released on VHS and Betamax by Media Home Entertainment, along with &quot;You&#x27;re Not Elected, Charlie Brown&quot;. In 1987 the special was released on VHS by its kids subsidiary, Hi-Tops Video. 

On September 28, 1994, the special was released by Paramount on VHS. A laserdisc was released by Paramount (distributed by Pioneer) in 1996; Side 2 contained the 1979 special &quot;You&#x27;re the Greatest, Charlie Brown&quot;. In September 2000 it was released on DVD. Bonus features included the 1992 special &quot;It&#x27;s Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown&quot;. On September 23, 2008, Warner Home Video (to which the rights to the Peanuts specials reverted earlier in the year, due to Melendez&#x27;s connections to WB) released a &quot;remastered&quot; DVD. Bonus features include a restored version of &quot;Christmastime Again&quot; and a new documentary titled &quot;A Christmas Miracle: The Making of &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;&quot;.

On October 6, 2009, it was released in high definition Blu-ray Disc from Warner in remastered Dolby 5.1 surround sound. This disc also contains &quot;It&#x27;s Christmastime Again&quot;, &quot;A Christmas Miracle&quot;, a DVD of the special, and a Digital Copy.

Since off-network rights to this special have been transferred to Warner Bros., it has become available as a download on the iTunes Store, PlayStation Network, Amazon Instant Video, and Google Play, and includes &quot;It&#x27;s Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown&quot;
and &quot;It&#x27;s Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown&quot;.

In December 2014, a 50th anniversary 2-DVD set was released. It also features the special &quot;It&#x27;s Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown&quot;, and the &quot;Making of...&quot; documentary from previous editions.

On October 31, 2017, it was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray disc containing &quot;It&#x27;s Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown&quot; and the &quot;Making of...&quot; special.

== Legacy ==
&quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; has become a Christmas staple in the United States. Within the scope of future &quot;Peanuts&quot; specials, it established their style, combining thoughtful themes, jazzy scores, and simple animation. It also, according to author Charles Solomon, established the half-hour animated special as a television tradition, inspiring the creation of numerous others, including &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot; (1966) and &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot; (1969). (Earlier animated specials such as &quot;Mr. Magoo&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; and &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; ran a full hour.) &quot;USA Today&quot; summarized the program&#x27;s appeal upon its 40th anniversary in 2005: &quot;Scholars of pop culture say that shining through the program&#x27;s skeletal plot is the quirky and sophisticated genius that fueled the phenomenal popularity of Schulz&#x27;s work.&quot; Beyond its references to religion, unheard of on television at the time, the special also marked the first time children voiced animated characters.

The special influenced dozens of young aspiring artists and animators, many of whom went on to work within both the comics and animation industries, among them Eric Goldberg (&quot;Pocahontas&quot;), Pete Docter (&quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Up&quot;), Andrew Stanton (&quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, &quot;WALL-E&quot;), Jef Mallett (&quot;Frazz&quot;), and Patrick McDonnell (&quot;Mutts&quot;). The show&#x27;s score made an equally pervasive impact on viewers who would later perform jazz, among them David Benoit and George Winston. More directly, the special launched a series of Peanuts films, TV specials (many of them holiday-themed) and other works of entertainment.

Linus&#x27; speech near the end of the special was used in the Sidewalk Prophets Christmas song &quot;What a Glorious Night&quot;.

The problems encountered during the special&#x27;s production prompted CBS to place a &quot;premium on quality&quot; for its future Christmas specials, and for &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot;, CBS allotted Chuck Jones a budget of $315,000, quadrupling its budget compared to &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;.

== Stage adaptation ==

In 2013, Tams-Witmark Music Library, Inc. began licensing an official stage version of the television special authorized by the Schulz family and Lee Mendelson. The stage version follows the television special but includes an optional sing-along section of Christmas songs at the end. It includes all of Vince Guaraldi&#x27;s music from the television special and the television script is adapted for the stage by Eric Schaeffer. It has been performed at hundreds of schools, churches and community theatres.

==The Charlie Brown Christmas Tree==
Charlie Brown&#x27;s insistence on purchasing a real tree and disparagement of the aluminum Christmas tree practically eliminated the popularity of the aluminum tree, which was a fad at the time of the special. By 1967, they were no longer being regularly manufactured, to the point that most modern viewers of the special are unfamiliar with this type of artificial tree. On the contrary, artificial models of Charlie Brown&#x27;s &quot;poor tree&quot; are offered by various retailers and have become synonymous with minimalist Christmas decorating.

<text>Mister Magoo&#x27;s Christmas Carol is a 1962 animated musical holiday television special produced by UPA. It is an adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; 1843 novella &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, and it features UPA&#x27;s character Mr. Magoo as Ebenezer Scrooge. The special first aired on December 18, 1962, on NBC and was the first animated Christmas special to be produced specifically for television.

Jim Backus provides the voice of Magoo, with additional voices provided by Paul Frees, Morey Amsterdam, Joan Gardner, and Jack Cassidy. The special is directed by Abe Levitow and features songs composed by Jule Styne, with lyrics by Bob Merrill, while Walter Scharf arranged and conducted the orchestral score.

==Plot==
Mr. Magoo is heading to a theater on Broadway, where he is starring as Ebenezer Scrooge in a musical production based on &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. Due to Magoo&#x27;s nearsightedness, he arrives 30 minutes late and accidentally injures the director (&quot;It&#x27;s Great to Be Back on Broadway&quot;).

Scrooge is a miserly money lender in Victorian London on Christmas Eve, counting money while his clerk Bob Cratchit is underpaid and has no coal for his fire (&quot;Ringle, Ringle&quot;). After rudely refusing two men who ask him for a donation to charity, Scrooge reluctantly allows Cratchit to take the holiday off. Scrooge goes home and gets ready for bed, but is visited by the ghost of his business partner Jacob Marley, who has been dead for seven years. Marley is bound in heavy chains due to his misdeeds in life and warns Scrooge that he risks the same fate unless he heeds the advice of three spirits who will visit him over the course of the night.

The Ghost of Christmas Present visits Scrooge first and takes him to observe Cratchit and his family, who are counting their blessings despite their poor situation (&quot;The Lord&#x27;s Bright Blessing&quot;). The Ghost warns Scrooge that Cratchit&#x27;s young son Tiny Tim, who is sickly, will not survive to next Christmas if things do not change.

The Ghost of Christmas Past visits Scrooge next and takes him back to his boyhood, where Scrooge was a lonely schoolboy (&quot;Alone in the World&quot;). The Ghost also shows him Belle, a woman whom Scrooge, as a young man, had been courting; the moments he sees are those in which she sadly explains that she is leaving him due to his greed for money (&quot;Winter Was Warm&quot;).

Scrooge encounters the Ghost of Christmas Yet-to-Come and is shown a vision of the future, where an unloved man has recently died. Scrooge sees his charwoman, his laundress, and the local undertaker sell his belongings to a fence named Old Joe (&quot;We&#x27;re Despicable (Plunderer&#x27;s March)&quot;). Scrooge begs to be shown &quot;tenderness connected with death&quot;, but discovers that Tiny Tim has died. The Ghost takes Scrooge to a cemetery and shows him his own grave, revealing that this deceased man is him. Scrooge realizes in anguish that he has spent his life poorly, and repents (&quot;Alone in the World (Reprise)&quot;).

Scrooge awakens on Christmas morning with a renewed purpose. He meets the two men from the previous day and makes a generous donation, then anonymously sends Cratchit a Christmas turkey. He later visits Cratchit to give him a raise in pay and help nurse Tiny Tim back to health, and shares Christmas together with them (&quot;The Lord&#x27;s Bright Blessing (Reprise)&quot;).

The musical concludes and the audience applauds. Magoo brings the director out on stage, but the stage&#x27;s props, lights and scenery fall on him. Magoo proudly exclaims &quot;Oh, Magoo, you&#x27;ve done it again, and by George, I&#x27;ve brought down the house!&quot; and wishes both his audience and the television audience a Merry Christmas.

==Background==
&quot;Mister Magoo&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; was produced by UPA in its last days as an animation studio, following its acquisition by Henry G. Saperstein. UPA later produced a television series titled &quot;The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo&quot;, in which Magoo portrayed other literary characters. The series ended soon after as UPA was unable to mass-produce cartoons for television. It fills an hour-long time slot, as opposed to half an hour, which is different from most animated Christmas specials.

The special depicts the visits of the ghosts in a different order than the book, with the Ghost of Christmas Present appearing before Past. Tiny Tim resembles UPA&#x27;s character Gerald McBoing-Boing 

The special was rerun on NBC throughout the Christmas season until 1969. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, it aired on local stations in syndication during the Christmas season, in the 1990s, it aired on the Disney Channel and USA Network, and in the 2000s, it aired on Cartoon Network with the entire song &quot;Winter Was Warm&quot; removed (&quot;The Lord&#x27;s Bright Blessing&quot; replaced its reprised version for the end credits) and other sequences trimmed for time. Me-TV brought it back to broadcast television in 2011. NBC aired the special again in 2012, with scenes depicting Magoo in the framing device cut in order to make room for commercials. The CW subsequently acquired the broadcast rights to the special; the original special aired in its entirety in 2014, but the NBC version aired the following year. Distribution rights to the special are currently held by NBCUniversal Television Distribution following parent company Comcast&#x27;s acquisition of its holder Classic Media, which was renamed DreamWorks Classics.

When it premiered on Freeform on December 13, 2022, several sequences were edited out, including the song &quot;We&#x27;re Despicable (Plunderers&#x27; March) and Magoo &amp; Cratchett&#x27;s duet on &quot;Ringle Ringle&quot;.

==Home media==
The special was first released on VHS, Betamax, and LaserDisc in 1982 by Paramount Home Video on behalf of UPA. The VHS was re-released in 1988 and 1994. The special later made its DVD debut in 2001 by Goodtimes Home Video and had multiple re-releases on the format. On November 16, 2010, it was released on Blu-ray. Most media are labeled as &quot;Mr. Magoo,&quot; though many online resources spell out his name as &quot;Mister Magoo.&quot;

==Reception==
Thomas Vinciguerra for &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the special and gave it a 4.5 out of 5, saying &quot;not merely a superior musical version, it is a pioneer among animated Christmas traditions.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Clips from the special were seen on television monitors in &quot;Scrooged&quot;.

Animal Collective&#x27;s 2000 debut album &quot;Spirit They&#x27;re Gone, Spirit They&#x27;ve Vanished&quot; is named for one of Scrooge&#x27;s lines in the special.

In the &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; episode &quot;Santaclaustrophobia&quot; a clip is seen playing on the television in Sgt. Mick Belker&#x27;s apartment.

The special was parodied as &quot;Mr. McGrew&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; 2003 episode &#x27;Tis the Fifteenth Season&quot;.

The special was shown in the Christmas movie &quot;Surviving Christmas&quot;.

In the 2001 pilot episode of &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, Claire Fisher (Lauren Ambrose) watches a clip from the special.

In the 1988 Christmas episode of the television series &quot;Wonder Years&quot;, set in 1968, Kevin sees a bank of color TV sets all displaying a scene from the special. 

==Stage adaptation==
In 2014, the Actors Fund produced a one night only semi-staged live adaptation of the special at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater at John Jay College. Among the cast included Douglas Sills as Scrooge, Joshua Henry as Bob Cratchit, and Betsy Wolfe as Belle. Musical direction was by John McDaniel, who helped adapt Walter Scharf&#x27;s original orchestrations. Five years later, the Actors Fund once again staged the show at the same theater, this time with Gavin Lee as Scrooge, Clifton Duncan as Bob Cratchit, and Sierra Boggess as Belle.

<doc id="113230" wikidata="Q2176586" url="?curid=113230" title="Volkert van der Graaf">
<text>Volkert van der Graaf (born 9 July 1969) is a Dutch convicted murderer who assassinated politician Pim Fortuyn, the leader of the Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) party, on 6 May 2002. Van der Graaf shot Fortuyn outside a radio studio in Hilversum shortly after Fortuyn gave an interview during the political campaign for the Dutch general election of 2002. An environmental and animal rights activist, Van der Graaf stated at his trial that he killed Fortuyn to stop him from exploiting Muslims as &quot;scapegoats&quot; and targeting &quot;the vulnerable sections of society&quot; in seeking political power. Van der Graaf was arrested shortly after shooting Fortuyn, who died immediately. 

In court, Van der Graaf testified that he had become alarmed that Fortuyn was using Muslims and immigrants as scapegoats in a campaign to seek political power. He thought the politician endangered society with his controversial statements. His trial started on 27 March 2003. He was convicted on 15 April 2003 and sentenced to 18 years in prison. The trial generated large interest from the Dutch public, especially from supporters of Fortuyn. Some Fortuyn supporters and political commentators argued that the political left and the media had created a climate that had enabled Van der Graaf&#x27;s actions through demonising Fortuyn.

After his conviction, Van der Graaf appealed for the reduction of the sentence to 16 years, but on 18 July 2003, the appeals court upheld the previous sentence. He was released on parole in May 2014 after serving 12 years, two-thirds of his sentence, according to Dutch practice. His parole ultimately expired on 30 April 2020, giving release from the remaining restrictions.

==Family life and education==
Van der Graaf was born in Middelburg, in the province of Zeeland. By the time he attended university in Wageningen, he had become a vegan and an advocate of animal rights. At the time of the murder he lived with his girlfriend and their infant daughter in Harderwijk.

==Career==
Van der Graaf worked for the environmental organisation Vereniging Milieu Offensief in Wageningen, which he had co-founded in 1992. His job involved challenging violators of environmental regulations through litigation. He concentrated particularly on contesting practices in intensive animal farming and fur farming. He was said to be highly motivated, working more than the four days per week of his contract. He was successful at litigation, winning about three out of every four cases.

==Murder of Fortuyn==

On 6 May 2002, Pim Fortuyn was shot outside a radio studio in Hilversum at 6:00 pm, just after he finished an interview. He was killed instantly. Interviewer Ruud de Wild witnessed the murder.

Van der Graaf was arrested near the scene of the crime after a pursuit by witnesses. Details of the suspect were always officially reported as &quot;Volkert van der G.&quot;, in accordance with unwritten Dutch privacy practice, but his full name was readily available on the internet. His home and work addresses were soon circulated on web sites used by Fortuyn&#x27;s supporters. Angry supporters gathered in several cities, so several people related to Van der Graaf went into hiding. His girlfriend and their daughter left their house on the evening of the murder.

The details of the murder emerged later; the accounts of the investigators and Van der Graaf were consistent. He had planned the attack using information obtained from the Internet; printouts of a map of the scene of the crime and schedules of Fortuyn&#x27;s appearances were found in his car. In two boxes of cartridges found at his home, seven cartridges were missing, the exact number loaded in his gun. The attack has been described as the work of a single person, an amateur shooter who used a relatively simple plan and did not prepare a good escape route.

Van der Graaf purchased his weapons illegally: a semi-automatic Star Firestar M43 pistol in a café in Ede and 9mm cartridges in The Hague. After the murder of Fortuyn, the gun was linked to a suspect in the robbery of a jeweller in Emmen through DNA material found on the weapon.

On the day of the murder, he attended work in the morning, taking with him a backpack containing the gun, a pair of latex gloves, a baseball cap and a pair of dark glasses. At the end of the morning, he said he was taking the afternoon off on account of the beautiful weather. He drove towards Hilversum, knowing that Fortuyn was due to be interviewed in the radio studio of 3FM in the Media Park. During the trip he stopped several times, among other things to purchase a razor to remove his stubble, which together with the cap and glasses would disguise his appearance, while the gloves would avoid leaving fingerprints. The razor did not work.

He had never visited the Mediapark, relying on a map and a couple of photos to find his way into the park on foot and to the building where Fortuyn&#x27;s interview was held. Recognising Fortuyn&#x27;s car in the car park, he hid in some nearby bushes, burying the gun which was in a plastic bag in a shallow trough in case he was discovered. He could hear fragments of Fortuyn&#x27;s interview from a speaker on the outside of the building. He waited there for about two hours.
Fortuyn emerged from the building in the company of several others, including De Wild. Van der Graaf walked towards Fortuyn, passed by him, then turned and opened fire. He said that he aimed for the back to avoid Fortuyn&#x27;s ducking away or a bullet mistakenly hitting somebody else. He held the gun in both hands, with the plastic bag around it. Less than from Fortuyn, he hit him in the back and head five times, and fired a sixth shot that missed.

Running away, Van der Graaf was chased by Hans Smolders, Fortuyn&#x27;s chauffeur. Two employees from a different building joined in. During the chase, Van der Graaf threatened them by raising the gun in his jacket pocket toward them. They ran from the grounds of the Mediapark onto a public road, where Van der Graaf pointed the pistol at arm&#x27;s length at Smolders, who had been reporting their position to the police by mobile phone. Reaching a gas station, Van der Graaf gave himself up when police pointed their pistols at him.

== Investigations and trial==

=== Initial investigations and conspiracy theories ===
For several months Van der Graaf refused to make any statement about the murder, on the advice of his lawyers. He was represented by Böhler, Koppe and Franken, with Böhler leading.

In the months following the murder, many conspiracy theories were put forth by supporters of Fortuyn and others. Officials investigating the murder dismissed these popular rumours, declaring that no evidence had been found for the involvement of others. No evidence was found to support rumors that Van der Graaf had committed the earlier murder in 1996 of Chris van de Werken, an environmental official from Nunspeet, or that he attended other appearances by Fortuyn.

On 7 July 2006, the national daily newspaper &quot;De Telegraaf&quot; published an article alleging Van der Graaf&#x27;s connection with the murder of Van der Werken. &quot;De Telegraaf&quot; printed extracts of a secret police report on the murder of Van der Werken on its website. Quirijn Meijnen, a Dutch-based media lawyer who represented Van der Graaf, said the accusations were grave and unfounded, and that the publication of extracts of the secret police report infringed Van der Graaf&#x27;s privacy rights. &quot;De Telegraaf&quot; failed to mention that Van der Graaf was never a suspect in the murder case of Van der Werken.

After Van der Graaf&#x27;s arrest, he was held in strict isolation until 1 June. He could speak only to his lawyers and police and justice officials. He was kept under constant observation by video camera.

A second search of Van der Graaf&#x27;s home on 24 June found a chemical mixture, calcium chlorate and sugar, hidden in 35 condoms in his garage. Nearby were flasks of sulphuric acid. Experts said the substances could be combined to make a fire bomb or explosive material. Van der Graaf later said that he had fabricated the materials around 1990–1992 for experimentation purposes and had forgotten about them. Detectives also conducted a search on Graaf&#x27;s personal computer and found he had used the internet to gather information about Fortuyn.

=== First hearing ===
The first &quot;pro forma&quot; hearing in his trial started on 9 August, which Van der Graaf watched on television from his cell in the Bijlmerbajes prison. The prosecution outlined its evidence, which included the finding of DNA matching Fortuyn on Van der Graaf&#x27;s clothes and gun, matching of the bullets used in the attack with the gun, and eyewitnesses who pursued him continuously from the murder scene to the point of arrest. The defence complained that lack of discretion in reporting by the press and statements by public officials would make it difficult to obtain a fair trial. It requested calling as witnesses several politicians who had made public comments about the murder, including the past Prime Ministers Wim Kok and Jan Peter Balkenende, as well as various members of Lijst Pim Fortuyn including Mat Herben and Jim Janssen van Raaij.

On the morning of 3 September, Van der Graaf&#x27;s girlfriend was arrested at her workplace in connection with the chemicals found at their former home. Her lawyer and the lawyers of Van der Graaf denounced this as an attempt to pressure Van der Graaf into making a statement. She was released two days later and eventually cleared of any suspicion after Van der Graaf made a statement on her behalf.

=== Second hearing ===
During a second &quot;pro forma&quot; hearing on 4 November, it was decided that the trial would be delayed while Van der Graaf was sent for seven weeks of psychiatric observation at the Pieter Baan Centre, starting in the first week of January 2003. In a press statement of 23 November, the prosecution (Public Ministry) announced that Van der Graaf had confessed to the murder. He said he planned it for some time and that nobody else was involved in the plans or knew about them. He believed Fortuyn was a steadily increasing danger for vulnerable groups in society. He saw no other possibility than to end the danger by killing Fortuyn.

In response to the confession, Mat Herben said he was still not convinced that Van der Graaf had acted alone. Fortuyn&#x27;s brother Marten said he was not surprised by the confession but feared that Van der Graaf was setting himself up as &quot;saviour of the fatherland&quot;.

The confession has not been made publicly available. Reports have asserted that Van der Graaf said he was &quot;not proud&quot; of the deed. He said if he could consider the decision again, he would not do it. He said that he did not see himself as &quot;the saviour of the Netherlands&quot; or as a martyr.

On 6 January 2003, Van der Graaf was moved to the Pieter Baan Centrum (PBC) to begin the seven-week behavioural investigation. Disagreements between the Ministry of Justice and the management of the PBC over the conditions of his supervision delayed it. The Ministry wanted Van der Graaf under video surveillance 24 hours per day and isolated from other patients for his own safety. The PBC believed such cameras would prevent establishing the trust needed for the multi-disciplinary behavioural investigation. It took responsibility to supervise him in a small group so that the investigation could proceed optimally. On 20 January, Van der Graaf said he was suspending his cooperation for the investigation. The Minister of Justice, Piet Hein Donner, resolved the dispute by dropping the demands for video surveillance and isolation.

=== Third hearing ===
On 29 January 2003, a third &quot;pro forma&quot; hearing was held in which the dates for the trial were set. Since the subject of the trial was expected to be not so much the question of the guilt of Van der Graaf, but instead the degree of the punishment, the report of the Pieter Baan Centrum was considered highly significant, in case it found that he was of &quot;diminished responsibilities&quot;. After the completion of the investigation on 14 March, he was returned to his prison cell in the Bijlmerbajes.

The report from the PBC was complete by about 21 March. It found that Van der Graaf could be held completely accountable for the killing. The report also stated that Van der Graaf has a severe personality disorder, which explains his rigid moral judgements. Menno Oosterhoff, a child psychiatrist from Groningen, publicly suggested that the Pieter Baan Centrum may have overlooked the possibility that Van der Graaf has Asperger syndrome; Oosterhoff later withdrew his theory. The PBC report stated that nothing could be said about the chance of another similar crime occurring, since the disorder had nothing to do with the murder. Van der Graaf agreed that he was accountable and that he had compulsive urges. The outcome of the investigation ensured that he would receive a prison sentence and not &quot;TBS treatment&quot;.

=== The trial ===

The trial was held in a high-security court in Amsterdam-Osdorp over three days: 27 March, 31 March, and 1 April. About 15 supporters of Fortuyn demonstrated outside the building, with banners such as &quot;for less than 20 years we will smash the place up&quot;, &quot;better Fortuynist than socialist&quot; and &quot;the leftist church is criminal&quot;. The proceedings were followed by about 80 people, including a woman who disturbed the occasion by screaming at Van der Graaf, accusing him of such things as &quot;destroying the whole of the Netherlands&quot;. Van der Graaf was counseled by the high-profile German-born attorney, Britta Böhler.

Van der Graaf was charged with the premeditated murder of Fortuyn, two counts of possession of illegal weapons, namely the gun and the explosive mixture at his house, and a charge of threatening the life of Fortuyn&#x27;s chauffeur by pointing his gun at him during the chase following the murder.

The prosecutor asked for life imprisonment for the killing, saying that an example must be set for anybody else attempting to frustrate the democratic process through criminal means. He said the crime was serious because of its victim and the consequences, and that to a certain degree it was a &quot;political murder&quot;. Van der Graaf had irrevocably damaged the democratic political progress of Fortuyn, and had done it intentionally. For an exceptional crime, he deserved an exceptional punishment.

During the trial, Van der Graaf described his reasons for killing Fortuyn. He claimed he hoped that the leaders of other political parties would criticize Fortuyn, but that it never happened (which was not true as other party leaders had openly criticized and derided Fortuyn in debates). He claimed that Fortuyn had the talent to channel criticism so that it never touched him. Van der Graaf said he had spoken to no one about his plan. He finished his planning just the day before the murder. Perhaps looking for sympathy, he said he was wrestling with regret for the killing, finding the killing of somebody morally reprehensible. On 6 May he had felt justified, saying that he wanted to fight the danger of what Fortuyn represented, not the man. He did not find it easy to talk about feelings. Asked about the danger of accidentally injuring somebody other than Fortuyn in the attack, he said that he had been confident that that would not happen. However, the 3FM disc jockey Ruud de Wild said that he barely escaped with his life, as he received a bullet in the bag used for a shield. De Wild also stated that witnessing the shooting had left him suffering from PTSD.

To the argument that Fortuyn would have been chosen through democratic means, Van der Graaf said that that was also the case for Hitler. He compared the rise of Fortuyn to the rise of Nazism in the 1930s. In his final argument, he said that he had acted from his conscience, but that did not justify murder. He said it was absolutely not normal to shoot somebody to death.

Van der Graaf said he murdered Fortuyn to defend Dutch Muslims from persecution. He wanted to stop Fortuyn from targeting &quot;the weak parts of society to score points&quot; and exploiting Muslims as &quot;scapegoats&quot; in an attempt to seek political power.

Van der Graaf said that he would not have committed the murder, at least not on that evening, if Fortuyn had been accompanied by security guards; this is relevant to accusations that the government should have provided security. On Tuesday, 15 April 2003, Van der Graaf was convicted and sentenced to 18 years&#x27; imprisonment.

=== Appeals ===
The prosecution and the defence both made appeals against the sentence. Prior to the appeal, suggestions in the media that Van der Graaf may have had Asperger syndrome were rejected by workers at the PBC. They said they had considered and rejected the possibility. A psychiatric report read in court said that Van der Graaf had an obsessive compulsive personality but was sane and could be held accountable for his actions. The prosecution argued that the court had not taken account of the political nature of the murder, and asked again for life imprisonment. The defence argued that the sentence did not take account of the harsh conditions under which Van der Graaf had been held, nor the damage that had been done by unsubstantiated allegations that had appeared in the media (such as the connection with Van der Werken), and requested a reduction in sentence to 16 years. The appeals court accepted some of the arguments from both parties, but on 18 July 2003 reiterated the sentence to 18 years&#x27; imprisonment.

== Release ==

Van der Graaf was released on parole on 2 May 2014, after having served two-thirds of his sentence as required by Dutch law. The conditions of his parole were: weekly reporting to the probation service; a ban on visiting the places of residence of relatives of the victim or the municipal areas of Rotterdam, Hilversum and The Hague; location monitoring with an ankle bracelet with GPS; a ban on contacting the relatives of Fortuyn; a ban on communicating with the media; and compulsory meetings with a psychologist or psychiatrist. He subsequently settled in Apeldoorn. A public protest against Van der Graaf&#x27;s release was organised in Rotterdam by former LPF politicians including Hans Smolders and members of Fortuyn&#x27;s family.

In July 2014, his lawyer Stijn Franken started legal proceedings against the terms of the parole. Van der Graaf was interested in becoming a legal advisor, and the restriction on visiting The Hague was unreasonable when so many legal organisations are based there. He also claimed that the restriction on communicating with the press was a violation of free speech, and that this and other restrictions were unnecessary when experts had found the risk of recidivism to be extremely low. He was partially successful, in that the travel restrictions and the ankle bracelet conditions were removed, but the media ban remained to &quot;prevent unnecessary social unrest&quot;. The government appealed the judgement, but it was upheld.

In 2017, Van der Graaf faced another court case in which the public prosecutor asked that he be returned to prison for a year for failing to sufficiently answer questions at probation meetings. However, on 6 February 2017 the court found that he had sufficiently met his probation requirements by appearing at the meetings.

In 2018, Van der Graaf again took legal action against the government over the terms of his parole, saying that the parole hearings prevented him from emigrating. The court ruled in his favour, and an appeal was withdrawn after a new arrangement was made: that Van der Graaf would report by email once every two months, until April 2020. As of May 2019, he was still resident in Apeldoorn.

His parole expired on 30 April 2020, giving release from the remaining restrictions.

<doc id="113231" wikidata="Q214913" url="?curid=113231" title="Leticia, Amazonas">
<text>Leticia () is the southernmost city in the Republic of Colombia, capital of the department of Amazonas, Colombia&#x27;s southernmost town (4.09° south 69.57° west) and one of the major ports on the Amazon River. It has an elevation of 96 meters (315&#x27;) above sea level and an average temperature of 27 °C (80.6 °F). Leticia has long been Colombia&#x27;s shipping point for tropical fish for the aquarium trade. Leticia has a population of 33,503 located on the left bank of the Amazon River at the point where the borders of Colombia, Brazil and Peru meet in an area called Tres Fronteras.

A long-standing border dispute involving Leticia, between Colombia and Peru, was decided in 1934 by the League of Nations after these two nations were engulfed in an armed conflict known as the Colombia-Peru War. It is adjacent to the larger Brazilian city of Tabatinga. Together with the Peruvian city of Santa Rosa de Yavari, the entire urban area has more than 120,000 residents spread along the Amazon River

== History ==

=== Early history and etymology ===
Early Leticia history mentions a Portuguese explorer who, after becoming lost in the Amazon, died of starvation at the present site of Leticia with the rest of his crew. The Peruvian captain Benigno Bustamante, then governor of the Peruvian department of Loreto, founded the city itself on April 25, 1867. Legend has it that when the Peruvian government decided to colonise the area (in order to prevent the Colombian government from claiming it first), they found a cross inscribed with the words &quot;San Antonio&quot;, naming the new town after this cross.

A legend states that a Colombian soldier fell in love with an Amerindian woman named Leticia and decided to name the settlement after her. It could also have been named after Saint Leticia. However, Peruvian records indicate that on the 15 December 1867, the port of &quot;San Antonio&quot; was renamed to &quot;Leticia&quot; by Peruvian engineer Manuel Charón. Charón named the port in honor of a young female resident of the Peruvian city of Iquitos named Leticia Smith, who in fact, was his wife.

=== Territorial dispute ===
Small border incidents between Peru and Colombia occurred in 1911, and in 1922 the two governments of those countries reached a controversial agreement awarding the Leticia area to Colombia in exchange for recognizing Peru&#x27;s rights to the zone south of the Putumayo River, which was also claimed by Ecuador. This agreement proved to be unpopular among the Peruvian population, despite the treaty&#x27;s ratification in 1928, because the treaty was signed in secret and it awarded Colombia a region that had been founded by Peruvians and that had a large Peruvian population living within its borders.

The Colombia-Peru War began in September 1932 when two hundred Peruvians, followed later by military troops, occupied public buildings in Leticia, which was not garrisoned. Hand-to-hand combat ensued between small Colombian and Peruvian forces in early 1933. The conflict lasted until May 1933, when a cease-fire negotiated by the League of Nations went into effect in order to settle the conflict. The League finally awarded the disputed area to Colombia in June 1934.

=== Recent history ===
Though the League of Nations&#x27; intervention had officially ended the war, the Colombian government remained wary of the Peruvians, and decided to populate Leticia with people from Bogotá in order to ensure the town&#x27;s loyalty to Colombia. Most of the people who came from Bogotá from the 1940s to 1965 still live in Leticia . During that time Leticia has expanded greatly, with a new main street being built. However, the city&#x27;s industries have changed little since then, with agriculture and tourism still the prime sources of income.

Tourism in Leticia has boomed and the town is today a recognized tourist site. International students travel to Leticia to learn Spanish. Meanwhile, students and visitors can enjoy the attractions nearby the city.

== Climate ==
Leticia features a tropical rainforest climate with minimal difference in average high and low temperatures throughout the course of the year. Leticia does have noticeably wetter and drier months, with its wettest month (March) seeing a little more than twice as much rain as its driest month (July). The average monthly rainfall in the city is consistently above .

== Biodiversity ==

The frog fauna of Leticia is highly species rich. An intensive survey effort in primary rainforest and flooded forest some 10 km (6 miles) north of Leticia revealed 96 frog species (with two more found shortly afterwards). However, the true number might be as high as 123 species, based on species expected to occur in the area but not yet documented there.

== Culture ==

=== People ===
The majority of Leticia&#x27;s population have migrated from elsewhere. There is no obviously dominant segment, but migrants from Bogotá, Medellín, and Tolima are the majority. Few people from Cali live in Leticia. A significant proportion of Leticia&#x27;s population comprises native Amerindians (as opposed to &quot;mestizos&quot; or &quot;caboclos&quot;). The prevailing trend is for people to move from the village of their birth in far-lying rural communities into the city to make a &quot;better&quot; living.

The region is home to several indigenous people, including the Witoto, Inga, Tucano, Ticuna, and Nukak. The Peruvian Yagua settled in the riverside village of La Libertad in the 1990s.

=== Food ===
Although the inhabitants commonly eat the same things each week, a wide variety of food is available in Leticia. Dishes specific to each of Colombia&#x27;s regions are made here. For example, people make Sancocho, a hearty soup, with regional variations in different parts of Colombia. But even within regions, each family has its own recipe. Leticia&#x27;s cuisine includes Brazilian and Peruvian influences. Common staples in Leticia include river fish, domestic (and occasionally wild) meat, rice, locally-grown vegetables and potatoes. Meals are usually cooked over a wood-fired stovetop in a pan. A typical Sunday meal might comprise grilled meats, cooked in makeshift charcoal grillers, served with rice and plantains.

=== Education ===
Leticia is considered an important area for the study of the Amazon and its biodiversity.

== Transportation ==
The Vásquez Cobo International Airport in Leticia is the largest airport in the south of Colombia. In addition to being the Colombian jungle region gateway, it also serves as the major airport in the triple-border region (Colombia, Brazil and Peru). For this reason, the airport handles the majority of passengers from the central Amazon region.

The city is not connected to the bulk of Colombia by road.

<doc id="113232" wikidata="Q229398" url="?curid=113232" title="Three-dimensional chess">
<text>Three-dimensional chess (or 3‑D chess) is any chess variant that replaces the two-dimensional board with a three-dimensional array of cells between which the pieces can move. In practice, this is usually achieved by boards representing different layers being laid out next to each other. Three-dimensional chess has often appeared in science fiction—the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise in particular—contributing to the game&#x27;s familiarity.

Three-dimensional variants have existed since at least the late 19th century, one of the oldest being Raumschach (German for &quot;Space chess&quot;), invented in 1907 by Ferdinand Maack and considered the classic 3‑D game. Chapter 25 of David Pritchard&#x27;s &quot;The Classified Encyclopedia of Chess Variants&quot; discusses some 50 such variations extending chess to three dimensions as well as a handful of higher-dimensional variants. Chapter 11 covers variants using multiple boards normally set side by side which can also be considered to add an extra dimension to chess.

The expression &quot;three-dimensional chess&quot; is sometimes used as a colloquial metaphor to describe complex, dynamic systems with many competing entities and interests, including politics, diplomacy and warfare. To describe an individual as &quot;playing three-dimensional chess&quot; implies a higher-order understanding and mastery of the system beyond the comprehension of their peers or ordinary observers, who are implied to be &quot;playing&quot; regular chess.

==Kubikschach==
Lionel Kieseritzky (1806–1853) developed Kubikschach (German for &quot;Cube chess&quot;) in 1851. He used an 8×8×8 board, labelling the third dimension with Greek letters alpha through theta. This format was later picked up by Maack in 1907 when developing Raumschach. According to David Pritchard, this format is: [...] the most popular 3‑D board amongst inventors, and at the same time the most mentally indigestible for the players ... Less demanding on spatial vision, and hence more practical, are those games confined to three 8×8 boards and games with boards smaller than 8×8.

==Raumschach==
Ferdinand Maack (1861–1930) developed Raumschach (German for &quot;Space chess&quot;) in 1907. He contended that for chess to be more like modern warfare, attack should be possible not only from a two-dimensional plane but also from above (aerial) and below (underwater). Maack&#x27;s original formulation was for an 8×8×8 board, but after experimenting with smaller boards eventually settled on 5×5×5 as best. Other obvious differences from standard chess include two additional pawns per player, and a special piece (two per player) named &quot;unicorn&quot;.

===Board===
The Raumschach 3‑D board can be thought of as a cube sliced into five equal spaces across each of its three major coordinal planes. This sectioning yields a 5×5×5 (125 cube) gamespace. The cubes (usually represented by squares and often called &quot;cells&quot;) alternate in color in all three dimensions.

The horizontal levels are denoted by capital letters A through E. Ranks and files of a level are denoted using algebraic notation. White starts on the A and B levels and Black starts on E and D. 

===Rules===
White moves first. The game objective, as in standard chess, is checkmate. Rooks, bishops, and knights move as they do in chess in any given plane.
&#x27;

==&quot;Star Trek&quot; Tri-Dimensional Chess== 

&quot;Tri-Dimensional Chess&quot;, &quot;Tri-D Chess&quot;, or &quot;Three-Dimensional Chess&quot; is a chess variant which can be seen in many &quot;Star Trek&quot; TV episodes and movies, starting with the original series (TOS) and proceeding in updated forms throughout the subsequent movies and spinoff series.

The original &quot;Star Trek&quot; prop was crafted using boards from 3D Checkers and 3D Tic-Tac-Toe sets available in stores at the time (games also seen in TOS episodes) and adding chess pieces from the futuristic-looking &quot;Classic&quot; chess set designed by Peter Ganine in 1961. The design retained the 64 squares of a traditional chessboard, but distributed them onto separate platforms in a hierarchy of spatial levels, suggesting to audiences how chess adapted to a future predominated by space travel. Rules for the game were never invented within the series – in fact, the boards are sometimes not even aligned consistently from one scene to the next within a single episode.

The Tri-D chessboard was further realized by its inclusion in the &quot;Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual&quot; by Franz Joseph, who created starting positions for the pieces and short, additional rules.

===Rules development===
The complete Standard Rules for the game were originally developed in 1976 by Andrew Bartmess (with encouragement from Joseph) and were subsequently expanded by him into a commercially available booklet. A free summary in English of the Standard Rules is contained on Charles Roth&#x27;s website, including omissions and ambiguities regarding piece moves across the four Tri‑D gameboard 2×2 &quot;attack boards&quot;.

A complete set of tournament rules for Tri-Dimensional Chess written by Jens Meder is available on his website. Meder&#x27;s rules are based on FIDE&#x27;s rules more than Andrew Bartmess&#x27; Standard Rules, with some deviations too. A repository of Tournament Rules games can be found on the website of Michael Klein.

===Board details===

Plans for constructing a Tri‑D chessboard can be found on &quot;The Chess Variant Pages&quot;, as well as in Bartmess&#x27; &quot;Tri‑D Chess Rules&quot;. Details for building a travel-size board are included on Meder&#x27;s website.

===Software===
There is software for playing Tri‑D Chess. &quot;Parmen&quot; (possibly named after a lead character in the episode &quot;Plato&#x27;s Stepchildren&quot;) is a Windows application written by Doug Keenan and available free on his website. A free Android version of Tri‑D Chess is offered by AwfSoft.

==Other three-dimensional chess variants==
*Alice chess – two adjacent 8×8 boards
*Cubic chess – a 6×6×6 variant
*Dragonchess – three stacked 8×12 boards, a fantasy variant
*Flying chess – two adjacent 8×8 boards
*Millennium 3D chess – an 8×8×3 variant retaining most of the rules of standard chess
*Parallel worlds chess – an 8×8×3 variant with two armies per player
*Space shogi – a 9×9×9 shogi variant
==In fiction==
As well as in &quot;Star Trek&quot;, multi-dimensional chess games are featured in various fictional works, usually in a futuristic or science fiction setting. Examples include Pebble in the Sky by Isaac Asimov, Legend of the Galactic Heroes, &quot;Nova&quot;, &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;, &quot;UFO&quot;, &quot;Starman Jones&quot;, &quot;Unreal 2&quot;, the Legion of Super-Heroes franchise, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, and &quot;The Lego Movie&quot;. The concept is parodied in &quot;Futurama&quot; as &quot;tridimensional &quot;Scrabble&quot;&quot;.

<doc id="113240" wikidata="Q661045" url="?curid=113240" title="Ventriloquism">
<text>Ventriloquism or ventriloquy is an act of stagecraft in which a person (a ventriloquist) speaks in such a way that it looks like their voice is coming from a different location, usually through a puppet known as a &quot;dummy&quot;. The act of ventriloquism is ventriloquizing, and in English it is commonly called the ability to &quot;throw&quot; one&#x27;s voice.

==History==

===Origins===
Originally, ventriloquism was a religious practice. The name comes from the Latin for &#x27;to speak from the stomach: (belly) and (speak). The Greeks called this engastromythia (). The noises produced by the stomach were thought to be the voices of the unliving, who took up residence in the stomach of the ventriloquist. The ventriloquist would then interpret the sounds, as they were thought to be able to speak to the dead, as well as foretell the future. One of the earliest recorded group of prophets to use this technique was the Pythia, the priestess at the temple of Apollo in Delphi, who acted as the conduit for the Delphic Oracle.

One of the most successful early gastromancers was Eurykles, a prophet at Athens; gastromancers came to be referred to as &quot;Euryklides&quot; in his honour. Other parts of the world also have a tradition of ventriloquism for ritual or religious purposes; historically there have been adepts of this practice among the Zulu, Inuit, and Māori peoples.

===Emergence as entertainment===
The shift from ventriloquism as manifestation of spiritual forces toward ventriloquism as entertainment happened in the eighteenth century at travelling funfairs and market towns. An early depiction of a ventriloquist dates to 1754 in England, where Sir John Parnell is depicted in the painting &quot;An Election Entertainment&quot; by William Hogarth as speaking via his hand. In 1757, the Austrian Baron de Mengen performed with a small doll.

By the late 18th century, ventriloquist performances were an established form of entertainment in England, although most performers &quot;threw their voice&quot; to make it appear that it emanated from far away (known as &quot;distant ventriloquism&quot;), rather than the modern method of using a puppet (&quot;near ventriloquism&quot;). A well-known ventriloquist of the period, Joseph Askins, who performed at the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre in London in the 1790s advertised his act as &quot;curious ad libitum Dialogues between himself and his invisible familiar, Little Tommy&quot;. However, other performers were beginning to incorporate dolls or puppets into their performance, notably the Irishman James Burne who &quot;carries in his pocket, an ill-shaped doll, with a broad face, which he exhibits ... as giving utterance to his own childish jargon,&quot; and Thomas Garbutt.

The entertainment came of age during the era of the music hall in the United Kingdom and vaudeville in the United States. George Sutton began to incorporate a puppet act into his routine at Nottingham in the 1830s, followed by Fred Neiman later in the century, but it is Fred Russell who is regarded as the father of modern ventriloquism. In 1886, he was offered a professional engagement at the Palace Theatre in London and took up his stage career permanently. His act, based on the cheeky-boy dummy &quot;Coster Joe&quot; that would sit in his lap and &#x27;engage in a dialogue&#x27; with him was highly influential for the entertainment format and was adopted by the next generation of performers. A blue plaque has been embedded in a former residence of Russell by the British Heritage Society which reads &#x27;Fred Russell the father of ventriloquism lived here&#x27;.
Fred Russell&#x27;s successful comedy team format was applied by the next generation of ventriloquists. It was taken forward by the British Arthur Prince with his dummy Sailor Jim, who became one of the highest paid entertainers on the music hall circuit, and by the Americans The Great Lester, Frank Byron Jr., and Edgar Bergen. Bergen, together with his favorite figure Charlie McCarthy, hosted a radio program that was broadcast from 1937 to 1956 and which was #1 on the nights it aired, popularizing the idea of the comedic ventriloquist. Bergen continued performing until his death in 1978, and his popularity inspired many other famous ventriloquists who followed him, including Paul Winchell, Jimmy Nelson, David Strassman, Jeff Dunham, Terry Fator, Ronn Lucas, Wayland Flowers, Shari Lewis, Willie Tyler, Jay Johnson, Nina Conti, Paul Zerdin, and Darci Lynne. Another ventriloquist act popular in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s was Señor Wences.

In south India, the art of ventriloquism was popularized by Y. K. Padhye and M. M. Roy, who are believed to be the pioneers of this field in India. Y. K. Padhye&#x27;s son Ramdas Padhye borrowed from him and made the art popular amongst the masses through his performance on television. Ramdas Padhye&#x27;s name is synonymous with puppet characters like Ardhavatrao (also known as Mr. Crazy), Tatya Vinchu and Bunny the Funny which features in a television advertisement for Lijjat Papad, an Indian snack. Ramdas Padhye&#x27;s son Satyajit Padhye is also a ventriloquist.

The popularity of ventriloquism fluctuates. Comedian Jeff Dunham has been credited with reviving the artform and is said to done more promoting it than anyone since Edgar Bergen. In the UK in 2010, there were only 15 full-time professional ventriloquists, down from around 400 in the 1950s and 1960s. A number of modern ventriloquists have developed a following as the public taste for live comedy grows. In 2007, Zillah &amp; Totte won the first season of &quot;Sweden&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; and became one of Sweden&#x27;s most popular family/children entertainers. A feature-length documentary about ventriloquism, &quot;I&#x27;m No Dummy&quot;, was released in 2010. Three ventriloquists have won &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;: Terry Fator in 2007, Paul Zerdin in 2015 and Darci Lynne in 2017. Two ventriloquists, Damien James and Christine Barger, have appeared on &quot;Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us&quot;. Several ventriloquists have grown large followings on popular social media apps, as well.

==Vocal technique==
One difficulty ventriloquists face is that all the sounds that they make must be made with lips slightly separated. For the labial sounds &quot;f&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, and &quot;m&quot;, the only choice is to replace them with others. A widely parodied example of this difficulty is the &quot;gottle o&#x27; gear&quot;, from the reputed inability of less-skilled practitioners to pronounce &quot;bottle of beer&quot;. If variations of the sounds &quot;th&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, and &quot;n&quot; are spoken quickly, it can be difficult for listeners to notice a difference.

==Ventriloquist&#x27;s dummy==
Modern ventriloquists use multiple types of puppets in their presentations, ranging from soft cloth or foam puppets (Verna Finly&#x27;s work is a pioneering example), flexible latex puppets (such as Steve Axtell&#x27;s creations) and the traditional and familiar hard-headed knee figure (Tim Selberg&#x27;s mechanized carvings). The classic dummies used by ventriloquists (the technical name for which is ventriloquial figure) vary in size anywhere from twelve inches tall to human-size and larger, with the height usually . Traditionally, this type of puppet has been made from papier-mâché or wood. In modern times, other materials are often employed, including fiberglass-reinforced resins, urethanes, filled (rigid) latex, and neoprene. Traditionally, the ventriloquist’s dummy is given a flippant personality who unapologetically insults their ventriloquist and often members of the audience as well.

Great names in the history of dummy making include Jeff Dunham, Frank Marshall (the Chicago creator of Bergen&#x27;s Charlie McCarthy, Nelson&#x27;s Danny O&#x27;Day, and Winchell&#x27;s Jerry Mahoney), Theo Mack and Son (Mack carved Charlie McCarthy&#x27;s head), Revello Petee, Kenneth Spencer, Cecil Gough, and Glen &amp; George McElroy. The McElroy brothers&#x27; figures are still considered by many ventriloquists as the apex of complex movement mechanics, with as many as fifteen facial and head movements controlled by interior finger keys and switches. Jeff Dunham referred to his McElroy figure Skinny Duggan as &quot;the Stradivarius of dummies.&quot; The Juro Novelty Company also manufactured dummies. Geoffrey Moran of Australia has built foam puppets Koala (Kevin) and Billy Baby. He has also built a wooden Irish Dancing Donut puppet along with Plunger the pull apart puppet, Ernie (from Tasmania) and Siegfried the World&#x27;s Greatest Marching Band Leader. Other puppets, such as George, Darryl the Dinosaur, Goggles the bird, Barry the Box and Bruce the Robotic Bucket have been made by other associates.

=== Phobia ===

The plots of some films and television programs are based on &quot;killer toy&quot; dummies that are alive and horrific. These include &quot;The Dummy&quot;, a May 4, 1962 episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;; &quot;Devil Doll&quot;; &quot;Dead Silence&quot;; &quot;Zapatlela&quot;; &quot;Buffy The Vampire Slayer&quot;; &quot;Goosebumps&quot;; &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;; &quot;Gotham&quot; (the episode &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot;); &quot;Friday the 13th: The Series&quot;; &quot;Toy Story 4&quot;; and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in different episodes. This genre has also been satirized on television in &quot;ALF&quot; (the episode &quot;I&#x27;m Your Puppet&quot;); &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (the episode &quot;The Chicken Roaster&quot;); and the comic strip &quot;Monty&quot;.

Some psychological horror films and other works feature psychotic ventriloquists who believe their dummies are alive and use them as surrogates to commit frightening acts including murder. Examples of this include the 1978 film &quot;Magic&quot;, the 1945 anthology film &quot;Dead of Night&quot;, and the Ventriloquist from Batman comics and other Batman media.

Literary examples of frightening ventriloquist dummies include Gerald Kersh&#x27;s &quot;The Horrible Dummy&quot; and the story &quot;The Glass Eye&quot; by John Keir Cross. In music, NRBQ&#x27;s video for their song &quot;Dummy&quot; (2004) features four ventriloquist dummies modelled after the band members who &#x27;lip-sync&#x27; the song while wandering around a dark, abandoned house.

<text>The Countryside Council for Wales (CCW; ) was a Welsh Assembly sponsored body responsible for wildlife conservation, landscape and countryside access in Wales.

It merged with Forestry Commission Wales, and Environment Agency Wales to form Natural Resources Wales, a single body managing Wales&#x27; environment and natural resources, on 1 April 2013.

As a statutory advisory and prosecuting body, the Countryside Council for Wales claims to have &#x27;championed the environment and landscapes of Wales and its coastal waters as sources of natural and cultural riches, as a foundation for economic and social activity, and as a place for leisure and learning opportunities&#x27;. Its aim was to &#x27;make the environment a valued part of everyone&#x27;s life in Wales&#x27;.

Likewise, it is the primary language of the Pashtun diaspora around the world. The total number of Pashto-speakers is at least 40 million, although some estimates place it as high as 60 million. Pashto is &quot;one of the primary markers of ethnic identity&quot; amongst Pashtuns.

==Geographic distribution==

A national language of Afghanistan, Pashto is primarily spoken in the east, south, and southwest, but also in some northern and western parts of the country. The exact number of speakers is unavailable, but different estimates show that Pashto is the mother tongue of 45–60% of the total population of Afghanistan.

In Pakistan, Pashto is spoken by % of its population, mainly in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and northern districts of Balochistan province. It is also spoken in parts of Mianwali and Attock districts of the Punjab province, areas of Gilgit-Baltistan and in Islamabad. Pashto speakers are found in other major cities of Pakistan, most notably Karachi, Sindh, which may have the largest Pashtun population of any city in the world.

Other communities of Pashto speakers are found in India, Tajikistan, and northeastern Iran (primarily in South Khorasan Province to the east of Qaen, near the Afghan border). In India most ethnic Pashtun (Pathan) peoples speak the geographically native Hindi-Urdu language rather than Pashto, but there are small numbers of Pashto speakers, such as the Sheen Khalai in Rajasthan, and the Pathan community in the city of Kolkata, often nicknamed the &quot;Kabuliwala&quot; (&quot;people of Kabul&quot;). Pashtun diaspora communities in other countries around the world speak Pashto, especially the sizable communities in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.

===Afghanistan===
Pashto is one of the two official languages of Afghanistan, along with Dari Persian. Since the early 18th century, the monarchs of Afghanistan have been ethnic Pashtuns (except for Habibullāh Kalakāni in 1929). Persian, the literary language of the royal court, was more widely used in government institutions, while the Pashtun tribes spoke Pashto as their native tongue. King Amanullah Khan began promoting Pashto during his reign (1926–1929) as a marker of ethnic identity and as a symbol of &quot;official nationalism&quot; leading Afghanistan to independence after the defeat of the British Empire in the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919. In the 1930s, a movement began to take hold to promote Pashto as a language of government, administration, and art with the establishment of a Pashto Society &quot;Pashto Anjuman&quot; in 1931 and the inauguration of the Kabul University in 1932 as well as the formation of the Pashto Academy (Pashto &quot;Tolana)&quot; in 1937. Muhammad Na&#x27;im Khan, the minister of education between 1938 and 1946, inaugurated the formal policy of promoting Pashto as Afghanistan&#x27;s national language, leading to the commission and publication of Pashto textbooks. The Pashto Tolana was later incorporated into the Academy of Sciences Afghanistan in line with Soviet model following the Saur Revolution in 1978.

Although officially supporting the use of Pashto, the Afghan elite regarded Persian as a &quot;sophisticated language and a symbol of cultured upbringing&quot;. King Zahir Shah (reigning 1933–1973) thus followed suit after his father Nadir Khan had decreed in 1933 that officials were to study and utilize both Persian and Pashto. In 1936 a royal decree of Zahir Shah formally granted Pashto the status of an official language, with full rights to use in all aspects of government and education – despite the fact that the ethnically Pashtun royal family and bureaucrats mostly spoke Persian. Thus Pashto became a national language, a symbol for Pashtun nationalism.

The constitutional assembly reaffirmed the status of Pashto as an official language in 1964 when Afghan Persian was officially renamed to Dari. The lyrics of the national anthem of Afghanistan are in Pashto.

===Pakistan===
In British India, prior to the creation of Pakistan by the British government, the 1920s saw the blossoming of Pashto language in the then NWFP: Abdul Ghafar Khan in 1921 established the &quot;Anjuman-e- Islah al-Afaghina&quot; (Society for the Reformation of Afghans) to promote Pashto as an extension of Pashtun culture; around 80,000 people attended the Society&#x27;s annual meeting in 1927. In 1955, Pashtun intellectuals including Abdul Qadir formed the Pashto Academy Peshawar on the model of Pashto Tolana formed in Afghanistan. In 1974, the Department of Pashto was established in the University of Balochistan for the promotion of Pashto.

In Pakistan, Pashto is the first language around of % of its population (per the 1998 census). However, Urdu and English are the two official languages of Pakistan. Pashto has no official status at the federal level. On a provincial level, Pashto is the regional language of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and north Balochistan. Yet, the primary medium of education in government schools in Pakistan is Urdu.

The lack of importance given to Pashto and its neglect has caused growing resentment amongst Pashtuns. It is noted that Pashto is taught poorly in schools in Pakistan. Moreover, in government schools material is not provided for in the Pashto dialect of that locality, Pashto being a dialectically rich language. Further, researchers have observed that Pashtun students are unable to fully comprehend educational material in Urdu.

Professor Tariq Rahman states:Robert Nicols states:

Although Pashto used as a medium of instruction in schools for Pashtun students results in better understanding and comprehension for students when compared to using Urdu, still the government of Pakistan has only introduced Pashto at the primary levels in state-run schools. Taimur Khan remarks: &quot;the dominant Urdu language squeezes and denies any space for Pashto language in the official and formal capacity. In this contact zone, Pashto language exists but in a subordinate and unofficial capacity&quot;.

==History==
Some linguists have argued that Pashto is descended from Avestan or a variety very similar to it, while others have attempted to place it closer to Bactrian. However, neither position is universally agreed upon. What scholars do agree on is the fact that Pashto is an Eastern Iranian language sharing characteristics with Eastern Middle Iranian languages such as Bactrian, Khwarezmian and Sogdian.

Compare with other Eastern Iranian Languages and Old Avestan:

Strabo, who lived between 64 BC and 24 CE, explains that the tribes inhabiting the lands west of the Indus River were part of Ariana. This was around the time when the area inhabited by the Pashtuns was governed by the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. From the 3rd century CE onward, they are mostly referred to by the name &quot;Afghan&quot; (&quot;Abgan&quot;).

Abdul Hai Habibi believed that the earliest modern Pashto work dates back to Amir Kror Suri of the early Ghurid period in the 8th century, and they use the writings found in Pata Khazana. Pə́ṭa Xazāná () is a Pashto manuscript claimed to be written by Mohammad Hotak under the patronage of the Pashtun emperor Hussain Hotak in Kandahar; containing an anthology of Pashto poets. However, its authenticity is disputed by scholars such as David Neil MacKenzie and Lucia Serena Loi. Nile Green comments in this regard:

From the 16th century, Pashto poetry become very popular among the Pashtuns. Some of those who wrote in Pashto are Bayazid Pir Roshan (a major inventor of the Pashto alphabet), Khushal Khan Khattak, Rahman Baba, Nazo Tokhi, and Ahmad Shah Durrani, founder of the modern state of Afghanistan or the Durrani Empire. The Pashtun literary tradition grew in the backdrop to weakening Pashtun power following Mughal rule: Khushal Khan Khattak used Pashto poetry to rally for Pashtun unity and Pir Bayazid as an expedient means to spread his message to the Pashtun masses.

For instance Khushal Khattak laments in :

==Grammar==

Pashto is a subject–object–verb (SOV) language with split ergativity. In Pashto, this means that the verb agrees with the subject in transitive and intransitive sentences in non-past, non-completed clauses, but when a completed action is reported in any of the past tenses, the verb agrees with the subject if it is intransitive, but with the object if it is transitive. Verbs are inflected for present, simple past, past progressive, present perfect, and past perfect tenses. There is also an inflection for the subjunctive mood.

Nouns and adjectives are inflected for two genders (masculine and feminine), two numbers (singular and plural), and four cases (direct, oblique, ablative, and vocative). The possessor precedes the possessed in the genitive construction, and adjectives come before the nouns they modify.

Unlike most other Indo-Iranian languages, Pashto uses all three types of adpositions—prepositions, postpositions, and circumpositions.

==Phonology==
===Vowels===
===Consonants===

==Vocabulary==

In Pashto, most of the native elements of the lexicon are related to other Eastern Iranian languages. As noted by Josef Elfenbein, &quot;Loanwords have been traced in Pashto as far back as the third century B.C., and include words from Greek and probably Old Persian&quot;. For instance, Georg Morgenstierne notes the Pashto word i.e. &quot;a hand-mill&quot; as being derived from the Ancient Greek word (, i.e. a device). Post-7th century borrowings came primarily from Persian and Hindi-Urdu, with Arabic words being borrowed through Persian, but sometimes directly. Modern speech borrows words from English, French, and German.

However, a remarkably large number of words are unique to Pashto.

Here is an exemplary list of Pure Pashto and borrowings:

Due to the incursion of Persian and Persianized-Arabic in modern speech, linguistic purism of Pashto is advocated to prevent its own vocabulary from dying out.

=== Classical vocabulary ===
There is a lot of old vocabulary that has been replaced by borrowings e.g. &#x27;throne&#x27; with , from Persian. Or the word meaning &#x27;uniqueness&#x27; used by Pir Roshan Bayazid. Such classical vocabulary is being reintroduced to modern Pashto. Some words also survive in dialects like &#x27;the bride-room&#x27;.

Example from Khayr al-Bayān:
: Transliteration: 
: Translation: &quot;... without singularity/uniqueness, without calmness and by bad-attitude are on sin .&quot;

==Writing system==

Pashto employs the Pashto alphabet, a modified form of the Perso-Arabic alphabet or Arabic script. In the 16th century, Bayazid Pir Roshan introduced 13 new letters to the Pashto alphabet. The alphabet was further modified over the years.

The Pashto alphabet consists of 45 to 46 letters and 4 diacritic marks. Latin Pashto is also used. In Latin transliteration, stress is represented by the following markers over vowels: ә́, á, ā́, ú, ó, í and é. The following table (read from left to right) gives the letters&#x27; isolated forms, along with possible Latin equivalents and typical IPA values:
==Dialects==

Pashto dialects are divided into two categories, the &quot;soft&quot; southern grouping of &quot;Paṣ̌tō&quot;, and the &quot;hard&quot; northern grouping of &quot;Pax̌tō&quot; (Pakhtu). Each group is further divided into a number of dialects. The Southern dialect of Tareeno is the most distinctive Pashto dialect.1. Southern variety
:*&quot;Abdaili&quot; or Kandahar dialect (or South Western dialect)
:*&quot;Kakar&quot; dialect (or South Eastern dialect)
:*&quot;Shirani&quot; dialect

3. Tareeno Dialect

== Literary Pashto ==
Literary Pashto is the artificial variety of Pashto that is used at times as literary register of Pashto. It is said to be based on the North Western dialect, spoken in the central Ghilji region. Literary Pashto&#x27;s vocabulary, also derives from other dialects.

=== Criticism ===
There is no actual Pashto that can be identified as &quot;Standard&quot; Pashto, as Colye remarks:

According to David MacKenzie, there is no real need to develop a &quot;Standard&quot; Pashto:
==Literature==
Pashto-speakers have long had a tradition of oral literature, including proverbs, stories, and poems. Written Pashto literature saw a rise in development in the 17th century mostly due to poets like Khushal Khan Khattak (1613–1689), who, along with Rahman Baba (1650–1715), is widely regarded as among the greatest Pashto poets. From the time of Ahmad Shah Durrani (1722–1772), Pashto has been the language of the court. The first Pashto teaching text was written during the period of Ahmad Shah Durrani by Pir Mohammad Kakar with the title of &quot;Maʿrifat al-Afghānī&quot; (&quot;The Knowledge of Afghani [Pashto]&quot;). After that, the first grammar book of Pashto verbs was written in 1805 under the title of &quot;Riyāż al-Maḥabbah&quot; (&quot;Training in Affection&quot;) through the patronage of Nawab Mahabat Khan, son of Hafiz Rahmat Khan, chief of the Barech. Nawabullah Yar Khan, another son of Hafiz Rahmat Khan, in 1808 wrote a book of Pashto words entitled &quot;ʿAjāyib al-Lughāt&quot; (&quot;Wonders of Languages&quot;).

===Poetry example===
An excerpt from the &quot;Kalām&quot; of Rahman Baba:

Pronunciation: 

Transliteration: 

Translation: &quot;I Rahman, myself am guilty that I am a lover,
On what does this other universe call me guilty.&quot;

===Proverbs===
Pashto also has a rich heritage of proverbs (Pashto &quot;matalúna&quot;, sg. &quot;matál&quot;). An example of a proverb:

Transliteration: O&quot;bә́ pə ḍāng nə beléẓ̌i&quot;

Translation: &quot;One cannot divide water by [hitting it with] a pole.&quot;

<text>The Pembrokeshire Coast Path (), often called the Pembrokeshire Coastal Path, is a designated National Trail in Pembrokeshire, southwest Wales. Established in 1970, it is a long-distance walking route, mostly at cliff-top level, with a total of of ascent and descent. At its highest point – Pen yr afr, on Cemaes Head – it reaches a height of , and at its lowest point – Sandy Haven crossing, near Milford Haven – it is just above low water. Whilst most of the coastline faces west, it offers – at varying points – coastal views in every direction of the compass.

The southern end of the path is at Amroth, Pembrokeshire. The northern end is often regarded as being at Poppit Sands, near St. Dogmaels, Pembrokeshire, where the official plaque was originally sited but the path now continues to St. Dogmaels, where a new marker was unveiled in July 2009. Here the path links with the Ceredigion Coast Path, which continues northwards.

The Pembrokeshire Coast Path forms part of the Wales Coast Path around the whole coast of Wales from Chepstow to Queensferry, which was officially opened in 2012.

==History of the path==
Following the establishment of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park in 1952, Welsh naturalist and author Ronald Lockley surveyed a route around the coast. Although there were villages and settlements on the coast, communication between these was largely by boats, and access in the region was generally poor. Lockley&#x27;s report for the Countryside Commission in 1953 was welcomed and broadly adopted. Some sections of the walk were existing rights-of-way, but the majority were in private hands, necessitating negotiation. Most landowners were in favour, and many benefitted from the erection of new fencing. Even today, however, the path in places detours from the obvious line where landowners were unwilling to accept a new right-of-way across their land.

Completion of the path took 17 years, and this work included the erection of more than 100 footbridges and 479 stiles, and the cutting of thousands of steps into steep or slippery sections. When opened by Wynford Vaughan-Thomas on 16 May 1970, the length of the path was given as , but over the years there have been a number of Footpath Diversion Orders which have extended it to its current length of .

Celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the path&#x27;s opening were due to be held in May 2020, but were postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, during which the public were asked not to use the path.

==Description==

The Pembrokeshire Coast Path lies almost entirely within the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park — Britain&#x27;s only coastal national park. Throughout its length, it covers a range of maritime landscapes, from rugged and steep limestone cliffs and volcanic headlands to sheltered red sandstone coves, flooded glacial valleys, winding estuaries, and wide-open beaches. The path passes 58 beaches and 14 harbours.

As far as possible the route runs close to the cliff edge and coast, but this is not possible at all times; on occasion the coast is barely visible where the path briefly detours round industrial or for miles around military areas such as Castlemartin Training Area. Since the construction of the Cleddau Bridge across Milford Haven Waterway it is possible to walk the whole route of the trail without a break. The path, however, is not continuous in that it is not designated through built-up areas in the southern section, such as Milford Haven, Pembroke Dock, Tenby and Saundersfoot. There is also an undesignated section between St Dogmaels and Cardigan at the northern end of the path where Cardigan Bridge over the River Teifi is the nearest point to the coast between the Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion Coast Paths.

The walking is not strenuous, but there are constant undulations and narrow sections, including many stiles. In its entirety the Coast Path represents a considerable physical challenge — its of ascent and descent is said to be equivalent to climbing Everest. There are two low-tide crossings, at Dale and Sandy Haven, which require lengthy detours if not timed suitably.

Along the path are seaside towns and coastal villages, such as Tenby, St Davids, Solva and Newport. For backpackers attempting longer parts of the trail there are shops and campsites along the way, but food and water may need to be carried on some sections. There are small hotels and guest houses en route, and cottages for hire, often built in traditional styles.

For the vast majority of walkers, the coastal path is walked in shorter sections, and the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park lists some 130 shorter circular walks on its website. Access to the coastal path (by bus or car) is possible in many locations. The whole coast is served by a number of dedicated walkers&#x27; bus services, which operate over the entire length of the path, including the Puffin Shuttle, the Coastal Cruiser, the Celtic Coaster, St David&#x27;s Peninsula Shuttle Service, the Strumble Shuttle, and the Poppit Rocket.

==Offshoot trails==
There are a number of smaller trails very near the Coast Path, which often take users inland on shorter routes; these include:
*Cardigan to Cilgerran Wildlife Trail. The trail runs from Station Road, Cardigan, through Teifi Marshes Nature Reserve, to Cilgerran, passing the Welsh Wildlife Centre and following the trackbed of the former Whitland and Cardigan Railway.
*Cilgerran Gorge Circular Walk. This is a medium-length walk of lasting around 3 hours. It starts at Dolbadau car park, Cilgerran and follows the woodland pathway to the Wildlife Centre and returning via undulating paths up and down the steep-sided Cilgerran Gorge. 
*Brunel Way Walk. This is a long walk of on well-surfaced tarmac pathways, lasting around 4 hours. It begins at Brunel Quay car park, Neyland and ends at County Hall, Haverfordwest. Along the way there are views of Milford Haven and of the quay.

==Geology==
All the rocks underlying the surface are more than 300 million years old, but the coastline as seen today has been much subjected to the effects of coastal and river action and, in places, to events which occurred during the Ice Age.

The oldest igneous and volcanic Precambrian granites outcrop on Ramsey and at the southern tip of the peninsula. Later Cambrian sedimentation produced sandstones, visible on the northern coast of St. Brides Bay (and which were used in the building St David&#x27;s Cathedral). Subsequent Ordovician fine muds dominate the northern Pembrokeshire coast, but volcanic activity has complicated the whole. The later Silurian Period saw the creation of limestone and shale, visible along the southern Marloes peninsula. The coast of St Brides Bay is backed by Coal Measures rocks dating from the late Carboniferous Period as is the coast between Tenby and Amroth and the upper reaches of the Cleddau. Much of the rest of Milford Haven is fronted by Old Red Sandstone from the preceding Devonian Period along with all of the Dale peninsula and Skokholm Island. Carboniferous Limestone dating from the early Carboniferous forms much of the southern coast traversed by the coast path notably between Freshwater West and Stackpole and between Lydstep and Tenby.

Subsequent earth movements, erosion by ice and water, and changes in sea level have further affected what we see today.

==Wildlife==
During the spring and early summer the path displays an array of wild coastal flowers, and there is a wealth of bird life. Colonies of seabirds nest along the cliffs, and a variety of European seabirds are supported by the uninhabited offshore islands that act as bird sanctuaries, such as Skomer, Skokholm and Ramsey Island. Seals, porpoises and dolphins can often be spotted swimming offshore.

==Human history and activity==
Remnants of Neolithic cromlechs and hut circles can be seen on the path, as can evidence of Bronze Age settlement, by which time the peninsula was being used as a connection to Ireland. Iron Age settlers, probably originating in France, are responsible for the number of coastal promontory fortifications visible today. The evidence of later human activity, such as Norman castles and settlements, and hermit churches, is also evident. Today almost all the surrounding land is farmed, and fishing still plays a role, albeit less prominent, in the coastal settlements.
==Award==
In 2011 &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine voted Pembrokeshire the second-best coastal destination in the world.

The Coastal Path passes all of Pembrokeshire&#x27;s award-winning beaches, Over the years these have been awarded 41 Blue Flag Awards (13 in 2011), 47 Green Coast Awards (15 in 2011) and 106 Seaside Awards (31 in 2011). In 2011 there were 39 beaches recommended by the Marine Conservation Society.

<text>Pembrokeshire ( ; ) is a county in the south-west of Wales. It is bordered by Carmarthenshire to the east, Ceredigion to the northeast, and otherwise by the sea. Haverfordwest is the largest town and administrative headquarters of Pembrokeshire County Council.

The county is generally sparsely populated and rural, with an area of and a population of 123,400. After Haverfordwest, the largest settlements are Milford Haven (13,907), Pembroke Dock (9,753), and Pembroke (7,552). St Davids (1,841) is a city, the smallest by population in the UK. Welsh is spoken by 17.2 percent of the population, and for historic reasons is more widely spoken in the north of the county than in the south.

Pembrokeshire&#x27;s coast is its most dramatic geographic feature, created by the complex geology of the area. It is a varied landscape which includes high sea cliffs, wide sandy beaches, the large natural harbour of Milford Haven, and several offshore islands which are home to seabird colonies. Most of it is protected by Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, and can be hiked on the Pembrokeshire Coast Path. The interior of Pembrokeshire is relatively flat and gently undulating, with the exception of the Preseli Mountains in the north.

There are many prehistoric sites in Pembrokeshire, particularly in the Preseli Mountains. During the Middle Ages several castles were built by the Normans, such as Pembroke and Cilgerran, and St David&#x27;s Cathedral became an important pilgrimage site. During the Industrial Revolution the county remained relatively rural, with the exception of Milford Haven, which was developed as a port and Royal Navy dockyard. It is now the UK&#x27;s third-largest port, primarily because of its two liquefied natural gas terminals. The economy of the county is now focused on agriculture, oil and gas, and tourism.

==Settlements==
:&quot;See List of places in Pembrokeshire for a comprehensive list of settlements in Pembrokeshire.&quot;

The county town is Haverfordwest. Other towns include Pembroke, Pembroke Dock, Milford Haven, Fishguard, Tenby, Narberth, Neyland and Newport. In the west of the county, St Davids is the United Kingdom&#x27;s smallest city in terms of both size and population (1,841 in 2011). Saundersfoot is the most populous village (more than 2,500 inhabitants) in Pembrokeshire. Less than 4 per cent of the county, according to CORINE, is built-on or green urban.

==Geography==

===Climate===
There are three weather stations in Pembrokeshire: at Tenby, Milford Haven and Penycwm, all on the coast. Milford Haven enjoys a mild climate and Tenby shows a similar range of temperatures throughout the year, while at Penycwm, on the west coast and 100m above sea level, temperatures are slightly lower.

The county has on average the highest coastal winter temperatures in Wales due to its proximity to the relatively warm Atlantic Ocean. Inland, average temperatures tend to fall 0.5 °C for each 100 metres increase in height.

The air pollution rating of Pembrokeshire is &quot;Good&quot;, the lowest rating.

===Geology===
The rocks in the county were formed between 600 and 290 million years ago. More recent rock formations were eroded when sea levels rose 80 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous Period. Around 60 million years ago, the Pembrokeshire landmass emerged through a combination of uplift and falling sea levels; the youngest rocks, from the Carboniferous Period, contain the Pembrokeshire Coalfield. The landscape was subject to considerable change as a result of ice ages; about 20,000 years ago the area was scraped clean of soil and vegetation by the ice sheet; subsequently, meltwater deepened the existing river valleys. While Pembrokeshire is not usually a seismically active area, in August 1892 there was a series of pronounced activities (maximum intensity: 7) over a six-day period.

===Coastline and landscape===

The Pembrokeshire coastline includes numerous bays and sandy beaches. The Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, the only park in the UK established primarily because of its coastline, occupies more than a third of the county. The park contains the Pembrokeshire Coast Path, a near-continuous long-distance trail from Amroth, by the Carmarthenshire border in the southeast, to St Dogmaels just down the River Teifi estuary from Cardigan, Ceredigion, in the north. The National Trust owns of Pembrokeshire&#x27;s coast. Nowhere in the county is more than from tidal water. The large estuary and natural harbour of Milford Haven cuts deep into the coast; this inlet is formed by the confluence of the Western Cleddau (which flows through Haverfordwest), the Eastern Cleddau, and rivers Cresswell and Carew. Since 1975, the estuary has been bridged by the Cleddau Bridge, a toll bridge carrying the A477 between Neyland and Pembroke Dock. Large bays are Newport Bay, Fishguard Bay, St Bride&#x27;s Bay and western Carmarthen Bay. There are several small islands off the Pembrokeshire coast, the largest of which are Ramsey, Grassholm, Skokholm, Skomer and Caldey. The seas around Skomer and Skokholm, and some other areas off the Pembrokeshire coast are Marine protected areas.

There are many known shipwrecks off the Pembrokeshire coast with many more undiscovered. A Viking wreck off The Smalls has protected status. The county has six lifeboat stations, the earliest of which was established in 1822; in 2015 a quarter of all Royal National Lifeboat Institution Welsh rescues took place off the Pembrokeshire coast.
Pembrokeshire&#x27;s diverse range of geological features was a key factor in the establishment of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park and a number of sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs). In the north of the county are the Preseli Mountains, a wide stretch of high moorland supporting sheep farming and some forestry, with many prehistoric sites and the probable source of the bluestones used in the construction of the inner circle of Stonehenge in England. The highest point is Foel Cwmcerwyn at , which is also the highest point in Pembrokeshire. Elsewhere in the county most of the land (86 per cent according to CORINE) is used for farming, compared with 60 per cent for Wales as a whole.

===Biodiversity===
Pembrokeshire&#x27;s wildlife is diverse, with marine, estuary, woodland, moorland and farmland habitats. The county has a number of seasonal seabird breeding sites, including for razorbill, guillemot, puffin and Manx shearwater, and rare endemic species such as the red-billed chough; Grassholm has a large gannet colony. Seals, several species of whales (including rare humpback whale sightings), dolphins and porpoises can be seen off the Pembrokeshire coast; whale-watching boat trips are frequent, particularly during the summer months. An appeal for otter sightings in 2014 yielded more than 100 responses, and a rare visit by a walrus occurred in the spring of 2021.

Pembrokeshire is one of the few places in the UK that is home to the rare Southern damselfly, &quot;Coenagrion mercuriale&quot;, which is found at several locations in the county, and whose numbers have been boosted by conservation work over a number of years.

Ancient woodland still exists, such as Tŷ Canol Wood, where biofluorescence, seen under ultraviolet light under the dark sky, is a feature that has led to the wood being described as &quot;...one of the most magical and special woodlands in the UK.&quot;

The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales is in the process of restoring a lost temperate rainforest, also known as a Celtic forest, in Trellwyn Fach, near the town of Fishguard. Although temperate rainforests once covered much of western Britain&#x27;s coasts, they were destroyed over centuries and only remain in fragments. The site will connect with remnants of the remaining rainforest in the Gwaun valley. The project is part of a larger, 100-year Atlantic rainforest recovery programme.

==History==

Human habitation of the region that is now Pembrokeshire extends back to between 125,000 and 70,000 years and there are numerous prehistoric sites such as Pentre Ifan, and neolithic remains (12,000 to 6,500 years ago), more of which were revealed in an aerial survey during the 2018 heatwave; in the same year, a 1st-century Celtic chariot burial was discovered in Llanstadwell, the first such find in Wales. There may have been dairy farming in Neolithic times.

===Roman period===

There is little evidence of Roman occupation in what is now Pembrokeshire. Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;, written , mentioned some coastal places, two of which have been identified as the River Teifi and what is now St Davids Head, but most Roman writers did not mention the area; there may have been a Roman settlement near St Davids and a road from Bath, but this comes from a 14th-century writer. Any evidence for villas or Roman building materials reported by mediaeval or later writers has not been verified, though some remains near Dale were tentatively identified as Roman in character by topographer Richard Fenton in his &quot;Historical Tour&quot; of 1810. Fenton stated that he had &quot;...reason to be of opinion that they had not colonized Pembrokeshire till near the decline of their empire in Britain&quot;.

Part of a possible Roman road is noted by CADW near Llanddewi Velfrey, and another near Wiston. Wiston is also the location of the first Roman fort discovered in Pembrokeshire, investigated in 2013. A find in north Pembrokeshire in 2024 of the likely remains of a Roman fort adds to the extent of Roman military presence in the area. 

Some artefacts, including coins and weapons, have been found, but it is not clear whether these belonged to Romans or to a Romanised population. Welsh tradition has it that Magnus Maximus founded Haverfordwest, and took a large force of local men on campaign in Gaul in 383 which, together with the reduction of Roman forces in south Wales, left a defensive vacuum which was filled by incomers from Ireland.

===Sub-Roman period===

Between 350 and 400, an Irish tribe known as the Déisi settled in the region known to the Romans as &quot;Demetae&quot;. The Déisi merged with the local Welsh, with the regional name underlying &quot;Demetae&quot; evolving into Dyfed, which existed as an independent petty kingdom from the 5th century. In 904, Hywel Dda married Elen (died 943), daughter of the king of Dyfed Llywarch ap Hyfaidd, and merged Dyfed with his own maternal inheritance of Seisyllwg, forming the new realm of Deheubarth (&quot;southern district&quot;). Between the Roman and Norman periods, the region was subjected to raids from Vikings, who established settlements and trading posts at Haverfordwest, Fishguard, Caldey Island and elsewhere.

===Norman period and Middle Ages===

Dyfed remained an integral province of Deheubarth, but this was contested by invading Normans and Flemings who arrived between 1067 and 1111. The region became known as Pembroke (sometimes archaic &quot;Penbroke&quot;), after the Norman castle built in the cantref of Penfro. In 1136, Prince Owain Gwynedd at Crug Mawr near Cardigan met and destroyed a 3,000-strong Norman/Flemish army and incorporated Deheubarth into Gwynedd. 
Norman/Flemish influence never fully recovered in West Wales. In 1138, the county of Pembrokeshire was named as a county palatine. Rhys ap Gruffydd, the son of Owain Gwynedd&#x27;s daughter Gwenllian, re-established Welsh control over much of the region and threatened to retake all of Pembrokeshire, but died in 1197. After Deheubarth was split by a dynastic feud, Llywelyn the Great almost succeeded in retaking the region of Pembroke between 1216 and his death in 1240. In 1284 the Statute of Rhuddlan was enacted to introduce the English common law system to Wales, heralding 100 years of peace, but had little effect on those areas already established under the Marcher Lords, such as Cemais in the north of the county.
Henry Tudor, born at Pembroke Castle in 1457, landed an army in Pembrokeshire in 1485 and marched to Cardigan via Haverforwest. Rallying support, he continued to Leicestershire and defeated the larger army of Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field. As Henry VII, he became the first monarch of the House of Tudor, which ruled England until 1603.
===Tudor and Stuart periods===
The Laws in Wales Act 1535 effectively abolished the powers of the Marcher Lords and divided the county into seven hundreds, roughly corresponding to the seven pre-Norman cantrefi of Dyfed. The hundreds were (clockwise from the northeast): Cilgerran, Cemais, Dewisland, Roose, Castlemartin, Narberth and Dungleddy and each was divided into civil parishes; a 1578 map by Christopher Saxton is the earliest known to show parishes and chapelries in Pembrokeshire; (see list of hundreds and parishes). The Elizabethan era brought renewed prosperity to the county through an opening up of rural industries, including agriculture, mining and fishing, with exports to England and Ireland, though the formerly staple woollen industry had all but disappeared.

During the First English Civil War (1642–1646) the county gave strong support to the Roundheads (Parliamentarians), in contrast to the rest of Wales, which was staunchly Royalist. In spite of this, an incident in Pembrokeshire triggered the opening shots of the Second English Civil War when local units of the New Model Army mutinied. Oliver Cromwell defeated the uprising at the Siege of Pembroke in July 1648. On 13 August 1649, the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland began when New Model Army forces sailed from Milford Haven.

===18th and 19th centuries===

In 1720, Emmanuel Bowen described Pembrokeshire as having five market towns, 45 parishes, and about 4,329 houses, with an area of . In 1791 a petition was presented to the House of Commons concerning the poor state of many of the county&#x27;s roads, pointing out that repairs could not be made compulsory by the law as it stood. The petition was referred to committee. People applying for poor relief were often put to work mending roads. Workhouses were poorly documented. Under the Poor Laws, costs and provisions were kept to a minimum, but the emphasis was often on helping people to be self-employed. While the Poor Laws provided a significant means of support, there were many charitable and benefit societies. After the Battle of Fishguard, the failed French invasion of 1797, 500 French prisoners were held at Golden Hill Farm, Pembroke. From 1820 to 1878 one of the county&#x27;s prisons, with a capacity of 86, was in the grounds of Haverfordwest Castle. In 1831, the area of the county was calculated to be with a population of 81,424.

It was not until nearly the end of the 19th century that mains water was provided to rural south Pembrokeshire by means of a reservoir at Rosebush and cast iron water pipes throughout the district.

===20th century===

Throughout much of the 20th century (1911 to 1961) the population density in the county remained stable while it rose in England and Wales as a whole. There was considerable military activity in Pembrokeshire and offshore in the 20th century: a naval base at Milford Haven because German U-boats were active off the coast in World War I The County of Pembroke War Memorial in Haverfordwest carries the names of 1,200 of those that perished in World War I. 

The Pembrokeshire War Savings Movement was a local initiative during World War I to encourage county residents to invest in the war effort through the purchase of war bonds and savings certificates. Linking savings with schools was key; schools were the backbone of the 138 war savings associations which were operational in Pembrokeshire in the summer of 1918. The movement continued beyond the end of the war; for the week ending 1 February 1919, some 2,308,810 certificates were sold.

In World War II, military exercises in the Preseli Mountains and a number of military airfields. The wartime increase in air activity saw a number of aircraft accidents and fatalities, often due to unfamiliarity with the terrain. From 1943 to 1944, 5,000 soldiers from the United States Army&#x27;s 110th Infantry Regiment were based in the county, preparing for D-Day. Military and industrial targets in the county were subjected to bombing during World War II. After the end of the war, German prisoners of war were accommodated in Pembrokeshire, the largest prison being at Haverfordwest, housing 600.

In 1972, a second reservoir for south Pembrokeshire, at Llys y Fran, was completed.

==Demography==
===Population===
Pembrokeshire&#x27;s population was 122,439 at the 2011 census, increasing marginally to 123,400 at the 2021 census. 66.4 per cent of residents were born in Wales, while 27.5 per cent were born in England.

===Language===
The 2021 census recorded that Welsh is spoken by 17.2 per cent of the population, a fall from 19.2 per cent in 2011. As a result of differential immigration over hundreds of years, such as the influx of Flemish people, the south of the county has fewer Welsh-speaking inhabitants (about 15 per cent) than the north (about 50 per cent). The rough line that can be drawn between the two regions, illustrated by the map, is known as the Landsker Line, and the area south of the line has been termed &quot;Little England Beyond Wales&quot;. The first objective, statistically based description of this demarcation was made in the 1960s, but the distinction was remarked upon as early as 1603 by George Owen of Henllys. A 21st century introduction of Welsh place names for villages which had previously been known locally only by their English names has caused some controversy.

===Religion===
In 1851, a religious census of Pembrokeshire showed that of 70 per cent of the population, 53 per cent were nonconformists and 17 per cent Church of England (now Church in Wales, in the Diocese of St Davids). The 2001 census for Preseli Pembrokeshire constituency showed that 74 per cent were Christian and 25 per cent of no religion (or not stated), with other religions totalling less than 1 per cent. This approximated to the figures for the whole of Wales. By 2021, 43 per cent reported &quot;no religion&quot;, while 48.8 per cent described themselves as Christian. 6.6 per cent did not state their religion, and the remainder represented a number of other religions combined.

===Ethnicity===
In 2001, Preseli Pembrokeshire constituency was 99 per cent white European, marginally lower than in 1991, compared with 98 per cent for the whole of Wales. 71 per cent identified their place of birth as Wales and 26 per cent as from elsewhere in the UK. In 2021, 52.7 per cent of residents identified as &quot;Welsh only&quot;, a slight decrease since 2011.

==Governance, politics and public services==

Under the Local Government Act 1888, an elected county council was set up to take over the functions of the Pembrokeshire Quarter Sessions. It was based at the Shire Hall, Haverfordwest. This and the administrative county of Pembrokeshire were abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, with Pembrokeshire forming two districts of the new county of Dyfed: South Pembrokeshire and Preseli – the split being made at the request of local authorities in the area. Under the same Act, civil parishes were replaced by communities across the whole of Wales. In 1996, under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, the county of Dyfed was broken up into its constituent parts, and Pembrokeshire has been a unitary authority since then. A new County Hall was built in 1999 in Haverfordwest and serves as the county council&#x27;s headquarters. In 2017 Pembrokeshire County Council had 60 members and no political party in overall control; there were 34 independent councillors.

In 2009, the question of county names and Royal Mail postal addresses was raised in the Westminster parliament; it was argued that Royal Mail&#x27;s continued use of the county address Dyfed was causing concern and confusion in the Pembrokeshire business community. The Royal Mail subsequently ceased requiring county names to be used in postal addresses.

In 2018, Pembrokeshire County Council increased council tax by 12.5 per cent, the largest increase since 2004, but the county&#x27;s council tax remains the lowest in Wales. In 2023 the council published its corporate strategy document for 2023-28.

The Pembrokeshire (Communities) Order 2011 established the most recent arrangement of communities (the successors to civil parishes) in the county which have their own councils; see the foot of this page for a list of communities.

From 2010 to 2024, Pembrokeshire returned two Conservative MPs to the Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster: Stephen Crabb for Preseli Pembrokeshire and Simon Hart for South Pembrokeshire which is represented jointly with West Carmarthenshire. The corresponding Members of the Senedd (MSs) returned to the Senedd (Welsh Parliament) in Cardiff are Paul Davies and Samuel Kurtz respectively, both Conservatives.

From 2024, Pembrokeshire was represented by the new UK Parliament constituencies Ceredigion Preseli and Mid and South Pembrokeshire which, in the 2024 General Election, returned Ben Lake (Plaid Cymru) and Henry Tufnell (Labour) respectively.

Pembrokeshire is served by the Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service and Dyfed-Powys Police.

==Transport==

There are no motorways in Pembrokeshire; the nearest is the M4 motorway from London which terminates at the Pont Abraham services in Carmarthenshire some from Haverfordwest. The A40 crosses Pembrokeshire from the border with Carmarthenshire westwards to Haverfordwest, then northwards to Fishguard. The A477 from St. Clears to Pembroke Dock is long, of which only are dual carriageway. The Cleddau Bridge, toll-free from 28 March 2019, carries the A477 across the Cleddau Estuary. The A478 traverses eastern Pembrokeshire from Tenby in the south to Cardigan, Ceredigion in the north, a distance of . The A487 is the other major route, running northwest from Haverfordwest to St Davids, then northeast following the coast, through Fishguard and Newport, to the boundary with Ceredigion at Cardigan. Owing to length restrictions in Fishguard, some freight vehicles are not permitted to travel northeast from Fishguard but must take a longer route via Haverfordwest and Narberth. The B4329 former turnpike runs from Eglwyswrw in the north to Haverfordwest across the Preselis.

The main towns in the county are covered by regular bus and train services operated by First Cymru (under their &quot;Western Welsh&quot; livery), Transport for Wales Rail and sometimes Great Western Railway respectively, and many villages by local bus services, or community or education transport.

Pembrokeshire is served by rail via the West Wales Lines from Swansea. Direct trains from Milford Haven run to Manchester Piccadilly. Branch lines terminate at Pembroke Dock, Milford Haven and Fishguard, linking with ferries to Ireland from Pembroke Dock and Fishguard. Seasonal ferry services operate from Tenby to Caldey Island, from St Justinians (St Davids) to Ramsey Island and Grassholm Island, and from Martin&#x27;s Haven to Skomer Island. Haverfordwest (Withybush) Airport provides general aviation services.

==Economy==
Pembrokeshire&#x27;s economy now relies heavily on tourism; agriculture, once its most important industry with associated activities such as milling, is still significant. Mining of slate and coal had largely ceased by the 20th century. Since the 1950s, petrochemical and liquid natural gas industries have developed along the Milford Haven Waterway and the county has attracted other major ventures. In 2016, Stephen Crabb, then Welsh Secretary, commented in a government press release: &quot;...with a buoyant local economy, Pembrokeshire is punching above its weight across the UK.&quot;

In August 2019, the Pembrokeshire County Show celebrated 60 years at Haverfordwest Showground. The organisers anticipated 100,000 visitors, the largest three-day such event in Wales at the time. It showcased agriculture, food and drink, a rugby club, entertainment, with the star attraction a motorcycle display team.

===Agriculture===
Until the 12th century, a great extent of Pembrokeshire was virgin woodland. Clearance in the lowland south began under Anglo-Flemish colonisation and under mediaeval tenancies in other areas. Such was the extent of development that by the 16th century there was a shortage of timber in the county. Little is known about mediaeval farming methods, but much arable land was continuously cropped and only occasionally ploughed. By the 18th century, many of the centuries-old open field systems had been enclosed, and much of the land was arable or rough pasture in a ratio of about 1:3.
Kelly&#x27;s Directory of 1910 gave a snapshot of the agriculture of Pembrokeshire: were cropped (almost half under oats and a quarter barley), there were of grass and clover and of permanent pasture (of which a third was for hay). There were of mountain or heathland used for grazing, with of managed or unmanaged woodland. Estimates of livestock included 17,810 horses, 92,386 cattle, 157,973 sheep and 31,673 pigs. Of 5,981 agricultural holdings, more than half were between 5 and 50 acres.

Pembrokeshire had a flourishing wool industry. There are still working woollen mills at Solva and Tregwynt. One of the last few watermills in Wales producing flour is in St Dogmaels.

Pembrokeshire has good soil and benefits from the Gulf Stream, which provides a mild climate and a longer growing season than other parts of Wales. Pembrokeshire&#x27;s mild climate means that crops such as its new potatoes (which have protected geographical status under European law) often arrive in British shops earlier in the year than produce from other parts of the UK. Other principal arable crops are oilseed rape, wheat and barley, while the main non-arable activities are dairy farming for milk and cheese, beef production and sheep farming.

The county lends its name to the Pembroke Welsh Corgi, a herding dog whose lineage can be traced back to the 12th century, but which in 2015 was designated as a &quot;vulnerable&quot; breed.

Since 2006, Pembrokeshire Local Action Network for Enterprise and Development (PLANED) has provided a forum to promote an integrated approach to rural development, in which communities, public sector and voluntary partners and specialist interest groups come together to influence policy and promote projects aimed at sustainable agriculture. Sub-groups include promoting food and farming in schools and shortening supply chains.

===Fishing===

With Pembrokeshire&#x27;s extensive coastal areas and tidal river estuaries, fishing was an important industry at least from the 16th century. Many ports and villages were dependent on the fishing. The former large sea fishing industry around Milford Haven is now greatly reduced, although limited commercial fishing still takes place. At its peak, Milford was landing over 40,000 tons of fish a year. Pembrokeshire Fish Week is a biennial event which in 2014 attracted 31,000 visitors and generated £3 million for the local economy.

===Mining===
Slate quarrying was a significant industry in the 19th and early 20th centuries with quarrying taking place at about 100 locations throughout the county. Over 50 coal workings in the Pembrokeshire Coalfield were in existence between the 14th and 20th centuries, with the last coal mine, at Kilgetty, closing in 1950. Pembrokeshire has 61 disused coal tips; only one of these is in Category C (carrying a potential safety risk), but its location has not been disclosed.

===Oil, gas and renewable energy===
There are two oil refineries, two liquified natural gas (LNG) terminals and the 2,000 MW gas-fired Pembroke Power Station (opened in 2012) at Milford Haven. The LNG terminals on the north side of the river, just outside Milford Haven were opened in 2008; a pipeline connecting Milford Haven to Tirley in Gloucestershire was completed in 2007. The two oil refineries are operated by Chevron (formerly Texaco) producing and Murco (formerly Amoco/Elf) producing ; the latter was sold to Puma Energy in 2015 with the intention of converting it to a storage facility. At the peak, there were a total of five refineries served from around the Haven: the Esso refinery operated from 1960 to 1983, was demolished in the late 1980s and the site converted into the South Hook LNG terminal; the Gulf Refinery operated from 1968 to 1997 and the site now incorporates the Dragon LNG terminal; BP had an oil terminal at Angle Bay which served its refinery at Llandarcy and operated between 1961 and 1985.

The Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority has identified a number of areas in which renewable energy can be, and has been, generated in the county. Following several years of planning after the initial impact studies begun in 2011, the first submarine turbine of three was installed in Ramsey Sound in December 2015. The cumulative impact of single and multiple wind turbines is not without controversy and was the subject of a comprehensive assessment in 2013. In 2011 the first solar energy farm in Wales was installed at Rhosygilwen, Rhoshill with 10,000 panels in a field of , generating 1 MW.

===Tourism===

Pembrokeshire&#x27;s tourism portal is &quot;Visit Pembrokeshire&quot;, run by Pembrokeshire County Council. In 2015 4.3 million tourists visited the county, staying for an average of 5.24 days, spending £585 million; the tourism industry supported 11,834 jobs. Many of Pembrokeshire&#x27;s beaches have won awards, including Poppit Sands and Newport Sands. In 2018, Pembrokeshire received the most coast awards in Wales, with 56 Blue Flag, Green Coast or Seaside Awards. In the 2019 Wales Coast Awards, 39 Pembrokeshire beaches were recognised, including 11 awarded Blue Flag status.

The Pembrokeshire coastline is a major draw to tourists; in 2011 National Geographic Traveller magazine voted the Pembrokeshire Coast the second best in the world and in 2015 the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park was listed among the top five parks in the world by a travel writer for the Huffington Post. Countryfile Magazine readers voted the Pembrokeshire Coast the top UK holiday destination in 2018, and in 2019 Consumers&#x27; Association members placed Tenby and St Davids in the top three best value beach destinations in Britain. With few large urban areas, Pembrokeshire is a &quot;dark sky&quot; destination. The many wrecks off the Pembrokeshire coast attract divers. The decade from 2012 saw significant, increasing numbers of Atlantic bluefin tuna, not seen since the 1960s, and now seen by some as an opportunity to encourage tourist sport fishing.
The county has a number of theme and animal parks (examples are Folly Farm Adventure Park and Zoo, Manor House Wildlife Park, Blue Lagoon Water Park and Oakwood Theme Park), museums and other visitor attractions including Castell Henllys reconstructed Iron Age fort, Tenby Lifeboat Station and Milford Haven&#x27;s Torch Theatre. There are 21 marked cycle trails around the county.

Pembrokeshire Destination Management Plan for 2020 to 2025 sets out the scope and priorities to grow tourism in Pembrokeshire by increasing its value by 10 per cent in the five years, and to make Pembrokeshire a top five UK destination.

==Education and health==
A comprehensive review of education in Pembrokeshire was carried out in 2014 with a number of options for discussion in 2015. In 2018 there were 58 primary schools, eight secondary schools (two for ages 3 to 16) and one special school, in all providing education for more than 18,300 pupils. These include 15 Welsh medium primary schools in the county, three dual stream schools and two transition schools; four primary schools are classified as English Welsh schools (English medium schools with significant use of Welsh). In 2017/18, 22 per cent of seven-year-old pupils were educated through the medium of Welsh. This figure was expected to rise to 25 per cent by 2019/20. In 2019, there were two fewer primary schools. The local authority&#x27;s education budget for 2019/2020 was £88 million, equating to £4,856 per pupil. A February 2020 report by schools&#x27; inspection body Estyn, however, considered the local authority&#x27;s performance in education provision &quot;a significant concern&quot;.

<text>Janet Beth Evans (born August 28, 1971) is an American former competition swimmer who swam from 1989 to 1992 for Stanford University and specialized in distance freestyle events. Evans was a world champion and world record-holder, and won a total of four gold medals in the 400 and 800-meter freestyle events at the 1988 and the 1992 Olympics. In the late 1980s Evans was the first woman to hold three world records simultaneously in the 400, 800, and 1500-meter freestyle and was the first American woman to win four individual Olympic gold medals in swimming.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
Born in Fullerton, California, Evans grew up in neighboring Placentia, where she started swimming competitively by the age of 5. By the age of 11, she was setting national age group records in distance events. She swam as a teenager for Fullerton Aquatics Sports Team (FAST Swimming) where her most influential coach in the mid-1980&#x27;s was Bud McAllister.

In 1987, at age 15, Evans broke the world records in the 400-meter, 800-meter, and 1,500-meter freestyle distances.

=== High school ===
She graduated from El Dorado High School, and when not competing or representing FAST, she swam meets and trained with El Dorado High, where she was coached by Tom Milich, a 1987 California Swimming Coach of the Year, and an American Swimming Coaches Association (ASCA) Distinguished Coach of the Year.

=== College ===
==== Stanford University ====
Evans attended Stanford University, where she swam for the Stanford Cardinal swimming and diving team from 1989 to 1991 under Stanford&#x27;s Hall of Fame Women&#x27;s Head Coach Richard Quick. At Stanford, she received the Honda Sports Award for Swimming and Diving, recognizing her as the outstanding college female swimmer of the year in 1988–89. At Stanford, Evans was an All-American eight times, dominating distance events. She captured all the 500 free and 1650 free events in both 1990 and 1991, and in 1990 also captured a 400 IM title. She also took two national titles in the 800 free relay during those seasons.

==== University of Southern California ====
When the NCAA placed weekly hours limits on athletic training time, she quit the Stanford swim team to focus full time on training. She began training at the University of Texas at Austin the Texas Aquatic Club around 1992 under Coach Mark Schubert who helped prepare her for 1992 Olympic competition. Schubert served as Head women&#x27;s coach in the 1992 Olympics, where Evans excelled. After enrolling for the Spring semester in 1993, Evans graduated from the University of Southern California with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in communications in 1994, where Mark Schubert had moved and continued his coaching career. At USC, Evans trained under Schubert, worked out with the USC team and the Trojan Swim Club, and served as a student Assistant Coach for two seasons for the USC Women&#x27;s swim team. She could not compete for USC, however, because she had accepted commercial endorsements in Spring, 1991 after her Sophomore season at Stanford.

==Olympics==

===1988 Olympics===
At the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, she won three individual gold medals in the 400 and 800-meter freestyle and the 400-meter Individual Medley. At the games, she earned the nickname &quot;Miss Perpetual Motion&quot; due to her unique swimming style. In these Olympics, Evans set a new world record in the 400-meter freestyle event. This record stood for 18 years until France&#x27;s Laure Manaudou broke it in May 2006.

Evans held the 1,500-meter freestyle record, set in March 1988, through June 2007, when it was broken by American Kate Ziegler with her time of 15:42.54.

Evans held the world record in the 800-meter freestyle, 8:16:22, that she set in August 1989, until it was broken by Rebecca Adlington of Britain in August 2008. Adlington set the new record with her time of 8:14.10 in winning the race at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Evans&#x27;s 800-meter record was one of the longest-standing ones ever in swimming, and it went unbroken through four Olympic Games (1992–2004). Only the 100-meter freestyle swimming record set by the Dutch swimmer Willy den Ouden stood longer—from 1936 through 1956, during a period when international competition was interrupted by world war.

Following her 1988 Olympics performance, Evans continued to dominate the world&#x27;s long-distance swimming competitions, remaining undefeated in all of the 400-, 800-, and 1500-meter freestyle events for over five years.

===1992 Olympics===
Evans became the first woman to capture back-to-back Olympic and world championship titles in any one swimming event by winning the 1988 and 1992 Olympic gold medals and the 1991 and 1994 world championships in the 800-meter freestyle race. At the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, she won a silver in the 400-meter freestyle with a time of 4:07.37, taking second, and finished about .2 seconds behind German swimmer Dagmar Hase, whom she led for almost the entire competition but was narrowly caught at the end. Evans had held the record in the 400 since the 1988 Olympics, but her times in the event had been continually slowing. At the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, she also won a gold in the 800-meter freestyle in 8:25.52, another signature distance event, finishing nearly 5 seconds ahead of Australia&#x27;s Haley Lewis.

Evans won the 400-meter and 800-meter freestyle events at the U.S. National Championships 12 times each, the largest number of national titles in one event by an American swimmer in the 100-year history of the competition.

===1996 Olympics===
Evans ended her swimming career, for all practical purposes, at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. She did not win any medals, but she did add one more highlight to her life. She was given the honour of carrying the Olympic torch in the opening ceremony, handing it to the American boxing legend Muhammad Ali who lit the Olympic cauldron.

On July 27, 1996, she was in a building being interviewed by a German newsman when a bomb exploded nearby. The explosion very lightly shook the building and startled Evans. The incident traumatized her so much that she had a panic attack the next day while waiting for a train in an Atlanta subway station.

In 1996 Olympic heats, Evans finished ninth in the preliminaries of the 400-meter freestyle. She did not qualify for the finals, as only the top eight finishers advance to the next level. In the final swim of her career, Evans finished in sixth place in the 800-meter freestyle.

At the 1996 Atlanta Games, American swimming officials criticized Ireland&#x27;s Michelle Smith about her unexpected gold medals, suggesting that she might have been using performance-enhancing drugs. When asked about the accusations, Evans said that when anyone like Smith showed such a significant improvement, &quot;there&#x27;s always that question.&quot; American sportswriters sympathetic to Smith took this comment to mean that Evans was accusing Smith of steroid use as well, and they attacked Evans as being a sore loser. Evans later insisted that she meant no such accusation and that her remarks were taken out of context. In 1998, Smith received a four-year suspension for tampering with a urine sample.

===2012 Olympic trials===
In June 2011, it was reported that Evans was in the process of a comeback and had been training for six months with the goal of competing at the 2012 U.S. Olympic Trials. At the 2012 Olympic Trials, at the age of 40, she finished 80th out of 113 swimmers in the 400-meter freestyle and 53rd out of 65 swimmers in the 800-meter freestyle.

At the end of Evans&#x27;s swimming career, she held seven world records, five Olympic medals (including four gold medals), and 45 American national titles – third only to Tracy Caulkins and Michael Phelps. She was the first American woman to win four individual Olympic gold medals in swimming.

== Other activities ==
In 2010, Evans returned to competitive swimming as a United States Masters swimmer.

On November 3, 2016, Evans was chosen to serve as co-Grand Marshal of the 2017 Rose Parade.

Evans served as Vice Chair and Athletes director for the Los Angeles 2024 Olympic bid committee and traveled with the team to promote Los Angeles as a candidate city. Los Angeles was ultimately awarded the 2028 Summer Olympics at the 131st IOC Session in Lima, Peru, on September 13, 2017. As of 2020, Evans works with the organizing committee for the 2028 Summer Olympics in the executive leadership role of chief athlete officer.

As of August 2019, Evans works as chief athlete officer for the 2028 Summer Olympics organizing committee.

==Swim style and technique==
Evans was known for her unorthodox &quot;windmill&quot; stroke and her cardio-respiratory reserves. She had a higher stroke count than many distance swimmers, taking 55 strokes per 50 meters, when other distance swimmers took closer to 40. Her endurance was at least partly a product of her training. In July 1986, at the height of her training, she was reputed to have often completed as much as 13,000 meters in a day of workouts, the equivalent of 8 miles. Slight of build and short of stature, she more than once found herself competing and winning against bigger and stronger athletes, some of whom were subsequently found to have been using performance-enhancing drugs.

==Honors==
Janet Evans was the 1989 recipient of the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States. She was named the Female World Swimmer of the Year by &quot;Swimming World Magazine&quot; in 1987, 1989, and 1990. In 1988, as a junior in high school, she was recognized as a &quot;Rising Star&quot; by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. Evans was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame as an &quot;Honor Swimmer&quot; in 2001. In 1995, Evans was inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Evans married Bill Willson in Long Beach in 2004, with whom she has two children.

<text>The Bibbulmun Track is a long-distance walk trail in Western Australia. It runs from Kalamunda in the east of Perth to Albany, and is long.

It is managed by government agencies, and has a foundation.

It traverses the Darling Range and has inspired reflections about the state of the Western Australian environment by William J. Lines in his book &quot;A long walk in the Australian bush&quot;.

The name comes from the Bibbulmun, or Noongar people, Indigenous Australians from the Perth area.

==History==
 The route has been changed twice, partly due to it passing through a significant section of forest that was at risk to change from either forestry, bauxite mining or dieback.

The track was suggested in 1972. The groups that had suggested and also who were involved in planning with the then Forests Department of Western Australia were:
* Perth Bushwalkers
* Western Walking Club
* Youth Hostels Association
* Scout Association of Australia (W.A. Division)
* The Speleological Research Group of W.A.

The track was first opened in 1979 but the third and final alignment and extension through to Albany was opened in 1998 and retains less than 10% of earlier alignments.

The Bibbulmun Track is a walker-only trail. No wheeled vehicles of any kind are permitted. It has a parallel long-distance cycling trail – known as the Munda Biddi Trail – that opened all the way to Albany in April 2013. This trail is generally situated to the west of the Bibbulmun Track.

==Track sections==

The track consists of 58 sections and is marked at regular intervals with triangular signs, most of which have a symbol of the Wagyl. The Wagyl, or Rainbow Serpent, is a snakelike Dreamtime creature that is a common deity in Noongar culture. Each section is approximately one day&#x27;s walk, except for the northernmost or so, where the sections consist of half-day walks. At the end of each section is either a town or a purpose-built campsite. Each campsite consists of a three-sided shelter with wooden sleeping platforms, a water tank, a pit toilet, picnic tables and cleared tent sites. In the northern half, most campsites also have a barbecue pit and plate (open fires are banned in the southern section).

The Bibbulmun Track is almost all through state forest, national parks and other reserves, with only a few small sections of farmland. The first half of the track is through the jarrah forests of the Darling Range. It then moves through flatter tall karri forests until reaching the coastline near the town of Walpole. The remainder of the track is through coastal forest and scrub along the south coast, in some sections routed along sandy beaches.

The towns the track passes through are Dwellingup, Collie, Balingup, Pemberton, Northcliffe, Walpole and Denmark.
Highlights of the track include:
* Mundaring Weir
* Monadnocks area and Mount Cooke
* Murray River Valley
* Karri forests between Donnelly River and Denmark
* Tingle forest near Walpole
* Coastal scenery along the south coast
* Wildflower displays, birdlife and other Southwest Australian &quot;flora&quot; and &quot;fauna&quot;.
* Marine mammals along the south coast such as seals, dolphins and whales

The Bibbulmun Track is managed by the Western Australian Parks and Wildlife Service at the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions and The Bibbulmun Track Foundation – an incorporated not-for-profit community-based organisation established to provide support for the department in the management, maintenance and marketing of the track to ensure that it remains a &quot;long-distance walk trail of international significance and quality&quot;. The foundation sells maps and guide books, offers trip planning advice, offers equipment hire and runs courses on camp cooking and navigation.

Most people choose to walk sections of the track for one or a few days at a time. Hardy walkers who walk the track from beginning to end typically do so in 6 to 8 weeks, although it has been completed in under 12 days. The most popular time to walk the track is during the wildflower season of spring (September – November), going from north to south as the wildflower season starts later in the southern areas. In summer the weather can be very hot and water will be hard to find except in the water tanks at the campsites. Winter can be wet, especially in the southern areas but people walk the track any time from March to December.

<text>The Heysen Trail is a long distance walking trail in South Australia. It runs from Parachilna Gorge, in the Flinders Ranges via the Adelaide Hills to Cape Jervis on the Fleurieu Peninsula and is approximately in length.

==Route summary==
From north to south, the route of the trail may be summarised by the following landmarks in order: Parachilna Gorge - Flinders Ranges National Park - Hawker - Quorn - Mount Remarkable National Park - Melrose - Crystal Brook - Spalding - Burra - Kapunda - Adelaide Hills - Deep Creek Conservation Park - Cape Jervis

Due to bushfire risk, large sections of the trail are closed annually from December through to April.

Most people choose to walk sections of the track for one or a few days at a time. There are many places to stay along the trail and hardy walkers who walk the track from beginning to end typically do so in about 60 days.

The &quot;Friends of the Heysen Trail&quot; is a non-profit volunteer organisation dedicated to the maintenance, development and promotion of the Heysen Trail and other walking trails; and to the promotion of bushwalking as a healthy leisure activity.

A regular walking program is conducted by a walking sub-committee. Different grades of walks cater for beginners and for more experienced walkers.

==Geology and biology==

The trail passes cliffs, farmland, natural bushland, forests, vineyards, and grazing land. It extends from the ocean through the fertile Mount Lofty Ranges across Goyder&#x27;s Line to the arid Flinders Ranges, with many different bioregions.

==History==
The trail was first suggested by Warren Bonython in 1969 but design was stalled by several years due to government politics and issues with private land owners. The first 50 kilometres of the track was laid through the Mount Lofty Ranges in 1978 after responsibility for the track was handed to the Department of Recreation and Sport. Terry Lavender was the main designer for the track and oversaw the majority of its construction until it was completed in 1992.

The trail is named after Sir Hans Heysen.

<text>The Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) is an executive agency within the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA). It is responsible for conservation of Northern Ireland&#x27;s environment and natural heritage.

Originally part of the Department of the Environment (DOENI), the agency was called the Environment and Heritage Service (EHS) until 1 July 2008, and also had responsibility for the historic environment. On 16 May 2016 the DOENI was dissolved and NIEA became part of DAERA. At the same time, the historic environment functions of NIEA were transferred to the Department for Communities.

NIEA is responsible for a range of protected areas in Northern Ireland, including eight areas of outstanding natural beauty, 47 national nature reserves, 43 special areas of conservation, and 10 special protection areas. The NIEA employs 630 people as of 2020.

<text>A lawsuit is a proceeding by one or more parties (the plaintiff or claimant) against one or more parties (the defendant) in a civil court of law. The archaic term &quot;suit in law&quot; is found in only a small number of laws still in effect today. The term &quot;lawsuit&quot; is used with respect to a civil action brought by a plaintiff (a party who claims to have incurred loss as a result of a defendant&#x27;s actions) who requests a legal remedy or equitable remedy from a court. The defendant is required to respond to the plaintiff&#x27;s complaint or else risk default judgment. If the plaintiff is successful, judgment is entered in favor of the plaintiff, and the Court may impose the legal and/or equitable remedies available against the defendant (respondent). A variety of court orders may be issued in connection with or as part of the judgment to enforce a right, award damages or restitution, or impose a temporary or permanent injunction to prevent an act or compel an act. A declaratory judgment may be issued to prevent future legal disputes.

A lawsuit may involve resolution of disputes involving issues of private law between individuals, business entities or non-profit organizations. A lawsuit may also involve issues of public law in the sense that the state is treated as if it were a private party in a civil case, either as a plaintiff with a civil cause of action to enforce certain laws or as a defendant in actions contesting the legality of the state&#x27;s laws or seeking monetary damages for injuries caused by agents of the state.

Conducting a civil action is called litigation. The plaintiffs and defendants are called litigants and the attorneys representing them are called litigators. The term litigation may also refer to the conducting of criminal actions (see criminal procedure).

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;lawsuit&quot; derives from the combination of law and suit. Suit derives from the Old French &quot;suite, sieute&quot; meaning to pursue or follow. This term was derived from the Latin &quot;secutus&quot;, the past participle of &quot;sequi&quot; meaning to attend or follow.

Similarly, the word &quot;sue&quot;, derives from the Old French &quot;suir, sivre&quot; meaning to pursue or follow after. This was also derived from the Latin word &quot;sequi&quot;.

== Rules of procedure and complications ==
Rules of criminal or civil procedure govern the conduct of a lawsuit in the common law adversarial system of dispute resolution. Procedural rules arise from statutory law, case law, and constitutional provisions (especially the right to due process). The details of each kind of legal procedure differ greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and often from court to court even within the same jurisdiction. It is important for litigants to be aware of all relevant procedural rules (or to hire competent counsel who can either comply with such rules on their behalf or explain the rules to them), because the litigants ultimately dictate the timing and progression of the lawsuit. Litigants are responsible for obtaining the desired result and the timing of reaching this result. Failure to comply with procedural rules may result in serious limitations that can affect the ability of one to present claims or defenses at any subsequent trial, or even lead to the dismissal of the lawsuit altogether.

Though the majority of lawsuits are settled before ever reaching trial, they can still be very complicated to litigate. This is particularly true in federal systems, where a federal court may be applying state law (e.g. the &quot;Erie&quot; doctrine, for example in the United States), or vice versa. It is also possible for one state to apply the law of another in cases where additionally it may not be clear which level (or location) of court actually has jurisdiction over the claim or personal jurisdiction over the defendant, or whether the plaintiff has standing to participate in a lawsuit. About 98 percent of civil cases in the United States federal courts are resolved without a trial. Domestic courts are also often called upon to apply foreign law, or to act upon foreign defendants, over whom they may not even have the ability to enforce a judgment if the defendant&#x27;s assets are theoretically outside their reach.

Lawsuits can become additionally complicated as more parties become involved (see joinder). Within a &quot;single&quot; lawsuit, there can be any number of claims and defenses (all based on numerous laws) between any number of plaintiffs or defendants. Each of these participants can bring any number of cross-claims and counterclaims against each other, and even bring additional parties into the suit on either side after it progresses. In reality, however, courts typically have some power to sever claims and parties into separate actions if it is more efficient to do so. A court can do this if there is not a sufficient overlap of factual issues between the various associates, separating the issues into different lawsuits.

The official ruling of a lawsuit can be somewhat misleading because post-ruling outcomes are often not listed on the internet. For example, in the case of William J. Ralph Jr. v. Lind-Waldock &amp; Company (September 1999), one would assume that Ralph lost the case when in fact, upon review of the evidence, it was found that Ralph was correct in his assertion that improper activity took place on the part of Lind-Waldock, and Ralph settled with Lind-Waldock.

Cases such as this illustrate the need for more comprehensive information than mere internet searches when researching legal decisions. While online searches are appropriate for many legal situations, they are not appropriate for all.

==Procedure==
The following is a generalized description of how a lawsuit may proceed in a common law jurisdiction:

===Pleading===
A lawsuit begins when a complaint or petition, known as a pleading, is filed with the court. A complaint should explicitly state that one or more plaintiffs seek(s) damages or equitable relief from one or more stated defendants, and also should state the relevant factual allegations supporting the legal claims brought by the plaintiffs. As the initial pleading, a complaint is the most important step in a civil case because a complaint sets the factual and legal foundation for the entirety of a case. While complaints and other pleadings may ordinarily be amended by a motion with the court, the complaint sets the framework for the entire case and the claims that will be asserted throughout the entire lawsuit.

It is likewise important that the plaintiff select the proper venue with the proper jurisdiction to bring the lawsuit. The clerk of a court signs or stamps the court seal upon a summons or citation, which is then served by the plaintiff upon the defendant, together with a copy of the complaint. This service notifies the defendants that they are being sued and that they are limited in the amount of time to reply. The service provides a copy of the complaint to notify the defendants of the nature of the claims. Once the defendants are served with the summons and complaint, they are subject to a time limit to file an answer stating their defenses to the plaintiff&#x27;s claims, which includes any challenges to the court&#x27;s jurisdiction, and any counterclaims they wish to assert against the plaintiff.

In a handful of jurisdictions (notably, the U.S. state of New York) a lawsuit begins when one or more plaintiffs properly serve a summons and complaint upon the defendants. In such jurisdictions, nothing must be filed with the court until a dispute develops requiring actual judicial intervention.

If the defendant chooses to file an answer within the time permitted, the answer must address each of the plaintiffs&#x27; allegations. The defendant has three choices to make, which include either admitting to the allegation, denying it, or pleading a lack of sufficient information to admit or deny the allegation. Some jurisdictions, like California and Florida, still authorize general denials of each and every allegation in the complaint. At the time the defendant files an answer, the defendant also raises all &quot;affirmative&quot; defenses. The defendant may also assert counterclaims for damages or equitable relief against the plaintiff. For example, in the case of &quot;compulsory counterclaims,&quot; the defendant must assert some form of counterclaim or risk having the counterclaim barred in any subsequent proceeding. In the case of making a counterclaim, the defendant is making a motion directed towards the plaintiff claiming that he/she was injured in some way or would like to sue the plaintiff. The plaintiff in this example would then receive some amount of time to make a reply to this counterclaim. The defendant may also file a &quot;third party complaint&quot;, which is the defendant&#x27;s privilege to join another party or parties in the action with the belief that those parties may be liable for some or all of the plaintiff&#x27;s claimed damages. An answer from the defendant in response to the claims made against him/her, can also include additional facts or a so-called &quot;excuse&quot; for the plead. Filing an answer &quot;joins the cause&quot; and moves the case into the pre-trial phase.

Instead of filing an answer within the time specified in the summons, the defendant can choose to dispute the validity of the complaint by filing a demurrer (in the handful of jurisdictions where that is still allowed) or one or more &quot;pre-answer motions,&quot; such as a motion to dismiss. It is important that the motion be filed within the time period specified in the summons for an answer. If all of the above motions are denied by the trial court, and the defendant loses on all appeals from such denials (if that option is available), and finally the defendant &quot;must&quot; file an answer.

Usually the pleadings are drafted by a lawyer, but in many courts persons can file papers and represent themselves, which is called appearing &quot;pro se&quot;. Many courts have a &quot;pro se&quot; clerk to assist people without lawyers.

===Pretrial discovery===
A pretrial discovery can be defined as &quot;the formal process of exchanging information between the parties about the witnesses and evidence they&#x27;ll present at trial&quot; and allows for the evidence of the trial to be presented to the parties before the initial trial begins. The early stages of the lawsuit may involve initial disclosures of evidence by each party and discovery, which is the structured exchange of evidence and statements between the parties. Discovery is meant to eliminate surprises, clarify what the lawsuit is about, and also to make the parties decide if they should settle or drop frivolous claims or defenses. At this point, the parties may also engage in pretrial motions to exclude or include particular legal or factual issues before trial.

There is also the ability of one to make an under-oath statement during the pretrial, also known as a deposition. The deposition can be used in the trial or just in the pretrial, but this allows for both parties to be aware of the arguments or claims that are going to be made by the other party in the trial. It is notable that the depositions can be written or oral.

At the close of discovery, the parties may either pick a jury and then have a trial by jury or the case may proceed as a bench trial. A bench trial is only heard by the judge if the parties waive a jury trial or if the right to a jury trial is not guaranteed for their particular claim (such as those under equity in the U.S.) or for any lawsuits within their jurisdiction.

===Resolution===
Usually, lawsuits end in a settlement, with an empirical analysis finding that less than 2% of cases end with a trial. It is sometimes said that 95% of cases end in settlement; few jurisdictions report settlements, but empirical analysis suggests that the settlement rate varies by type of lawsuit, with torts settling around 90% of the time and overall civil cases settling 50% of the time; other cases end due to default judgment, lack of a valid claim, and other reasons.

At trial, each person presents witnesses and the evidence collected is recorded. After this occurs, the judge or jury renders their decision. Generally speaking, the plaintiff has the burden of proof in making his claims, however, the defendant may have the burden of proof on other issues, such as affirmative defenses. The attorneys are held responsible in devising a trial strategy that ensures they meet the necessary elements of their case or (when the opposing party has the burden of proof) to ensure the opponent will not be able to meet his or her burden.

There are numerous motions that either party can file throughout the lawsuit to terminate it &quot;prematurely&quot;—before submission to the judge or jury for final consideration. These motions attempt to persuade the judge, through legal argument and sometimes accompanying evidence, that there is no reasonable way that the other party could legally win and therefore there is no sense in continuing with the trial. Motions for summary judgment, for example, can usually be brought before, after, or during the actual presentation of the case. Motions can also be brought after the close of a trial to undo a jury verdict contrary to law or against the weight of the evidence, or to convince the judge to change the decision or grant a new trial.

Also, at any time during this process from the filing of the complaint to the final judgment, the plaintiff may withdraw the complaint and end the whole matter, or the defendant may agree to a settlement. If the case settles, the parties might choose to enter into a stipulated judgment with the settlement agreement attached, or the plaintiff may simply file a voluntary dismissal, so that the settlement agreement is never entered into the court record.

The decisions that the jury makes are not put into effect until the judge makes a judgment, which is the approval to have this trial information be filed in public records. In a civil case, the judge is allowed at this time to make changes to the verdict that the jury came up with by either adding on or reducing the punishment. In criminal cases the situation is a little different, because in this case the judge does not have the authority to change the jury decision.

===Appeal===
After a final decision has been made, either party or both may appeal from the judgment if they believe there had been a procedural error made by the trial court. It is not necessarily an automatic appeal after every judgment has been made, however, if there is a legal basis for the appeal, then one has the right to do so. The prevailing party may appeal, for example, if they wanted a larger award than was granted. The appellate court (which may be structured as an intermediate appellate court) and/or a higher court then affirms the judgment, declines to hear it (which effectively affirms it), reverses—or vacates and remands. This process would then involve sending the lawsuit back to the lower trial court to address an unresolved issue, or possibly request for a whole new trial. Some lawsuits go up and down the appeals ladder repeatedly before final resolution.

The appeal is a review for errors rather than a new trial, so the appellate court will defer to the discretion of the original trial court if an error is not clear. The initial step in making an appeal consists of the petitioner filing a notice of appeal and then sending in a brief, a written document stating reason for appeal, to the court. Decisions of the court can be made immediately after just reading the written brief, or there can also be oral arguments made by both parties involved in the appeal. The appellate court then makes the decision about what errors were made when the law was looked at more closely in the lower court. There were no errors made, the case would then end, but if the decision was reversed, the appellate court would then send the case back down to the lower court level. There, a new trial will be held and new information taken into account.

Some jurisdictions, notably the United States, but prevalent in many other countries, prevent parties from relitigating the facts on appeal, due to a history of unscrupulous lawyers deliberately reserving such issues in order to ambush each other in the appellate courts (the &quot;invited error&quot; problem). The idea is that it is more efficient to force all parties to fully litigate all relevant issues of fact before the trial court. Thus, a party who does not raise an issue of fact at the trial court level generally cannot raise it on appeal.

When the lawsuit is finally resolved, or the allotted time to appeal has expired, the matter is &quot;res judicata&quot;, meaning the plaintiff may not bring another action based on the same claim again. In addition, other parties who later attempt to re-litigate a matter already ruled on in a previous lawsuit will be &quot;estopped&quot; from doing so.

===Enforcement===
When a final judgment is entered, the plaintiff is usually barred under the doctrine of &quot;res judicata&quot; from relitigating any of the issues, even under different legal theories. Judgments are typically a monetary award. If the defendant fails to pay, the court has various powers to seize any of the defendant&#x27;s assets located within its jurisdiction, such as:

* Writ of execution
* Bank account garnishment
* Liens
* Wage garnishment

If all assets are located elsewhere, the plaintiff must file another suit in the appropriate court to seek enforcement of the other court&#x27;s previous judgment. This can be a difficult task when crossing from a court in one state or nation to another, however, courts tend to grant each other respect when there is not a clear legal rule to the contrary. A defendant who has no assets in &quot;any&quot; jurisdiction is said to be &quot;judgment-proof.&quot; The term is generally a colloquialism to describe an impecunious defendant.

Indigent judgment-proof defendants are no longer imprisoned; debtor&#x27;s prisons have been outlawed by statute, constitutional amendment, or international human rights treaties in the vast majority of common law jurisdictions.

== Research in law, economics and management ==
Scholars in law, economics and management have studied why firms involved in a dispute choose between private dispute resolution—such as negotiation, mediation, and arbitration—and litigation.

==Terminology==
During the 18th and 19th centuries, it was common for lawyers to speak of bringing an &quot;action&quot; at law and a &quot;suit&quot; in equity. An example of that distinction survives today in the codified text of the Ku Klux Klan Act. The fusion of common law and equity in England in the Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875 led to the collapse of that distinction, so it became possible to speak of a &quot;lawsuit.&quot; In the United States, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (1938) abolished the distinction between actions at law and suits in equity in federal practice, in favor of a single form referred to as a &quot;civil action.&quot;

In England and Wales the term &quot;claim&quot; is far more common; the person initiating proceedings is called the claimant. England and Wales began to turn away from traditional common law terminology with the Rules of the Supreme Court (1883), in which the &quot;statement of claim&quot; and &quot;defence&quot; replaced the traditional complaint and answer as the pleadings by which parties placed their case at issue before the trial court. 

American terminology is slightly different, in that the term &quot;claim&quot; refers only to a particular count or cause of action alleged in a complaint. Similarly, &quot;defense&quot; refers to only one or more affirmative defenses alleged in an answer. Americans also use &quot;claim&quot; to describe an extrajudicial demand filed with an insurer or administrative agency. If the claim is denied, then the claimant, policyholder, or applicant files a lawsuit with the courts to seek review of that decision, and from that point forward participates in the lawsuit as a plaintiff. In other words, the terms &quot;claimant&quot; and &quot;plaintiff&quot; carry substantially different connotations of formality in American English, in that only the latter risks an award of costs in favor of an adversary in a lawsuit.

In medieval times, both &quot;action&quot; and &quot;suit&quot; had the approximate meaning of some kind of legal proceeding, but an action terminated when a judgment was rendered, while a suit also included the execution of the judgment.

==Financing==

Particularly in the United States, plaintiffs and defendants who lack financial resources for litigation or other attorney&#x27;s fees may be able to obtain legal financing. Legal financing companies can provide a cash advance to litigants in return for a share of the ultimate settlement or award. If the case ultimately loses, the litigant does not have to pay any of the money funded back. Legal financing is different from a typical bank loan in that the legal financing company does not look at credit history or employment history. Litigants do not have to repay the cash advance with monthly payments, but do have to fill out an application so that the legal financing company can review the merits of the case.

Legal financing can be a practical means for litigants to obtain financing while they wait for a monetary settlement or an award in their personal injury, workers&#x27; compensation, or civil rights lawsuit. Often, plaintiffs who were injured or forced to leave their jobs still have mortgages, rent, medical expenses, or other bills to pay. Other times, litigants may simply need money to pay for the costs of litigation and attorneys&#x27; fees, and for this reason, many litigants turn to reputable legal financing companies to apply for a cash advance to help pay for bills.

Defendants, civil rights organizations, public interest organizations, and government public officials can all set up an account to pay for litigation costs and legal expenses. These legal defense funds can have large membership counts where the members contribute to the fund. Unlike legal financing from legal financing companies, legal defense funds provide a separate account for litigation rather than a one-time cash advancement, nevertheless, both are used for purposes of financing litigation and legal costs.

There was a study conducted in the &quot;Supreme Court Economic Review&quot; that shows why litigation financing can be practical and beneficial to the overall court system and lawsuits within the court. This study concluded that the new rules that were set for litigation financing actually did produce more settlements. Under conservative rules, there tended to be fewer settlements, however under the older rules they tended to be larger on average.

Legal financing can become an issue in some cases, varying from case to case and person to person. It can be beneficial in many situations, however also detrimental in others.

<doc id="113260" wikidata="Q103093" url="?curid=113260" title="Västra Götaland County">
<text>Västra Götaland County () is a county or &quot;län&quot; on the western coast of Sweden.

The county is the second most populous of Sweden&#x27;s counties and it comprises 49 municipalities (&quot;kommuner&quot;). Its population of 1,616,000 amounts to 17% of Sweden&#x27;s population. The formal capital and seat of the governor of Västra Götaland County is Gothenburg. The political capital and seat of the Västra Götaland Regional Council is Vänersborg.

The county was established on 1 January 1998, when Älvsborg County, Gothenburg and Bohus County and Skaraborg County were merged.

== Provinces ==
Sweden&#x27;s counties are generally of greater importance than its provinces. The counties are the main administrative units for politics and population census counts.

Due to its size and young age, the Västra Götaland County has no common heritage. Of cultural and historical significance are the provinces that Västra Götaland County consists of: Västergötland, Bohuslän and Dalsland. There is also an insignificant part of the province Halland within the county.

In addition, the previous counties that were abolished in 1998 had been in use since the 17th century, and therefore have some cultural and historical significance.

== Neighbours ==
Västra Götaland County borders to the counties of Värmland, Örebro, Östergötland, Jönköping and Halland. It is also bounded by the Norwegian county of Østfold both with a land and maritime border, lakes Vättern and Vänern, as well as the strait of Skagerrak.

== Administration ==
Västra Götaland was created in 1998 by a merger of the three former counties of Gothenburg and Bohus County, Älvsborg County and Skaraborg County. The seat of residence for the Governors or &quot;Landshövding&quot; is Gothenburg, while the seat of political administration and power is Vänersborg. The Governor is the head of the County Administrative Board or &quot;Länsstyrelse&quot;.

== Politics ==
The Västra Götaland Regional Council or &quot;Västra Götalandsregionen&quot; is an evolved County Council that for a trial period has assumed certain tasks from the County Administrative Board. Similar trial councils are applied for Skåne County and Gotland County.

== Heraldry ==
The arms for the County of Västra Götaland were granted in 1998 when the county was formed. They are a combination of the provincial arms of Västergötland, Bohuslän and Dalsland and the arms of the city of Gothenburg. When the arms are shown with a royal crown they represent the County Administrative Board, which is the regional presence of (royal) government authority. Blazon: &quot;Quartered, I. the arms of Gothenburg II. the arms of Bohuslän III. the arms of Dalsland turned in courtoisie, IV. the arms of Västergötland.&quot;

<text>A nature reserve (also known as a wildlife refuge, wildlife sanctuary, biosphere reserve or bioreserve, natural or nature preserve, or nature conservation area) is a protected area of importance for flora, fauna, funga, or features of geological or other special interest, which is reserved and managed for purposes of conservation and to provide special opportunities for study or research. They may be designated by government institutions in some countries, or by private landowners, such as charities and research institutions. Nature reserves fall into different IUCN categories depending on the level of protection afforded by local laws. Normally it is more strictly protected than a nature park. Various jurisdictions may use other terminology, such as ecological protection area or private protected area in legislation and in official titles of the reserves.

== History ==

Cultural practices that roughly equate to the establishment and maintenance of reserved areas for animals date back to antiquity, with King Devanampiya Tissa of Sri Lanka establishing Mihintale wildlife sanctuary, one of the world&#x27;s earliest wildlife sanctuaries, in the 3rd-century-BC Anuradhapura Ancient Kingdom. Early reservations often had a religious underpinning, such as the &#x27;evil forest&#x27; areas of West Africa which were forbidden to humans, who were threatened with spiritual attack if they went there. Sacred areas taboo from human entry to fishing and hunting are known by many ancient cultures worldwide.

The world&#x27;s first modern nature reserve was established in 1821 by the naturalist and explorer Charles Waterton around his estate in Walton Hall, West Yorkshire. He spent £9000 on the construction of a three-mile long, 9 ft tall wall to enclose his park against poachers. He tried to encourage bird life by planting trees and hollowing out trunks for owls to nest in.
Waterton invented artificial nest boxes to house starlings, western jackdaws and sand martins; and unsuccessfully attempted to introduce little owls from Italy. Waterton allowed local people access to his reserve and was described by David Attenborough as &quot;one of the first people anywhere to recognise not only that the natural world was of great importance but that it needed protection as humanity made more and more demands on it&quot;.

Drachenfels was protected as the first state-designated nature reserve in modern-day Germany; the site was bought by the Prussian State in 1836 to protect it from further quarrying.

The first major nature reserve was Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, United States, followed by the Royal National Park near Sydney, Australia, and the Barguzin Nature Reserve of Imperial Russia, the first of &quot;zapovedniks&quot; set up by a federal government entirely for the scientific study of nature.

== Around the world ==

There are several national and international organizations that oversee the numerous non-profit animal sanctuaries and refuges to provide a general system for sanctuaries to follow. Among them, the American Sanctuary Association monitors and aids in various facilities to care for exotic wildlife. The number of sanctuaries has substantially increased over the past few years.

=== Australia ===

In Australia, a nature reserve is the title of a type of protected area used in the jurisdictions of the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Tasmania and Western Australia. The term &quot;nature reserve&quot; is defined in the relevant statutes used in those states and territories rather than by a single national statute. As of 2016, 1767 out of a total of 11044 protected areas listed within the Australian National Reserve System used the term &quot;nature reserve&quot; in their names.

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, nature reserves are classified by the National System of Nature Conservation Units as ecological stations () or biological reserves (). Their main objectives are preserving fauna and flora and other natural attributes, excluding direct human interference. Visits are allowed only with permission, and only for educational or scientific purposes. Changes to the ecosystems in both types of reserve are allowed to restore and preserve the natural balance, biological diversity and natural ecological processes. Ecological stations are also allowed to change the environment within strictly defined limits (e.g. affecting no more than three percent of the area or , whichever is less) for the purpose of scientific research.
A wildlife reserve in Brazil is also protected, and hunting is not allowed, but products and by-products from research may be sold.

Wildlife refuges in Brazil have as their objective the protection of natural flora and fauna where conditions are assured for the existence and reproduction of species or communities of the local flora and the resident or migratory fauna. The refuges can consist of privately owned land, as long as the objectives of the unit are compatible with the landowners&#x27; usage of the land and natural resources. Public visits are subject to the conditions and restrictions established by the management plan of the unit and are subject to authorisation by and regulations of the main administrative and scientific research body.

=== Canada ===
The Niagara Escarpment and the St. Lawrence River in Ontario are among the 18 nature reserves recognized by UNESCO in Canada.

As a federal government, Canada recognizes 55 National Wildlife Areas, containing species of ecological significance. This area is protected by legislation known as the Canada Wildlife Act, which is overseen by the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change. About half of the habitat is marine habitat, and the remainder is terrestrial habitat.

Nature Conservancy Canada, Ducks Unlimited, and Escarpment Biosphere Conservancy, among others, protect nature reserves in Canada as well. As part of Canada&#x27;s Ecological Gifts Program, these charities protect wilderness on privately owned lands.

=== Egypt ===
There are 30 nature reserves in Egypt which cover 12% of Egyptian land. Those nature reserves were built according to the laws no. 102/1983 and 4/1994 for protection of the Egyptian nature reserve. Egypt announced a plan from to build 40 nature reserves from 1997 to 2017, to help protect the natural resources and the culture and history of those areas. The largest nature reserve in Egypt is Gebel Elba () in the southeast, on the Red Sea coast.

=== Eritrea === 
On 16 March 1959, the British established the Yob Wildlife Reserve in northern Eritrea specifically to protect significant populations of Nubian ibex in the area.

==== Hungary ====
In Hungary, there are 10 national parks, more than 15 nature reserves and more than 250 protected areas.
Hortobágy National Park is the largest continuous natural grassland in Europe and the oldest national park in Hungary. It is situated on the eastern part of Hungary, on the plain of the Alföld. It was established in 1972. There are alkaline grasslands interrupted by marshes. They have a sizable importance because there are the fishponds. One of the most spectacular sights of the park is the autumn migration of cranes. Some famous Hungarian animal species live in Hortobágy National Park, such as the grey cattle, racka long-wool sheep living only in Hungary, Hungarian horses and buffalo. Hortobágy National Park has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1 December 1999.

==== Kosovo ====

In Kosovo, there are 2 national parks, 11 nature reserves, 99 natural monuments and 3 protected landscapes. The national parks are Bjeshkët e Nemuna National Park and Sharr Mountains National Park.
==== Poland ====

As of 2011, Poland has 1469 nature reserves.

==== Portugal ====

==== Romania ====

About 5.18% of the area of Romania has a protected status (), including the Danube Delta, which makes up half of this area (2.43% of Romania&#x27;s total area).

==== Spain ====
There are 15 National Parks, and around 90 Natural Parks in Spain. Spain is the country with the most sites listed in the World Network of Biosphere Reserves.

==== Ukraine ====
There are 4 biosphere reserves (two of them are dated 1927 and 1874) and 17 nature reserves in Ukraine, covering . Ukraine administers 40 national parks, 2632 habitat management areas, 3025 nature monuments, and 1430 other preservations.

==== United Kingdom ====
There are some differences between the regulations for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, which are separately managed.

At the end of March 2004, there were 215 national nature reserves in England with a total area of . The reserves are scattered through England, from Lindisfarne in Northumberland to The Lizard in Cornwall. Nearly every rural county has at least one. Many national nature reserves contain nationally important populations of rare flowers, ferns and mosses, butterflies and other insects, and nesting and wintering birds. Examples include unique alpine plants at Upper Teesdale and the field of snake&#x27;s head fritillaries at North Meadow, Cricklade, Wiltshire.

There are now over 1,050 local nature reserves in England. They range from windswept coastal headlands, ancient woodlands and flower-rich meadows to former inner-city railways, long-abandoned landfill sites and industrial areas now re-colonized by wildlife. In total, they cover almost —a natural resource which makes an important contribution to England&#x27;s biodiversity. A good example is Rye Harbour Nature Reserve in East Sussex, where a network of footpaths enables visitors to explore shingle, saltmarsh, saline lagoon, reedbed, and grazing marsh habitats.

Through the Natural Heritage (Scotland) Act 1991 the Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) was established in 1992 as a government body, responsible to the Scottish Government Ministers and through them to the Scottish Parliament. At 31 March 2008, there were 65 Scottish national nature reserves with a total area of approximately . Section 21 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 gives local authorities the exclusive statutory power to establish a local nature reserve in consultation with the SNH.

=== Iran===
The biosphere reserves of Iran have a total land area of 1.64 million km2. The &quot;reserves&quot; support more than 8,000 recorded species of plants (almost 2,421 are endemic), 502 species of birds, 164 species of mammals, 209 species of reptiles, and 375 species of butterflies.

=== India ===

India&#x27;s 18 biospheres extend over a total of and protect larger areas than typical national parks in other countries. The first national reserve of India was established in 1986.

=== Israel ===

Israel&#x27;s national parks are declared historic sites or nature reserves, which are mostly operated and maintained by the National Nature and Parks Authority. As of 2019, Israel maintains more than 490 nature reserves that protect 2,500 species of indigenous wild plants, 20 species of fish, 530 species of birds and 70 species of mammals. In total, they cover of nature reserves, approximately 28% of the country&#x27;s land area. In 1984, the two areas with the highest number of nature reserves were the South (15.2%) and Samaria (the Shomron, 13.5%).

=== Japan ===
Under the Nature Conservation Law, places can be designated as &#x27;wilderness areas&#x27;, &#x27;nature conservation areas&#x27; and &#x27;prefectural nature conservation areas&#x27;. In 1995, when the Japanese Government published its information in English, there were 5 wilderness areas, 10 nature conservation areas and 516 prefectural nature conservation areas.

=== Jordan ===
There are seven nature reserves in Jordan. In 1966 the organization that would later start Jordan&#x27;s nature reserves, the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature, was founded. RSCN&#x27;s first efforts involved bringing back severely endangered species. In 1973, RSCN was given the right to issue hunting licenses, giving RSCN an upper hand in preventing extinction. The first step was the founding of Jordan&#x27;s first nature reserve, Shaumari Wildlife Reserve, in 1975. The primary purpose was to create means to breed endangered species, specifically: the Arabian oryx, gazelles, ostriches, and Persian onagers in their natural environment.

=== Kyrgyzstan ===
By the end of 2009 there were 10 nature reserves (, ) in Kyrgyzstan covering or about three percent of the total area of the country.

=== New Zealand ===
New Zealand has a variety of types of reserve, including national parks, various types of conservation areas (including stewardship land that is yet to be officially classified), and seven specific types of &quot;reserve&quot;, each of which prioritize various degrees of protection to different amenities such as scenery, recreation, flora and fauna, scientific value, or history. Land is often sub-categorised beneath its general classification, as defined in law between the &quot;Reserves Act of 1977&quot;, the &quot;National Parks Act of 1980&quot;, and the &quot;Conservation Act of 1987&quot;. Under these classifications, the Department of Conservation administers more than —nearly 30% of the nation&#x27;s total area—with at least some degree of protection. This land is composed of 14 National Parks, 30 Conservation Parks, and approximately 8,900 discrete areas of land in total.

Although the most public land is strongly protected for natural preservation, the term &quot;nature reserve&quot; is specifically defined in the Reserves Act to mean a reserve that prioritizes the protection of rare flora and fauna, to the extent that public access is by permit only. Some of these reserves include Ecological Islands, a comparatively new concept in wildlife preservation, pioneered in New Zealand to help rebuild the populations of nearly extinct birds, and other species that are heavily threatened by introduced predators.

=== Nicaragua ===
In Nicaragua, the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (MARENA) is in charge of environmental protection and of the study, planning, and management of Nicaragua&#x27;s natural resources. Nearly one-fifth of the territory is designated as protected areas like national parks, nature reserves (including the Bosawás Biosphere Reserve), and biological reserves. Nicaragua has 78 protected areas that cover , about 17.3% of the nation&#x27;s landmass. Private nature reserves exist with land excluded from private land trusts and maintained at the sole cost of the proprietor. For example, O Parks, WildLife, and Recreation, Or El Ostional Private Wildlife Reserve, was established within the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor by retired FDNY firefighter Kevin Michael Shea, who purchased of land for the purpose of restoring the ecological system of a dry tropical forest, ravaged during the Nicaraguan Revolution. The park provides a private nature reserve, wildlife corridor and verified carbon credits.

=== Russia ===
There are around 100 nature reserves () in Russia, covering some , or about 1.4% of the country&#x27;s total area. A few of them predate the October Revolution of 1917, but most have been created during the Soviet Union era. There are also natural protected areas where only certain species are protected, or only certain activities are prohibited; those are known as &quot;zakaznik&quot; ().

Unofficial sanctuaries can also occur as a result of human accidents; the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has in practice become a wildlife refuge since very few people live in the area. Wildlife has flourished in the zone since the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986.

=== South Africa ===

South Africa is well known for its many nature reserves. The oldest nature reserve in the country (and oldest conservation area in the world) is the Groenkloof Nature Reserve that was established in 1892 in the capital city Pretoria in the old South African Republic and current Republic of South Africa.

The country has many national parks but the best-known is the Kruger National Park, which was announced in 1898, and is the largest, at nearly . The Kruger Park and Table Mountain National Park are two of South Africa&#x27;s most visited tourist attractions, along with the Addo Elephant National Park.

South Africa also has 10 World Heritage Sites, including four natural sites and one mixed site. And it has provincial game reserves including Shamwari, Londolozi, Sanbona and Lalibela. The country currently has 20 national parks covering , about 3% of the total area of South Africa.

The Prince Edward Islands, which are South African territories in the Southern Ocean, have been declared a special nature reserve. It is a highly protected area from which all human activity is excluded, except for conservation and scientific research.

===Sri Lanka===
The area around Mihintale, Sri Lanka, was a sanctuary for wildlife, probably the first of its generation in the ancient world. According to stone inscriptions found in the vicinity, the king commanded the people not to harm animals or destroy trees within the area.

=== United States ===
In the United States, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, managed by the Secretary of the Interior, is responsible for managing many of the federal nature reserves including the National Wildlife Refuge System. The National Wildlife Refuge System includes areas administered for the protection and conservation of fish and wildlife that are threatened with extinction, as well as wildlife ranges, game ranges, wildlife management areas, and waterfowl production areas.

The first North American wildlife refuge, Lake Merritt Wildlife sanctuary at Lake Merritt, was established by Samuel Merritt and enacted in California state law in 1870 as the first government owned refuge. The first federally owned refuge in the United States is Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge and was established by Theodore Roosevelt in 1903 as part of his Square Deal campaign to improve the country. At the time, setting aside land for wildlife was not a constitutional right of the president. In 2006, a bi-partisan group of US House of Representatives members established the Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus to further support the needs of the National Wildlife Refuge System in Congress.

There are also state-level administered State Nature Reserves found throughout the country, as well as smaller reserves operated by local governments, private trusts, or even funded through public donations. Private nature reserves also exist, with land excluded from private land trusts and maintained at the sole cost of the proprietor, such as the Wilbur Hot Springs.

<text>Diprotodontia (, from Greek &quot;two forward teeth&quot;) is the largest extant order of marsupials, with about 155 species, including the kangaroos, wallabies, possums, koala, wombats, and many others. Extinct diprotodonts include the hippopotamus-sized &quot;Diprotodon&quot;, and &quot;Thylacoleo&quot;, the so-called &quot;marsupial lion&quot;.

==Characteristics==
Living diprotodonts are almost all herbivores, as were most of those that are now extinct. A few insectivorous and omnivorous diprotodonts are known, and the Potoroidae are almost unique among vertebrates in being largely fungivorous, but these seem to have arisen as relatively recent adaptations from the mainstream herbivorous lifestyle. The extinct thylacoleonids (&quot;marsupial lions&quot;) are the only known group to have exhibited carnivory on a large scale.

Diprotodonts are restricted to Australasia. The earliest known fossils date to the late Oligocene, but their genesis certainly lies earlier than this, as large gaps occur in Australia&#x27;s fossil record, with virtually no fossil record at all in geologically active New Guinea. The great diversity of known Oligocene diprotodonts suggests the order began to diverge well beforehand.

Many of the largest and least athletic diprotodonts (along with a wide range of other Australian megafauna) became extinct when humans first arrived in Australia about 50,000 years ago. Their extinction possibly occurred as a direct result of hunting, but was more probably a result of widespread habitat changes brought about by human activities—notably the use of fire.

Two key anatomical features, in combination, identify Diprotodontia. Members of the order are, first, &quot;diprotodont&quot; (meaning &quot;two front teeth&quot;): they have a pair of large, procumbent incisors on the lower jaw, a common feature of many early groups of mammals and mammaliforms. The diprotodont jaw is short, usually with three pairs of upper incisors (wombats, like rodents have only one pair), and no lower canines. The second trait distinguishing diprotodonts is &quot;syndactyly&quot;, a fusing of the second and third digits of the foot up to the base of the claws, which leaves the claws themselves separate. Digit five is usually absent, and digit four is often greatly enlarged.

Syndactyly is not particularly common (though the Australian omnivorous marsupials share it) and is generally posited as an adaptation to assist in climbing. Many modern diprotodonts, however, are strictly terrestrial, and have evolved further adaptations to their feet to better suit this lifestyle. This makes the history of the tree-kangaroos particularly convoluted: it appears that the animals were arboreal at some time in the far distant past, moving afterward to the ground—gaining long kangaroo-like feet in the process — before returning to the trees, where they further developed a shortening and broadening of the hind feet and a novel climbing method.

==Fossil record==
The earliest known fossil of Diprotodontia dates back to the Late Oligocene (23.03 - 28.4 million years ago), and the earliest identifiable species is &quot;Hypsiprymnodon bartholomaii&quot; from the Early Miocene.

==Classification==

Until recently, only two suborders in Diprotodontia were noted: Vombatiformes which encompassed the wombats and koala and Phalangerida which contained all other families. Kirsch et al. (1997) split the families into three suborders. In addition, the six Phalangeriformes families are split into two superfamilies. The Macropodiformes are probably nested within the Phalangeriformes, though whether they are sister to Phalangeroidea or Petauroidea is debated.

<text>Mölndal Municipality (&quot;Mölndals kommun&quot; or &quot;Mölndals stad&quot;) is a municipality in Västra Götaland in western Sweden, just south of Gothenburg. Its seat is located in Mölndal, which lies within the Gothenburg urban area, and the whole municipality is part of Metropolitan Gothenburg.

In 1911 a &quot;municipalsamhälle&quot; (a kind of borough within a rural municipality, handling matters of urban character) named Mölndal was instituted in the municipality of Fässberg. In 1922 Fässberg was made the &quot;City of Mölndal&quot;. In 1971 it was amalgamated with Kållered and Lindome (the latter transferred from Halland County). At the same time it became a municipality of unitary type, like all others in the country. The municipality prefers, however, to style itself &quot;Mölndals stad&quot; (&quot;City of Mölndal&quot;) as a semi-official name whenever legally possible. This usage has no effect on the status of the municipality.

==Localities==
The municipality has four main parts: Mölndal, Kållered, Lindome and Hällesåker.

*Mölndal has 37,131 inhabitants (a part of the contiguous Gothenburg urban area)
*Kållered has 7,257 inhabitants
*Lindome has 13,364 inhabitants
*Hällesåker has 900 inhabitants

Numbers from 2003.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Mölndal Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 69,838 residents, including 51,607 Swedish citizens of voting age. 48.5% voted for the left coalition and 50.1% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

== Sights of interest ==
* Gunnebo House from the 18th century.
* Fässberg Church from the 19th century

==Notable residents==
* Lars Leksell (1907–1986), physician and neurosurgeon

==Sister cities==
As of September 2023, Mölndal has no twin cities.

<doc id="113264" wikidata="Q1004067" url="?curid=113264" title="Frobisher Bay">
<text>Frobisher Bay is an inlet of the Davis Strait in the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut, Canada. It is located in the southeastern corner of Baffin Island. Its length is about and its width varies from about at its outlet into the Davis Strait to roughly towards its inner end.

The capital of Nunavut, Iqaluit, known as Frobisher Bay from 1942 to 1987, lies near the innermost end of the bay.

==Geography==
Frobisher Bay has a tapered shape formed by two flanking peninsulas, the Hall Peninsula to the northeast, and the Meta Incognita Peninsula to the southwest. The Bay&#x27;s funnel like shape ensures that the tidal variance at Iqaluit each day is about . This shape is due to the large outlet glacier centred over Foxe Basin during the Quaternary glaciation (Pleistocene), which gouged the Bay&#x27;s basin, now flooded by the sea.

Within Frobisher Bay itself are a number of bays, inlets and sounds. Among these are Wayne Bay and Ward Inlet (up towards the far northwestern end), and also Newell Sound, Leach Bay and Kneeland Bay (along the southwest shore). Hamlen Bay, Newton Fiord, Royer Cove, and Waddell Bay are located along the northeast shore. Frobisher Bay&#x27;s whole coastline is marked with innumerable narrow inlets into which flow many small streams. There are high cliffs on both shores, rising to roughly on the northeast shore, and twice that on the southwest shore as a result of the tilting of the Earth&#x27;s crust locally during the early Tertiary.

Frobisher Bay is also studded with islands. These include Hill Island and Faris Island near Iqaluit, Pugh, Pike, Fletcher and Bruce islands at the mouth of Wayne Bay, Augustus Island in Ward Inlet, and Chase, McLean, Gabriel and Nouyarn islands towards the Bay&#x27;s mouth.

==History==
Frobisher Bay is named for the English navigator Sir Martin Frobisher, who, during his search for the Northwest Passage in 1576, became the first European to visit it. Until Hall&#x27;s voyage in 1861, the Bay was thought by Europeans to be a strait separating Baffin Island from another island.

The first Church of England service recorded on North American soil was a celebration of Holy Communion at Frobisher Bay in the last days of August or early September 1578. The Anglican Church of Canada&#x27;s Prayer Book fixes the day of commemoration as September 3. The chaplain on Frobisher&#x27;s voyage was &quot; &#x27;Maister Wolfall (probably Robert Wolfall), minister and preacher&#x27;, who had been charged by Queen Elizabeth &#x27;to serve God twice a day&#x27;.&quot;

With 17,000 employees the hospital is the largest hospital in Sweden by a considerable margin, and the third largest hospital in Europe. It has 2,000 beds distributed across three campuses in Sahlgrenska, Östra, and Mölndal. It provides emergency and basic care for the 700,000 inhabitants of the Göteborg region and offers highly specialised care for the 1.7 million inhabitants of West Sweden. It is named after philanthropist Niclas Sahlgren.

== History ==
Sahlgrenska University Hospital was formed in 1997 by the merger of three hospitals: Sahlgrenska Hospital, Östra Hospital, and Mölndal Hospital. The Sahlgrenska University Hospital has been operated by the Västra Götaland Regional Council since its formation in 1999.

===The Sahlgrenska Academy=== 

Sahlgrenska Academy is the University of Gothenburg&#x27;s faculty of education and research in health sciences. It operates in close conjunction with the university hospital. The academy was formed the 1st of July 2001 by combining the three previous faculties for medicine, odontology and health sciences. Within the academy is the Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, focusing on translational oncology research. The center is a joint effort between the Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg and the Sahlgrenska University Hospital. The long-term goal of the center is to improve the care of cancer patients by facilitating new scientific discoveries and translating these into clinical practice.

Educational programs are available in biomedical, dietitian sciences, physician, nursing, medical specialist, dentist, and medical physicist. With Sahlgrenska academy&#x27;s focus, University of Gothenburg is ranked worldwide 33 and 40 for Clinical medicine and Biomedical sciences respectively in the subject ranking by Academic Ranking of World Universities AWRU Shanghai (2018).

The Sahlgrenska University Hospital in the Webometrics Hospital specific ranking 2017, was 1st in Sweden, 10th in Europe and 41st worldwide.

== Hospitals ==

=== Sahlgrenska Hospital ===
Sahlgrenska Hospital is the oldest and largest hospital in the network. It was founded in 1782 in Sillgatan (now Postgatan) in Gothenburg with a donation by Niclas Sahlgren. In 1823, it was moved to Oterdahl House, today a museum of medical history. In 1855, it was moved again to a building (now named Sociala Huset) in Carolus Dux at Västra Hamngatan and named Allmänna and Sahlgrenska Hospital. Since 1900, it was moved to its present premises in Änggården, and in 1936 it was named the Sahlgrenska Hospital.

On 24 June 2009, a new facility with 312 beds was officially opened. The new facility will enable rebuilding and renovation of older facilities at Sahlgrenska. The facility also features nephrology centre, dialysis, transplantation centre, stroke unit, hematology, and wards for medicine and surgery.

=== Östra Hospital ===

Östra Hospital was built during the 1960s.

=== Mölndal Hospital ===
Mölndal Hospital was completed on 14 May 1924, to replace an old hospital in Mölndals Kvarnby.

=== Högsbo Hospital ===
=== Queen Silvia&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Hospital ===
==Notable people==
* Mats Brännström; professor of obstetrics and gynaecology; leader of the team behind the first successful uterus transplantation.
* Nils Kock; former chief of surgical staff; developer of the Kock pouch surgical procedure.
* Katharina Sunnerhagen, professor of rehabilitation medicine; created guidelines for stroke rehabilitation

==In popular culture==
Lisbeth Salander, a central character in the &quot;Millennium&quot; series by Stieg Larsson, is treated at Sahlgrenska Hospital after being shot.

<doc id="113266" wikidata="Q2183679" url="?curid=113266" title="Joinery">
<text>Joinery is a part of woodworking that involves joining pieces of wood, engineered lumber, or synthetic substitutes (such as laminate), to produce more complex items. Some woodworking joints employ mechanical fasteners, bindings, or adhesives, while others use only wood elements (such as dowels or plain mortise and tenon fittings).

The characteristics of wooden joints—strength, flexibility, toughness, appearance, etc.—derive from the properties of the materials involved and the purpose of the joint. Therefore, different joinery techniques are used to meet differing requirements. For example, the joinery used to construct a house can be different from that used to make cabinetry or furniture, although some concepts overlap. In British English joinery is distinguished from carpentry, which is considered to be a form of structural timber work; in other locales joinery is considered a form of carpentry.

==History==

Many traditional wood joinery techniques use the distinctive material properties of wood, often without resorting to mechanical fasteners or adhesives. While every culture of woodworking has a joinery tradition, wood joinery techniques have been especially well-documented, and are celebrated, in the Indian, Chinese, European, and Japanese traditions. Because of the physical existence of Indian and Egyptian examples, we know that furniture from the first several dynasties show the use of complex joints, like the Dovetail, over 5,000 years ago. This tradition continued to other later Western styles. The 18th-century writer Diderot included over 90 detailed illustrations of wood joints for building structures alone, in his comprehensive encyclopedia published in 1765. While Western techniques focused on concealment of joinery, the Eastern societies, though later, did not attempt to &quot;hide&quot; their joints. The Japanese and Chinese traditions in particular required the use of hundreds of types of joints. The reason was that nails and glues used did not stand up well to the vastly fluctuating temperatures and humid weather conditions in most of Central and South-East Asia. As well, the highly resinous woods used in traditional Chinese furniture do not glue well, even if they are cleaned with solvents and attached using modern glues.

As the trade modernized new developments have evolved to help speed, simplify, or improve joinery. Alongside the integration of different glue formulations, newer mechanical joinery techniques include &quot;biscuit&quot; and &quot;domino&quot; joints, and pocket screw joinery.

==Properties of wood==
Many wood joinery techniques either depend upon or compensate for the fact that wood is anisotropic: its material properties are different along different dimensions.

This must be taken into account when joining wood parts together, otherwise the joint is destined to fail. Gluing boards with the grain running perpendicular to each other is often the reason for split boards, or broken joints. Some furniture from the 18th century, while made by master craftsmen, did not take this into account. The result is a masterful work that may suffer from broken bracket feet, which was often attached with a glued block, which ran perpendicular to the base pieces. The glue blocks were fastened with both glue and nails, resulting in unequal expansion and contraction between the pieces. This was also the cause of splitting of wide boards, which were commonly available and used during that period.

In modern woodworking it is even more critical, as heating and air conditioning causes more severe respiration demands between the environment and the wood&#x27;s interior fibers. All woodworking joints must take these changes into account, and allow for the resulting movement. Each wood species has a general respiration rate; a generally-assumed time length for acclimating a board to its locale is 1 year per inch of thickness. In preparing raw wood for eventual usage as furniture or structures, one must account for uneven respiration and changes in the wood&#x27;s dimensions, as well as cracking or checking.

===Strength===
Wood is stronger when stressed along the grain (longitudinally) than it is when stressed across the grain (radially and tangentially). Wood is a natural composite material; parallel strands of cellulose fibers are held together by a lignin binder. These long chains of fibers make the wood exceptionally strong by resisting stress and spreading the load over the length of the board. Furthermore, cellulose is tougher than lignin, a fact demonstrated by the relative ease with which wood can be split along the grain compared to across it.

Different species of wood have different strength levels, and the exact strength may vary from sample to sample. Species also may differ on their length, density and parallelism of their cellulose strands.

===Dimensional stability===
Timber expands and contracts in response to humidity, usually much less so longitudinally than in the radial and tangential directions. As tracheophytes, trees have lignified tissues which transport resources such as water, minerals and photosynthetic products up and down the plant. While lumber from a harvested tree is no longer alive, these tissues still absorb and expel water causing swelling and shrinkage of the wood in kind with change in humidity. When the dimensional stability of the wood is paramount, quarter-sawn or rift-sawn lumber is preferred because its grain pattern is consistent and thus reacts less to humidity.

==Materials used for joining==

* Dowels can secure wood joints hold without the use of glue or mechanical fasteners, as in a pinned mortise and tenon.
* Glue is highly effective for joining timber when both surfaces of the joint are edge grain. A properly glued joint may be as strong or stronger than a single piece of wood. Animal glue is soluble in water, producing joints that can be disassembled using steam to soften the bond.
* Various mechanical fasteners may be used, the simplest being nails and screws. Glue and fasteners can be used together.

=== Reinforcing joints ===

* Dowel: A small rod is used internal to a joint both to help align and to strengthen the joint. Traditional joints such as butt joints are used with natural timbers as they do not need materials other than the timber itself. Dowel joints are also useful for pegging together weaker, cheaper composite materials such as laminate-faced chipboard, and where limited woodworking tools are available (since only simple drilled holes are needed to take the dowels). The wood species of a dowel may be different from the overall piece to balance strength with cost, and some joinery may leave a dowel end visible as part of the piece&#x27;s design.

* Biscuit joints: A small preformed wooden &#x27;biscuit&#x27; is inserted in a pre-cut slot to help align an edge or butt joint when gluing. 
* Domino joiner: A trademarked form of biscuit joiner, using a piece of preformed wood, larger than a traditional biscuit and referred to as a &quot;domino&quot;; has some of the advantages of dowels and of biscuits.

All reinforcements using wood as the introduced spanning material make use of the item&#x27;s cellulose fibers to resist breakage. Biscuits or dominos may provide only slight strength improvement while still forming a strong alignment guide for the joint&#x27;s pieces.

== Types of wood joints ==
=== Traditional ===
Most-commonly referenced joints carried forward from historical Western traditions.
=== Modern ===
==Joinery terms==
When material is removed to create a woodworking joint, the resulting surfaces have the following names:
* Cheek, the flat surface parallel to the face of the joint member which exposes long grain
* Shoulder, the surface perpendicular to the face or edge of the joint member which exposes end grain

==Joinery as a profession==
A joiner is an artisan and tradesperson who builds things by joining pieces of wood, particularly lighter and more ornamental work than that done by a carpenter, including furniture and the &quot;fittings&quot; of a house, ship, etc. Joiners may work in a workshop, because the formation of various joints is made easier by the use of non-portable, powered machinery, or on job site. A joiner usually produces items such as interior and exterior doors, windows, stairs, tables, bookshelves, cabinets, furniture, etc. In shipbuilding a &quot;marine joiner&quot; may work with materials other than wood such as linoleum, fibreglass, hardware, and gaskets.

The terms &quot;joinery&quot; and &quot;joiner&quot; are in common use in Canada, UK, Australia, and New Zealand. The term is not in common use in America, although the main trade union for American carpenters is called the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America.

In the UK, an apprentice of wood occupations could choose to study &quot;bench joinery&quot; or &quot;site carpentry and joinery.&quot; Bench joinery is the preparation, setting out, and manufacture of joinery components while site carpentry and joinery focus on the installation of the joinery components, and on the setting out and fabrication of timber elements used in construction.

In Canada, joinery is considered a separate trade from carpentry. Both having their own apprenticeship path and red-seal certification.

===History of joinery===
In the history of technology in Europe, joinery was the medieval development of frame and panel construction, as a means of coping with timber&#x27;s movement owing to moisture changes. Framed panel construction was utilised in furniture making. The development of joinery gave rise to &quot;joyners&quot;, a group of woodworkers distinct from the carpenters and arkwrights (arks were an intermediate stage between a carpenter&#x27;s boarded chest and a framed chest).

The original sense of joinery is only distantly related to the modern practice of woodworking joints, which are the work of carpenters. This new technique developed over several centuries and joiners started making more complex furniture and panelled rooms. Cabinetmaking became its own distinct furniture-making trade too, so joiners (under that name) became more associated with the room panelling trade.

By the height of craft woodworking (late 18th century), carpenters, joiners, and cabinetmakers were all distinct and would serve different apprenticeships.

In British English, a joiner is colloquially known as a &quot;chippy&quot;.

===Woodworking professions===

The Institute of Carpenters recognizes the following professionals working in wood:
*Carpenters
* Furniture and cabinet makers
*Boat builders (woodworking skills)
* Joiners
*Shopfitter
* Structural post and beam carpenters (timber framing)
* Wheelwrights
* Wood carvers
* Wood turners

<doc id="113268" wikidata="Q174945" url="?curid=113268" title="Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty">
<text>An Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB; , AHNE) is one of 46 areas of countryside in England, Wales, or Northern Ireland that has been designated for conservation due to its significant landscape value. Since 2023, the areas in England and Wales have also adopted the name National Landscapes ().

Areas are designated in recognition of their national importance by the relevant public body: Natural England, Natural Resources Wales, and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency respectively. On 22 November 2023, following a 2022 Landscapes Review policy paper, the AONBs in England and Wales adopted the National Landscapes name, and are in the process of rebranding. The name &quot;area of outstanding natural beauty&quot; is still the designated legal term.

In place of the term AONB, Scotland uses the similar national scenic area (NSA) designation. Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty enjoy levels of protection from development similar to those of UK national parks, but unlike national parks the responsible bodies do not have their own planning powers. They also differ from national parks in their more limited opportunities for extensive outdoor recreation.

==History==
The idea for what would eventually become the AONB designation was first put forward by John Dower in his 1945 &quot;Report to the Government on National Parks in England and Wales&quot;. Dower suggested there was need for protection of certain naturally beautiful landscapes that were unsuitable as national parks owing to their small size and lack of wildness. Dower&#x27;s recommendation for the designation of these &quot;other amenity areas&quot; was eventually embodied in the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 as the AONB designation.

==Purpose==
The purpose of an AONB designation is to conserve and enhance the natural beauty of the designated landscape.

There are two secondary aims: meeting the need for quiet enjoyment of the countryside and having regard for the interests of those who live and work there. To achieve these aims, AONBs rely on planning controls and practical countryside management. As they have the same landscape quality, AONBs may be compared to the national parks of England and Wales. National parks are well known in the UK; by contrast, there is evidence to indicate many residents in AONBs may be unaware of the status. However, the National Association of AONBs is working to increase awareness of AONBs in local communities, and, in 2014, successfully negotiated to have the boundaries of AONBs in England shown on Google Maps.

==Statistical overview==

There are 46 Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty in the United Kingdom: 33 in England, four in Wales, one on the England–Wales border, and eight in Northern Ireland. The first AONB was established in 1956 on the Gower Peninsula in South Wales, and the most recent to be designated is the Tamar Valley AONB, established in 1995. More recent changes include the Clwydian Range AONB being extended in 2012 to form the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley AONB, and the Strangford Lough and Lecale Coast AONBs being merged to form a single AONB in 2010.

AONBs vary greatly in terms of size, type and use of land, and whether they are partly or wholly open to the public. The smallest AONB is the Isles of Scilly, , and the largest is the Cotswolds, . AONBs cover around 15% of England and 4% of Wales.

==Legal status and organisation==
AONBs in England and Wales were originally created under the same legislation as the national parks, the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. Unlike AONBs, national parks have special legal powers to prevent unsympathetic development. AONBs in general remain the responsibility of their local authorities by means of special committees that include members appointed by a minister and by parishes, and only very limited statutory duties were imposed on local authorities within an AONB by the original 1949 Act. However, further regulation and protection of AONBs in England and Wales was added by the Countryside and Rights of Way (CRoW) Act 2000, under which new designations are now made,

In the National Planning Policy Framework (March 2012), the government stated that AONBs and national parks have equal status when it comes to planning decisions on landscape issues. Two of the AONBs (the Cotswolds and the Chilterns), which extend into a large number of local authority areas, have their own statutory bodies, known as conservation boards. In 2019 the Glover Report made various recommendations regarding the future of AONBsthe report&#x27;s &#x27;central proposal&#x27; being to bring National Parks and AONBs together as part of one &#x27;family of national landscapes&#x27;but as at 1 November 2020 the government has yet to respond to those recommendations. However, the Cotswolds Conservation Board announced in September 2020 that they were re-styling the area name and it is now known as the Cotswolds National Landscape.

All English and Welsh AONBs have a dedicated AONB officer and other staff. As required by the CRoW Act, each AONB has a management plan that sets out the characteristics and special qualities of the landscape and how they will be conserved and enhanced. The AONBs are collectively represented by the National Association for Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (NAAONB), an independent registered charity acting on behalf of AONBs and their partners, which uses the slogan &quot;Landscapes for Life&quot;.

AONBs in Northern Ireland was designated originally under the Amenity Lands (NI) Act 1965; subsequently under the Nature Conservation and Amenity Lands (NI) Order 1985.

==Threats==

There are growing concerns among environmental and countryside groups that AONB status is increasingly under threat from development. The Campaign to Protect Rural England said in July 2006 that many AONBs were under greater threat than ever before. Three particular AONBs were cited: the Dorset AONB threatened by a road plan, the threat of a football stadium in the Sussex Downs AONB, and, larger than any other, a £1 billion plan by Imperial College London to build thousands of houses and offices on hundreds of acres of AONB land on the Kent Downs at Wye. In September 2007 government approval was finally given for the development of a new football ground for Brighton and Hove Albion within the boundaries of the Sussex Downs AONB, after a fierce fight by conservationists. The subsequent development, known as Falmer Stadium, was officially opened in July 2011. The Weymouth Relief Road in Dorset was constructed between 2008 and 2011, after environmental groups lost a High Court challenge to prevent its construction.

Writing in 2006, Professor Adrian Phillips listed threats facing AONBs, which he says include uncertainty over future support for land management, increasing development pressures, the impacts of globalization, and climate change. More subtle threats include creeping suburbanization and horsiculture.

==Celebration==
Poet Laureate Simon Armitage wrote a poem &quot;Fugitives&quot;, commissioned by the National Association of AONBs, which he read on Arnside Knott on 21 September 2019 to launch the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act.

==List of Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty==

====Former Areas====
South Hampshire Coast AONB

The establishment of the New Forest National Park in 2005 meant the subsumption of South Hampshire Coast AONB into it.

East Hampshire AONB and Sussex Downs AONB

East Hampshire and Sussex Downs AONBs were replaced in 2010 by the South Downs National Park.

Notes
===Proposed areas in England===

The following are formal proposals for new AONBs submitted to Natural England:
*Cambs Ouse Valley
*Churnet Valley
*Forest of Dean
*Herefordshire Marches
*Northants Ironstone Uplands
*Yorkshire Wolds

The 2019 Landscape Review Report additionally favourably mentions proposals not listed in Natural England&#x27;s list: from Sandstone Ridge and the Vale of Belvoir. The Cheshire Sandstone Ridge was subsequently shortlisted for AONB designation in 2021.

On 8 October 2024, Natural England launched a statutory and public consultation for proposed plans to designate part of the Yorkshire Wolds as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

<text>In woodworking and carpentry, hand saws, also known as &quot;panel saws&quot;, are used to cut pieces of wood into different shapes. This is usually done in order to join the pieces together and carve a wooden object. They operate by having a series of sharp points, called teeth, of a substance that is harder than the wood being cut.

Hand saws have been used for thousands of years. Egyptian hieroglyphics exist depicting ancient woodworkers sawing boards into pieces, and ancient bow saws have been found in Japan. Cut patterns on ancient boards are occasionally observed to bear the unique cutting marks left by saw blades, particularly if the wood was not &#x27;smoothed up&#x27; by some method. Twenty-four saws from eighteenth-century England are currently preserved.

Materials for saw blades have varied over the ages. Bronze saws were likely used before steelmaking technology became extensively known and industrialized.

The most popular material for handles of hand saws is applewood; in the early 1900s 2,000,000 board feet of applewood were used annually for this purpose.

Sometimes cultures developed two main types of saw teeth: the cross cut saw teeth and the rip saw teeth. These cut into the wood using different mechanisms. Crosscut saws have sawteeth that are shaped, often with a metal file, in such a way that they form a series of tiny knife-like edges. Crosscut saws are meant to cut perpendicular, or against, the wood grain. Rip saws, on the other hand, have chisel-like sawteeth and are meant to cut parallel, or with, the grain. Wood fibers are contacted by the teeth and &#x27;ripped&#x27; apart from the bundle of other fibers. It is common that people do not recognize the difference and use saws both ways. However, a rip saw is much faster than a cross-cut saw when cutting with the grain but leaves a very rough cut, often with splinters on the surface, and has more difficulty maintaining a straight cut when cutting across the grain. The cross-cut saw can cut in any direction but is much slower than needs be when cutting with the grain.

The development of saws was also affected by several factors. The first was the importance of wood to a society, the development of steel and other saw-making technologies, and the type of power available. These factors were, in turn, influenced by the environment, such as the types of wood or metal available. Finally, the types of jobs the saws were to perform was also important in the development of the technology.

Among Basques and Australians, traditional hand sawing has generated rural sports. The Basque variant is called tronral.

<text>An adze () or adz is an ancient and versatile cutting tool similar to an axe but with the cutting edge perpendicular to the handle rather than parallel. Adzes have been used since the Stone Age. They are used for smoothing or carving wood in hand woodworking, and as a hoe for agriculture and horticulture. Two basic forms of an adze are the hand adze (short hoe)—a short-handled tool swung with one hand—and the foot adze (hoe)—a long-handled tool capable of powerful swings using both hands, the cutting edge usually striking at foot or shin level. A similar tool is called a mattock, which differs by having two blades, one perpendicular to the handle and one parallel.

== History ==
=== Africa ===
The adze is depicted in ancient Egyptian art from the Old Kingdom onward. Originally the adze blades were made of stone, but already in the Predynastic Period copper adzes had all but replaced those made of flint. Stone blades were fastened to the handle by tying and early bronze blades continued this simple construction. It was not until the later Bronze Age that the handle passes through an eye at the top of the blade. Examples of Egyptian adzes can be found in museums and on the Petrie Museum website.
A depiction of an adze was also used as a hieroglyph, representing the consonants &quot;stp&quot;, &quot;chosen&quot;, and used as: &quot;...Pharaoh XX, chosen of God/Goddess YY...&quot;

The &quot;ahnetjer&quot; (Manuel de Codage transliteration: &quot;aH-nTr&quot;) depicted as an adze-like instrument, was used in the Opening of the Mouth ceremony, intended to convey power over their senses to statues and mummies. It was apparently the foreleg of a freshly sacrificed bull or cow with which the mouth was touched.

As Iron Age technology moved south into Africa with migrating ancient Egyptians, they carried their technology with them, including adzes. To this day, iron adzes are used all over rural Africa for various purposes—from digging pit latrines, and chopping firewood, to tilling crop fields—whether they are of maize (corn), coffee, tea, pyrethrum, beans, millet, yams, or a plethora of other cash and subsistence crops.

=== New Zealand ===
Prehistoric Māori adzes from New Zealand were for wood carving, typically made from pounamu sourced from the South Island. During the Māori Archaic period found on the North Island were commonly made from greywacke from Motutapu Island or basalt from Opito Bay in the Coromandel, similar to adzes constructed on other Pacific Islands. Early period notched adzes found in Northland were primarily made of argillite quarried from locations around the Marlborough and Nelson regions. At the same time on Henderson Island, a small coral island in eastern Polynesia lacking any rock other than limestone, native populations may have fashioned giant clamshells into adzes.

=== Northwest Coastal America ===

American Northwest coast native peoples traditionally used adzes for both functional construction (from bowls to canoes) and art (from masks to totem poles). Northwest coast adzes take two forms: hafted and D-handle. The hafted form is similar in form to a European adze with the haft constructed from a natural crooked branch which approximately forms a 60% angle. The thin end is used as the handle and the thick end is flattened and notched such that an adze iron can be lashed to it. Modern hafts are sometimes constructed from a sawed blank with a dowel added for strength at the crook. The second form is the D-handle adze which is basically an adze iron with a directly attached handle. The D-handle, therefore, provides no mechanical leverage. Northwest coast adzes are often classified by size and iron shape vs. role. As with European adzes, iron shapes include straight, gutter and lipped. Where larger Northwest adzes are similar in size to their European counterparts, the smaller sizes are typically much lighter such that they can be used for the detailed smoothing, shaping and surface texturing required for figure carving. Final surfacing is sometimes performed with a crooked knife.

===New Guinea and Melanesia ===

Ground stone adzes used to be produced by a variety of people in Western New Guinea (Indonesia), Papua New Guinea and some of the smaller Islands of Melanesia and Micronesia. The hardstone would have been ground on a riverine rock with the help of water until the desired shape was obtained. It was then fixed to a natural grown angled wood with resin and plant fibers. A variety of minerals were used. Imported steel axes or machetes have now entirely replaced these tools for decades in even the remotest parts of New Guinea. Indeed, even before the first foreign missionaries or colonial officials arrived in the New Guinea Highlands, inhabitants had already obtained steel tools through trade with their neighbors. Stone tools are sometimes manufactured to be sold as curios to tourists.

== Modern adzes ==
Modern adzes are made from steel with wooden handles, and enjoy limited use: occasionally in semi-industrial areas, but particularly by &quot;revivalists&quot; such as those at the Colonial Williamsburg cultural center in Virginia, United States. However, the traditional adze has largely been replaced by the sawmill and the powered plane, at least in industrialised cultures. It remains in use for some specialist crafts, for example by coopers. Adzes are also in current use by artists such as Northwest Coast American and Canadian Indigenous sculptors doing totem pole carving, as well as masks and bowls.

===Foot adze===
&quot;Adzes are used for removing heavy waste, leveling, shaping, or trimming the surfaces of timber&quot; and boards. Generally, the user stands astride a board or log and swings the adze downwards between his feet, chipping off pieces of wood, moving backwards as they go and leaving a relatively smooth surface behind.

Foot adzes are most commonly known as shipbuilder&#x27;s or carpenter&#x27;s adzes. They range in size from 00 to 5 being with the cutting edge wide. On the modern, steel adze the cutting edge may be flat for smoothing work to very rounded for hollowing work such as bowls, gutters and canoes. The shoulders or sides of an adze may be curved called a &quot;lipped adze&quot;, used for notching. The end away from the cutting edge is called the pole and be of different shapes, generally flat or a &quot;pin pole&quot;.

* Carpenter&#x27;s adze A heavy adze, often with very steep curves, and a very heavy, blunt pole. The weight of this adze makes it unsuitable for sustained overhead adzing.
** Railroad adze A carpenter&#x27;s adze which had its bit extended in an effort to limit the breaking of handles when shaping railroad ties (railway sleepers). Early examples in New England began showing up approximately in the 1840s–1850s. The initial prototypes clearly showed a weld where the extension was attached.
* Shipwright&#x27;s adze A lighter, and more versatile adze than the carpenter&#x27;s adze. This was designed to be used in a variety of positions, including overhead, as well as in front on waist and chest level.
** Lipped shipwright&#x27;s adze A variation of the shipwright&#x27;s adze. It features a wider than normal bit, whose outside edges are sharply turned up, so that when gazing directly down the adze, from bit to eye, the cutting edge resembles an extremely wide and often very flat U. This adze was mainly used for shaping cross grain, such as for joining planks.
* Another group of adzes can be differentiated by the handles; the D-handled adzes have a handle where the hand can be wrapped around the D, close to the bit. These adzes closely follow traditional forms in that the bit or tooth is not wrapped around the handle as a head.
* The head of an ice axe typically possesses an adze for chopping rough steps in ice.
* A firefighter tool called the Halligan bar has a dull adze on one end of the bar. This bar is a multipurpose tool for forcible entry of a structure and demolition with a forked pry-bar on one end and an adze and spike on the other, called the adze-end.
*Demolition adze A demolition adze has a dull edge and is used for separating materials in the demolition or salvage of old buildings.

===Hand adze===

There are a number of specialist, short-handled adzes used by coopers, wainwrights, and chair makers, and in bowl and trough making. Many of these have shorter handles for control and more curve in the head to allow better clearance for shorter cuts.

=== Bulgarian adze ===
During the communist period of Bulgaria, a new multi-use woodworking adze, called (), emerged. It has a sharpened edge perpendicular to the handle, resembling an adze, but it is also used like a carpenter&#x27;s hammer. On the back of the head is a textured poll for driving nails, and on the front is a V-shaped hole used for prying, to extract the bent nails. 

Some urban legends say that Bulgarian migrant workers always carry their adzes with them so they can do construction work more efficiently due to the lack of Western equivalent of the tool. The Bulgarian adze is often mistaken for a hammer.

There is a popular Bulgarian folk song called &quot;На теслата дръжката&quot; (eng: The tesla&#x27;s handle) about a craftsman and the masculinity of his tool.

<doc id="113277" wikidata="Q110127709" url="?curid=113277" title="Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty in Wales">
<text>There are five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) in Wales, known from November 2023 as &quot;National Landscapes&quot; (). AONBs are areas of countryside that have been designated for statutory protection, due to their significant landscape value, by initially the Government of the United Kingdom and later Welsh devolved bodies. Of the current five areas designated, four are wholly in Wales, with another spanning the Wales-England border, and in total AONBs account for 4% of Wales&#x27; land area.

The responsibility of designating areas in recognition of their national importance is devolved to Wales and performed by Natural Resources Wales (formerly the Countryside Council for Wales), on behalf of the Welsh Government. The designation is also used in England, and Northern Ireland. Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty enjoy levels of protection from development similar to those of Welsh national parks, but unlike national parks, the responsible AONB bodies do not have their own planning powers, instead are performed by local authorities. They also differ from national parks in their more limited opportunities for extensive outdoor recreation. The Welsh Government had proposed that the designation be renamed to &quot;National Landscapes of Wales&quot;, however, they did not follow through with the proposals. In November 2023, all AONBs across England and Wales were to be renamed &quot;National Landscapes&quot;.

Of the five, the Gower AONB was the first area to be designated in Wales in 1956, and the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley AONB is the most recent, designated as the Clwydian Range AONB in 1985, and expanded to the Dee Valley in 2011.

==History==

The Hobhouse Report by Sir Arthur Hobhouse, published in July 1947 to the Ministry of Town and Country Planning, proposed 52 conservation areas in England and Wales, of which under the term &quot;Western&quot;, eleven are wholly in Wales, and a further three are situated around the Wales-England border. These areas were selected for their &quot;outstanding landscape beauty&quot; and home to &quot;great scientific interest&quot;, which was deemed worthy of protection and management through statutory designation. The Hobhouse Report alongside the 1945 &quot;Report to the Government on National Parks in England and Wales&quot; by John Gordon Dower, would contribute to the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 which created the National Parks and set up the designation later to become &quot;Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty&quot;.

Conservation areas proposed in the 1947 Hobhouse Report; with their proposed size; likely to be wholly in Wales:

Conservation areas proposed in the 1947 Hobhouse Report; with their proposed size; but extent into Wales unknown, may be only in England or extend into Wales:

* &quot;May be wholly in Wales or extend further through the Clun Forest into England.&quot;

===Designation of the AONBs===
AONBs were first designated under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, and prior to devolution, were designated on behalf of the UK Government.

The first AONB to be designated with the status in Wales was the Gower AONB in 1956, designated for its classic limestone coast and local natural habitats, it was also the first AONB designated in the UK. This was followed by parts of the Llŷn Peninsula to be designated an AONB in 1957, with of the AONB&#x27;s coastline also designated as a Heritage coast. The coasts of Anglesey were designated as an AONB in 1966, with its status confirmed the following year, the status was awarded to the Anglesey Coast to protect its aesthetic appeal and the various landscapes and habitats from inappropriate development. The Wye Valley, spanning parts of both Wales and England, was designated in 1971, to protect the AONBs various features including: limestone gorges, native woodlands, hillforts, castles and the first Cistercian Abbey in Wales. The Clwydian Range was designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in 1985 by the Secretary of State for Wales Nicholas Edwards MP; with proposals to extend it to the Dee Valley by the Countryside Council for Wales and local councils announced in 2010, and approved in November 2011 expanding the AONB to become the current Clwydian Range and Dee Valley.

===2015 review===
In 2014, Carl Sargeant AM, then Minister for Natural Resources, commissioned for a Review of the Designated Landscapes in Wales, to &quot;ensure that [Wales&#x27;] designated landscapes are best equipped to meet current and future challenges while building upon their internationally recognised status&quot;.

In July 2015, the Welsh Government commissioned review paper, produced by an independent panel chaired by Professor Terry Marsden of Cardiff University (&quot;Marsden review&quot;) was published, providing 69 recommendations

The initial report called for grouping the AONBs with National Parks as &quot;The National Designated Landscapes of Wales&quot;, but opposed any plans to make AONBs and National Parks a single designation, and instead, both designations are &quot;the equivalent designations&quot; with identical Statutory Purposes and Duties, with a further initial recommendation for renaming AONBs to &quot;National Landscapes&quot;.

The review detailed three &quot;statutory purposes&quot;:

* Conservation — &quot;To conserve and enhance the distinctive landscape and seascape qualities of the area&quot;
* Human Well-being — &quot;To promote physical and mental well-being through the enjoyment and understanding of the landscape of the area&quot; 
* Sustainable Resource Management — &quot;To promote sustainable forms of natural resource management and economic and community development which support the cultural heritage of the area.&quot;

and recommended a reclarified Statutory Duty, replacing the current &quot;have regard to&quot; duty in existing public bodies, to be replaced with a &quot;single and clear duty&quot; — &quot;To contribute to the delivery of the three Purposes of the National Designated Landscapes&quot;. The Sandford Principle was also recommended to be retained in the review, which confirms the primacy of conservation in the AONBs should conflict with other duties arise.

It also proposed that AONBs should become statutory consultees on planning applications that are considered to have an impact on the &quot;special qualities&quot; of the AONBs. The authors of the report recommended that the management bodies of the AONBs and national parks should maintain their purposes, in conserving the landscape, promoting physical well-being, and promoting sustainable economic and community development. But the report states that the bodies have to improve their understanding of the local economy, in particular the tourism sector.

Lesley Griffiths AM, then Cabinet Secretary for Environment and Rural Affairs, would describe the crux of the report to be the promotion of the authorities&#x27; duty to consider the socio-economic well-being of the AONBs.

The Marsden review also recommended that the Welsh Government empower AONBs and national parks to become centres of innovation and a catalyst for development for regions of rural Wales, but within the designated landscapes&#x27; &quot;environmental limits&quot;, and to set performance targets for the managing bodies of the designated landscapes.

Other recommendations in the report include: extending AONB boundaries to cover adjacent sea areas, reducing the regulatory burden of audit, creation of bodies (including a National Landscape Committee, National Partnership Board and Local Partnerships), the introduction of a Partnership Plan for each area, remove the political balance requirement on AONB boards (revised to have local authority, national and “local” appointees allocated proportionally), and finally provide a core grant from Welsh Government for all designated landscape areas (whilst increasing scrutiny and diversity of their overall revenue budget through pan-Wales strategy using indicators and targets).

A final report of the Review of Designated Landscapes in Wales was published in November 2015. The report&#x27;s new recommendations include; no change of name (as mentioned below) or legal status of AONBs or national parks in Wales, strengthening the supporting and delivery role of other bodies, and creating a National Landscape Committee.

In March 2018, Hannah Blythyn AM, then Minister for Environment, stated no changes were to be made on how AONBs operate in Wales, including the proposed name change.

====Proposed renaming====
The initial Marsden review proposed that Wales&#x27; five AONBs be renamed to the &quot;National Landscapes of Wales&quot;.

The proposals met criticism from AMs, MPs, volunteer groups, and tourist trade organisations, with South Wales West AM Peter Black describing the move to be &quot;misguided&quot; and &quot;should be ignored&quot;. Black also questioned how redesignating would work on the Wye Valley AONB, shared with England where renaming may not be applied. With opposition from Gower (home to Wales&#x27; first AONB) being increasingly vocal in their opposition. Critics describe the re-branding to be a potential turn off for tourism to the areas, and describe the AONB naming to have years of brand integrity. A Welsh Government spokesperson said that any renaming of the areas would be subject to a full public consultation. Supporters of renaming describe the term &quot;AONB&quot; to be &quot;unusual&quot; due to it being overly descriptive and emotive. Other supporters support the rename to include &quot;Wales&quot; in the title to provide some distinction to Wales&#x27; areas over AONBs remaining in England and Northern Ireland. The renaming was also proposed for AONBs elsewhere in the United Kingdom, and followed through by the Cotswolds AONB which rebranded itself to the Cotswolds National Landscape in 2020. In November 2023, all AONBs across England and Wales were to be renamed &quot;National Landscapes&quot;.

A later published finalised review by Marsden removed the recommendation for renaming AONBs, recommending instead that &quot;The Welsh Government should retain the names of &quot;National Parks&quot; and &quot;Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty&quot; (AONBs) as the key designations of the &quot;National Landscapes of Wales&quot;&quot;. With the existing designations being within a consistent and resilient nomenclature, coined in the report to potentially be &quot;The National Landscapes of Wales&quot;, reaffirming as initially recommended, that both AONBs and National Parks be &quot;The Equivalent Designations&quot; within this one group. 

===2017 review===
In 2015, Carl Sargeant AM, then Minister for Natural Resources, set up a Future Landscape Working Group, chaired by Dafydd Elis-Thomas AM for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, and aimed to explore the recommendations from the Marsden review and report findings in 2016. The group included representatives from the AONBs, National Parks, various environmental groups, and business and government officials.

The &quot;Future Landscapes&quot; review was published in May 2017. It set out a new plan for AONBs and National Parks, advocating that they should go beyond their current duties for improving conservation and amenities, by becoming &quot;drivers&quot; of sustainable natural resource management (as set out in Welsh legislation), provide a benefit for the wider public and private within and beyond their designated areas, realising the economic potential of local communities, promote green growth and ecosystem resilience. For governance of the areas, the review recommended that bodies and partnerships of the AONBs work across their boundaries together with Natural Resources Wales and local partnerships to promote the social, cultural, and economic value of the areas, and improve sustainable usage of the areas. Following publication, Lesley Griffiths, then Cabinet Secretary for Environment and Rural Affairs, thanked the group for their work, and stated that &quot;the next step is to deliver against the ambition, not in isolation, but together as part of the collaborative approach&quot;.

Critics of the report state that, it fails to mention the &quot;Sandford Principle&quot; which was a key recommendation in the Marsden review. The principle means that whenever there is a conflict between recreation in designated landscapes and the authorities&#x27; duty for the conservation of the area, conservation takes priority over recreation. Some AMs have voiced their fears that the report can lead to legislation that removes the extra protections awarded to designated landscapes, and could allow developments, in particular, focused on green infrastructure such as wind farms, to be built within the protected areas. Which critics describe would &quot;detract from the purpose&quot; of the areas&#x27; designated status. The Snowdonia Society, stated the report lacked clarity and echoed the concerns that the report lacked an emphasis on the primacy of conservation, noting that the word &quot;Conservation&quot; was absent in the Future Landscapes document.

In 2017, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) World Commission on Protected Areas&#x27; UK Assessment Panel, expressed concerns over the &quot;Future Landscapes&quot; report commissioned by the Welsh Government. The panel stated that the new report diluted the importance of conservation in the designated landscapes as recommended in the Marsden review, and stylises the landscapes as &quot;catalysts for regional development in rural areas&quot;, rather than from an environmental point of view. The panel concluded, that if the report&#x27;s recommendations are acted upon, it would be &quot;impossible for the panel to continue to accord international recognition to Wales’s national parks and AONBs as protected areas&quot;, and that Wales&#x27; National Parks and AONBs would be less protected and weaker than those designated in the rest of the United Kingdom.

In March 2018, Minister for Environment Hannah Blythyn AM stated no changes were to be made on how AONBs operate in Wales.

=== Re-naming ===
On 22 November 2023, it was announced all AONBs in England and Wales would be renamed to &quot;National Landscapes&quot;.

==Management==
Powers for the designation and management of AONBs are devolved to Wales, under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CRoW Act). Under Section 82 of the CRoW Act, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) holds the right to designate any area of Wales, that is deemed to be of &quot;outstanding natural beauty&quot; worthy of conservation and enhancement that is not within a National Park, to be an AONB, following approval from the Welsh Government. NRW advises the government on any areas it deems suitable for AONB status, awards partnership funding to AONBs, and advises planning and development that may have an impact on the AONB.

Each AONB has a dedicated AONB officer, other staff, and alongside other AONBs in the United Kingdom are collectively represented by the &quot;National Association for Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty&quot; (NAAONB).

AONBs are classified as a Category V landscape by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

Natural Resources Wales (NRW) has overall responsibility for AONBs nationally in Wales but the AONBs are locally managed by local authorities with the support of Joint Advisory Committees (JAC), local communities and partnerships.

Under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, local authorities are responsible for developing an AONB management plan. This plan is constructed in consultation with the advisory committees and an AONB partnershipwhich reports and advises the local authoritiesin the development and completion of the AONB Management Plan. The management plan sets out the policies the local authorities want to enact for the management of the AONB and how these policies would be implemented and achieved, providing a framework of permitted activities in the AONB. The management plan is required to take into consideration various issues of the AONB and not be limited to only environmental priorities, but also to analyse and address social and economic issues in the AONB. The 2000 act mandates that management plans have to be revised no less than every five years, with Natural Resources Wales (formed from a merger including the Countryside Council for Wales in 2013) providing funding for AONB management to the local authorities, allocated based on the AONB&#x27;s management plan&#x27;s policies. Local authorities or joint committees are required to notify NRW when they are intending to publish their management plan. The same act places a duty on public bodies; including private utility companies to respect efforts made to conserve, protect, and enhance the AONB&#x27;s natural beauty.

The AONB designation shares the same status in terms of planning with national parks, however, unlike national parks, AONB&#x27;s cannot undertake their own planning operations. Instead, the powers are awarded to the relevant planning authorities of the local unitary authorities on behalf of the AONB.

The National Association of AONBs as part of their efforts to increase awareness of AONBs in local communities, successfully negotiated in 2014 to have the boundaries of AONBs in England shown on Google Maps. The Welsh Government, as of 2021, has not released data of AONB boundaries to be used by Google on Google Maps.

==List of areas==

Five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) have been designated in Wales, one of which, the Wye Valley AONB, straddles the Anglo-Welsh border. The areas are:

*Gower AONB () – which spans of the Gower peninsula. The AONB covers almost the entire peninsula (excluding some eastern urban areas), and is located within the City and County of Swansea on the south-west coast of Wales, on the north side of the Bristol Channel. Referred to colloquially as &#x27;the Gower&#x27;, it was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an AONB in 1956.
*Llŷn AONB () – which spans or around a quarter of the Llŷn Peninsula, covering much of the coastline and the ex-volcanic hills. The peninsula extends into the Irish Sea from mainland north-west Wales, and south-west of the Isle of Anglesey. The AONB was created in 1956, and is one of the most scientifically important in both Wales and the United Kingdom. of the AONB&#x27;s coastline is Heritage coast.
*Anglesey AONB () – which was designated as a AONB in 1966, in order to protect the aesthetic appeal and variety of the island&#x27;s coastal landscape and habitats from inappropriate development. The AONB covers most of Anglesey&#x27;s coastline, as well as inland areas, such as Holyhead Mountain and Mynydd Bodafon. The AONB covers around , about a third of the county, making it Wales&#x27; second-largest AONB, and largest until 2011.
*Wye Valley AONB () – which was designated in 1971, is an internationally important protected landscape straddling the border between England and Wales, with the Welsh section wholly within Monmouthshire. It is one of the most dramatic and scenic landscape areas in Southern Britain. The River Wye () is the fifth-longest river in the United Kingdom. The upper part of the river passes through the settlements of Rhayader, Builth Wells and Hay-on-Wye, but the area designated as an AONB surrounds only the 58-mile stretch lower down the river, from just south of the English city of Hereford to Chepstow in Wales.
*Clwydian Range and Dee Valley AONB () – is the largest AONB in Wales, located in the country&#x27;s north-east, in Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham. First designated in 1985 to cover only the Clwydian Range, a series of hills running from Prestatyn to Llandegla. The AONB was expanded to areas around the River Dee and Vale of Llangollen in 2011, including the Eglwyseg escarpment and Llantysilio Mountain. The highest point in the AONB is Moel Fferna in the Berwyns at , but the most popular summit, and prior to 2011 the highest peak, is Moel Famau in the Clwydian Range at . The AONB is in land area, increasing from before 2011, and it is also a proposed national park.

===Proposed areas===

* Cambrian Mountains — launched in November 2006, the campaign by Cambrian Mountains Society to make the area an AONB, campaign on the basis that AONB status would &quot;boost the local economy, and help agriculture, heritage and culture&quot;. The area&#x27;s bid to become a national park has been in the works since the 1960s, reaching the Welsh Office in 1973, where it was ultimately rejected. The campaign continues to propose that the area should become a national park, advocating for any type of environmental protection for the area. Welsh ministers expressed openness to the idea in 2023, however progress on the bid would be delayed to 2026 as ministers focus on a Clwydian Range and Dee Valley national park.
*Ceiriog Valley and Y Berwyn — The Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) started the consideration of the area into an AONB in February 2011 alongside proposals for the then Clwydian Range AONB. A final report published in March 2012, concluded that AONB status for Y Berwyn (which includes the Ceiriog Valley) is &quot;desirable for the statutory purpose of conserving and enhancing the area’s natural beauty&quot;, but further work is to be done by the CCW to investigate alternatives to AONB status before a final decision is to be made.
* Expansion of the Gower AONB — first proposed in 2005, the Gower Society calls for an extension of the Gower AONB, and submitted a proposal to the National Assembly for Wales in March 2012. The Gower Society have also proposed for the AONB to become a national park, however such proposals have not been acted on by the Welsh Assembly Government.
* Gwent Levels — In July 2019, John Griffiths AM for Newport East called for the area to be awarded AONB status following the scrapping of the proposed M4 relief road, which if followed through would&#x27;ve passed through the proposed area. Griffiths states that AONB status would protect the area from similar proposals. The Gwent branch of the Wales Green Party sponsored a petition to make the area an AONB.
* Towy Valley (Tywi Valley) – In April 2023, the Carmarthenshire Residents Action Group launched a campaign for the Towy Valley to become an AONB to protect the area from &quot;harmful developments&quot;, with proposed electricity pylons used as an example.
* &quot;Mid Wales&quot; – In April 2023, a petition was launched for a &quot;Mid Wales AONB&quot; covering the Upper Wye Valley and the water catchment areas of at least the rivers Irfon, Ithon and Elan.

===Rating===
In November 2021, a Which? review listed Gower as the top-rated AONB in Wales (10th in the UK); followed by Wye Valley (15th), Llŷn (20th), Clwydian Range and Dee Valley (21st), and Anglesey (26th).

<doc id="113279" wikidata="Q253379" url="?curid=113279" title="Broadaxe">
<text>A broadaxe is a large broad-headed axe. There are two categories of cutting edge on broadaxes, both are used for shaping logs into beams by hewing. On one type, one side is flat, and the other side beveled, a basilled edge, also called a side axe, single bevel, or chisle-edged axe. On the other type, both sides are beveled, sometimes called a double bevel axe, which produces a scalloped cut.

On the basilled broadaxe the handle may curve away from the flat side to allow an optimal stance by the hewer in relation to the hewn surface, and to allow clearance for the hewer&#x27;s hands. The flat blade is to make the surface flat but can only be worked from one direction and is right-handed or left-handed. The double bevel axe has a straight handle and can be swung with either side against the wood. A double-beveled broad axe can be used for chopping or notching as well as hewing. When used for hewing, notches are chopped in the side of the log down to a marked line, a process called scoring. The pieces of wood between these notches are removed with an axe, a process called joggling, and then the remaining wood is hewn to the line.

== History ==
Broad axes have been used since ancient times until the end of the 19th century in Europe and North America. Broadaxes were commonly used in manufacture of square timbers for wooden shipbuilding, log building, timber framing, and railroad ties sometimes called axe ties. Some broad axes are of a shape where part of the axe is called a beard so the axe is called a long-bearded axe.

== Modern uses ==
Since the introduction of sawmills and modern power tools, the use of this tool is now uncommon in manufacturing but still used in restoration carpentry or undeveloped regions.

<doc id="113282" wikidata="Q5748404" url="?curid=113282" title="Hewing">
<text>In woodworking, hewing is the process of converting a log from its rounded natural form into lumber (timber) with more or less flat surfaces using primarily an axe. It is an ancient method, and before the advent the sawmills, it was a standard way of squaring up wooden beams for timber framing. Today it is still used occasionally for that purpose by anyone who has logs, needs beams, and cannot or would prefer not to pay for finished lumber. Thus, homesteaders on frugal budgets, for example, may hew their own lumber rather than buy it.

==Definitions==
&quot;Hew&quot; is a general term meaning to strike or blow with a tool such as an axe or sword; to chop or gash, and is used in warfare, stone and woodcutting, and coal and salt mining in this sense. Hewing wood is to shape the wood with a sharp instrument such as an axe, specifically flattening one or more sides of a log.

==Methods==
As an ancient method of timber &quot;conversion&quot;, different methods of each step in hewing have developed in history.

===Prepare log===
After a tree is selected and felled, hewing can take place where the log landed or be skidded or twitched (skidded with a horse or oxen) out of the woods to a work site. The log is placed across two other smaller logs near the ground or up on trestles about waist height; stabilized either by notching the support logs, or using a &#x27;timber dog&#x27; (also called a log dog, a long bar of iron with a tooth on either end that jams into the logs and prevents movement). 
The hewer measures and locates the timber within the log on both ends and marks lines along the length of a log, usually with a chalk line.

===Scoring===
The next step is to chop notches every foot or two, almost as deep as the marked line using a chopping or scoring axe, called scoring. At least three methods are used in scoring. 1) Standing on the log and swinging an axe to chop the score; 2) In Germany a method of two carpenters standing on the ground with the log on trestles and swinging downward to slice the scores. (see video in link below); 3) A chainsaw is used to notch the log, the sections created by the notching are then split off using a felling axe.

===Joggling or juggling===
The pieces of wood between the notches are knocked off with an axe, this process called juggling or joggling. This results in a rough surface pared down just shy of the marked line. Scoring and juggling remove a fair amount of wood, make hewing easier and prevent long shreds of wood being torn off.

===Hewing===
Hewing is the last step in this whole process, which is also collectively referred to as hewing. Hewing is done on the logs sides with a broadaxe. Hewing occurs from the bottom of the stem upwards towards what was the top of the standing tree, reducing the tendency of the broken fibers to migrate inwards towards the eventual beam.

It is widely published that an adze was used to hew the top surface of a log flat in the same manner as an axe is used on the sides of a log. However, physical evidence of looking at the marks left by the hewing tools in historic buildings, called tracology, are swung in an arc and thus made by an axe, not an adze. Shipbuilders frequently used adzes in shaping ship timbers, the choice of tool being made by the position of the surface being hewn, the sides best hewn with an axe and the face best hewn with an adze. Historic illustrations do show some Asian carpenters hewing building timbers with an adze. Further smoothing can then be done using a hand plane, drawknife, yariganna (an ancient Japanese cutting tool) or any other established or improvised means.

Some 19th-century timber buildings in the U.S. have hewn long timbers in the same framing with vertically sawn and the later technology of circular sawn timbers. The reason for this is the long timbers were easier to hew with an axe than to take to a sawmill due to poor transportation routes.

Hewn railroad ties are known as axe ties and were made by a &quot;tiehacker&quot;.

===Modern uses===
Although still used in niche modern building, salvaged hand-hewn beams are now commonly recycled as architectural details popular in new construction and renovation of homes. They are also popular as decor in commercial and restaurant spaces.

<text>Novi Sad (, ; see below for other names) is the second largest city in Serbia after the capital Belgrade and the capital of the autonomous province of Vojvodina. It is located in the southern portion of the Pannonian Plain on the border of the Bačka and Syrmia geographical regions. Lying on the banks of the Danube river, the city faces the northern slopes of Fruška Gora and it is the fifth largest of all cities on the Danube river. It is the largest Danube city that is not the capital of an independent state.

, the population of the city proper area totals 295,650 while its urban area (including the adjacent settlements of Petrovaradin and Sremska Kamenica) comprises 327,174 inhabitants. According to the city&#x27;s Informatika Agency, Novi Sad had 414,718 inhabitants (metro area) in 2025.

Novi Sad was founded in 1694, when Serb merchants formed a colony across the Danube from the Petrovaradin Fortress, a strategic Habsburg military post. In subsequent centuries, it became an important trading, manufacturing and cultural centre, and has historically been dubbed &quot;the Serbian Athens&quot;. The city was heavily devastated in the 1848 Revolution, but was subsequently rebuilt and restored. Today, along with the Serbian capital city of Belgrade, Novi Sad is an industrial and financial center important to the Serbian economy.

Novi Sad was the European Youth Capital in 2019 and the European Capital of Culture in 2022. It became a UNESCO Creative City of Media Arts in 2023.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Novi Sad&quot; means &quot;new plantation&quot; in Serbo-Croatian. Its Latin name, stemming from the establishment of Habsburg city rights, is &quot;Neoplanta&quot;. The official names of Novi Sad in local administration are:
*
*

In both Croatian and Romanian, which are official in provincial administration, the city is called &quot;Novi Sad&quot;. Historically, the city was called &quot;Neusatz&quot; and &quot;Neusatz an der Donau&quot; (translated as &#x27;Novi Sad on the Danube&#x27;) in German.

In its wider meaning, the name &quot;Grad Novi Sad&quot; refers to the &quot;City of Novi Sad&quot;, one of the city-level administrative units of Serbia, which includes Novi Sad proper on the left bank of the Danube, the towns of Sremska Kamenica and Petrovaradin on the right bank and the extensive suburbs of the left bank. &quot;Novi Sad&quot; can also refer strictly to only the urban areas of the city (Novi Sad proper and the towns of Sremska Kamenica and Petrovaradin), or only to the historical core on the left bank, i.e. Novi Sad proper excluding Sremska Kamenica and Petrovaradin.

== History ==

=== Older settlements ===


Human habitation in the territory of present-day Novi Sad has been traced as far back as the Stone Age. Several settlements and necropolises dating to 5000 BC were unearthed during the construction of a new boulevard in Avijatičarsko Naselje. A settlement was also identified on the right bank of the river Danube in present-day Petrovaradin.

In antiquity, the region was inhabited by Celtic tribes, most notably the Scordisci. Celts had been present in the area since the 4th century BC and founded the first fortress on the right bank of the Danube. Later, in the 1st century BC, the region was conquered by the Romans. During Roman rule, a larger fortress was built in the 1st century, named &quot;Cusum&quot;, and included in the Roman province of Pannonia.

In the 5th century, Cusum was devastated by Hunnic invasions. By the end of the century, the Byzantines had rebuilt the town and called it &quot;Petrikon&quot; or &quot;Petrikov&quot; () after Saint Peter. Slavic tribes such as the Severians, the Obotrites and the Serbs (including the subtribes of the Braničevci and the Timočani) settled the region around Novi Sad, mainly in the 6th and 7th centuries. The Serbs absorbed the aforementioned Slavic groups as well as the Paleo-Balkanic peoples of the region.

In the Middle Ages, the area was controlled by the Ostrogoths, Gepids, Avars, Franks, West Slavic groups, again by the Byzantines, and finally by the Hungarians. It was a part of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary from its foundation in 1000 until the Ottoman invasion in the 16th century. Hungarians began to settle in the area, which before that time had been mostly populated by Slavs. The earliest known mention was as the Hungarian variant &quot;Peturwarad&quot; or &quot;Pétervárad&quot; (Serbian: &quot;Petrovaradin&quot;/Петроварадин), derived from the Byzantine variant, found in documents from 1237. That year, several other settlements were mentioned as existing in the territory of modern-day urban Novi Sad.

From the 13th century to the 16th century, the following settlements existed in the urban territory of the modern-day Novi Sad:
*on the right bank of the Danube: &quot;Pétervárad&quot; () and &quot;Kamanc&quot; ().
*on the left bank of the Danube: &quot;Baksa&quot; or &quot;Baksafalva&quot; (), &quot;Kűszentmárton&quot; (), &quot;Bivalyos&quot; or &quot;Bivalo&quot; (), &quot;Vásárosvárad&quot; or &quot;Várad&quot; (), &quot;Zajol I&quot; (), &quot;Zajol II&quot; (), &quot;Bistritz&quot; (). Some other settlements existed in the suburbs of Novi Sad: &quot;Mortályos&quot; (Serbian: &quot;Mrtvaljoš&quot;), &quot;Csenei&quot; (), &quot;Keménd&quot; (), &quot;Rév&quot; ().

An etymology of settlement names reveals that some designations are of Slavic origin, which indicates that the areas were initially inhabited by Slavs, particularly the West Slavs. For example, Bivalo (Bivaljoš) had a large Slavic settlement dating from the 5th–6th centuries. Other names are of Hungarian origin (for example Bélakút, Kűszentmárton, Vásárosvárad, Rév), indicating that the settlements were inhabited by Hungarians before the Ottoman invasion in the 16th century. Some settlement names are of uncertain origin.

Tax records from 1522 show a mix of Hungarian and Slavic names among the inhabitants of these villages, including Slavic names like Bozso (Božo), Radovan, Radonya (Radonja), Ivo, etc. Following the Ottoman invasion in the 16th–17th centuries, some of these settlements were destroyed. Most of the surviving Hungarian inhabitants retreated from the area. Some of the settlements persisted under Ottoman rule and were populated by ethnic Serbs.

Between 1526 and 1687, the region was under Ottoman rule. In 1590, the population of all villages in the territory of present-day Novi Sad numbered 105 houses, inhabited exclusively by Serbs. Ottoman records mention only those who paid taxes, so the number of Serbs who lived in the area (for example, those that served in the Ottoman army) was likely larger than was recorded.

=== Founding of Novi Sad ===
Habsburg rule was aligned with the Roman Catholic doctrine and, as it took over this area near the end of the 17th century, the government prohibited people of Orthodox faith from residing in Petrovaradin. Unable to build homes there, the Serbs of the area founded a new settlement in 1694 on the left bank of the Danube. They initially called it the &#x27;Serb city&#x27; (, ). Another name used for the settlement was Petrovaradinski Šanac. In 1718, the inhabitants of the village of Almaš were resettled to Petrovaradinski Šanac, where they founded Almaški Kraj (&#x27;the Almaš quarter&#x27;).

According to 1720 data, the population of Ratzen Stadt was composed of 112 Serbian, 14 German, and 5 Hungarian houses. The settlement officially gained the present names &quot;Novi Sad&quot; and &quot;Újvidék&quot; (&quot;Neoplanta&quot; in Latin) in 1748 when it became a &#x27;free royal city&#x27;, in German language it was called Neusatz.

The edict that made Novi Sad a &#x27;free royal city&#x27; was proclaimed on 1 February 1748. The edict reads:
In the 18th century, the Habsburg monarchy recruited Germans from the southern principalities of the Holy Roman Empire to relocate to the Danube valley. They wanted both to increase the population and to redevelop the river valley for agriculture, which had declined markedly under the Ottomans. To encourage such settlement, the government ensured that the German communities could practice their religion (mostly Catholicism) and use their original German dialect.

=== Habsburg monarchy ===

For much of the 18th and 19th centuries, Novi Sad remained the largest city inhabited by Serbs. The reformer of the Serbian language, Vuk Stefanović Karadžić, wrote in 1817 that Novi Sad was the &#x27;largest Serb municipality in the world&#x27;. It was a cultural and political centre for Serbs (see also Serbian Revival), who did not have their own national state at the time. Due to its cultural and political influence, the city became known as the &#x27;Serbian Athens&#x27; (&quot;Srpska Atina&quot; in Serbian). According to 1843 data, Novi Sad had 17,332 inhabitants, of whom 9,675 were Orthodox Christians, 5,724 Catholics, 1,032 Protestants, 727 Jews, and 30 adherents of the Armenian church. The largest ethnic group in the city were Serbs, and the second largest were Germans.

During the Revolution of 1848–49, Novi Sad was part of Serbian Vojvodina, a Serbian autonomous region within the Austrian Empire. In 1849, the Hungarian garrison, located at the Petrovaradin Fortress, bombarded and devastated the city, which lost much of its population. According to the 1850 census, there were only 7,182 citizens left in the city, compared to 17,332 in 1843. Marija Trandafil and her husband paid for some of the rebuilding including two churches. Between 1849 and 1860, Novi Sad was part of a separate Austrian crownland known as the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar. After the abolishment of this province, the city was included into the Batsch-Bodrog County. The post office was opened in 1853.

Following the compromise of 1867, Novi Sad was located within the Kingdom of Hungary, the &quot;Transleithania&quot;, which comprised half of the new Austro-Hungarian Empire. During this time, the Magyarization policy of the Hungarian government drastically altered the demographic structure of the city as the formerly predominantly Serbian population became one with a more mixed character. In 1880, 41.2% of the city&#x27;s inhabitants used the Serbian language most frequently and 25.9% employed Hungarian. In the following decades, the percentage of Serbian-speakers decreased, while the number of Hungarian-speakers increased. According to the 1910 census, the city had 33,590 residents, of whom 13,343 (39.72%) spoke Hungarian, 11,594 (34.52%) Serbian, 5,918 (17.62%) German and 1,453 (4.33%) Slovak. It is not certain whether Hungarians or Serbs were the larger ethnic group in the city in 1910, since the various ethnic groups (Bunjevci, Romani, Jews, other South Slavic people, etc.) were classified in census results only according to the language they spoke.

Similar demographic changes can be seen in the religious structure: in 1870, the population of Novi Sad included 8,134 Orthodox Christians, 6,684 Catholics, 1,725 Calvinists, 1,343 Lutherans, and others. In 1910, the population included 13,383 Roman Catholics and 11,553 Orthodox Christians, while 3,089 declared themselves as Lutheran, 2,751 as Calvinist, and 2,326 as Jewish.

=== Serbia and Yugoslavia ===
On 25 November 1918, the Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci and other Slavs of Vojvodina in Novi Sad proclaimed the union of the region of Vojvodina with the Kingdom of Serbia. From 1 December 1918, Novi Sad was part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes; and in 1929, it became the capital of the Danube Banovina, a province of the newly named Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In 1921, the population of Novi Sad numbered 39,122 inhabitants, 16,293 of whom spoke the Serbian language, 12,991 Hungarian, 6,373 German, 1,117 Slovak, etc.

In 1941, Yugoslavia was invaded and partitioned by the Axis powers, and its northern parts, including Novi Sad, were annexed by Hungary. During World War II, about 5,000 citizens were murdered and many others were resettled. During the three days of the Novi Sad raid (21–23 January 1942) alone, Hungarian police killed 1,246 citizens, among them more than 800 Jews, and threw their corpses into the icy waters of the Danube.
The total death toll of the raid was around 2,500. Citizens of all nationalities—Serbs, Hungarians, Slovaks, and others—fought together against the Axis authorities. In 1975 the whole city was awarded the title People&#x27;s Hero of Yugoslavia.
The Yugoslav Partisans of Syrmia and Bačka entered the city on 23 October 1944. During the military administration of Banat, Bačka and Baranja (17 October 1944 – 27 January 1945), the Partisans killed tens of thousands, mostly Serbs, Germans, and Hungarians, who were perceived as opponents to the new regime.

Novi Sad became part of the new Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Since 1945, Novi Sad has been the capital of Vojvodina, a province of the Republic of Serbia. The city went through rapid industrialization and its population more than doubled in the period between World War II and the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s.

After 1992, Novi Sad became a part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Devastated by NATO bombardment during the Kosovo War of 1999, Novi Sad was left without any of its three Danube bridges (Žeželj Bridge, Varadin Bridge and Liberty Bridge), communications, water, and electricity. Residential areas were cluster-bombed several times while the oil refinery was bombarded daily, causing severe pollution and widespread ecological damage. In 2003, FR Yugoslavia was transformed into the state union of Serbia and Montenegro. These two states separated in June 2006 (following the May 2006 Montenegrin independence referendum), leaving Novi Sad part of the Republic of Serbia.

On 1 November 2024, the canopy of the main railway station in Novi Sad collapsed, killing fifteen people. The incident sparked a series of mass protests against government corruption.

== Geography ==

The city lies on the meander of the river Danube, which is only 350 meters wide beneath the marking stones of Petrovaradin. A section of the Danube-Tisza-Danube Canal marks the northern edge of the wider city centre. The main part of the city lies on the left bank of the Danube in the region of Bačka, while the smaller settlements of Petrovaradin and Sremska Kamenica lie on the right bank, in the region of Srem (Syrmia). The section situated on the left bank of the river lies on one of the southernmost and lowest parts of the Pannonian Plain, while Fruška Gora on the right bank is a horst mountain. Alluvial plains along the Danube are well-formed, especially on the left bank, and in some parts from the river. A large part of Novi Sad lies on a fluvial terrace with an elevation of between . The northern part of Fruška Gora is composed of massive landslide zones, although they are largely inactive with the exception of the Ribnjak neighbourhood between Sremska Kamenica and Petrovaradin Fortress.

The total land area of the city is , while its urban area spans .

=== Climate ===
Novi Sad has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfa&quot;) closely bordering on humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;) with a January mean of . The city experiences four distinct seasons. Autumn is drier than spring, with long sunny and warm periods. Winter is not so severe, with an average of 22 days of complete sub-zero temperature, and averages 22 days of snowfall. January is the coldest month, with an average low of . Spring is usually short and rainy, while summer arrives abruptly. The coldest temperature ever recorded in Novi Sad was on 24 January 1963, and the hottest temperature ever recorded was on 24 July 2007.
The east-southeasterly wind, known as Košava, blows from the Carpathians and brings clear and dry weather. It mostly blows in autumn and winter, in 2 to 3-day intervals. The average speed of Košava is , but gusts can sometimes reach up to . In wintertime, accompanied by snow storms, the winds can cause large snow-drifts.
== Settlements ==


Novi Sad is a typical Central European town in terms of its architecture. The Town Hall and the Court House were built by Emmerich Kitzweger (1868–1917). The city was almost completely destroyed during the 1848/1849 revolution, so architecture from the 19th century dominates the city centre. Small, older houses used to surround the centre of town, but they are now being replaced by modern, multi-story buildings.

During the socialist period, new city blocks with wide streets and multi-story buildings were constructed around the city core. However, not many communist-style high-rise buildings were erected. The total number of apartment buildings, with ten or more floors, remained at about 50, the rest having mostly three to six floors. From 1962 to 1964, a new boulevard, today called &quot;Bulevar oslobođenja&quot;, was cut through the older neighbourhoods, establishing major communication lines. Several more boulevards were subsequently built in a similar manner, creating an orthogonal network which replaced the primarily radial structure of the old town. These interventions paved the way for a relatively unhampered growth of the city, which has almost tripled in population since the 1950s. Despite a huge increase in car ownership, traffic congestion is still relatively mild, apart from a few major arteries.

=== Neighbourhoods ===

Some of the oldest neighbourhoods in the city are Stari Grad (Old Town), Rotkvarija, Podbara, and Salajka. The areas of Sremska Kamenica and Petrovaradin, located on the right bank of the Danube, were separate towns in the past, but today belong to the urban area of Novi Sad. Liman, as well as Bistrica, are neighbourhoods built during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, with contemporary style buildings and wide boulevards (Liman was divided into four sections, numbered I–IV).

New neighbourhoods, like Liman, Detelinara and Bistrica, emerged from the fields and forests surrounding the city. Following World War II, tall residential buildings were constructed to house the huge influx of people leaving the country side. Many old houses in the city centre, from the Rotkvarija and Bulevar neighbourhoods, were torn down in the 1950s and 1960s, to be replaced by multi-story buildings. Since the city has experienced a major construction boom in the last 10 years, some neighbourhoods like Adamovićevo Naselje have completely been transformed.

Neighbourhoods with single-family homes are mostly located away from the city centre. Telep, situated in the southwest, and Klisa, in the north, are the oldest such districts. Adice and Veternik, both located west of the downtown area, have significantly expanded during the last 15 years, partly due to the influx of Serbian refugees fleeing the Yugoslav wars.

=== Suburbs ===
While Novi Sad&#x27;s urban municipalities, which include Petrovaradin, Sremska Kamenica and Novi Sad proper, have a combined population of about 277,000, its suburban areas have approximately 65,000 inhabitants. Some 23.7% of the administrative city&#x27;s total population resides in the suburbs, which consist of 12 settlements and 1 town. The largest numbers live in Futog (pop. 20,000) and in Veternik (pop. 17,000) to the west. Both places have grown bigger over the years, especially during the 1990s, and have physically merged with the city.

Suburbs like Futog are officially classified as an &#x27;&quot;urban settlement&#x27;&quot; (town), while other suburbs are mostly considered to be &#x27;&quot;rural&quot;&#x27; (village). Ledinci, Stari Ledinci and Bukovac are all villages located on Fruška Gora&#x27;s slopes, with the last two having only one paved road. Stari Ledinci is the most isolated and least populated village belonging to Novi Sad&#x27;s suburban areas.

Towns and villages in the adjacent municipalities of Sremski Karlovci, Temerin and Beočin share the same public transportation system and are economically tied to Novi Sad.

== Demographics ==


Novi Sad is the second largest city in Serbia (after Belgrade), and the largest city in Vojvodina. Since its founding, the population of the city has been constantly increasing. According to the 1991 census, 56.2% of the people who came to Novi Sad from 1961 to 1991 were from Vojvodina, while 15.3% came from Bosnia and Herzegovina and 11.7% from rest of Serbia.

In the 1990s and 2000s, the city experienced significant population growth. According to the 2022 census, the city&#x27;s population is 306,702, while in its urban area (including adjacent settlements of Petrovaradin and Sremska Kamenica) there are 368,967 inhabitants.

=== Ethnic groups ===
The ethnic composition in the city administrative area (last three censuses):
All of the inhabited places in the municipalities have an ethnic Serb majority, while the village of Kisač has an ethnic Slovak majority.

=== Religion ===

According to the 2011 census, the population of the administrative area of Novi Sad (comprising both municipalities) included 270,831 Orthodox Christians, 21,530 Catholics, 8,499 Protestants, 4,760 Muslims, 84 Jews, and others. The city is the seat of the Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Bačka, the seat of the Bishop of the Slovak Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Serbia and of the Muftiship of Novi Sad of the Islamic Community in Serbia.

== Culture ==

In the 19th and early 20th century, Novi Sad was the capital of Serbian culture, earning it the nickname &quot;Serbian Athens&quot;. During that time, many Serbian novelists, poets, jurists, and publishers had lived or worked in Novi Sad at some point in their career, including Vuk Stefanović Karadžić, Mika Antić, Đura Jakšić and Jovan Jovanović Zmaj, among others. Matica srpska, the oldest cultural-scientific institution in Serbia, was moved from Budapest to Novi Sad in 1864, and now contains the second-largest library in the country, the Library of Matica srpska, with over 3.5 million volumes. The Serbian National Theatre, one of the oldest professional theatre among the South Slavs, was founded in Novi Sad in 1861.

Today, Novi Sad is the second largest cultural centre in Serbia, after Belgrade. Municipal officials have made the city more attractive with numerous cultural events and music concerts. Since 2000, Novi Sad is home to the EXIT festival, one of the biggest music summer festivals in Europe. Other important cultural events include the Sterijino pozorje theatre festival, Zmaj Children Games, International Novi Sad Literature Festival, Novi Sad Jazz Festival, and many others. Novi Sad also hosts a fashion show twice a year, attracting local and international designers. Called Serbia Fashion Week, the event also features the works of applied artists, musicians, interior decorators, multimedia experts and architects.

In addition to the Serbian National Theatre, other prominent playhouses consist of the Novi Sad Theatre, Novi Sad Youth Theatre, and the Cultural Centre of Novi Sad. The Novi Sad Synagogue also houses many cultural events. Other cultural institutions include the Detachment of the Serbian Academy of Science and Art, Library of Matica Srpska, Novi Sad City Library and Azbukum. The city is also home to the Archive of Vojvodina, which has collected numerous documents from the Vojvodina region dating back to 1565.

Novi Sad has several folk song societies, which are known as &quot;kulturno-umetničko društvo&quot; or KUD. The best known societies in the city are: KUD Svetozar Marković, AKUD Sonja Marinković, SKUD Željezničar, FA Vila and the oldest SZPD Neven, established in 1892.

National minorities express their own traditions, folklore and songs through various societies such as the Hungarian MKUD Petőfi Sándor, Slovak SKUD Pavel Jozef Šafárik, and Ruthenian RKC Novi Sad.

Novi Sad was chosen to be the European Capital of Culture for 2021, however its mandate was moved to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. From this mandate, the industrial zone in Liman neighborhood was repurposed as an artist quarter known as &quot;Distrikt&quot;. Due the continued efforts of local artists, the city became a UNESCO Creative City of Media Arts in 2023.

=== Cuisine ===
Typical Serbian food can be found in Novi Sad, including traditional dishes like ćevapi, burek, kajmak, kiseli kupus, kiflice and pasulj, as well as fish dishes, local cheeses and charcuterie. Restaurants and farmsteads offer fresh produce from local farmers and also regional vintages from Fruska Gora&#x27;s wineries.

== Economy ==
Novi Sad is the economic centre of Vojvodina, the most fertile agricultural region in Serbia. The city also represents one of the largest economic and cultural hubs in Serbia.

Novi Sad had always been a developed city within the former Yugoslavia. In 1981, its GDP per capita was 172% of the Yugoslav average. During the 1990s, the city, like the rest of Serbia, was severely affected by an internationally imposed trade embargo and hyperinflation of the Yugoslav dinar. The embargo, along with economic mismanagement, led to a decay or demise of once important industrial combines, such as &quot;Novkabel&quot; (electric cable industry), &quot;Pobeda&quot; (metal industry), &quot;Jugoalat&quot; (tools), &quot;Albus&quot; and &quot;HINS&quot; (chemical industry). Practically the only viable large facilities remaining today are the oil refinery, located northeast of the city, and the thermal power plant.

The economy of Novi Sad has mostly recovered from that period and grown strongly since 2001, shifting from an industry-driven economy to the tertiary sector. The processes involved in privatizing state and society-owned enterprises, as well as strong private incentives, have increased the share of privately owned companies to over 95% in the district, with small and medium-size enterprises dominating the city&#x27;s economic development.

The significance of Novi Sad as a financial centre is already proven, by being home to the national headquarters of numerous banks, such as Erste Bank, Vojvođanska banka, and Crédit Agricole; as well as the third largest insurance company in Serbia, DDOR Novi Sad. Furthermore, the city is home to major energy companies like Naftna Industrija Srbije oil company and Srbijagas gas company. It is also the seat of many farms for wheat production and trade.
Novi Sad is also a growing information technology centre within Serbia, second only to Belgrade. As many as 900 IT companies operate in Novi Sad out of a total of 2,500 registered in the territory of the Republic of Serbia with over 11,500 employees. As of September 2017, Novi Sad has one of 14 free economic zones established in Serbia.

<text>Carloman II ( 866 – 6 December 884) was the King of West Francia (future France) from 879 until his death. A member of the Carolingian dynasty, he and his elder brother Louis III, divided the kingdom between themselves and ruled jointly until the latter&#x27;s death in 882. Thereafter Carloman ruled alone until his own death. He was the second son of King Louis the Stammerer and Queen Ansgarde.

Upon Louis the Stammerer&#x27;s death, some Frankish nobles advocated electing Louis III as the sole king, but eventually both brothers were elected kings. They were both crowned in September 879. Some doubts were cast upon the legitimacy of their birth, but these disappeared after their victory over the Vikings on November of that year. In March 880, the brothers divided their father&#x27;s realm at Amiens, Carloman receiving the southern kingdoms of Burgundy and Aquitaine.

Meanwhile, the powerful Duke Boso of Provence had renounced his allegiance to both brothers and had been elected King of Provence on October 879. In 880, Carloman and Louis III marched against Boso and took the northern parts of his realm, starting a two-year siege in Vienne. The city was finally taken by Richard, Duke of Burgundy, in 882.

Carloman II died near Les Andelys while hunting on December 884. He was accidentally stabbed in the leg by his servant Bertoldus while they were attacked by a wild boar. Carloman survived but died seven days later, on 5–6 December. He was only about 18 years old. Some modern sources give his death date as 12 December, but this is not corroborated by contemporary sources. Carloman&#x27;s land were inherited by his cousin, the emperor Charles the Fat.

<text>Desiderius, also known as Daufer or Dauferius (born – died ), was king of the Lombards in northern Italy, ruling from 756 to 774. The Frankish king of renown, Charlemagne, married Desiderius&#x27;s daughter and subsequently conquered his realm. Desiderius is remembered for this connection to Charlemagne and for being the last Lombard ruler to exercise regional kingship.

==Rise to power==
Born in Brescia, Desiderius was originally a royal officer, the &quot;dux&quot; of Tuscia and he became king after the death of Aistulf in 756. At that time, Aistulf&#x27;s predecessor, Ratchis, left his monastic retreat of Montecassino and tried to seize the kingdom, but Desiderius put his revolt down quickly with the support of Pope Stephen II. At his coronation, Desiderius promised to restore many lost papal towns to the Holy See and even enlarge the Papal State.

By 757, Desiderius began securing his power, taking what historian Walter Goffart terms, &quot;vigorous steps to suppress resistance to himself in the powerful duchies of Spoleto, in central Italy, and Benevento, to the south.&quot; When the upstart Liutprand (Duke of Benevento)—who despised Desiderius—challenged his kingship and threatened to place himself under the protection of Pepin the Short, Desiderius obtained naval assistance from Byzantium and put an end to Luitprand&#x27;s defiant actions. The Lombard king then granted Luitprand&#x27;s former duchy to his foe&#x27;s son, Arechis. In that same year, Desiderius deposed Alboin of Spoleto and exercised the ducal powers there himself. Seeking, like his predecessors, to extend Lombard power in Italy, Desiderius challenged the papacy and vied for the southern duchies. In the August of 759, Desiderius made his son Adelchis associate King of Lombardy.

Shortly after visiting Rome, where he prayed at the tomb of St. Peter, Desiderius &quot;returned to the aggressive expansive policy of his predecessors.&quot; He even negotiated with Byzantium in an arrangement that would have eroded papal authority and resulted in further territorial loss for the Holy See in Rome. Sometime in 760, envoys from Pepin convinced Desiderius to return some of the cities he captured back to the papacy, but the Lombard king did not follow through on his promises.

==Appointing Antipope Philip==
Intervening in the crisis that ensued after the death of Pope Paul I in 767, Desiderius seized a priest named Philip from the Monastery of St. Vitus on the Esquiline Hill in Rome on Sunday, July 31, 768, and summarily appointed him pope. Antipope Philip was not recognized and failed to gain a significant following, so he left the same day and returned to his monastery, where he was never heard from or seen again.

==Carolingian Intervention==
While Pepin’s previous military campaigns in Italy against Desiderius&#x27; Lombard predecessors had been successful, the subsequent relations between the papacy (aligned with the Carolingians) and the Lombards were correspondingly strained and in 773, Pope Hadrian openly broke with king Desiderius. When Desiderius responded by moving against the papal cities, Hadrian immediately appealed to Charlemagne for help against the Lombards. Since the Lombards had blocked the passage through the Alps, Pope Hadrian had to send his embassy by sea; they were commissioned to remind Charlemagne that he was the protector of the papacy.

Originally, Charlemagne had remained on amicable terms with the Lombards, having been married to Desiderius’ daughter, Desiderata. Despite not liking the alliance between Lombards and Franks, Stephen III grudgingly maintained positive diplomatic standing with both kings, but his death in February 772 and the elevation of Pope Hadrian, who wished to undermine this relationship, altered the political environment. Hadrian hedged his bets and took measures to provoke Desiderius; actions designed to make him take an aggressive stance against the Holy See so an appeal could be made for Frankish assistance. Upon hearing the call for help, Charlemagne obliged the Holy See. Carloman&#x27;s death also changed the situation. It seems the widow of Charlemagne’s brother (Carloman) and her children had taken refuge with Desiderius, who—so it was alleged in the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;—intended to proclaim a Frankish successor. According to historian Roger Collins, the veracity of this claim can be questioned as a possible piece of disinformation from the papacy &quot;intended to ensure the Frankish king’s help against the Lombards.&quot;

During the spring of 773, Charlemagne sent two Frankish armies against the Lombards and after an eight month siege, captured the capital of Pavia and Desiderius himself. Charlemagne subsequently exiled the Lombard king to the abbey of Corbie in northern France, and as “king of the Franks”, added the title “and of the Lombards”, lengthening his moniker. When Charlemagne took the title &quot;rex Langobardorum&quot;, it marked the first time a Germanic king adopted the title of a kingdom he had conquered. Although Charlemagne had the power to destroy the Lombards outright, he instead permitted them to &quot;retain their laws and pardoned those who were traitors.&quot; In the end, Desiderius&#x27;s ambitions brought about the end of the Lombard kingdom and he was the final Lombard king on record.

==Family==

He married Ansa (or Ansia) and, as well as a son, had five daughters:

*Anselperga (or Anselberga), abbess of San Salvatore monastery of Brescia
*Adelperga (or Adelberga), married Arechis II of Benevento
*Liutperga (also Liutpirc or Liutberga), married Tassilo III of Bavaria
*Desiderata married Charlemagne in 770 and was repudiated (a medieval form of divorce) in 771.
*Gerperga (or Gerberga) married Carloman brother of Charlemagne 
*Adelchis (or Adalgis), patrician in Constantinople

==Legacy==
Today, the legacy of Desiderius still has significance in Italy. The beautiful monastic church of San Salvatore in Brescia, a testament to Lombard architecture still enduring, was constructed by Desiderius. His name in Italian—&quot;Desiderio&quot;—directly translates to &quot;desire&quot; in English. In the tragedy &quot;Adelchi&quot;, written by renowned Italian novelist and Poet Alessandro Manzoni in 1822, Desiderius is portrayed as vain man, destroying his kingdom and legacy over his desire for power. His son Adelchi (also called Adalgis) is torn over his father&#x27;s will and his desire for peace, and dies of starvation. In the play, the author expresses regret that Desiderius and Lombards failed to unite the Italian peninsula.
Dante Alighieri in Paradiso VI (line 95) refers to Desiderius as the &quot;Lombard tooth&quot; (or &quot;snake&quot;) who bit the Holy Church and was subsequently defeated by Charlemagne.

<doc id="113295" wikidata="Q508815" url="?curid=113295" title="Carnuntum">
<text>Carnuntum ( according to Ptolemy) was a Roman legionary fortress () and headquarters of the Pannonian fleet from 50 AD. After the 1st century, it was capital of the Pannonia Superior province. It also became a large city of approximately 50,000 inhabitants.

Its impressive remains are situated on the Danube in Lower Austria halfway between Vienna and Bratislava in the Carnuntum Archaeological Park extending over an area of 10 km2 near today&#x27;s villages of Petronell-Carnuntum and Bad Deutsch-Altenburg.

==History==
===Military history===
Carnuntum first occurs in history during the reign of Augustus (6 AD), when Tiberius made it his base of operations as a Roman fort () in the campaigns against Maroboduus (Marbod).

====Legio XV ====
Significant Romanisation happened when the town was selected as the garrison of the Legio XV before 14 AD. A few years later, it became the centre of the Roman fortifications along the Danube from Vindobona (now Vienna) to Brigetio (Ó-Szőny). According to Tacitus, the emperor Claudius ordered the governor of Pannonia &quot;to have a legion with an auxiliary on the bank of the Danube&quot; to protect the losers of a dispute between Germanic tribes (the Quadi and Marcomanni) and deter the victors from the temptation to invade Pannonia. To this period (about 50 AD) belongs the auxiliary of a cavalry  1.5 km south-west of the legionary fortress.

In 71 AD, after several campaigns, the Legio XV &quot;Apollinaris&quot; returned to Carnuntum and rebuilt its fortress. While some of the legion fought in Trajan&#x27;s Dacian Wars, the main body of the legion remained in Pannonia.

====Legio X ====
Legio X was sent to Carnuntum for a few years from about 63 AD. During the brief reign of Galba (68–69), it was transferred back to Hispania.

====Legio VII ====
Legio VII, newly founded by Galba in 68 AD, was allocated to Carnuntum until about 71 AD after his defeat by Vespasian.

====Legio XIV ====
In 117–118 AD, Carnuntum became the permanent quarters of Legio XIV where it stayed for three centuries until the frontier collapsed in 430.

===History of the city===
In Roman times, Carnuntum had a history as a major trading centre for amber, brought from the north to traders who sold it in Italy; the main arm of the Amber Road crossed the Danube at Carnuntum.

As , the capital of Pannonia Superior, it was made a by Hadrian. Its importance is indicated by the fact that Marcus Aurelius resided there for three years (172–175) during the war against the Marcomanni, and wrote part of his &quot;Meditations&quot; there. Also Septimius Severus, at the time governor of Pannonia, was proclaimed emperor there by his soldiers (193), to replace Emperor Pertinax, who had been murdered.

In the Severan dynasty (193–235), Carnuntum experienced an economic boom, the reaching their maximum size. Caracalla elevated it to status as . He was killed shortly afterwards by his own soldiers, probably at Carnuntum.

In 308, during the Civil wars of the Tetrarchy, the Emperor emeritus Diocletian chaired a historic meeting there, the Conference of Carnuntum, with his co-emperors Maximian and Galerius, to solve the rising tensions within the tetrarchy.

Around 350 Carnuntum suffered severe earthquake damage.

In 374, it was destroyed by Germanic invaders, the Quadi and Iazyges. Although partly restored by Valentinian I, it never regained its former importance, and Vindobona became the chief military centre. During the Barbarian Invasions, Carnuntum was eventually abandoned and used as a cemetery and source of building material for building projects elsewhere. Eventually, its remains became buried and forgotten.
==Today==
The Archaeological Park Carnuntum comprises three sites:
* Museum, Heidentor and amphitheatre near Petronell
* Excavations in the garden of Petronell Castle
* Museum Carnuntinum

===Civilian city===

The remains of the civilian city extend around the village Petronell-Carnuntum. There are several places to see in the city: Roman city quarter in the open-air museum, palace ruins, amphitheatre, and Heidentor.

The Roman city ruins are exposed in the open-air museum directly in the present village. One of the ancient houses, called the House of Lucius, has been rebuilt using traditional techniques. It was opened to the public on 1 June 2006.

The was next to the palace ruins, also referred to as the large public baths.

Some way outside the city was a large amphitheatre, which had room for about 15,000 spectators.
A plate with an inscription found at the site claims that this building was the fourth largest amphitheatre in the whole Roman Empire.

===Heidentor===
Between 354 AD and 361 AD, a huge triumphal monument was erected next to the camp and city. Contemporary reports suggest that Emperor Constantius II had it built to commemorate his victories. When the remains of Carnuntum disappeared after the Migration Period the monument remained as an isolated building in a natural landscape and led Medieval people to believe it was the tomb of a pagan giant. Hence, they called it (&#x27;Heathens&#x27; Gate&#x27; or &#x27;Pagans&#x27; Gate&#x27;).

===Fortress===

The only remaining building of the fortress is an amphitheatre, located just outside the fortress. Today, a small adjacent museum shows the history of gladiators.

==Culture==
The World Theatre Festival Art Carnumtum () is held each year in the ancient amphitheatre. Art Carnuntum is a cultural organisation that aims support the cultural and philosophical heritage of Europe and promotes classical drama in both traditional and contemporary styles. The festival was founded around 1988 by the italian artist Piero Bordin, who died suddenly in March 2021. Since 2021 Constantina Bordin is the new artistic director. Collaborators from Greece include Irini Pappas, Michalis Kakogianis, and Theodoros Terzopoulus, and the popular festival has become known as an international centre for ancient drama as well as European classical and modern music.

The festival was held in August in 2021.

===Gladiator school===
In September 2011 aerial photographs and ground-penetrating radar led to the discovery of the typical contours of an ancient Roman gladiator school to the south of the Roman settlement, a rivaling the Ludus Magnus school and covering an area of some . This approach of aerial photography and modern remote sensing has allowed for a detailed virtual recreation of the gladiator school. The aerial photographs used in the recreation were acquired with a radio-controlled Microdrone md4-1000 quadrocopter, which captured a sufficient number of photographs to create an overlap among them. Then, using a technique called &quot;structure from motion (SfM)&quot;, a 3D model of the school was calculated using the sharpest images.

The school, along with the amphitheater, was located outside of the town&#x27;s walls. The school had training grounds, bathing facilities, an assembly hall and dormitories for the gladiators. The school also had a courtyard which housed a training area for gladiators. The school was attached to an open campus which was most likely used for chariot races.

===Museum Carnuntinum===

The archaeological museum Carnuntinum, which is situated in the village of Bad Deutsch-Altenburg on the river Danube, exhibits important archeological finds from the ancient city.

==In fiction==
Völkisch author Guido von List was so impressed with the ruins that he based his first novel, &quot;Carnuntum&quot;, on the subject. Another novel, &quot;Household Gods&quot;, by Harry Turtledove and Judith Tarr, is set in Carnuntum during the reign of Marcus Aurelius, from the point of view of a modern American time traveler.

In Frank Tallis&#x27;s crime novel &quot;Vienna Blood&quot;, both Guido von List and his novel &quot;Carnuntum&quot; appear, together with an eponymous opera based on the novel.
