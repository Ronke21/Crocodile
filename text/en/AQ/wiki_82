<text>In probability theory and statistics, the chi-squared distribution (also chi-square or formula_1-distribution) with formula_2 degrees of freedom is the distribution of a sum of the squares of formula_2 independent standard normal random variables.

The chi-squared distribution formula_4 is a special case of the gamma distribution and the univariate Wishart distribution. Specifically if
formula_5 then formula_6 (where formula_7 is the shape parameter and formula_8 the scale parameter of the gamma distribution) and formula_9.

The scaled chi-squared distribution formula_10 is a reparametrization of the gamma distribution and the univariate Wishart distribution. Specifically if
formula_11 then formula_12 and formula_13.

The chi-squared distribution is one of the most widely used probability distributions in inferential statistics, notably in hypothesis testing and in construction of confidence intervals. This distribution is sometimes called the central chi-squared distribution, a special case of the more general noncentral chi-squared distribution.

The chi-squared distribution is used in the common chi-squared tests for goodness of fit of an observed distribution to a theoretical one, the independence of two criteria of classification of qualitative data, and in finding the confidence interval for estimating the population standard deviation of a normal distribution from a sample standard deviation. Many other statistical tests also use this distribution, such as Friedman&#x27;s analysis of variance by ranks.

== Definitions ==
If are independent, standard normal random variables, then the sum of their squares,
: formula_14
is distributed according to the chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom. This is usually denoted as
: formula_15

The chi-squared distribution has one parameter: a positive integer that specifies the number of degrees of freedom (the number of random variables being summed, &quot;Z&quot;&quot;i&quot; s).

=== Introduction ===

The chi-squared distribution is used primarily in hypothesis testing, and to a lesser extent for confidence intervals for population variance when the underlying distribution is normal. Unlike more widely known distributions such as the normal distribution and the exponential distribution, the chi-squared distribution is not as often applied in the direct modeling of natural phenomena. It arises in the following hypothesis tests, among others:
* Chi-squared test of independence in contingency tables
* Chi-squared test of goodness of fit of observed data to hypothetical distributions
* Likelihood-ratio test for nested models
* Log-rank test in survival analysis
* Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test for stratified contingency tables
* Wald test
* Score test

It is also a component of the definition of the &quot;t&quot;-distribution and the &quot;F&quot;-distribution used in &quot;t&quot;-tests, analysis of variance, and regression analysis.

The primary reason for which the chi-squared distribution is extensively used in hypothesis testing is its relationship to the normal distribution. Many hypothesis tests use a test statistic, such as the &quot;t&quot;-statistic in a &quot;t&quot;-test. For these hypothesis tests, as the sample size, , increases, the sampling distribution of the test statistic approaches the normal distribution (central limit theorem). Because the test statistic (such as ) is asymptotically normally distributed, provided the sample size is sufficiently large, the distribution used for hypothesis testing may be approximated by a normal distribution. Testing hypotheses using a normal distribution is well understood and relatively easy. The simplest chi-squared distribution is the square of a standard normal distribution. So wherever a normal distribution could be used for a hypothesis test, a chi-squared distribution could be used.

Suppose that formula_16 is a random variable sampled from the standard normal distribution, where the mean is formula_17 and the variance is formula_18: formula_19. Now, consider the random variable formula_20. The distribution of the random variable formula_21 is an example of a chi-squared distribution: formula_22. The subscript 1 indicates that this particular chi-squared distribution is constructed from only 1 standard normal distribution. A chi-squared distribution constructed by squaring a single standard normal distribution is said to have 1 degree of freedom. Thus, as the sample size for a hypothesis test increases, the distribution of the test statistic approaches a normal distribution. Just as extreme values of the normal distribution have low probability (and give small p-values), extreme values of the chi-squared distribution have low probability.

An additional reason that the chi-squared distribution is widely used is that it turns up as the large sample distribution of generalized likelihood ratio tests (LRT). LRTs have several desirable properties; in particular, simple LRTs commonly provide the highest power to reject the null hypothesis (Neyman–Pearson lemma) and this leads also to optimality properties of generalised LRTs. However, the normal and chi-squared approximations are only valid asymptotically. For this reason, it is preferable to use the &quot;t&quot; distribution rather than the normal approximation or the chi-squared approximation for a small sample size. Similarly, in analyses of contingency tables, the chi-squared approximation will be poor for a small sample size, and it is preferable to use Fisher&#x27;s exact test. Ramsey shows that the exact binomial test is always more powerful than the normal approximation.

Lancaster shows the connections among the binomial, normal, and chi-squared distributions, as follows. De Moivre and Laplace established that a binomial distribution could be approximated by a normal distribution. Specifically they showed the asymptotic normality of the random variable

:formula_23

where formula_24 is the observed number of successes in formula_25 trials, where the probability of success is formula_26, and formula_27.

Squaring both sides of the equation gives

: formula_28

Using formula_29, formula_30, and formula_27, this equation can be rewritten as

: formula_32

The expression on the right is of the form that Karl Pearson would generalize to the form

: formula_33

where

formula_34 = Pearson&#x27;s cumulative test statistic, which asymptotically approaches a formula_1 distribution;
formula_36 = the number of observations of type formula_37;
formula_38 = the expected (theoretical) frequency of type formula_37, asserted by the null hypothesis that the fraction of type formula_37 in the population is formula_41; and
formula_42 = the number of cells in the table.

In the case of a binomial outcome (flipping a coin), the binomial distribution may be approximated by a normal distribution (for sufficiently large formula_43). Because the square of a standard normal distribution is the chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom, the probability of a result such as 1 heads in 10 trials can be approximated either by using the normal distribution directly, or the chi-squared distribution for the normalised, squared difference between observed and expected value. However, many problems involve more than the two possible outcomes of a binomial, and instead require 3 or more categories, which leads to the multinomial distribution. Just as de Moivre and Laplace sought for and found the normal approximation to the binomial, Pearson sought for and found a degenerate multivariate normal approximation to the multinomial distribution (the numbers in each category add up to the total sample size, which is considered fixed). Pearson showed that the chi-squared distribution arose from such a multivariate normal approximation to the multinomial distribution, taking careful account of the statistical dependence (negative correlations) between numbers of observations in different categories.

=== Probability density function ===
The probability density function (pdf) of the chi-squared distribution is
:formula_44
where formula_45 denotes the gamma function, which has closed-form values for integer formula_2.

For derivations of the pdf in the cases of one, two and formula_2 degrees of freedom, see Proofs related to chi-squared distribution.

=== Cumulative distribution function ===

Its cumulative distribution function is:
: formula_48
where formula_49 is the lower incomplete gamma function and formula_50 is the regularized gamma function.

In a special case of formula_51 this function has the simple form:
: formula_52
which can be easily derived by integrating formula_53 directly. The integer recurrence of the gamma function makes it easy to compute formula_54 for other small, even formula_2.

Tables of the chi-squared cumulative distribution function are widely available and the function is included in many spreadsheets and all statistical packages.

Letting formula_56, Chernoff bounds on the lower and upper tails of the CDF may be obtained. For the cases when formula_57 (which include all of the cases when this CDF is less than half):
formula_58

The tail bound for the cases when formula_59, similarly, is
: formula_60

For another approximation for the CDF modeled after the cube of a Gaussian, see under Noncentral chi-squared distribution.

== Properties ==

=== Cochran&#x27;s theorem ===

The following is a special case of Cochran&#x27;s theorem.

Theorem. If formula_61 are independent identically distributed (i.i.d.), standard normal random variables, then
formula_62
where formula_63
Proof. Let formula_64 be a vector of formula_43 independent normally distributed random variables,
and formula_66 their average.
Then
formula_67
where formula_68 is the identity matrix and formula_69 the all ones vector.
formula_70 has one eigenvector formula_71 with eigenvalue formula_17,
and formula_73 eigenvectors formula_74 (all orthogonal to formula_75) with eigenvalue formula_18,
which can be chosen so that formula_77 is an orthogonal matrix.
Since also formula_78,
we have
formula_79
which proves the claim.
=== Additivity ===
It follows from the definition of the chi-squared distribution that the sum of independent chi-squared variables is also chi-squared distributed. Specifically, if formula_80 are independent chi-squared variables with formula_81, formula_82 degrees of freedom, respectively, then formula_83 is chi-squared distributed with formula_84 degrees of freedom.

=== Sample mean ===
The sample mean of formula_43 i.i.d. chi-squared variables of degree formula_2 is distributed according to a gamma distribution with shape formula_7 and scale formula_8 parameters:
:formula_89

Asymptotically, given that for a shape parameter formula_90 going to infinity, a Gamma distribution converges towards a normal distribution with expectation formula_91 and variance formula_92, the sample mean converges towards:

formula_93

Note that we would have obtained the same result invoking instead the central limit theorem, noting that for each chi-squared variable of degree formula_2 the expectation is formula_95 , and its variance formula_96 (and hence the variance of the sample mean formula_97 being formula_98).

=== Entropy ===
The differential entropy is given by
: formula_99
where formula_100 is the Digamma function.

The chi-squared distribution is the maximum entropy probability distribution for a random variate formula_21 for which formula_102 and formula_103 are fixed. Since the chi-squared is in the family of gamma distributions, this can be derived by substituting appropriate values in the Expectation of the log moment of gamma. For derivation from more basic principles, see the derivation in moment-generating function of the sufficient statistic.

=== Noncentral moments ===
The noncentral moments (raw moments) of a chi-squared distribution with formula_2 degrees of freedom are given by
: formula_105

=== Cumulants ===
The cumulants are readily obtained by a power series expansion of the logarithm of the characteristic function:
: formula_106
with cumulant generating function formula_107.

=== Concentration ===

The chi-squared distribution exhibits strong concentration around its mean. The standard Laurent-Massart bounds are:
: formula_108
: formula_109
One consequence is that, if formula_110 is a gaussian random vector in formula_111, then as the dimension formula_2 grows, the squared length of the vector is concentrated tightly around formula_2 with a width formula_114:formula_115where the exponent formula_7 can be chosen as any value in formula_117.

Since the cumulant generating function for formula_118 is formula_119, and its convex dual is formula_120, the standard Chernoff bound yieldsformula_121where formula_122. By the union bound,formula_123This result is used in proving the Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma.

=== Asymptotic properties ===
By the central limit theorem, because the chi-squared distribution is the sum of formula_2 independent random variables with finite mean and variance, it converges to a normal distribution for large formula_2. For many practical purposes, for formula_126 the distribution is sufficiently close to a normal distribution, so the difference is ignorable. Specifically, if formula_127, then as formula_2 tends to infinity, the distribution of formula_129 tends to a standard normal distribution. However, convergence is slow as the skewness is formula_130 and the excess kurtosis is formula_131.

The sampling distribution of formula_132 converges to normality much faster than the sampling distribution of formula_1, as the logarithmic transform removes much of the asymmetry.

Other functions of the chi-squared distribution converge more rapidly to a normal distribution. Some examples are:
* If formula_127 then formula_135 is approximately normally distributed with mean formula_136 and unit variance (1922, by R. A. Fisher, see (18.23), p. 426 of Johnson.
* If formula_127 then formula_138 is approximately normally distributed with mean formula_139 and variance formula_140 This is known as the Wilson–Hilferty transformation, see (18.24), p. 426 of Johnson.
** This normalizing transformation leads directly to the commonly used median approximation formula_141 by back-transforming from the mean, which is also the median, of the normal distribution.

A chi-squared variable with formula_2 degrees of freedom is defined as the sum of the squares of formula_2 independent standard normal random variables.

If formula_182 is a formula_2-dimensional Gaussian random vector with mean vector formula_184 and rank formula_2 covariance matrix formula_186, then formula_187 is chi-squared distributed with formula_2 degrees of freedom.

The sum of squares of statistically independent unit-variance Gaussian variables which do &quot;not&quot; have mean zero yields a generalization of the chi-squared distribution called the noncentral chi-squared distribution.

If formula_182 is a vector of formula_2 i.i.d. standard normal random variables and formula_191 is a formula_192 symmetric, idempotent matrix with rank formula_193, then the quadratic form formula_194 is chi-square distributed with formula_193 degrees of freedom.

If formula_196 is a formula_197 positive-semidefinite covariance matrix with strictly positive diagonal entries, then for formula_198 and formula_199 a random formula_26-vector independent of formula_21 such that formula_202 and formula_203 then

: formula_204

The chi-squared distribution is also naturally related to other distributions arising from the Gaussian. In particular,
* formula_182 is F-distributed, formula_206 if formula_207, where formula_208 and formula_209 are statistically independent.
* If formula_208 and formula_209 are statistically independent, then formula_212. If formula_213 and formula_214 are not independent, then formula_215 is not chi-square distributed.

=== Generalizations ===
The chi-squared distribution is obtained as the sum of the squares of independent, zero-mean, unit-variance Gaussian random variables. Generalizations of this distribution can be obtained by summing the squares of other types of Gaussian random variables. Several such distributions are described below.

=== Linear combination ===
If formula_216 are chi square random variables and formula_217, then the distribution of formula_218 is a special case of a Generalized Chi-squared Distribution.
A closed expression for this distribution is not known. It may be, however, approximated efficiently using the property of characteristic functions of chi-square random variables.

=== Chi-squared distributions ===

==== Noncentral chi-squared distribution ====

The noncentral chi-squared distribution is obtained from the sum of the squares of independent Gaussian random variables having unit variance and &quot;nonzero&quot; means.

==== Generalized chi-squared distribution ====

The generalized chi-squared distribution is obtained from the quadratic form where is a zero-mean Gaussian vector having an arbitrary covariance matrix, and is an arbitrary matrix.

=== Gamma, exponential, and related distributions ===
The chi-squared distribution formula_219 is a special case of the gamma distribution, in that formula_220 using the rate parameterization of the gamma distribution (or
formula_221 using the scale parameterization of the gamma distribution)
where is an integer.

Because the exponential distribution is also a special case of the gamma distribution, we also have that if formula_222, then formula_223 is an exponential distribution.

The Erlang distribution is also a special case of the gamma distribution and thus we also have that if formula_224 with even formula_2, then formula_21 is Erlang distributed with shape parameter formula_227 and scale parameter formula_228.

== Occurrence and applications ==
The chi-squared distribution has numerous applications in inferential statistics, for instance in chi-squared tests and in estimating variances. It enters the problem of estimating the mean of a normally distributed population and the problem of estimating the slope of a regression line via its role in Student&#x27;s t-distribution. It enters all analysis of variance problems via its role in the F-distribution, which is the distribution of the ratio of two independent chi-squared random variables, each divided by their respective degrees of freedom.

Following are some of the most common situations in which the chi-squared distribution arises from a Gaussian-distributed sample.
* if formula_229 are i.i.d. formula_230 random variables, then formula_231 where formula_232.
* The box below shows some statistics based on formula_233 independent random variables that have probability distributions related to the chi-squared distribution:

The chi-squared distribution is also often encountered in magnetic resonance imaging.

== Computational methods ==
=== Table of values vs -values ===
The formula_234-value is the probability of observing a test statistic &quot;at least&quot; as extreme in a chi-squared distribution. Accordingly, since the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the appropriate degrees of freedom &quot;(df)&quot; gives the probability of having obtained a value &quot;less extreme&quot; than this point, subtracting the CDF value from 1 gives the &quot;p&quot;-value. A low &quot;p&quot;-value, below the chosen significance level, indicates statistical significance, i.e., sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. A significance level of 0.05 is often used as the cutoff between significant and non-significant results.

The table below gives a number of &quot;p&quot;-values matching to formula_235 for the first 10 degrees of freedom.
These values can be calculated evaluating the quantile function (also known as &quot;inverse CDF&quot; or &quot;ICDF&quot;) of the chi-squared distribution; e. g., the ICDF for and yields as in the table above, noticing that is the &quot;p&quot;-value from the table.

== History ==
This distribution was first described by the German geodesist and statistician Friedrich Robert Helmert in papers of 1875–6, where he computed the sampling distribution of the sample variance of a normal population. Thus in German this was traditionally known as the &quot;Helmert&#x27;sche&quot; (&quot;Helmertian&quot;) or &quot;Helmert distribution&quot;.

The distribution was independently rediscovered by the English mathematician Karl Pearson in the context of goodness of fit, for which he developed his Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test, published in 1900, with computed table of values published in , collected in .
The name &quot;chi-square&quot; ultimately derives from Pearson&#x27;s shorthand for the exponent in a multivariate normal distribution with the Greek letter Chi, writing for what would appear in modern notation as (Σ being the covariance matrix). The idea of a family of &quot;chi-squared distributions&quot;, however, is not due to Pearson but arose as a further development due to Fisher in the 1920s.

<text>Terms of Endearment is a 1983 American family tragicomedy film directed, written, and produced by James L. Brooks, adapted from Larry McMurtry&#x27;s 1975 novel of the same name. It stars Debra Winger, Shirley MacLaine, Jack Nicholson, Danny DeVito, Jeff Daniels, and John Lithgow. The film covers 30 years of the relationship between Aurora Greenway (MacLaine) and her daughter Emma Greenway-Horton (Winger).

&quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; was theatrically released in limited theatres on November 23, 1983, and to a wider release on December 9 by Paramount Pictures. The film received critical acclaim and was a major commercial success, grossing $165 million at the box office, becoming the second-highest-grossing film of 1983 (after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;). At the 56th Academy Awards, the film received a leading 11 nominations, and won a leading five awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress (MacLaine), Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor (Nicholson). A sequel, &quot;The Evening Star&quot;, was released in 1996.

==Plot==
Aurora Greenway, a widow since her daughter Emma was a young girl, keeps several suitors at arm&#x27;s length in River Oaks, Houston, focusing instead on her close, but controlling, relationship with Emma. Anxious to escape her mother, Emma marries callow young college professor Flap Horton over her mother&#x27;s objections. 

Despite their frequent spats and difficulty getting along with each other, Emma and Aurora have very close ties and keep in touch by telephone. Soon after the wedding, Emma gets pregnant with their first child. He is a few years old when she is again expecting another.

The small family moves to Iowa in order for Flap to pursue a career as an English professor. When they run into financial difficulties, Emma calls Aurora for help. Admitting she is pregnant with a third, her mother suggests she go to Colorado for an abortion.

When Flap gets home, as he was away overnight, Emma demands to be told if he is having an affair. He insists it is paranoia, brought on by the pregnancy hormones. While at the grocery store, Emma does not have enough money to pay for all of her groceries and meets Sam Burns, who helps pay for them. 

Meanwhile the lonely Aurora, after her doctor discloses her real age at her birthday celebration, overcomes her repression and begins a whirlwind romance with her next-door neighbor, retired astronaut Garrett Breedlove, who is promiscuous and coarse. Simultaneously Emma and Sam strike up a friendship and quickly an affair as Sam&#x27;s wife refuses to have sex with him, and she suspects Flap of infidelity.

Over the course of the next few years, the marriage begins to fray. Emma catches Flap flirting with one of his students on campus, so drives back to Houston immediately. There, Garrett develops cold feet about his relationship with Aurora after seeing her with her daughter and grandkids and breaks it off. 

While Emma is gone, Flap accepts a promotion in Nebraska; she and the children return to Iowa, then they move to Nebraska. While on the campus, Emma sees the same young woman who she had seen Flap with in Iowa. Confronting her, she finds out he moved them to Nebraska so he could work with his girlfriend Janice. 

When Emma is diagnosed with cancer, before she knows how advanced it is, her lifelong friend Patsy convinces her to explore NYC. She is there a short time when Patsy&#x27;s friends there first find it strange she has never worked then it gets more uncomfortable when they hear about the cancer. Not enjoying herself, she returns home early.
When they discover it is terminal cancer, Aurora and Flap stay by Emma&#x27;s side through her treatment and hospitalization. Garrett flies to Nebraska to be with Aurora and her family. The dying Emma shows her love for her mother by entrusting her children to Aurora&#x27;s care.

The newly formed family, Aurora and the kids with Garrett, live together in Houston.

==Cast==
==Production==
James L. Brooks wrote the supporting role of Garrett Breedlove for Burt Reynolds, who turned down the role because of a verbal commitment he had made to appear in &quot;Stroker Ace&quot;. &quot;There are no awards in Hollywood for being an idiot&quot;, Reynolds later said of the decision. Harrison Ford and Paul Newman also turned down the role.

The exterior shots of Aurora Greenway&#x27;s home were filmed at 3060 Locke Lane, Houston, Texas. The exterior shots of locations intended to be in Des Moines, Iowa and Kearney, Nebraska were instead filmed in Lincoln, Nebraska. Many scenes were filmed on, or near, the campus of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. While filming in Lincoln, the state capital, Winger met then-governor of Nebraska Bob Kerrey; the two wound up dating for two years.

Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger reportedly did not get along with each other during production. MacLaine confirmed in an interview that &quot;it was a very tough shoot ... Chaotic...(Jim) likes working with tension on the set.&quot;

On working with Jack Nicholson, MacLaine said, &quot;Working with Jack Nicholson was crazy&quot;, but that his spontaneity may have contributed to her performance. She also said,We&#x27;re like old smoothies working together. You know the old smoothies they used to show whenever you went to the Ice Follies. They would have this elderly man and woman – who at that time were 40 – and they had a little bit too much weight around the waist and were moving a little slower. But they danced so elegantly and so in synch with each other that the audience just laid back and sort of sighed. That&#x27;s the way it is working with Jack. We both know what the other is going to do. And we don&#x27;t socialize, or anything. It&#x27;s an amazing chemistry – a wonderful, wonderful feeling.

MacLaine also confirmed in an interview with &quot;USA Today&quot; that Nicholson improvised when he put his hand down her dress in the beach scene.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; was commercially successful at the box office. On its opening weekend, it grossed $3.4 million, ranking number two at the US box office, until its second weekend, when it grossed $3.1 million, ranking number one at the box office. Three weekends later, it arrived number one again, with $9,000,000, having wide release. For four weekends, it remained number one at the box office, and it slipped to number two on its tenth weekend. On the film&#x27;s 11th weekend, it arrived number one (for the sixth and final time), grossing $3 million. The film grossed $108,423,489 in the United States and Canada and $165 million worldwide.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; received critical acclaim at the time of its release. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 82% approval rating based on 109 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.9/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;A classic tearjerker, &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; isn&#x27;t shy about reaching for the heartstrings – but is so well-acted and smartly scripted that it&#x27;s almost impossible to resist.&quot; Metacritic reports a score of 79 out of 100 based on reviews from ten critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film a four-out-of-four star rating, calling it &quot;a wonderful film&quot; and stating, &quot;There isn&#x27;t a thing that I would change, and I was exhilarated by the freedom it gives itself to move from the high comedy of Nicholson&#x27;s best moments to the acting of Debra Winger in the closing scenes.&quot; Gene Siskel, who also gave the film a highly enthusiastic review, correctly predicted upon its release that it would go on to win the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1983.

In his movie guide, Leonard Maltin awarded the film a rare four-star rating, calling it a &quot;Wonderful mix of humor and heartache,&quot; and concluded the film was &quot;Consistently offbeat and unpredictable, with exceptional performances by all three stars.&quot;

==Accolades==
As of July 2022, Nicholson is one of the few supporting actors to ever sweep &quot;The Big Four&quot; critics awards (Los Angeles Film Critics Association, National Board of Review, New York Film Critics Circle, National Society of Film Critics) for his performance of Garrett Breedlove.

<doc id="113436" wikidata="Q620731" url="?curid=113436" title="The Dresser (1983 film)">
<text>The Dresser is a 1983 British drama film directed by Peter Yates and adapted by Ronald Harwood from his 1980 play &quot;The Dresser&quot;. It tells the story of an aging actor&#x27;s personal assistant struggling to keep his employer&#x27;s life together. The film stars Albert Finney, Tom Courtenay, Zena Walker, Eileen Atkins, Edward Fox and Michael Gough. 

Finney and Courtenay were both nominated for Academy Awards, BAFTA Awards, and Golden Globe Awards for their performances, with Courtenay winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama in a tie with Robert Duvall for &quot;Tender Mercies.&quot;

==Plot==
The plot is based on Harwood&#x27;s experiences as dresser to English Shakespearean actor-manager Sir Donald Wolfit, who is the model for the character &quot;Sir&quot;.

The film opens with a performance of &quot;Othello&quot; at a regional theatre in Britain during World War II. In the title role is an aging, once-famous Shakespearean actor identified to us only as &quot;Sir&quot;. He is of the old, bombastic school of British acting, full of grand gestures and fine oratory. As the curtain comes down on the last act, and as the actors line up for their curtain call, Sir lectures them on the mistakes they&#x27;ve made during the performance, showing us that he is the leader of this travelling band of actors bringing Shakespeare to the provinces during wartime.

Waiting backstage is Norman, who has been Sir&#x27;s dresser for decades. Norman is an efficient, somewhat effeminate man who knows Sir&#x27;s every whim and fancy, is used to his tirades and temperamental rants and is, for all intents and purposes, Sir&#x27;s servant. As Norman waits for Sir to come offstage after a typically florid closing address to the audience, we see one way he copes with his job as he takes a nip from a little bottle of brandy always in his back pocket.

The company is hurrying to its next venue, the industrial city of Bradford, where Sir is to give his renowned portrayal of the title character in &quot;King Lear&quot;. The train nearly leaves without them, as Sir makes his stately progress through York railway station to the platform, Norman scurrying ahead to plead with the train guard to hold the train for Sir&#x27;s arrival. But the train begins to pull out of the station, until Sir delivers a loud, commanding &quot;STOP...THAT...TRAIN!&quot; from the platform steps. The guard is taken aback, the train halts, and Sir placidly leads his company aboard.

Arriving in Bradford, however, another source of Norman&#x27;s anxiety soon becomes clear, for it becomes obvious that Sir&#x27;s mental capacities are rapidly fading. Norman rescues him from a confused, almost violent rant in Halifax town square near Piece Hall that lands Sir in hospital. As the company tries to decide what to do, Sir unexpectedly arrives at the theatre, disoriented and exhausted, saying he has discharged himself from hospital. Norman ushers Sir to the dressing room, fiercely resisting the stage manager&#x27;s insistence that the show be cancelled, and insisting Sir will be ready to go on.

The middle section of the film takes place nearly entirely in the dressing room, as Norman struggles to prepare Sir for the curtain. Sir&#x27;s wandering mind and nearly incoherent ramblings gradually become more focused as Norman gets him to concentrate on applying his makeup, remembering his lines; and we see how dependent the two men are on each other. Sir would have no career left without Norman; Norman, even worse, would have no life without Sir, to whom he has so long dedicated all his time and energy. By the time Sir&#x27;s wife, referred to only as &quot;Her Ladyship&quot;, who is playing Cordelia to her husband&#x27;s Lear, arrives in the dressing room for the five-minute call, Sir is ready for the role he has performed 227 times.

The curtain rises for the opening dialogue among Lear&#x27;s courtiers, but Sir seems to mentally drift away while waiting for his cue, much to Norman&#x27;s distress, forcing the hapless actors on stage to improvise speeches while Norman struggles to convince Sir of his entrance. Air raid sirens sound, signalling the onset of an air raid; and, indeed, distant bombs that can be heard falling seem to rouse Sir and he strides on stage to deliver what all agree is his finest portrayal of Lear in his long career.

After the triumphant performance, however, Sir collapses from exhaustion and Norman helps him to his dressing room to lie down. Sir requests that Norman read from an autobiography he claims to have been writing. Although all Sir has written is the opening dedication, Norman reads aloud Sir&#x27;s gracious &quot;thank you&quot;s to his audiences, his fellow actors, to Shakespeare, to stage technicians...but not a word about his dresser who has served him so long and loyally. About to protest, Norman discovers that Sir has died while he&#x27;s been reading. Norman, by now slightly drunk from the evening&#x27;s brandy nips, flies into a rage, accusing Sir of being a thankless old sod, and in his anger even madly scribbles an addition to Sir&#x27;s writing thanking himself. But Norman&#x27;s anger only temporarily covers his disorientation at losing the only life he has known for so many years and, as Norman tearfully admits, the only man he has ever loved. The film closes with Norman sprawled across Sir&#x27;s body, unwilling to let go of his life and his love.

==Cast==
==Productions==
Goldcrest Films gave Ronald Harwood $60,000 to write the screenplay. They invested £1.5 million in the film and made a profit of nearly £300,000. In 1990 Jake Eberts of Goldcrest called it &quot;the most pleasant production with which I have ever been associated.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;The Dresser&quot; received good reviews upon its release. Roger Ebert, of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, in awarding the film four out of four stars, described the film as &quot;a wonderful collection of theatrical lore, detail, and superstition...the best sort of drama, fascinating us on the surface with color and humor and esoteric detail, and then revealing the truth underneath.&quot; Joachim Boaz of &quot;Film Ruminations&quot; gave it 7 out 10 in 2010 and noted the film was &quot;solid, well-acted, if somewhat forgettable drama&quot;. John Simon of the &quot;National Review&quot; said &quot;The Dresser&quot; is one of those rare cases where the film version was better than the stage original.

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 100% of 15 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 8.0/10.

===Box office===
Goldcrest Films invested £1,456,000 in the film and received £1,744,000 in return making a profit of £288,000.

===Awards and nominations===
==TV film==
In 2015, the BBC produced a variant TV adaptation of the play, starring Anthony Hopkins, Ian McKellen and Emily Watson. It received positive reviews.

==Popular culture==
A vocal sample of Albert Finney uttering &quot;227 &quot;Lears&quot; and I can&#x27;t remember the first line&quot; in &quot;The Dresser&quot; can be heard at the end of &quot;P.C.P.&quot;, the closing song of the Manic Street Preachers&#x27; album &quot;The Holy Bible&quot; (1994).

<doc id="113441" wikidata="Q1054905" url="?curid=113441" title="Morgan State University">
<text>Morgan State University (Morgan State or MSU) is a public historically black research university in Baltimore, Maryland. It is the largest of Maryland&#x27;s historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). In 1890, the university, then known as the Centenary Biblical Institute, changed its name to honor Lyttleton Morgan, the first chairman of its board of trustees and a donor. It became a university in 1975.

Although a public institution, Morgan State is not a part of the University System of Maryland. It is a member of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. It is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. and classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

==History==
Morgan State University (MSU) is a historically black college in Baltimore, Maryland. It was founded in 1867 as the Centenary Biblical Institute, a Methodist Episcopal seminary, to train young men in the ministry. At the time of his death, Thomas Kelso, co-founder and president of the board of directors, endowed the Male Free School and Colored Institute through a legacy of his estate.

It later broadened its mission to educate both men and women as teachers. The school was renamed as Morgan College in 1890 in honor of the Reverend Lyttleton Morgan, the first chairman of its board of trustees, who donated land to the college. In 1895, the institution awarded its first baccalaureate degree to George W. F. McMechen, after whom the building of the school of business and management is named today. McMechen later earned a law degree from Yale University and, after establishing his career, became one of Morgan&#x27;s main financial supporters.

John O. Spencer became the fifth president of Morgan College in 1902, and served in that position until 1937. In 1902, Morgan&#x27;s assets were a little over $100,000 in grounds, equipment and endowments, including its branch schools at the time; the then Princess Anne Academy and the Virginia Collegiate and Industrial Institute. During his tenure as president, the university saw major expansions across the campus. By 1937, the school&#x27;s assets were more than $1,000,000 and its enrollment had grown from 150 to 487. It also saw the first &quot;Era of Progress&quot; as the college transformed from a college supported by the religious community (which focused primarily upon training young men and women for the ministry) to a college gaining support from private foundations, and offering liberal arts academic degree for a variety of professions. In 1915, Andrew Carnegie donated to the school a grant of $50,000 for a central academic building. The terms of the grant included the purchase of a new site for the College, payment of all outstanding obligations, and the construction of a building to be named after him. The College met the conditions and moved to its present site in northeast Baltimore in 1917.

In 1918, the white community of Lauraville tried to have the sale revoked by filing suit in the circuit court in Towson, upset that the Ivy Mill property, the planned location of Morgan State, had been sold to a &quot;negro&quot; college. The circuit court dismissed the suit, which the community appealed to the Maryland Court of Appeals. The appellate court upheld the lower court decision, finding no basis that siting the college at this location would constitute a public nuisance. Despite some ugly threats and several demonstrations against the project, Morgan College was constructed at the new site and later expanded. Carnegie Hall, the oldest original building on the present Morgan campus, was erected a year later.

Morgan remained a private institution until 1939. That year, the state of Maryland purchased the school. Morgan College became Morgan State College. In 1975, Morgan State added several doctoral programs and was designated as a university by state legislature.

===21st century ===
In the 21st century, the university has seen the construction of a new student union, two dedicated parking garages, the Earl S. Richardson Library, the Dixon Research Center, the Communications Building, and the Center for the Built Environment and Infrastructure Studies.

The Carl J. Murphy Fine Arts Center is also the home of the James E. Lewis Museum of Art. In September 2012, Morgan State opened the Center for the Built Environment and Infrastructure Studies (CBEIS) which houses the School of Architecture and Planning, School of Transportation Studies, and the School of Engineering.

In 2020, MacKenzie Scott donated $40 million, the largest in Morgan State&#x27;s history and one of the largest ever to a HBCU. The following year, Calvin E. Tyler Jr. donated $20 million to endow scholarships.

==Academics==
Morgan State awards baccalaureate, master&#x27;s, and doctorate degrees. 

Morgan has educated over 100 Fulbright scholars, the most of any HBCU. Morgan is also first among HBCUs in the number of Fulbright-related grants awarded to students, faculty, and administrators. It is one of the 19 schools included on the inaugural Fulbright HBCU Institutional Leaders list. Since instituting the Fulbright program, Morgan State University has trained 144 Fulbright awardees initiating international studies in 43 different countries. Moreover, 51 MSU professors or administrators (none of whom were Morgan graduates) have earned 73 &quot;Senior Fulbright&quot; awards to 42 countries.

==Student life==

===Athletics===
Morgan&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Bears, and they compete in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC).
Between 1926 and 1928, a young Charles Drew served as Athletic Director. During this time he made great improvements in the school&#x27;s teams&#x27; records. From the 1930s through 1960s, led by coach and then athletic director Edward P. Hurt, Morgan&#x27;s athletic teams were legendary. More than thirty of its football players were drafted by and played in the NFL and many of its track athletes competed internationally and received world-class status. By the late 1960s most white colleges and universities ended their segregation against black high school students and many top black high school students and athletes started matriculating to schools from which they had previously been barred. While achieving a national goal of desegregation, integration depleted the athletic strength of schools like Morgan State and Grambling State University. For example, the annual contest between Morgan State and Grambling played in New York City in the late 1960s drew more than 60,000 fans. Morgan State&#x27;s rivals are the Howard University Bison (the matchup is often called the &quot;Battle of the Beltway&quot;) and the Coppin State Eagles.

====Basketball====

In 2009, the Morgan State men&#x27;s basketball team won the MEAC regular season and tournament championship and qualified for the 2009 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament. In their first tournament appearance, the 15th-seeded Bears lost to the 2008–09 Oklahoma Sooners men&#x27;s basketball team Oklahoma Sooners, 82–54, in the first round of the South Regional.

In 2010 the Morgan State men&#x27;s basketball team again won the MEAC regular season and tournament championship and qualified for the 2010 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament, again as a 15 seed. Morgan State lost to West Virginia University in the first round by a score of 77–50.

====Football====

Morgan State began playing football in 1898, 31 years after the school was founded. The Bears have won three MEAC Championships (1976, 1979 and 2014). Their last Division I-AA/FCS playoffs appearance was in 2014. Fifty three former Morgan players have gone on to play professional football. Former Morgan Bears Len Ford, Leroy Kelly, Willie Lanier and Rosey Brown are members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.

====Lacrosse====

By 1975 Morgan State became noted for its lacrosse team. Morgan State was the first—and, until the turn of the 21st century, the only—historically black university to field a lacrosse team.

In 2005 students organized a lacrosse club which plays other college&#x27;s lacrosse clubs, but the team has yet to qualify to become an NCAA-sanctioned team.

====Wrestling====
In 2023, Morgan State revived its wrestling program, which was cut in 1997 due to budget restraints. Kenny Monday was hired as head coach.

====Athletic Hall of Fame====

More than two hundred men and women Morgan State athletes have been inducted into the Morgan State University Hall of Fame including National Football League Hall of Famers Rosey Brown, Leroy Kelly and Willie Lanier, two-time Olympic Gold medalist George Rhoden, and the coach of the Ten Bears lacrosse team Howard &quot;Chip&quot; Silverman.

During 2011-2012 academic years, the choir had several prominent performances. Since 2017, the Morgan State University choir has toured, Cuba, Spain, Portugal, Austria, Slovakia, Germany, England, Scotland, Wales, Peru, Ecuador, and Galapagos Islands.

The film stars Sam Shepard, Ed Harris, Scott Glenn, Fred Ward, Dennis Quaid, and Barbara Hershey; Levon Helm narrates and plays Air Force test pilot Jack Ridley.

&quot;The Right Stuff&quot; was a box-office bomb, grossing about $21 million (domestically) against a $27 million budget. Despite this, it received widespread critical acclaim, and was nominated for eight Oscars at the 56th Academy Awards, four of which it won. The film was a huge success on the home video market. In 2013, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film was ranked #19 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s most inspiring movies.

The film was later expanded into its titular franchise, including a television series and a documentary film.

==Plot==

In 1947, over the Muroc Army Air Field in California, a number of test pilots are killed while flying high-speed aircraft such as the rocket-powered Bell X-1. After another pilot, Slick Goodlin, demands $150,000 () to attempt to break the sound barrier, war hero Captain Chuck Yeager receives the chance to fly the X-1. Yeager becomes the first person to fly at supersonic speed, defeating the &quot;demon in the sky&quot;.

Six years later, Muroc, now Edwards Air Force Base, still attracts the best test pilots. Yeager (now a major) and friendly rival Scott Crossfield repeatedly break one another&#x27;s speed records. They often visit the Happy Bottom Riding Club run by Pancho Barnes, who classifies the pilots at Edwards as either &quot;prime&quot; (such as Yeager and Crossfield) that fly the best equipment or newer &quot;pudknockers&quot; who only dream about it. Gordon &quot;Gordo&quot; Cooper, Virgil &quot;Gus&quot; Grissom and Donald &quot;Deke&quot; Slayton, captains of the United States Air Force, are among the &quot;pudknockers&quot; who hope to also prove that they have &quot;the Right Stuff&quot;. The tests are no longer secret, as the military soon recognizes that it needs good publicity for funding. Cooper&#x27;s wife, Trudy, and other wives are afraid of becoming widows, but cannot change their husbands&#x27; ambitions and desire for success and fame.

In 1957, the launch of the Soviet Sputnik satellite alarms the United States government. Politicians such as Senator Lyndon B. Johnson and military leaders demand that NASA help America defeat the Soviets in the new Space Race. The search for the first Americans in space excludes Yeager because he lacks a college degree. Grueling physical and mental tests select the Mercury Seven astronauts, including John Glenn of the United States Marine Corps, Alan Shepard, Walter Schirra and Scott Carpenter of the United States Navy, as well as Cooper, Grissom and Slayton; they immediately become national heroes. Although many early NASA rockets explode during launch, the ambitious astronauts all hope to be the first in space as part of Project Mercury. Although engineers see the men as passengers, the pilots insist that the Mercury spacecraft have a window, a hatch with explosive bolts, and pitch-yaw-roll controls. However, the Soviet Union beats them into space on April 12, 1961, with the launch of Vostok 1 carrying Yuri Gagarin. The seven astronauts are determined to match and surpass the Soviets.

Shepard is the first American to reach space on the 15-minute sub-orbital flight of Mercury-Redstone 3 on May 5. After Grissom&#x27;s similar flight of Mercury-Redstone 4 on July 21, the capsule&#x27;s hatch blows open and quickly fills with water. Grissom escapes, but the spacecraft, overweight with seawater, sinks. Many criticize Grissom for possibly panicking and opening the hatch prematurely. Glenn becomes the first American to orbit the Earth on Mercury-Atlas 6 on February 20, 1962, surviving a possibly loose heat shield, and receives a ticker-tape parade. He, his colleagues, and their families become celebrities, including a gigantic celebration in the Sam Houston Coliseum to announce the opening of the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, despite Glenn&#x27;s wife Annie&#x27;s fear of public speaking due to a stutter.

Although test pilots at Edwards mock the Mercury program for sending &quot;spam in a can&quot; into space, they recognize that they are no longer the fastest men on Earth, and Yeager states that &quot;it takes a special kind of man to volunteer for a suicide mission, especially when it&#x27;s on national TV.&quot; While testing the new Lockheed NF-104A, Yeager attempts to set a new altitude record at the edge of space but is nearly killed in a high-speed ejection when his engine fails. Though seriously burned after reaching the ground, Yeager gathers up his parachute and walks to the ambulance, proving his worth.

On May 15, 1963, Cooper has a successful launch on Mercury-Atlas 9, ending the Mercury program. As the last American to fly into space alone, he &quot;went higher, farther, and faster than any other American ... for a brief moment, Gordo Cooper became the greatest pilot anyone had ever seen.&quot;

==Production==
===Development===
In 1979, independent producers Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler outbid Universal Pictures for the movie rights to Tom Wolfe&#x27;s book, paying $350,000. They hired William Goldman to write the screenplay. Goldman wrote in his memoirs that his adaptation focused on the astronauts, entirely ignoring Chuck Yeager. Goldman was inspired to accept the job because he wanted to say something patriotic about America in the wake of the Iran hostage crisis. Winkler writes in his memoirs that he was disappointed that Goldman&#x27;s adaptation ignored Yeager.

In June 1980, United Artists agreed to finance the film up to $20 million, and the producers began looking for a director. Michael Ritchie was originally attached but fell through; so did John Avildsen who, four years prior, had won an Oscar for his work under Winkler and Chartoff on the original &quot;Rocky&quot;. (&quot;The Right Stuff&quot; would have reunited Avildsen with both producers, and also with a fourth &quot;Rocky&quot; veteran, composer Bill Conti.)

Ultimately, Chartoff and Winkler approached director Philip Kaufman, who agreed to make the film, but did not like Goldman&#x27;s script; Kaufman disliked the emphasis on patriotism, and wanted Yeager put back in the film. Eventually, Goldman quit the project in August 1980, and United Artists pulled out.

When Wolfe showed no interest in adapting his own book, Kaufman wrote a draft in eight weeks. His draft restored Yeager to the story, because &quot;if you&#x27;re tracing how the future began, the future in space travel, it began really with Yeager and the world of the test pilots. The astronauts descended from them.&quot;

After the financial failure of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, the studio put &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; in turnaround. Then The Ladd Company stepped in with an estimated $17 million.

===Casting===
Actor Ed Harris auditioned twice in 1981 for the role of John Glenn. Originally, Kaufman wanted to use a troupe of contortionists to portray the press corps, but settled on the improvisational comedy troupe Fratelli Bologna, known for its sponsorship of &quot;St. Stupid&#x27;s Day&quot; in San Francisco. The director created a locust-like chatter to accompany the press corps whenever they appear, which was achieved through a sound combination of (among other things) motorized Nikon cameras and clicking beetles.

Professional American football player Anthony Muñoz has a minor role in the film as a hospital orderly named Gonzales; the soft-spoken Muñoz was asked to lip sync his lines, and a &quot;deeper, gruffer voice&quot; was dubbed over him in post-production.

===Filming===
Most of the film was shot in and around San Francisco between March and October 1982, with additional filming continuing into January 1983. A waterfront warehouse there was transformed into a studio. Location shooting took place primarily at the abandoned Hamilton Air Force Base north of San Francisco which was converted into a sound stage for the numerous interior sets. No location could substitute for the distinctive Edwards Air Force Base landscape, so the entire production crew moved to the Mojave Desert to shoot the opening sequences that framed the story of the test pilots at Muroc Army Air Field, later Edwards AFB. Additional shooting took place in California City in early 1983. During the filming of a sequence portraying Chuck Yeager&#x27;s ejection from an NF-104, stuntman Joseph Svec, a former Green Beret, was killed when he failed to open his parachute because he may have been unconscious from smoke.

In 1982, the scene of the wives of the astronauts watching the television broadcast was filmed on military housing in Novato, California.

Yeager was hired as a technical consultant on the film. He took the actors flying, studied the storyboards and special effects, and pointed out the errors. To prepare for their roles, Kaufman gave the actors playing the seven astronauts an extensive videotape collection to study.

The effort to make an authentic feature led to the use of many full-size aircraft, scale models and special effects to replicate the scenes at Edwards Air Force Base and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Special visual effects supervisor Gary Gutierrez said the first special effects were too clean for the desired &quot;dirty, funky, early NASA look.&quot; So Gutierrez and his team started from scratch, employing unconventional techniques, like going up a hill with model airplanes on wires and fog machines to create clouds, or shooting model F-104s from a crossbow device and capturing their flight with up to four cameras. Avant garde filmmaker Jordan Belson created the background of the Earth as seen from high-flying planes and from orbiting spacecraft.

Kaufman gave his five editors a list of documentary images he needed, sending them off to search for film from NASA, the Air Force and Bell Aircraft vaults. They also discovered Russian stock footage not viewed in 30 years. During production, Kaufman met with resistance from the Ladd Company and threatened to quit several times. In December 1982, one reel of cut workprint of the film that included portions of John Glenn&#x27;s flight disappeared from Kaufman&#x27;s editing facility in San Francisco&#x27;s Dogpatch neighborhood. The missing reel of cut workprint was never found, but was reconstructed using a black and white duplicate copy of the reel as a guide and reprinting new workprint from the original negative, which was always safely in storage at the film lab.

===Historical accuracy===
Although &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; was based on historic events and real people, some substantial dramatic liberties were taken. Neither Yeager&#x27;s flight in the X-1 to break the sound barrier early in the film or his later, nearly fatal flight in the NF-104A were spur-of-moment, capriciously decided events, as the film seems to imply – they actually were part of the routine testing program for both aircraft. Yeager had already test-flown both aircraft a number of times previously and was very familiar with them.
Jack Ridley had actually died in 1957, even though his character appears in several key scenes taking place after that, most notably including Yeager&#x27;s 1963 flight of the NF-104A.

&quot;The Right Stuff&quot; depicts Cooper arriving at Edwards in 1953, reminiscing with Grissom there about the two of them having supposedly flown together at the Langley Air Force Base and then hanging out with Grissom and Slayton, including all three supposedly being present at Edwards when Scott Crossfield flew at Mach 2 in November 1953. The film shows the three of them being recruited together there for the astronaut program in late 1957, with Grissom supposedly expressing keen interest in becoming a &quot;star-voyager&quot;. According to their respective NASA biographies, none of the three was posted to Edwards before 1955 (Slayton in 1955 and Grissom and Cooper in 1956,) and neither of the latter two had previously trained at Langley. By the time astronaut recruitment began in late 1957 after the Soviets had orbited Sputnik, Grissom had already left Edwards and returned to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, where he had served previously and was happy with his new assignment there. Grissom did not even know he was under consideration for the astronaut program until he received mysterious orders &quot;out of the blue&quot; to report to Washington in civilian clothing for what turned out to be a recruitment session for NASA. 

While the film took liberties with certain historical facts as part of &quot;dramatic license&quot;, criticism focused on one: the portrayal of Gus Grissom panicking when his &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; spacecraft sank following splashdown. Most historians, as well as engineers working for or with NASA and many of the related contractor agencies within the aerospace industry, are now convinced that the premature detonation of the spacecraft hatch&#x27;s explosive bolts was caused by mechanical failure not associated with direct human error or deliberate detonation by Grissom. This determination had been made long before the film was completed. Many astronauts, including Schirra, Cooper and Shepard, were critical of &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; for its treatment of Grissom, who was killed in the Apollo 1 launch pad fire in January 1967 and thus unable to defend himself when the film was being made.

Other notable inaccuracies include: early termination of Glenn&#x27;s flight after three orbits instead of seven (in reality, the flight was scheduled for at most three orbits); the engineers who built the Mercury craft are portrayed as Germans (in reality, they were mostly Americans).

===Film models===
A large number of film models were assembled for the production; for the more than 80 aircraft appearing in the film, static mock-ups and models were used as well as authentic aircraft of the period. Lieutenant Colonel Duncan Wilmore, USAF (Ret) acted as the United States Air Force liaison to the production, beginning his role as a technical consultant in 1980 when the pre-production planning had begun. The first draft of the script in 1980 had concentrated only on the Mercury 7, but as subsequent revisions developed the treatment into more of the original story that Wolfe had envisioned, the aircraft of the late-1940s that would have been seen at Edwards AFB were required. Wilmore gathered World War II era &quot;prop&quot; aircraft including:
* Douglas A-26 Invader
* North American P-51 Mustang
* North American T-6 Texan and
* Boeing B-29 Superfortress

The first group were mainly &quot;set dressing&quot; on the ramp while the Confederate Air Force (now renamed the Commemorative Air Force) B-29 &quot;Fifi&quot; was modified to act as the B-29 &quot;mothership&quot; to carry the Bell X-1 and X-1A rocket-powered record-breakers.

Other &quot;real&quot; aircraft included the early jet fighters and trainers as well as current USAF and United States Navy examples. These flying aircraft and helicopters included:
* Douglas A-4 Skyhawk
* LTV A-7 Corsair II
* North American F-86 Sabre
* Convair F-106 Delta Dart
* McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II
* Sikorsky H-34 Choctaw
* Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King
* Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star
* Northrop T-38 Talon

A number of aircraft significant to the story had to be recreated. The first was an essentially static X-1 that had to at least roll along the ground and realistically &quot;belch flame&quot; by a simulated rocket blast from the exhaust pipes. A series of wooden mock-up X-1s were used to depict interior shots of the cockpit, the mating up of the X-1 to a modified B-29 fuselage and bomb bay and ultimately to recreate flight in a combination of model work and live-action photography. The &quot;follow-up&quot; X-1A was also an all-wooden model.

The U.S. Navy&#x27;s Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket that Crossfield duelled with Yeager&#x27;s X-1 and X-1A was recreated from a modified Hawker Hunter jet fighter. The climactic flight of Yeager in a Lockheed NF-104A was originally to be made with a modified Lockheed F-104 Starfighter but ultimately, Wilmore decided that the production had to make do with a repainted Luftwaffe F-104G, which lacks the rocket engine of the NF-104.

Wooden mock-ups of the Mercury space capsules also realistically depicted the NASA spacecraft and were built from the original mold.

For many of the flying sequences, scale models were produced by USFX Studios and filmed outdoors in natural sunlight against the sky. Even off-the-shelf plastic scale models were utilized for aerial scenes. The X-1, F-104 and B-29 models were built in large numbers as a number of the more than 40 scale models were destroyed in the process of filming. The blending together of miniatures, full-scale mock-ups and actual aircraft was seamlessly integrated into the live-action footage. The addition of original newsreel footage was used sparingly but to effect to provide another layer of authenticity.

==Reception and legacy==
===Box office===
&quot;The Right Stuff&quot; had its world premiere on October 16, 1983, at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., to benefit the American Film Institute. It was given a limited release on October 21, 1983, in 229 theaters, grossing a disappointing $1.6 million on its opening weekend. It went into wide release on February 17, 1984, in 627 theaters where it grossed an additional $1.6 million on that weekend. The movie only went on to gross $21.1 million in the United States and Canada. The failure of this and &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot; caused The Ladd Company to shut down.

As part of the promotion for the film, Veronica Cartwright, Chuck Yeager, Gordon Cooper, Scott Glenn and Dennis Quaid appeared in 1983 at ConStellation, the 41st World Science Fiction Convention in Baltimore.

===Reviews===
&quot;The Right Stuff&quot; received overwhelming acclaim from critics. The film holds a 96% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 52 reviews, with an average score of 8.80/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;The Right Stuff&quot; packs a lot of movie into its hefty running time, spinning a colorful, fact-based story out of consistently engaging characters in the midst of epochal events.&quot; On Metacritic — which assigns a weighted mean score — the film has a score of 91 out of 100 based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Roger Ebert named &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; best film of 1983, writing: &quot;There was a lot going on, and there&#x27;s a lot going on in the movie, too.&quot;The Right Stuff&quot; is an adventure film, a special effects film, a social commentary and a satire... it joins a short list of recent American movies that might be called experimental epics: movies that have an ambitious reach through time and subject matter, that spend freely for locations or special effects, but that consider each scene as intently as an art film... It&#x27;s a great film.&quot; He later named it one of the best films of the decade, and wrote: &quot;&quot;The Right Stuff&quot; is a greater film because it is not a straightforward historical account but pulls back to chronicle the transition from Yeager and other test pilots to a mighty public relations enterprise&quot;. He later put it at #2 on his 10 best of the 1980s, behind Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Raging Bull.&quot;

Gene Siskel, Ebert&#x27;s co-host of &quot;At the Movies&quot;, also named &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; the best film of 1983, and said: &quot;It&#x27;s a great film, and I hope everyone sees it.&quot; Siskel also went on to include &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; at #3 on his list of the best films of the 1980s, behind &quot;Shoah&quot; and &quot;Raging Bull&quot;.

In his review for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, David Ansen wrote: &quot;When &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; takes to the skies, it can&#x27;t be compared with any other movie, old or new: it&#x27;s simply the most thrilling flight footage ever put on film&quot;. Gary Arnold in his review for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, wrote: &quot;The movie is obviously so solid and appealing that it&#x27;s bound to go through the roof commercially and keep on soaring for the next year or so&quot;. In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby praised Shepard&#x27;s performance: &quot;Both as the character he plays and as an iconic screen presence, Mr. Shepard gives the film much well-needed heft. He is the center of gravity&quot;.

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot;, and stated: &quot;It is the film&#x27;s willingness to question [...] idealism, while laying down some very fine footage of things that are moving &quot;very&quot; fast, which makes &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; thoroughly absorbing for nearly three and a quarter hours.&quot;

Tom Wolfe made no secret of his dislike for the film, especially because of changes from his original book. William Goldman also disliked the choices made by Kaufman, writing in his 1983 book &quot;Adventures in the Screen Trade&quot;: &quot;Phil [Kaufman]&#x27;s heart was with Yeager. And not only that, he felt the astronauts, rather than being heroic, were really minor leaguers, mechanical men of no particular quality, not great pilots at all, simply the product of hype.&quot;

The Mercury Seven astronauts were mostly negative about the film. In an early interview, Deke Slayton said that none of the film &quot;was all that accurate, but it was well done.&quot; However, in his memoirs, Slayton described the film as being &quot;as bad as the book was good, just a joke&quot;. Wally Schirra liked the book a lot, but expressed disappointment and dislike for the movie, and he never forgave the producers for portraying Gus Grissom as a &quot;bungling sort of coward&quot;, which was totally untrue. In an interview, Schirra said: &quot;It was the best book on space, but the movie was distorted and warped... All the astronauts hated [the movie]. We called
it &quot;Animal House in Space&quot;.&quot; In another interview, Schirra said: &quot;They insulted the lovely people who talked us through the program - the NASA engineers. They made them like bumbling Germans&quot;. Scott Carpenter said that it was a &quot;great movie in all regards&quot;. Alan Shepard harshly criticized both the movie and the book: &quot;Neither Tom Wolfe nor [Philip Kaufman] had talked to any of the original seven guys, at any time... &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; [both the film and the book] is fiction... The movie assumed that Grissom had panicked, which wasn&#x27;t true at all. The movie made him look like a bad guy for the whole movie. They were very hard on John Glenn&#x27;s wife, who had a mild speech problem. They made Lyndon Johnson look like a clown. It was just totally fiction.&quot;

Chuck Yeager said of his characterization: &quot;Sam [Shepard] is not a real flamboyant actor, and I&#x27;m not a real flamboyant-type individual ... he played his role the way I fly airplanes&quot;.

Robert Osborne, who introduced showings of the film on Turner Classic Movies, was quite enthusiastic about the film. The cameo appearance by the real Chuck Yeager in the film was a particular &quot;treat&quot;, which Osborne cited. The recounting of many of the legendary aspects of Yeager&#x27;s life was left in place, including the naming of the X-1, &quot;Glamorous Glennis&quot; after his wife and his superstitious preflight ritual of asking for a stick of Beemans chewing gum from his best friend, Jack Ridley.

<text>William Hickling Prescott (May 4, 1796 – January 28, 1859) was an American historian and Hispanist, who is widely recognized by historiographers to have been the first American scientific historian. Despite having serious visual impairment, which at times prevented him from reading or writing for himself, Prescott became one of the most eminent historians of 19th century America. He is also noted for his eidetic memory, also called &quot;photographic memory&quot;.

After an extensive period of study, during which he sporadically contributed to academic journals, Prescott specialized in late Renaissance Spain and the early Spanish Empire. His works on the subject, &quot;The History of the Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella the Catholic&quot; (1837), &quot;The History of the Conquest of Mexico&quot; (1843), &quot;A History of the Conquest of Peru&quot; (1847) and the unfinished &quot;History of the Reign of Phillip II&quot; (1856–1858) have become classic works in the field, and have had a great impact on the study of both Spain and Mesoamerica. During his lifetime, he was upheld as one of the greatest living American intellectuals, and knew personally many of the leading political figures of the day, in both the United States and Britain. Prescott has become one of the most widely translated American historians, and was an important figure in the development of history as a rigorous academic discipline.

Historians admire Prescott for his exhaustive, careful, and systematic use of archives, his accurate recreation of sequences of events, his balanced judgments and his lively writing style. He was primarily focused on political and military affairs, largely ignoring economic, social, intellectual, and cultural forces that in recent decades historians have focused on. Instead, he wrote narrative history, subsuming unstated causal forces in his driving storyline.

== Early life ==

William H. Prescott was born in Salem, Massachusetts, on May 4, 1796, the first of seven children, although four of his siblings died in infancy. His parents were William Prescott Jr., a lawyer, and his wife, née Catherine Greene Hickling. His grandfather William Prescott served as a colonel during the American Revolutionary War.

Prescott began formal schooling at the age of seven, studying under Mr. Jacob Knapp. The family moved to Boston, Massachusetts, in 1808, where his father&#x27;s earnings substantially increased. His studies continued under Dr. John Gardiner, rector of Trinity Episcopal Church. As a young man, Prescott frequented the Boston Athenæum, which at the time held the 10,000-volume private library of John Quincy Adams, who was on a diplomatic mission to Russia. In 1832, Prescott became a trustee of the library, a position he held for 15 years.

Prescott enrolled at Harvard College as a second year student (sophomore) in August 1811, at the age of 15. He was not considered academically distinguished, despite showing promise in Latin and Greek. Prescott found mathematics particularly difficult, and resorted to memorizing mathematical demonstrations word-for-word, which he could do with relative ease, in order to hide his ignorance of the subject. Prescott&#x27;s eyesight degenerated after being hit in the eye with a crust of bread during a food fight as a student, and it remained weak and unstable throughout the rest of his life. Prescott was admitted to Phi Beta Kappa society as a senior, which he considered a great personal honor, and graduated from Harvard in 1814. After a short period of rheumatic illness, he embarked on an extended tour of Europe.

Prescott first traveled to the island of São Miguel in the Azores, where his grandfather and Portuguese grandmother lived. After two weeks, he left for the cooler climate of London, where he stayed with the distinguished surgeon Astley Cooper and the oculist William Adams. Prescott first used a noctograph while staying with Adams; the tool became a permanent feature of his life, allowing him to write independently in spite of his impaired eyesight. He visited Hampton Court Palace with future American president John Quincy Adams, at the time a diplomat in London, where they saw the Raphael Cartoons. In August 1816, Prescott traveled to Paris, but later moved on to Italy, where he spent the winter. He returned to Paris in early 1817, where he chanced to meet the American Hispanist George Ticknor, and made another visit to England. Prescott spent some time in Cambridge, where he saw the manuscripts of Isaac Newton&#x27;s works, and returned to the United States in the same year. Prescott&#x27;s first academic work, an essay submitted anonymously, was rejected by the &quot;North American Review&quot; in late 1817. After a short period of courtship, he married Susan Amory, the daughter of Thomas Coffin Amory and Hannah Rowe Linzee, on May 4, 1820.

== Career ==
=== Early career: The &quot;History of Ferdinand and Isabella&quot; ===
In 1821, Prescott abandoned the idea of a legal career because of the continued deterioration of his eyesight, and resolved to devote himself to literature. Although he initially studied a wide range of subjects, including Italian, French, English and Spanish literature, American history, classics and political philosophy, Prescott came to focus on Italian poetry. Among the works he studied during this period were such classics as Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; and Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot;. His first published works were two essays in the &quot;North American Review&quot;—both discussing Italian poetry. The first of these, published in 1824, was titled &quot;Italian Narrative Poetry&quot;, and became somewhat controversial after it was heavily criticized in an Italian review by Lorenzo Da Ponte, the librettist of Mozart&#x27;s Don Giovanni. Prescott wrote a succinct reply to Da Ponte&#x27;s fifty-page argument in the &quot;North American Review&quot; of July 1825. Da Ponte published the criticisms as an appendix to his translation of Dodley&#x27;s &quot;Economy of Human life&quot;, which resulted in Prescott noticing them rather late.

Prescott first became interested in the history of Spain after his friend, the Harvard professor George Ticknor, sent him copies of his lectures on the subject. Prescott&#x27;s studies initially remained broad, but he started preparing material on Ferdinand and Isabella in January 1826. His acquaintance Pascual de Gayangos y Arce helped him construct a sizable personal library of historical books and manuscripts concerning the subject. Alexander Hill Everett, an American diplomat in Spain, also provided him with material which was unavailable to Prescott in Boston. However, progress was stalled almost immediately, due to a sudden deterioration in Prescott&#x27;s eyesight. Unable to find a reader fluent in Spanish, Prescott was forced to work through Spanish texts with an assistant who did not understand the language. When Alexander Everett heard of this situation, he provided Prescott with the services of George Lunt, who had adequate knowledge of Spanish for the task. However, this could only be a temporary arrangement, and he was replaced by a man named Hamilton Parker, who held the position for a year. Eventually George Ticknor, who was by then in charge of the department of modern literature at Harvard University, found James L. English, who worked with Prescott until 1831. Among the books studied by Prescott in this period, Ticknor lists Juan Antonio Llorente&#x27;s &quot;Historia crítica de la Inquisición de España&quot;, &quot;Historia de los Reyes Católicos don Fernando y doña Isabel&quot; by , Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Charles XII&quot; and William Roscoe&#x27;s &quot;Life of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici&quot;, which were to be the sources on which the &quot;History of Ferdinand and Isabella&quot; was to be based. In spring 1828, Prescott visited Washington, where he and Ticknor dined with John Quincy Adams at the White House, and saw Congress in session.

Due in part to his own condition, Prescott was interested in aiding the blind and partially sighted. The Perkins School for the Blind, then known as the New England Asylum, had been founded in Boston, Massachusetts by Samuel Gridley Howe, Thomas Handasyd Perkins and John Dix Fisher and 28 others in 1829. Prescott involved himself from the very start of the project, becoming a trustee in 1830. He published an article in support of education for the blind in the &quot;North American Review&quot; of July 1830, and helped to raise $50,000 for the organization in May 1833.

His work was disturbed in February 1829 by the unexpected death of his eldest daughter Catherine, who was only four years old. This led him to reconsider his position on religion—previously an agnostic, his interest in Christianity was renewed, and having read the Bible, the works of the theologian William Paley as well as more skeptical works such as Hume&#x27;s &quot;Of Miracles&quot;, he came to acknowledge the &quot;moral truth&quot; of the gospels, while remaining opposed to the doctrines of orthodox Christianity. Despite this personal tragedy, and his own continued ill health, Prescott had gathered sufficient material to begin drafting the &quot;History&quot; in October 1829. At around this time, Prescott read the works of Gabriel Bonnot de Mably, including his historiographical piece &quot;De l’étude de l’histoire&quot;. He henceforth aimed to write history to de Mably&#x27;s romantic ideal, and on more than one occasion expressed his indebtedness to him. Prescott also encountered &quot;Elogia de la Réina Doña Isabel&quot;, by his Spanish contemporary Diego Clemencín, which helped shape his views concerning the monarchs&#x27; political roles. Due to further problems with his eyesight, it took him sixteen months to write the first three hundred pages of the &quot;History&quot;. It was largely finished by 1834, but Prescott dedicated two years to abridging and redrafting it. He was also briefly engaged in writing a biography of Charles Brockden Brown for Jared Sparks&#x27; &quot;Library of American Biography&quot;. Prescott was not familiar with American literature, and he based the work on other contemporary biographies of Brown. As a result, the biography has had little academic impact. In 1835, he took residence in the rural town of Nahant, Massachusetts, due to concerns about his health. He was here accustomed to riding his horses for the purpose of exercise, and he persevered even in sub-zero temperatures. Prescott finished the concluding chapter of the work in July 1836, and despite the amount of time and effort which he had spent on the work, was at first unsure about publishing it. However, his father argued that refusing to do so would amount to cowardice, and this swayed him. Prescott had previously considered publishing the work in London first, and therefore a printed draft copy of the work was sent to a Colonel Aspinwall for consideration. However, both Longman and Murray, which were at the time the leading British publishers, refused the work, and Prescott decided to postpone.

The &quot;History of Ferdinand and Isabella&quot; was published on Christmas Day, 1837 by the American Stationery Company, Boston, with a print run of 500 copies. It was dedicated to his father. To the surprise of Prescott and the publisher, the book sold very well—the original print run was insufficient to adequately supply Boston&#x27;s bookshops, let alone the whole nation&#x27;s. It was first published in London by Richard Bentley in early 1838. The work received excellent critical reviews, both in America and in Britain, where Henry Vassall-Fox and Robert Southey expressed their admiration of the work. It was also noticed in France, despite the fact that a French translation was not available at the time. Prescott was adamant that his work should not be altered by anyone other than himself, and when he heard that his publishers were considering an abridgement of the &quot;History of Ferdinand and Isabella&quot; in June 1839, he produced an abridgement of the work himself, which resulted in the original project&#x27;s cancellation. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in May 1839.

=== The &quot;History of the Conquest of Mexico&quot; ===
Prescott expressed interest in his correspondence in writing a biography of Molière, and Ticknor records that he sent Prescott &quot;a collection of about 50 volumes&quot; of relevant material. However, after writing to Ángel Calderón de la Barca, a Spanish minister living in Mexico, and his wife Fanny who were able to provide source material, Prescott started research on what was to become the &quot;History of the Conquest of Mexico&quot;. He extensively read the works of Alexander von Humboldt, who had written on Mesoamerica, and started corresponding with the historian Washington Irving, the Swiss writer Sismondi and the French historian Jacques Nicolas Augustin Thierry. He also received assistance in collecting sources from a college friend, Middleton, and a Dr. Lembke. In contrast to the lengthy time spent researching the &quot;History of Ferdinand and Isabella&quot;, Prescott started drafting the &quot;History of the Conquest of Mexico&quot; in October 1839. However, Prescott faced difficulties in writing the work which he had not encountered previously. There was relatively little scholarship on Aztec civilization, and Prescott dismissed much of it as &quot;speculation&quot;, and he therefore had to rely almost exclusively on primary sources (with the exception of Humboldt). In particular, he considered Edward King&#x27;s theory that the pre-Columbian civilizations were non-indigenous to be fallacious, although he was greatly indebted to him for his anthology of Aztec codices in the Antiquities of Mexico. Prescott also studied Spanish writers contemporary to the conquest, most significantly Torquemada and Toribio de Benavente.
Prescott received three honorary degrees in this period—an honorary doctorate in laws from Columbia University in autumn 1840, the College of William and Mary in July 1841 and South Carolina College in December 1841. He also helped Frances Inglis find a publisher for her autobiographical work &quot;Life in Mexico&quot;. Moreover, Frances Inglis was one of Prescott&#x27;s most valuable correspondents during the writing of the &quot;History of the Conquest of Mexico.&quot; She is cited by Prescott five times throughout the text, and is described by him as, &quot;one of the most delightful of modern travellers.&quot;
Prescott found it difficult to evaluate Mesoamerican scientific and mathematical achievements, because of his relative ignorance of those subjects. While working in Boston in 1841, he met George Howard, who was to stay a close friend for the remainder of his life. Prescott worked industriously throughout 1840–1842, and as a result, the work was finished by August 1843. It was published by Harper &amp; Brothers, New York in December, Bentley issuing the British edition. His elderly father had had a stroke in October, which resulted in temporary paralysis, so Prescott spent most of the winter attending him in Pepperell. The &quot;History of the Conquest of Mexico&quot; was received extremely well, both critically and by the general public, despite Prescott&#x27;s fears to the contrary. Those praising the work included George Hillard in the &quot;North American Review&quot;, George Ticknor Curtis in the Christian Examiner, Joseph Cogswell in the &quot;Methodist Quarterly&quot;, as well as the Dean of St. Paul&#x27;s, Henry Hart Milman in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;. However, the Mexican author José Fernando Ramírez was a critic of the work.

=== The &quot;Conquest of Peru&quot; ===
In 1844, Prescott was painted by Joseph Alexander Ames, and also commissioned a bust from Richard Saltonstall Greenough. He was not active in researching for the &quot;Conquest of Peru&quot; until spring 1844, although he had already decided to write a work concerning Inca civilization while researching pre-Columbian Mexico, and listened to Inca Garcilaso de la Vega&#x27;s &quot;Comentarios Reales de los Incas&quot;. He further studied Pedro Cieza de León&#x27;s &quot;Crónicas del Perú&quot;, the works of Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa and Diego Fernández&#x27;s &quot;Primera y segunda parte de la Historia del Piru&quot;. Prescott&#x27;s progress was stalled by the unexpected death of his brother Edward at sea. His daughter Elizabeth was seriously ill, so Prescott and his family traveled to Niagara, which he considered a more healthy environment for her. After her recovery, they returned to Nahant in the summer, where Prescott started drafting the &quot;Conquest&quot;, and, as was his custom, spent the autumn in Peperell. Prescott&#x27;s father died at the age of 82 on December 8, which deeply upset him. He took a two-month break from writing to support his widowed mother and settle matters concerning his father&#x27;s estate. His father left numerous stocks, shares and property that amounted to $343,737, almost all of which was shared between Prescott and his sister. Prescott was elected to the Institut de France in February 1845, in recognition of his accomplishments as a historian. He took the place of Martín Fernández de Navarrete, who had died the previous year, after a vote was cast. He was also admitted to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin. In the summer of 1845, a collection of articles Prescott had published in the &quot;North American Review&quot; were published as &quot;Biographical and Critical Miscellanies&quot; by Bentley in octavo, and an edition was also prepared simultaneously by Harper &amp; Brothers in New York. Prescott was writing 12 pages of the work per day in the summer of 1845, and completed the first two chapters of the &quot;Conquest&quot;. He used the inheritance from his father to buy a house on Beacon Street in Boston. The building is now a National Historic Landmark, and is also known as the William Hickling Prescott House. Prescott moved into the house during December 1845, and set himself a year to finish the &quot;Conquest of Peru&quot;. In March, his eyesight, which had recovered significantly, suddenly deteriorated. Prescott also had acute dyspepsia and rheumatism, and he travelled to Nahant to &quot;benefit from the sea-air&quot;. This did not prevent him travelling to Washington, where he dined at the White House with President James K. Polk. He was also entertained by John Y. Mason, the former United States Secretary of the Navy, who informed him that a copy of Prescott&#x27;s &quot;Conquest of Mexico&quot; had been placed in the library of every fighting ship. The &quot;Conquest of Peru&quot; was completed in March 1847. As with previous works, it was published by Harper &amp; Brothers in the United States and Bentley in Britain. The original US print run was 7,500 copies, and the books were sold for $1 each. It was translated into Spanish, French, German and Dutch, and sold excellently. As with his previous works, it was also well-received critically.

=== Research on Philip II ===
Shortly after the publication of the &quot;Conquest of Peru&quot;, Prescott turned his mind to writing a history of Philip II of Spain, which he had been contemplating for several years. John Lothrop Motley, who planned to write an independent work on the subject, was aided by Prescott, who gave him access to his library. Although the two corresponded, there seems to have been little collaboration on their respective works. Prescott had started searching for sources as early as 1842, but a number of difficulties confronted him in his study of Philip II. The principal archives of historical material were held in Simancas, but neither Lembke (who had collected materials for the &quot;Conquest of Mexico&quot;) nor Middleton were able to gain access to them. They had been informed that the library was so disordered as to make productive research impossible, even if access had been gained. However, Lembke, who as a diplomat had been expelled from Spain, made the acquaintance of two wealthy Parisian scholars, Mignet and Ternaux-Compans, who offered him access to their manuscript collections. Furthermore, de Gayangos assisted greatly by locating important documents in the British Museum and in the collection of the bibliomaniac Thomas Phillipps, who owned around 60,000 manuscripts. He also borrowed several manuscripts from the archives in Brussels, having received letters from the respected Belgian diplomat Sylvain Van de Weyer in London. de Gayangos became Professor of Arabic literature at the Complutense University of Madrid in late 1842, and subsequently lent Prescott rare books and manuscripts from the university library. By the summer of 1848, Prescott had over 300 works on the subject at his disposal, but he continued to have serious problems with his eyesight; an examination by an oculist confirmed that there was untreatable damage to his retina. Prescott had been commissioned by the Massachusetts Historical Society to write a biography of the scholar John Pickering in 1848, which he wrote for publication later in that year. Prescott was invited to write a history of the Mexican–American War, but declined, as he was uninterested in writing on contemporary events.

Prescott&#x27;s main secondary source for the history was Leopold von Ranke&#x27;s &quot;Fürsten und Völker von Süd-Europa im sechzehnten und siebzehnten Jahrhundert&quot;, a comprehensive work which included a detailed history of the papacy. Prescott admired Ranke&#x27;s empirical historical method, and considered his work to be the best of his predecessors on the subject. He had four copies of the relevant sections of the work reprinted in a large typeface so he could read it without assistance. He had made a broad plan of the work by February 1849. Prescott started writing the draft on July 26. At this time, Prescott was a creditor of John White Webster, the chemist and murderer, and he was subsequently involved in his trial.

=== Visits to Washington and Europe ===

Prescott visited Washington D.C. in spring 1850, where he met Zachary Taylor, then President of the United States, as well as numerous other prominent figures, including Henry Bulwer, the British ambassador, and Daniel Webster, the former Secretary of State, who had been a friend of Prescott&#x27;s father. Soon afterward, he decided to visit England. He embarked from New York on May 22, and arrived at Liverpool on June 3. There he stayed with an old friend, Alexander Smith, and became reacquainted with Mary Lyell, the wife of the geologist Charles Lyell. He traveled with the Lyells to London, where they stayed in Mivart&#x27;s Hotel. Prescott was greeted in London, as in Washington, by the most important members of society—he dined with the Foreign Secretary and future Prime Minister Henry Temple, the former Prime Minister Robert Peel, as well as the elderly Duke of Wellington. He went to the races at Ascot, and was presented at court to Queen Victoria. On June 22, he traveled to Oxford to receive an honorary doctorate in law. In Oxford, he stayed at Cuddesdon Palace, the home of the Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, who was absent because of the christening of the infant Prince Arthur. Prescott met Spencer Compton, the president of the Royal Society, who was also receiving an honorary degree. He left London for Paris, where he arrived on July 20. Two days later, he traveled to Brussels, where he stayed in Coudenberg, the site of a residence of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, returning to London on July 29. Traveling north, Prescott visited Alnwick Castle and the ruins of Hulm Abbey in Northumbria. On his arrival in Edinburgh, he met the geologists Adam Sedgwick and Roderick Murchison, whom he accompanied to Inveraray, where he visited Inveraray Castle. Prescott then traveled south, through Staffordshire, where he was entertained by George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower. He embarked for New York on September 14, arriving on September 27.

=== Final works ===
Prescott spent the winter in Boston, and returned to the composition of his work. He gradually changed the focus of the &quot;History&quot;, deciding that he was a better writer of history than biography and worked solidly for the next two years, alternating between Boston and Nahant. This period was interrupted only by the marriage of his daughter Elizabeth in early 1852. Her husband was James Alexander; they settled in a house near the family home in Pepperell. Prescott&#x27;s mother fell ill on May 17 and died soon after, which caused Prescott to fall into a bout of depression that lasted until the winter. He returned to his work, and continued at the pace that he was able through the remainder of 1852 and 1853, which passed uneventfully. Prescott started to suffer seriously from rheumatism during the former year, and as a result he abandoned his residence at Nahant. He bought a house in the then rural town of Lynn, Massachusetts, where he was visited by Charles Lyell and his family in June 1853. On August 22, he finished the second volume of the &quot;History&quot;. The first two volumes were finished by May 1855, but not immediately published. Changes in British copyright law and a change of publishers caused Prescott to delay publication until November. Compared to his previous works, the &quot;History&quot; received little coverage in the press or in academic journals. It was suggested to him at this time that he should write a biography of Charles V, but he declined, as he regarded the work of William Robertson on the subject to be definitive. However, he wrote an appendix to Robertson&#x27;s &quot;The History of the reign of Charles V&quot; in May 1855; it was published in December 1856. Previously uninterested in politics (although he had predicted the Whig victory in 1840,) Prescott supported and voted for the Republican John C. Frémont in the 1856 Presidential election. He continued to work on the third volume of the &quot;History&quot; until he had a stroke on February 3, 1858. Prescott recovered, but his health was permanently affected, and he decided to temporarily retire from writing. The third volume was therefore published in April, and its scope was more limited than Prescott had originally planned. He worked on the Spanish translation of the &quot;Conquest of Mexico&quot;, which had been prepared by José Fernando Ramírez and Lucas Alamán.

== Personal life ==
William H. Prescott and Susan Amory Prescott (c. 1799–1859) had four children; the first, Catherine Prescott (1824–1829) died of a childhood illness. William Gardiner Prescott (1826–1895) attended Harvard from 1841 to 1844 and worked as a lawyer in Boston. He married Josephine Augusta Peabody on November 6, 1851, and inherited Headquarters House. William Gardiner&#x27;s daughter Catherine Elizabeth Prescott married Hebert Timmins on February 22, 1887. Elizabeth (1828–1864) married James Lawrence, a distant cousin. The youngest was William Amory (1830–1867).

In 1837, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society. In 1845 Prescott was elected an honorary member of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati.

== Death and legacy ==

In January 1859, Prescott decided to resume his work on Philip II, with the goal of writing a final fourth volume &quot;History of the Reign of Phillip II (1856–1858)&quot; which was completed only up to the year 1568 featuring the deaths of Phillips son Carlos, Prince of Asturias and of Phllips 3rd wife Elisabeth of Valois. On January 28, he had a second stroke, which resulted in his immediate death. He was buried with his parents in St. Paul&#x27;s Church, and his funeral was attended by representatives, among others, of Harvard University, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Essex Institute.

Prescott&#x27;s work has remained popular and influential to the present day, and his meticulous use of sources, bibliographical citations and critical notes was unprecedented among American historians. As the work of an amateur historian, the &quot;History of Ferdinand and Isabella&quot; was an outstanding achievement, and it arguably was the best English-language work on the subject published until then. The major problems with the work to the modern day historian are not related to the quality of the research or Prescott&#x27;s understanding of the period, but rather that his focus is on the major political and military events as opposed to social and economic conditions. It has also been argued that Prescott partially subscribed to the Great Man theory. The &quot;Conquest of Mexico&quot; has endured more than any other of Prescott&#x27;s work: it is regarded as his greatest literary accomplishment. However, modern scholarship agrees that there are problems with Prescott&#x27;s characterization of the conquest. David Levin has argued that the Conquest shows &quot;inadequate attention to detail&quot; and remains a broad and general account of events. In contrast to the &quot;Conquest of Mexico&quot;, the &quot;Conquest of Peru&quot; has received relatively little modern scholarly attention, perhaps due to some key similarities in style and structure. However, it is generally thought that the work was the authoritative account until the 20th century, and that Prescott used a broader range of source material than any previous writer on the subject. However, the archeological and anthropological aspects of both works have been heavily criticized by historians since the end of the 19th century. Prescott had never visited archeological sites in Mesoamerica and his understanding of Inca and Aztec culture was weak. In defense of Prescott, it has been argued that despite advances in archeological understanding, and a reconceptualization of the nature of pre-Columbian society, the works remain broadly historically accurate, and Prescott&#x27;s elaborations on fact were due to a fundamental lack of source material. In contrast, &quot;Phillip the Second&quot; is considered essentially an inferior piece—it lacks the epic structure and literary merits of Prescott&#x27;s other work, and the work has not received more critical attention than other contemporary accounts of the monarch&#x27;s life.

There is a popular misconception that Prescott was completely blind, which seems to have stemmed from a misunderstanding of his comment in the preface to &quot;The Conquest of Mexico&quot;, in which he stated, &quot;Nor have I ever corrected, or even read, my own original draft&quot;. The myth was further propagated by a contemporary New York review of the &quot;Conquest&quot;, and has been a common theme in popular accounts of his work. Other related embellishments of Prescott&#x27;s disability have also occurred—Samuel Eliot Morison, writing in a 1959 article for &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, claimed that Prescott had an artificial eye, although there is no evidence to suggest this. It has been argued that Prescott&#x27;s biographers have naturally been drawn to romanticize his life due to Prescott&#x27;s own romantic style of history.

Four biographies of Prescott have been written. In 1864, George Ticknor published a biography based on Prescott&#x27;s then-unpublished correspondence, to which the later biographers have been greatly indebted. Rollo Ogden&#x27;s 1904 account is more a stylistic modernization of Ticknor&#x27;s work. Harry Thurston Peck&#x27;s 1905 account is considered academically inferior due to its essentially derivative nature. C. Harvey Gardiner&#x27;s 1969 work is considered the definitive critical biography of Prescott, taking into account a wide range of unpublished documents that were unavailable to earlier biographers.

The City of Prescott in Arizona was named in his honor, as was the William H. Prescott House (Headquarters House), which was designated a National Historic Landmark for its association with him. William H. Prescott Elementary, established in 1899 and located in Chicago, Illinois, was named in honor of him. The building is designated as &quot;orange&quot; on the Chicago Historical Survey, reflecting its historical significance. Colegio Anglo Americano Prescott, a school in Arequipa, Peru, also bears his name. Prescott Street, two blocks from Harvard Yard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is named after him.

Historian Richard Kagan has identified &quot;Prescott&#x27;s Paradigm&quot; as a 19th-century interpretive model first fully articulated by Prescott. It argues that Spain&#x27;s early modern &#x27;decline&#x27; and subsequent &#x27;torpor&#x27; was a product of its religious bigotry and political despotism. The Prescott Paradigm was dominant in 20th century American historiography, but was showing signs of decline by the 1990s. Kagan wrote:
:What I call &quot;Prescott&#x27;s paradigm&quot; is an understanding of Spain as the antithesis of the United States. Most of the elements contained in this paradigm—anti-Catholicism, criticism of absolutism, support for commerce and individual liberty—were to be found in the work of other writers, but Prescott bundled them into a single package that offered a means of approaching Spanish history through the lens of that of U.S. history.

<text>Tender Mercies is a 1983 American drama film directed by Bruce Beresford and written by Horton Foote. It stars Robert Duvall as singer-songwriter Mac Sledge, a former country music star whose career and relationship with his ex-wife and daughter were wrecked by alcoholism. Recovering from his affliction, Sledge seeks to turn his life around through his relationship with a young widow and her son in rural Texas. The supporting cast includes Tess Harper, Betty Buckley, Wilford Brimley, Ellen Barkin and Allan Hubbard.

Financed by EMI Films, &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; was shot largely in Waxahachie, Texas. The script was rejected by several American directors before the Australian Beresford accepted it. Duvall, who sang his own songs in the film, drove more than 600 miles (1,000 km) throughout the state, tape recording local accents and playing in country music bands to prepare for the role. He and Beresford repeatedly clashed during production, at one point prompting the director to walk off the set and reportedly consider quitting the film.

The film encompasses several themes, including the importance of love and family, the possibility of spiritual resurrection amid death and the concept of redemption through Mac Sledge&#x27;s conversion to Christianity. Following poor test screening results, distributor Universal Pictures made little effort to publicise &quot;Tender Mercies&quot;, which Duvall attributed to the studio&#x27;s lack of understanding of country music.

The film was released on March 4, 1983, in a limited number of theatres. Although unsuccessful at the box office, it was critically acclaimed and earned five Academy Award nominations, including for Best Picture. At the 56th Academy Awards. &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; won Oscars for Best Original Screenplay for Foote and Duvall won the Academy Award for Best Actor.

==Plot==
Mac Sledge, a washed-up, alcoholic country singer, awakens at a run-down Texas roadside motel and gas station after a night of heavy drinking. He meets the owner, a young widow named Rosa Lee, and offers to perform maintenance work at the motel in exchange for a room. Rosa, whose husband was killed in the Vietnam War, is raising her young son, Sonny, on her own. She agrees to let Mac stay on condition that he does not drink while working. The two begin to develop feelings for each other, mostly during quiet evenings sitting alone and sharing parts of their life stories.

Mac resolves to give up alcohol and start his life anew. After enough days of keeping his word and doing his work, he is comfortable enough in his new life that he and Rosa Lee wed. They start attending a Baptist church on a regular basis. One day, a newspaper reporter visits the motel and asks Mac whether he has stopped recording music and if he has deliberately chosen to lead an anonymous life. When Mac refuses to answer, the reporter explains he is writing a story about him and has interviewed his ex-wife, Dixie Scott, a country music star who is performing nearby.

After the story is published, the neighbourhood learns of Mac&#x27;s past, and members of a local country–western band visit him to show their respect. Although he greets them politely, Mac remains reluctant to open up about his past. Later, he secretly attends Dixie&#x27;s concert. She passionately sings several songs that Mac wrote years earlier, and he leaves in the middle of the performance. Backstage, he talks to Dixie&#x27;s manager, his old friend, Harry. Mac gives him a copy of a new song he has written and asks him to show it to Dixie. Mac tries to talk to her but she becomes angry on seeing him and warns him to stay away from their 18-year-old daughter, Sue Anne.

On his return home, Mac assures Rosa Lee he no longer has any feelings for Dixie, whom he describes as &quot;poison&quot; to him. Later, Harry visits Mac to tell him, seemingly at Dixie&#x27;s urging, that the country music business has changed and his new song is no good. Hurt and angry, Mac drives away and nearly crashes the truck. He buys a bottle of whiskey but, returning home to a worried Rosa Lee and Sonny, he tells them he poured it out. He says he tried to leave Rosa Lee, but found he could not. Some time later, Mac and Sonny are baptised together in Rosa Lee&#x27;s church.

Eventually, Sue Anne visits Mac—their first encounter since she was a baby. Mac asks whether she got any of his letters, and she says her mother kept them from her. She also reports that Dixie tried to keep her from visiting Mac, and that, despite her mother&#x27;s objections, she is eloping with her boyfriend. Mac admits that he used to hit Dixie and that she divorced him after he tried to kill her in a drunken rage. Sue Anne asks whether Mac remembers a song about a dove he sang to her when she was a baby. He claims he does not, but after she leaves, he sings to himself the hymn &quot;On the Wings of a Dove,&quot; which refers to a dove from the Lord saving Noah, and to the Holy Spirit descending in the form of a dove at Jesus&#x27; baptism.

Boys at school bully Sonny about his dead father, and he and Mac grow closer. The members of the local country band ask Mac permission to perform one of his songs, and he agrees. Mac begins performing with them and they make plans to record together. His newfound happiness is interrupted when Sue Anne dies in a car accident. Mac attends his daughter&#x27;s funeral at Dixie&#x27;s lavish home in Nashville and comforts her when she breaks down. He also complains to Rosa Lee that, during their marriage, Dixie kept saying she would give up her career but never did.

Back home, Mac keeps quiet about his emotional pain, although he wonders aloud to Rosa Lee why his once sorry existence has been given meaning and, on the other hand, his daughter has died. Throughout his mourning, Mac continues his new life with Rosa Lee and Sonny. In the final scene, Sonny finds a football that Mac has left as a gift for him. Mac is watching the motel from a field across the road, singing &quot;On the Wings of a Dove&quot; to himself. Sonny thanks him for the football and the two play catch together in the field as Rosa Lee watches them from inside the motel through a window.

===Writing===
Playwright Horton Foote reportedly considered giving up on film writing, due to what he regarded as a poor adaptation of his 1952 play &quot;The Chase&quot; into a 1966 film of the same name, in which Robert Duvall had a supporting role. Following what Foote saw as a far more successful adaptation of his 1968 play &quot;Tomorrow&quot; in the 1972 feature film of the same name starring Duvall (who had his movie debut as Boo Radley in the 1962 film &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; that was scripted by Foote), his interest in filmmaking was rekindled, with the condition that he maintain some degree of control over the final product.

Foote said of this stage in his career, &quot;I learned that film really should be like theatre in the sense that, in theatre, the writer is, of course, very dominant ... If we don&#x27;t like something, we can speak our minds. ... It is always a collaborative effort. ... But in Hollywood it wasn&#x27;t so. A writer there has in his contract that you are a writer for hire, which means that you write a script, then it belongs to them.&quot; This renewed interest in cinema prompted Foote to write &quot;Tender Mercies&quot;, his first work written specifically for the screen. In the view of biographer George Terry Barr, the script reflected &quot;Foote&#x27;s determination to battle a Hollywood system that generally refuses to make such personal films.&quot;

The story was inspired partially by Foote&#x27;s nephew, who struggled to succeed in the country music business. Foote was initially interested in writing a film based on his nephew&#x27;s efforts to organise a band, which he saw as paralleling his own youthful attempts to find work as an actor. During his research, however, he met an experienced musician who had offered to help his nephew&#x27;s band, and Foote found himself growing more interested in a story about him, rather than the band itself. Foote said, &quot;This older man had been through it all. As I thought about a storyline, I got very interested in that type of character.&quot; The moment in the film where a woman asks, &quot;Were you really Mac Sledge?&quot; and he responds, &quot;Yes ma&#x27;am, I guess I was,&quot; was based on an exchange that Foote overheard between a washed-up star and a fan. Foote said the entire film pivots on that statement, which he believed spoke volumes about Mac&#x27;s personality and former status.

Foote based Sledge&#x27;s victory over alcoholism on his observations of theatre people struggling with the problem. He sought to avoid a melodramatic slant in telling that aspect of the story. Foote described his protagonist as &quot;a very hurt, damaged man ... silence was his weapon&quot;. He chose the title &quot;Tender Mercies&quot;, from the Book of Psalms, for its relation to the Rosa Lee character, who he said seeks only &quot;certain moments of gentleness or respite, [not] grandness or largeness&quot;. Foote sought to portray each character as realistic and flawed, but not unsympathetic. Although the script conveyed a strong spiritual message with religious undertones, Foote felt it was important to balance those religious elements with a focus on the practical challenges of everyday life.

Film historian Gary Edgerton said the &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; script &quot;catapulted Horton Foote into the most active professional period in his life.&quot; Film director and producer Alan J. Pakula credited the script with helping define the American independent film movement of the late 1980s by initiating a trend of personal filmmaking that often looks beyond Hollywood conventions.

===Development===
Duvall, who had appeared in &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; (1962), which Foote adapted from the Harper Lee novel, was involved in &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; as an actor and co-producer from its earliest stages. He said the script appealed to him because of the basic values it underlined and because the themes were universal even though the story was local. Duvall felt it portrayed people from the central region of the United States without parodying them, as he said many Hollywood films tend to do. Duvall&#x27;s early involvement led to rumors that he had requested Foote write the script for him, something that both men denied.

Foote took the script to Philip and Mary Ann Hobel, a married couple who ran Antron Media Production and had produced more than 200 documentaries between them. Foote felt their background in documentaries would lend &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; the authenticity he and Duvall were seeking. The Hobels agreed to produce it after reading and liking the script; it would become their feature film debut as producers. The Hobels approached EMI Films, a British film and television production company, which agreed to provide financing for &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; as long as Duvall remained involved, and under the condition the Hobels find a good director. The script was rejected by many American directors, creating concerns for Foote and the producers that the film would never be made. Foote later said, &quot;This film was turned down by every American director on the face of the globe.&quot; The Hobels eventually mailed the script to Australian director Bruce Beresford because they were impressed by his 1980 film &quot;Breaker Morant&quot;. Philip Hobel said, &quot;What we saw in &quot;Breaker Morant&quot; is what we like as filmmakers ourselves — an attention to the environment, a straightforward presentation; it&#x27;s almost a documentary approach.&quot;

Beresford was attracted to the idea of making a Hollywood film with a big budget and powerful distribution. Following his success with &quot;Breaker Morant&quot;, Beresford received about 150 Hollywood scripts as potential projects; although he went weeks before reading many of them, Beresford read &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; right away. It immediately appealed to him, in part because it dealt with aspects of American rural life he had seldom encountered in film scripts. Several of those involved with &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; had reservations about an Australian directing a film about a country music star. Beresford also found the decision strange, but kept his thoughts to himself because of his desire to direct the film. He contacted EMI Films and asked for one month to visit Texas and familiarize himself with the state before committing to direct, to which the company agreed. Beresford said of the trip, &quot;I want to come over and see if this is all true, because if it&#x27;s not really a true picture of what it&#x27;s all like, it wouldn&#x27;t be right to make it.&quot; During his visit to Texas, he saw parallels between the state and his homeland: the terrain reminded him of the Australian bush country, and the Texans he met in the isolated areas reminded him of residents of the Outback. He met Foote and discussed the script with him. The screenwriter, who gave Beresford tours of small Texas towns, felt the director&#x27;s Australian background made him sensitive to the story&#x27;s rural characters and would help him achieve the sought-for authenticity. Beresford agreed to direct and was hired after receiving final approval from Duvall (the actor had a clause in his contract allowing him such approval, the first time he had this power on a film).
The film was given a budget of $4.5 million ($ in dollars), modest by Hollywood standards at the time. Philip Hobel said it took about a year to secure the financing from EMI Films, whose major 1981 release, &quot;Honky Tonk Freeway&quot;, had done poor box office. For the primary location, Rosa Lee&#x27;s home and motel/gas station business, Beresford imposed one requirement: that no other buildings or large manmade structures be visible from it. The filmmakers eventually decided on a property that had been sitting abandoned by a Waxahachie highway. Mary Ann Hobel said the owner, when approached about its availability, immediately handed over the keys: &quot;We said, &#x27;Don&#x27;t you want a contract, something in writing?&#x27; And he said, &#x27;We don&#x27;t do things that way here.

Beresford, known for carefully planning every shot in his films, drew his own storyboards as well as detailed drawings of how he envisioned the sets. Jeannine Oppewall was hired as art director. Beresford praised her as &quot;absolutely brilliant&quot;, especially for her attention to very small details, &quot;going from the curtains to the color of the quilts on the floors.&quot; It was Oppewall who named the motel &quot;Mariposa&quot;, Spanish for &quot;butterfly&quot;, which symbolizes the spiritual resurrection Mac Sledge would experience there. Beresford chose Australian Russell Boyd as cinematographer and Irishman William Anderson, who had worked on all of the director&#x27;s previous features, as editor. He selected Elizabeth McBride as costume designer. It was her first time in the position on a feature film, and she went on to build a reputation for costuming Texan and other Southern characters.

===Casting===

Duvall had always wanted to play a country singer, and Foote was rumored to have written the role of Mac Sledge specifically for him. Foote denied the claim, claiming he found it too constraining to write roles for specific actors, although he did hope Duvall would be cast in the part. &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; became a very important personal project for Duvall, who contributed a significant number of ideas for his character.

Duvall was the first choice of director Robert Altman for the role of country superstar Haven Hamilton (subsequently played by Henry Gibson) in his 1975 film &quot;Nashville&quot;, but was not in the film due to a scheduling conflict. Reportedly, Duvall dropped out of the movie when Altman would not let him sing his own compositions.

In preparing for the role, he spent weeks roaming around Texas, speaking to strangers to find the right accent and mannerisms. He also joined a small country band and continued singing with them every free weekend while the film was being shot. In total, Duvall drove about to research the part, often asking people to speak into his tape recorder so he could practice their inflections and other vocal habits. Upon finding one man with the exact accent he wanted, Duvall had him recite the entire script into the recorder.

Tess Harper was performing on stage in Texas when she attended a casting call for a minor role in the film. Beresford was so impressed with her that he cast her in the lead. He later said that the actresses he had seen before her demonstrated a sophistication and worldliness inappropriate for the part, while she brought a kind of rural quality without coming across as simple or foolish. Beresford said of Harper, &quot;She walked into the room and even before she spoke, I thought, &#x27;That&#x27;s the girl to play the lead. Harper said she knew she won the role when Beresford appeared on her doorstep with a bottle of champagne in each hand. &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; was Harper&#x27;s feature film debut, and she was so excited about the role she bit her script to make sure it was real. When filming ended, Duvall gave her a blue cowgirl shirt as a gift with a card that read, &quot;You really &quot;were&quot; Rosa Lee&quot;.

Beresford visited several schools and auditioned many children for the role of Sonny before he came across Allan Hubbard in Paris, Texas. Beresford said Hubbard, like Harper, was chosen based on a simple, rural quality he possessed. The boy was able to relate easily to the character because, like Sonny, his father died at an early age; later, some media reports falsely claimed that his father was killed during the Vietnam War, just as Sonny&#x27;s was in the film&#x27;s backstory. None of the filmmakers knew Hubbard&#x27;s father had died until after filming began. Duvall developed a strong, trusting relationship with Hubbard, which Foote felt improved the duo&#x27;s on-screen chemistry. Hubbard would often play guitar with Duvall during breaks from filming.

Betty Buckley attended a casting session in New York City and was chosen largely based on the quality of her singing voice; Beresford said that few of the actresses who auditioned for the role were able to sing. Buckley was originally from Fort Worth, Texas, near the Grapevine Opry; when her concert scenes were filmed there, her whole family participated as extras. Duvall said he thought Buckley perfectly conveyed the underlying frustration of a country singer and &quot;brought a real zing to [the] part.&quot; The actual location of the bar scenes was in Seven Points, Texas, in a club called the Cedar Creek Opry House. Seven Points is just east of Ellis County, across the Trinity River in western Henderson County, Texas. The Opry House as it was known then, was a two-story building that used to be a skating rink in its earlier life. The old rink was upstairs and became the dance floor of the Opry House, where the concert and bar scenes were filmed. One scene of the movie shows the front of the building with its name visible.

Ellen Barkin was cast after impressing Beresford during a New York audition. At the time, she had appeared only in television movies; &quot;Diner&quot;, her feature film debut, was not yet in theaters. When filming on &quot;Diner&quot; wrapped, Barkin joked to her agent about future roles, &quot;No more troubled teenagers, unless the movie is with Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall or Robert Redford.&quot; Duvall said of Barkin, &quot;She brings a real credibility for that part, plus she was young and attractive and had a certain sense of edge, a danger for her that was good for that part.&quot; Some media outlets reported that Duvall and Barkin were involved romantically for a brief time during filming.

Wilford Brimley was cast at the urging of his good friend Duvall, who was not getting along well with Beresford and wanted &quot;somebody down here that&#x27;s on my side, somebody that I can relate to&quot;. Beresford felt Brimley was too old for the part, but eventually agreed to the casting.

===Filming===

Most of &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; was filmed in Waxahachie and Palmer, two towns in Ellis County in north central Texas. Beresford largely avoided the Victorian architecture and other picturesque elements of Waxahachie and instead focused on relatively barren locations more characteristic of West Texas. The town portrayed in the film is never identified by name. Foote said when he wrote the script he did not have the same isolated and lonely vision for the setting Beresford did, but he felt the atmosphere the director captured served the story well.

Principal photography took place between November 2 and December 23, 1981. The plants used in the gardening scenes were brought inside at night to keep them from freezing. Due to the tight schedule, the cast and crew worked seven days a week with very long hours each day. Although the Australian filmmakers and the crew, who were mostly from Dallas, got along very well both on and off the set, Beresford and Duvall were at odds during the production. Beresford, in his usual approach, meticulously planned each scene, and Duvall, who preferred a free-form give-and-take on set, felt restricted by the director&#x27;s methods. Although Duvall regularly acknowledged his talent as a director, he said of Beresford, &quot;He has this dictatorial way of doing things with me that just doesn&#x27;t cut it. Man, I have to have my freedom.&quot; Although he had no problem with Duvall&#x27;s acting methodology, the actor&#x27;s temperament infuriated Beresford. While filming one scene with Harper and Barkin, he became so frustrated during a phone conversation with Duvall that he said, &quot;Well if you want to direct the film, go right ahead,&quot; and walked off the set. Beresford flew to New York and reportedly was ready to quit, until Duvall flew out to speak with him. After further arguments, the two made amends and returned to work on the film.

Beresford also clashed on set with Brimley. On the very first day of filming, he asked the actor to &quot;pick up the pace&quot;, prompting Brimley to reply, &quot;Hey, I didn&#x27;t know anybody dropped it.&quot; On another occasion, when Beresford tried to advise Brimley on how Harry would behave, Duvall recalled Brimley responding, &quot;Now look, let me tell you something, I&#x27;m Harry. Harry&#x27;s not over there, Harry&#x27;s not over here. Until you fire me or get another actor, I&#x27;m Harry, and whatever I do is fine &#x27;cause I&#x27;m Harry.&quot; Duvall said he believed the on-set wrangling resulted in a combination of the director&#x27;s and actors&#x27; visions and ultimately improved the picture. Likewise, Beresford said he did not feel the fights negatively affected the film because he and Duvall never disagreed on the interpretation of the Mac Sledge character.

Harper described the extent to which Duvall inhabited his character: &quot;Someone once said to me, &#x27;Well, how&#x27;s Robert Duvall?&#x27; and I said, &#x27;I don&#x27;t know Robert Duvall. I know Mac Sledge very well. Beresford, too, said the transformation was so believable that he could feel his skin crawling up the back of his neck the first day of filming. Duvall made an effort to help Harper, who was making her film debut. While preparing to shoot a scene in which Mac and Rosa Lee fight, he yelled at a make-up artist in front of Harper to make her angry and fuel her performance; he apologized to the make-up artist after the scene was shot.

Cinematographer Russell Boyd largely used available light to give the movie a natural feel, which Beresford said was crucial to its sense of authenticity. Harper said Boyd was so quiet during filming that he mostly used just three words: Yeah&#x27;, &#x27;right&#x27; and &#x27;sure. Beresford, Foote and Duvall considered the climactic scene to be the one in which Mac, tending the family garden, discusses with Rosa Lee his pain over his daughter&#x27;s death. Beresford and Boyd filmed the scene in a long take and long shot so it could flow uninterrupted, with the lonely Texas landscape captured in the background. When studio executives received the footage, they contacted Beresford and requested close-up shots be intercut, but he insisted on keeping the long take intact. Duvall said he felt the scene underscored Mac&#x27;s stoicism in the face of tragedy and loss.

===Music===

&quot;Tender Mercies&quot; includes no original film score, and the musical soundtrack is limited to the performances of country songs and the domestic guitar playing that occur as part of the story. A score was composed for the movie, but Beresford had it removed because he felt it was &quot;too sweet&quot; and sounded phony in the context of the film, although he acknowledged it as &quot;very skillful&quot;. Duvall sang his own songs, a right he insisted be part of his contract. He commented, &quot;What&#x27;s the point if you&#x27;re not going to do your own [singing]? They&#x27;re just going to dub somebody else? I mean, there&#x27;s no point to that.&quot; The film&#x27;s financial backers were initially concerned about whether he could sing well enough for the role. Those concerns were allayed after Duvall produced a tape of himself singing a cappella &quot;On the Wings of a Dove&quot;, a Bob Ferguson country song featured in the film. Duvall collaborated with Beresford in deciding on the unusual staging of the emotional scene in which Mac sings it after reflecting on the reunion with his daughter. The song is performed with Mac looking out a window with his back to the camera, his face unseen. Horton Foote thought the choice made the scene more moving and called it &quot;an extraordinary moment&quot; in the film. Duvall wrote two of Mac&#x27;s other songs, &quot;Fool&#x27;s Waltz&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Decided to Leave Here Forever&quot;. Several leading country singers, including Willie Nelson, George Jones and Merle Haggard, were believed to have inspired Mac and Duvall&#x27;s portrayal of him, but Duvall insisted the character was not based on anyone in particular. Another country star, Waylon Jennings, complimented his performance, saying he had &quot;done the impossible.&quot;

Betty Buckley also sang her own songs, one of which, &quot;Over You&quot;, written by Austin Roberts and Bobby Hart, was nominated for an Academy Award. Although Buckley performed it in the film, country singer Lane Brody was chosen to record it for radio release, and Mac Davis later sang it at the 1984 Academy Awards ceremony. Other songs in the film include &quot;It Hurts to Face Reality&quot; by Lefty Frizzell, &quot;If You&#x27;ll Hold the Ladder (I&#x27;ll Climb to the Top)&quot; by Buzz Rabin and Sara Busby, &quot;The Best Bedroom in Town&quot; and &quot;Champagne Ladies &amp; Barroom Babies&quot; by Charlie Craig, &quot;I&#x27;m Drinkin&#x27; Canada Dry&quot; by Johnny Cymbal and Austin Roberts, and &quot;You Are What Love Means To Me&quot; by Craig Bickhardt.

==Themes and interpretations==

===Love and family===
Mac Sledge finds redemption largely through his relationship and eventual marriage with Rosa Lee. This is in keeping with the motif of fidelity common in the works of Foote, inspired, said the writer, by his marriage to Lillian Vallish Foote. He told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that she &quot;kept me goin&#x27;. She never lost faith, and that&#x27;s a rare thing. I don&#x27;t know now how we got through it, but we got through it.&quot; The lyrics of &quot;If You&#x27;ll Hold the Ladder&quot;, which Mac performs with his new country band in the second half of the film, suggest what love has done for him. He sings of someone holding the ladder for him as he climbs to the top; this is symbolic of Rosa&#x27;s love and guidance, which has allowed Sledge to improve himself and build a new life. The desultory romances that defined his past are represented by the more promiscuous lyrics of Dixie Scott&#x27;s songs, such as those of &quot;The Best Bedroom in Town&quot;: &quot;The best part of all / the room at the end of the hall / That&#x27;s where you and me make everything alright ... We celebrate the happiness we&#x27;ve found / Every night in the best bedroom in town&quot;. His storming out of her concert symbolizes his rejection of that earlier life. In contrast, Rosa Lee sings the humble church hymn, &quot;Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me&quot;. In a related way, the film emphasizes the importance of the woman&#x27;s role in domestic life - although Mac takes on the role of patriarch in his new family setting, it is only through the support and care of Rosa Lee that he is able to settle into this role. Sociologist Norman K. Denzin points out that &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; embodies many of the ideas of recovery from addiction that are part of the twelve-step program used by Alcoholics Anonymous. Both the film and the support group&#x27;s program advocate the idea of hitting rock-bottom, making a decision to stop drinking, dealing with the past and adopting a spiritual way of life.

&quot;Tender Mercies&quot; also emphasizes the father–child theme common in the works of Foote, a theme that operates on both transcendent and temporal levels. Mac is reunited not only with his spiritual father through his conversion to Christianity, but also with his biological daughter, Sue Anne, when she pays him a surprise visit. Scholar Rebecca Luttrell Briley suggests that although Mac begins to plant new roots with Rosa Lee and Sonny in earlier scenes, they are not enough to fully satisfy his desire for redemption, as he is nearly driven to leave the family and return to his alcoholic ways. According to Briley, Sue Anne&#x27;s visit prompts Mac to realize that reconciliation with her and a reformation of their father–daughter relationship is the ingredient that had been lacking in his quest for redemption. This is further demonstrated by Mac&#x27;s singing &quot;On the Wings of a Dove&quot; to himself after their meeting; the lyrics describe God the Father and God the Holy Spirit&#x27;s involvement in the baptism of God the Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. This connects Sledge&#x27;s spiritual reconciliation with the divine, to the earthly reconciliation with his own child. However, the death of Sue Anne also demonstrates that, according to Briley, &quot;all relationships cannot be mended, some by choice and some by chance, and the poignancy of missed opportunities between fathers and their children on this earth is underlined in this scene.&quot;

The relationship between Mac and Sonny, whose name derives from &quot;son&quot;, is central to the film&#x27;s exploration of the father–child theme. Sonny tries to conjure an image of his biological father, whom he never had the chance to know, through old photographs, his mother&#x27;s memories and visits to his father&#x27;s grave. Sonny finds a father figure in Mac. When another young boy asks Sonny if he likes Mac more than his real father, Sonny says that he does, because he never knew the other man; Briley says that this &quot;emphasizes the distinction between companionship and blood relationship Foote has pointed out before.&quot; The final scene, in which Mac and Sonny play catch with a football Mac bought him as a gift, symbolizes the fact that, although Mac has lost the chance to reconcile with his daughter, he now has a second chance at establishing a father–child relationship with Sonny. The father–child theme also plays out through Mac&#x27;s relationship with the young band members, who say that he has been an inspiration to them, playing a paternal role in their lives before they even met him. Sledge eventually teams up with the musicians, offering them fatherly counsel in a much more direct way.

===Religion===
Mac&#x27;s redemption and self-improvement run parallel with his conversion to Christianity. Briley argues that &quot;the emphasis on the Christian family is stronger in this script than in any other Foote piece to this point.&quot; At the urging of Rosa Lee, Mac begins to attend church regularly and is eventually baptized for the first time, along with Sonny. During a church scene, he also sings the hymn &quot;Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me&quot;, which serves as a symbol for his new direction in life. After they are baptized, Sonny asks Mac whether he feels any different, to which Mac responds, &quot;Not yet.&quot; According to scholars, this response indicates Mac&#x27;s belief that his reunion with God will lead to meaningful changes in his life. It is after this moment, Briley points out, that Mac is able to forge other relationships, such as those with his young bandmates, and &quot;develop his own potential for success as a man.&quot; Briley also proposes that Mac&#x27;s response — &quot;Yes, ma&#x27;am, I guess I was&quot; — to a fan who asks if he was really Mac Sledge suggests that he has washed away his old self through baptism.

During one scene, Rosa Lee tells Mac, &quot;I say my prayers for you and when I thank the Lord for his tender mercies, you&#x27;re at the head of the list.&quot; Scholar Robert Jewett compares this line to the first verse of Romans 12, in which Paul the Apostle appeals to Christians to live out their lives in service to others &quot;through the mercies of God&quot;. Many of the elements of Mac&#x27;s redemption, conversion to Christianity and budding relationship with Rosa Lee occur off-camera, including their wedding. Jewett writes, &quot;This is perfectly congruent with the theme of faith in the hidden mercies of God, the secret plot of the life of faith in Romans. ... It is a matter of faith, elusive and intangible.&quot; Jewett compares Mac&#x27;s story to that of Abraham, because &quot;just like Sledge&#x27;s story, [it] centers on the provision of a future through the tender mercies of God&quot;. As told in Romans 4, Abraham and his wife Sarah are too old to produce a son, but Abraham develops the faith that God will provide them an heir, which is exactly what occurs, though — as Paul describes — Abraham did nothing practical to guarantee or deserve such a miracle. Jewett describes Mac as similarly undeserving of redemption, based on his selfish and abusive past, typified by his condition in his first encounter with Rosa Lee: in a drunken stupor following a motel room fight. She takes him in and eventually falls in love with him, despite his having done nothing to deserve her care or his redemption: &quot;It is an undeserved grace, a gift of providence from a simple woman who continues to pray for him and to be grateful for him.&quot;

However, in the face of the loss of his daughter, Mac learns, in Briley&#x27;s words, that &quot;his life as a Christian is no more sheltered from this world&#x27;s tragedies than it was before.&quot; Before finding redemption, Sledge questions why God has allowed his life to take the path it has and, in particular, why his daughter was killed instead of him. Commentators have described this as a prime example of theodicy, the question of why evil exists that is commonly faced by Christians. Scholar Richard Leonard writes, &quot;For all believers, the meaning of suffering is the universal question. ... No answer is completely satisfying, least of all the idea that God sends bad events to teach us something.&quot; Following the death of his daughter, Mac moves forward with uncertainty as the film ends. Jewett writes of this conclusion, &quot;The message of this film is that we have no final assurances, any more than Abraham did. But we can respond in faith to the tender mercies we have received.&quot;

===Death and resurrection===

Mac experiences his spiritual resurrection even as he wrestles with death, in both the past — Sonny&#x27;s father in the Vietnam War — and present — his own daughter in a car accident. The latter threatens to derail Mac&#x27;s new life, captured in the moment when he learns of it and turns off the radio that is playing his new song. Leonard writes of this resurrection, &quot;Depression hangs like a pall over &quot;Tender Mercies&quot;, [but] what makes this film inspiring is that it is also about the joy of being found. ... Mac finds the way, the truth, and the life he wants.&quot; In a climactic scene, Mac tells Rosa Lee that he was once nearly killed in a car crash himself, which forces him to address the question of why he was allowed to live while others have died. Jewett writes of this scene, &quot;Mac Sledge can&#x27;t trust happiness because it remains inexplicable. But he does trust the tender mercies that mysteriously led him from death to life.&quot;

Mac is portrayed as near death at the beginning of the film, having woken up in a drunken stupor in a boundless, empty flatland with nothing in his possession, a shot that scholar Roy M. Anker said &quot;pointedly reflects the condition of his own soul&quot;. The dialogue in other scenes suggests the threat of mortality, including a moment when Mac has trouble singing due to his bad voice and says, &quot;Don&#x27;t feel sorry for me, Rosa Lee, I&#x27;m not dead yet.&quot; In several lasting shots, the vast sky dwarfs Mac, Rosa Lee and Sonny, starkly symbolizing their isolation, as well as the fragility of human existence. The fact that Mac sustains his newfound life with Rosa Lee and Sonny after his daughter&#x27;s death, rather than reverting to his old pattern of alcoholism and abuse, is consistent with a recurring theme in Foote&#x27;s works of characters overcoming tragedy and finding in it an opportunity for growth and maturation.

==Release==

===Distribution===
Philip and Mary Ann Hobel spent a long time seeking a distributor for &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; without any success. Duvall, who began to doubt the film would be widely released, was unable to help the Hobels because he was busy trying to find a distributor for &quot;Angelo My Love&quot;, a film he had written, directed and produced. Eventually, Universal Pictures agreed to distribute &quot;Tender Mercies&quot;. Test screenings for the film were held, which Beresford described as the most unusual he had ever experienced. The director said that the preview audiences appeared to be very engaged with the picture, to the point the theaters were so silent, &quot;if you flicked a piece of paper on the floor, you could hear it fall.&quot; However, the post-screening feedback was, in Beresford&#x27;s words, &quot;absolutely disastrous.&quot; As a result, Universal executives lost faith in the film and made little effort to promote it. Foote said of the studio, &quot;I don&#x27;t know that they disliked the film, I just think they thought it was inconsequential and of no consequence at all. I guess they thought it would just get lost in the shuffle.&quot; Others in the film industry were equally dismissive; one Paramount Pictures representative described the picture as &quot;like watching paint dry&quot;.

===Festivals and theatrical run===
&quot;Tender Mercies&quot; was released on March 4, 1983, in only three theaters: one in New York City, one in Los Angeles, and one in Chicago. &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Vincent Canby observed that it was released during &quot;the time of year when distributors usually get rid of all of those movies they don&#x27;t think are worth releasing in the prime moviegoing times of Christmas and the midsummer months&quot;. The simultaneous release of &quot;Angelo My Love&quot; led to some more publicity for Duvall himself, but was of no help to &quot;Tender Mercies&quot;. Duvall also believed that Universal&#x27;s lack of familiarity and comfort with southern culture and the country music genre further reduced their faith in the film. When country star Willie Nelson offered to help publicize it, a studio executive told Duvall she did not understand how the singer could contribute to the promotion, which Duvall said was indicative of the studio&#x27;s failure to understand both the film and the country music genre.

&quot;Tender Mercies&quot; was shown in competition at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival, where it was described as a relatively optimistic alternative to darker, more violent entries like &quot;One Deadly Summer&quot;, &quot;Moon in the Gutter&quot; and &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence&quot;. It was also shown at the 1983 International Film Festival of India in New Delhi. A jury headed by director Lindsay Anderson determined that none of the films in contention, including &quot;Tender Mercies&quot;, were good enough to win the Golden Peacock, the festival&#x27;s top prize. Film critic Jugu Abraham said the jury&#x27;s standards were higher than those of the Academy Awards, and that &quot;Tender Mercies&quot;″ lack of success at the festival was a &quot;clear example of what is good cinema for some, not being so good for others&quot;.

===Home media===
Following its brief theatrical run, Universal Pictures quickly sold the film&#x27;s rights to cable companies, allowing &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; to be shown on television. When the film unexpectedly received five Academy Award nominations nearly a year after its original release, the studio attempted to redistribute the film to theaters; however, the cable companies began televising the film about a week before the Oscar ceremony, which essentially halted any attempts at a theatrical re-release. When the film first played on HBO in March 1984, it surpassed the three major networks in ratings for homes with cable televisions. &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; was released on VHS some time later, and was first released on DVD on June 22, 1999.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Tender Mercies&quot; was not considered a box office success. In its first three days, March 4–6, the film grossed $46,977 from exclusive engagements at the Tower East Theater in New York ($21,183), the Fine Arts Theater in Los Angeles ($18,254) and the Carnegie Theater in Chicago ($7,540). &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; eventually played at a total of 37 theaters and grossed $8,443,124.

===Critical response===

&quot;Tender Mercies&quot; received mostly positive reviews. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; declared it the &quot;best American movie of the new year&quot;. Carol Olten of &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; declared &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; the best movie of 1983, and &quot;the most poignant, but forthright, film of the year, with a brilliant performance by Robert Duvall&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;This is a small, lovely and somewhat overloaded film about small-town life, loneliness, country music, marriage, divorce and parental love, and it deals with all of these things in equal measure. Still, the absence of a single, sharply dramatic story line is a relatively small price to pay for the plainness and clarity with which these other issues are defined.&quot; She also praised Beresford&#x27;s direction, which she said lent the movie a light touch. The &quot;Times&quot;″ Canby wrote, &quot;In all respects &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; is so good that it has the effect of rediscovering a kind of film fiction that has been debased over the decades by hack moviemakers, working according to accepted formulas, frequently to the applause of the critics as well as the public.&quot; Leonard Maltin gave it three out of four stars, applauding Duvall in particular and describing it as a &quot;winning but extremely low-key film&quot;, though he characterized Foote&#x27;s screenplay as &quot;not so much a story as a series of vignettes&quot;. David Sterritt of &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; praised the film for its values, for underscoring the good in people and for avoiding flashiness and quick cuts in favor of a subtle and deliberately paced story, while maintaining a PG rating and omitting sex, drugs and violence. He also felt, however, that it tended toward melodrama on a few occasions and that the soundtrack had &quot;a bit of syrupy music ... especially at the end&quot;.

Some reviews were less favorable. David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; said, &quot;While one respects the filmmaker&#x27;s small-is-beautiful philosophy, this story may indeed be too small for its britches. ... Beresford&#x27;s nice little movie seems so afraid to make a false move that it runs the danger of not moving at all.&quot; Linda Beath of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; said Duvall&#x27;s performance was &quot;fabulous,&quot; but that the film was &quot;very slight&quot; compared to Beresford&#x27;s Australian pictures. Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; panned the film, criticizing its mood and tempo and describing Buckley as its only true asset: &quot;&quot;Tender Mercies&quot; fails because of an apparent dimness of perception that frequently overcomes dramatists: they don&#x27;t always know when they&#x27;ve got ahold of the wrong end of the story they want to tell.&quot;

Many critics specifically praised Duvall&#x27;s performance. Sterritt called it &quot;one of the most finely wrought achievements to reach the screen in recent memory.&quot; In Corliss&#x27;s description, &quot;Duvall&#x27;s aging face, a road map of dead ends and dry gulches, can accommodate rage or innocence or any ironic shade in between. As Mac he avoids both melodrama and condescension, finding climaxes in each small step toward rehabilitation, each new responsibility shouldered.&quot; Ansen said, &quot;Robert Duvall does another of his extraordinary disappearing acts. He vanishes totally inside the character of Mac Sledge.&quot; Maslin said he &quot;so thoroughly transformed into Mac that he even walks with a Texan&#x27;s rolling gait&quot;; she also complimented the performances of the supporting cast. According to a review in &quot;People&quot;, &quot;Duvall gives it everything he has, which is saying a great deal. His beery singing voice is a revelation, and his unfussy, brightly burnished acting is the kind for which awards were invented.&quot; The review also described Betty Buckley as &quot;bitchy and brilliant&quot;. Duvall was praised as well for pulling off his first true romantic role; the actor said of the response, &quot;This is the only film where I&#x27;ve heard people say I&#x27;m sexy. It&#x27;s real romantic. Rural romantic. I love that part almost more than anything.&quot;

Reflecting on the film a decade after it came out, critic Danny Peary said he found Duvall&#x27;s restrained portrayal &quot;extremely irritating&quot; and criticized the entire cast, save for Buckley, for their &quot;subdued, emotions-in-check, phony &#x27;honest&#x27; performances. You just wish the whole lot of them would start tickling each other.&quot; In his book &quot;Alternate Oscars&quot;, listing his personal opinions of who should have won the Academy Awards each year, Peary excluded &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; from all the categories, and chose Michael Caine as deserving of the Best Actor honor for &quot;Educating Rita&quot;. In June 2009, critic Roger Ebert included &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; in &quot;The Great Movies&quot;, his series of reviews celebrating what he considers the most important films of all time. He praised what he called one of Duvall&#x27;s most understated performances, as well as Foote&#x27;s minimalist storytelling and the restraint and patience of Beresford&#x27;s direction. Ebert said of Foote&#x27;s screenplay, &quot;The down-to-earth quality of his characters drew attention away from his minimalist storytelling; all the frills were stripped away. ... Rarely does a movie elaborate less and explain more than &quot;Tender Mercies&quot;.&quot;

==Accolades==
The 56th Academy Awards nominations were announced about 10 months after &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; was released. Little had been done to promote its candidacy: only four Oscar campaign advertisements were purchased; all of them appeared in the trade journal &quot;Variety&quot;, and Duvall had declined to campaign for himself or the film. Beresford and studio executives were surprised when the film was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Harper was believed by some to be a strong contender for either Best Actress or Best Supporting Actress, but ultimately she was nominated in neither category.

Duvall was the only American actor nominated for the Best Actor Oscar; his competition were Britons Michael Caine (who had co-starred with Duvall in the 1976 &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot;), Tom Conti, Tom Courtenay and Albert Finney. During an interview before the Oscar ceremony, Duvall offended some Britons by complaining about &quot;the Limey syndrome,&quot; claiming &quot;the attitude with a lot of people in Hollywood is that what they do in England is somehow better than what we do here.&quot; Duvall, who was presented with the Oscar by country music star, Dolly Parton, said of winning the award, &quot;It was a nice feeling, knowing I was the home-crowd favorite.&quot; In a &quot;New York Times&quot; profile of Duvall that appeared six years after &quot;Tender Mercies&quot;″ release, Nan C. Robertson wrote that, despite four previous Academy Award nominations, &quot;it was not until he won as Best Actor in 1983 ... that moviegoers woke up in droves to this great natural resource. The reason was that they rarely recognized Mr. Duvall from one part to another, so effortlessly did he vanish into each celluloid persona.&quot; Foote, who was so certain he would not win the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; he had not attended the 1963 ceremony, made sure he was present to collect his award for Best Original Screenplay. The critical success of the film allowed Foote to exercise considerable control over his future film projects, including final veto power over major decisions; when such power was denied, Foote would simply refuse to do the film.

<doc id="113446" wikidata="Q907445" url="?curid=113446" title="Sonny &amp; Cher">
<text>Sonny &amp; Cher were an American pop and entertainment duo in the 1960s and 1970s, made up of spouses Sonny Bono and Cher. The couple started their career in the mid-1960s as R&amp;B backing singers for record producer Phil Spector.

The pair first achieved fame with two hit songs in 1965, &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Go&quot; and &quot;I Got You Babe&quot;. Signing with Atco/Atlantic Records, they released three studio albums in the late 1960s, as well as the soundtrack recordings for two unsuccessful movies, &quot;Good Times&quot; and &quot;Chastity&quot;, with Cher contributing vocals to one cut, &quot;Chastity&#x27;s Song (Band of Thieves)&quot;. In 1972, after three years of silence, the couple returned to the studio and released two other albums under the MCA/Kapp Records label.

In the 1970s, they also positioned themselves as media personalities with two top-ten TV shows in the US, &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot; and &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Show&quot;. The couple&#x27;s career as a duo ended in 1975 following their divorce. In the decade they spent together, Sonny and Cher were nominated for two Grammy Awards and sold over 40 million records worldwide. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked them No. 18 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.

Performing under her first name, Cher went on to a highly successful career as a solo singer and actress, while Sonny Bono was eventually elected to Congress as a Republican U.S. Representative from California. The two performers were inducted to the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1998, following Sonny&#x27;s death in a skiing accident.

==Career==

===1962–1964: The origin===
Cherilyn Sarkisian first met Salvatore Bono in a Los Angeles coffee shop in November 1962, when she was sixteen. Eleven years her senior, Bono was working for record producer Phil Spector at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood. The two became best friends, eventual lovers, and were supposedly married in 1964, but both Cher and Bono say in their autobiographies that it was not an official marriage. They were legally wed after their only child, Chastity (later Chaz), was born. Through Bono, Cher started as a session singer, and sang backup on several of Spector&#x27;s classic recordings, including &quot;Be My Baby&quot; by the Ronettes, &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Loving Feeling&quot; by The Righteous Brothers and Darlene Love&#x27;s &quot;A Fine, Fine Boy&quot;. In Darlene Love&#x27;s recording, the listener can clearly hear Cher and Sonny close to the mic (along with Love, who recorded her own backing vocals).

===1965–1966: Career development===
With Bono continuing to write, arrange and produce the songs, the couple&#x27;s first incarnation was as the duo &quot;Caesar and Cleo&quot;. They released some singles in 1964, including &quot;The Letter&quot;, with Vault Records, and &quot;The Letter&quot;, &quot;Do You Wanna Dance&quot; and &quot;Love Is Strange&quot;, with Reprise Records.

In September 1964, they released &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Go&quot; under the name of Sonny &amp; Cher, which became their first regional hit. The song was later included on the 1965 Reprise compilation &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Go – Sonny &amp; Cher and Friends&quot;, which also included songs from artists such as Bill Medley, The Lettermen and The Blendells.

The duo released their first album &quot;Look at Us&quot; in the summer of 1965. The album contained the number one single &quot;I Got You Babe&quot;. &quot;Look at Us&quot; peaked at number two on the Billboard chart for eight weeks in the later part of 1965.

Sonny &amp; Cher made their first promotional tour of Britain in the first two weeks of August1965. The tour was organized and overseen by Larry Page, co-manager of the English rock band the Kinks, who met Cher a month earlier while she finished recording her debut album and while the Kinks toured America. Page and Brian Sommerville, the Kinks&#x27; publicist, quickly signed to be Sonny &amp; Cher&#x27;s European business manager and British publicist, respectively. During their two weeks in Britain, Sonny &amp; Cher primarily appeared on British television and radio, but they also performed at the 100 Club in central London on August 5.

The couple appeared on many of the top television shows of the era including &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;Where The Action Is&quot;, &quot;Hollywood A Go-Go&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Palace&quot;, &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;, &quot;Beat Club&quot;, &quot;Shindig!&quot;, &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. They also appeared as themselves in the film &quot;Wild on the Beach&quot;, singing &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Rain&quot;. On their first album Bono also displayed his political interest long before running for Congress in the lyrics of the song, &quot;The Revolution Kind&quot;.

As the followup to the success of &quot;Look at Us&quot;, they released their second studio album in April 1966, &quot;The Wondrous World of Sonny &amp; Chér&quot;, which peaked at number 34. The two dressed in animal skins with Bono wearing knee-high caveman boots and Cher going barefoot.

During 1965, five of their songs were in US Billboard Top 20, a record passed only by Elvis Presley and behind famous artists like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and others. Periodic solo releases by Cher continued during this period, including major successes with &quot;Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)&quot;, and Burt Bacharach &amp; Hal David&#x27;s theme from &quot;Alfie&quot; (as heard in the motion picture &quot;Alfie&quot;, as well as a single release), both in 1966. Because they sided with the young people being harassed on the Sunset Strip during the Sunset Strip curfew riots; they were removed from their promised position of honor in the Tournament of Roses Parade in January 1967.

===1967–1969: Career woes===

In 1967, Sonny and Cher released their third album, &quot;In Case You&#x27;re In Love&quot;. It peaked at number 45 in the U.S. charts. It contained two hit singles, both written by Bono, &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot; ( 6 on the Billboard Hot 100) and &quot;Little Man&quot; (No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100).

In an attempt to capitalize on the duo&#x27;s initial success, Bono speedily arranged a film project for the duo to star in, but the 1967 feature, &quot;Good Times,&quot; was a major bomb, despite the efforts of fledgling director William Friedkin and co-star George Sanders. After &quot;Good Times&quot; flopped in 1968, Columbia Pictures immediately sold rights to their intended follow-up film &quot;Speedway&quot; to MGM. The couple were replaced by Elvis Presley and Nancy Sinatra. In 1969, another film, &quot;Chastity&quot;, starring Cher, written and produced by Sonny, was also a commercial bomb.

Sonny and Cher&#x27;s career had stalled by 1968 as album sales quickly dried up. Their gentle, easy-listening pop sound and drug-free life had become unpopular in an era increasingly consumed with the psychedelic rock of the evolving landscape of American pop culture during the late 1960s.

Bono decided to forge ahead, carving a new career for the duo in Las Vegas resorts, where they sharpened their public persona with Cher as the wise-cracking, glamorous singer, and Bono as the good-natured recipient of her insults. In reality, Bono controlled every aspect of their act, from the musical arrangements to the joke-writing. While success was slow to come, their luck improved when network TV talent scouts attended a show, noting their potential appeal for a variety series.

Sonny and Cher also welcomed their first child, Chastity (named after Cher&#x27;s movie), born on March 4, 1969.

===1970–1977: TV success, Cher goes solo and divorce===

In 1970, Sonny and Cher starred in their first television special, &quot;The Nitty Gritty Hour&quot;, a mixture of slapstick comedy, skits, and live music. The appearance was a critical success, which led to numerous guest spots on other television shows. They also appeared in &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot; as guest stars.

Sonny and Cher caught the eye of CBS head of programming Fred Silverman while guest-hosting &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, and Silverman offered the duo their own variety show. &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot; debuted in 1971 as a summer replacement series. The show returned to prime time later that year and was an immediate hit, quickly reaching the Top 10. The show received 15 Emmy Award nominations during its run, winning one for direction, throughout its initial four seasons on CBS. The duo also revived their recording career, releasing the album &quot;All I Ever Need Is You&quot;, and charting two more top ten hits: &quot;All I Ever Need Is You&quot;, and &quot;A Cowboy&#x27;s Work Is Never Done&quot; in 1972.
Sonny and Cher&#x27;s dialogues were patterned after the successful nightclub routines of Louis Prima and Keely Smith: the happy-go-lucky husband squelched by a tart remark from the unamused wife. The show featured a stock company of zany comedians, including Teri Garr, Freeman King, Ted Ziegler, Billy Van and Murray Langston (later The Unknown Comic on &quot;The Gong Show&quot;). One sketch satirizing CBS&#x27;s detective show &quot;Cannon&quot; and its portly star William Conrad was so successful that Sonny and Cher staged several follow-ups, with Tony Curtis as &quot;Detective Fat&quot;. Everybody in these sketches wore wide-waisted &quot;fat suits&quot; (similar to hoop skirts), so Detective Fat &quot;and&quot; his clients &quot;and&quot; his suspects would spend most of the time bumping each other and bouncing across the crowded room. Around this time, Cher had become a major star on her own, due in part of the success of the singles &quot;Gypsies Tramps and Thieves&quot; and &quot;Half-Breed&quot;, both of which reached number one on the pop charts.

By the third season of the &quot;Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot; (1974), the marriage of Sonny and Cher was falling apart; the duo separated later that year. The show imploded, while still rating in the top 10. What followed was a very public divorce (finalized on June 26, 1975). Cher won a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance By an Actress in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy for &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot; in 1974.

Bono launched his own show, &quot;The Sonny Comedy Revue&quot;, in the fall of 1974, retaining the &quot;Sonny and Cher&quot; troupe of comedians and writers. Cher also announced plans to star in a new variety series of her own. Critics predicted that Bono would be the big winner with a solo comedy vehicle, and held little hope for Cher&#x27;s more musical showcase. After only six weeks, however, Bono&#x27;s show was abruptly canceled.

The &quot;Cher&quot; show debuted as an elaborate, all-star television special on February 16, 1975, featuring Flip Wilson, Bette Midler, and special guest Elton John. Cloris Leachman and Jack Albertson both won Emmy Awards for their appearances as guest-stars a few weeks later, and the series received four additional Emmy nominations that year. The first season ranked in the Top 25 of the year-end ratings.

As a result of the divorce, Sonny and Cher went their separate ways until Cher attended the opening of one of Bono&#x27;s restaurants in something of a reconciliation. &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Show&quot; returned in 1976, even though they were no longer married (the duo &quot;reunited&quot; with a humorous handshake). After struggling with low ratings through 1977, Sonny and Cher finally parted ways for good. In 1976, Mego Toys also released a line of toys and dolls, in the likeness of Sonny &amp; Cher. The release of these fashion dolls coincided with the popularity of &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Show&quot;.

===1978–1999: After Sonny and Cher===
Sonny Bono went on to an acting career and later entered politics, eventually becoming a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. Cher went on to become a Grammy Award-winning solo singer and an Academy Award-winning actress.

The couple made two surprise impromptu reunion performances: the first on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; in the spring of 1979, singing a medley of &quot;United We Stand&quot; and &quot;Without You&quot;, and the second on November 13, 1987, on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; where they performed their hit song &quot;I Got You Babe&quot;; it turned out to be the last time the two would perform together.

In early 1999, &quot;And the Beat Goes On: The Sonny and Cher Story&quot;, directed by David Burton Morris and starring Jay Underwood and Renee Faia, was broadcast on ABC. The TV movie was based on the autobiography of Bono, and focuses on the relationship between the couple during the early 1960s to their divorce in the mid-1970s. This movie was also nominated for two Emmy Awards.

==Bono&#x27;s death, music copyright==

On January 5, 1998, Bono died of injuries from hitting a tree while skiing at Heavenly Ski Resort in Lake Tahoe. He was 62 years old. Bono&#x27;s death came just days after Michael Kennedy died in a similar accident. Bono&#x27;s widow, Mary, was selected to fill the remainder of his congressional term, and was re-elected in her own right, serving until she was defeated for re-election in 2012. She continues to champion many of her late husband&#x27;s causes, including the ongoing fight as how to best save the Salton Sea.

The funeral, unbeknownst to Cher, was broadcast live on CNN. She gave a tearful eulogy, after which the attendees sang the song &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot;. In front of millions, Cher tearfully and effusively praised Bono, calling him &quot;the most unforgettable character I&#x27;ve ever met&quot;. His final resting place is Desert Memorial Park in nearby Cathedral City, California, the same cemetery in which Frank Sinatra was laid to rest later that same year. The epitaph on Bono&#x27;s headstone reads: &quot;And The Beat Goes On&quot;.

In 1998, Sonny and Cher received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television. Cher appeared at the event with Mary Bono, who accepted the award on behalf of her late husband. Cher paid tribute to Bono in the CBS special &quot;Sonny and Me: Cher Remembers&quot;, calling her grief &quot;something I never plan to get over&quot;. During the same year, Cher also released her twenty-second album &quot;Believe&quot; that was highly influenced by Bono&#x27;s death, and in the booklet Cher wrote &quot;In memory of Son&quot;.

When Cher and Bono divorced, they agreed to split revenue from the songs recorded together. When Bono died, one-third of his interest passed to wife Mary Bono, and one-sixth interests were split amongst his children. Cher sued UMG in 2009, claiming she and Bono&#x27;s heirs were owed $5,000,000 in &quot;hidden&quot; royalties.

== Legacy and achievements ==
Author Joseph Murrells described Sonny &amp; Cher as &quot;part of the leading exponents of the rock-folk-message type of song, a hybrid combining the beat and instrumentation of rock music with folk lyrics and often lyrics of protest.&quot;

&quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot; received numerous Emmy nominations; Director Art Fisher won for Outstanding Directing for a Variety Series in 1972. Cher won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy in 1974.

Sonny and Cher received the following honors:

<text>A Passage to India is a 1924 novel by English author E. M. Forster set against the backdrop of the British Raj and the Indian independence movement in the 1920s. It was selected as one of the 100 great works of 20th-century English literature by the &quot;Modern Library&quot; and won the 1924 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction. &quot;Time&quot; magazine included the novel in its &quot;All Time 100 Novels&quot; list. The novel is based on Forster&#x27;s experiences in India, deriving the title from Walt Whitman&#x27;s 1870 poem &quot;Passage to India&quot; in &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;.

The story revolves around four characters: Dr. Aziz, his British friend Mr. Cyril Fielding, Mrs. Moore, and Miss Adela Quested. During a trip to the fictitious Marabar Caves (modelled on the Barabar Caves of Bihar), Adela thinks she finds herself alone with Dr. Aziz in one of the caves (when in fact he is in an entirely different cave; whether the attacker is real or a reaction to the cave is ambiguous), and subsequently panics and flees; it is assumed that Dr. Aziz has attempted to assault her. Aziz&#x27;s trial, and its run-up and aftermath, bring to a boil the common racial tensions and prejudices between Indians and the British during the colonial era.

==Background==

&quot;A Passage to India&quot; is a reflection of Forster&#x27;s visit to India in 1912–13 and his duration as private secretary to Tukojirao III, the Maharajah of Dewas Senior in 1921–22. He dedicated the book to his friend Ross Masood.

==Plot summary==
British schoolmistress Adela Quested and her elderly friend Mrs. Moore visit the fictional Indian city of Chandrapore. Adela is to decide if she wants to marry Mrs. Moore&#x27;s son, Ronny Heaslop, the city magistrate.

Meanwhile, Dr. Aziz, a young Indian Muslim physician, is called from dining with friends by Major Callendar, Aziz&#x27;s superior at the hospital, but is delayed. Disconsolate at finding him gone, Aziz walks back and enters his favourite mosque on impulse. Seeing Mrs Moore there, he yells at her not to profane this sacred place, but the two then chat and part as friends. When Mrs. Moore relates her experience later, Ronny becomes indignant at the native&#x27;s presumption.

Because the newcomers had expressed a desire to meet Indians, Mr. Turton, the city tax collector, invites several to his house, but the party turns out awkwardly, due to the Indians&#x27; timidity and the Britons&#x27; bigotry. Also there is Cyril Fielding, principal of Chandrapore&#x27;s government-run college for Indians, who invites Adela and Mrs. Moore to a tea party with him and a Hindu-Brahmin professor named Narayan Godbole. At Adela&#x27;s request, he extends his invitation to Dr. Aziz.

At the party, Fielding and Aziz become friends and Aziz promises to take Mrs. Moore and Adela to see the distant Marabar Caves. Ronny arrives and, finding Adela &quot;unaccompanied&quot; with Dr. Aziz and Professor Godbole, rudely breaks up the party. 

Aziz mistakenly believes that the women are offended that he has not followed through on his promise and arranges an outing to the caves at great expense to himself. Fielding and Godbole are supposed to accompany the expedition, but they miss the train. In the first cave they visit, Mrs. Moore is overcome with claustrophobia and disturbed by the echo. When she declines to continue, Adela and Aziz climb the hill to the upper caves, accompanied by a guide.

Asked by Adela whether he has more than one wife, Aziz is disconcerted by her bluntness and ducks into a cave to compose himself. When he comes out, he is told by the guide that Adela has gone into a cave by herself. After quarreling with the guide, Aziz discovers Adela&#x27;s field glasses broken on the ground and puts them in his pocket. He then looks down the hill and sees Adela speaking to Miss Derek, who has arrived with Fielding in a car. Aziz runs down and greets Fielding, but Miss Derek and Adela drive off, leaving Fielding, Mrs. Moore and Aziz to return to Chandrapore by train. 

Aziz is arrested on arrival and charged with sexually assaulting Adela. The run-up to his trial increases racial tensions. Adela alleges that Aziz followed her into the cave and that she fended him off by swinging her field glasses at him. The only evidence is the field glasses in the possession of Aziz. When Fielding proclaims his belief in Aziz&#x27;s innocence, he is ostracised and condemned as a blood-traitor. 

While awaiting the trial, Mrs Moore becomes concerned at her failing health; taking a ship to England, she dies on the way. Then during the trial, Adela admits that she had been similarly disoriented by the cave&#x27;s echo. She was no longer sure who or what had attacked her and, despite great demand to persist in her accusation, withdraws the charge. When the case is dismissed, Heaslop breaks off his engagement to Adela and she stays at Fielding&#x27;s house until a return to England is arranged. 

Although he is vindicated, Aziz is angry that Fielding befriended Adela after she nearly ruined his life. Believing it to be the gentlemanly thing to do, Fielding convinces Aziz not to seek monetary redress, but the men&#x27;s friendship suffers and Fielding departs for England. Believing that he is leaving to marry Adela for her money, and bitter at his friend&#x27;s perceived betrayal, Aziz vows never again to befriend a white person. 

Two years later, Aziz has moved to the Hindu-ruled state of Mau and is now the Raja&#x27;s chief physician by the time Fielding returns, married to Stella, Mrs. Moore&#x27;s daughter from a second marriage. Though the two meet and Aziz still feels drawn to Fielding, he realises that they cannot be truly friends until India becomes independent from British rule.

== Literary criticism ==

The nature of critiques of &quot;A Passage to India&quot; is largely based upon the era of writing and the nature of the critical work. While many earlier critiques found that Forster&#x27;s book showed an inappropriate friendship between colonizers and the colonized, new critiques on the work draw attention to the depictions of sexism, racism and imperialism in the novel.

Reviews of &quot;A Passage to India&quot; when it was first published challenged specific details and attitudes included in the book that Forster drew from his own time in India. Early critics also expressed concern at the interracial camaraderie between Aziz and Fielding in the book. Others saw the book as a vilification of humanist perspectives on the importance of interpersonal relationships, and effects of colonialism on Indian society. More recent critiques by postcolonial theorists and literary critics have reinvestigated the text as a work of Orientalist fiction contributing to a discourse on colonial relationships by a European. Today it is one of the seminal texts in the postcolonial Orientalist discourse, among other books like &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, by Joseph Conrad, and &quot;Kim&quot;, by Rudyard Kipling.
&quot;A Passage to India&quot; emerged at a time when portrayals of India as a savage, disorganized land in need of domination were more popular in mainstream European literature than romanticized depictions. Forster&#x27;s novel departed from typical narratives about colonizer-colonized relationships and emphasized a more &quot;unknowable&quot; Orient, rather than characterizing it with exoticism, ancient wisdom and mystery. Postcolonial theorists like Maryam Wasif Khan have termed this novel a Modern Orientalist text, meaning that it portrays the Orient in an optimistic, positive light while simultaneously challenging and critiquing European culture and society. However, Benita Parry suggests that it also mystifies India by creating an &quot;obfuscated realm where the secular is scanted, and in which India&#x27;s long traditions of mathematics, science and technology, history, linguistics and jurisprudence have no place.&quot;

One of the most notable critiques comes from literary professor Edward Said, who referenced &quot;A Passage to India&quot; in both &quot;Culture and Imperialism&quot; and &quot;Orientalism&quot;. In his discussion about allusions to the British Empire in early 20th-century novels, Said suggests that though the work subverted typical views on colonialism and colonial rule in India, it also fell short of outright condemning either nationalist movements in India or colonialism itself. Of Forster&#x27;s attitude toward colonizer-colonized relationships, Said says Forster:. . . found a way to use the mechanism of the novel to elaborate on the already existing structure of attitude and reference without changing it. This structure permitted one to feel affection for and even intimacy with some Indians and India generally, but made one see Indian politics as the charge of the British, and culturally refused a privilege to India nationalism.Stereotyping and Orientalist thought is also explored in postcolonial critiques. Said suggests that Forster deals with the question of British-Indian relationships by separating Muslims and Hindus in the narrative. He says Forster connects Islam to Western values and attitudes while suggesting that Hinduism is chaotic and orderless, and subsequently uses Hindu characters as the background to the main narrative. Said also identifies the failed attempt at friendship between Aziz and Fielding as a reinforcement of the perceived cultural distance between the Orient and the West. The inability of the two men to begin a meaningful friendship is indicative of what Said suggests is the irreconcilable otherness of the Orient, something that has originated from the West and also limits Western readers in how they understand the Orient.

Other scholars have examined the book with a critical postcolonial and feminist lens. Maryam Wasif Khan&#x27;s reading of the book suggests &quot;A Passage to India&quot; is also a commentary on gender, and a British woman&#x27;s place within the empire. Khan argued that the female characters coming to &quot;the Orient&quot; to break free of their social roles in Britain represent the discord between Englishwomen and their social roles at home, and tells the narrative of &quot;pioneering Englishwomen whose emergent feminism found form and voice in the colony&quot;.

Sara Suleri has also critiqued the book&#x27;s orientalist depiction of India and its use of racialized bodies, especially in the case of Aziz, as sexual objects rather than individuals.

<text>Places in the Heart is a 1984 American drama film written and directed by Robert Benton. It stars Sally Field, Lindsay Crouse, Ed Harris, Ray Baker, Amy Madigan, John Malkovich, Danny Glover, Jerry Haynes and Terry O&#x27;Quinn. The film follows Edna Spalding, a young woman during the Great Depression in Texas who is forced to take charge of her farm after the death of her husband and is helped by a motley bunch.

&quot;Places in the Heart&quot; premiered at the 35th Berlin International Film Festival, where it competed for the Golden Bear, while Benton won the Silver Bear for Best Director. It was theatrically released on September 21, 1984, by Tri-Star Pictures to critical and commercial success. Reviewers praised Benton&#x27;s screenplay and direction and performances of the cast (particularly of Field, Malkovich and Crouse), while the film grossed $34.9 million against a $9.5 million budget. The film received seven nominations at the 57th Academy Awards including Best Picture and won two: Best Actress (for Field), and Best Original Screenplay.

==Plot==
It&#x27;s 1935 in Waxahachie, Texas, a small town during the Great Depression. One Sunday afternoon, the sheriff, Royce Spalding, goes to investigate gunshots at the rail yards. A cheerfully drunk black teenager, Wylie, is firing a revolver. He reaches an empty chamber and, thinking the gun is empty, he aims at the sheriff, killing him. Royce&#x27;s body is brought home to his widow, Edna, and their children, Frank and Possum. A lynch mob drags Wylie&#x27;s body behind their truck, stopping in front of the Spalding house. Later, Wylie&#x27;s friends take his body down from where he was hanged in a tree. The two men are buried on the same day.

Edna must now raise her children alone. She is comforted by her sister, Margaret, who helps with the funeral. A drifter and handyman, a black man named Moses &quot;Moze&quot; Hadner appears at her door the night of the funeral, asking for work. He offers to plant cotton on her 30 acres, citing his experience. Edna feeds him and sends him on his way. The next morning, she finds him chopping wood in her yard. She makes him breakfast. Moze steals some silver spoons and goes.

The bank has a note on the family farm, and the price of cotton is plummeting. The local banker, Albert Denby, insists she needs to sell the farm.

When the police find Moze with her silver, they bring him back to confirm the theft, Edna says she has hired him and explains the spoons. The next day, Edna tells Denby she will not sell the farm. He is appalled that she is taking advice from a black man. Later, he visits the farm and forces her to take his brother-in-law, Will, blinded in World War I, as a paid lodger.

Frank gets caught smoking at school. Edna is forced into yet another male role previously performed by her husband, as she must punish Frank. Edna gathers instructions from Frank as to the way she should spank him; she hesitates, then delivers the punishment while Will and Possum empathize from outside. Frank takes his spanking bravely, while Moze takes Possum outside after Frank runs to his room. Edna confides to Will that she will not do this again and that she dearly misses her husband.

Will is slow to warm up to Edna&#x27;s children, but they eventually become close. He rescues her daughter, Possum, during a tornado that levels part of town but leaves the Spalding house standing.

Wayne Lomax, Edna&#x27;s brother-in-law, has a fine time making love to married schoolteacher Viola Kelsey. The tornado is the last straw for Viola, who tells her husband they must move. Wayne admits the affair to Margaret. She says she won&#x27;t forgive him this time.

Edna realizes she cannot make the next payment even if she sells all her cotton. She learns of an Ellis County contest: a $100 cash prize to the farmer who produces the first bale of cotton for the market each season. Edna realizes the prize money plus the proceeds from the sale of her cotton would be enough to save the farm. Moze helps her find the pickers they need to harvest the cotton on time.

Their efforts pay off. Edna and Moze find themselves first in line at the wholesaler with the season&#x27;s first bale of cotton. Moze carefully coaches Edna on how to negotiate with the buyer, and as a result, he is unable to cheat her. Edna makes plans for the future. Moze is excited, but that night, he is assaulted by Ku Klux Klan members. Wielding Royce&#x27;s gun, Will interrupts the savage beating. He recognizes all the assailants&#x27; voices and identifies them. They leave. Weeping, Moze realizes he must leave the farm or die. He gives Edna a handkerchief that belonged to his mother.

The film ends in a dreamlike scene evoking Holy Communion. A choir sings in the modest church, where the pews are mostly empty. During a reading of 1 Corinthians 13, Margaret takes Wayne&#x27;s hand. The congregation, after filling the pews, partakes in Protestant communion, passing the elements of the sacrifice to each other as the choir sings &quot;In the Garden&quot;. The camera shows townspeople in the pews who were seen throughout the film, including a woman who died when the tornado overturned her car. Eventually, Moze is shown in the church, though he is long gone; the camera then shows Edna, who passes a communion tray to her dead husband, quietly saying &quot;Peace of God&quot;; with the same blessing, he hands it to Wylie, who shot him and was killed in revenge. After Wylie replies, &quot;Peace of God&quot;, the camera lingers on the two men in contemplation as the hymn ends.

Regarding the unique ending, writer-director Robert Benton explained why he ended an otherwise realistic movie with a fantasy scene incorporating equality, grace and forgiveness, tenets of Christianity:

&quot;There are certain things images can explain that words cannot. There is something in the image of the man who has been killed handing the communion plate to the boy who killed him that seems very moving to me in ways I cannot explain. I had the ending before I ever finished the screenplay, although I knew audiences would be confused by it.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Places in the Heart&quot; was released in theatres on September 21, 1984. The film was released on DVD on October 9, 2001, by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Places in the Heart&quot; grossed $274,279 in its opening weekend. The film grossed $34.9 million in the US.

===Critical response===
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 89% based on reviews from 38 critics and a rating average of 8.00/10. The consensus is: &quot;&quot;Places in the Heart&quot; is a quiet character piece with grand ambitions that it more than fulfills, thanks to absorbing work from writer-director Robert Benton and a tremendous cast.&quot; Metacritic gives the film a score of 70% based on reviews from 12 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in his review: &quot;Robert Benton has made one of the best films in years about growing up American.&quot; Canby called it &quot;moving and often funny&quot; and &quot;a tonic, a revivifying experience right down to the final images&quot;, comparing it to Luis Buñuel&#x27;s &quot;Tristana&quot;&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film three of four stars, writing that Benton&#x27;s &quot;memories provide the material for a wonderful movie, and he has made it, but unfortunately he hasn&#x27;t stopped at that. He has gone on to include too much. He tells a central story of great power, and then keeps leaving it to catch us up with minor characters we never care about.&quot;

===Accolades===
In 1985, when Sally Field accepted her second Academy Award for Best Actress (the first was for &quot;Norma Rae&quot;), she uttered the memorable (and much-mocked) line &quot;I can&#x27;t deny the fact that you like me—&quot;right now, you&quot; like me!&quot; It is commonly misquoted as &quot;You like me—you &quot;really&quot; like me!&quot;

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:

<doc id="113451" wikidata="Q1624196" url="?curid=113451" title="A Soldier's Story">
<text>A Soldier&#x27;s Story is a 1984 American mystery drama film directed and produced by Norman Jewison, adapted by Charles Fuller from his Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Play&quot;. It is a murder mystery set in a segregated regiment of the U.S Army commanded by White officers and training in the Jim Crow South. In a time and place where a Black commissioned officer is bitterly resented by nearly everyone, an African-American JAG captain investigates the murder of an African-American drill sergeant in Louisiana following American entry into World War II. As the investigation proceeds, the events leading up to the sergeant&#x27;s murder are shown in flashbacks.

The cast is led by Howard Rollins and Adolph Caesar. Other actors include Art Evans, David Alan Grier, Larry Riley, David Harris, Robert Townsend, and Patti LaBelle. Denzel Washington, still at the beginning of his career, appears in a supporting role. Several actors reprise their roles from the stage version.

The film premiered at the 1984 Toronto International Film Festival and was both a critical and commercial success. It received three Academy Award nominations: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor for Adolph Caesar. The film was ranked by the National Board of Review as one of the 10 best films of 1984, and it won the Golden Prize at the 14th Moscow International Film Festival.

==Plot==
In 1944 during World War II, Vernon Waters, a master sergeant in a company of Black soldiers, is shot to death with a .45 caliber pistol outside Fort Neal, a segregated Army base in Louisiana. Captain Richard Davenport, a Black officer from the Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps, is sent to investigate. Most assume Waters was killed by the local Ku Klux Klan, but others are doubtful.

Even Captain Taylor, the only White officer who wants the killers prosecuted, is uncooperative and patronizing, fearing a Black officer will have little success. Davenport soon discovers that whenever the Klan murders Black soldiers, they strip them of their military insignia, whereas the body of Sgt. Waters was found wearing an intact uniform.

Davenport learns that Waters&#x27;s company was officially part of the 221st Chemical Smoke Generator Battalion. They are kept on the Home Front and assigned menial jobs. Most are former players from the Negro baseball league, grouped to play ball with Waters as manager.

Private James Wilkie, a former sergeant Waters busted for being drunk on duty, describes Waters as a combat veteran who was awarded with the Croix de Guerre by the Third French Republic during the First World War. He also says that Waters was a strict disciplinarian but a fair NCO who got on well with his men, especially baseball pitcher and jazz musician C.J. Memphis.

Private Peterson reveals Waters&#x27;s tyrannical nature and his disgust with Black soldiers from the rural South who lacked education, or who spoke in Gullah language. Peterson also recalls how he beat up Waters when the sergeant berated the men after a winning game. Interviewing other soldiers, Davenport learns that Waters charged Memphis with the murder of a White MP after a search conducted by Wilkie turned up a recently discharged pistol under his bunk. Waters provoked Memphis into hitting him, and while the murder charge was dismissed, he was charged with striking a superior officer.

Davenport next interrogates Memphis&#x27;s best friend Corporal Bernard Cobb. Cobb recalls visiting Memphis in the brig, where he told Cobb of a visit in which Waters admitted the planted gun was part of a frame-up. Waters viewed &quot;Geechees&quot;, as he termed uneducated southern Blacks like Memphis, as an obstacle to racial equality and the success of the future African American upper class. Davenport also learns from Cobb that Memphis, who suffered from claustrophobia, hanged himself while awaiting his court-martial. In protest, the baseball team threw the season&#x27;s last game. Taylor disbanded the team, and the players were reassigned to the 221st.

Davenport learns that racist White officers Captain Wilcox and Lieutenant Byrd had an altercation with Waters shortly before his death. While being interrogated by Davenport and Taylor at the officer&#x27;s club, Wilcox and Byrd admit to assaulting a guilt-ridden Waters after he confronted them in a drunken tirade. They admit that they would have killed him, but only men on guard duty are issued .45 ammunition when the unit is on bivouac. Immediately after learning of Waters&#x27;s murder, both officers turned in their side-arms, and ballistics testing cleared them.

Davenport interrogates Wilkie, who admits he planted the gun under Memphis&#x27;s bunk on Waters&#x27;s orders. Wilkie also reveals that Waters had told him the real reasons for his hatred of Gullah-speaking southern Blacks like Memphis. While serving with the AEF in France during World War I, a Black soldier in Waters&#x27;s unit had, at the urging of racist White Doughboys, humiliated them all by dressing up and acting like a monkey in front of the French girls at a cabaret. In retaliation, Waters and his enraged fellow Black Doughboys slit the soldier&#x27;s throat.

Davenport demands to know why Waters did not also frame Peterson after their fight. Wilkie explains that Waters liked Peterson, as he spoke proper English and stood up for himself. Davenport has Wilkie arrested just as the 221st is about to be shipped out to join the fight overseas.

Realizing Peterson and Smalls were on guard duty the night of the murder and thus had been issued .45 ammunition, Davenport interrogates Smalls. He confesses to watching as Peterson fatally shot Waters, claiming it was &quot;justice&quot; for Memphis and for all Black people.

Taylor congratulates Davenport on the arrests of Wilkie, Peterson, and Smalls, admitting that he will have to get used to Negroes being commissioned officers. Meanwhile, the platoon marches in preparation for their deployment to the European theater of war.

==Production==

Jewison and many of the cast members worked for scale or less under a tight budget with Columbia Pictures. &quot;No one really wanted to make this movie... a black story, it was based on World War II, and those themes were not popular at the box office&quot;, according to Jewison. Warner Bros. turned it down, as did Universal and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Columbia&#x27;s Frank Price read the screenplay and was deeply interested, but the studio was hesitant about its commercial value, so Jewison offered to do the film for a $5 million budget and no salary. When the Directors Guild of America insisted he must have a fee, he agreed to take the lowest possible amount. The film ended up grossing $22.1 million.

Howard E. Rollins, Jr. had just received an Oscar nomination for his role in &quot;Ragtime&quot; and was cast as the lead. Most of the cast came from Broadway careers, but only Adolph Caesar, Denzel Washington, Larry Riley and William Allen Young appeared in both the movie and the original off-Broadway play with the Negro Ensemble Company in the New York City version.

In a 1985 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Caesar stated, while crafting the character of Waters, he drew on his frustrating experiences with both racism and ignorance in Classical theatre, &quot;I’d studied Shakespeare to death. I knew more about Shakespeare than Shakespeare knew about himself. After I did one season at a Shakespearean repertory company, a director said to me, ‘You have a marvelous voice. You know the king’s English well. You speak iambic pentameter. My suggestion is that you go to New York and get a good colored role.&#x27; Waters has tried his best, but no matter what you do, they still hate you.&quot;

&quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Story&quot; was shot entirely in Arkansas. The &quot;Tynin&quot; exterior scenes were shot in three days in Clarendon. The baseball sequence was filmed in Little Rock at the historic Lamar Porter Field.

Bill Clinton (then Governor of Arkansas) dropped by during the shooting. He became very enthused about the project and later helped by providing the Arkansas Army National Guard in full regalia for a grand scene, since Jewison could not afford to pay an army of extras. Production was completed with their help at Fort Chaffee United States Army Ready Reserve base at Fort Smith.

Fuller had said Herman Melville&#x27;s novella &quot;Billy Budd&quot; inspired the play.

==Reception==
The film holds a 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from a sample of 22 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;A meticulously crafted murder mystery with incisive observations about race in America, &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Story&quot; benefits from a roundly excellent ensemble and Charles Fuller&#x27;s politically urgent screenplay&quot;.

<doc id="113452" wikidata="Q1215865" url="?curid=113452" title="Kiss of the Spider Woman (1985 film)">
<text>Kiss of the Spider Woman () is a 1985 drama film directed by Héctor Babenco from a screenplay by Leonard Schrader, based on the 1976 novel of the same name by Manuel Puig. It stars William Hurt, Raul Julia, Sônia Braga, José Lewgoy, Milton Gonçalves, and Denise Dumont.

Set in a Brazilian prison during the military dictatorship, the film centers on a dialogue between two very different cellmates, a hardened leftist revolutionary (Julia) and an apolitical gay man (Hurt). The story utilizes metafictional and film-within-a-film elements, as the latter regales the former with retellings of an old movie, whose themes mirror those of the characters.

Independently produced, principal photography occurred in São Paulo between October 1983 and March 1984.

&quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot; premiered on May 13, 1985, at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival, where Hurt won the Best Actor award and Babenco was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or. The film was released in the United States on July 26, 1985, and in Brazil on March 13, 1986. It received critical acclaim; Hurt won the Academy Award and BAFTA for Best Actor, and the film received a further three Academy Award nominations, for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. It was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama, in addition to Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama (Hurt and Julia) and Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture (Braga).

==Plot==
The film centers on a dialogue between two very different individuals who share a prison cell in Brazil during the Brazilian military dictatorship: Valentin Arregui, who is imprisoned (and has been tortured) due to his activities on behalf of a leftist revolutionary group, and Luis Molina, a gay man in prison for &quot;corrupting an underage youth.&quot;

Molina passes the time by recounting memories from one of his favorite films, a wartime romantic thriller that is also a Nazi propaganda film. He weaves the characters into a narrative meant to comfort Valentin and distract him from the harsh realities of political imprisonment and separation from his lover, Marta. Valentin encourages Molina to have self-respect and opens him up to political commitment. Despite Valentin&#x27;s occasionally snapping at Molina over his shallow views of film-watching and unrealistic romance, an unlikely friendship develops between the two.

As the story develops, it becomes clear that Valentin is being poisoned by his jailers to provide Molina with a chance to befriend him, and that Molina is spying on Valentin on behalf of the secret police. Molina has apparently been promised parole if he succeeds in obtaining information that will allow the secret police to break up the revolutionary group.

When Molina declares himself in love with Valentin, a physical consummation of that love occurs on Molina&#x27;s last night in prison. Molina is granted parole in a surprise move by the secret police. Valentin provides Molina with a telephone number and a message for his comrades. Molina at first refuses to take the number, fearing the consequences of treason, but he relents, bidding Valentin farewell with a kiss.

Now out of prison, Molina calls the telephone number, and a meeting is arranged with the revolutionary group. But the secret police have had Molina under surveillance, and at the rendezvous, a gun battle occurs, with the revolutionaries shooting Molina. As he wanders the streets wounded, the secret police catch him and demand the telephone number, but Molina refuses and dies. On the orders of the police chief, the policemen dump Molina&#x27;s body in a rubbish pit and fabricate a story about his death and his presumed collaboration with the revolutionary group.

In the prison, Valentin is being treated after being tortured. After a sympathetic doctor risks his job by administering morphine to help him sleep, Valentin appears to succumb to his wounds and perhaps die, when he suddenly finds himself running out of prison with Marta and appearing on an idyllic tropical island with her. Valentin and Marta sail away on a boat into the distance.

==Cast==
==Background==
The film is based on the 1976 novel &quot;El beso de la mujer araña&quot; (&quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot;) by Manuel Puig. The Argentine author was the first to adapt his own novel as a stage play. A Broadway musical of the same name, also based on the novel, was produced in 1993.

==Production==

=== Development ===
As noted in Puig&#x27;s 2001 biography, &quot;Manuel Puig and the Spider Woman: His Life and Fictions,&quot; the novel was banned in Argentina, and the English translation edition preceded a widespread publication in Spanish. The novel was considered for a film adaptation by Rainer Werner Fassbinder and other directors. In 1981, Argentine-born director Héctor Babenco was in Los Angeles, to accept an award from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association for his breakout feature film, &quot;Pixote&quot;. At the reception, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Kevin Thomas asked Babenco about his future projects, and the director mentioned his desire to adapt Puig&#x27;s novel, starring Burt Lancaster. The actor was in attendance at the event, and Thomas introduced him to Babenco.

When Lancaster expressed interest, Babenco initially doubted his seriousness, but promised to send him a copy of the novel. Several days later, Lancaster&#x27;s assistant telephoned Babenco to make sure &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot; was in the mail, and the director sent it right away. The two met in the coming weeks at the New York Critics’ award ceremony, and Lancaster committed to the role of Molina.

Babenco met American producer David Weisman in early 1982 through a mutual friend to discuss bringing “Latin American magical realism” into the mainstream&quot;.&quot; Although Lancaster was attached&quot;,&quot; giving it built-in marketability, the novel&#x27;s non-traditional narrative made it a challenge to adapt, and its homosexual theme was perceived as a detriment to attracting mainstream audiences. Babenco, who was an expatriate in Brazil at that time, feared a xenophobic backlash against the production for casting American actors. Additional obstacles to the production included Manuel Puig&#x27;s antagonism toward Babenco; he did not like &quot;Pixote,&quot; and suspected the director was an “opportunist.”

=== Pre-production ===
Babenco continued to develop the property despite the author&#x27;s misgivings, and attracted potential investors, including German filmmaker Frank Ripploh. Richard Gere was set to play Valentin, giving the production further box-office credibility&quot;.&quot; New York City socialite Jane Holzer, who appeared in several Andy Warhol films and was an acquaintance of David Weisman, agreed to finance initial production costs, and Leonard Schrader, who had collaborated with his brother, Paul Schrader, on &quot;The Yakuza&quot;, was hired to write the script. However, Babenco remained wary of anglicizing the source material, and was relieved by the casting of Puerto Rican actor Raul Julia, who replaced Richard Gere.

Meanwhile, rumors circulated in the press that Lancaster had a penchant for cross-dressing, and Babenco attempted to dispel the scandal at the Cannes Film Festival by telling a French gay tabloid that he did not know Lancaster was homosexual when he was cast&quot;.&quot; Although Babenco intended to imply that Lancaster was not gay, and his sexual orientation had nothing to do with the actor&#x27;s involvement with the film, his statement was taken out of context when it was published, and prompted further inquisition into Lancaster&#x27;s personal life. This, along with Lancaster&#x27;s advancing age, and a heart bypass operation in Apr 1983, caused the production to be delayed, and the filmmakers turned to William Hurt as a replacement. The morning after Hurt consented to the role, Weisman and Babenco met with independent producer Ray Stark, whose company, Rastar, had been acquired by Columbia Pictures. Stark agreed to take on the project at that time, but neither he nor Columbia are credited onscreen.

The picture&#x27;s expected $1.5 million budget was financed in part by Brazil&#x27;s Embrafilme, which purchased Brazilian distribution rights for $160,000. Below-the-line expenses were raised by Babenco&#x27;s HB Filmes, and international production services were funded by Weisman&#x27;s Sugarloaf Films, Inc. The crew was mainly Brazilian, accompanied by several Argentine-born craftsmen&quot;.&quot; Rehearsals took place in a São Paulo prison that had been vacated in the wake of riots, and sets were constructed at Vera Cruz Studios, which had been abandoned due to bankruptcy.

=== Writing ===
The film&#x27;s setting was relocated from Argentina to Brazil, with the added political context of the then-current Brazilian military dictatorship.

The story features a &quot;film within a film&quot;, featuring Luis Molina episodically telling Valentin Arregui the plot of a fictional film called &quot;Her Real Glory&quot; ostensibly produced in Germany during Second World War by the Nazis.

While the book alludes to five motion pictures, the film version focuses on a single Nazi propaganda movie. Puig biographer Suzanne Jill Levine identified the film as a compilation of various Third Reich productions with the American &quot;Paris Underground&quot; and &quot;Die große Liebe&quot; &quot;(The Great Love),&quot; a 1942 film starring Zarah Leander as a cabaret singer who falls in love with a German air force pilot. Leander was the model for the &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman’s&quot; “Leni Lamaison,” who was named after propaganda filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography began October 13, 1983 in São Paulo, Brazil. Since Babenco &quot;rarely&quot; spoke English, Hurt took direction from him via an assistant director. Hurt and Julia had agreed to work for the Screen Actors Guild pay scale, and deferred the greater portion of their salaries for a profit-share in the sale of the film&#x27;s distribution rights, as well as its box-office gross. While Babenco and Weisman were also working for the same “deferred investment plan,” other players, including actress Sônia Braga, opted to be paid upfront. During filming in Brazil, Hurt and a friend were threatened at gunpoint but were let go several hours later.

== Release ==
=== Critical response ===
The film received positive reviews. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives it a rating of 86% based on reviews from 36 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus states; &quot;&quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot; weaves an alluring exploration of sexual and societal norms that&#x27;s further elevated by strong work from William Hurt and Raul Julia.&quot; 

Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars out of four, calling it a &quot;film of insights and surprises&quot; and remarking that &quot;the performances are wonderful.&quot; James Berardinelli gave &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot; three stars out of four, calling it &quot;a fascinating character study.&quot; Reviewing the film in 2009, Berardinelli claimed that it &quot;has lost none of its power over the years,&quot; and felt that while it was not the best film of 1985, it was more deserving of the Best Picture Academy Award than &quot;Out of Africa&quot;.

In 2015, the Brazilian Film Critics Association voted &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot; the 61st greatest Brazilian film of all time, in its list of the 100 best Brazilian films.

=== Home media ===
The DVD version contains a bonus disc with a 108-minute documentary (accessible in English via subtitles) &quot;Tangled Web: Making &#x27;Kiss of the Spider Woman&#x27; &quot; (2008). The documentary treats the making of the film, the careers of the writers, actors and producers, and the post-production history of the film.

== Accolades ==
William Hurt won the Academy Award for Best Actor. The film was also nominated for Best Picture (the first independently produced film that was), Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. Hurt also won Best Actor at the BAFTA Awards, the 1985 Cannes Film Festival and several other festivals. The film was awarded the inaugural Golden Space Needle award from the Seattle International Film Festival. Hurt and Julia won a joint award for Best Actor from the National Board of Review.

==Musical film adaptation==

In December 2023, Jennifer Lopez was announced to star in a film adaptation of Terrence McNally, John Kander and Fred Ebb&#x27;s 1992 Broadway musical adaptation of the novel with Bill Condon as writer and director. The independently financed production will be executive produced by Lopez, Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas and Benny Medina through their Nuyorican Productions banner, while Barry Josephson, Tom Kirdahy, Greg Yolen and Matt Geller will serve as producers and Sergio Trujillo will choreograph the musical sequences. Upon the announcement, a casting call opened for an unknown to play the role of Molina. Filming began in New Jersey in March 2024. In April 2024, Diego Luna and Tonatiuh joined the cast as Valentin and Molina respectively, with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon joining the producing team under their Artists Equity banner. It premiered at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 2025 to a standing ovation from the audience.

<text>The 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) (&quot;Screaming Eagles&quot;) is a light infantry division of the United States Army that specializes in air assault operations. The 101st is designed to plan, coordinate, and execute brigade-sized air assault operations that can be conducted in one period of darkness, at distances up to 500 nautical miles, to seize key terrain and hold it for up to 14 days. In recent years, the 101st was active in foreign internal defense and counterterrorism operations in Iraq, in Afghanistan in 2015–2016, and in Syria, as part of Operation Inherent Resolve in 2018–2021.

Established in 1918, the 101st Division was first constituted as an airborne unit in 1942. During World War II, it gained renown for its role in Operation Overlord (the D-Day landings and airborne landings on 6 June 1944, in Normandy, France); Operation Market Garden; the liberation of the Netherlands; and its action during the Battle of the Bulge around the city of Bastogne, Belgium. During the Vietnam War, the 101st Airborne Division fought in several major campaigns and battles, including the Battle of Hamburger Hilland the Battle of Fire Base Ripcord 1969-1970. In mid-1968, the division was reorganized and redesignated as an airmobile division and in 1974, the division was again redesigned as an air assault division. The titles reflect the division&#x27;s shift from airplanes to helicopters as the primary method of delivering troops into combat.

At the height of the War on Terror, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) had over 200 aircraft. This shrank to just over 100 aircraft with the inactivation of the 159th Combat Aviation Brigade in 2015. In 2019, media reports suggested the Army was working to restore the 101st&#x27;s aviation capabilities so it can return to lifting an entire brigade in one air assault operation.

The 101st&#x27;s headquarters is at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Many members of the 101st are graduates of the U.S. Army Air Assault School, which is co-located with the division. The school is known as one of the Army&#x27;s most difficult courses; only about half of those who begin it will graduate.

The Screaming Eagles was referred to as &quot;the tip of the spear&quot; by former U.S. Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, and the most potent and tactically mobile of the U.S. Army&#x27;s divisions by General Edward C. Meyer, then Chief of Staff of the Army.

==History==
=== World War I ===

On 23 July 1918, the War Department directed the organization of the 101st Division in the National Army at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, under the supervision of camp commander Brigadier General Roy Hoffman. Plans called for the division to include a headquarters, headquarters troop, the 201st Infantry Brigade (401st and 402nd Infantry Regiments and 377th Machine Gun Battalion), 202nd Infantry Brigade (403rd and 404th Infantry Regiments and 378th Machine Gun Battalion), 376th Machine Gun Battalion, 176th Field Artillery Brigade (376th-378th Field Artillery Regiments and 27th Trench Mortar Battery), 326th Engineers, 626th Field Signal Battalion, and 326th Train Headquarters and Military Police (Ammunition, Engineer, Sanitary, and Supply Trains). It was intended that the 201st Infantry Brigade would be organized in France from the 58th and 59th Pioneer Infantry Regiments.

The 27th Trench Mortar Battery was formed at Camp Bowie, Texas, in August 1918 and was assigned to the 176th Field Artillery Brigade, but never ended up joining. The organization of the division began in October and Colonel Patrick H. Mullay was named division chief of staff on 2 November, but organization never progressed beyond the formation of the division headquarters and preliminary preparations for the receipt of Selective Service men. After the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the 101st Division was ordered demobilized on 30 November 1918, being completed on 11 December.

===Interwar period ===

In 1921, pursuant to the National Defense Act of 1920, the 101st Division was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve, allotted to the Sixth Corps Area, and assigned to the XVI Corps, and further allotted to the state of Wisconsin. The division headquarters was organized on 10 September 1921 in Room 412 of the Federal Building in Milwaukee, moving in July 1922 to the Pereles Building, where it remained until activated for World War II. The designated mobilization and training station for the division was Camp Custer, Michigan, where much of the division&#x27;s annual training activities occurred in the interwar years. The headquarters and staff usually trained with the staff of the 12th Infantry Brigade either at Camp Custer or Fort Sheridan, Illinois, while the infantry regiments trained primarily with the 2nd Infantry Regiment at Camp Custer. The special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster units trained at various posts in the Sixth and Seventh Corps Areas. In addition, division personnel also conducted the Citizens&#x27; Military Training Camps in the division&#x27;s home area as an alternate form of annual training. The division&#x27;s primary &quot;feeder&quot; schools for newly commissioned Reserve lieutenants were the University of Wisconsin, Ripon College, and St. Norbert College.

Division personnel sometimes participated in the Sixth Corps Area and Second Army command post exercises with other Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve units, but the division did not participate as a unit in the various Sixth Corps Area maneuvers and the Second Army maneuvers of 1937, 1940, and 1941, because of a lack of enlisted personnel and equipment to use. Instead, the officers and a few enlisted reservists were assigned to Regular Army and National Guard units to fill vacant slots, and some officers were assigned duties as umpires or support personnel.

It was at this time that the &quot;Screaming Eagle&quot; mascot became associated with the division, as a successor to the traditions of the Wisconsin volunteer regiments of the American Civil War.

=== World War II and Cold War era ===


On 30 July 1942, the Army Ground Forces ordered the activation of two airborne divisions by 15 August 1942. The 82nd Division, an Organized Reserve division ordered into active military service in March 1942, was ordered to provide cadre to the 101st Division, the other division that was selected for the project, for all elements except parachute infantry. As part of the reorganization of the 101st Division as an airborne division, the unit was disbanded in the Organized Reserve on 15 August 1942 and reconstituted and reactivated in the Army of the United States. On 19 August 1942, its first commander, Major General William C. Lee, read out General Order Number 5:

The 101st Airborne Division, which was activated on 16 August 1942, at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana, has no history, but it has a rendezvous with destiny.
Due to the nature of our armament, and the tactics in which we shall perfect ourselves, we shall be called upon to carry out operations of far-reaching military importance and we shall habitually go into action when the need is immediate and extreme. Let me call your attention to the fact that our badge is the great American eagle. This is a fitting emblem for a division that will crush its enemies by falling upon them like a thunderbolt from the skies.
The history we shall make, the record of high achievement we hope to write in the annals of the American Army and the American people, depends wholly and completely on the men of this division. Each individual, each officer and each enlisted man, must therefore regard himself as a necessary part of a complex and powerful instrument for the overcoming of the enemies of the nation. Each, in his own job, must realize that he is not only a means, but an indispensable means for obtaining the goal of victory. It is, therefore, not too much to say that the future itself, in whose molding we expect to have our share, is in the hands of the soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division.

==== Operation Overlord ====

The pathfinders of the 101st Airborne Division led the way on D-Day in the night drop before the invasion. They left from RAF North Witham, having trained there with the 82nd Airborne Division. These night drops caused a lot of trouble for the gliders. Many crashed and equipment and personnel were lost.

The 101st Airborne Division&#x27;s objectives were to secure the four causeway exits behind Utah Beach between Saint-Martin-de-Varreville and Pouppeville to ensure the exit route for the 4th Infantry Division from the beach later that morning. The other objectives included destroying a German coastal artillery battery at Saint-Martin-de-Varreville, capturing buildings nearby at Mézières believed used as barracks and a command post for the artillery battery, capturing the Douve river lock at La Barquette (opposite Carentan), capturing two footbridges spanning the Douve at La Porte opposite Brévands, destroying the highway bridges over the Douve at Saint-Côme-du-Mont, and securing the Douve River valley. Their secondary mission was to protect the southern flank of VII Corps. They destroyed two bridges along the Carentan highway and a railroad bridge just west of it. They gained control of La Barquette locks, and established a bridgehead over the Douve which was located north-east of Carentan.

In the process, units also disrupted German communications, established roadblocks to hamper the movement of German reinforcements, established a defensive line between the beachhead and Valognes, cleared the area of the drop zones to the unit boundary at Les Forges, and linked up with the 82nd Airborne Division.

===== Drop Zone Able =====
The paratroopers of the 101st Airborne Division jumped between 00:48 and 01:40 British Double Summer Time of 6 June. The first wave, inbound to Drop Zone A (the northernmost), was not surprised by the cloud bank and maintained formation, but navigating errors and a lack of Eureka signal caused the first error. Although the 2nd Battalion, 502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment was dropped as a compact unit, it jumped on the wrong drop zone, while its commander, Lt. Col. Steve A. Chappuis, came down virtually alone on the correct drop zone. Chappuis and his paratrooper captured the coastal battery soon after assembling, and found that it had already been dismantled after an air raid.

Most of the remainder of the 502nd (70 of 80 paratroopers) dropped in a disorganized pattern around the impromptu drop zone set up by the pathfinders near the beach. The battalion commanders of the 1st and 3rd Battalions, Lt. Col. Patrick J. Cassidy (1/502) and Lt. Col. Robert G. Cole (3/502), took charge of small groups and accomplished all of their D-Day missions. Cassidy&#x27;s group took Saint Martin-de-Varreville by 06:30, sent a patrol under S/Sgt. Harrison C. Summers to seize the &quot;XYZ&quot; objective, a barracks at Mésières, and set up a thin line of defense from Foucarville to Beuzeville. Cole&#x27;s group moved during the night from near Sainte-Mère-Église to the Varreville battery, then continued on and captured Exit 3 at 07:30. They held the position during the morning until relieved by troops moving inland from Utah Beach. Both commanders found Exit 4 covered by German artillery fire and Cassidy recommended to the 4th Infantry Division that it not use the exit.

The division&#x27;s parachute artillery did not fare nearly as well. Its drop was one of the worst of the operation, losing all but one howitzer and dropping all but two of 54 loads four to to the north, where most ultimately became casualties.

===== Drop Zone Charlie =====
The second wave, assigned to drop the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR) on Drop Zone C west of Sainte Marie-du-Mont, was badly dispersed by the clouds, then subjected to intense anti-aircraft fire for . Three of the 81 C-47s were lost before or during the jump. One, piloted by 1st Lt. Marvin F. Muir of the 439th Troop Carrier Group, caught fire. Muir held the aircraft steady while the stick jumped, then died when the plane crashed immediately afterward, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Despite the opposition, the 506th&#x27;s 1st Battalion (the original division reserve) was dropped accurately on DZ C, landing two-thirds of its sticks and regimental commander Col. Robert F. Sink on or within a mile of the drop zone.

Most of the 2nd Battalion had jumped too far west, near Sainte-Mère-Église. They eventually assembled near Foucarville at the northern edge of the 101st Airborne&#x27;s objective area. It fought its way to the hamlet of Le Grand Chemin near the Houdienville causeway by mid-afternoon, but found that the 4th Division had already seized the exit hours before. The 3rd Battalion of the 501st PIR, led by Lt. Col. Julian J. Ewell (3/501), also assigned to jump onto DZ C, was more scattered, but took over the mission of securing the exits. An ad hoc company-sized team that included division commander Maj. Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor reached the Pouppeville exit at 06:00. After a six-hour house-clearing battle with elements of the German 1058th Grenadier Regiment, the group secured the exit shortly before 4th Division troops arrived to link up.

===== Drop Zone Dog =====
The third wave also encountered severe flak, losing six aircraft. The troop carriers still made an accurate drop, placing 94 of 132 sticks on or close to the drop zone, but part of the DZ was covered by pre-registered German machine gun and mortar fire that inflicted heavy casualties before many troops could get out of their chutes. Among the killed were two of the three battalion commanders and the executive officer of the 3/506th.

The surviving battalion commander, Lt. Col. Robert A. Ballard, gathered 250 troopers and advanced toward Saint Côme-du-Mont to complete his mission of destroying the highway bridges over the Douve. Less than half a mile from his objective at les Droueries he was stopped by elements of battalion III/1058 Grenadier-Rgt. Another group of 50 men, assembled by the regimental S-3, Major Richard J. Allen, attacked the same area from the east at Basse-Addeville but was also pinned down.

The commander of the 501st PIR, Col. Howard R. Johnson, collected 150 troops and captured the main objective, la Barquette lock, by 04:00. After establishing defensive positions, Col. Johnson went back to the DZ and assembled another 100 men, including Allen&#x27;s group, to reinforce the bridgehead. Despite naval gunfire support from the cruiser , Ballard&#x27;s battalion was unable to take Saint Côme-du-Mont or join Col. Johnson.

The S-3 officer of the 3rd Battalion 506th PIR, Capt. Charles G. Shettle, put together a platoon and achieved another objective by seizing two foot bridges near la Porte at 04:30 and crossed to the east bank. When their ammunition drew low after knocking out several machine gun emplacements, the small force withdrew to the west bank. It doubled in size overnight as stragglers came in and repulsed a German probe across the bridges.

===== Other actions =====
Two other noteworthy actions took place near Sainte Marie-du-Mont by units of the 506th PIR, both of which involved the seizure and destruction of batteries of 105 mm guns of the German III Battalion-191st Artillery Regiment. During the morning, a small patrol of troopers from Company E 506th PIR under (then) 1st Lt. Richard D. Winters overwhelmed a force 3–4 times its size and destroyed four guns at a farm called Brécourt Manor, for which Winters was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and the assault troops given Silver and Bronze Stars. This was later documented in the book &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; and the miniseries of the same name.
Around noon, while reconnoitering the area by jeep, Col. Sink received word that a second battery of four guns had been discovered at Holdy, a manor between his CP and Sainte Marie-du-Mont, and the defenders had a force of some 70 paratroopers pinned down. Capt. Lloyd E. Patch (Headquarters Company 1st/506th) and Capt. Knut H. Raudstein (Company C 506th PIR) led an additional 70 troops to Holdy and enveloped the position. The combined force then continued on to seize Sainte Marie-du-Mont. A platoon of the 502nd PIR, left to hold the battery, destroyed three of the four guns before Col. Sink could send four jeeps to save them for the 101st&#x27;s use.

At the end of D-Day, Gen. Taylor and division artillery commander Brig. Gen. Anthony C. McAuliffe returned from their foray at Pouppeville. Taylor had control of approximately 2,500 of his 6,600 men, most of whom were in the vicinity of the 506th CP at Culoville, with the thin defense line west of Saint Germain-du-Varreville, or the division reserve at Blosville. Two glider airlifts had brought in scant reinforcements and had resulted in the death of his assistant division commander (ADC), Brig. Gen. Don F. Pratt, his neck broken on impact. The 327th Glider Infantry had come across Utah Beach but only its third battalion (1st Battalion 401st GIR) had reported in.

The 101st Airborne Division had accomplished its most important mission of securing the beach exits, but had a tenuous hold on positions near the Douve River, over which the Germans could still move armored units. The three groups clustered there had tenuous contact with each other but none with the rest of the division. A shortage of radio equipment caused by losses during the drops exacerbated his control problems. Taylor made destroying the Douve bridges the division&#x27;s top priority and delegated the task to Sink, who issued orders for the 1st Battalion 401st Glider Infantry to lead three battalions south the next morning.

===== Carentan =====
On 10 June the division launched an assault to seize the town of Carentan, a major road and rail hub that served as a critical junction between Utah and Omaha beaches. As such Carentan was heavily defended by the 2nd Fallschirmjäger-Division, 91st Luftlande-Infanterie-Division and elements of the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division. Deliberate flooding of the Douve River floodplain north of the town left the elevated causeway linking Saint-Côme-du-Mont and Carentan, later named Purple Heart Lane, as the most expedient route to Carentan.

The 502nd PIR was assigned the task of assaulting down this highway while the 327th GIR crossed the Douve north of Carentan and attacked from the northeast. 3rd Battalion, 502nd PIR led the 502nds attack, with a reconnaissance patrol reaching the fourth and final bridge on the causeway into Carentan on the morning of 10 June. The rest of 3/502 attempted to reach the fourth bridge during the day, but damage to the preceding bridges on the causeway, as well as artillery, dive bomber, machine gun and sniper fire, stalled the battalion until the next day and inflicted heavy casualties.

Early on 11 June, 3/502 resumes its attack and attempts to seize a farmhouse just beyond Bridge No.4, but is halted by heavy German fire. Using a smoke screen, the 3/502nd&#x27;s battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Robert G. Cole, led a bayonet charge that secured the farmhouse, allowing the 506th PIR to pass the 502nds lines and seize Carentan. For his bravery and leadership, LTC Cole was awarded the first of two Medals of Honor earned by Screaming Eagle soldiers in WWII.

As the regular troops moved in from the beachheads and strengthened the paratrooper positions, the 101st was relieved and returned to England to rest and refit for the next airborne operation. The first elements of the division returned to Southampton, England on 12 July 1944 in the presence of Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson according to the private papers of Lt. Gen. John C. H. Lee, commanding general of the Communications Zone, ETO who received the Secretary&#x27;s visit. After the American breakout from Normandy and subsequent liberation of France, SHAEF planned several jumps for the 101st ahead of the advancing armies, but all were cancelled prior to launch due to the rapid advance of Allied ground troops.

===== Operation Market Garden =====
On 17 September 1944, the 101st Airborne Division became part of XVIII Airborne Corps, under Major General Matthew Ridgway, part of the First Allied Airborne Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Lewis H. Brereton. The division took part in Operation Market Garden (17–25 September 1944), an unsuccessful Allied military operation under Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, commander of the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group, to capture Dutch bridges over the Rhine. It was fought in the Netherlands, and is the largest airborne operation of any war.

The plan, as outlined by Montgomery, required the seizure by airborne forces of several bridges on the Highway 69 across the Maas (Meuse River) and two arms of the Rhine (the Waal and the Lower Rhine), as well as several smaller canals and tributaries. Crossing these bridges would allow British armoured units to outflank the Siegfried Line, advance into northern Germany, and encircle the Ruhr, Germany&#x27;s industrial heartland, thus ending the war. This meant the large-scale use of Allied airborne forces, including both the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, along with the British 1st Airborne Division.

The operation was initially successful. Several bridges between Eindhoven and Nijmegen were captured by the 82nd and 101st. The 101st met little resistance and captured most of their initial objectives by the end of 17 September. However, the demolition of the division&#x27;s primary objective, a bridge over the Wilhelmina Canal at Son, delayed the capture of the main road bridge over the Maas until 20 September. Faced with the loss of the bridge at Son, the 101st unsuccessfully attempted to capture a similar bridge a few kilometers away at Best but found the approach blocked. During the fighting near Best, Private First Class Joe E. Mann of 3rd Battalion, 502nd PIR posthumously earned the division&#x27;s second and last Medal of Honor during WWII for throwing his body unto a German grenade he was too badly wounded to throw back, saving several of his fellow soldiers. Other units continued moving to the south and eventually reached the northern end of Eindhoven.

At 06:00 on 18 September, the Irish Guards of the British Guards Armoured Division resumed the advance while facing determined resistance from German infantry and tanks. Around noon the 101st Airborne were met by the lead reconnaissance units from British XXX Corps. At 16:00 radio contact alerted the main force that the Son bridge had been destroyed and requested that a replacement Bailey bridge be brought forward. By nightfall the Guards Armoured Division had established itself in the Eindhoven area however transport columns were jammed in the packed streets of the town and were subjected to German aerial bombardment during the night. XXX Corps engineers, supported by German prisoners of war, constructed a class 40 Bailey bridge within 10 hours across the Wilhelmina Canal. The longest sector of the highway secured by the 101st Airborne Division later became known as &quot;Hell&#x27;s Highway&quot;.

Due to Operation Market Garden significantly extending the 21st Army Groups line, the 101st was attached to 21st Army Group to prevent its lines from being undermanned. The 101st reinforced the Nijmegen salient and relieved the British 43rd Wessex Division to defend against the German counter offensive against the salient in early October. The division was relieved in late November 1944 and returned to SHAEF reserve for rest and refit.

===== Battle of the Bulge =====

The Ardennes Offensive (16 December 1944 – 25 January 1945) was a major German offensive launched towards the end of World War II through the forested Ardennes Mountains region of Belgium. Germany&#x27;s planned goal for these operations was to split the British and American Allied line in half, capturing Antwerp, Belgium in the process, and then proceeding to encircle and destroy the entire British 21st Army Group and all 12th U.S. Army Group units north of the German advance, forcing the Western Allies to negotiate a peace treaty in the Axis Powers&#x27; favor as a result. In order to reach Antwerp before the Allies could regroup and bring their superior air power to bear, German mechanized forces had to seize all the major highways through eastern Belgium. Because all seven of the main roads in the Ardennes converged on the small town of Bastogne, control of its crossroads was vital to the success or failure of the German attack.

Despite several notable signs in the weeks preceding the attack, the Ardennes Offensive achieved virtually complete surprise. By the end of the second day of battle, it became apparent that the 28th Infantry Division was near collapse. Maj. Gen. Troy H. Middleton, commander of VIII Corps, ordered part of his armored reserve, Combat Command B of the 10th Armored Division to Bastogne. Meanwhile, Gen. Eisenhower ordered forward the SHAEF reserve, composed of the 82nd and 101st Airborne, which were stationed at Reims.

Both divisions were alerted on the evening of 17 December, and not having organic transport, began arranging trucks for movement forward, the weather conditions being unfit for a parachute drop. The 82nd, longer in reserve and thus better re-equipped, moved out first. The 101st left Camp Mourmelon on the afternoon of 18 December, with the order of march the division artillery, division trains, 501st PIR, 506th PIR, 502nd PIR, and 327th Glider Infantry. Much of the convoy was conducted at night in drizzle and sleet, using headlights despite threat of air attack to speed the movement, and at one point the combined column stretched from Bouillon, Belgium, back to Reims.

The 101st Airborne was routed to Bastogne, located away on a high plateau, while the 82nd Airborne took up positions further north to block the critical advance of &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; toward Werbomont, Belgium. The 705th Tank Destroyer Battalion, in reserve sixty miles to the north, was ordered to Bastogne to provide anti-tank support to the armorless 101st Airborne on the 18th and arrived late the next evening. The first elements of the 501st PIR entered the division assembly area four miles west of Bastogne shortly after midnight of 19 December, and by 09:00 the entire division had arrived.

By 21 December, the German forces had surrounded Bastogne, which was defended by both the 101st Airborne and Combat Command B of the 10th Armored Division. Conditions inside the perimeter were tough—most of the medical supplies and medical personnel had been captured on 19 December. CCB of the 10th Armored Division, severely weakened by losses in delaying the German advance, formed a mobile &quot;fire brigade&quot; of 40 light and medium tanks (including survivors of CCR of the 9th Armored Division, which had been destroyed while delaying the Germans, and eight replacement tanks found unassigned in Bastogne). Three artillery battalions, including the all-black 969th Field Artillery Battalion, were commandeered by the 101st and formed a temporary artillery group. Each had twelve 155 mm howitzers, providing the division with heavy firepower in all directions restricted only by its limited ammunition supply (by 22 December artillery ammunition was restricted to 10 rounds per gun per day). The weather cleared the next day, however, and supplies (primarily ammunition) were dropped over four of the next five days.
Despite several determined German attacks, the perimeter held. The German commander, Generalleutnant Heinrich Freiherr von Lüttwitz, requested Bastogne&#x27;s surrender. When General Anthony McAuliffe, now acting commander of the 101st, was told, he commented : &quot;Nuts!&quot; After turning to other pressing issues, his staff reminded him that there should be a reply to the German demand. One officer (Harry W. O. Kinnard, then a lieutenant colonel) recommended that McAuliffe&#x27;s reply would be &quot;tough to beat&quot;. Thus, McAuliffe wrote on the paper delivered to the Germans: &quot;NUTS!&quot; That reply had to be explained, both to the Germans and to non-American Allies.

Both of the two panzer divisions of the XLVII Panzer Corps moved forward from Bastogne after 21 December, leaving only one panzergrenadier regiment of the Panzer-Lehr-Division to assist the 26th Volksgrenadier Division in attempting to capture the crossroads. The 26th VG received additional armor and panzergrenadier reinforcements on Christmas Eve to prepare for its final assault, to take place on Christmas Day. Because it lacked sufficient armor and troops and the 26th VG Division was near exhaustion, the XLVII Panzer Corps concentrated the assault on several individual locations on the west side of perimeter in sequence rather than launching one simultaneous attack on all sides. The assault, despite initial success by German tanks in penetrating the American line, was defeated and virtually all of the German tanks involved were destroyed. The next day, 26 December, the spearhead of General George S. Patton&#x27;s U.S. Third Army relief force, the 4th Armored Division, broke through the German lines and opened a corridor to Bastogne, ending the siege. The division got the nickname &quot;The Battered Bastards of the Bastion of Bastogne&quot;.

With the encirclement broken, the men of the 101st expected to be relieved, but were given orders to resume the offensive. The 506th attacked north and recaptured Recogne on 9 January 1945, the Bois des Corbeaux (&quot;Corbeaux Wood&quot;), to the right of Easy Company, on 10 January, and Foy on 13 January. The 327th attacked towards Bourcy, northeast of Bastogne, on 13 January and encountered stubborn resistance. The 101st Airborne Division faced the elite of the German military which included such units as 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, Führerbegleitbrigade, 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend, and the 9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen. The 506th retook Noville on 15 January and Rachamps the next day. The 502nd reinforced the 327th, and the two regiments captured Bourcy on 17 January, pushing the Germans back to their point of advance on the day the division had arrived in Bastogne. The next day the 101st Airborne Division was relieved.

===== Liberation of Kaufering =====
In April 1945, the 101st moved into the Rhineland and eventually reached the Bavarian Alps. As the 101st drove into Southern Germany they liberated Kaufering IV, one of the camps in the Kaufering complex. Kaufering IV had been designated as the sick camp where prisoners who could no longer work were sent. During the typhus epidemic of 1945 in Germany, Kaufering prisoners with typhus were sent there to die. Kaufering IV was located near the town of Hurlach, which the 12th Armored Division occupied on 27 April, with the 101st arriving the next day. The soldiers found over 500 dead inmates and the Army ordered the local townspeople to bury the dead.

=== Post-war ===
On 1 August 1945, the 501st PIR was moved to France, while the rest of the division was based around Zell am See and Kaprun in the Austrian Alps. Some units within the division began training for redeployment to the Pacific Theatre of War, but the war ended before they were needed. The division was inactivated 30 November 1945. For their efforts during World War II, the 101st Airborne Division was awarded four campaign streamers and two Presidential Unit Citations.

=== Helmet insignia ===
The 101st was distinguished partly by its tactical helmet insignia. Card suits (diamonds, spades, hearts, and clubs) on each side of the helmet denoted the regiment to which a soldier belonged. The only exception was the 187th which was added to the division later. Divisional headquarters and support units were denoted by use of a square and divisional artillery by a circle. Tick marks at 3, 6, and 9 o&#x27;clock indicated to which battalion the individual belonged, while the tick mark at 12 o&#x27;clock indicated a headquarters or headquarters company assignment.
* These insignia were first seen in World War II, and can still be seen on 101st Division soldiers today.
** 327th: Clubs (♣) (Currently worn by the 1st Brigade Combat Team; depicted in the 1949 film &quot;Battleground&quot;)
** 501st: Diamonds (♦) (Currently 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment is part of the 2nd Brigade, 11th Airborne Division in Alaska.) (The diamond is currently used by both 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment and the 101st Combat Aviation Brigade)
** 502nd: Hearts (♥) (Currently worn by the 2nd Brigade Combat Team)
** 506th: Spades (♠) (Formerly worn by 4th Brigade Combat Team before their inactivation in 2014; depicted in the mini-series &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;; currently worn by 1st and 2nd Battalion of the 506th Infantry Regiment)
** 187th: Torii () (Currently worn by the 3rd Brigade Combat Team; not during World War II, when the 187th Infantry Regiment was part of the 11th Airborne Division.)

===Postwar training and pentomic reactivation===
The 101st Airborne was allotted to the Regular Army in June 1948 and reactivated as a training unit at Camp Breckenridge, Kentucky the following July, only to be inactivated the next year. It was reactivated in 1950 following the outbreak of the Korean War, again to serve as a Training Center at Camp Breckenridge until inactivated in December 1953. During this time it included the 53rd Airborne Infantry Regiment.

It was reactivated again in May 1954 at Fort Jackson, South Carolina and in March 1956, the 101st was transferred, less personnel and equipment, to Fort Campbell, Kentucky, to be reorganized as a combat division. Using the personnel and equipment of the 187th ARCT and the 508th ARCT, the 101st was reactivated as the first &quot;pentomic&quot; division with five battle groups in place of its World War II structure that included regiments and battalions. The reorganization was in place by late April 1957 and the division&#x27;s battle groups were:
* 2nd Airborne Battle Group, 187th Infantry
* 1st Airborne Battle Group, 327th Infantry
* 1st Airborne Battle Group, 501st Infantry
* 1st Airborne Battle Group, 502nd Infantry
* 1st Airborne Battle Group, 506th Infantry

Division artillery consisted of the following units:
* Battery D, 319th Artillery
* Battery E, 319th Artillery
* Battery A, 321st Artillery
* Battery B, 321st Artillery
* Battery C, 321st Artillery
* Battery A, 377th Artillery

Other supporting units were also assigned.

===Civil rights===
The &quot;Little Rock Nine&quot; were a group of African-American students who were enrolled in Little Rock Central High School in September 1957, as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in the historic &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; case. Elements of the division&#x27;s 1st Airborne Battle Group, 327th Infantry were ordered to Little Rock by President Eisenhower to escort the students into the formerly segregated school during the crisis. The division was under the command of Major General Edwin Walker, who was committed to protecting the black students. The troops were deployed from September until Thanksgiving 1957, when Task Force 153rd Infantry, (federalized Arkansas Army National Guard) which had also been on duty at the school since 24 September, assumed the responsibility.

===STRAC===
In 1958 the US Army formed the Strategic Army Corps consisting of the 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions and the 1st and 4th Infantry Divisions with a mission of rapid deployment on short notice.

===Vietnam War===

On 29 July 1965, the 1st Brigade deployed to II Corps, South Vietnam with the following units:
* 1st Battalion, 327th Infantry
* 2nd Battalion, 327th Infantry
* 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry
* 2nd Battalion, 320th Artillery
* Troop A, 2nd Squadron 17th Cavalry
* 101st Support Battalion (Provisional)
* Company A, 326th Engineer Battalion
* Company D, 326th Medical Battalion
* Company B, 501st Signal Battalion
* 20th Chemical Detachment
* 181st Military Intelligence Detachment
* 406th Army Security Agency Detachment

From 1965 to 1967, the 1st Brigade operated independently as sort of a fire brigade and earned the reputation as being called the &quot;Nomads of Vietnam.&quot; They fought in every area of South Vietnam from the Demilitarized Zone up north all the way down the Central Highlands. In May 1967 the 1st Brigade operated as part of Task Force Oregon.

Within the United States, the 101st, along with the 82nd Airborne Division, was sent in to quell the 1967 Detroit riot.

The rest of the 101st was deployed to Vietnam in November 1967 and the 1st Brigade rejoined its parent division. The 101st was deployed in the northern I Corps region, operating against the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) infiltration routes through Laos and the A Shau Valley for most of the war. Notable among these were the Battle of Hamburger Hill in 1969 and Firebase Ripcord in 1970.

During the war, the division&#x27;s bald eagle patch resulted in the North Vietnamese Army referring to 101st Airborne soldiers as &quot;chicken men.&quot;

====Tiger Force====
Tiger Force was the nickname of a long-range reconnaissance patrol unit of the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 327th Infantry Regiment, 1st Brigade (Separate), 101st Airborne Division, which fought in the Vietnam War. The platoon-sized unit, approximately 45 paratroopers, was founded by Colonel David Hackworth in November 1965 to &quot;outguerrilla the guerrillas&quot;. Tiger Force (Recon) 1/327th was a highly decorated small unit in Vietnam, and paid for its reputation with heavy casualties. In October 1968, Tiger Force&#x27;s parent battalion was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation by President Lyndon B. Johnson, which included a mention of Tiger Force&#x27;s service at Đắk Tô in June 1966.

The unit was accused of committing multiple war crimes. Investigators concluded that many of the war crimes indeed took place. Despite this, the Army decided not to pursue any prosecutions. By the end of the war, Tiger Force had killed approximately 1,000 enemy soldiers.

====Lam Son 719====
In 1971, elements of the division supported Operation Lam Son 719, the South Vietnamese invasion of southern Laos, but only aviation units actually entered Laos.

The division began withdrawing from South Vietnam on 15 May 1971 with the departure of the 3rd Battalion, 506th Infantry. Most major units of the Division had redeployed by January 1972.

In the seven years that all or part of the division served in Vietnam it suffered 4,011 killed and 18,259 wounded in action. The division, during this time, participated in 12 separate campaigns and 17 of the division&#x27;s Medal of Honor recipients are from this period of time – all this giving the 101st Airborne Division a combat record unmatched by any other division.

===Post-Vietnam===

In 1968, the 101st took on the structure and equipment of an airmobile division. Following its return from Vietnam, the division was rebuilt with one brigade (3d) and supporting elements on jump status, using the assets of what had been the 173rd Airborne Brigade. The remaining two brigades and supporting units were organized as airmobile. With the exception of certain specialized units, such as the pathfinders and parachute riggers, in early 1974 the Army terminated jump status for the division. Concurrently the 101st introduced the Airmobile Badge (renamed later that year as the Air Assault Badge), the design of which was based on the Glider Badge of World War II. Initially the badge was only authorized for wear while assigned to the division, but in 1978 the Army authorized it for service-wide wear. Soldiers continued to wear the garrison cap with glider patch, bloused boots, and their specific unit&#x27;s airborne background trimming behind their Air Assault or Parachute Badge, as had division paratroopers before them. A blue beret was authorized for the division in March or April 1974 and worn until revoked at the end of 1979.

The division also was authorized to wear a full color (white eagle) shoulder patch insignia instead of the subdued green eagle shoulder patch that was worn as a combat patch by soldiers who fought with the 101st in Vietnam. While serving with the 101st, it was also acceptable to wear a non-subdued patch as a combat patch, a distinction shared with the 1st and 5th Infantry divisions.
In the late 1970s, the division maintained one battalion on a rotating basis as the division ready force (DRF). The force was in place to respond to alerts for action anywhere in the world. After alert notification, troopers of the &quot;hot&quot; platoon/company, would be airborne, &quot;wheels-up&quot; within 30 minutes as the first responding unit. All other companies of the battalion would follow within one hour. Within 24 hours there would be one brigade deployed to the affected area, with the remainder of the division deploying as needed.

In September 1980, 1st Battalion, 502nd Infantry, 2nd Brigade, took part in Operation Bright Star &#x27;80, an exercise deployment to Egypt. In 1984, the command group formed a full-time team, the &quot;Screaming Eagles&quot;, Command Parachute Demonstration Team. However the team traces its history to the late 1950s, during the infancy of precision free fall.

On 12 December 1985, a civilian aircraft, Arrow Air Flight 1285, chartered to transport some of the division from peacekeeping duty with the Multinational Force and Observers on the Sinai Peninsula to Kentucky, crashed just a short distance from Gander International Airport, Gander, Newfoundland. All eight air crew members and 248 US servicemen died, most were from the 3d Battalion, 502d Infantry. Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board investigators were unable to determine the exact sequence of events which led to the accident, but determined that the probable cause of the crash was the aircraft&#x27;s unexpectedly high drag and reduced lift condition, most likely due to ice contamination on the wings&#x27; leading edges and upper surfaces, as well as underestimated onboard weight. A minority report stated that the accident could have been caused by an onboard explosion of unknown origin prior to impact. At the time it was 17th most disastrous aviation accident in terms of fatalities. President Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy traveled to Fort Campbell to comfort grieving family members.

On 8 March 1988, two U.S. Army Blackhawk helicopters assigned to the 101st Aviation Brigade collided while on a night training mission at Fort Campbell. All 17 soldiers aboard were killed. The dead included four helicopter crewmen and 13 members of the 502d Infantry Regiment. The Army&#x27;s accident investigation attributed the crash to pilot error, aircraft design, and the limited field of view afforded pilots using night vision goggles (NVGs). Numerous improvements have been made in NVG technology since the accident occurred.

===Air assault operations===
In 1974, the 101st Airborne was reorganized as an air assault division. The foundation of modern-day air assault operations was laid by the World War Two era German Fallschirmjäger, Brandenburgers, and the 22nd Air Landing Division glider borne paras. In 1941 the U.S. Army quickly adopted this concept of offensive operations initially utilizing wooden gliders before the development of helicopters. Air Assault operations consist of highly mobile teams covering extensive distances and engaging enemy forces behind enemy lines and often by surprise, as they are usually masked by darkness.

The 101st Airborne had earned a place in the U.S. Army&#x27;s AirLand Battle doctrine. This doctrine is based on belief that initiative, depth, agility, and synchronization successfully complete a mission. First all soldiers are encouraged to take the initiative to seize and exploit opportunities to gain advantages over the enemy. Second, commanders are urged to utilize the entire depth of the battlefield and strike at rear targets that support frontline enemy troops. Third, agility requires commanders to strike the enemy quickly where most vulnerable and to respond to the enemy&#x27;s strengths. Fourth, synchronization calls for the commander to maximize available combined arms firepower for critical targets to achieve the greatest effect.

===Gulf War===

On 17 January 1991, the 101st Aviation Regiment fired the first shots of the war when eight AH-64 helicopters successfully destroyed two Iraqi early warning radar sites. In February 1991, the 101st once again had its &quot;Rendezvous with Destiny&quot; in Iraq during the combat air assault into enemy territory. The 101st Airborne Division struck behind enemy lines. It was the deepest air assault operation in history.

Approximately 400 helicopters transported 2,000 soldiers into Iraq, where they destroyed Iraqi columns trying to flee westward and prevented the escape of Iraqi forces. The Screaming Eagles would travel an additional into Iraq. By nightfall, the 101st had cut off Highway 8, which was a vital supply line running between Basra and the Iraqi forces. The 101st lost 16 soldiers in action during the 100-hour war and captured thousands of the enemy.

==Post-Cold War to present==
===Humanitarian aid===
The division has supported humanitarian relief efforts in Rwanda and Somalia, then later supplied peacekeepers to Haiti and Bosnia.

===Kosovo===
From February through August 2000, 3rd Brigade 1/187 deployed to Kosovo for peacekeeping operations as part of Task Force Falcon in support of Operation Joint Guardian.

In August 2000, the 2nd Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment, as well as some elements from the 502nd Infantry Regiment, helped secure the peace in Kosovo and support the October elections for the formation of the new Kosovo government. They were replaced in February 2001 with 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment along with 2nd Brigade HQ and elements of 3rd Battalion.

===Montana forest fires===
In September and October 2000, the 3rd Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment, helped fight fires on the Bitterroot National Forest in Montana. Designated Task Force Battle Force and commanded by Lt. Col. Jon S. Lehr, the battalion fought fires throughout the surrounding areas of their Valley Complex near Darby, Montana.

===Operation Enduring Freedom===

The 101st Airborne (Air Assault) Division brigade performed counterinsurgency operations within Afghanistan, consisting mostly of raids, ambushes and patrolling. The 101st also performed combat air assaults throughout the operation.

The 2nd Brigade, &quot;Strike&quot;, built around the 502nd Infantry, was largely deployed to Kosovo on peacekeeping operations, with some elements of 3rd Battalion, 502nd, deploying after 9/11 as a security element in the U.S. CENTCOM AOR with the Fort Campbell-based 5th Special Forces Group. They had been positioned in Jordan providing security for 5th SF Group&#x27;s exercise prior to 9/11.

The division quickly deployed its 3rd Brigade, the 187th Infantry&#x27;s &quot;Rakkasans&quot;, as the first conventional unit to fight as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.

After an intense period of combat in rugged Shoh-I-Khot Mountains of eastern Afghanistan during Operation Anaconda with elements of the 10th Mountain Division, the &quot;Rakkasans&quot; redeployed to Fort Campbell only to find the 101st awaiting another deployment order. In 2008, the 101st 4th BCT Red and White &quot;Currahee&quot; including the 1st and the 2nd Battalions, 506th Infantry were deployed to Afghanistan. Elements of 1st Battalion, 506th Infantry Regiment participated in joint operations with U.S. Army Special Forces particularly in the Northern province of Kapisa in the outpost Forward Operating Base (FOB) Kutchsbach. Charlie Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Infantry Regiment performed joint operations with 5th Special Forces Group and 20th Special Forces Group in 2011. The 101st Combat Aviation Brigade deployed to Afghanistan as Task Force Destiny in early 2008 to Bagram Air Base. 159th Combat Aviation Brigade deployed as Task Force Thunder for 12 months in early 2009, and again in early 2011.

In March 2010, the 101st Combat Aviation Brigade deployed again to Afghanistan as Task Force Destiny to Kandahar Airfield to be the aviation asset in southern Afghanistan.

===Operation Iraqi Freedom===

In 2003, Major General David H. Petraeus (&quot;Eagle 6&quot;) led the Screaming Eagles to war during the 2003 invasion of Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom). General Petraeus led the division into Iraq saying, &quot;Guidons, Guidons. This is Eagle 6. The 101st Airborne Division&#x27;s next Rendezvous with Destiny is North to Baghdad. Op-Ord Desert Eagle 2 is now in effect. Godspeed. Air Assault. Out.&quot;

The division was in V Corps, providing support to the 3rd Infantry Division by clearing Iraqi strongpoints which that division had bypassed. 3rd Battalion, 187th Infantry (3rd Brigade) was attached to 3rd Infantry Division and was the main effort in clearing Saddam International Airport. The division then served as part of the occupation forces of Iraq, using the city of Mosul as their primary base of operations. 1st and 2d Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment (1st Brigade) oversaw the remote airfield Qayarrah West south of Mosul. The 502d Infantry Regiment (2d Brigade) and 3d Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment were responsible for Mosul itself while the 187th Infantry Regiment (3d Brigade) controlled Tal Afar just west of Mosul. The 101st Airborne also participated in the Battle of Karbala. The city had been bypassed during the advance on Baghdad, leaving American units to clear it in two days of street fighting against Iraqi irregular forces. The 101st Airborne was supported by the 2nd Battalion, 70th Armor Regiment with Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 41st Infantry Regiment, 1st Armored Division. The 3d Battalion, 502d Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division was awarded a Valorous Unit Award for their combat performance.

On the afternoon of 22 July 2003, troops of the 101st Airborne 3/327th Infantry HQ and C-Company, aided by U.S. Special Forces killed Qusay Hussein, his 14-year-old son Mustapha, and his older brother Uday, during a raid on a home in Mosul. After Task Force 121 members were wounded, the 3/327th Infantry surrounded and fired on the house with a TOW missile, Mark 19 Automatic Grenade Launcher, M2 50 Caliber Machine guns and small arms. After about four hours of battle (the whole operation lasted six hours), the soldiers entered the house and found four dead, including the two brothers and their bodyguard. There were reports that Qusay&#x27;s 14-year-old son Mustapha was the fourth body found. Brig. Gen. Frank Helmick, the assistant commander of 101st Airborne, commented that all occupants of the house died during the fierce gun battle before U.S. troops entered.

Once replaced by the first operational Stryker Brigade, the 101st was withdrawn in early 2004 for rest and refit. As part of the Army&#x27;s modular transformation, the existing infantry brigades, artillery brigade, and aviation brigades were transformed. The Army also activated the 4th Brigade Combat Team, which includes the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 506th Infantry Regiment and subordinate units. Both battalions were part of the 101st in Vietnam but saw their colors inactivated during an Army-wide reflagging of combat battalions in the 1980s.

As of December 2007, 143 members of the division have died while on service in Iraq.

===Second deployment to Iraq===
The division&#x27;s second deployment to Iraq began in the late summer of 2005. The division headquarters replaced the 42d Infantry Division, which had been directing security operations as the headquarters for Task Force Liberty. Renamed Task Force Band of Brothers, the 101st assumed responsibility on 1 November 2005 for four provinces in north central Iraq: Salah ad Din, As Sulymaniyah.

During the second deployment, 2d and 4th Brigades of the 101st Airborne Division were assigned to conduct security operations under the command of Task Force Baghdad, led initially by 3d Infantry Division, which was replaced by 4th Infantry Division. The 1st Battalion of the 506th Infantry (4th Brigade) was separated from the division and served with the Marines in Ramadi, in the Al Anbar province. 3d Brigade was assigned to Salah ad Din and Bayji sectors and 1st Brigade was assigned to the overall Kirkuk province which included Hawijah.

Task Force Band of Brothers&#x27; primary mission during its second deployment to Iraq was the training of Iraqi security forces. When the 101st returned to Iraq, there were no Iraqi units capable of assuming the lead for operations against Iraqi and foreign terrorists. As the division concluded its tour, 33 battalions were in the lead for security in assigned areas, and two of four Iraq divisions in northern Iraq were commanding and controlling subordinate units.

Simultaneously with training Iraqi soldiers and their leaders, 101st soldiers conducted numerous security operations against terrorist cells operating in the division&#x27;s assigned, six-province area of operations. Operation Swarmer was the largest air assault operation conducted in Iraq since 22 April 2003. 1st Brigade conducted Operation Scorpion with Iraqi units near Kirkuk.

Developing other aspects of Iraqi society also figured in 101st operations in Iraq. Division commander Major General Thomas Turner hosted the first governors&#x27; conference for the six provinces in the division&#x27;s area of operations, as well as the neighboring province of Erbil.

===Return to Afghanistan===
While the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Brigade Combat Teams were deployed to Iraq 2007–2008, the division headquarters, 4th Brigade Combat Team, the 101st Sustainment Brigade, and the 101st Combat Aviation Brigade followed by the 159th Combat Aviation Brigade were deployed to Afghanistan for one-year tours falling within the 2007–09 window.

==== 2010 Afghanistan ====
The Division Headquarters, 101st Combat Aviation Brigade, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 2d Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, and 4th Brigade Combat Team, and the 101st Sustainment Brigade deployed to Afghanistan in 2010. This is the first time since returning from Iraq in 2006 where all four infantry brigades (plus one CAB, SUSBDE) have served in the same combat theater.

On 15 September 2010, the 101st Airborne began a major operation known as Operation Dragon Strike. The aim of the operation was to reclaim the strategic southern province of Kandahar, which was the birthplace of the Taliban movement. The area where the operation took place has been dubbed &quot;The Heart of Darkness&quot; by Coalition troops.

By the end of December 2010, the operation&#x27;s main objectives had been accomplished. The majority of Taliban forces in Kandahar had withdrawn from the province, and much of their leadership was said to have been fractured.

As of 5 June 2011, 131 soldiers had been killed during this deployment, the highest death toll to the 101st Airborne in any single deployment since the Vietnam War.

==== 2011 Afghanistan ====
The 2nd Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment conducted a major combat operation in Barawala Kalay Valley, Kunar Province, Afghanistan in late March–April 2011. It is known as the Battle of Barawala Kalay Valley. It was an operation to close down the Taliban supply route through the Barawala Kalay Valley and to remove the forces of Taliban warlord Qari Ziaur Rahman from the Barwala Kalay Valley. The 2nd Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment would suffer 6 killed and 7 wounded during combat operations. It would inflict over 100 casualties on the Taliban and successfully close down the Taliban supply route. ABC News correspondent Mike Boettcher was on scene and he called it the fiercest fighting he has ever seen in his 30 years of being in war zones.

Since the beginning of Operation Enduring Freedom 166 101st Airborne soldiers have died while serving in Iraq.

===Operation United Assistance===
In 2014, the 101st Airborne Division Headquarters deployed to west Africa to help contain the spread of Ebola, as part of Operation United Assistance.

Earlier in April 2014, 4th Brigade Combat Team had been inactivated as part of the Army&#x27;s 2020 BCT restructuring program.

===5th Special Forces Group===
In 2015, 5th Special Forces Group held five training sessions with the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division. The classes covered communications and the operation of all-terrain vehicles. There was also a training session on the operation of TOW missiles. Prior to these sessions training between U.S. Special Forces and U.S. conventional forces had been uncommon.

===Operation Inherent Resolve===
It was announced 14 January 2016 that soldiers of the 101st Airborne would be assigned rotations in Iraq, to train members of the Iraqi ground forces in preparation for action against the Islamic State. Defense Secretary Ash Carter told the 101st Airborne that &quot;The Iraqi and Peshmerga forces you will train, advise and assist have proven their determination, their resiliency, and increasingly, their capability. But they need you to continue building on that success, preparing them for the fight today and the long hard fight for their future. They need your skill. They need your experience.&quot;

In spring 2016, 2nd Brigade deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Inherent Resolve, a US-led coalition with the mission of defeating the Islamic State. The Strike Brigade conducted precision surface-to-surface fires and supported a multitude of intelligence and logistical operations for coalition and Iraqi forces. They also provided base security throughout more than 12 areas of operations. The Brigade also aided in the clearance of ISIS from Fallujah, the near elimination of suicide attacks in Baghdad, and the introduction of improved tactics that liberated more than 100 towns and villages. The 2nd Brigade also played a significant role in the liberation of Mosul.

200 soldiers from 1st Battalion, 320th Field Artillery Regiment, 2nd Brigades field artillery battalion, replaced a unit of the 26th MEU at Firebase Bell; they used M777 155mm howitzers to provide support to Iraqi forces attacking IS-occupied villages between Makhmour and Mosul.

On 26 June 2016, it was announced that Iraq had successfully taken back full control of Fallujah from the Islamic State of Iraq (ISIS). Iraqi ground troops have been under the direction of the 101st Airborne since early 2016. In summer 2016, &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; reported that about 400 soldiers from 2nd Brigade Combat Team will deploy to Iraq as part of 11 July 2016 announcement by Defense Secretary Ash Carter of the presidential approved deployment of an additional 560 U.S. troops to Iraq to help establish and run a logistics hub at Qayyarah Airfield West, about 40 miles south Mosul, to support Iraqi and coalition troops in the Battle of Mosul.

On 26 August 2016, an article from the website War is Boring shows a photo of a 101st Airborne Division M777 howitzer crew conducting fire missions during an operation to support Iraqi forces at Kara Soar Base in Iraq on 7 August 2016. The article also confirms that American artillery has been supporting Iraqi forces during its campaign against ISIS.
On 21 September 2016, an article from &quot;The Leaf-Chronicle&quot; reported that Battery C, 1st Battalion, 320th Field Artillery Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division had been successfully conducting artillery raids against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. Battery C is said to have executed hundreds of missions and fired thousands of rounds in support of ISF operations since arriving in theatre in late May.

On 17 October 2016, an article from &quot;The Leaf-Chronicle&quot; stated that the 101st Airborne was leading a coalition of 19 nations to support the liberation of Mosul from ISIL. Under the direction of the 101st Iraqi forces have taken back a significant amount of geography from the control of ISIS. This included the liberation of Hit, Fallujah, and Qayyarah.

On 3 November 2016, it was reported that U.S. Army combat engineers were seen just west of the Great Zab River about halfway between the Kurdish city of Irbil and Mosul. They were searching for improvised bombs. They were wearing 101st Airborne Division patches. The soldiers said they were not allowed to talk to the media.

On 17 November 2016, sources reported that the 101st Airborne Division was headed home after a nine-month deployment to Iraq. Over the course of nine months, soldiers from the 101st Airborne helped train the Iraqi government&#x27;s security forces. They taught marksmanship, basic battlefield medical care and ways to detect and disarm improvised explosive devices. The division helped authorize 6,900 strikes, meant to destroy ISIS hideouts and staging areas. The 101st Airborne played a significant role in the liberation of several Iraqi cities during this deployment.

1st Brigade &quot;Bastogne&quot; deployed troops to Iraq and Syria in January 2019, returning the following September. It was reported that many Combat Action Badges had been award, primarily to artillery batteries conducting fire missions against Islamic State fighters, with some Combat Infantryman Badges issued to troops in northern Syria.

===Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel===
On 6 September 2016, the U.S. Army announced it will deploy about 1,400 soldiers from 3rd Brigade Combat Team to Afghanistan in fall 2016, in support of &quot;Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel&quot; – the U.S. counter-terrorism operation against the remnants of al-Qaeda, ISIS–K and other terror groups, as part of the War in Afghanistan (2001–2021). Senior leadership referred to the 3rd Brigade Combat Team as being exceptional. Brig. Gen. Scott Brower stated that the Rakkasans are trained, well-led, and prepared to accomplish any mission given to them. During this deployment three Soldiers from 1/187, 3rd Brigade Combat Team died as a result of an insider attack by an Afghan Soldier.

===Somali Civil War (2009–present)===
In mid-April 2017, it was reported that 40 soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division were deployed to Somalia on 2 April 2017 to improve the capabilities of the Somali Army in combating Islamist militants. AFRICOM stated that the troops will focus on bolstering the Somali army&#x27;s logistics capabilities; an AFRICOM spokesman said that &quot;This mission is not associated with teaching counterextremism tactics&quot; and that the Somali government requested the training.

===Operation Atlantic Resolve===
In June 2022, Headquarters, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) and the 2nd Brigade Combat Team rotated in to the U.S. Army V Corps&#x27; mission to reinforce NATO&#x27;s eastern flank and engage in multinational exercises with partners across the European continent in order to reassure allies and deter further Russian aggression during its invasion of Ukraine. The 101st soldiers deploying to Mihail Kogălniceanu in June did not represent additional U.S. forces in Europe, but are taking the place of soldiers assigned to 82nd Airborne Division Headquarters and the 3rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team of the 82nd Airborne Division. In all, approximately 4700 soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division are scheduled to deploy to locations across Europe.

On 30 July 2022, the Headquarters, 101st Airborne Division and 2nd Brigade Combat Team uncased their colors and conducted an air assault demonstration at the 57th Air Base &quot;Mihail Kogălniceanu&quot; together with the 9th Mechanized Brigade of the Romanian Armed Forces. The event was attended by Maj. Gen. Joseph P. McGee and the Prime Minister of Romania, Nicolae Ciucă.

The 2nd Brigade Combat Team was replaced by the 1st Brigade Combat Team on 31 March 2023. During its 9 months of deployment, the 2nd Brigade conducted training exercises with multiple NATO partners and allies across the continent. On 5 April, the mission authority was transferred from the 101st Division to the 10th Mountain Division. The battle flag of the 101st was also decorated with the National Order of Faithful Service during the ceremony. On 24 November, the 3rd Brigade Combat Team &quot;Rakkasan&quot; replaced the 1st Brigade Combat Team following a transfer of authority ceremony.

=== Hurricane Helene response ===
In response to the damage inflicted by Hurricane Helene, soldiers of the 2nd Mobile Brigade Combat Team &quot;Strike&quot; and 101st Combat Aviation Brigade began deploying on October 5, 2024 to western North Carolina. The mission was Defense Support of Civil Authorities under the control of United States Army North. Soldiers from the 101st provided support to civil authorities in search and rescue, medical aid, route assessment and clearance, traffic control, warehouse management, supply distribution, debris removal, general transportation and equipment maintenance tasks. Strike Soldiers used newly issued Infantry Squad Vehicles and 101 CAB helicopters to access areas with damaged road infrastructure to carry out relief efforts.

<text>Prizzi&#x27;s Honor is a 1985 American black comedy crime film directed by John Huston, starring Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner as two highly skilled mob assassins who, after falling in love, are hired to kill each other. The screenplay co-written by Richard Condon is based on his 1982 novel of the same name. The film&#x27;s supporting cast includes Anjelica Huston, Robert Loggia, John Randolph, CCH Pounder, Lawrence Tierney, and William Hickey. Stanley Tucci appears in a minor role in his film debut. It was the last of John Huston&#x27;s films to be released during his lifetime.

&quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Honor&quot; was theatrically released on June 14, 1985, by 20th Century Fox. It received critical acclaim, with praise for the performances of its cast (most notably Huston). It grossed $26 million against its $16 million budget.

The film received eight nominations at the 58th Academy Awards (including for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay) with Huston winning for Best Supporting Actress. The film also won four Golden Globe Awards, including Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical for Nicholson and Turner, respectively.

==Plot==
Charley Partanna is a hitman for a New York Mafia family headed by the elderly Don Corrado Prizzi, whose business is generally handled by his sons Dominic and Eduardo and by his longtime right-hand man, Angelo, who is Charley&#x27;s father.

At a family wedding, Charley is quickly infatuated with a beautiful non-Italian woman he doesn&#x27;t recognize. He asks Maerose Prizzi, estranged daughter of Dominic, if she recognizes the woman, oblivious to the fact that Maerose still has feelings for Charley, having once been his lover. Maerose is in disfavor with her father for running off with another man before the end of her romance with Charley.

Charley flies to California to carry out a contract to kill a man named Marxie Heller for robbing a Nevada casino. He is surprised to learn that Marxie is the estranged husband of Irene Walker, the woman from the wedding. She repays some of the money Marxie stole as Charley naively (or willfully) believes that Irene was not involved with the casino scam. By this point they have fallen in love and eventually travel to Mexico to marry. A jealous Maerose travels west on her own to establish for a fact that Irene has double-crossed the organization. The information restores Maerose to good graces somewhat with her father and the don. Charley&#x27;s father later reveals that Irene (who had claimed to be a tax consultant) is a &quot;contractor&quot; who, like Charley, performs assassinations for the mob.

Dominic, acting on his own, wants Charley out of the way and hires someone to do the hit, not knowing that he has just given the job to Charley&#x27;s own wife. Angelo sides with his son, and Eduardo is so appalled by his brother&#x27;s actions that he helps set up Dominic&#x27;s permanent removal from the family.

Irene and Charley team up on a kidnapping that will enrich the family, but she shoots a police captain&#x27;s wife in the process, endangering the organization&#x27;s business relationship with the cops. The don is also still demanding a large sum of money from Irene for her unauthorized activities in Nevada, which she doesn&#x27;t want to pay. In time, the don tells Charley that his wife&#x27;s &quot;gotta go&quot;.

Matters come to a head in California when, acting as if everything were alright, Charley comes home to his wife. Each pulls a weapon simultaneously in the bedroom. Irene ends up dead, and Charley ends up back in New York, missing her, but consoled by Maerose.

==Cast==
==Production==
As well as working with his actress daughter, John Huston hired Meta Carpenter Wilde, the script supervisor who worked with him on &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941) and Rudi Fehr, his film editor from &quot;Key Largo&quot; (1948).

Anjelica Huston was paid the SAG-AFTRA scale rate of $14,000 for her role in &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Honor&quot;. When her agent called up the movie&#x27;s producer to request if she could be paid more, she was told &quot;Go to hell. Be my guest—ask for more money. We don&#x27;t even want her in this movie.&quot; Huston, who was not only John Huston&#x27;s daughter but also Jack Nicholson&#x27;s girlfriend at the time, wrote in her 2014 memoir &quot;Watch Me&quot; that she later overheard a production worker saying, &quot;Her father is the director, her boyfriend&#x27;s the star, and she has no talent.&quot; She would go on to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.

A 25-year-old Stanley Tucci made his film debut in &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Honor&quot;, playing the minor role of a mafia goon.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Honor&quot; holds an approval rating of 85% based on 41 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus states: &quot;Disturbing and sardonic, &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Honor&quot; excels at black comedy because director John Huston and his game ensemble take the farce deadly seriously.&quot; 

Pauline Kael wrote: &quot;This John Huston picture has a ripe and daring comic tone. It revels voluptuously in the murderous finagling of the members of a Brooklyn Mafia family, and rejoices in their scams. It&#x27;s like &quot;The Godfather&quot; acted out by &quot;The Munsters&quot;. Jack Nicholson&#x27;s average-guyness as Charley, the clan&#x27;s enforcer, is the film&#x27;s touchstone: this is a baroque comedy about people who behave in ordinary ways in grotesque circumstances, and it has the juice of everyday family craziness in it.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote: &quot;This is the most bizarre comedy in many a month, a movie so dark, so cynical and so funny that perhaps only Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner could have kept straight faces during the love scenes.&quot;

=== Awards and nominations ===
===American Film Institute===
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – Nominated
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions – Nominated

==Follow-up==

<text>Willem Hendrik Keesom () (21 June 1876, Texel – 3 March 1956, Leiden) was a Dutch physicist who, in 1926, invented a method to freeze liquid helium.
He also developed the first mathematical description of dipole–dipole interactions in 1921. Thus, dipole–dipole interactions are also known as Keesom interactions.
He was previously a student of Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, who had discovered superconductivity (a feat for which Kamerlingh Onnes received the 1913 Nobel Prize in Physics).

He also discovered the lambda point transition specific-heat maximum between Helium-I and Helium-II in 1930.

In 1924 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1966, the minor planet 
&quot;9686 Keesom&quot; was named after him.

<doc id="113457" wikidata="Q504346" url="?curid=113457" title="Fernando Flores">
<text>Carlos Fernando Flores Labra (born January 9, 1943) is a Chilean engineer, philosopher, entrepreneur and politician. He is a former cabinet minister of president Salvador Allende and was senator for the Arica and Parinacota and Tarapacá regions between 2001 and 2009. On March 31, 2010, he was designated President of Chile&#x27;s National Innovation Council for Competitiveness by President Sebastián Piñera.

==Biography==
Flores was born in Talca, Chile. He became finance minister in the government of Chilean president Salvador Allende and then spent three years as a political prisoner (from September 11, 1973 to 1976) after the military coup of General Augusto Pinochet. Subsequently, forced into exile after negotiations on his behalf by Amnesty International, he moved with his family to Palo Alto, California, and worked as a researcher in the Computer Science department at Stanford University. 

Flores &quot;had spent his prison years reading philosophy books smuggled in by friends and family, and emerged steeped in phenomenology, the study of the structures of experience and consciousness.&quot; While at Stanford Flores met and began a long collaboration with Terry Winograd. He subsequently obtained his PhD at UC Berkeley under the guidance of Hubert Dreyfus, Stuart Dreyfus, John Searle and Ann Markussen. 

At Berkeley he developed his work on philosophy, coaching and workflow technology, influenced by Martin Heidegger, Humberto Maturana, John Austin and others. Flores&#x27;s thesis was titled &quot;Management and Communication in the Office of the Future.&quot; 

Winograd has said that when he met Flores, &quot;his life changed.&quot; Conversations with Flores helped to convince Winograd that the AI research of the time (symbolic AI, or GOFAI) was based in a faulty understanding of the nature of cognition. Winograd&#x27;s own pathbreaking earlier research was included within the scope of this critique. These conversations between Winograd and Flores led to work on a manuscript that would become their co-authored book, &quot;Understanding Computers and Cognition: A New Foundation For Design&quot;. 

==Projects and companies founded==
Flores has founded several companies including &quot;Hermenet&quot; (in partnership with Werner Erhard); &quot;Logonet&quot;, a design, logistics, and manufacturing company; &quot;Business Design Associates&quot;, a management consulting company) and Action Technologies, a software company, where he introduced new distinctions in workflow analysis, groupware, software design and business process analysis that he developed in association with Terry Winograd. He has also founded an Internet-based movement called &quot;Atina Chile&quot;. His newest project is Pluralistic Networks , a professional development company dedicated to teaching skills and sensibilities enabling people to work together with others while navigating turbulent historical times.

==Politics==

Flores was Finance Minister of president Salvador Allende in the early 1970s and later the Secretary General of the Government and, during the Coup, he was alongside the President in La Moneda Palace. After the coup d&#x27;état he was imprisoned, subjected to prolonged, systematic psychological torture and later driven to exile by the military regime of Augusto Pinochet. Prior to being appointed Finance Minister by Allende, Flores was responsible for launching and overseeing Project Cybersyn, &quot;one of the most ambitious applications of cybernetics in history.&quot;

In 2001 Flores was elected senator for the Tarapacá Region, as a member of the center-left Party for Democracy (PPD), a constituent party of the governing coalition &quot;Concertación&quot;.

On March 31, 2010 he was designated President of Chile&#x27;s National Innovation Council for Competitiveness by President Piñera, position that he held until September 2013. In this role he was responsible to produce a report that he entitled &quot;Surfing into the Future&quot;.

== Influence on modern coaching industry ==
Flores exerted a significant influence on the development of the modern coaching industry by collaborating with or influencing several individuals who would become prominent leaders in the coach training industry. In the mid-1970&#x27;s Flores was hired by Werner Erhard to offer workshops for his office staff. Shortly after, Flores began offering, through his companies Hermenet, Inc. and Logonet, Inc., a workshop called &quot;Communication for Action.&quot; This workshop was based partially on his interpretation of the theory of Speech Acts by J.L. Austin and John Searle. 

For Austin and Searle, the theory of Speech Acts was just that, a theory; they did not pursue its practical implications. Flores transformed the theory of Speech Acts into a set of practices for refining how people take care of concerns, commitments, and relationships in conversation.As Flores expresses this in his book with Terry Winograd, &quot;Understanding Computers and Cognition&quot;: &quot;there exists a domain for education in communicative competence: the fundamental relationships between language and successful action. People’s conscious knowledge of their participation in the network of commitments can be reinforced and developed, improving their capacity to act in the domain of language.&quot; Thus, &quot;This training in &#x27;communication for action&#x27; reveals for people how their language acts participate in a network of human commitments.&quot;

As Hubert Dreyfus put it, Flores&#x27;s work enabled people to &quot;awaken from the sleep of thinking that they were exchanging information about the world, and take responsibility for the kind of being-with-others they were making for themselves ... By developing their sensitivity to their constituting roles, business people, among others, became more entrepreneurial, more flexible, and more innovative. This was Flores’s version of the authenticity Heidegger describes in Division II of &quot;Being and Time&quot;.&quot; 

In her study of the emergence of professional coaching, Dr. Vikki Brock identifies the collaboration between Werner Erhard and Fernando Flores as a convergence point that gave rise to a specific and distinct coaching lineage. However, after a brief association Flores and Erhard parted ways. Flores continued to develop his distinctive theory and practice of coaching and consulting. His 1997 book, &quot;Disclosing New Worlds&quot; (with Charles Spinosa and Hubert Dreyfus) captures some of the later developments in his approach.

<text>The 82nd Airborne Division is an airborne infantry division of the United States Army specializing in parachute assault operations into hostile areas with a U.S. Department of Defense mandate to be &quot;on-call to fight any time, anywhere&quot; at &quot;the knife&#x27;s edge of technology and readiness.&quot; Primarily based at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the 82nd Airborne Division is part of the XVIII Airborne Corps. The 82nd Airborne Division is the U.S. Army&#x27;s most strategically mobile division.

The division was organized on 25 August 1917, at Camp Hancock, Georgia, (now subdivided and owned by a combination of the City of Augusta-Richmond County, Veterans Administration, and private parties) and later served with distinction on the Western Front in the final months of World War I. Since its initial members came from all 48 states, the division acquired the nickname &quot;All-American&quot;, which is the basis for its &quot;AA&quot; on the shoulder patch. The division later served in World War II where, in August 1942, it was reconstituted as the first airborne division of the U.S. Army and fought in numerous campaigns during the war.

==Origins==
The 82nd Division was first constituted during World War I on 5August 1917 as an infantry division in the National Army. It was organized and formally activated on 25 August 1917 at Camp Gordon, Georgia. At the time, the division consisted entirely of newly conscripted soldiers. Original enlisted men assigned to the division came from Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee, but during October 1917, nearly all of them were transferred to fill shortages in National Guard and National Army units, principally the 30th, 31st, and 81st Divisions, which were training at other camps in the Southern United States. Replacements for them were received mostly from Camp Devens, Massachusetts, Camp Dix, New Jersey, Camps Lee and Meade, Virginia, and Camp Upton, New York, the men hailing from New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. In the spring, 5,000 more replacements for transfers made over the winter were assigned from Fort Devens, Camp Gordon, Camp Upton, Camp Dodge, Iowa, and Camp Travis, Texas, along with a contingent of men from Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee. The citizens of Atlanta held a contest to give a nickname to the new division, and in April 1918, Major General Eben Swift, the commanding general, chose &quot;All American&quot; to reflect the unique composition of the 82nd—it had soldiers from all 48 states in the Union.
The bulk of the division was two infantry brigades, each commanding two regiments. The 163rd Brigade commanded the 325th Infantry Regiment and the 326th Infantry Regiment along with the 320th Machine Gun Battalion. The 164th Brigade commanded the 327th Infantry Regiment and the 328th Infantry Regiment and the 321st Machine Gun Battalion. Also in the division were the 157th Field Artillery Brigade, composed of the 319th, 320th and 321st Field Artillery Regiments and the 307th Trench Mortar Battery; a divisional troops contingent, and a division train. The division sailed to Europe in May 1918 to join the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF), commanded by General John Pershing, on the Western Front.

==World War I==
Brigadier General William P. Burnham, who had previously commanded the 164th Brigade, led the division during most of its training and movement to Europe. In early April 1918, the division embarked from the ports in Boston, New York and Brooklyn to Liverpool, England, where the division fully assembled by mid-May 1918. From there, the division moved to Continental Europe, leaving Southampton and arriving at Le Havre, France. The 82nd Division then moved to the British-controlled sector of the Somme, where it began sending small numbers of troops and officers to the front lines to gain combat experience. On June 16, it moved by rail to the French sector. The division was briefly assigned to I Corps before falling under the command of IV Corps until late August. It was then moved to the Woëvre front.

===Battle of Saint-Mihiel===
As part of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) deployed during WWI, the 82nd Division began training with British forces in Picardy as early as May 10, 1918. From there they moved to the hotly contested French border region of Lorraine, which they occupied from June 16 to September 11 in preparation for the Saint-Mihiel offensive.

As the attack on the Saint-Mihiel salient began on September 12, the division engaged in a holding mission to prevent Imperial German Army forces from attacking the right flank of the First Army. This defensive action allowed the 163rd Brigade and 327th Infantry Regiment to advance north-east, raiding the communes of Port-sur-Seille, Eply, Bois de Cheminot, and Bois Fréhaut. Meanwhile, the 328th Infantry Regiment advanced on the west of the Moselle River, made contact with the 90th Division, and entered the town of Norroy, to consolidate American troop positions.

By September 17, the Saint-Mihiel offensive had stabilized, and preparations for the infamous Meuse-Argonne offensive began. On September 20, the 82nd Division was relieved by the French 69th Division. The 82nd Division was then stationed near Triaucourt and Rarécourt, near the First Army. During this operation, the 82nd Division suffered casualties from heavy artillery fire which the fresh American soldiers were completely unused to. The division was moved into reserve from September 26 to October 3 while it assembled near Varennes-en-Argonne to train and prepare for the Meuse-Argonne offensive.

===Meuse-Argonne Offensive===
The division mobilized to the Clermont area in Argonne (just west of Verdun) starting on September 24, stationed there to act as a reserve for the US First Army. On 3 October, Major General George B. Duncan, commander of the 77th Division, relieved William Burnham of his duties and took over as commander of the 82nd.

On the night of October 6, 1918, the 164th Brigade relieved troops of the 28th Division, which were holding the front line from south of Fléville to La Forge, along the eastern bank of the Aire River. OnOctober 7 the 82nd Division, minus the 163rd Brigade, which remained in reserve, attacked the northeastern edge of the Argonne Forest, taking &quot;Hill 223&quot; in the process. The division&#x27;s right flank entered the commune of Cornay but later withdrew southeast. The division&#x27;s left flank took the high ground northwest of Châtel-Chéhéry. On October 9, the division&#x27;s left flank advanced to form a line along the French pylons on the road to the Belgian city of la Louvière.

Throughout October, the division advanced north-east along the Aire (Aisne) river. On 10 October, it relieved troops of the 1st Division in Ardennes at Fléville and Sommerance. The 82nd Division then relaunched an attack on Cornay and the Belgian city of Enghien, successfully re-establishing the front there. On October 11, the right flank of the division took the high ground north of the Rance river while the left flank continued to advance along the Aire. The next day, the 42nd Division relieved the 82nd&#x27;s troops in Sommerance. Attacking with fresh troops, the 82nd broke through the Hindenburg Line on October 15.

On October 18, the 82nd Division relieved the 78th division at Champigneulle. Three days later it advanced to the Ravin aux Pierres. On 31 October, the 82nd, except the artillery, was relieved by the 77th Division and the 80th Division, and assembled in the Argonne Forest to regroup. On 10 November, it moved again to training areas in Bourmont, where it remained until the Armistice of 11 November 1918.

===Post-war===
The division suffered 995 killed and 7,082 wounded, for a total of 8,077 casualties. Following the war&#x27;s end, the division moved to training areas near Prauthoy, where it remained through February 1919. It returned to the United States in April and May, and was demobilized and deactivated at Camp Mills, New York, on 27 May.

==Interwar period==

Pursuant to the National Defense Act of 1920, the 82nd Division was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, allotted to the Fourth Corps Area, assigned to the XIV Corps, and further allotted to Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina as its home area. The division headquarters was organized on 23 September 1921 at 1202-1/2 Main Street in Columbia, South Carolina, relocating in 1923 to the Post Office Building where it remained until activated for World War II.

The 82nd Division&#x27;s designated mobilization station was Camp McClellan, Alabama, also where much of the unit&#x27;s annual training activities occurred in the interwar years. The headquarters usually trained at Camp McClellan, but also occasionally trained with the staff of the 8th Infantry Brigade, 4th Division. The 82nd Division&#x27;s infantry regiments held their annual training primarily with the units of the 8th Infantry Brigade, while other units, such as the special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster units, usually trained alongside the active elements of the 4th Division at various posts in the Fourth Corps Area. For example, the division artillery trained with the units of the 13th Field Artillery Brigade at Fort Bragg, North Carolina; the 307th Engineer Regiment alongside Company A, 4th Engineer Regiment at Fort Benning, Georgia; the 307th Medical Regiment trained at the medical officers training camp at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia; and the 307th Observation Squadron with Air Corps units at Maxwell Field, Alabama.

The infantry regiments of the division rotated responsibility to conduct the Citizens&#x27; Military Training Camps each year at Camp McClellan. The division participated in Fourth Corps Area or Third Army command post exercises in conjunction with other Regular Army, National Guard and Organized Reserve units, but unlike Regular and Guard units, the 82nd Division did not participate as an organized unit in the Fourth Corps Area maneuvers and the Third Army maneuvers of 1938, 1940, and 1941 due to a lack of enlisted personnel and equipment, with the officers and a few enlisted reservists assigned to fill vacant slots in organized units to bring them to war strength for the exercises, with others assigned duties as umpires or support personnel.

==World War II==

===Initial training and conversion===

Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 tables of organization. The headquarters companies of the two infantry brigades were consolidated into the division&#x27;s cavalry reconnaissance troop, and one infantry regiment was removed by inactivation. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery, and its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split.

The 82nd Division was redesignated on 13 February 1942 as Division Headquarters, 82nd Division, and ordered into active service on 25 March 1942, at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana, under the command of Major General Omar N. Bradley. The officer and enlisted cadre mostly came from the 9th Infantry Division, while the enlisted fillers came from reception centers in the Midwest, South, and Southwest. During this period, the division brought together three officers who would ultimately steer the U.S. Army during the following two decades: Matthew Ridgway, James M. Gavin, and Maxwell D. Taylor. Under Major General Bradley, the 82nd Division&#x27;s Chief of Staff was George Van Pope.

On 15 August 1942, the 82nd Infantry Division, now commanded by Major General Ridgway, became the first airborne division in the history of the U.S. Army, and was redesignated as the 82nd Airborne Division. The 82nd was selected after deliberations by the U.S. Army General Staff because of a number of factors; it was not a Regular Army or National Guard unit (historian John B. Wilson wrote that &quot;many traditionalists in those components wanted nothing to do with such an experimental force,&quot; while James M. Gavin wrote that many states would refuse the conversion of their National Guard units, likely because of the additional expenses needed to maintain facilities for airborne units), its personnel had all completed basic training, and it was stationed in an area that had good weather and flying facilities. The division initially consisted of the 325th, 326th and 327th Infantry Regiments, and supporting units. The 327th was soon transferred to help form the 101st Airborne Division and was replaced by the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, leaving the division with two regiments of glider infantry and one of parachute infantry. In February 1943 the division received another change when the 326th was transferred to the 13th Airborne Division, being replaced by the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, under James M. Gavin, then a colonel, who was later to command the division.

===North Africa and Italy===
In April 1943, paratroopers from the 82nd, under the command of Major General Ridgway, sailed into the Mediterranean Theater of Operations and landed in North Africa as part of the Allied plan to invade Sicily. The division&#x27;s first two combat operations were parachute assaults into Sicily on July 9 and Salerno on 13 September 1943. The initial assault on Sicily, by the 505th Parachute Regimental Combat Team, under Colonel Gavin, was the first regimental-sized combat parachute assault conducted by the United States Army. The first glider assault did not occur until Operation Neptune as part of the D-Day landings of 6 June 1944. Troopers arrived in Italy by landing craft at Maiori, Naples, and Salerno.

During the invasion of Italy, Ridgway considered Will Lang Jr. of &quot;TIME&quot; magazine an honorary member of the division.

In January 1944, the 504th, commanded by Colonel Reuben Tucker, which was temporarily detached to fight at Anzio, adopted the nickname &quot;Devils in Baggy Pants&quot;, taken from an entry in a German officer&#x27;s diary.

===Normandy===
With two air drops under its belt, the 82nd Airborne was ready for the second &quot;D-Day&quot; operation in the division&#x27;s history; Operation Neptune, or the amphibious assault portion of Allied invasion of Normandy. The division conducted Mission Boston, a component of the Operation Overlord plan.

In preparation for the operation, the division was significantly reorganized. To ease the integration of replacement troops, rest, and refitting following the fighting in Italy, the 504th PIR did not rejoin the division for the invasion. Two new parachute infantry regiments (PIRs), the 507th and the 508th, provided it, along with the veteran 505th, a three-parachute infantry regiment punch. The 325th was also reinforced by the addition of the 3rd Battalion of the 401st GIR, bringing it up to a strength of three battalions.

On 5 and 6 June these paratroopers, parachute artillery elements, and the 319th and 320th, boarded hundreds of transport planes and gliders to begin history&#x27;s largest airborne assault at the time (only Operation Market Garden later that year would be larger). During the June 6th assault, a 508th platoon leader, First Lieutenant Robert P. Mathias, would be the first U.S. Army officer killed by German fire during the invasion. On 7June, after this first wave of attack, the 325th GIR would arrive by glider to provide a division reserve.

In Normandy, the 82nd gained its first Medal of Honor of the war, belonging to Private First Class Charles N. DeGlopper of the 325th GIR. When the division was relieved in early July, the 82nd had seen a month straight of severe combat. Casualties had been heavy. Losses included 5,245 troopers killed, wounded, or missing- a 46% casualty rate. Major General Ridgway&#x27;s post-battle report stated in part, &quot;... 33 days of action without relief, without replacements. Every mission accomplished. No ground gained was ever relinquished.&quot;

Following Normandy, the 82nd Airborne Division returned to England to rest and refit for future airborne operations. The 82nd became part of the newly organized XVIII Airborne Corps, which consisted of the 17th, 82nd, and 101st Airborne Divisions. Ridgway was given command of the corps but was not officially promoted to lieutenant general until 1945. His recommendation for succession as division commander was Brigadier General James M. Gavin, previously the 82nd&#x27;s assistant division commander. Upon being promoted to Major General in October 1944 at the age of 37, Gavin became the youngest general since the Civil War to command a U.S. Army division.

===Market Garden===

On August 2, 1944, the division became part of the First Allied Airborne Army. In September, planning for Operation Market Garden (the Allied invasion of the Netherlands) began in earnest. The operation called for three (at minimum) airborne divisions to seize and hold key bridges and roads deep behind German lines. The 504th PIR, now back at full strength, was reassigned to the 82nd, while the 507th was assigned to the 17th Airborne Division, at the time training in England.
On 17 September, the &quot;All American&quot; Division conducted its fourth (and final) combat jump of World War II. Fighting off German counterattacks, the division captured its objectives between Grave, and Nijmegen. The division failed to initially capture Nijmegen Bridge when the opportunity presented itself early in the battle. When the British XXX Corps arrived in Nijmegen, six hours ahead of schedule, they found themselves having to fight to take a bridge that should have already been in allied hands. In the afternoon of Wednesday 20 September 1944, the 82nd Airborne Division successfully conducted an opposed assault crossing of the Waal river. War correspondent Bill Downs, who witnessed the assault, described it as &quot;a single, isolated battle that ranks in magnificence and courage with Guam, Tarawa, Omaha Beach. A story that should be told to the blowing of bugles and the beating of drums for the men whose bravery made the capture of this crossing over the Waal possible.&quot;

The Market Garden salient was held in a defensive operation for several weeks until the 82nd was relieved by Canadian troops, and sent into reserve in France. During the operation, 19-year-old Private John R. Towle of the 504th PIR was posthumously awarded the 82nd Airborne Division&#x27;s second Medal of Honor of World War II.

===The Bulge===
On 16 December 1944, the Germans launched a surprise offensive through the Ardennes Forest, which became known as the Battle of the Bulge. In SHAEF reserve, the 82nd was committed on the northern face of the bulge near Elsenborn Ridge.

On 20 December 1944, the 82nd Airborne Division was assigned to take Cheneux which had been captured by Kampfgruppe Peiper. On 21–22 December 1944, the 82nd Airborne faced counterattacks from two Waffen SS divisions which included the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (&quot;lit. translation&quot; &quot;The SS Bodyguard Division of Adolf Hitler&quot;) and the 9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen. The Waffen SS efforts to relieve the Kampfgruppe Peiper failed due to the stubborn defense of the 82nd Airborne, the 30th ID, 2nd ID, and other units.

On 23 December, the Germans attacked from the south and overran the 325th GIR holding the Baraque- Fraiture crossroads on the 82nd&#x27;s southern flank, endangering the entire 82nd Airborne division. The 2nd SS Panzers objective was to outflank the 82nd Airborne. It was not an attack designed to reach Peiper, but it was his last chance, nonetheless. If it did outflank the 82nd, it could have opened a corridor and reached the stranded yet still powerful Kampfgruppe. But the attack came too late.

On 24 December 1944, the 82nd Airborne Division with an official strength of 8,520 men was facing off against a vastly superior combined force of 43,000 men and over 1,200 armored fighting and artillery vehicles and pieces. Due to these circumstances, the 82nd Airborne Division was forced to withdrawal for the first time in its combat history. The Germans pursued their retreat with the 2nd and 9th SS Panzer Divisions. The 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich engaged the 82nd until 28 December when it and what was left of the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte were ordered to move south to meet General George Patton&#x27;s forces attacking in the area of Bastogne. Some units of the 9th SS Panzer including the 19th Panzer Grenadier Regiment stayed and fought the 82nd. They were joined by the 62nd Volksgrenadier Division. The 9th SS Panzer tried to breakthrough by attacking the 508 and 504 PIR positions, but ultimately failed. The failure of the 9th and 2nd SS Panzer Divisions to break through the 82nd lines marked the end of the German offensive in the northern shoulder of the Bulge. The German objective now became one of defense.

On 3 January 1945, the 82nd Airborne Division conducted a counterattack. On the first day&#x27;s fighting the 82nd Airborne overran the 62nd Volksgrenadiers and the 9th SS Panzer&#x27;s positions capturing 2,400 prisoners. The 82nd Airborne suffered high casualties in the process. The attached 551st Parachute Infantry Battalion was all but destroyed during these attacks. Of the 826 men who went into the Ardennes, only 110 came out. Having lost its charismatic leader Lt. Colonel Joerg, and almost all its men either wounded, killed, or frostbitten, the 551 was never reconstituted. The few soldiers who remained were later absorbed into units of the 82nd Airborne.

After several days of fighting, the destruction of the 62nd Volksgrenadiers, and what had been left of the 9th SS Panzer Division was complete. For the 82nd Airborne Division the first part of the Battle of the Bulge had ended.

===Into Germany===

After helping to secure the Ruhr, the 82nd Airborne Division took over Ludwigslust past the Elbe River, accepting the surrender of over 150,000 men of Lieutenant General Kurt von Tippelskirch&#x27;s 21st Army on 2 May 1945. General Omar Bradley, commanding the U.S. 12th Army Group, stated in a 1975 interview with Gavin that Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, commanding the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group, had told him that German opposition was too great to cross the Elbe. When Gavin&#x27;s 82nd crossed the river, in company with the British 6th Airborne Division, the 82nd Airborne Division moved 36 miles in one day and captured over 100,000 troops, causing great laughter in Bradley&#x27;s 12th Army Group headquarters.

Following Germany&#x27;s surrender, the 82nd Airborne Division entered Berlin for occupation duty, replacing the 2nd Armored Division in August 1945. The division was relieved by the 78th Infantry Division early in November 1945. While in Berlin, General George S. Patton was so impressed with the 82nd&#x27;s &quot;honor guard&quot; that he said, &quot;In all my years in the Army and all the honor guards I have ever seen, the 82nd&#x27;s honor guard is undoubtedly the best.&quot; Hence the &quot;All-American&quot; became also known as &quot;America&#x27;s Guard of Honor&quot;. The war ended before their scheduled participation in the Allied invasion of Japan, Operation Downfall.

==Cold War==
===Post–World War II===

The 82nd Airborne division returned to the United States on 3 January 1946 on the . The 82nd initially was staged at Camp Shanks, New York, where they drilled for the coming Victory Parade, to be held in New York City on January 12, 1946. In 1947 the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion was assigned to the 82nd and was reflagged as the 3d Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment (redesignated as the 505th Airborne Infantry Regiment effective 15 December 1947). Instead of being demobilized, the 82nd found a permanent home at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, designated a Regular Army division on 15 November 1948. The 82nd was not sent to the Korean War, as both Presidents Truman and Eisenhower chose to keep it in strategic reserve in the event of a Soviet ground attack anywhere in the world. Life in the 82nd during the 1950s and 1960s consisted of intensive training exercises in all environments and locations, including Panama, the Far East, and the continental United States.

===Pentomic organization===
In 1957, the division implemented the pentomic organization (officially Reorganization of the Airborne Division (ROTAD)) in order to better prepare for tactical nuclear war in Europe. Five battle groups (each with a headquarters and service company, five rifle companies and a mortar battery) replaced the division&#x27;s three regiments of three battalions each. The division&#x27;s battle groups were:
* 1st Airborne Battle Group (ABG), 187th Infantry (reassigned from the 24th Infantry Division on 8February 1959)(1)
* 1st ABG, 325th Infantry
* 2nd ABG, 501st Infantry
* 1st ABG, 503d Infantry (reassigned from the 24th Infantry Division on 1July 1958)(2)
* 2nd ABG, 503rd Infantry (reassigned to the 25th Infantry Division on 24 June 1960)
* 1st ABG, 504th Infantry (reassigned to the 8th Infantry Division on 11 December 1958)
* 2nd ABG, 504th Infantry (assigned effective 9May 1960)(1)
* 1st ABG, 505th Infantry (reassigned to the 8th Infantry Division on 15 January 1959)
::(1) 1st ABG, 504th Infantry and 1st ABG, 505th Infantry were reassigned to the 8th Infantry Division in central West Germany to provide airborne capability in Germany; in turn, 1–187th and 1-503d were reassigned from the 24th Infantry Division in southern Germany to the 82nd Airborne Division
::(2) 2nd ABG, 503rd Infantry was reassigned to the 25th Infantry Division and stationed in Okinawa to provide airborne capability in the Pacific on 24 June 1960. This ABG was reassigned to the 173d Airborne Brigade on 26 March 1963.
* the Division Artillery consisted of:
** Battery A, 319th Artillery
** Battery B, 319th Artillery
** Battery C, 319th Artillery (Battery C, 320th Artillery after 1960; C-319th accompanied the 2d ABG, 503d Infantry on its assignment to the 25th Infantry Division)
** Battery D, 320th Artillery
** Battery E, 320th Artillery
** Battery B, 377th Artillery
* additional division elements consisted of:
** 82nd Medical Company
** 82nd Signal Battalion
** 82nd Aviation Company
** Troop A, 17th Cavalry
** 307th Airborne Engineer Battalion
** 407th Supply and Transportation Battalion (The 82nd Quartermaster Parachute Supply and Maintenance Company [activated 1March 1945] was reorganized and redesignated as Company B, 407th S&amp;T Battalion.)
** 782nd Maintenance Battalion

The pentomic organization was unsuccessful, and the division reorganized into three brigades of three battalions (the Reorganization Objective Army Division (ROAD) organization) in 1964.

===Dominican Republic and Vietnam deployments===
In April 1965, the &quot;All-Americans&quot; invaded the Dominican Republic. Spearheaded by the 3rd Brigade, the 82nd deployed in Operation Power Pack.

During the Tet Offensive, which swept across South Vietnam in January/February 1968, the 3rd Brigade was en route to Chu Lai within 24 hours of receiving its orders. The 3rd Brigade performed combat duties in the Huế – Phu Bai area of the I Corps sector. Later the brigade moved south to Saigon, and fought in the Mekong Delta, the Iron Triangle and along the Cambodian border, serving nearly 22 months. While the 3rd Brigade was deployed, the division created a provisional 4th Brigade, consisting of 4th Battalion, 325th Infantry; 3d Battalion, 504th Infantry; and 3d Battalion, 505th Infantry. An additional unit, the 3d Battalion, 320th Artillery, was activated under Division Artillery to support the 4th Brigade.

The units assigned and attached to the 3d Brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division were as follows:
* Brigade Infantry:
** 1st Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry
** 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry
** 1st Battalion (Airborne), 508th Infantry
* Brigade Artillery:
** 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 321st Artillery (105mm)
* Brigade Aviation:
** Company A, 82nd Aviation Battalion
* Brigade Reconnaissance:
** Troop B, 1st Squadron (Armored), 17th Cavalry
** Company O (Ranger), 75th Infantry
* Brigade Support:
** 82nd Support Battalion
** 58th Signal Company
** Company C, 307th Engineer Battalion (Airborne)
** 408th Army Security Agency Detachment
** 52nd Chemical Detachment
** 518th Military Intelligence Detachment
** 307th Medical (Airborne) Headquarters and Alpha Company

The deployment of the 3rd Brigade took place with significant problems and controversy. In &quot;The Rise and Fall of an American Army: U.S. Ground Forces in Vietnam, 1965–1973,&quot; author Shelby L. Stanton describes how, other than the 82nd, only two under-strength Marine and four skeletonized Army divisions were left stateside by the beginning of 1968. MACV, desperate for additional manpower, wanted the division to deploy to Vietnam, and the Department of the Army, wishing to retain its &quot;sole readily deployable strategic reserve, the last real vestige of actual Army divisional combat potency in the United States left to the Pentagon,&quot; compromised by sending the 3d Brigade. As Stanton wrote:

The division had been so rushed to get this brigade to the battlefront that it ignored individual deployment criteria. Paratroopers who had just returned from Vietnam now found themselves suddenly going back. The howl of soldier complaints was so vehement that the Department of the Army was soon forced to give each trooper who had deployed to Vietnam with the 3d Brigade the option of returning to Fort Bragg or remaining with the unit. To compensate for the abrupt departures from home for those who elected to stay with the unit, the Army authorized a month leave at the soldiers&#x27; own expense or a two-week leave with government aircraft provided for special flights back to North Carolina. Of the 3,650 paratroopers who had deployed from Fort Bragg, 2,513 elected to return to the United States at once. MACV had no paratroopers to replace them, and overnight the brigade was transformed into a separate light infantry brigade, airborne in name only.

===Urban riots in 1967–68===
==== 1967 Detroit riot ====

On 24 July 1967, shortly before midnight, President Lyndon B. Johnson ordered the U.S. military to occupy Detroit. At 1:10 a.m., 4,700 paratroopers of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, under the command of Lieutenant General John L. Throckmorton, arrived in Detroit and began working in the streets, coordinating refuse removal, tracing persons who had disappeared in the confusion, and carrying out routine military functions, such as the establishment of mobile patrols, guard posts, and roadblocks.

Rioting peaked in high intensity. The 82nd worked alongside the 101st to secure east of Woodward, while the National Guard took land west of Woodward. &quot;Incidents&quot; began to decline as paratroopers constantly patrolled the perimeter with M16 rifles, M60 machine guns, and M48 tanks, while the police began making arrests on those violating curfew regulations or who were caught looting. On 27 July, with a sense of normalcy returned to the city, in part due to the presence of Army and National Guard troops, and the riot was officially declared over. The Army began to scale down in order to return to their normal duties, relinquishing control to local authorities.

Although Army paratroopers exercised some restraint on firepower due to being racially integrated, as well as their combat experience in Vietnam (as opposed to the mainly white and inexperienced National Guard troops), the 82nd was directly responsible for at least one death. On 29 July, two days after the riot officially ended, 82nd Captain Randolph Smith fatally shot Ernest Roquemore, a 19-year-old black man carrying a transistor radio. Three other individuals were injured by shotgun fire from police in the same incident. The Army and Detroit Police were on a joint patrol in order to recover looted items within the vicinity.

On 30 July, the 82nd and the 101st completely left Detroit and moved back to Selfridge for redeployment to their home stations, a process that continued gradually until August 2.

====1968 riots in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore====

The 82nd was called in to tackle civil disturbances in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore in the wake of the nationwide riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. on 4 April 1968. In Washington, D.C., the first of 21 aircraft carrying the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 82nd landed at Andrews Air Force Base on 6 April, with the 82nd&#x27;s 2nd Brigade Combat Team joining up later. In total, more than 2,000 82nd paratroopers were among the 11,850 federal troops to assist the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia and the D.C. Army National Guard in Washington. By then, the rioting had largely ended, but isolated looting and arson continued for a few more days. On 8 April, when D.C. was considered pacified, the 1st Brigade was later moved to Baltimore in assisting the Maryland National Guard and the Baltimore Police Department because of the ongoing city&#x27;s disorder there, leaving the 2nd Brigade the only 82nd unit in Washington.

The 82nd brigades in D.C. and Baltimore worked with other federal, state, and local forces in maintaining order, detaining looters, clearing any signs of trouble, assisting crews clearing debris from the main traffic arteries, and helping sanitation, food store, and public utility employees to restore essential services within devastated areas. On 12 April, orders were issued for federal troops and National Guardsmen stationed in both cities to return to their home stations. The 1st Brigade was among the federal forces that left Baltimore by midnight the same day and three days later, the 2nd Brigade went into an assembly area at Bolling Air Force Base, where they eventually departed back to Fort Bragg sometime later.

===Post-Vietnam Operations===

From 1969 into the 1970s, the 82nd deployed paratroopers to South Korea and Vietnam on more than 180DBT (Days Bad Time) for exercises in potential future battlegrounds. The division received three alerts. One was for Black September 1970. Paratroopers were on their way to Amman, Jordan when the mission was aborted. In May 1971 they were used to help national guard and Washington DC police to round up and arrest protestors. Nine years later in August 1980, the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry was alerted and deployed to conduct civil disturbance duty at Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania, during the Cuban refugee internment. War in the Middle East in the fall of 1973 brought the 82nd to full alert. President Gerald Ford put the unit on high alert in case the administration decided to intervene in the Boston desegregation busing crisis. In May 1978, the division was alerted to a possible drop into Zaire. In November 1979, the division was alerted for a possible operation to rescue the American hostages in Iran. The division formed the nucleus of the newly created Rapid Deployment Forces (RDF), a mobile force at a permanently high state of readiness.

===Invasion of Grenada – Operation Urgent Fury===


On 25 October 1983, elements of the 82nd conducted an Airland Operation to secure Point Salines Airport following an airborne assault by the 1st and 2nd Ranger Battalions who conducted the airfield seizure just hours prior. The first 82nd unit to deploy was a task force of the 2d and 3d Battalions (Airborne), 325th Infantry. On 26 October and 27, the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry, and the 1st and 2nd Battalions (Airborne), 508th Infantry, deployed to Grenada with support units. 2-505 deployed as well. Military operations ended in early November (Note: that C/2-325 did not deploy due to being a newly formed COHORT unit, in its place B/2-505 deployed, landing at Point Salines. The 82nd expanded its missions from the airhead at Salines to weed out Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces and Grenadan People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army soldiers Each proceeding battalion pushed a single company forward with A/2-504 deploying only one company out of the entire brigade. The operation was flawed in several areas and identified areas needing attention to enhance the United States RDF doctrine. Newly issued Battledress Uniforms (BDUs) were not designed for the tropical environment; communication between Army ground forces and Navy and Air Force aircraft lacked interoperability and even food and other logistic support to ground forces were hampered due to communication issues between the services. The operation proved the division&#x27;s ability to act as a rapid deployment force. The first aircraft carrying troopers from the 2–325th touched down at Point Salines 17 hours after H-Hour notification.

In March 1988, a brigade task force made up of two battalions from the 504th Infantry and 3d Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry, conducted a parachute insertion and air/land operation into Honduras as part of Operation Golden Pheasant. The deployment was billed as a joint training exercise, but the paratroopers were ready to fight. The deployment caused the Sandinistas to withdraw to Nicaragua. Operation Golden Pheasant prepared the paratroopers for future combat in an increasingly unstable world.

===Panama: Operation Just Cause===
On 20 December 1989, the &quot;All-American&quot;, as part of the United States invasion of Panama, conducted their first combat jump since World War II onto Torrijos International Airport, Panama. The goal of the 1st Brigade task force, which was made up of the 1–504th and 2–504th INF as well as 4–325th INF and Company A, 3–505th INF, and 3–319th FAR, was to oust Manuel Noriega from power. They were joined on the ground by 3–504th INF, which was already in Panama. The invasion was initiated with a night combat jump and airfield seizures; the 82nd conducted follow-on combat air assault missions in Panama City and the surrounding areas of the Gatun Locks. The operation continued with an assault of multiple strategic installations, such as the Punta Paitilla Airport in Panama City and a Panamanian Defense Forces (PDF) garrison and airfield at Rio Hato, where Noriega also maintained a residence. The attack on La Comandancia (PDF HQ) touched off several fires, one of which destroyed most of the adjoining and heavily populated El Chorrillo neighborhood in downtown Panama City. The 82nd Airborne Division secured several other key objectives such as Madden Dam, El Ranacer Prison, Gatun Locks, Gamboa and Fort Cimarron. Overall, the operation involved 27,684 U.S. troops and over 300 aircraft, including C-130 Hercules, AC-130 Spectre gunship, OA-37B Dragonfly observation, and attack aircraft, C-141 and C-5 strategic transports, F-117A Nighthawk stealth aircraft and AH-64 Apache attack helicopters. The invasion of Panama was the first combat deployment for the AH-64, the HMMWV, and the F-117A. In the short six years since the Invasion of Grenada, Operation Just Cause demonstrated how quickly the US Armed Forces could adapt and overcome the mistakes and equipment interoperability issues to conduct a quick and decisive victory. In all, the 82nd Airborne Division suffered six of the 23 fatalities of the operation. The paratroopers began redeployment to Fort Bragg on 12 January 1990. Operation Just Cause concluded on 31 Jan 1990, just 42 days (D+42) since the invasion started.

===Persian Gulf War===
Seven months later the paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division were again called to war. Four days after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on 2August 1990, the 4th Battalion (Airborne), 325th Infantry was the Division Ready Force1 (DRF-1) and the initial ground force invaded Iraq on the orders of President George Bush Sr. after his &quot;Line in the Sand&quot; speech to Saddam Hussein part of the largest deployment of American troops since Vietnam as part of &quot;Operation Desert Shield.&quot; The 4–325th INF immediately deployed to Riyadh and Thummim, Saudi Arabia. Their role was to guard the royal family as part of the agreement with King Fahd to station troops in and around the kingdom. The DRF2 and3 (1–325 and 2-325 INF, respectively) began drawing the &quot;line in the sand&quot; near al Jubail by building defenses for possible retrograde operations. Soon after, the rest of the division followed. There, intensive intelligence operations began in anticipation of desert fighting against the heavily armored Iraqi Army.

On 16 January 1991, Operation Desert Storm began when American war planes attacked Iraqi targets. As the air war began, 2nd Brigade of the 82nd initially deployed near an airfield in the vicinity of the ARAMCO oil facilities outside Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia. While 1st Brigade and 3d Brigade consolidated at the Division HQ (CHAMPION Main) near Dhahran in Coinciding with the start of the air war, three National Guard Light-Medium Truck companies, the 253d (NJARNG), 1122d (AKARNG), and the 1058th (MAARNG) joined 2d Brigade of the 82nd. In the coming weeks using primarily the 5-Ton cargo trucks of these NG truck companies, the 1st Brigade moved north to &quot;tap line road&quot; in the vicinity of Rafha, Saudi Arabia. Eventually, these National Guard truck units effectively &quot;motorized&quot; the 325th Infantry, providing the troop ground transportation required for them to keep pace with the French Division Daguet during the invasion. Extensive ground operations began almost six weeks later.

The 2–325th INF was the division&#x27;s spearhead for the ground war who took positions over the Iraqi border 24 hours in advance of U.N. coalition forces at 8:00 a.m., February 22, 1991, on Objectives Tin Man and Rochambeau. On 23 February, 82nd Airborne Division paratroopers protected the XVIII Airborne Corps flank as fast-moving armor and mechanized units moved deep inside south-western Iraq. After the second day, the 1st Brigade moved forward to extend the Corps flank along with 3d Brigade. The 82nd drove deep into Iraq and captured thousands of Iraqi soldiers and tons of equipment, weapons, and ammunition. During that time, the 82nd&#x27;s band and MP company processed 2,721 prisoners. After the liberation of Kuwait and the surrender of the Iraqi Army, the 82nd redeployed to Fort Bragg.

===Hurricane Andrew===

In August 1992, the 82nd Airborne deployed a task force to the hurricane-ravaged area of South Florida to provide so-called &quot;humanitarian assistance&quot; following Hurricane Andrew. For more than 30 days, troopers provided food, shelter and medical attention to the Florida population as part of the U.S. military Domestic Emergency Planning System. The 82nd was part of over 20,000 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine, Coast Guard and an additional 6200 National Guard troops deployed for the disaster.

They also provided security and a sense of safety for the victims of the storm who were without power, doors, windows and in many cases roofs. The 82nd Airborne were deployed to &quot;eliminate&quot; what were officially designated &quot;looters and thieves.&quot;

== Post–Cold War == 

===Operation Uphold Democracy: Haiti===

On 16 September 1994, the 82nd Airborne Division joined Operation Uphold Democracy. The 82nd was scheduled to make combat parachute jumps into Pegasus Drop Zone and PAPIAP Drop Zone (Port-au-Prince Airport), in order to help oust Raoul Cédras and to restore Jean-Bertrand Aristide to the presidency. At the same time, former U.S. president Jimmy Carter and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell were negotiating with Cédras to restore Aristide to power, the 82nd&#x27;s first wave was in the air, with paratroopers waiting at Green Ramp to air-land in Haïti once the airfields there had been seized. When the Haitian military verified from sources outside Pope Air Force Base that the 82nd was on the way, Cédras stepped down, averting the invasion.

Former vice president Al Gore would later travel to Fort Bragg to personally thank the paratroopers of the 82nd for their actions, noting in a speech on 19 September 1994, that the 82nd&#x27;s reputation was enough to change Cédras&#x27; mind:

===Operations Safe Haven and Safe Passage===

On 12 December 1994, the 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry, with the 2nd Platoon of Company C, 307th Engineer Battalion, deployed as part of Operations Safe Haven and Safe Passage. The battalion deployed from Fort Bragg &quot;to restore order&quot; against what American officials termed &quot;Cuban refugees&quot; who had attacked and injured a number of Air Force personnel and one marine while protesting their detainment at Empire Range along the Panama Canal. The battalion participated in the safeguarding of the Cuban refugees, a camp cordon and reorganization, and the active patrolling in and around the refugee camps in and around the Panamanian jungle along the Panama canal for two months. General Engineering support in the area of camp establishment/improvement operations was provided by the Sappers of the habitually associated Task Force Panther Engineer platoon, 2/C-307th. (Task Force Panther was commanded by LTC Lloyd J. Austin III, who would later be the first African American General to commander of U.S. Central Command and U.S. Secretary of Defense.) This support included the planning of camp power requirements, pouring of 78 concrete pads, three-foot bridges, a set of &quot;mock doors&quot; for airborne pre-jump training, and a system of decks for the muddy camp. During the deployment, the paratroopers experienced a 92-degree Christmas Day and returned to Fort Bragg on 14 February 1995.

===Operation Joint Endeavor: Bosnia===

Battalions of the 82nd prepared for a possible parachute jump to support elements of the 1st Armored Division which had been ordered to Bosnia-Herzegovina as part of Operation Joint Endeavor. Only after engineers of the 1st Armored Division bridged the Sava River on 31 December 1995 without hostilities did the 82nd begin to draw down against plans for a possible airborne operation there. The 82nd&#x27;s 49th Public Affairs Detachment was deployed in support of the 1st Armored Division and air-landed in Tuzla with the 1AD TAC CP and began PA operations to include establishing the first communications in print and radio and covering the crossing of the Sava River by the main forces.

===Centrazbat &#x27;97===

In September 1997 the 82nd traveled to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan for CENTRAZBAT &#x27;97. Paratroopers from Ft. Bragg, NC flew 8000 miles on U.S. Air Force C-17s and jumped into an airfield in Shimkent, Kazakhstan. Forty soldiers from the three republics joined 500 paratroopers on the exercise-opening jump. Marine Gen. John Sheehan, then-commander in chief of the Atlantic Command, was first out of the aircraft. The 82nd joined units from Kyrgyzstan, Turkey, and Russia in the two-week-long NATO training mission. Members of the international press and local reporters from WRAL-TV and the Fayetteville Observer were also embedded with the 82nd Airborne.

===Operation Allied Force: Kosovo===

In March 1999 the TF 2–505th INF deployed to Albania and forward-deployed along the Albania/Kosovo border in support of Operation Allied Force, NATO&#x27;s bombing campaign against Serbian forces in the former Yugoslav Republic. In September 1999, TF 3–504th INF deployed in support of Operation Joint Guardian, replacing TF 2–505th INF. TF 3–504th INF was replaced in March 2000 by elements of the 101st Airborne Division. On 1October 1999, the 1–508th ABCT (SETAF) made a combat jump in &quot;Operation Rapid Guardian&quot;: 500-foot altitude jump near Pristina.

==Global War on Terror==
===Operation Enduring Freedom II &amp; III, 2002–2003===

After 11 September attacks on the United States, the 82nd&#x27;s 49th Public Affairs Detachment deployed to Afghanistan in October 2001 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom along with several individual 82nd soldiers who deployed to the Central Command area of responsibility to support combat operations.

In June 2002, elements of the division headquarters and TF Panther (HQ 3d Brigade; 1–504th INF, 1–505th INF, 3–505th INF, 1–319th FA) deployed to Afghanistan. In January 2003, TF Devil (HQ 1st Brigade, 2–504th INF, 3–504th INF, 2–505th INF, 3–319th FA) relieved TF Panther.

===Operation Iraqi Freedom I, 2003–2004===
In March 2003, 2–325 of the 2nd BCT was attached to the 75th Ranger Regiment as part of a special operations task force to conduct a parachute assault to seize Saddam International Airport in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. On 21 March 2003, Company D, 2-325 crossed the Saudi Arabia–Iraq border as part of Task Force Hunter to escort HIMARS artillery systems to destroy Iraqi artillery batteries in the western Iraqi desert. Upon cancellation of the parachute assault to seize the airport, the battalion returned to its parent 2nd Brigade at Talil Airfield near An Nasariyah, Iraq. The 2nd Brigade then conducted operations in Samawah, Fallujah, and Baghdad. The brigade returned to the United States by the end of February 2004.

The early days of the 82nd Airborne&#x27;s participation in the deployment were chronicled by embedded journalist Karl Zinsmeister in his 2003 book &quot;Boots on the Ground: A Month with the 82nd Airborne in the Battle for Iraq&quot;.

In April 2003, according to Human Rights Watch, soldiers from a subordinate unit, the 1st battalion of the 325th Infantry, allegedly fired indiscriminately into a crowd of Iraqi civilians protesting their presence in the city of Fallujah, killing and wounding many civilians. The battalion suffered no casualties.

The 3rd Brigade deployed to Iraq in the summer, redeploying to the U.S. in spring 2004. The 1st Brigade deployed in January 2004. The last units of the division left by the end of April 2004. The 2nd Brigade deployed on 7December 2004 to support the free elections and returned on Easter Sunday in 2005. During this initial deployment, 36 soldiers from the division were killed and about 400 were wounded, out of about 12,000 deployed. On 21 July 2006, the 1st Battalion, 325th Infantry Regiment, along with a platoon from Battery A, 2nd Battalion, 319th Field Artillery Regiment and a troop from 1st Squadron, 73rd Cavalry Regiment deployed to Tikrit, Iraq, returning in December 2006.

==== Torture and Abuse at Camp Mercury ====
In September 2005, a Human Rights Watch report alleged that residents of Fallujah called the 1st Battalion, 504th Infantry Regiment &quot;the Murderous Maniacs,&quot; based on their treatment of Iraqis in detention. According to accounts of 82nd Airborne officers and NCOs, members of the battalion in 2003-2004 routinely used physical and mental torture as a means of intelligence gathering and for stress relief. According to the report, these battalion members estimated &quot;...that about half of the detainees at Camp Mercury were released because they were not involved in the insurgency, but they left with the physical and mental scars of torture.&quot; 

After reporting these abuses yet being ignored by his superiors for 17 months, the Captain took his allegations to three senior Republican senators—Bill Frist, John McCain, and John Warner—before the Army was finally compelled to launch an investigation. It was only after his report to the senators that action was taken. A staffer for one of them later told TIME magazine that the captain’s claims were “extremely credible.” The 1st Battalion, 504th Infantry Regiment&#x27;s torture and abuse of prisoners later inspired the passage of the Detainee Treatment Act, and the anonymous captain was later revealed to be Ian Fishback. 

When Ian Fishback passed away in 2021, Senator Dick Durbin called Ian Fishback a military hero, saying:

===Rapid deployment operations===

====Afghanistan====

In late September 2004 the National Command Authority alerted TF 1–505th INF for an emergency deployment to Afghanistan in support of that October&#x27;s elections.

====Iraq====

In December 2004, the task forces based on 2–325th AIR and 3–325th AIR were deployed to Iraq to provide security for the country&#x27;s national elections in which more than eight million Iraqis voted.

===Operation Enduring Freedom VI, 2005–2008===
The 1st Brigade of the 82nd deployed in April 2005 in support of OEF 6, and returned in April 2006. 1st Battalion, 325th Infantry Regiment deployed in support of OEF6 from July through November 2005.

In March 2006, 3rd Battalion (General Support), 82nd Aviation was selected to augment a special operations task force utilizing CH-47 Chinooks and UH-60 Black Hawks. The task force consisted of 75th Ranger Regiment, Special Forces, and 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne). 2007 February 18, seven soldiers from the task force died in a helicopter crash. The deployment would end a month later (March 2007).

In January 2007, then Maj. Gen. David M. Rodriguez deployed the division headquarters to Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan, accompanied by 4th BCT and the Aviation Brigade, as Commander, Combined Joint Task Force-82 (CJTF-82) and Regional Command – East for Operation Enduring Freedom VIII. The 3d BCT, 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) was extended for 120 days to increase the troop strength against the Taliban spring offensive. Extended to 15-month deployment, 4th BCT, which included 1–508th Infantry Regiment, 2–508th Infantry Regiment, and 4–73rd Cavalry Regiment, 2–321st Field Artillery, and 782nd Brigade Support Battalion, was commanded by then Col. Martin P. Schweitzer and remained in Khowst Province from January 2007 until April 2008. The 2–508th IR worked to establish and maintain firebases in and around the Ghazni province while actively patrolling their operational area. The 1–508 PIR served in Regional Command-South. Working mostly out of Kandahar province as the theater tactical force, they mentored the Afghan National Security Force (ANSF), conducting combined operations with both ANSF and NATO partners in the Helmand province. Supporting the division were the 36th Engineer Brigade, and the 43d Area Support Group.

===Hurricane Katrina===

The 82nd Airborne&#x27;s 3rd Brigade, 505th Infantry Regiment, and the division&#x27;s 319th Field Artillery Regiment along with supporting units deployed to support search-and-rescue / security operations in New Orleans, Louisiana after the city was flooded by Hurricane Katrina in September 2005. About 5,000 paratroopers commanded by Major General William B. Caldwell IV, operated out of New Orleans International Airport.

===Reorganization===

In January 2006, the division began reorganizing from a division based organization to a brigade combat team-based organization. Activated elements include a 4th Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division (1–508th INF, 2–508th INF, 4–73rd Cav (RSTA), 2–321st FA, 782nd BSB, and STB, 4th BCT) and the inactivation of the Division Artillery, 82nd Signal Battalion, 307th Engineer Battalion, and 313th Military Intelligence Battalion. The 82nd Division Support Command (DISCOM) was redesignated as the 82nd Sustainment Brigade. A pathfinder unit was reactivated within the 82nd when the Long Range Surveillance Detachment of the inactivating 313th Military Intelligence Battalion was transferred to the 2d Battalion, 82nd Aviation Regiment and converted to a pathfinder role as the battalion&#x27;s Company F.

===Operation Iraqi Freedom, 2006–2009, &quot;The Surge&quot;===

In December 2006, 2nd BCT deployed once again to Iraq in support of OIF. On 4January 2007, 2nd Brigade deployed to northern Bagdad in the Sumer and Talbiyah district, returning 8March 2008. On 4June 2007, 1st Brigade deployed to Southern Iraq, returning 15 July 2008. Since the deployment began, the division has lost 37 paratroopers. Since 11 September 2001, the division has lost 20 paratroopers in Afghanistan and 101 paratroopers in Iraq.
===Operation Enduring Freedom, 2007–2008===

In January 2007, then Maj. Gen. David M. Rodriguez deployed the division headquarters to Bagram, Afghanistan, accompanied by 4th BCT and the Aviation Brigade, as Commander, Combined Joint Task Force-82 (CJTF-82)and Regional Command – East for Operation Enduring Freedom VIII. The 3d BCT, 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) was extended for 120 days to increase the troop strength against the Taliban spring offensive. Extended to 15-month deployment, 4th BCT, which included 1–508th Infantry Regiment, 2–508th Infantry Regiment, and 4–73rd Cavalry Regiment, 2–321st Field Artillery, and 782nd Brigade Support Battalion, was commanded by then Col. Martin P. Schweitzer and remained in Khowst Province from January 2007 until April 2008. The 2–508th IR worked to establish and maintain firebases in and around the Ghazni province while actively patrolling their operational area. The 1–508 PIR served in Regional Command-South. Working mostly out of Kandahar province as the theater tactical force, they mentored the Afghan National Security Force (ANSF), conducting combined operations with both ANSF and NATO partners in the Helmand province. Supporting the division were the 36th Engineer Brigade, and the 43d Area Support Group.

===Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom and New Dawn, 2008–2011===
In December 2008, the 3d BCT deployed to Baghdad, Iraq and redeployed to Ft. Bragg in November 2009. In August 2009, 1st BCT deployed once again to Iraq and redeployed late July 2010.

During the months of August and September 2009, 4th BCT deployed again to Afghanistan and returned in August 2010 having lost 38 soldiers.

In May 2011 1–505 (Task Force 1 Panther) deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Dispersed throughout the country, 1st battalion was attached to various Special Operations elements. 1st battalion redeployed to Fort Bragg, NC in February 2012 having lost two paratroopers.

The 2d Brigade deployed to the Anbar Province in Iraq in May 2011 for the last time in support of Operation New Dawn with the mission to advise, train and assist the Iraqi Security Forces and lead the responsible withdrawal of U.S. Forces - Iraq. Elements of 2d Brigade were among the last US combat units to withdraw from Baghdad. The brigade suffered the loss of the last American service member in Iraq, SPC. David E. Hickman, on 14 November 2011. They were part of the long convoy of equipment and troops who exited Iraq into Kuwait as OIF came to an end.

===2010 Haiti earthquake – Operation Unified Response===

As part of Operation Unified Response, the 2d BCT, on rotation as the division&#x27;s Global Response Force, was alerted and deployed forces to Haiti later that same day for the mission to provide humanitarian assistance following the devastating earthquake in Haiti. Paratroopers distributed water and food during the 2010 Haiti earthquake relief.

Just two months following redeployment from Haiti in 2010, elements of 2d BCT (Red Falcons) deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom to serve as trainers for the Afghan National Security Forces. In October 2011, the Division Headquarters returned to Afghanistan, where they relieved the 10th Mountain Division as the Headquarters of Regional Command-South.

In February 2012, 4th BCT deployed to Kandahar province. Taliban commander Mullah Dadullah, formed an overwhelming force in Kandahar. Zhari district in southern Kandahar is where Dadullah was recruiting a high number of jihadists. 4th BCT of the 82nd held the 5-month siege from March 2012 to the end of July, witnessing some of the most intense combat since the initial deployments since 2001, 4th BCT inflicted massive casualties among the Taliban. Performing with an almost perfect strategic plan, 4th BCT drove Dadullah and his men out of Kandahar to the Northeastern province of Kunar, where Dadullah was killed by airstrikes.

As of April 2012, the 1st BCT was deployed to Afghanistan, operating in Ghazni Province, Regional Command-East. The paratroopers took control of Ghazni from the Polish Armed Forces, allowing the Polish Task Force White Eagle (:pl:Polski Kontyngent Wojskowy w Afganistanie) to consolidate around the provincial seat in northern Ghazni.

In June 2012, the 3rd Brigade Combat Team deployed as part of the Global Response Force (GRF) in support of heavy combat operations conducted by the 1st Infantry Division. The Brigade was spread across much of RC-East Afghanistan.

In December 2013, elements of the 4th Brigade deployed again to Afghanistan and they were joined by the 1st Brigade in spring 2014. Since 11 September 2001, the division has lost 106 paratroopers in Afghanistan and 139 paratroopers in Iraq.

===Operation Inherent Resolve===
On 19 December 2014, &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes,&quot; a daily military newspaper, announced 1,000 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne&#x27;s 3rd Brigade Combat Team would deploy to Iraq to train, advise, and assist Iraq&#x27;s Security Forces.

On 3 November 2016, it was reported that 1,700 soldiers from the 2d Brigade Combat Team will deploy to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility in Iraq, to take part in Operation Inherent Resolve. They will replace the 2d Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division and will advise and assist Iraqi Security Forces currently trying to retake Mosul from ISIS fighters.

On 27 March 2017, it was reported that 300 paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne&#x27;s 2nd Brigade Combat Team will temporarily deploy to northern Iraq to provide additional advise-and-assist combating ISIS, particularly to speed up the offensive against ISIS in Mosul.

On 31 December 2019, approximately 750 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne&#x27;s Immediate Response Force were authorized to be deployed to Iraq in response to events which saw the United States&#x27; embassy in the country stormed.

From the start of January 2017 to September 2017, the division suffered the loss of five paratroopers killed in action.

====Syria intervention====
It was confirmed in July 2020 that the 82nd Airborne Division did in fact have combat deployments in Syria.

===Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel===

The 1st BCT deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel from June 2017 to March 2018. Two soldiers were killed in action when their convoy was purposefully hit by a vehicle filled with explosives.

The 3rd BCT deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel from July 2019 to March 2020. In February 2020 soldiers from the 1st BCT, 10th Mountain Division were deployed to Afghanistan to replace the 3rd BCT as part of a unit rotation.

===Iranian threat in Iraq===
The 82nd Airborne was called to deploy in Iraq upon after rioting civilians outside of the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, Iraq breached the outer gates of the Green Zone. On 1 January 2020, the first 750 troops began mobilizing to Kuwait and bases in the Baghdad area. On the direct orders of Donald Trump, Iranian general and Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani was killed in a U.S. airstrike at the Baghdad airport. Iranian influence on Iraqi militia groups was believed to play a part in the rioting at the U.S. embassy. Actions by the Iranians and the U.S. have increased tensions in the region not seen since before the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The 82nd airborne was among the first military units to be mobilized in response to this escalation and tensions. An additional 3,500 to 4,000 troops were ordered to deploy to Kuwait in response to Iranian threats in the region.

===Evacuation of Kabul===
In August 2021, elements of the 82nd Airborne Division, particularly the Immediate Response Force, deployed to Afghanistan to secure the evacuation of American diplomats and Afghan Special Immigrant Visa applicants as the Taliban seized land and converged on Kabul. Throughout Operation Allies Refuge, the 82nd Airborne Division served as the Operational Command, Task Force 82.

Operation Allies Refuge, led by Major General Chris Donahue, was a combined and joint NATO command post composed of forces representing NATO allied Nations, 1st Brigade Combat Team &quot;Devil&quot;, aviation capabilities from the 82nd Combat Aviation Brigade &quot;Pegasus&quot;, medical capabilities from the 44th Medical Brigade, riot control capabilities from the 16th Military Police Brigade, 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, and the 3rd Expeditionary Sustainment Command who oversaw sustainment in the joint operational area from a command post in Kuwait.

<text>Platoon is a 1986 American war film written and directed by Oliver Stone, starring Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, Charlie Sheen, Keith David, Kevin Dillon, John C. McGinley, Forest Whitaker, and Johnny Depp. It is the first film of a trilogy of Vietnam War films directed by Stone, followed by &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; (1989) and &quot;Heaven &amp; Earth&quot; (1993). The film, based on Stone&#x27;s experience from the war, follows a new U.S. Army volunteer (Sheen) serving in Vietnam while his Platoon Sergeant and his Squad Leader (Berenger and Dafoe) argue over the morality in the platoon and of the war itself.

Stone wrote the screenplay based upon his experiences as a U.S. infantryman in Vietnam, to counter the vision of the war portrayed in John Wayne&#x27;s &quot;The Green Berets&quot;. Although he wrote scripts for films such as &quot;Midnight Express&quot; and &quot;Scarface&quot;, Stone struggled to get the film developed until Hemdale Film Corporation acquired the project along with &quot;Salvador&quot;. Filming took place in the Philippines in February 1986 and lasted 54 days. &quot;Platoon&quot; was the first Hollywood film to be written and directed by a veteran of the Vietnam War.

Upon its release, &quot;Platoon&quot; received critical acclaim for Stone&#x27;s directing and screenplay, the cinematography, battle sequences&#x27; realism, and the performances of Sheen, Dafoe, and Berenger. The film was a box office success upon its release, grossing $138.5 million domestically against its $6 million budget, becoming the third highest-grossing domestic film of 1986. The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards at the 59th Academy Awards, and won four: Best Picture, Best Director for Stone, Best Sound, and Best Film Editing.

In 1998, the American Film Institute placed &quot;Platoon&quot; at #83 in their &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years ... 100 Movies&quot; poll. In 2019, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

In 1967, U.S. Army volunteer Chris Taylor arrives in South Vietnam and is assigned to an infantry platoon of the 25th Infantry Division near the Cambodian border. Though the platoon is officially under the command of the young and inexperienced Lieutenant Wolfe, the soldiers instead defer to two of his older and more experienced subordinates: the cynical Staff Sergeant Barnes, and the more compassionate Sergeant Elias.

Taylor is deployed with Barnes, Elias and other experienced soldiers for a night ambush on a North Vietnamese Army force. An NVA patrol appears, leading to a brief firefight. Taylor is wounded while another new recruit, Gardner, is killed. Upon his return to base from the aid station, Taylor bonds with Elias and his circle of marijuana smokers while remaining distant from Barnes and his more hard-edged followers.

During a subsequent patrol, two soldiers are killed by a booby trap and another by unseen assailants. Already on edge, the platoon is further angered when they discover an enemy supply cache in a nearby village. Barnes aggressively interrogates the village chief about whether the villagers have been aiding the NVA, and kills his wife when she confronts him. He then demands information from the chief while holding a gun to the head of the man&#x27;s young daughter. Elias arrives and, disgusted with Barnes, attacks him. Wolfe breaks up their fistfight. He orders the supplies destroyed and the village razed. Wolfe feigns ignorance when Elias accuses him of not stopping Barnes. Taylor prevents two girls from being gang-raped by some of Barnes&#x27; men.

When the platoon returns to base, company commander Captain Harris warns he will pursue a court-martial if he finds out an illegal killing occurred, leaving Barnes concerned that Elias will testify against him. On their next patrol, the platoon is ambushed and pinned down in a firefight, and the situation is worsened when Wolfe accidentally directs an artillery strike onto his own unit before Barnes calls it off. Elias takes Taylor, Rhah and Crawford to intercept flanking enemy troops, while Barnes orders the rest of the platoon to retreat and goes back into the jungle to find Elias&#x27; group. Barnes finds Elias alone and shoots him, then tells the others that Elias is dead. While the platoon is extracting via helicopter, they see a mortally wounded Elias emerge from the jungle being chased by NVA soldiers, who eventually kill him. Noticing Barnes’ anxious response, Taylor realizes he was responsible.

Back at base, Taylor attempts to talk his group into fragging Barnes in retaliation when Barnes, having overheard them, enters the room and mocks them. Taylor then assaults Barnes but is quickly overpowered, and Barnes cuts Taylor near his eye with a push dagger before departing.

The platoon is sent back to the front line to maintain defensive positions, where Taylor shares a foxhole with another soldier named Francis. That night, a major NVA assault occurs, and the defensive lines are broken. During the battle, much of the platoon, including Wolfe and most of Barnes&#x27; followers, are killed, while an NVA sapper destroys the battalion headquarters in a suicide attack. Now in command, Captain Harris orders an air strike to expend all remaining ordnance inside the perimeter. In the chaos, Taylor encounters Barnes, who has been seriously wounded. Just as Barnes is about to kill Taylor, both men are knocked unconscious by the ferocity of Harris&#x27; air strike.

Taylor regains consciousness the following morning, picks up an enemy rifle, and finds Barnes slowly crawling along the ground. Barnes orders him to call a medic, but Taylor does not respond. Barnes dares Taylor to kill him, and Taylor immediately shoots him dead. Francis, who has survived unharmed, stabs himself in the leg reminding Taylor that because they have been twice wounded, they can return home. As a helicopter carries the two men away, Taylor waves goodbye to Rhah. Command of the platoon is given to Sgt. O&#x27;Neill, a Barnes lackey who hid under a dead body during the battle. Overwhelmed, Taylor breaks down sobbing as he flies over multiple craters full of corpses, narrating how the war has changed him forever.

===Development===

The seeds of what would become &quot;Platoon&quot; began as early as 1968, months after Stone had completed his own tour of duty fighting in Vietnam. Stone first wrote a screenplay called &quot;Break&quot;, a semi-autobiographical account detailing his experiences with his parents and his time in the Vietnam War. Stone&#x27;s active duty service resulted in a &quot;big change&quot; in how he viewed life and the war. Although &quot;Break&quot; was never produced, he later used it as the basis for &quot;Platoon&quot;. His screenplay featured several characters who were the seeds of those he developed in &quot;Platoon&quot;. The script was set to music from The Doors; Stone sent the script to Jim Morrison in the hope he would play the lead. (Morrison never responded, but his manager returned the script to Stone shortly after Morrison&#x27;s death; Morrison had the script with him when he died in Paris.) Although &quot;Break&quot; was never produced, Stone decided to attend film school.

After writing several other screenplays in the early 1970s, Stone worked with Robert Bolt on the screenplay, &quot;The Cover-up&quot; (it was not produced). Bolt&#x27;s rigorous approach rubbed off on Stone. The younger man used his characters from the &quot;Break&quot; screenplay and developed a new screenplay, which he titled &quot;Platoon&quot;. Producer Martin Bregman attempted to elicit studio interest in the project, but was not successful. Stone claims that during that time, Sidney Lumet was to have helmed the film with Al Pacino slated to star had there been studio interest. But, based on the strength of his writing in &quot;Platoon,&quot; Stone was hired to write the screenplay for &quot;Midnight Express&quot; (1978).

The film was a critical and commercial success, as were some other Stone films at the time, but most studios were still reluctant to finance &quot;Platoon,&quot; because it was about the unpopular Vietnam War. After the release of &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; and &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, the studios then cited the perception that these films were considered the pinnacle of the Vietnam War film genre as reasons not to make &quot;Platoon&quot;.

Stone responded by attempting to break into mainstream direction via the easier-to-finance horror genre, but &quot;The Hand&quot; failed at the box office, and he began to think &quot;Platoon&quot; would never be made. Instead, he cowrote &quot;Year of the Dragon&quot; for a lower-than-usual fee of $200,000, on the condition from producer Dino De Laurentiis would next produce &quot;Platoon.&quot; &quot;Year of the Dragon&quot; was directed by Stone&#x27;s friend Michael Cimino, who had also helmed &quot;The Deer Hunter.&quot; According to Stone, Cimino attempted to produce &quot;Platoon&quot; in 1984.

The Department of Defense refused to support the production of the film due to its depiction of American war crimes, claiming the script was &quot;rife with unrealistic and highly unfavorable depictions of the American soldier&quot; for its depiction of the murder and rape of Vietnamese civilians by American soldiers, the attempted murder of one US soldier by another, drug abuse and portraying the majority of American soldiers as &quot;illiterate delinquents.&quot; The film was also accused of perpetuating racist stereotypes of African-American soldiers.

De Laurentiis secured financing for &quot;Platoon,&quot; but he struggled to find a distributor. Because De Laurentiis had already spent money sending Stone to the Philippines to scout for locations, he decided to keep control of the film&#x27;s script until he was repaid. Then Stone&#x27;s script for what would become &quot;Salvador&quot; was passed to John Daly of British production company Hemdale. Once again, this was a project that Stone had struggled to secure financing for, but Daly loved the script and was prepared to finance both &quot;Salvador&quot; and &quot;Platoon.&quot; Stone shot &quot;Salvador&quot; first, before turning his attention to &quot;Platoon&quot;.

===Casting===
James Woods, who had starred in Stone&#x27;s film &quot;Salvador&quot;, was offered the role of Barnes. Despite his friendship with the director, he turned it down, later teasingly saying he &quot;couldn&#x27;t face going into another jungle with [Oliver Stone]&quot;. Denzel Washington expressed interest in playing the role of Elias, a character Stone said was based on a soldier he knew in Vietnam. Stone confirmed in a 2011 interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that Mickey Rourke, Emilio Estevez and Kevin Costner were all considered for the part of Barnes. He believes Costner turned down the role &quot;because his brother had been in Vietnam.&quot; Stone also verified in the interview that Keanu Reeves turned down the role of Taylor because of the violence. Kyle MacLachlan also turned down the role of Taylor. Sheen said that he got the part of Taylor, because of Dafoe&#x27;s nod of approval. Jon Cryer auditioned for the role of Bunny, which eventually went to Kevin Dillon.

Many Vietnamese refugees living in the Philippines at the time were recruited to act in different Vietnamese roles in the film.

Stone makes a cameo appearance as the commander of the 3d Battalion, 22d Infantry in the final battle, which was based on the historic New Year&#x27;s Day Battle of 1968 in which he had taken part while on duty in South Vietnam. Dale Dye, who played Captain Harris, the commander of Company B, is a U.S. Marine Corps Vietnam War veteran who also served as the film&#x27;s technical advisor. The third US Army veteran who appears in the film is a member of the crew who was briefly seen shirtless in the climactic battle.

===Filming===
Exterior shooting began on the island of Luzon in the Philippines in February 1986, although the production was almost canceled because of the political upheaval in the country, due to then-president Ferdinand Marcos. With the help of well-known Asian producer Mark Hill, the shoot commenced, as scheduled, two days after Marcos fled the country. Shooting lasted 54 days and cost $6.5 million. The production made a deal with the Philippine military for the use of military equipment. Filming was done chronologically. As a result of the Department of Defense refusing to supply historically-accurate equipment and uniforms, the film instead used equipment belonging to the Armed Forces of the Philippines.

Upon arrival in the Philippines, the cast was sent on an intensive training course, during which they had to dig foxholes and were subjected to forced marches and nighttime &quot;ambushes,&quot; which used special-effects explosions. Led by Vietnam War veteran Dale Dye, training put the principal actors—including Sheen, Dafoe, Depp and Whitaker—through an immersive 30-day military-style training regimen. They limited how much food and water they could drink and eat and when the actors slept, fired blanks to keep the tired actors awake. Dye also had a small role as Captain Harris. Stone said that he was trying to break them down, &quot;to mess with their heads so we could get that dog-tired, don&#x27;t give a damn attitude, the anger, the irritation ... the casual approach to death&quot;. Willem Dafoe said &quot;the training was very important to the making of the film&quot;, adding to its authenticity and strengthening the camaraderie developed among the cast: &quot;By the time you got through the training and through the film, you had a relationship to the weapon. It wasn&#x27;t going to kill people, but you felt comfortable with it.&quot;

Scenes were shot in Mount Makiling, Laguna (for the forest scenes), Cavite (for the river and village scenes), and Villamor Air Base near Manila.

In 1986, a novelization of the film script, written by Dale Dye, was published. In 2018 actor Paul Sanchez, who played Doc in the movie, made a documentary about the making of the film, entitled &quot;Platoon: Brothers in Arms&quot;.

==Soundtrack==
The film score was composed by Georges Delerue. Music used in the film includes &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; by Samuel Barber, &quot;White Rabbit&quot; by Jefferson Airplane, and &quot;Okie from Muskogee&quot; by Merle Haggard (which is an anachronism, as the film is set in 1967 but Haggard&#x27;s song was not released until 1969). During a scene in the &quot;Underworld&quot;, the soldiers sing along to &quot;The Tracks of My Tears&quot; by Smokey Robinson and The Miracles, which was also featured in the film&#x27;s trailer. The soundtrack includes &quot;Groovin&#x27;&quot; by The Rascals and &quot;(Sittin&#x27; On) The Dock of the Bay&quot; by Otis Redding.

==Release==

&quot;Platoon&quot; was released in the United States on December 19, 1986, and in the Philippines and the United Kingdom in March 1987, with its release in the latter receiving an above 15 rating for strong language, scenes of violence, and soft drug use.

In its seventh weekend of release, the film expanded from 214 theatres to 590 and became number one at the United States box office with a gross of $8,352,394. It remained number one for four weekends. In its ninth weekend, it grossed $12.9 million from 1,194 theatres over the four-day President&#x27;s Day weekend, being the first film to gross more than $10 million in a weekend in February and setting a weekend record for Orion.

===Home media===
Due to a legal dispute between HBO Home Video and Vestron Video over home video rights, the film was delayed from its planned October 1987 release. After a settlement was reached, it was finally released on tape on January 22, 1988, through HBO, and then reissued on September 1, 1988, by Vestron. Vestron reissued the film twice, in 1991 and 1994. It made its DVD debut in 1997 through Live Entertainment. It was released again on VHS in 1999 by PolyGram Video (who briefly held the rights to the film through its purchase of the Epic library). The film was rereleased on DVD and again on VHS in 2001 by MGM Home Entertainment (who now owns the rights to the film through their purchase of the pre-1996 PolyGram Filmed Entertainment library). MGM released the 20th anniversary DVD through Sony Pictures Home Entertainment in 2006 while 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the Blu-ray version on May 25, 2011. Shout! Factory released the 4K remastered Blu-Ray on September 18, 2018, and released a 4K Ultra-HD/Blu-ray combo pack on September 13, 2022.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Platoon&quot; has an approval rating of 89% based on 123 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Informed by director Oliver Stone&#x27;s personal experiences in Vietnam, &quot;Platoon&quot; forgoes easy sermonizing in favor of a harrowing, ground-level view of war, bolstered by no-holds-barred performances from Charlie Sheen and Willem Dafoe.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 92 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave it four out of four stars, calling it the best film of the year, and the ninth best of the 1980s. Gene Siskel also awarded the film four out of four stars, and observed that Vietnam War veterans greatly identified with the film. In his &quot;New York Times&quot; review, Vincent Canby described &quot;Platoon&quot; as &quot;possibly the best work of any kind about the Vietnam War since Michael Herr&#x27;s vigorous and hallucinatory book &quot;Dispatches&quot;.

&quot;The film has been widely acclaimed,&quot; Pauline Kael admitted, &quot;but some may feel that Stone takes too many melodramatic shortcuts, and that there&#x27;s too much filtered light, too much poetic license, and too damn much romanticized insanity ... The movie crowds you; it doesn&#x27;t leave you room for an honest emotion.&quot;

However, black journalist Wallace Terry, who spent a two-year tour in Vietnam, and wrote the 1967 &quot;Time&quot; cover story titled &quot;The Negro in Vietnam&quot;, criticized the film for its depiction of African-American soldiers in Vietnam. In an interview with Maria Wilhelm of &quot;People&quot;, he called the film&#x27;s depiction of black troops &quot;a slap in the face&quot;. In the interview, Terry noted that there were no black actors playing officers, and the three notable black soldiers in the film were all portrayed as cowards. He further went on to criticise the film for perpetuating black stereotypes, stating the film &quot;barely rises above the age-old Hollywood stereotypes of blacks as celluloid savages and coons who do silly things&quot;. African-American veteran Bennie J. Swans described the black characters as &quot;unable to lead and unable to follow&quot;, and said that &quot;Millions of people are going to accept this movie as an accurate picture of blacks in the war... It re-enforces old, untrue stereotypes. That makes this a dangerous movie.&quot;

Some Vietnam war veterans claimed the film perpetuated &quot;cliché&#x27;s&quot; of American soldiers as &quot;baby killers&quot; and &quot;dope addicts&quot; and denying the use of drugs and military officers as &quot;psychos or cowards&quot;, while others praised Stone for &quot;telling it the way it is&quot; regarding the depiction of the war. Some veterans accused Stone of covering up war crimes he had himself witnessed as a soldier by failing to report them to his superiors, given the film was based on his autobiographical experiences.

The film stars William Hurt, Marlee Matlin (in her film debut), Piper Laurie, and Philip Bosco. The film&#x27;s narrative follows two employees at a school for the deaf: a Deaf custodian and a hearing speech teacher, whose conflicting ideologies on speech and deafness create tension and discord in their developing romantic relationship.

&quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot; premiered at the 37th Berlin International Film Festival, where it competed for the Golden Bear, while Haines received a Special Silver Bear. It was theatrically released on October 3, 1986, by Paramount Pictures to critical and commercial success. Reviewers praised Haines&#x27;s direction, the screenplay, and particularly the performances of Hurt, Matlin, and Laurie. The film grossed $101.5 million worldwide on a $10.5 million budget. It received five nominations at the 59th Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor (for Hurt), Best Supporting Actress (for Laurie), Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Actress (for Matlin). At age 21, Matlin became the youngest Best Actress winner as well as the first deaf winner in Oscar history.

== Plot ==
An energetic new teacher, James Leeds, arrives at a school for the deaf and hard of hearing in New England. He soon sees a young deaf woman, Sarah Norman, working as a janitor. Sarah, a former top student, is not well regarded by the hearing staff, but seems to integrate well with the deaf students. James begins to try to talk with her, arranging a meeting through her boss, pursuing her after school while she is attempting to clean, and persisting despite being rejected several times. She eventually agrees to go to dinner, and from the sidelines he watches her dance as she feels the music.

Sarah does not want to use her voice, and James eventually agrees not to try to force her to—a promise he later breaks. He finds out that Sarah refuses to visit her home, and assumes her mother has stopped reaching out. Through her mother, James finds out that Sarah and her sister Ruth were popular, and according to her mother her peers treated Sarah as if she was not different from other women. Unfortunately, Sarah later reveals that she was sorely used by the unnamed &quot;boys&quot;, and may have been a victim of sex abuse. Such treatment has led Sarah to mistrust men and resist interacting with anyone. Later, in a pool scene, he walks in on her swimming nude. James confesses that he is falling in love with Sarah. She seems to be afraid. He falls into the pool on purpose, which changes the mood of the interaction. They share a passionate kiss in the water, then James undresses. It is implied that they have sex that night for the first time.

The relationship between James and Sarah develops. The school superintendent warns James that he does not believe the relationship will work, but James is adamant that he will stay with Sarah because he loves her. James choreographs a dance with his deaf students, in which they lip-sync to a song on a stage in front of their parents. Sarah sees this performance and becomes upset over the fact that the students use their voices. The conflict between James and Sarah persists as she thinks James hates her for not speaking. James convinces Sarah to leave her job and move in with him, although it is not clear what her plans for the future are. James&#x27;s determination to hear Sarah speak and his inability to help her to develop individual pursuits frustrates her, and she feels he is patronizing her. They split up shortly after.

Sarah leaves James and goes to live with her estranged mother, reconciling with her in the process. James chases her, but she refuses to see him. After inquiring about her, James learns Sarah is working as a manicurist. Eventually, she and James reconcile at the school prom. They decide to learn how to stay connected in between the worlds of silence and sound.

== Production ==
===Development===
After meeting deaf actress Phyllis Frelich in 1977 at the University of Rhode Island&#x27;s New Repertory Project, playwright Medoff wrote the play &quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot; to be her star vehicle. Based partially on Frelich&#x27;s relationship with her hearing husband Robert Steinberg, the play chronicles the tumultuous relationship and marriage between a reluctant-to-speak deaf woman and an unconventional speech pathologist for the deaf. With Frelich starring, &quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot; opened on Broadway in 1980, received three Tony Awards, including Best Play, and ran for 887 performances before closing in 1982.

Following the vast success of his Broadway debut, Medoff, with fellow writer Anderson, penned a screenplay adapted from the original script. Though many changes were made, the core love story remained intact. The title of the film comes from the eleventh chapter (&quot;The Passing of Arthur&quot;) of Alfred Lord Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;.

===Filming===
The movie was shot primarily in and around Saint John, New Brunswick, during the autumn of 1985, with the Rothesay Netherwood School serving as the main set. Aside from locations in Saint John and Rothesay Netherwood School, sets were constructed by Saint John local Keith MacDonald.

==Release==
The adaptation premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 13, 1986, and was released widely in the United States on October 3 of the same year. Like its source material, the film generally gained praise from the hearing and deaf communities alike.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened at number five at the box office in the United States and Canada with an opening weekend gross of $1,909,084. The film stayed in the top ten for eight weeks and grossed a total of $31,853,080. Internationally it grossed $69.6 million for a worldwide total of $101.5 million.

===Critical reception===

&quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot; received generally positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot; holds an approval rating of 81% based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 7.10/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot; transcends its transparently noble goals thanks to a pair of absorbing performances from William Hurt and Marlee Matlin.&quot; Particular praise was given to the film&#x27;s two leads. Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; magazine said of Matlin, &quot;she has an unusual talent for concentrating her emotions—and an audience&#x27;s—in her signing. But there is something more here, an ironic intelligence, a fierce but not distancing wit, that the movies, with their famous ability to photograph thought, discover in very few performances.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3 out of a possible 4 stars, describing the subject matter as &quot;new and challenging&quot;, saying he was &quot;interested in everything the movie had to tell me about deafness.&quot; He continued, &quot;The performances are strong and wonderful – not only by Hurt, one of the best actors of his generation, but also by Matlin, a deaf actress who is appearing in her first movie. She holds her own against the powerhouse she&#x27;s acting with, carrying scenes with a passion and almost painful fear of being rejected and hurt, which is really what her rebellion is about.&quot; Paul Attanasio of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said of the film, &quot;This is romance the way Hollywood used to make it, with both conflict and tenderness, at times capturing the texture of the day-to-day, at times finding the lyrical moments when two lovers find that time stops.&quot; He goes on to say of Matlin, &quot;The most obvious challenge of the role is to communicate without speaking, but Matlin rises to it in the same way the stars of the silent era did – she acts with her eyes, her gestures.&quot;

The film is not subtitled (neither the spoken dialogue nor the signing); instead, as Ebert observed, the signed dialogue is repeated aloud by Hurt&#x27;s character, &quot;as if to himself&quot;.

===Awards and nominations===
The film received five Academy Award nominations, with Marlee Matlin winning for Best Actress. Marlee Matlin was 21 years old when she won, making her the youngest Best Actress winner to date and the first deaf Academy Award winner. &quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot; was the first ever female-helmed film to be nominated for Best Picture.

<doc id="113464" wikidata="Q845057" url="?curid=113464" title="Hannah and Her Sisters">
<text>Hannah and Her Sisters is a 1986 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Woody Allen. It tells the intertwined stories of an extended family over two years that begins and ends with a family Thanksgiving dinner. Allen also stars in the film, along with Mia Farrow as Hannah, Michael Caine as her husband, and Barbara Hershey and Dianne Wiest as her sisters. Alongside them, the film features Carrie Fisher, Lloyd Nolan, Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan, Max von Sydow, Daniel Stern, John Turturro, Lewis Black (debut), and Julie Kavner.

&quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; was, for a long time, Allen&#x27;s biggest box office success, with a North American gross of US$40 million. The film won Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay (for Allen), Best Supporting Actor (for Caine), and Best Supporting Actress (for Wiest). It is often considered one of Allen&#x27;s major works, with critics continuing to praise its writing and ensemble cast.

==Plot==
The story is told in three main arcs, with most of it occurring during a 24-month period beginning and ending at Thanksgiving parties, held at The Langham, hosted by Hannah, and her husband, Elliot. Hannah serves as the stalwart hub of the narrative; most of the events of the film connect to her.

Elliot becomes infatuated with one of Hannah&#x27;s sisters, Lee, and eventually begins an affair with her. Elliot attributes his behavior to his discontent with his wife&#x27;s self-sufficiency and resentment of her emotional strength. Lee has lived for five years with a reclusive artist, Frederick, who is much older. She finds her relationship with Frederick no longer intellectually or sexually stimulating, in spite of (or maybe because of) Frederick&#x27;s professed interest in continuing to teach her. She leaves Frederick after admitting to having a dalliance with Elliot. For the remainder of the year between the first and second Thanksgiving gatherings, Elliot and Lee carry on their affair despite Elliot&#x27;s inability to end his marriage to Hannah. Lee finally ends the affair during the second Thanksgiving, explaining that she is finished waiting for him to commit and that she has started dating someone else.

Hannah&#x27;s ex-husband Mickey, a television writer, is present mostly in scenes outside of the primary story. Flashbacks reveal that his marriage to Hannah fell apart after they were unable to have children because of his infertility. However, they had twins who are not biologically his, before divorcing. He also went on a disastrous date with Hannah&#x27;s sister Holly, when they were set up after the divorce. A hypochondriac, he goes to his doctor complaining of hearing loss, and is frightened by the possibility that it might be a brain tumor. When tests prove that he is perfectly healthy, he is initially overjoyed, but then despairs that his life is meaningless. His existential crisis leads to unsatisfying experiments with religious conversion to Catholicism and an interest in Krishna Consciousness. Ultimately, a suicide attempt leads him to find meaning in his life after unexpectedly viewing the Marx Brothers&#x27; &quot;Duck Soup&quot; in a movie theater. The revelation that life should be enjoyed, rather than understood, helps to prepare him for a second date with Holly, which this time blossoms into love.

Holly&#x27;s story is the film&#x27;s third main arc. A former cocaine addict, she is an unsuccessful actress who cannot settle on a career. After borrowing money from Hannah, she starts a catering business with April, a friend and fellow actress. Holly and April end up as rivals in auditions for parts in Broadway musicals, as well as for the affections of an architect, David. Holly abandons the catering business after the romance with David fails and decides to try her hand at writing. The career change forces her once again to borrow money from Hannah, a dependency that Holly resents. She writes a script inspired by Hannah and Elliot, which greatly upsets Hannah. It is suggested that much of the script involved personal details of Hannah and Elliot&#x27;s marriage that had been conveyed to Holly through Lee (having been transmitted first from Elliot). Although this threatens to expose the affair between Elliot and Lee, Elliot soon disavows disclosing any such details. Holly sets aside her script, and instead writes a story inspired by her own life, which Mickey reads and admires greatly, vowing to help her get it produced and leading to their second date.

A minor arc in the film tells part of the story of Norma and Evan. They are the parents of Hannah and her two sisters, and still have acting careers of their own. Their own tumultuous marriage revolves around Norma&#x27;s alcoholism and alleged affairs, but the long-term bond between them is evident in Evan&#x27;s flirtatious anecdotes about Norma while playing piano at the Thanksgiving gatherings.

By the time of the film&#x27;s third Thanksgiving, Lee has married a literature professor she met while taking random classes at Columbia University. Hannah and Elliot have reconciled their marriage. The film&#x27;s final shot reveals that Holly is married to Mickey and that she is pregnant.

==Cast==
(in order of appearance)

==Influences==
Part of the film&#x27;s structure and background is borrowed from Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; (1982). In both films, a large theatrical family gather for three successive years&#x27; celebrations (Thanksgiving in Allen&#x27;s film, Christmas in Bergman&#x27;s). The first of each gathering is in a time of contentment, the second in a time of trouble, and the third showing what happens after the resolution of the troubles. The sudden appearance of Mickey&#x27;s reflection behind Holly&#x27;s in the closing scene also parallels the apparition behind Alexander of the Bishop&#x27;s ghost. Additional parallels can be found with Luchino Visconti&#x27;s 1960 film &quot;Rocco and His Brothers&quot;, which, besides the connection to its name, also uses the structural device of dividing sections of the film for the different siblings&#x27; plot arcs.

==Production==
The film was originally about a man who fell in love with his wife&#x27;s sister. Woody Allen then re-read the novel &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; &quot;and I thought, it&#x27;s interesting how this guy gets the various stories going, cutting from one story to another. I loved the idea of experimenting with that.&quot;

He was particularly intrigued by the character of Nicholas Levin &quot;who can&#x27;t seem to find any meaning to life, he&#x27;s terribly afraid of dying. It struck home very deeply. I thought it would be interesting to do one story about the relationship between three sisters and one story about someone else and his obsession with mortality.&quot;

Allen admits the role of Hannah was based on Farrow being &quot;a romanticized perception of Mia. She&#x27;s very stable, she has eight children now, and she&#x27;s able to run her career and have good relationships with her sister and her mother. I&#x27;m very impressed with those qualities, and I thought if she had two unstable sisters, it would be interesting.&quot;

Allen says he was also inspired by the title. &quot;I thought I&#x27;d like to make a film called &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot;&quot;, he said, saying this prompted him to give Hannah two sisters. He was interested in making something about the relationship between sisters which he felt was more complex than that between brothers. &quot;Maybe that comes from childhood; my mother had seven sisters and their children were female so all I knew were aunts and female cousins.&quot;

Shooting began in October of 1984 in New York City, with Mia Farrow&#x27;s real-life apartment being used.

Mia Farrow later wrote that Allen had been intrigued about the subject of sisters for a long time. His earlier co-stars Janet Margolin and Diane Keaton both had two sisters each, and Farrow had three. She says Allen gave her an early copy of &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; saying she could play whatever sister she wanted, but that &quot;he felt I should be Hannah, the more complex and enigmatic of the sisters ... whose stillness and internal strength he likened to the quality Al Pacino projected in &quot;The Godfather&quot;&quot;.

Farrow wrote, &quot;It was the first time I criticized one of his scripts. To me, the characters seemed self-indulgent and dissolute in predictable ways. The script was wordy but it said nothing.&quot; She claims &quot;Woody didn&#x27;t disagree and tried to switch over to&quot; an alternative idea, &quot;but preproduction was already in progress, and we had to proceed&quot;.

She later elaborated:
It was my mother&#x27;s stunned, chill reaction to the script that enabled me to see how he had taken many of the personal circumstances and themes of our lives, and, it seemed, had distorted them into cartoonish characterizations. At the same time he was my partner. I loved him. I could trust him with my life. And he was a writer: this is what writers do. All grist for the mill. Relatives have always grumbled. He had taken the ordinary stuff of our lives and lifted it into art. We were honored and outraged.

Farrow admitted &quot;a small sick feeling ... deep inside me&quot; which &quot;I shared with nobody was my fear that &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; had openly and clearly spelled out his feelings for my sister. But this was fiction, I told myself ... So I put those thoughts out of my mind.&quot;

==Release==
The film premiered at the US Film Festival in Utah on January 25, 1986.

The film was screened out of competition at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival.

===Box office===
&quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; opened on February 7, 1986, in 54 theaters, where it grossed $1,265,826 ($23,441 per screen) in its opening weekend, the first time an Allen film had debuted in theaters in cities other than New York City. When it expanded to 761 theaters on March 14, it garnered a respectable $2,707,966 ($3,809 per screen). It went on to gross $40,084,041 in the United States and Canada (including a re-release the following year), and remains one of the highest-grossing Woody Allen films. Adjusted for inflation it falls behind &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (1977) and &quot;Manhattan&quot; (1979), and possibly also one or two of his early comedies. &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot; (2011) surpassed its box office as well.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on 56 reviews, with an average rating of 8.40/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Smart, tender, and funny in equal measure, &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; is one of Woody Allen&#x27;s finest films.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 90 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. The film received seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture. Allen received two Academy Award nominations, winning one for Best Screenplay, Original and he earned a nomination for Best Director. His work on the film was also recognized with two BAFTA Awards.

Critics Siskel and Ebert each rated the film among the top three of the 1986 film year; Roger Ebert&#x27;s 1986 review of the film called it &quot;the best movie [Woody Allen] has ever made&quot;. Three years later when the two critics discussed their lists of the 10 best films of the 1980s, Ebert, who had included no comedies on his list, stated that had he been required to include one, it would have been &quot;Hannah And Her Sisters&quot;.

Vincent Canby, of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, gave the film a highly favorable review, going as far as to say that it &quot;sets new standards for Mr. Allen as well as for all American movie makers&quot;.

A poll of 100 film critics named &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; the best film of the year, after it appeared on 71 individual top ten lists.

In 2005, the Writers Guild of America, West named Allen&#x27;s script the 95th best film screenplay ever written.

In October 2013, the film was voted by readers of &quot;The Guardian&quot; as the fourth best film directed by Woody Allen.

In 2014, Calum Marsh of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; named &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; as Allen&#x27;s greatest film, praising its ensemble cast and Allen&#x27;s &quot;dense, heady script&quot; for its &quot;balancing act of conflicting desires and feelings&quot;. It was also listed as Allen&#x27;s finest work in a joint article by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; film critics Robbie Collin and Tim Robey, who compared its structure with the works of Anton Chekhov and lauded it as &quot;perhaps the most perfectly assured braiding of comedy and drama in mainstream American film. It feels like the miraculous sweet spot between all of its filmmaker&#x27;s many modes and tones – biting without being cruel, profound without seeming sanctimonious, warmly humane without collapsing into goo.&quot; It was ranked third among Allen&#x27;s films in a 2016 poll of &quot;Time Out&quot; contributors, with editor Joshua Rothkopf singling out the character of Holly as &quot;the kind of desperate, flailing Manhattanite that future director-writers would spin entire careers out of&quot;.

===Accolades===
Michael Caine and Dianne Wiest won Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress for their portrayals of Elliot and Holly, respectively. &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; was the last film to win in both supporting acting categories until &quot;The Fighter&quot; in 2011. The film was also nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Film Editing.

Allen received the 1986 award for Best Director from the U.S. National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, Dianne Wiest won Best Supporting Actress, and the film was nominated for Best Film.

In France, the film was nominated for a César Award for Best Foreign Film.

==Legacy==
In 1986, &quot;Mad&quot; magazine satirized the film as &quot;Henna and Her Sickos&quot; which was written by Debbee Ovitz with art by Mort Drucker.

In 2016, Olivia Wilde directed a live table reading of &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; at &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ small and packed-out Times Center theatre. The cast included, Wilde as Hannah, Rose Byrne as Lee, Uma Thurman as Holly, Michael Sheen as Elliott, Bobby Cannavale as Mickey, and Salman Rushdie as Frederick with Maya Rudolph, Jason Sudeikis and Justin Long filling out the supporting parts. Questlove served as the musical director who cued the musical selections ranging from jazz renditions of the Great American Songbook to Bach.

<text>In thermodynamics, the Joule–Thomson effect (also known as the Joule–Kelvin effect or Kelvin–Joule effect) describes the temperature change of a &quot;real&quot; gas or liquid (as differentiated from an ideal gas) when it is expanding; typically caused by the pressure loss from flow through a valve or porous plug while keeping it insulated so that no heat is exchanged with the environment. This procedure is called a &quot;throttling process&quot; or &quot;Joule–Thomson process&quot;. The effect is purely an effect due to deviation from ideality, as any ideal gas has no JT effect.

At room temperature, all gases except hydrogen, helium, and neon cool upon expansion by the Joule–Thomson process when being throttled through an orifice; these three gases rise in temperature when forced through a porous plug at room temperature, but lowers in temperature when already at lower temperatures. Most liquids such as hydraulic oils will be warmed by the Joule–Thomson throttling process. The temperature at which the JT effect switches sign is the inversion temperature.

The gas-cooling throttling process is commonly exploited in refrigeration processes such as liquefiers in air separation industrial process. In hydraulics, the warming effect from Joule–Thomson throttling can be used to find internally leaking valves as these will produce heat which can be detected by thermocouple or thermal-imaging camera. Throttling is a fundamentally irreversible process. The throttling due to the flow resistance in supply lines, heat exchangers, regenerators, and other components of (thermal) machines is a source of losses that limits their performance.

Since it is a constant-enthalpy process, it can be used to experimentally measure the lines of constant enthalpy (isenthalps) on the formula_1 diagram of a gas. Combined with the specific heat capacity &quot;at constant pressure&quot; formula_2 it allows the complete measurement of the thermodynamic potential for the gas.

==History==
The effect is named after James Prescott Joule and William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, who discovered it in 1852. It followed upon earlier work by Joule on Joule expansion, in which a gas undergoes free expansion in a vacuum and the temperature is unchanged, if the gas is ideal.

==Description==
The &quot;adiabatic&quot; (no heat exchanged) expansion of a gas may be carried out in a number of ways. The change in temperature experienced by the gas during expansion depends not only on the initial and final pressure, but also on the manner in which the expansion is carried out.

*If the expansion process is reversible, meaning that the gas is in thermodynamic equilibrium at all times, it is called an &quot;isentropic&quot; expansion. In this scenario, the gas does positive work during the expansion, and its temperature decreases.
*In a free expansion, on the other hand, the gas does no work and absorbs no heat, so the internal energy is conserved. Expanded in this manner, the temperature of an ideal gas would remain constant, but the temperature of a real gas decreases, except at very high temperature.
*The method of expansion discussed in this article, in which a gas or liquid at pressure &quot;P&quot;1 flows into a region of lower pressure &quot;P&quot;2 without significant change in kinetic energy, is called the Joule–Thomson expansion. The expansion is inherently irreversible. During this expansion, enthalpy remains unchanged (see proof below). Unlike a free expansion, work is done, causing a change in internal energy. Whether the internal energy increases or decreases is determined by whether work is done on or by the fluid; that is determined by the initial and final states of the expansion and the properties of the fluid.
The temperature change produced during a Joule–Thomson expansion is quantified by the Joule–Thomson coefficient, formula_3. This coefficient may be either positive (corresponding to cooling) or negative (heating); the regions where each occurs for molecular nitrogen, N2, are shown in the figure. Note that most conditions in the figure correspond to N2 being a supercritical fluid, where it has some properties of a gas and some of a liquid, but can not be really described as being either. The coefficient is negative at both very high and very low temperatures; at very high pressure it is negative at all temperatures. The maximum inversion temperature (621 K for N2) occurs as zero pressure is approached. For N2 gas at low pressures, formula_3 is negative at high temperatures and positive at low temperatures. At temperatures below the gas-liquid coexistence curve, N2 condenses to form a liquid and the coefficient again becomes negative. Thus, for N2 gas below 621 K, a Joule–Thomson expansion can be used to cool the gas until liquid N2 forms.

==Physical mechanism==

There are two factors that can change the temperature of a fluid during an adiabatic expansion: a change in internal energy or the conversion between potential and kinetic internal energy. Temperature is the measure of thermal kinetic energy (energy associated with molecular motion); so a change in temperature indicates a change in thermal kinetic energy. The internal energy is the sum of thermal kinetic energy and thermal potential energy. Thus, even if the internal energy does not change, the temperature can change due to conversion between kinetic and potential energy; this is what happens in a free expansion and typically produces a decrease in temperature as the fluid expands. If work is done on or by the fluid as it expands, then the total internal energy changes. This is what happens in a Joule–Thomson expansion and can produce larger heating or cooling than observed in a free expansion.

In a Joule–Thomson expansion the enthalpy remains constant. The enthalpy, formula_5, is defined as
:formula_6
where formula_7 is internal energy, formula_8 is pressure, and formula_9 is volume. Under the conditions of a Joule–Thomson expansion, the change in formula_10 represents the work done by the fluid (see the proof below). If formula_10 increases, with formula_5 constant, then formula_7 must decrease as a result of the fluid doing work on its surroundings. This produces a decrease in temperature and results in a positive Joule–Thomson coefficient. Conversely, a decrease in formula_10 means that work is done on the fluid and the internal energy increases. If the increase in kinetic energy exceeds the increase in potential energy, there will be an increase in the temperature of the fluid and the Joule–Thomson coefficient will be negative.

For an ideal gas, formula_10 does not change during a Joule–Thomson expansion. As a result, there is no change in internal energy; since there is also no change in thermal potential energy, there can be no change in thermal kinetic energy and, therefore, no change in temperature. In real gases, formula_10 does change.

The ratio of the value of formula_10 to that expected for an ideal gas at the same temperature is called the compressibility factor, formula_18. For a gas, this is typically less than unity at low temperature and greater than unity at high temperature (see the discussion in compressibility factor). At low pressure, the value of formula_18 always moves towards unity as a gas expands. Thus at low temperature, formula_18 and formula_10 will increase as the gas expands, resulting in a positive Joule–Thomson coefficient. At high temperature, formula_18 and formula_10 decrease as the gas expands; if the decrease is large enough, the Joule–Thomson coefficient will be negative.

For liquids, and for supercritical fluids under high pressure, formula_10 increases as pressure increases. This is due to molecules being forced together, so that the volume can barely decrease due to higher pressure. Under such conditions, the Joule–Thomson coefficient is negative, as seen in the figure above.

The physical mechanism associated with the Joule–Thomson effect is closely related to that of a shock wave, although a shock wave differs in that the change in bulk kinetic energy of the gas flow is not negligible.

==The Joule–Thomson (Kelvin) coefficient==
The rate of change of temperature formula_25 with respect to pressure formula_8 in a Joule–Thomson process (that is, at constant enthalpy formula_5) is the &quot;Joule–Thomson (Kelvin) coefficient&quot; formula_3. This coefficient can be expressed in terms of the gas&#x27;s specific volume formula_9, its heat capacity at constant pressure formula_30, and its coefficient of thermal expansion formula_31 as:
:formula_32

See the below for the proof of this relation. The value of formula_3 is typically expressed in °C/bar (SI units: K/Pa) and depends on the type of gas and on the temperature and pressure of the gas before expansion. Its pressure dependence is usually only a few percent for pressures up to 100 bar.

All real gases have an &quot;inversion point&quot; at which the value of formula_3 changes sign. The temperature of this point, the &quot;Joule–Thomson inversion temperature&quot;, depends on the pressure of the gas before expansion.

In a gas expansion the pressure decreases, so the sign of formula_35 is negative by definition. With that in mind, the following table explains when the Joule–Thomson effect cools or warms a real gas:

Helium and hydrogen are two gases whose Joule–Thomson inversion temperatures at a pressure of one atmosphere are very low (e.g., about 40 K, −233 °C for helium). Thus, helium and hydrogen warm when expanded at constant enthalpy at typical room temperatures. On the other hand, nitrogen and oxygen, the two most abundant gases in air, have inversion temperatures of 621 K (348 °C) and 764 K (491 °C) respectively: these gases can be cooled from room temperature by the Joule–Thomson effect.

For an ideal gas, formula_36 is always equal to zero: ideal gases neither warm nor cool upon being expanded at constant enthalpy.

For a Van der Waals gas, the coefficient isformula_37with inversion temperature formula_38.
For the Dieterici gas, the reduced inversion temperature is formula_39, and the relation between reduced pressure and reduced inversion temperature is formula_40. This is plotted on the right. The critical point falls inside the region where the gas cools on expansion. The outside region is where the gas warms on expansion.

==Applications==

In practice, the Joule–Thomson effect is achieved by allowing the gas to expand through a throttling device (usually a valve) which must be very well insulated to prevent any heat transfer to or from the gas. No external work is extracted from the gas during the expansion (the gas must not be expanded through a turbine, for example).

The cooling produced in the Joule–Thomson expansion makes it a valuable tool in refrigeration. The effect is applied in the Linde technique as a standard process in the petrochemical industry, where the cooling effect is used to liquefy gases, and in many cryogenic applications (e.g. for the production of liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon). A gas must be below its inversion temperature to be liquefied by the Linde cycle. For this reason, simple Linde cycle liquefiers, starting from ambient temperature, cannot be used to liquefy helium, hydrogen, or neon. They must first be cooled to their inversion temperatures, which are -233 C (helium), -71 C (hydrogen), and -42 C (neon).

==Proof that the specific enthalpy remains constant==

In thermodynamics so-called &quot;specific&quot; quantities are quantities per unit mass (kg) and are denoted by lower-case characters. So &quot;h&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, and &quot;v&quot; are the specific enthalpy, specific internal energy, and specific volume (volume per unit mass, or reciprocal density), respectively. In a Joule–Thomson process the specific enthalpy &quot;h&quot; remains constant. To prove this, the first step is to compute the net work done when a mass &quot;m&quot; of the gas moves through the plug. This amount of gas has a volume of &quot;V&quot;1 = &quot;m&quot; &quot;v&quot;1 in the region at pressure &quot;P&quot;1 (region 1) and a volume &quot;V&quot;2 = &quot;m&quot; &quot;v&quot;2 when in the region at pressure &quot;P&quot;2 (region 2). Then in region 1, the &quot;flow work&quot; done &quot;on&quot; the amount of gas by the rest of the gas is: W1 = &quot;m&quot; &quot;P&quot;1&quot;v&quot;1. In region 2, the work done &quot;by&quot; the amount of gas on the rest of the gas is: W2 = &quot;m&quot; &quot;P&quot;2&quot;v&quot;2. So, the total work done &quot;on&quot; the mass &quot;m&quot; of gas is
:formula_41

The change in internal energy minus the total work done &quot;on&quot; the amount of gas is, by the first law of thermodynamics, the total heat supplied to the amount of gas.
:formula_42

In the Joule–Thomson process, the gas is insulated, so no heat is absorbed. This means that
:formula_43

where &quot;u&quot;1 and &quot;u&quot;2 denote the specific internal energies of the gas in regions 1 and 2, respectively. Using the definition of the specific enthalpy &quot;h = u + Pv&quot;, the above equation implies that
:formula_44

where h1 and &quot;h&quot;2 denote the specific enthalpies of the amount of gas in regions 1 and 2, respectively.

==Throttling in the &quot;T&quot;-&quot;s&quot; diagram==
A convenient way to get a quantitative understanding of the throttling process is by using diagrams such as &quot;h&quot;-&quot;T&quot; diagrams, &quot;h&quot;-&quot;P&quot; diagrams, and others. Commonly used are the so-called &quot;T&quot;-&quot;s&quot; diagrams. Figure 2 shows the &quot;T&quot;-&quot;s&quot; diagram of nitrogen as an example. Various points are indicated as follows:

As shown before, throttling keeps &quot;h&quot; constant. E.g. throttling from 200 bar and 300K (point a in fig. 2) follows the isenthalpic (line of constant specific enthalpy) of 430kJ/kg. At 1 bar it results in point b which has a temperature of 270K. So throttling from 200 bar to 1 bar gives a cooling from room temperature to below the freezing point of water. Throttling from 200 bar and an initial temperature of 133K (point c in fig. 2) to 1 bar results in point d, which is in the two-phase region of nitrogen at a temperature of 77.2K. Since the enthalpy is an extensive parameter the enthalpy in d (&quot;h&quot;d) is equal to the enthalpy in e (&quot;h&quot;e) multiplied with the mass fraction of the liquid in d (&quot;x&quot;d) plus the enthalpy in f (&quot;h&quot;f) multiplied with the mass fraction of the gas in d (1 − &quot;x&quot;d). So
:formula_45

With numbers: 150 = &quot;x&quot;d 28 + (1 − &quot;x&quot;d) 230 so &quot;x&quot;d is about 0.40. This means that the mass fraction of the liquid in the liquid–gas mixture leaving the throttling valve is 40%.

==Derivation of the Joule–Thomson coefficient==

It is difficult to think physically about what the Joule–Thomson coefficient, formula_3, represents. Also, modern determinations of formula_3 do not use the original method used by Joule and Thomson, but instead measure a different, closely related quantity. Thus, it is useful to derive relationships between formula_3 and other, more conveniently measured quantities, as described below.

The first step in obtaining these results is to note that the Joule–Thomson coefficient involves the three variables &quot;T&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, and &quot;H&quot;. A useful result is immediately obtained by applying the cyclic rule; in terms of these three variables that rule may be written
:formula_49

Each of the three partial derivatives in this expression has a specific meaning. The first is formula_3, the second is the constant pressure heat capacity, formula_30, defined by
:formula_52

and the third is the inverse of the &quot;isothermal Joule–Thomson coefficient&quot;, formula_53, defined by
:formula_54.
This last quantity is more easily measured than formula_3 . Thus, the expression from the cyclic rule becomes
:formula_56

This equation can be used to obtain Joule–Thomson coefficients from the more easily measured isothermal Joule–Thomson coefficient. It is used in the following to obtain a mathematical expression for the Joule–Thomson coefficient in terms of the volumetric properties of a fluid.

To proceed further, the starting point is the fundamental equation of thermodynamics in terms of enthalpy; this is
:formula_57

Now &quot;dividing through&quot; by d&quot;P&quot;, while holding temperature constant, yields
:formula_58
The partial derivative on the left is the isothermal Joule–Thomson coefficient, formula_53, and the one on the right can be expressed in terms of the coefficient of thermal expansion via a Maxwell relation. The appropriate relation is
:formula_60
where &quot;α&quot; is the cubic coefficient of thermal expansion. Replacing these two partial derivatives yields
:formula_61

This expression can now replace formula_53 in the earlier equation for formula_3 to obtain:
:formula_64

This provides an expression for the Joule–Thomson coefficient in terms of the commonly available properties heat capacity, molar volume, and thermal expansion coefficient. It shows that the Joule–Thomson inversion temperature, at which formula_3 is zero, occurs when the coefficient of thermal expansion is equal to the inverse of the temperature. Since this is true at all temperatures for ideal gases (see expansion in gases), the Joule–Thomson coefficient of an ideal gas is zero at all temperatures.

==Joule&#x27;s second law==

It is easy to verify that for an ideal gas defined by suitable microscopic postulates that &quot;αT&quot; = 1, so the temperature change of such an ideal gas at a Joule–Thomson expansion is zero.
For such an ideal gas, this theoretical result implies that:
:&quot;The internal energy of a fixed mass of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature (not pressure or volume).&quot;

This rule was originally found by Joule experimentally for real gases and is known as Joule&#x27;s second law. More refined experiments found important deviations from it.

<text>A Room with a View is a 1908 novel by English writer E. M. Forster, about a young woman in the restrained culture of Edwardian-era England. Set in Italy and England, the story is both a romance and a humorous critique of English society at the beginning of the 20th century. Merchant Ivory produced an award-winning film adaptation in 1985.

The Modern Library ranked &quot;A Room with a View&quot; 79th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century (1998).

==Plot summary==

===Part one===

The novel is set in the early 1900s as upper-middle-class English women are beginning to lead more independent, adventurous lives. In the first part Miss Lucy Honeychurch is touring Italy with her overly fussy spinster cousin and chaperone, Miss Charlotte Bartlett. The novel opens in Florence with the women complaining about their rooms at the Pensione Bertolini. They were promised rooms with a view of the River Arno but instead have ones overlooking a drab courtyard. Another guest, Mr. Emerson, interrupts their &quot;peevish wrangling&quot; by spontaneously offering to swap rooms. He and his son, George, both have rooms with views of the Arno and he argues, &quot;Women like looking at a view; men don’t.&quot; Charlotte rejects the offer, partly because she looks down on the Emersons&#x27; unconventional behaviour and because she fears it would place them under an &quot;unseemly obligation&quot;. However another guest, Mr. Beebe, an Anglican clergyman, persuades Charlotte to accept the offer; Charlotte suggests that the Emersons are socialists.

The following day Lucy spends a &quot;long morning&quot; in the Basilica of Santa Croce, accompanied by Miss Eleanor Lavish, a novelist who promises to lead her on an adventure. Lavish confiscates Lucy&#x27;s Baedeker guidebook, proclaiming she will show Lucy the &quot;true Italy&quot;. On the way to Santa Croce the two take a wrong turn and get lost. After drifting for hours through various streets and piazzas they eventually make it to the square in front of the church, only for Lavish (who still has Lucy&#x27;s Baedeker) to abandon the younger woman to pursue an old acquaintance.

Inside the church Lucy runs into the Emersons. Although the other visitors find Mr. Emerson&#x27;s behaviour somewhat unrefined, Lucy discovers she likes them both; she repeatedly encounters them in Florence. While touring Piazza della Signoria Lucy and George Emerson separately witness a murder. Overcome by its gruesomeness Lucy faints and is aided by George. Recovered, she asks him to retrieve the photographs she dropped near the murder scene. George finds them but as they are covered in blood he throws them into the river before telling Lucy; Lucy observes how boyish George is. As they stop by the River Arno before returning to the pensione they engage in a personal conversation.

Lucy decides to avoid George, partly because she is confused by her feelings and also to placate Charlotte, who grows wary of the eccentric Emersons. She overheard Mr. Eager, a clergyman, saying that Mr. Emerson, &quot;murdered his wife in the sight of God&quot;.

Later in the week Mr. Beebe, Mr. Eager, the Emersons, Miss Lavish, Charlotte and Lucy go on a day trip to Fiesole, a scenic area above Florence, driven in two carriages by Italian drivers. One driver is permitted to have a pretty girl he claims is his sister sitting next to him on the box seat. When he kisses her Mr. Eager promptly orders her to leave. In the other carriage Mr. Emerson remarks how it is defeat rather than victory to part two people in love.

On a hillside Lucy abandons Miss Lavish and Miss Bartlett to their gossip and goes searching for Mr Beebe. Misunderstanding Lucy&#x27;s awkward Italian, the driver leads her to where George is admiring the view. Overcome by Lucy&#x27;s beauty amongst a field of violets, he takes her in his arms and kisses her. However they are interrupted by Charlotte, who is shocked and upset but mostly is ruffled by her own failure as a chaperone. Lucy promises Charlotte that she will say nothing to her mother about the &quot;insult&quot; George has paid her. The two women leave for Rome the next day before Lucy can say goodbye to George.

===Part two===
In Rome Lucy spends time with Cecil Vyse, whom she knew in England. Cecil twice proposes to Lucy in Italy; she rejects him both times. As Part Two begins, Lucy has returned to Surrey, England, to her family home, Windy Corner. Cecil proposes yet again and this time she accepts. Cecil is a sophisticated London aesthete whose rank and class make him a desirable match despite his despising country society; he is a rather comic figure, who is snobbish and gives himself pretentious airs.

The vicar, Mr. Beebe, announces that a local villa has been leased; the new tenants are the Emersons, who, after a chance meeting with Cecil in London, learned about the villa being available. Cecil enticed them to come to the village as a comeuppance to the villa&#x27;s landlord, Sir Harry Otway, whom Cecil (who believes himself to be very democratic) thinks is a snob. Lucy is angry with Cecil, as she had tentatively arranged for the elderly Misses Alan, who had also been guests at the Pensione Bertolini, to rent the villa.

Fate takes an ironic turn as Mr. Beebe introduces Lucy&#x27;s brother, Freddy, to the Emersons. Freddy invites George for &quot;a bathe&quot; in a nearby pond in the woods. Freddy, George and Mr. Beebe go there. Freddy and George undress and jump in, eventually persuading Mr. Beebe to join them. The men enjoy themselves, frolicking and splashing in and out of the pond and running through the bushes until Lucy, her mother and Cecil, having taken a short-cut through the woods during their walk, come upon them.

Freddy later invites George to play tennis at Windy Corner. Although Lucy is initially mortified by facing both George and Cecil she resolves to be gracious. Cecil annoys everyone by pacing around and reading aloud from a light romance novel that contains a scene suspiciously reminiscent of George&#x27;s kissing Lucy in Fiesole. George catches Lucy alone in the garden and kisses her again. Lucy realizes that the novel was written by Miss Lavish (the writer-acquaintance from Florence) and that Charlotte must thus have told her about the kiss.

Furious with Charlotte for betraying her secret, Lucy forces her cousin to watch as she orders George to leave Windy Corner and never return. George argues that Cecil sees Lucy only as an &quot;object for the shelf&quot; and will never love her enough to grant her independence, whereas he loves her for who she is. Lucy is moved but remains firm. Later that evening, after Cecil again rudely declines to play tennis, Lucy sees Cecil for what he truly is and ends their engagement. She decides to flee to Greece with the two Misses Alan.

Meanwhile, George, unable to bear being around Lucy, is moving his father back to London, unaware Lucy has broken off her engagement. Shortly before Lucy&#x27;s departure she accidentally encounters Mr. Emerson at Mr. Beebe&#x27;s house. He is unaware that Lucy is no longer engaged and Lucy is unable to lie to him. 
With open, honest talk Mr. Emerson strips away her defenses, forcing her to admit she has been in love with George all along. He also mentions how his wife had &quot;gone under&quot;—lost the will to live—because she feared that George&#x27;s contracting typhoid at the age of 12 was a punishment for his not being baptized. Her fear was the result of a visit by the stern clergyman Mr. Eager, and the incident explains Eager&#x27;s later claim that Mr. Emerson had &quot;murdered his wife in the sight of God&quot;.

The novel ends in Florence, where George and Lucy have eloped without Mrs. Honeychurch&#x27;s consent. However Lucy has learned that Charlotte knew that Mr. Emerson was at Mr. Beebe&#x27;s that fateful day and had not discouraged nor prevented her from going in and encountering him. Although Lucy &quot;had alienated Windy Corner, perhaps for ever&quot; (although the appendix implies a reconciliation with her family), the story ends with the promise of lifelong love for both her and George.

===Appendix===
In some editions an appendix to the novel is given entitled &quot;A View without a Room&quot;, written by Forster in 1958 relating what occurred between Lucy and George after the events of the novel. It is Forster&#x27;s afterthought to the novel, and he quite clearly states that &quot;I cannot think where George and Lucy live.&quot; They were quite comfortable until the end of the First World War, with Charlotte Bartlett leaving them all her money in her will, but the war ruined their happiness according to Forster. George became a conscientious objector and lost his government job. He was given non-combatant duties to avoid prison. This left Mrs. Honeychurch deeply upset with her son-in-law. Mr. Emerson died during the war, shortly after having a confrontation with police over Lucy&#x27;s playing the music of a German composer, Beethoven, on the piano. Eventually the couple had three children, two girls and a boy, and moved to Carshalton from Highgate to find a home. Despite their wanting to move into Windy Corner after Mrs. Honeychurch&#x27;s death, Freddy sold the house to support his family, as he was &quot;an unsuccessful but prolific doctor&quot;.

Immediately after the outbreak of the Second World War George enlisted, seeing the need to stop Hitler and the Nazi regime. He was unfaithful to Lucy during his time at war. Lucy was left homeless when her flat in Watford was bombed and the same happened to her married daughter in Nuneaton. George rose to the rank of corporal but was taken prisoner by the Italians in Africa. Once the fascist government in Italy had fallen George returned to Florence. Finding it &quot;in a mess&quot;, he was unable to find the Pensione Bertolini, stating &quot;the View was still there&quot; and that &quot;the room must be there, too, but could not be found.&quot; Forster ends by stating that George and Lucy await the Third World War, but with no word on where they live, for even he does not know.

He adds that Cecil served in &quot;Information or whatever the withholding of information was then entitled&quot; during the war and was able to trick an Alexandria hostess into playing Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot; by claiming he was Belgian, not German.

==Allusions to other works==

* Mr. Beebe recalls his first encounter with Lucy was hearing her play the first of the two movements of Beethoven&#x27;s final piano sonata, Opus 111, at a talent show in Tunbridge Wells.
* While visiting the Emersons Mr. Beebe contemplates the numerous books strewn around.
:&quot;I fancy they know how to read – a rare accomplishment. What have they got? Byron. Exactly. &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;. Never heard of it. &quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot;. Never heard of it. Gibbon. Hullo! Dear George reads German. Um – um – Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and so we go on. Well, I suppose your generation knows its own business, Honeychurch.&quot; 
* At the end of chapter two, old Mr. Emerson quotes A. E. Housman&#x27;s &#x27;From far, from eve and morning&#x27;, from &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;.
* In chapter five, after bemoaning the fact that people do not appreciate landscape paintings any more, Mr. Eager misquotes William Wordsworth&#x27;s poem title &#x27;The World Is Too Much With Us&#x27;, saying &quot;The world is too much for us.&quot;
* Towards the beginning of Part Two, Cecil quotes a few unidentified stanzas (&quot;Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height&quot;, etc.). They are from Tennyson&#x27;s narrative poem &quot;The Princess&quot;.
* In the Emersons&#x27; home, the wardrobe has &quot;Mistrust all enterprises that require new clothes&quot; (a quote from Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s &quot;Walden&quot;) painted upon it.
* Cecil announces his engagement to Lucy with the words: &quot;I promessi sposi&quot; (&quot;the betrothed&quot;) – a reference either to the 1856 Ponchielli opera of that name or the Manzoni novel on which it is based.
* When George is lying on the grass in Part Two Lucy asks him about the view and he replies, &quot;My father says the only perfect view is the sky over our heads&quot;, prompting Cecil to make a throwaway comment about the works of Dante.
* Late in the novel Lucy sings a song from Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Bride of Lammermoor&quot;, finishing with the lines &#x27;Vacant heart, and hand, and eye,-/Easy live and quiet die&#x27;. Forster also incorporated Donizetti&#x27;s operatic adaptation of Scott&#x27;s novel, &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, into the concert scene of his first published novel, &quot;Where Angels Fear to Tread&quot;. Like &quot;A Room with a View&quot;, &quot;The Bride of Lammermoor&quot; is centered on a talented but restrained young woman encouraged into an engagement not of her choosing.

==Writing==
&quot;A Room with a View&quot; had a lengthy gestation. By late 1902 Forster was working on a novel set in Italy which he called the &#x27;Lucy novel&#x27;. In 1903 and 1904 he pushed it aside to work on other projects. He was still revising it in 1908.

<doc id="113471" wikidata="Q312098" url="?curid=113471" title="José Ferrer">
<text>José Vicente Ferrer de Otero y Cintrón (January 8, 1912 – January 26, 1992) was a Puerto Rican actor and director of stage, film and television. He was one of the most celebrated and esteemed Hispanic American actors—or, indeed, actors of any ethnicity—during his lifetime and after, with a career spanning nearly 60 years between 1935 and 1992. He achieved prominence for his portrayal of Cyrano de Bergerac in the play of the same name, which earned him the inaugural Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play in 1947. He reprised the role in a 1950 film version and won an Academy Award for Best Actor, making him both the first Hispanic and the first Puerto Rican–born actor to win an Academy Award.

His other notable film roles include Charles VII in &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1948), Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec in &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; (1952), defense attorney Barney Greenwald in &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; (1954), Alfred Dreyfus in &quot;I Accuse!&quot; (1958), which he also directed; the Turkish Bey in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962), Siegfried Rieber in &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; (1965), and Emperor Shaddam IV in &quot;Dune&quot; (1984). Ferrer also maintained a prolific acting and directing career on Broadway, winning a second Best Actor Tony for &quot;The Shrike&quot;, and Best Director for &quot;The Shrike&quot;, &quot;The Fourposter&quot;, and &quot;Stalag 17&quot;, Additionally, Ferrer appeared numerous times in the works of Shakespeare, notably as Iago in Othello.

Ferrer was the father of actor Miguel Ferrer, the brother of Rafael Ferrer, the grandfather of actress Tessa Ferrer, and the uncle of actor George Clooney. His contributions to American theatre were recognized in 1981 when he was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame. In 1985, he received the National Medal of Arts from President Reagan, becoming the first actor so honored.

==Early life==
Ferrer was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the son of Rafael Ferrer, a local attorney and writer, and María Providencia Cintrón, of Yabucoa. His parents were both of Spanish descent. He was the grandson of Gabriel Ferrer Hernández, a doctor and advocate of Puerto Rican independence from Spain. He had two younger sisters, Elvira and Leticia.

The family moved to New York in 1914, when Ferrer was two years old. He studied at the Swiss boarding school Institut Le Rosey. He was adept in several languages, including Spanish, English, French, and Italian.

In 1933, Ferrer completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree in architecture at Princeton University, where he wrote his senior thesis on &quot;French Naturalism and Pardo Bazán&quot;. Ferrer was also a member of the Princeton Triangle Club and played piano in a band, &quot;José Ferrer and His Pied Pipers&quot;. Ferrer then studied Romance languages at Columbia University for 1934–35.

==Career==
===Theatre===

Ferrer&#x27;s first professional appearance as an actor was at a &quot;showboat&quot; theater on Long Island in the summer of 1934.

In 1935, Ferrer was the stage manager at the Suffern Country Playhouse, operated by Joshua Logan, whom Ferrer had known at Princeton. Ruth Gordon and Helen Hayes recommended him to Jed Harris.
Ferrer made his Broadway debut in 1935 in &quot;A Slight Case of Murder&quot; which ran 69 performances.

He could also be seen in &quot;Stick-in-the-Mud&quot; (1935) and &quot;Spring Dance&quot; (1936). Ferrer&#x27;s first big success was in &quot;Brother Rat&quot; (1936–38) which ran for 577 performances. &quot;In Clover&quot; only ran for three performances. &quot;How to Get Tough About It&quot; (1938) also had a short run, as did &quot;Missouri Legend&quot; (1938).

&quot;Mamba&#x27;s Daughters&quot; (1939) ran for 163 performances. Ferrer followed it with &quot;Key Largo&quot; (1939–40) with Paul Muni and directed by Guthrie McClintic, which went for 105 shows and was later turned into a film.

Ferrer had a huge personal success in the title role of &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot; (1940–41), partly in drag, under the direction of Joshua Logan. It went for 233 performances.

Ferrer then replaced Danny Kaye in the musical &quot;Let&#x27;s Face It!&quot; (1943).

===Theatre director and Cyrano===
Ferrer made his debut on Broadway as director with &quot;Vickie&quot; (1942) in which he also starred. It only had a short run.

He played Iago in Margaret Webster&#x27;s Broadway production of &quot;Othello&quot; (1943–44), which starred Paul Robeson in the title role, Webster as Emilia, and Ferrer&#x27;s wife, Uta Hagen, as Desdemona. That production still holds the record for longest-running repeat performance of a Shakespearean play presented in the United States, going for 296 performances (it would be revived in 1945).

Ferrer produced and directed, but did not appear in, &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; (1945–46), starring Mel Ferrer (no relation).

Among other radio roles, Ferrer starred as detective Philo Vance in a 1945 series of the same name.

===&quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;===

Ferrer may be best remembered for his performance in the title role of &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, which he first played on Broadway in 1946. Ferrer feared that the production would be a failure in rehearsals, due to the open dislike for the play by director Mel Ferrer (no relation), so he called in Joshua Logan (who had directed his star-making performance in &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot;) to serve as &quot;play doctor&quot; for the production. Logan wrote that he simply had to eliminate pieces of business which director Ferrer had inserted in his staging; they presumably were intended to sabotage the more sentimental elements of the play that the director considered to be corny and in bad taste. The production became one of the hits of the 1946/47 Broadway season, winning Ferrer the first Best Actor Tony Award for his depiction of the long-nosed poet/swordsman.

On January 9, 1949, Ferrer made his television debut when he starred in &quot;The Philco Television Playhouse&quot;″s one-hour adaptation of the play.

Ferrer directed, but did not appear in, &quot;As We Forgive Our Debtors&quot; (1947), which ran 5 performances. There was another short run for &quot;Volpone&quot; (1947) which Ferrer adapted and played the title role.

===Early films===
Ferrer made his film debut in the Technicolor epic &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1948) as the weak-willed Dauphin opposite Ingrid Bergman as Joan. Ferrer&#x27;s performance earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

At the City Center, he acted in revivals of &quot;Angel Street&quot; (1948) and &quot;The Alchemist&quot; (1948) and directed &quot;S. S. Glencairn&quot; (1948) and &quot;The Insect Comedy&quot; (1948) (also appearing in the latter).

Ferrer had another Broadway hit with &quot;The Silver Whistle&quot; (1948–49) which ran for 219 performances. He performed two shows for &quot;The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse&quot; on TV in 1949: Cyrano, playing the title role, and an adaptation of &quot;What Makes Sammy Run?&quot;, playing Sammy Glick (adapted by Paddy Chayefsky).

Ferrer returned to Hollywood to appear in Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;Whirlpool&quot; (1950), supporting Gene Tierney, and Richard Brooks&#x27; &quot;Crisis&quot; (1950), opposite Cary Grant.

===Film stardom===
Ferrer then played the title role in &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; (1950), directed by Michael Gordon and produced by Stanley Kramer. Ferrer won the Best Actor Oscar, becoming the first actor to win the Oscar for the same role which won him the Tony. The film was widely seen although it lost money. Ferrer donated the Oscar to the University of Puerto Rico, and it was subsequently stolen in 2000.
Ferrer returned to Broadway for a revival of &quot;Twentieth Century&quot; (1950–51) which he directed and starred in, opposite Gloria Swanson; it went for 233 performances. Immediately following, he produced and directed, but did not appear in, &quot;Stalag 17&quot; (1951–52), a big hit running for 472 performances. Even more popular was &quot;The Fourposter&quot; (1951–53) in which he directed Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy; it ran for 632 performances.

Ferrer returned to cinema screens in the comedy &quot;Anything Can Happen&quot; (1952), directed by George Seaton, where Ferrer played an immigrant.

More popular was &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; (1952) in which Ferrer played the role of Toulouse-Lautrec under John Huston&#x27;s direction. Ferrer received 40% of the profits as well as his third and final Oscar nomination.

Back on Broadway, Ferrer directed and starred in &quot;The Shrike&quot; (1952), which ran for 161 performances.

His next two shows were as director only: Horton Foote&#x27;s &quot;The Chase&quot; (1952) only had a short run but &quot;My Three Angels&quot; (1953–54), went for 344 performances.

Ferrer had another cinema hit with &quot;Miss Sadie Thompson&quot; (1953) starring Rita Hayworth. Ferrer briefly revived some of his shows at the City Centre in 1953: Cyrano, &quot;The Shrike&quot;, &quot;Richard III&quot;, &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot;.
He returned to films with &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; (1954) for Kramer, co-starring with Humphrey Bogart and Van Johnson, playing defense lawyer Barney Greenwald; the film was a huge hit. Greenwald&#x27;s Jewish faith, so prominent in the novel that it informed his judgments of the U.S.S. &quot;Caine&#x27;s&quot; officers, was downplayed in the film, as Ferrer, being Puerto Rican, was nominally Roman Catholic.

Also popular was &quot;Deep in My Heart&quot; (1955) where Ferrer played Sigmund Romberg, and which made a profit of over $1 million.

===Film director===
Ferrer made his debut as film director at Universal with an adaptation of &quot;The Shrike&quot; (1955), in which he also starred opposite June Allyson.

Ferrer then performed Cyrano in an episode of &quot;Producer&#x27;s Showcase&quot; on television, directed by Mel Ferrer and co-starring Claire Bloom.

He went to England to star in and direct a war film for Warwick Productions, &quot;The Cockleshell Heroes&quot; (1955), alongside Trevor Howard; it was a success at the British box office.

Ferrer co-wrote, directed and starred in the film &quot;The Great Man&quot; (1956), at Universal. He directed and starred in two films for MGM: &quot;I Accuse!&quot; (1958), where he played Captain Alfred Dreyfus, and &quot;The High Cost of Loving&quot; (1958) a comedy with Gena Rowlands. Both flopped at the box office.

Back on Broadway, Ferrer co-wrote and directed the stage musical &quot;Oh, Captain!&quot; (1958) with Tony Randall, which only had a short run. He directed and starred in &quot;Edwin Booth&quot; (1958), playing the title role; it was not a success.

In 1958, Ferrer narrated the children&#x27;s album &quot;Tubby the Tuba&quot;, which was nominated for the Best Recording For Children at the 1st Annual Grammy Awards.

Ferrer took over the direction of the troubled musical &quot;Juno&quot; (1959) from Vincent J. Donehue, who had himself taken over from Tony Richardson. The show, which starred Shirley Booth, folded after 16 performances and mixed to extremely negative critical reaction.

However, he followed it directing the original stage production of Saul Levitt&#x27;s &quot;The Andersonville Trial&quot; (1959–60), about the trial following the revelation of conditions at the infamous Civil War prison. It was a hit and featured George C. Scott, running for 179 performances.

Around this time, Ferrer also appeared in television in episodes of &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; and &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;.

===20th Century Fox===
Ferrer signed a contract with 20th Century Fox to direct films. He made &quot;Return to Peyton Place&quot; (1961) and &quot;State Fair&quot; (1962), both of which were commercial disappointments.

Ferrer had a key support role in the film &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962) which was a huge success. Although Ferrer&#x27;s performance was only small he said it was his best on screen.

At Fox, he played an investigating police officer in &quot;Nine Hours to Rama&quot; (1963). He also guest starred on &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;.

Ferrer returned to Broadway to star in Noël Coward&#x27;s musical &quot;The Girl Who Came to Supper&quot; (1963–64) which ran for 112 performances.

He narrated the first episode of the popular 1964 sitcom &quot;Bewitched&quot;, in mock documentary style.

Ferrer went to Germany to make &quot;Stop Train 349&quot; (1963) with Sean Flynn. He appeared in the 1964 French film &quot;Cyrano et d&#x27;Artagnan&quot; directed by Abel Gance.

Back in Hollywood, Ferrer played Herod Antipas in &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965) and was in &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; (1965) for Stanley Kramer.

A notable performance of his later stage career was as Miguel de Cervantes and his fictional creation Don Quixote in the hit musical &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;. Ferrer took over the role from Richard Kiley in 1966 and subsequently went on tour with it in the first national company of the show. Tony Martinez continued in the role of Sancho Panza under Ferrer, as he had with Kiley.

Ferrer starred in Carl Reiner&#x27;s &quot;Enter Laughing&quot; (1967) and did a production of &quot;Kismet&quot; (1967) on TV. He went to Europe to do &quot;Cervantes&quot; (1967) and appeared in &quot;A Case of Libel&quot; (1968) for US TV. He also provided the voice of the evil Ben Haramed in the 1968 Rankin/Bass Christmas TV special &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot;. In 1968 the IRS sent him a tax bill of $122,000 going back to 1962.

===1970s===
Ferrer appeared in the television films &quot;The Aquarians&quot; (1970), &quot;Gideon&quot; (1971) and &quot;Crosscurrent&quot; (1971) and guest-starred on &quot;The Name of the Game&quot; and &quot;Banyon&quot;.

Ferrer directed &quot;The Web and the Rock&quot; (1972) on stage in New York and appeared in &quot;The Marcus-Nelson Murders&quot; (1973), &quot;Orson Welles Great Mysteries&quot; (1973), and &quot;Columbo&quot;.

Around 1973, he narrated &quot;A Touch of Royalty&quot;, a documentary on the life and death of Puerto Rico&#x27;s baseball star Roberto Clemente. Ferrer voiced both versions, Spanish and English.

Ferrer voiced a highly truncated cartoon version of &quot;Cyrano&quot; for an episode of &quot;The ABC Afterschool Special&quot; in 1974.

Ferrer appeared in &quot;The Missing Are Deadly&quot; (1975), &quot;Forever Young, Forever Free&quot; (1975), &quot;Order to Assassinate&quot; (1975), &quot;Medical Story&quot; (1975), &quot;The Art of Crime&quot; (1975), &quot;Truman at Potsdam&quot; (1976) (playing Stalin), &quot;The Big Bus&quot; (1976), &quot;Paco&quot; (1976)., &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; (1976), &quot;Crash!&quot; (1976), &quot;The Sentinel&quot; (1977), &quot;Zoltan, Hound of Dracula&quot; (1977), &quot;Exo-Man&quot; (1977), &quot;Who Has Seen the Wind&quot; (1977), &quot;The Rhinemann Exchange&quot;, &quot;The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover&quot; (1977), &quot;Fedora&quot; (1978) from Billy Wilder, &quot;The Amazing Captain Nemo&quot; (1978) (in the title role), and &quot;The Swarm&quot;. He guest starred on &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot; and &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot;.

During the Bicentennial, Ferrer narrated the world premiere of Michael Jeffrey Shapiro&#x27;s &quot;A Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776&quot; for narrator and orchestra with Martin Rich leading the Philharmonic Symphony of Westchester.

Ferrer was a replacement cast member in a production of David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;A Life in the Theatre&quot; (1977–78). He produced and starred in &quot;White Pelicans&quot; (1978) and directed &quot;Carmelina&quot; (1979) on stage but it only ran 17 performances.

He was in &quot;The Fifth Musketeer&quot; (1979), &quot;The Concorde ... Airport &#x27;79&quot; (1979), &quot;Natural Enemies&quot; (1979), &quot;The French Atlantic Affair&quot; (1979), &quot;A Life of Sin&quot;, a 1979 film by Puerto Rican director Efraín López Neris which also starred Raul Julia, Míriam Colón and Henry Darrow, and &quot;Battles: The Murder That Wouldn&#x27;t Die&quot; (1980). He did &quot;The Merchant&quot; on stage in Canada.

===1980s===
In 1980, he had a role as future Justice Abe Fortas in the made-for-television film version of Anthony Lewis&#x27; &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Trumpet&quot;, opposite Henry Fonda in an Emmy-nominated performance as Clarence Earl Gideon.

He also appeared in &quot;Battle Creek Brawl&quot; (1980), &quot;Pleasure Palace&quot; (1980), &quot;The Dream Merchants&quot; (1980), &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, &quot;Evita Peron&quot; (1981), &quot;Berlin Tunnel 21&quot; (1981), &quot;Peter and Paul&quot; (1981) with Anthony Hopkins, &quot;Bloody Birthday&quot; (1981), Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Sex Comedy&quot; (1982) (a classy yet somewhat antagonistic university professor/author whose booming voice both begins and ends the film), &quot;Blood Tide&quot; (1982), &quot;Blood Feud&quot; (1982), &quot;This Girl for Hire&quot; (1983), &quot;The Being&quot; (1983) and Mel Brooks&#x27;s version of &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot; (1983).

From 1982 to 1985, he was artistic director of the Coconut Grove Theatre in Miami.

He guest-starred on &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;, &quot;Another World&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Bridges to Cross&quot;, and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;.

Ferrer was in &quot;The Evil That Men Do&quot; (1984), &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; (1984), and &quot;George Washington&quot; (1984).

Ferrer made his farewell to Cyrano by performing a short passage from the play for the 1986 Tony Awards telecast.

Although not the original actor to play the character, Ferrer, beginning in the third season, had a recurring role as Julia Duffy&#x27;s WASPy father in the long-running television series &quot;Newhart&quot; in the 1980s.

In an interview given in the 1980s, he bemoaned the lack of good character parts for aging stars, and admitted that he now took on roles mostly for the money, such as his roles in the horror potboilers &quot;The Swarm&quot;, in which he played a doctor, and &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Dog&quot;, in which he played a police inspector.

Ferrer&#x27;s final performances include &quot;The Sun and the Moon&quot; (1987), &quot;American Playhouse&quot; (&quot;Strange Interlude&quot; with Kenneth Branagh), &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot; (1989), &quot;Matlock&quot;, &quot;Hired to Kill&quot; (1990), &quot;Old Explorers&quot; (1990) and &quot;The Perfect Tribute&quot;.

He was cast in a Broadway play &quot;Conversations with My Father&quot; (1991) but withdrew due to poor health.

==Personal life==

Ferrer was married five times and had six children:

*Uta Hagen (1938–1948): Ferrer and Hagen met while playing summer stock in Ridgefield, Connecticut in 1938. They had one child, Leticia (born October 15, 1940). They divorced in 1948, partly due to Hagen&#x27;s long-concealed affair with Paul Robeson, with whom Hagen and Ferrer had co-starred in the Broadway production of &quot;Othello&quot;.
*Phyllis Hill (1948–1953): Ferrer and Hill wed on May 27, 1948, and they moved to Burlington, Vermont in 1950. Ferrer returned to Puerto Rico because his mother died. They divorced on January 12, 1953.
*Rosemary Clooney (1953–1961): Ferrer first married Clooney on July 13, 1953, in Durant, Oklahoma. They moved to Santa Monica, California, in 1954, and then to Los Angeles in 1958. Ferrer and Clooney had five children in quick succession: Miguel (February 7, 1955 – January 19, 2017), Maria (born August 9, 1956), Gabriel (born August 1, 1957), Monsita (born October 13, 1958) and Rafael (born March 23, 1960). They divorced for the first time in 1961.
*Rosemary Clooney (1964–1967): Ferrer and Clooney remarried on November 22, 1964, in Los Angeles; however, the marriage again crumbled because Ferrer was carrying on an affair with the woman who would become his last wife, Stella Magee. Clooney found out about the affair, and she and Ferrer divorced again in 1967.
*Stella Magee (1977–1992): They remained together until his death in 1992.
Through his marriage to Clooney, Ferrer was the uncle of actor George Clooney, the father-in-law to singer Debby Boone and actress Leilani Sarelle, and the grandfather of actress Tessa Ferrer.

<doc id="113473" wikidata="Q2015783" url="?curid=113473" title="Office of Strategic Influence">
<text>The Office of Strategic Influence, or OSI, was a department created by the United States Department of Defense on October 30, 2001, to support the War on Terrorism through psychological operations in targeted countries, which did not include the United States because the Pentagon is barred from PSYOPs in the U.S. However, BBC noted that &quot;there is nothing to stop an American newspaper picking up a story carried abroad&quot; in cases of news stories that were &quot;black propaganda&quot; with deliberately &quot;misleading&quot; information planted by the Pentagon under OSI.

Although the closure of the office was announced by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld soon after its existence became publicly known, later comments by Secretary Rumsfeld imply that the actual operations of the OSI have continued unabated. Some sources say OSI was authorized to use &quot;military deception&quot; against the public by &quot;presenting false information, images, or statements&quot;, while other sources say &quot;This type of action
was not in OSI&#x27;s charter, and [this] charge was never substantiated.&quot;

The OSI would have been a center for the creation of propaganda materials, but according to the leaked source, there were no plans to mislead enemy forces or foreign civilian populations. After information on the office spread through US and foreign media in mid February 2002, intense discussions on purpose and scope of the office were reported. Some argue that its secretive nature and stated purposes would make the existence of such an agency hard to determine. The office was closed by Rumsfeld because of the controversy. Some of its foreign responsibilities were moved to the Office of Information Activities.

In March 2022, the US Department of Defense established the Influence and Perception Management Office (IPMO) with the purpose of countering misinformation and spreading pro-US propaganda. Another office called the Defense Military Deception Program Office which according to a US budget document is tasked with &quot;sensitive messaging, deception, influence, and other operations in the information environment&quot; was established in the same year.

==Timeline==
*February 19, 2002: Major US news organizations report that the Department of Defense had set up the Office of Strategic Influence. These reports quote an unnamed official, who is discussing the advantages of and dangers in setting up such an office.
*February 20, 2002: After discussions on the purpose of the Office in the US media, Douglas Feith, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, assures the public in an interview that Defense Department officials will not undermine the credibility of US institutions by lying to the public, and states that the exact mandate of the office is under review.
*February 26, 2002: Rumsfeld announces the decision by Douglas Feith to close the Office of Strategic Influence.
*November 18, 2002: Rumsfeld states in a press briefing that the Office of Strategic Influence was closed down only in name, that the activities of the office still continue. Rumsfeld:

*November–December 2005. It is disclosed that the US Army secretly paid some Iraqi journalists to publish upbeat stories about the US military operations. This is interpreted by some authors as Rumsfeld having kept his word. The Pentagon again announces that it would stop such practices.

<doc id="113479" wikidata="Q3273384" url="?curid=113479" title="Norma McCorvey">
<text>Norma Leah Nelson McCorvey (September 22, 1947 – February 18, 2017), also known by the pseudonym &quot;Jane Roe&quot;, was the plaintiff in the landmark 1973 American legal case &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that individual state laws banning abortion were unconstitutional.

Later in her life, McCorvey became an Evangelical Protestant and in her remaining years, a Catholic, and took part in the anti-abortion movement. McCorvey stated then that her involvement in &quot;Roe&quot; was &quot;the biggest mistake of [her] life&quot;. However, in the Nick Sweeney documentary &quot;AKA Jane Roe&quot;, McCorvey said, in what she called her &quot;deathbed confession&quot;, that &quot;she never really supported the anti-abortion movement&quot; and that she had been paid for her professed anti-abortion sentiments.

==Early life==
McCorvey was born Norma Leah Nelson in Simmesport, Louisiana, and spent her early childhood at her family&#x27;s residence in Lettsworth in Pointe Coupee Parish. Later in her childhood, the family moved to Houston. McCorvey&#x27;s father, Olin Nelson, a TV repairman, left the family when McCorvey was 13 years old, and her parents subsequently divorced. She and her older brother were raised by their mother, Mary (née Gautreaux), a violent alcoholic. McCorvey&#x27;s father died on December 28, 1995. McCorvey&#x27;s mother was raised a Pentecostal but McCorvey&#x27;s father led her and the family as Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

McCorvey had trouble with the law that began at the age of ten, when she robbed the cash register at a gas station and ran away to Oklahoma City with a friend. They tricked a hotel worker into letting them rent a room, and were there for two days when a maid walked in on her and her female friend kissing. McCorvey was arrested and taken to court, where she was declared a ward of the state and a judge sent her to a Catholic boarding school, though she did not become Catholic until 1998.

Later, McCorvey was sent to the State School for Girls in Gainesville, Texas, on and off from ages 11 to 15. She said this was the happiest time of her childhood, and every time she was sent home, would purposely do something bad to be sent back. After being released, McCorvey lived with her mother&#x27;s cousin, who allegedly raped her every night for three weeks. When McCorvey&#x27;s mother found out, her cousin said McCorvey was lying.

While working at a restaurant, Norma met Woody McCorvey (born 1940), and she married him at the age of 16 in 1963. She later left him after he allegedly assaulted her. She moved in with her mother and gave birth to her first child, Melissa, in 1965. After Melissa&#x27;s birth, McCorvey developed a severe drinking and drug problem. Soon after, she began identifying as a lesbian. In her book, she stated that she went on a weekend trip to visit two friends and left her baby with her mother. When she returned, her mother replaced Melissa with a baby doll and reported Norma to the police as having abandoned her baby, and called the police to take her out of the house. She would not tell her where Melissa was for weeks, and finally let her visit her child after three months. She allowed McCorvey to move back in. One day, she woke McCorvey up after a long day of work; she told McCorvey to sign what were presented as insurance papers, and she did so without reading them. However, the papers she had signed were adoption papers, giving her mother custody of Melissa, and McCorvey was then kicked out of the house. Her mother disputed that version of the events, and said that McCorvey had agreed to the adoption.

The following year, McCorvey again became pregnant and gave birth to a baby, Jennifer, who was placed for adoption.

==&quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;==

In 1969, at the age of 21, McCorvey became pregnant a third time and returned to Dallas. According to McCorvey, friends advised her that she should assert falsely that she had been raped by a group of black men and that she could thereby obtain a legal abortion under Texas&#x27;s law, which prohibited most abortion; sources differ over whether Texas law had such a rape exception. Due to a lack of police evidence or documentation, the scheme was not successful, and McCorvey later said it was a fabrication. She attempted to obtain an illegal abortion, but the recommended clinic had been closed down by authorities. Her doctor, Richard Lane, suggested that she consult Henry McCluskey, an adoption lawyer in Dallas. McCorvey stated that she was only interested in an abortion, but agreed to meet with McCluskey.

Eventually, McCorvey was referred to attorneys Linda Coffee and Sarah Weddington, who were looking for pregnant women who were seeking abortions. The case, &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; (Henry Wade was the district attorney), took three years of trials to reach the Supreme Court of the United States, and McCorvey never attended a single trial. During the course of the lawsuit, McCorvey gave birth and placed the baby for adoption. McCorvey told the press that she was &quot;Jane Roe&quot; soon after the decision was reached, stating that she had sought an abortion because she was unemployable and greatly depressed. In 1983, McCorvey told the press that she had been raped; in 1987, she said the rape claim was untrue.

=== Baby at the center of the lawsuit ===

In 2021, Shelley Lynn Thornton was publicly revealed as having been the fetus at the center of the &quot;Roe&quot; case. Thornton became aware that McCorvey was her birth mother in 1989, after a journalist for the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; tracked down Thornton, then a teenager, and told her about her prenatal history. The &quot;National Enquirer&quot; journalist was motivated by McCorvey&#x27;s appearance on the &quot;Today&quot; show, in which she spoke of her desire to meet her daughter. Finding out she was McCorvey&#x27;s birth daughter greatly upset Thornton.

In 1991, Thornton became pregnant and did not have an abortion because, according to Thornton, abortion was &quot;not part of who [she] was&quot;. By 2021, Thornton had met McCorvey&#x27;s two other daughters (Thornton&#x27;s half-siblings), but never met McCorvey. According to Thornton, she and McCorvey had a phone conversation in 1994, in which McCorvey told her that she should have thanked her for not having an abortion. Thornton&#x27;s visceral reaction was &quot;What! I&#x27;m supposed to thank you for getting knocked up... and then giving me away?&quot; Thornton added that she &quot;would never, ever thank [McCorvey] for not aborting [her]&quot;. She reflected that &quot;when someone&#x27;s pregnant with a baby, and they don&#x27;t want that baby, that person develops knowing they&#x27;re not wanted.&quot;

After her public revelation in 2021, Thornton stated she was &quot;neither pro-life nor pro-choice&quot;.

==Anti-abortion activism==
In 1994, McCorvey published her autobiography, &quot;I Am Roe&quot;. At a book signing, McCorvey was befriended by Flip Benham, an evangelical minister and the national director of the anti-abortion organization Operation Rescue. She converted to Evangelical Protestantism and was baptized on August 8, 1995, by Benham, in a Dallas, Texas, backyard swimming pool—an event that was filmed for national television. Two days later, she announced that she had quit her job at an abortion clinic and had become an advocate of Operation Rescue&#x27;s campaign to make abortion illegal. She voiced remorse for her part in the Supreme Court decision and said she had been a pawn for abortion activists.

On August 17, 1998, McCorvey was received into the Catholic Church in a Mass celebrated by Father Edward Robinson and concelebrated by Father Frank Pavone, director of Priests for Life, at Saint Thomas Aquinas Church in Dallas. McCorvey&#x27;s second book, &quot;Won by Love&quot;, described her religious conversion and was published in 1998. In the book, she said that her change of heart occurred in 1995, when she saw a fetal development poster in an Operation Rescue office.

In 2004, McCorvey sought to have the U.S. Supreme Court overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, saying that there was now evidence that the procedure harms women, but the case was ultimately dismissed in 2005. On January 22, 2008, McCorvey endorsed Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul because of his anti-abortion position.

McCorvey remained active in anti-abortion demonstrations, including one she participated in before President Barack Obama&#x27;s commencement address to the graduates of the University of Notre Dame. McCorvey was arrested on the first day of U.S. Senate hearings for the confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States of Sonia Sotomayor after McCorvey and another protester began shouting during Senator Al Franken&#x27;s opening statement. McCorvey appeared in the 2013 film &quot;Doonby&quot;, in which she delivers an anti-abortion message. She is also the subject of Joshua Prager&#x27;s 2021 book, &quot;The Family Roe: An American Story&quot;.

==Personal life with Connie Gonzalez==
Soon after giving birth a third time, as &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; made its way through the courts, McCorvey met and began a long-term relationship with Connie Gonzalez. They lived together in Dallas for 35 years.

After converting to Catholicism, McCorvey continued to live with Gonzalez, though she described their relationship as platonic. Later in life, McCorvey stated that she was no longer a lesbian, although she later said that her religious conversion to Evangelical Christianity and renouncement of her sexuality were financially motivated. McCorvey moved out of the house she shared with Gonzalez in 2006, shortly after Gonzalez suffered a stroke.

==Death==
Norma McCorvey died of cardiac arrest in Katy, Texas, on February 18, 2017, at the age of 69.

==&quot;AKA Jane Roe&quot; documentary==

On May 22, 2020, a documentary titled &quot;AKA Jane Roe&quot; aired on FX, describing McCorvey&#x27;s life and the financial incentives to change her views on abortion. In an interview conducted for the film shortly before her death, in what she referred to as her &quot;deathbed confession&quot;, McCorvey said her anti-abortion activism had been &quot;all an act&quot;, which she did because she was paid, stating that she did not care whether a woman got an abortion. &quot;I was the big fish. I think it was a mutual thing. I took their money and they&#x27;d put me out in front of the cameras and tell me what to say. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;d say,&quot; McCorvey said. &quot;If a young woman wants to have an abortion, that&#x27;s no skin off my ass. That&#x27;s why they call it choice&quot;, she added.

Robert Schenck, a formerly anti-abortion evangelical pastor who worked with McCorvey, verified the claim made in the documentary of McCorvey receiving financial compensation. He acknowledged that his group paid McCorvey to speak against abortion, stating: &quot;Her name and photo would command some of the largest windfalls of dollars for my group and many others, but the money we gave her was modest. More than once, I tried to make up for it with an added check, but it was never fair.&quot; According to tax documents, McCorvey received at least $450,000 from anti-abortion groups during her years as an activist. Schenck said that he was surprised that McCorvey said she favored abortion rights, although he said that he knew she &quot;harboured doubts about the pro-life message she was telegraphing&quot;.

Pavone, who had a decades long association with McCorvey, said that she was not on the payroll of his organization, Priests for Life, and said that he did not believe that McCorvey&#x27;s activism was disingenuous saying, &quot;I can even see her being emotionally cornered to get those words out of her mouth, but the things that I saw in 22 years with her—the thousands and thousands of conversations that we had—that was real.&quot; He later wrote, &quot;So abortion supporters are claiming Norma McCorvey, the Jane Roe of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, wasn&#x27;t sincere in her conversion. She was. I was her spiritual guide for 22 years, received her into the Catholic Church, kept regular contact, spoke with her the day she died, and conducted her funeral.&quot; 

Abby Johnson, who worked for Planned Parenthood before joining the anti-abortion movement, said that McCorvey called her on the phone days before her death to express remorse for abortion. Johnson said that she believed McCorvey was a damaged woman who should not have been thrust into the spotlight so quickly after turning against abortion saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t have any problem believing that in the last year of her life that she tried to convince herself abortion was OK. But I know at the end of her life, she did not believe that.&quot;

<doc id="113482" wikidata="Q2358366" url="?curid=113482" title="Omagh bombing">
<text>The Omagh bombing was a car bombing on 15 August 1998 in the town of Omagh in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. It was carried out by the Real Irish Republican Army (Real IRA), a Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) splinter group who opposed the IRA&#x27;s ceasefire and the Good Friday Agreement, signed earlier in the year. The bombing killed 29 people and injured about 220 others, making it the deadliest incident of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Telephoned warnings which did not specify the location had been sent almost forty minutes beforehand, and police inadvertently moved people toward the bomb.

The bombing caused outrage both locally and internationally, spurred on the Northern Ireland peace process, and dealt a severe blow to the dissident Irish republican campaign. The Real IRA denied that the bomb was intended to kill civilians and apologised; shortly after, the group declared a ceasefire. The victims included people of many backgrounds and ages: Protestants, Catholics, six teenagers, six children, a woman pregnant with twins, two Spanish tourists and others on a day trip from the Republic of Ireland. Both unionists and Irish nationalists were killed and injured. As a result of the bombing, new anti-terrorism laws were swiftly enacted by the United Kingdom and Ireland.

British, Irish and US intelligence agencies allegedly had information which could have prevented the bombing, most of which came from double agents inside the Real IRA, but this information was not given to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). In 2008, the BBC reported that British intelligence agency GCHQ had been monitoring conversations between the bombers as the bomb was being driven into Omagh.

A 2001 report by the Police Ombudsman said that the RUC Special Branch failed to act on prior warnings and criticised the RUC&#x27;s investigation of the bombing. Police reportedly obtained circumstantial and coincidental evidence against some suspects, but were unable to convict. Colm Murphy was tried and convicted of conspiring to cause the bombing, but was released on appeal after it was revealed that the Garda Síochána forged interview notes used in the case. Murphy&#x27;s nephew Sean Hoey was also tried but was acquitted. In June 2009, the victims&#x27; families won a £1.6 million civil action settlement against four defendants, who were found liable for the bombing. In 2014, Seamus Daly was charged with the murder of 29 people; the case against him was withdrawn in 2016.

== Background ==

After negotiations to end the Troubles had failed in 1996, there was a resumption of political violence in Northern Ireland which peaked during the Drumcree crises. The peace process resumed in 1997. Sinn Féin accepted the Mitchell Principles in September 1997, which involved commitment to non-violence, as part of the peace process negotiations. Dissident members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), who considered this as a betrayal of the republican struggle for a united Ireland, left in October 1997 to form the Real Irish Republican Army (Real IRA).

The Real IRA&#x27;s tactics were the same as those of the IRA before it. It targeted the British security forces and carried out bombings of symbolic or economic targets. The goal was to damage the economy and cause severe disruption, thereby putting pressure on the British government to withdraw from Northern Ireland. Warnings were sent before such bombings, along with a code word so that the authorities would know it was genuine. The Real IRA began its paramilitary campaign with an attempted car bombing in Banbridge, County Down, on 7 January 1998. The explosive was defused by security forces. Over the following months, it mounted several car bomb and mortar attacks. There were also attacks or attempted attacks in Moira, Portadown, Armagh, Newry, Lisburn, Belfast, and Belleek, as well as another car bombing in Banbridge on 1 August, which caused thirty-five injuries but no deaths.

The Omagh bombing took place thirteen weeks after the Good Friday Agreement of April 1998 was signed. Intended to be a comprehensive solution to the Troubles, the agreement had broad support both in Ireland and internationally.

== Attack ==
=== Preparation and warnings ===

On 13 August, a maroon 1991 Vauxhall Cavalier was stolen from outside a house at St Macartan’s Villas in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, Republic of Ireland. At that time, it bore the County Donegal registration number 91-DL-2554. The bombers replaced its Republic of Ireland number plates with fake Northern Ireland plates (MDZ 5211), and loaded the car with about of fertiliser-based explosives.

On Saturday 15 August, the bomb car was driven from County Monaghan across the Irish border to Omagh, County Tyrone, travelling north and west. A &#x27;scout car&#x27; drove ahead of the bomb car to warn it of any checkpoints, and the two cars were in constant contact by mobile phone. At 14:19, the bomb car was parked outside S.D. Kells&#x27; clothes shop on Omagh&#x27;s Market Street, at the eastern edge of the town centre, near the crossroads with Dublin Road. The driver could not find a parking space near the intended target, Omagh Courthouse. The two male bombers armed the bomb and set the timer to detonate it in forty minutes. They left the car and walked east down Market Street towards Campsie Road, before leaving Omagh in the scout car. A family of Spanish tourists happened to take photos next to the car; the man and child in the photograph survived but the photographer did not.

At around 14:30, three phone calls were made warning of a bomb in Omagh, using the same codeword that had been used in the Real IRA&#x27;s bombing in Banbridge two weeks earlier: &quot;Martha Pope&quot;. The calls were made from telephone boxes many miles away in southern County Armagh. The first warning was telephoned to Ulster Television saying, &quot;There&#x27;s a bomb, courthouse, Omagh, main street, 500lb, explosion thirty minutes.&quot; One minute later, the office received a second warning saying, &quot;Bomb, Omagh town, fifteen minutes.&quot; The caller claimed the warning on behalf of &quot;Óglaigh na hÉireann&quot;. The next minute, the Coleraine office of the Samaritans received a call stating that a bomb would go off on the &quot;main street&quot; of Omagh &quot;about 200 yards&quot; (180 m) from the courthouse. The recipients passed on the information to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC).

BBC News stated that police &quot;were clearing an area near the local courthouse, forty minutes after receiving a telephone warning, when the bomb detonated. But the warning was unclear and the wrong area was evacuated.&quot; The warnings mentioned &quot;main street&quot; when there was no street by that name in Omagh, although Market Street–High Street was the town&#x27;s main shopping street. It runs for hundreds of yards east–west from the site of the bomb to the courthouse. Given the warnings, police believed the bomb was near the courthouse, so they evacuated the surrounding buildings and streets. As it happened, they moved people away from the courthouse and towards the site of the bomb, placing a cordon at Scarffe&#x27;s Entry. The courthouse is roughly from the spot where the car bomb was parked. During the later Special Criminal Court trial of Real IRA director Michael McKevitt, witnesses for the prosecution said that the inaccurate warnings were accidental. McKevitt was a former &quot;quartermaster general&quot; in the Provisional IRA.

=== Explosion and aftermath ===

The car bomb exploded at 15:04 BST in the crowded shopping area. It tore the car into deadly shrapnel and created a fireball and shockwave. People were caught in &quot;a storm&quot; of glass, masonry and metal, as the blast destroyed shop fronts and blew the roofs off buildings. A thick cloud of dust and smoke filled the street. The blast was so strong that it tore up concrete and pipes burst; the water, running down the street, turned red from the blood of dead and wounded people. Within twenty-five minutes journalists were on the street taking pictures. Twenty-one people who had been standing near the bomb were killed outright. Eight more died on the way to or in a hospital.

Injured survivor Marion Radford described hearing an &quot;unearthly bang&quot;, followed by &quot;an eeriness, a darkness that had just come over the place&quot;, then screams as she saw &quot;bits of bodies, limbs&quot; on the ground while she searched for her 16-year-old son, Alan. She later discovered he had been killed yards away from her after the two became separated minutes before the blast.

BBC News said that survivors described scenes of &quot;utter carnage,&quot; with the dead and dying &quot;strewn across the street and other victims screaming for help&quot;. The injured were initially taken to two local hospitals, the Tyrone County Hospital and the Erne Hospital. A local leisure centre was set up as a casualty field centre, and the British Army&#x27;s Lisanelly Barracks served as a makeshift morgue. According to the Conflict Archive on the Internet, rescue workers likened the scene to &quot;battlefield conditions&quot;. Tyrone County Hospital became overwhelmed, and appealed for local doctors to come in to help.

Because of the stretched emergency services, buses, cars and helicopters were used to take the victims to other hospitals in Northern Ireland, including the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry. A Tyrone County Hospital spokesman stated that they treated 108 casualties, 44 of whom had to be transferred to other hospitals. Paul McCormick of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said, &quot;The injuries are horrific, from amputees, to severe head injuries to serious burns, and among them are women and children.&quot; The morning after the bombing, a man was killed when his car collided with an ambulance ferrying bomb victims to hospitals in Belfast.

Omagh Leisure Centre was used as a base for relatives and friends of the victims. There they could receive news updates. Twenty-nine people were killed, eighteen Catholics (including two Spaniards), ten Protestants and one Mormon. The last victim to die, Seán McGrath, was in critical condition in hospital for three weeks before dying from his injuries on 5 September.

=== Reactions ===
There was a strong regional and international outcry against &#x27;dissident&#x27; republicans and in favour of the Northern Ireland peace process. Prime Minister Tony Blair called the bombing an &quot;appalling act of savagery and evil.&quot; Queen Elizabeth II expressed her sympathies to the victims&#x27; families, while the Prince of Wales paid a visit to the town and spoke with the families of some of the victims. Pope John Paul II and President Bill Clinton also expressed their sympathies. The Spanish Ambassador to Ireland visited some of the injured.

Churches across Northern Ireland called for a national day of mourning. Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh Robin Eames said on BBC Radio that, &quot;From the Church&#x27;s point of view, all I am concerned about are not political arguments, not political niceties. I am concerned about the torment of ordinary people who don&#x27;t deserve this.&quot;

Social Democratic and Labour Party leader John Hume called the perpetrators of the bombing &quot;undiluted fascists&quot;. Sinn Féin&#x27;s Martin McGuinness said, &quot;This appalling act was carried out by those opposed to the peace process,&quot; while Gerry Adams said, &quot;I am totally horrified by this action. I condemn it without any equivocation whatsoever.&quot; McGuinness mentioned that both Catholics and Protestants alike were injured and killed, saying, &quot;All of them were suffering together. I think all them were asking the question &#x27;Why?&#x27;, because so many of them had great expectations, great hopes for the future.&quot; Sinn Féin as an organisation initially refused to co-operate with the investigation into the attack because the RUC was involved. On 17 May 2007, McGuinness stated that Irish republicans would co-operate with an independent, international investigation if one were created.

The security forces believed the Real IRA were responsible. RUC Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan accused the bombers of deliberately trying to direct civilians towards the bomb.

As the trial of a suspect started in 2006, British government prosecutor Gordon Kerr called the warnings &quot;not only wrong but... meaningless&quot; and said that the nature of the warnings made it inevitable that people would be moved towards the bomb.

Three days after the bombing, the Real IRA claimed responsibility for planting the bomb but strongly denied intending to kill civilians and apologised to the victims. It also announced that &quot;all military operations have been suspended&quot;. The group came under intense pressure to end its campaign. IRA members visited the homes of sixty people connected with the Real IRA, and ordered them to disband and stop interfering with its arms dumps. On 7 September, the Real IRA called a ceasefire, although it would later resume its campaign. The Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) also called a ceasefire on 22 August. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism has accused the INLA of providing supplies for the bombing. The INLA continued to observe the ceasefire and later began to disarm. BBC News reported that, &quot;Like the other bombings in the early part of 1998 in places like Lisburn and Banbridge, Omagh was a conscious attempt by republicans who disagreed with the political strategy of Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, to destabilise Northern Ireland in that vulnerable moment of hope. It failed – but there is a terrible irony to the way in which the campaign was halted only by the wave of revulsion triggered by the carnage at Omagh.&quot;

In response to the bombing, both the British and Irish governments vowed to enact tougher anti-terrorism laws. On 3 September, the British parliament passed the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998, and the Irish parliament passed the Offences Against The State (Amendment) Bill. Members of both governments described the measures as &quot;draconian&quot; and the bills were rushed through, despite protests from members of parliament and civil liberties groups. The new measures included allowing suspected members of terrorist groups to be convicted on the word of a senior police officer, curtailment of the right to silence, and longer detention periods.

== Responsibility ==
=== Allegations ===
The Real IRA claimed responsibility for the bombing at the time. On 7 February 2008, a Real IRA spokesman stated that the group &quot;had minimal involvement in Omagh. Our code word was used; nothing more. To have stated this at the time would have been lost in an understandable wave of emotion. ... Omagh was an absolute tragedy. Any loss of civilian life is regrettable.&quot;

On 9 October 2000, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; programme aired the special &quot;Who Bombed Omagh?&quot;, hosted by journalist John Ware. The programme quoted RUC Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan as saying, &quot;Sadly up to this point we haven&#x27;t been able to charge anyone with this terrible atrocity.&quot; &quot;Panorama&quot; alleged that the police on both sides of the Irish border knew the identity of the bombers. It said, &quot;As the bomb car and the scout car headed for the border, the police believe they communicated by mobile phone. This is based on an analysis of calls made in the hours before, during and after the bombing. This analysis may prove to be the key to the Omagh bomb investigation.&quot; Using the phone records, the programme reported the names of the four prime suspects as Oliver Traynor, Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy, and Seamus Daly. The police had leaked the information to the BBC since it was too circumstantial and coincidental to be used in court.

Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson praised the &quot;Panorama&quot; programme, calling it &quot;a very powerful and very professional piece of work&quot;. Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern criticised it, saying that &quot;bandying around names on television&quot; could hinder attempts to secure convictions. First Minister David Trimble stated that he had &quot;very grave doubts&quot; about it. Lawrence Rush, whose wife Elizabeth died in the bombing, tried legally to block the programme from being broadcast, saying, &quot;This is media justice, we can&#x27;t allow this to happen&quot;. Democratic Unionist Party assembly member Oliver Gibson, whose niece Esther died in the bombing, said that the government did not have the will to pursue those responsible and welcomed the programme.

The police believe that the bombing of BBC Television Centre in London on 4 March 2001 was a revenge attack for the broadcast. On 9 April 2003, the five Real IRA members behind the BBC bombing were convicted and sentenced to between sixteen and twenty-two years.

=== Prosecutions and court cases ===
On 22 September 1998, the RUC and Gardaí arrested twelve men in connection with the bombing. They subsequently released all of them without charge. On 25 February 1999, they questioned and arrested at least seven suspects. Builder and publican Colm Murphy, from Ravensdale, County Louth, was charged three days later for conspiracy and was convicted on 23 January 2002 by the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s Special Criminal Court. He was sentenced to fourteen years. In January 2005, Murphy&#x27;s conviction was quashed and a retrial was ordered by the Court of Criminal Appeal, on the grounds that two Gardaí had falsified interview notes, and that Murphy&#x27;s previous convictions were improperly taken into account by the trial judges.

On 28 October 2000, the families of four children killed in the bombing – James Barker, 12, Samantha McFarland, 17, Lorraine Wilson, 15, and 20-month-old Breda Devine – launched a civil action against the suspects named by the &quot;Panorama&quot; programme. On 15 March 2001, the families of all twenty-nine people killed in the bombing launched a £2-million civil action against Real IRA suspects Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy, Seamus Daly, Seamus McKenna and Michael McKevitt. Former Northern Ireland secretaries Peter Mandelson, Tom King, Peter Brooke, Lord Hurd, Lord Prior and Lord Merlyn-Rees signed up in support of the plaintiffs&#x27; legal fund. The civil action began in Northern Ireland on 7 April 2008.

On 6 September 2006, Murphy&#x27;s nephew, Sean Hoey, an electrician from Jonesborough, County Armagh, went on trial accused of twenty-nine counts of murder, and terrorism and explosives charges. Upon its completion, Hoey&#x27;s trial found on 20 December 2007 that he was not guilty of all 56 charges against him.

On 24 January 2008, former Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan apologised to the victims&#x27; families for the lack of convictions in relation to the Omagh bombing. This apology was rejected by some of the victims&#x27; families. After the Hoey verdict, BBC News reporter Kevin Connolly stated, &quot;The Omagh families were dignified in defeat, as they have been dignified at every stage of their fight for justice. Their campaigning will go on, but the prospect is surely receding now that anyone will ever be convicted of murdering their husbands and brothers and sisters and wives and children.&quot; Police Service of Northern Ireland Chief Constable Sir Hugh Orde stated that he believed there would be no further prosecutions.

On 8 June 2009, the civil case taken by victims&#x27; relatives concluded, with McKevitt, Campbell, Murphy and Daly being found to have been responsible for the bombing. McKenna (died 14 July 2013) was cleared of involvement. The others were held liable for of damages. It was described as a &quot;landmark&quot; damages award internationally. Murphy and Daly appealed and were granted a retrial, but this second trial also found them responsible for the bombing, with the judge describing the evidence as overwhelming.

On 10 April 2014 Daly was charged with murdering the twenty-nine victims of the Omagh bombing and with other offences. He was arrested in Newry by police after he crossed the border into Northern Ireland. The case against Daly was withdrawn in February 2016, with the Public Prosecution Service deciding there was &quot;no reasonable prospect of conviction&quot;.

In 2021, Michael Gallagher, whose son Aiden was killed during the attack, brought a case to the Belfast High Court which resulted in Mr Justice Mark Horner ruling that when considering certain grounds &quot;there was a real prospect of preventing the Omagh bombing.&quot; Horner also called for new investigations on both sides of the Irish border.

=== Police Ombudsman report ===
Police Ombudsman Nuala O&#x27;Loan published a report on 12 December 2001 that strongly criticised the RUC over its handling of the bombing investigation. Her report stated that RUC officers had ignored the previous warnings about a bomb and had failed to act on crucial intelligence. She went on to say that officers had been uncooperative and defensive during her inquiry. The report concluded that, &quot;The victims, their families, the people of Omagh and officers of the RUC were let down by defective leadership, poor judgement and a lack of urgency.&quot; It recommended the setting up of a new investigation team independent of the new Police Service of Northern Ireland, which had since replaced the RUC, led by a senior officer from an outside police force.

Initially, the Police Association, which represents both senior officers and rank and file members of the Northern Ireland police, went to court to try to block the release of the O&#x27;Loan report. The Association stated that, &quot;The ombudsman&#x27;s report and associated decisions constitute a misuse of her statutory powers, responsibilities and functions.&quot; The group later dropped its efforts. RUC Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan called the report &quot;grossly unfair&quot; and &quot;an erroneous conclusion reached in advance and then a desperate attempt to find anything that might happen to fit in with that.&quot; Other senior police officers also disputed the report&#x27;s findings. Flanagan issued a 190-page counter-report in response, and has also stated that he has considered taking legal action. He argued that the multiple warnings were given by the RIRA to cause confusion and lead to a greater loss of life. Assistant Chief Constables Alan McQuillan and Sam Kincaid sent affidavits giving information that supported the report.

The families of the victims expressed varying reactions to the report. Kevin Skelton, whose wife Philomena died in the attack, said that, &quot;After the bomb at Omagh, we were told by Tony Blair and the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, that no stone would be left unturned ... It seems to me that a lot of stones have been left unturned,&quot; but then expressed doubt that the bombing could have been prevented. Lawrence Rush, whose wife Elizabeth died in the attack, said that, &quot;There&#x27;s no reason why Omagh should have happened – the police have been in dereliction of their duty.&quot; Other Omagh residents said that the police did all that they could. The &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; called the report a &quot;watershed in police accountability&quot; and stated that it &quot;broke the taboo around official criticism of police in Northern Ireland&quot;. Upon leaving office on 5 November 2007, Nuala O&#x27;Loan stated that the report was not a personal battle between herself and Sir Ronnie, and did not lead to one. She stated that the &quot;recommendations which we made were complied with&quot;.

=== Independent bombing investigation ===
On 7 February 2008, the Northern Ireland Policing Board decided to appoint a panel of independent experts to review the police&#x27;s investigation of the bombing. Some of the relatives of the bombing victims criticised the decision, saying that an international public inquiry covering both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland should have been established instead. The review was to determine whether enough evidence exists for further prosecutions. and to investigate the possible perjury of two police witnesses made during Hoey&#x27;s trial. Sinn Féin member of the Policing Board Alex Maskey stated that, &quot;Sinn Féin fully supports the families&#x27; right to call for a full cross-border independent inquiry while the Policing Board has its clear and legal obligation to scrutinise the police handling of the investigations ... We recognise that the board has a major responsibility in carrying out our duty in holding the PSNI to account in the interests of justice for the Omagh families&quot;.

=== Advance warning allegations ===
In 2001, a double agent known as Kevin Fulton claimed he told his MI5 handlers three days before the bombing that the Real IRA was about to bring a &quot;huge bomb&quot; across the border. Fulton claims he also told them who he believed was making it and where it was being made. He said that MI5 did not pass his information over to the police.

RUC Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan called the allegations &quot;preposterous&quot; and said the information Fulton gave his handlers was full of &quot;distortions and inaccuracies&quot;. However, Flanagan admitted that some of Fulton&#x27;s information was not passed to RUC Special Branch due to &quot;an administrative error&quot;. In September 2001, British security forces informer Willie Carlin said the Ombudsman had obtained evidence confirming Fulton&#x27;s allegations. A spokesman for the Ombudsman neither confirmed nor denied this assertion.

David Rupert, an American citizen, was jointly run as an agent by MI5 and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). He worked as a fundraiser for the Real IRA. On 11 August 1998, four days before the bombing, Rupert informed his MI5 handlers that the Real IRA was planning a car bomb attack in Omagh or Derry. It is not known whether this information was passed to the RUC Special Branch.

The Gardaí also had their own agent close to the Real IRA at the time, Paddy Dixon, who stole cars that were used by the group to transport bombs. Days before the bombing, the Real IRA had Dixon steal the Vauxhall Cavalier it would use in the attack. Dixon immediately told his handler, Detective Sergeant John White. On 12 August, White passed this on to his superior, Detective Chief Superintendent Dermot Jennings. According to White, Jennings told him that they would let the bomb go through, mainly so that the Real IRA would not become suspicious of Dixon.

In 2003, a transcript of a conversation between Dixon and White was released. In it, Dixon confirms that Gardaí let the bomb go through and says that, &quot;Omagh is going to blow up in their faces&quot;. In February 2004, PSNI Chief Constable Hugh Orde called for the Republic of Ireland to hand over Dixon. In March 2006, Chief Constable Orde stated that &quot;security services did not withhold intelligence that was relevant or would have progressed the Omagh inquiry&quot;. He stated that the dissident republicans investigated by MI5 were members of a different cell than the perpetrators of the Omagh bombing.

A 2013 independent report concluded that the British, Irish and US intelligence agencies &quot;starved&quot; police in Omagh of intelligence that could have prevented the bombing. The report was commissioned by the victims&#x27; families and produced by Rights Watch (UK).

=== GCHQ monitoring ===
A BBC &quot;Panorama&quot; documentary, titled &quot;Omagh: What the Police Were Never Told&quot;, was aired in September 2008. It revealed that the British intelligence agency GCHQ was monitoring mobile phone calls between the bombers as the bomb car was being driven into Omagh. Ray White, former Assistant Chief of RUC Special Branch, said GCHQ had been monitoring mobile phones at their request. He said he believed GCHQ were listening to the phone calls &#x27;live&#x27;, rather than merely recording them for later. John Ware claimed that a listening device had been hidden in the car and that GCHQ had recordings of what was said. None of this information was given to the RUC in Omagh at the time. Transcripts of the phone calls were later handed over to RUC Special Branch.

=== Independent statutory inquiry ===
In February 2023, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris announced an independent statutory inquiry. As opposed to a public inquiry, the chairman would decide which portions of the investigations could be made available to the public and the press. The inquiry will look into four different issues highlighted by a 2021 High Court ruling, namely the handling and sharing of intelligence, the use of mobile phone analysis, the possibility of the existence of advance knowledge of the bomb, and whether the attack could have been prevented by disruption operations.

=== Public inquiry ===
A public inquiry into the Omagh bombing began on 28 January 2025. The inquiry, which held a preliminary session the previous year, was established by the UK government to investigate whether the Real IRA bombing could have been prevented. The inquiry will not identify the individuals responsible for the attack.

== Victims&#x27; support group ==
The families of the victims of the bomb created the Omagh Support and Self Help Group after the bombing. The organisation is led by Michael Gallagher, whose 21-year-old son, Aidan, was killed in the bombing. Its website provides over 5,000 newspaper articles, video recordings, audio recordings, and other information sources relating to the events leading up to and following the bombing as well as information about other terrorist attacks.

The group&#x27;s five core objectives are &quot;relief of poverty, sickness, disability of victims&quot;, &quot;advancement of education and protection&quot;, &quot;raising awareness of needs and experiences of victims, and the effects of terrorism&quot;, &quot;welfare rights advice and information&quot;, and &quot;improving conditions of life for victims&quot;. The group also provides support to victims of other bombings in Ireland, as well other terrorist bombings, such as the 2004 Madrid train bombings. The group has protested outside meetings of the 32 County Sovereignty Movement, an Irish republican political activist group opposed to the Good Friday Agreement that the families believe is part of the RIRA.

In April 2000, the group argued that the attack breached Article 57 of the Geneva Convention and stated that they would pursue the alleged bombers using international law. Michael Gallagher told BBC Radio Ulster that, &quot;The republican movement refused to co-operate and those people hold the key to solving this mystery. Because they have difficulty in working with the RUC and Gardaí, we can&#x27;t get justice.&quot; In January 2002, Gallagher told BBC News that, &quot;There is such a deeply-held sense of frustration and depression&quot; and called the anti-terrorist legislation passed in the wake of the Omagh bombing &quot;ineffective&quot;. He expressed support for the controversial &quot;Panorama&quot; programme, stating that it reminded &quot;people that what happened in Omagh is still capable of happening in other towns&quot;.

In February 2002, Prime Minister Tony Blair declined a written request by the group to meet with him at Downing Street. Group members accused the Prime Minister of ignoring concerns about the police&#x27;s handling of the bombing investigation. A Downing Street spokesman stated that, &quot;The Prime Minister of course understands the relatives&#x27; concerns, but [he] believes that a meeting with the Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office is the right place to air their concerns at this stage.&quot;

The death of Adrian Gallagher, along with the experiences of his father Michael and those of other families in the Omagh Support and Self Help Group formed the story of the television film &quot;Omagh&quot;, a Channel 4-RTÉ co-production. Film-maker Paul Greengrass stated &quot;the families of the Omagh Support and Self Help Group have been in the public eye throughout the last five years, pursuing a legal campaign, shortly to come before the courts, with far-reaching implications for all of us and it feels the right moment for them to be heard, to bring their story to a wider audience so we can all understand the journey they have made.&quot; In promotion for the film, Channel 4 stated that the group had pursued &quot;a patient, determined, indomitable campaign to bring those responsible for the bomb to justice, and to hold to account politicians and police on both sides of the border who promised so much in the immediate aftermath of the atrocity but who in the families&#x27; eyes have delivered all too little.&quot;

== Memorials ==
=== National remembrance ===

A nationwide minute of silence was observed across the Republic of Ireland at 3:10 p.m. on 22 August 1998; exactly one week after the bombing.

=== Omagh memorial ===

In late 1999, Omagh District Council established the Omagh Memorial Working Group to devise a permanent memorial to the bombing victims. Its members come from both public and private sectors alongside representatives from the Omagh Churches Forum and members of the victims&#x27; families. The chief executive of the Omagh Council, John McKinney, stated in March 2000 that, &quot;we are working towards a memorial. It is a very sensitive issue.&quot; In April 2007, the council announced the launch of a public art design competition by the Omagh Memorial Working Group. The group&#x27;s goal was to create a permanent memorial in time for the tenth anniversary of the bombing on 15 August 2008. It had a total budget of £240,000.

Since space for a monument on Market Street itself is limited, the final memorial was to be split between the actual bombing site and the temporary Memorial Garden about 300 metres away. Artist Sean Hillen and architect Desmond Fitzgerald won the contest with a design that, in the words of the &quot;Irish Times&quot;, &quot;centres on that most primal yet mobile of elements: light.&quot; A heliostat mirror was to be placed in the memorial park tracking the sun in order to project a constant beam of sunlight onto 31 small mirrors, each etched with the name of a victim. All the mirrors were then to bounce the light onto a heart-shaped crystal within an obelisk pillar that stands at the bomb site.

In September 2007, the Omagh Council&#x27;s proposed wording on a memorial plaque – &quot;dissident republican car bomb&quot; – brought it into conflict with several of the victims&#x27; families. Michael Gallagher has stated that &quot;there can be no ambiguity over what happened on 15 August 1998, and no dancing around words can distract from the truth.&quot; The Council appointed an independent mediator in an attempt to reach an agreement with those families. Construction started on the memorial on 27 July 2008.

On 15 August 2008, a memorial service was held in Omagh. Senior government representatives from the UK, the Republic of Ireland and the Stormont Assembly were present, along with relatives of many of the victims. A number of bereaved families, however, boycotted the service and held their own service the following Sunday. They argued that the Sinn Féin-dominated Omagh council would not acknowledge that republicans were responsible for the bombing.

A memorial service was held on 15 August 2018 to mark twenty years since the bombing. A bell was rung 32 times at 15:10, the time the bomb went off, to represent the 31 victims with an extra peal for those who have lost their lives in attacks all over the world. A memorial service was also held on 13 August 2023 to mark the 25th anniversary of the bombing.

=== Media memorials ===
The bombing inspired the song &quot;Paper Sun&quot; by British hard rock band Def Leppard.

Another song inspired by the bombings was &quot;Peace on Earth&quot; by rock group U2. It includes the line, &quot;They&#x27;re reading names out over the radio. All the folks the rest of us won&#x27;t get to know. Sean and Julia, Gareth, Ann, and Breda.&quot; The five names mentioned are five of the victims from this attack. Another line, &quot;She never got to say goodbye, To see the colour in his eyes, now he&#x27;s in the dirt&quot; was about how James Barker, a victim, was remembered by his mother Donna Barker in an article in the &quot;Irish Times&quot; after the bombing in Omagh. U2 guitarist The Edge has described the song as &quot;the most bitter song U2 has ever written&quot;. The names of all 29 people killed during the bombing were recited at the conclusion of the group&#x27;s anti-violence anthem &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; during the Elevation Tour; one performance is captured on the concert video &quot;U2 Go Home: Live from Slane Castle, Ireland&quot;.

Irish state broadcaster RTÉ and UK network Channel 4 co-produced the 2004 film &quot;Omagh&quot; dramatising the events surrounding the bombing and its aftermath. It was directed by Pete Travis and was first shown on television in both countries in May 2004.

<text>The 1920 Summer Olympics (; ; ), officially known as the Games of the VII Olympiad (; ; ) and commonly known as Antwerp 1920 (; Dutch and German: &quot;Antwerpen 1920&quot;), were an international multi-sport event held in 1920 in Antwerp, Belgium.

In March 1912, during the 13th session of the IOC, Belgium&#x27;s bid to host the 1920 Summer Olympics was made by Baron Édouard de Laveleye, president of the Belgian Olympic Committee and of the Royal Belgian Football Association. No fixed host city was proposed at the time.

The 1916 Summer Olympics, to have been held in Berlin, capital of the German Empire, were cancelled due to World War I. When the Olympic Games resumed after the war, Antwerp was awarded hosting the 1920 Summer Games as tribute to the Belgian people. The aftermath of the war and the Paris Peace Conference, 1919 affected the Olympic Games not only due to new states being created, but also by sanctions against the nations that lost the war and were blamed for starting it. Hungary, Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire were banned from competing in the Games. Soviet Russia had just emerged from the Civil War and chose not to attend the Games. Germany did not return to Olympic competition until 1928 and instead hosted a series of games called Deutsche Kampfspiele, starting with the Winter edition of 1922 (which predated the first Winter Olympics).

The United States won the most gold and overall medals at the 1920 Summer Games.

==Host city selection==
In March 1912, during the 13th session of the IOC, the bid on the behalf of Belgium to host the 1920 Summer Olympics was made by Baron Édouard de Laveleye, president of the Belgian Olympic Committee and of the Royal Belgian Football Association. No fixed host city was proposed at the time.

The organizing committee was created on 9 August 1913. It had four presidents:
*Édouard de Laveleye, president of the Belgian Olympic Committee
*Henri de Baillet-Latour, member of the IOC
*Robert Osterrieth, president of the Royal Yacht Club of Belgium
*Charles Cnoops, vice-president of the Belgian Fencing Association

Among the 22 vice-presidents of the committee were people with a military or industrial background, and further people from sports organizations like Paul Havenith, president of the football and athletics club K. Beerschot V.A.C. and Nicolaas Jan Cupérus, president of the Belgian Gymnastics Federation.

The first action of the committee was to send an official letter to the IOC in Paris, confirming Antwerp as the city for the Belgian Olympic bid. With Antwerp confirmed as the Olympic Games host, Belgium began reconstructing the Beerschot Stadium into the . Construction on the new Olympic stadium began in July 1919 and finished in May 1920.

In 1914, a 109-page brochure was created to promote the idea of Antwerp as a host city for the Olympics: &quot;Aurons-nous la VIIème Olympiade à Anvers?&quot; (&quot;Will we have the 7th Olympiad at Antwerp?&quot;). It was sent to all IOC members and was used during the 6th Olympic Congress in Paris in 1914, where the candidacies of Amsterdam (which would eventually host the 1928 Summer Olympics), Antwerp, Budapest, and Rome (which would eventually host the 1960 Summer Olympics) were discussed. Despite a slight preference at the time for Budapest, no final choice was made, and the outbreak of World War I soon afterwards prevented any further progress.

In 1915, Lyon made a bid for the 1920 Games, but after some discussion, they agreed to support Antwerp and postpone their bid until 1924 if Antwerp was liberated in time to organize the Games. The support for Belgium by cousin country France, then the leading country of the IOC, also meant that Amsterdam and Budapest (in an enemy state) had no chance for the 1920 games against Antwerp. 

New candidacies from American cities did not have that disadvantage, and bids were received from Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Atlanta (which would eventually host the 1996 Summer Olympics), while Cuba also submitted a bid for Havana.

However, shortly after the armistice in November 1918, the IOC decided to give Antwerp their first preference, if they were still willing to host the 1920 Games. In March 1919, the Belgian Olympic Committee decided to go ahead with the organization of the Games: on 5 April 1919, at a meeting in Lausanne, Antwerp was officially declared the host city for the games of the VIIth Olympiad.

==Organization==
The 1920 Summer Games organizers had very little time to prepare. The time between the IOC&#x27;s decision of choosing Antwerp as the host city and the opening ceremony was 1 year, 4 months, and 9 days, making this the shortest amount of time for a host city to plan and organize an Olympic edition.

An executive committee was established on 17 April 1919, with Henri de Baillet-Latour as chairman and Alfred Verdyck, the secretary of the Belgian Union of Football Clubs, as general secretary. Seven commissions were created, to deal with finances, accommodation, press relations, propaganda, schedules, transport, and festivities. Finances and scheduling proved to be the two hardest parts to tackle: the program of events only was published in February 1920, six months before the official start of the Games.

Between 23 and 30 April 1920, an ice hockey tournament marked the early start of the Games. Held in the &quot;Palais de Glace&quot; or Ice Palace in Antwerp, it was the first time that ice hockey was an Olympic sport.

The first stone of the new Olympisch Stadion was laid on 4 July 1919 by Jan De Vos, mayor of Antwerp, and inaugurated less than a year later on 23 May 1920 with a gymnastics demonstration.

When the Olympic Games began, the stadium was still unfinished with some events being built over fortifications and others using existing locations. The athletes quarters were crowded and athletes slept on folding cots.

The nautical stadium or Stade Nautique d&#x27;Antwerp was built at the end of the Jan Van Rijswijcklaan, using the city ramparts there as a spectator&#x27;s stand. Other events, like shooting, boxing, and equestrian sports, were held at pre-existing locations in and around Antwerp and as far away as Ostend.

The amount of spectators were low throughout Antwerp&#x27;s Summer Olympics since not many people could afford tickets. In the closing days of the Olympic Games, students were allowed to attend the event for free. After the conclusion of the Olympic Games, Belgium recorded a loss of more than 600 million francs.

==Highlights==
* The Olympic Games being a symbol of peace and global solidarity shone at Antwerp. These Olympics were the first in which the Olympic Oath was voiced, the first in which doves were released to symbolize peace, and the first in which the Olympic Flag was flown to display the unity of the world&#x27;s continents through its 5 rings.
* The United States won 41 gold, 27 silver, and 27 bronze medals. Sweden, Great Britain, Finland, and Belgium rounded out the five most successful medal-winning nations, with France and Belgium being the nations that fielded the most athletes, with the United States being only the third by that statistic.
* The Games also featured a week of winter sports, with figure skating appearing for the first time since the 1908 Olympics, and ice hockey making its Olympic debut.
* Nedo Nadi won 5 gold medals in the fencing events. 
* At the age of 72, Sweden&#x27;s 100 metre running deer double-shot event champion Oscar Swahn, who had participated in the 1908 and 1912 Games, came in second in the team event to become the oldest Olympic medal winner ever.
* 23-year-old Paavo Nurmi won the 10,000 m and 8000 m cross country races, took another gold in team cross country, and a silver in the 5000 m run. His contributions for Finland broke a record in track and field with 9 medals.
* Duke Kahanamoku retained the 100 m swimming title he won before the war.
* The sailing events were among some of strangest moments in Olympic history:
**there were originally 16 events scheduled but there were no entrants for the 9 metre, 1907 rating class nor the 8.5 metre 1919 rating class
**the 12-foot dinghy event took place in two different countries. The final two races in the event were independently held in the Netherlands, on its own accord, supposedly because the only two competitors in the event were Dutch.
*Sport shooter Guilherme Paraense won Brazil&#x27;s very first gold medal at the Olympic Games.
*The United States sent a women&#x27;s swimming team for the first time, and the Americans won seven out of seven available swimming medals.

==Sports/Events==

There were 162 events in 28 disciplines that were part of the Olympic program in 1920. The number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.
Korfball was a demonstration sport.
Women&#x27;s water polo was a demonstration sport.

==Venues==
Seventeen sports venues were used in the 1920 Summer Olympics. This marked the first time that the football tournament was spread throughout the country, which has mostly been the case since.

==Participating nations==
A total of 29 nations participated in the Antwerp Games, only one more than in 1912, as Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey were not invited, having lost World War I and sanctioned for starting it. From the newly created European states, only Estonia took part, as Czechoslovakia succeeded Bohemia and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes succeeded Serbia, with both nations had sent athletes prior to World War I (in the case of Bohemia as part of the Austrian Empire). Soviet Russia was busy with the Polish-Soviet War and therefore was unable to form an Olympic team (Poland in turn, had never participated in the games before, only doing so in later editions). Brazil and Monaco competed as nations at the Olympic Games for the first time. New Zealand, which had competed as part of a combined team with Australia in 1908 and 1912, competed on its own for the first time. The games marked the return of Argentina and India to the competitions.

At the time, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India and South Africa were all part of the British Empire. Egypt was a British protectorate (a state not part of the British Empire but nonetheless administered by the United Kingdom).
* The had one competitor, Eric Robertson. But as the dominion had no official Olympic committee, his nationality could not be confirmed and he represented Great Britain.

As the local Olympic Organizing Committee went bankrupt during the Antwerp 1920 Games, no official report of the Games was ever produced. The documents of the Games were archived at the Belgium Olympic Committee headquarters in Brussels.

<text>A quodlibet (; Latin for &quot;whatever you wish&quot; from &quot;&quot;, &quot;what&quot; and &quot;&quot;, &quot;pleases&quot;) is a musical composition that combines several different melodies—usually popular tunes—in counterpoint, and often in a light-hearted, humorous manner.

There are three main types of quodlibet:
* A &quot;catalogue quodlibet&quot; consists of a free setting of catalogue poetry (usually humorous lists of loosely related items).
* In a &quot;successive quodlibet&quot;, one voice has short musical quotations and textual quotations while the other voices provide homophonic accompaniment.
* In a &quot;simultaneous quodlibet&quot;, two or more pre-existing melodies are combined. The simultaneous quodlibet may be considered a historical antecedent to the modern-day musical mashup. Simultaneous quodlibets are found in elementary music classes, referred to as Partner Songs.

== History ==
=== Renaissance ===
The quodlibet originated in 15th-century Europe, during a time when the practice of combining folk tunes was popular. Composer Wolfgang Schmeltzl first used the term in a specifically musical context in 1544.

Francisco de Peñalosa&#x27;s quodlibet &quot;Por las sierras de Madrid&quot; occurs in the &quot;Cancionero Musical de Palacio&quot;, a manuscript of the early 16th century. Composer Ludwig Senfl (1486–1542/43) was able to juxtapose several pre-existing melodies in a cantus firmus quodlibet; one such piece, &quot;&quot; / &quot;Es taget&quot;, was noted for its symbolism rather than its humor. In Spain, 1581 saw the publication of the &quot;ensaladas&quot; of Mateo Flecha et al. The &quot;ensaladas&quot; were comical compositions that mixed literary texts in a way similar to the quodlibet.

It was not until 1618, however, that anyone published a rigorous definition of the quodlibet: Michael Praetorius described it as &quot;a mixture of diverse elements quoted from sacred and secular compositions&quot;. During the Renaissance, a composer&#x27;s ability to juxtapose several pre-existing melodies, such as in the cantus firmus quodlibet, was considered the ultimate mastery of counterpoint.

=== 19th century to today ===
The quodlibet took on additional functions between the beginning and middle of the 19th century, when it became known as the &quot;potpourri&quot; and the &quot;musical switch&quot;. In these forms, the quodlibet would often feature anywhere from six to fifty or more consecutive &quot;quotations&quot;; the distinct incongruity between words and music served as a potent source of parody and entertainment. In the 20th century, the quodlibet remained a genre in which well-known tunes and/or texts were quoted, either simultaneously or in succession, generally for humorous effect.

== Examples ==
=== Classical music ===
* The masses of Jacob Obrecht, which sometimes combine popular tunes, plainsong and original music.
* The last (thirtieth) variation of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; is a quodlibet.
* Bach&#x27;s &quot;Wedding Quodlibet&quot; or &quot;Quodlibet&quot;, which is not a quodlibet by the above definition but a ten-minute procession of nonsense, jokes, puns, obscure cultural references, word games, and parody of other songs. At times, the music imitates a chaconne and a fugue while deliberately obscuring the counterpoint. It is unlike any of Bach&#x27;s other works, though the sole surviving source is a fair copy manuscript in Bach&#x27;s own handwriting.
* &quot;Gallimathias musicum&quot;, a 17-part quodlibet composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart at the age of ten.
* Louis Moreau Gottschalk combined &quot;Hail, Columbia&quot; and &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; at the end of his piano piece, &quot;The Union&quot;.
* Symphony No. 4 of Charles Ives, like most of Ives&#x27; music, includes frequent popular and band tunes which unfold independently from the rest of the music.
* Scherzo from Charles Ives&#x27; piano trio labeled &quot;TSIAJ&quot; (This scherzo is a joke), includes the American fraternity tunes &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot;, &quot;Sailor&#x27;s Hornpipe&quot;, &quot;The Campbells Are Coming&quot;, &quot;Long, Long Ago&quot;, &quot;Hold the Fort&quot;, and &quot;There Is a Fountain Filled with Blood&quot;, among others.
* &quot;Quodlibet on Welsh Nursery Rhymes&quot; by Welsh composer Alun Hoddinott.
* Pianist Glenn Gould improvised a quodlibet including &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; and &quot;God Save the King&quot;. According to his account, Gould came up with this quodlibet while taking a bath.
* Peter Schickele&#x27;s &quot;Quodlibet for Small Orchestra&quot;, &quot;Unbegun Symphony&quot;, &quot;Eine Kleine Nichtmusik&quot;, and others.
* Allan Sherman&#x27;s &quot;Variations on How Dry I Am&quot; from the album &quot;Peter and the Commissar&quot;.
* &quot;Fantasia on Auld Lang Syne&quot; (1976) by Ernest Tomlinson. The composer claims that the piece references 129 works.

=== Popular music ===
* The Grateful Dead&#x27;s medley &quot;That&#x27;s It for the Other One&quot;, on their album &quot;Anthem of the Sun&quot;, includes the movement &quot;Quadlibet for Tender Feet&quot; (sic).
* Scholar Alan W. Pollack has pointed out that The Beatles&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Feeling&quot; is a quodlibet of sorts.
* &quot;I Believe&quot; – Stan Beard and Barry Tucker published a quodlibet arrangement of this popular sacred song with Bach-Gounod &quot;Ave Maria&quot; in 1972.
* Nina Simone&#x27;s 1958 interpretation of &quot;Little Girl Blue&quot; is a quodlibet, combining the Rodgers and Hart melody and lyrics with the melody of the popular carol &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot;.

<text>Icy moons are a class of natural satellites with surfaces composed mostly of ice. An icy moon may harbor an ocean underneath the surface, and possibly include a rocky core of silicate or metallic rocks. It is thought that they may be composed of ice II or other polymorph of water ice. The prime example of this class of object is Europa.

Icy moons warmed by tides may be the most common type of celestial body in the galaxy to have liquid water, and thus the most likely type of object to possibly have water-based life.

Some icy moons exhibit cryovolcanism, as well as geysers. The best studied example is Saturn&#x27;s Enceladus.

==Orbits==
Most known large icy moons belong to giant planets, whose orbits lie beyond the Solar System&#x27;s frost line; the remainder (such as Charon and Dysnomia) formed around dwarf planets such as Pluto and , typically in large impacts not unlike the impact thought to have formed Earth&#x27;s moon. In the case of icy gas giant satellites, an additional requirement is that a moon did not form in the inner region of a proto-satellite disk, which is too warm for ices to condense.

Europa is thought to contain 8% ice and water by mass with the remainder rock. Jupiter&#x27;s outer two Galilean moons Ganymede and Callisto contain more ice since they formed further from the hot proto-Jupiter.

Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan looks and behaves more like Earth than any other body in the Solar System. Titan is known to have stable pools of liquid methane on the surface.
