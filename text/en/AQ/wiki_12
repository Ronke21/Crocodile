<text>Camden is a city in and the county seat of Ouachita County in the south-central part of the U.S. state of Arkansas. The city is located about 100 miles south of Little Rock. Situated on bluffs overlooking the Ouachita River, the city developed because of the river.

The recorded history began in 1782 when a Spanish military post was established on the site of an old French trading post called &quot;Écore à Fabri.&quot; When Ouachita County was formed in 1842, American settlers changed the name to Camden. The city became an important port during the steamboat era when Camden became known as the “Queen City” of the Ouachita. In 1864, Camden became the unintended focus of the Red River Campaign, a major Civil War effort resulting in several significant battles.

In 2000, Camden had a population of 13,154, but it lost 7.4 percent of its residents and recorded 12,183 in 2010. Camden is the principal city of the Camden Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Ouachita and Calhoun counties.

== History ==

=== European exploration ===
The explorers Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet in 1673 and René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, in 1682 established French claims to the land they called Louisiana, which included what would become Camden, and found the Quapaw living at the confluence of the Arkansas and Mississippi rivers. The Quapaw claimed the territory that included this part of the Ouachita basin, but it was also influenced by both Caddo trade and culture. The old Indian trail called the Caddo Trace, leading from the Quapaw villages on the Arkansas River to those of the Caddo on the Red River, crossed the Ouachita River at what is now Camden. French hunters, trappers, and traders, who were drawn to the area by the abundant game, later established a rendezvous point on the high bluff above the crossing. The place became known as Ecore a Fabri or Fabri&#x27;s Bluff (later spelled Fabre).

In late 1762, France ceded Louisiana to Spain. In 1782, the Spanish governor sent a Frenchman named Jean Baptiste Filhiol, known to him as Don Juan Filhiol, to establish a civil and military post in the Ouachita district. Filhiol first chose to locate his headquarters at Ecore a Fabri with the expectation of creating a settlement there. After about two years, he decided to move downriver to the more central site of Prairie des Canots, present-day Monroe, Louisiana. These locations were noted in 1804 by the Hunter-Dunbar Expedition that explored the Ouachita River.

=== Early statehood ===
By 1819, Jesse Bowman, of future Alamo fame, was living at Ecore a Fabri, while the Tate brothers—Andrew, Richard, and George—came up the Ouachita on keelboats. Unable to go farther, they settled up river at a place now called Tate&#x27;s Bluff. In 1824, John Nunn moved to Ecore a Fabri and became one of the early permanent settlers. The Nunn brothers planned to pole freight and passengers upriver toward Washington, Arkansas. Steamboats arrived at Ecore a Fabri in the 1820s and provided it with a direct link to the cotton and commercial markets in New Orleans. Because it was located at the head of practical navigation, Ecore a Fabri became a commercial center and began to grow. Residents of Hempstead County began petitioning for a new road in 1821, and by 1828, the Camden to Washington Road was having additional work and maintenance done. By 1829, a large portion of Hempstead County, including Ecore a Fabri, was broken off by the legislature to form an expanded Union County. In 1842, Ouachita County, named for the river, was formed from the northwest portion of Union. Ecore a Fabri was chosen as the county seat, and its name was changed to Camden at the suggestion of one of the commissioners, Thomas Woodward.

Camden soon became the second-largest city in Arkansas. It was a mercantile center and a bustling river port served by frequent scheduled steamboats carrying passengers and freight. Most traveled between Camden and New Orleans. Camden was also the headquarters for John T. Chidester&#x27;s stagecoach line that served Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas. Chidester&#x27;s company carried the United States Mail from Memphis to Fort Smith for the Butterfield stage line.

=== American Civil War ===

During the Civil War, Camden was the focus of U.S. Army general Frederick Steele’s Red River Campaign of 1864. Steele moved south of Little Rock toward Shreveport, Louisiana, but got only as far as Camden, which he occupied while the Confederates pulled back to defend Washington, Arkansas. Forts Lookout and Southerland were built early in 1864, and the Camden Water Battery was built later in the same year, all to protect Camden from attack. After losing the engagement at Poison Spring and the action at Marks’ Mill, Steele had little choice but to retreat toward Little Rock. Camden and south Arkansas remained in Confederate hands until the end of the war.

=== 20th century to present ===
Before the steamboat era faded, Camden had become a railroad town—served by the mainline of the St Louis-Southwestern Railroad (Cotton Belt) and by branch lines of the Missouri Pacific and the Rock Island railroads. The town remained an important cotton shipping depot through the early decades of the twentieth century. The South Arkansas oil boom of the 1920s resulted in a thriving economy.

In 1927, the International Paper Company built a processing mill at Camden, following development of south Arkansas&#x27; lumber industry. For several decades, Camden was the headquarters of the Clyde E. Palmer newspaper chain, which included &quot;The Camden News&quot;, the &quot;Texarkana Gazette&quot;, the &quot;Hot Springs Sentinel-Record&quot;, and the &quot;Magnolia Banner News&quot;. The daily newspaper in Camden is the original flagship publication of WEHCO Media.

During World War II, Camden was home to one of Arkansas&#x27;s three contract training fields for primary pilots in the United States Army Air Forces. The base was named Harrell Field; ground was broken for it in 1942. The site became surplus to the Army&#x27;s needs in 1944 and was handed over to the US Navy for the Shumaker Naval Ammunition Depot.
Thousands of new jobs were created. The Korean War generated new jobs and activity at the depot, which closed after war&#x27;s end. The city and county redeveloped its facilities and grounds into an extensive industrial area. This was the site of some major defense establishments and multiple smaller industries. A technical campus of Southern Arkansas University is also located there.

In the 1990s, post Cold War downsizing of the defense industry brought severe job losses—and resulting population decline—to the Camden area. The International Paper Company mill closed a few years later, resulting in more job losses. In recent years, however, a partial resurgence of defense contracts and the development of a diversified mixture of small business and professional activity have stabilized the town&#x27;s economy.

Camden was the home of Buckshot Smith (1929-2024) who was America&#x27;s oldest active duty police officer from 2020 until he retired in 2023.

<text>Perryville is a city in and the county seat of Perry County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 1,460 at the 2010 census, an increase of just two persons from 2000. It is part of the Little Rock–North Little Rock–Conway Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The first Perry County courthouse was built in Perryville in 1841, a year after Perry County was created, and five years after the state of Arkansas was created. The town was platted sometime before 1850.

John Rison and his new wife, Harriet, moved to Perryville in 1844 and started the community&#x27;s first church, a Methodist congregation. Their log home became a community gathering place and is now the oldest building in Perryville. In 1849, Rison bought six lots across from his home to build a log store and a schoolhouse.

The original log courthouse was burned during a dispute between two families. Historians are uncertain when the courthouse was burned — various sources say 1848 or 1850. Another log courthouse was built on the site.

In 1872, a wood-framed courthouse was built a half mile from the older log courthouse on donated land. It burned in May 1874 and was rebuilt. It burned again in December 1881 and was again rebuilt. Perry County&#x27;s current courthouse was built in 1888 for $4,000.

<text>Elaine is a small town in Phillips County, Arkansas, United States, in the Arkansas Delta region of the Mississippi River. The population was 636 at the 2010 census.

The city is best known as the location of the Elaine massacre of September 30 – October 1, 1919, in which an estimated 237 black people were killed in the rural county by rampaging white mobs. Five whites died in the events. This was one of the worst incidents of racial and labor violence in American history. Black sharecroppers were attempting to organize a farmers&#x27; union, which the planters resisted.

== History ==
Phillips County was developed in the antebellum years for cotton plantations, which relied on the labor of enslaved African Americans. Their work produced the wealth of the major large planters. Cotton continued to be the major commodity crop into the 20th century in this area but, after the war, blacks often had to work as sharecroppers or tenant farmers. By the turn of the century, Arkansas and other southern states had disenfranchised most blacks, excluding them from the political system, and imposed Jim Crow laws.

Black sharecroppers began to try to organize a farmers&#x27; union after World War I. They were seeking better payment and accounting from white landowners of the area cotton plantations. Whites resisted any change and often tried to break up their meetings.

On September 30, 1919, two white men, including a local deputy, tried to break up a meeting of black sharecroppers who were trying to organize a farmers&#x27; union. After a white deputy was killed in a confrontation with guards at the meeting, word spread to town and around the area. Hundreds of whites from Phillips and neighboring areas rushed to suppress the blacks, and started attacking blacks at large. Governor Charles Hillman Brough requested federal troops to stop what was called the Elaine massacre. White mobs spread throughout the county, killing an estimated 237 blacks before most of the violence was suppressed after October 1. Five whites also died in the incident. The governor accompanied the troops to the scene; their use had been approved by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson. Sharecroppers generally remained at a disadvantage in dealing with white landowners.

The county continues to rely on agriculture, but mechanization reduced the need for farm labor. Many African Americans left this area in the Great Migration of the early 20th century. In the 21st century, most farms are industrial scale. Some seasonal Hispanic migrant workers have been hired in this area since the late 20th century.

At 6:15 PM, April 26, 2011, a tornado – part of the 2011 Super Outbreak – hit the Elaine area. The tornado was rated EF0, with estimated wind speeds of . The tornado&#x27;s path of destruction was wide and the tornado traveled a path of along Highway 61 and across the Mississippi state line, ending near Lula, Mississippi. Most of the tornado&#x27;s damage was concentrated in Friars Point and Coahoma, Mississippi.

<doc id="107180" wikidata="Q679084" url="?curid=107180" title="Helena, Arkansas">
<text>Helena is the eastern portion of Helena–West Helena, Arkansas, a city in Phillips County, Arkansas, located on the west bank of the Mississippi River. It was founded in 1833 by Nicholas Rightor and is named after the daughter of Sylvanus Phillips, an early settler of Phillips County and the namesake of Phillips County. As of the 2000 census, this portion of the city population was 6,323. Helena was the county seat of Phillips County until January 1, 2006, when it merged its government and city limits with neighboring West Helena.

During the American Civil War, the Battle of Helena was fought July 4, 1863. Helena is the birthplace of many notable people including prominent African Americans and Arkansas&#x27; former senior United States senator, Blanche Lincoln. Helena is home to the longest running daily radio program in the U.S., &quot;King Biscuit Time&quot;.

Citizens of Helena incorporated the Arkansas Midland Railroad in 1853, intending it to be a fairly straight ”air-line railroad” running west from Helena to Little Rock, Arkansas, about 115 miles. However actual trackage was not completed until 1872, and only ran to Clarendon, Arkansas, about 48 miles. This line later became part of the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway in 1910, but was all abandoned by 1979. From 1906 to 1946, Helena was a terminal point on the former Missouri and North Arkansas Railroad, which provided passenger and freight service to Joplin, Missouri. After a loss of rail service in early 2015, a successful effort was launched by the Helena-West Helena/Phillips County Port Authority to have freight service restored. The service was restored on October 1, 2015, and two new freight customers were quickly gained.

== History ==
=== Battle of Helena ===

In June 1863, Confederate Commander Theophilus Holmes sought to take pressure off of Vicksburg, Mississippi, by attacking the Union-held town of Helena, Arkansas. Holmes planned and executed three different failed attacks on the town. The main attack broke through Battery C, but Union troops fended off the attackers and sealed the breach. The Confederates withdrew on July 4, 1863. There were 1,636 Confederate casualties and 205 Union casualties.

=== Fort Curtis ===

Fort Curtis was built in August 1862 by Union soldiers and freed slaves in Helena. For the next year, it served as a command post for the Union since it was centrally located on the Mississippi River.

Fort Curtis was not directly attacked during the Battle of Helena as the Confederacy focused its attacks on the outlying batteries. The Confederates charged Fort Curtis in their last attack, but the heavy artillery inside kept the attack from reaching the fort.

<text>Marvell is a city in Phillips County, Arkansas, United States. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 1,186.

==History==

Marvell was founded when Marvell M. Carruth and his wife, Rachel, sold 50 lots of land given to him by his father, Ladson Carruth, to the Arkansas Central Railroad. A train depot was soon established. Marvell became an un-incorporated town on May 28, 1873, with R.M. Jackson as its first mayor. Three years later, on October 3, 1876, Marvell became an incorporated town.

In 1877, the Union Trust foreclosed on the Arkansas Central Railroad and sold all of its assets at public auction. 

On December 6, 1877, the Arkansas Midland Railway was formed. Under new ownership, the railroad became profitable, not only as a freight line, but also by providing daily passenger service from Clarendon to Brinkley and on to Helena, making stops in Marvell along the way. This service ran until 1952. The tracks which ran from Marvell to Holly Grove were abandoned in 1977.

In the early 1900s there were 15 different merchants in the city of Marvell. One of the stores that stayed in business the longest was A. Hirsch &amp; Co., which did an immense mercantile business and owned valuable land in the area. The Garner Stave Company sold miscellaneous items, such as farming and manufacturing goods.

The Marvell Public Library was established in 1922 by Mrs. Dave McDonald, who remained active until her death. In 1925, the Marvell Bottling plant was built by James Williford, only to close shortly afterward due to the high cost and shortage of sugar. At the beginning of the Great Depression all banks in Phillips County closed, with the exception of the Bank of Marvell. County Judge E.P. Molitor, a Marvell native, began construction on a road connecting Helena to Clarendon in 1930. 

In the 1980s, under the leadership of Mayor Alma Norton, the Marvell City Park and bike trail were built on the old railroad. The Davidson Park was also built and given to the city by the Abe Davidson family. 

In the 1990s, the population of Marvell was approximately 1545. In 1997 cooperation with UAMS east and grant from federal government the city under mayor Clark Hall, the Marvell Medical Clinic was built with citizen donations. The clinic expanded in only one year to include dental services and interactive two-way compressed video use for medical consultations and health education.

Marvell was featured on ABC News&#x27;s &quot;World News With Charles Gibson&quot; October 6, 2009, telecast as a center of infestation by newer pesticide-resistant strains of pigweed, threatening the region and raising the possibility of hand harvesting crops.

<text>Antoine is a town in Pike County, Arkansas, United States, along the Antoine River. The population was 117 according to the 2010 census.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.3 km (0.5 mi), all land.

==History==
The town of Antoine began as a stopping point on the old Southwest Trail to Texas in the early 19th century. It was named for a French trapper who was found dead at his camp along the road (the site of the present town cemetery). The only identification found on the man was his first name, &quot;Antoine&quot;. He was buried on the hill by the river and the gravesite became a landmark for travelers. Eventually, the name was given to the river and to the town that grew up beside it. Antoine&#x27;s grave is located within the bounds of the town cemetery, although the marker has disappeared over time. Antoine is located on Arkansas Highway 26 between Murfreesboro and Arkadelphia in the southeastern section of Pike County. Antoine was one of the first settlements in what is now Pike County. It had characteristics of what our forefathers were seeking - rich level farmland and located on the bank of the Antoine River, giving them an adequate supply of water. To the north is an elevated mountain range ideal for trapping.

The town did not suffer much disaster during the Civil War, even though Union Soldiers were located in the area. The only incident recalled was about two young Antoine boys whose father was away in the Confederate Army. Being the only men at home they brought corn into Antoine to the gristmill for their mother. As they were leaving they were seized by the Yankee soldiers, their meal taken and the boys hanged from a large chinquapin tree just north of the old John Canter Home.

By 1890 the town had sprung up and had a post office, a bank, a church, school, cotton gin, gristmill, bottling works, sawmill, blacksmith shop, two hotels, drug store, hardware, billiard and pool hall, cafe, doctor&#x27;s office, city hall, and several merchandise stores. During this time, railroad connections were established with Gurdon to the south, Amity to the north, and Delight to the west. The historic railroad trestle over the Antoine River was built in 1908 and remains in use today. The first church house in Antoine was Union Church located where the Methodist Church now stands. Brooks Stell of Delight organized the Church of Christ which was the second church to form. When he held a meeting in the Union Church building in 1908, the response was so great that he continued the meeting and moved his followers to the old Seven-Up school house across the Wolf Creek, near the Joe Thomas home. About this time there was being erected a new two-story brick school house, and when it was completed the congregation bought the little wood-frame school for their meeting place. It was located in the vicinity of where Guy Howell&#x27;s home now stands. The present church building was erected in 1930. The Methodists continued on in the old Union building and later built a beautiful brick building. Sometime later the Baptist Church was organized.

Some of the names associated with the public businesses of Antoine around the turn of the century were blacksmiths: Dan and Charlie Hammonds, the Cagles and Dixons; cotton gin: Cagles and Bartons; bottling works: Mr. Manesco; cafe: George Mires; postmaster, hotel and sawmill: J. T. Cooper; merchandising stores were operated by Barton and Hardin, Charlie Cash, A. D. Meeks and Brooks. The officers and directors of the Bank of Antoine, in 1908, were James P. Dunn, president; O.O. Meeks, vice-president; E. E. Groom, cashier; and Mrs. R. A. Barton and Fred Haptonstad, directors.

Antoine had been plagued with disastrous fires. About 1911 the entire south side where the bank, hardware, drugstore, cafe, and several general stores were located was destroyed. Sometime later the big downtown hotel was destroyed by fire. This was rebuilt by a Mr. Meeks. In 1929 on the north side the structure known as the old Dunn building, burned. It contained Will Smith&#x27;s barber shop, the pool hall, and a general store. In 1947 the school burned. The school was never replaced. The high school had already been consolidated with Delight School and after the building burned the remaining youngsters attended school in Delight. Some of the earlier teachers of Antoine were Professor Groom, Rush Dixon, Myrtice Wingfield, Nellie Stark, Audrie Mansfield, a Mr. Story (who had two sons of his own whom he took upstairs and whipped just as surely as the day began). The most lively teacher of them all was Preacher Hile. J. H. Hile was a teacher and preacher with the Church of Christ around 1900, and how he did love to put on his exhibits! People from all around would load up their wagons ad come to the school to see these performances. Sometimes they would last almost all night.

Some of the older doctors of Antoine were Dr.Hardin, Dr. James, Dr. Baker, Dr. Burleson, and Dr. Hendrix. Antoine suffered another great shock in the death of Dr. Albert Hendrix, a young doctor who had set up practice in an office in Hardin&#x27;s drugstore. He was boarding in the home of George and Mat Mires, and on the evening of January 10, 1913, he had a call to the Piney Grove community to see Mrs. Maude Lee. Finding her condition stable, he decided to check Luther Sparks&#x27; wife, another patient he had been treating, while in the community. While he was making his rounds there had been an extremely hard rain. On his return trip to Antoine, Wolf Creek and Mill Slough overflowed their banks. A new bridge had been built across Mill Slough but the road had not been finished where the bridge could be used for crossing. He tried to cross Mill Slough at the ferry but the current was so strong that when he drove his buggy into the water it was immediately washed away. His buggy was found lodged against the new bridge but his body had been swept away and was found about a quarter mile downstream several days later.

Some of the familiar faces seen around Antoine in 1923 were the Rileys, Canters, Cashes, Rices, Craigs, Bolts, Wombals, Hares, Dixons, Coopers, Morrises, Dunns, Goldens, Carrolls, Walls, Harps, McDonalds, Copelands, Lambs, Gentrys, Smiths, Wingfields, Nashes, Bottoms, Osburns, Lawsons, Prices, Rogers, Bierds, Mays, Rawlings, Calhouns, Howells, Clarks, Hammonds, Phillions, Caldwells, Hankins, Burlesons, Bartons, Jacksons, Stovers, Halls, Sam Jones, Cow Bailey, King Cole, May Ollie, and her twin boys, Troy and Truman. Some of the later businessmen of Antoine, before 1930, were Kelly Caldwell, Will Smith, Ollie Meeks, E. V. Canter, Will Lamb, Clyde Wingfield, Bob Bransford, Olvy Johnson, Bob Rawlings, Olen Hendrix, Kirk McDonald, Jim Wingfield, Joel Wigfield, and Ernest Wingfield.

During the Great Depression and afterwards, Antoine experienced a slow but steady decline in population.

Today, the main activities include: logging, ranching, trucking, farming, and tourism. Most residents work in the nearby cities of: Arkadelphia, Hope, or Nashville.

<text>Delight is a town in Pike County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 279 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Several decades after Pike County was formed and almost seventy years after Arkansas became a state, Delight became an incorporated town. The earliest known inhabitants of the area were the Quapaw Indians, a tribe of the great Dakotas who at one time had a population of many thousands. By the end of the eighteenth century, white settlers had begun making their homes near the banks of Wolf Creek. Some of the earliest residents of the area were the Kirkhams, Kelleys, Dixons, Dosses, Carpenters, Dosseys, Mobleys, Wards, Greens, Lambs, Reeves, Griffins, Clingmans, Wilsons, and Hancocks. On January 18, 1832, a post office was granted and called &quot;Wolf Creek&quot;. In the 1833 Territorial Papers of the United States proposals for mail contracts in Arkansas Territory, Wolf Creek was identified as a mail stop between Little Rock and Hempstead County Courthouse, which was in Washington at that time. The Wolf Creek post office was listed again in 1834, and the amount of postage from the Wolf Creek post office was $13.73 for that year.

On August 21, 1873, Samuel Hasley purchased almost 43 acres of land from the United States for $1.25 an acre. This acreage covers the present site of Delight. A few years later the land was sold to S. B. Dixon and wife, Nancy, who in turn sold it to Abner H. Hancock for $500. On January 4, 1853, he deeded it to David Mobley for the consideration of $700. This land remained in the Mobley family until 1860 when the heirs to David Mobley, then deceased, granted to convey their rights, titles, and interest to William H. Kirkham, his son in law, for the sum of $800. On December 13, 1895, Southwestern Arkansas, an Indian Territory Railroad Company, paid William H. Kirkham $1.00 for a 100-foot right-of-way and other territory through which their railroad was to be built. As the people of the community learned of the coming of the railroad, excitement grew. The prospects of train service brought new life into the community. A town site was provided and the location of the railroad station was selected. As William H. Kirkham, now a Confederate Army Veteran, had generously donated the town site, it was decided that he should choose the town&#x27;s name. Kirkham said, &quot;This is such a delightful place to live, we shall call the town Delight.&quot; The Pike County Court Record B, page 413, contains the proceedings for the incorporation Delight. On July 25, 1904, the petition for incorporation was read before the court and properly filed. It was recorded on September 9, 1905, with John Brock as the first mayor.

The coming of the new railroad brought new industry to Delight. R.B. F Key was interested in the timber business and he saw in the forests of virgin timber a veritable gold mine. He secured a site and proceeded to build a saw mill and planer. Early on a morning 1897 the whistle sounded and the wheels began to turn. Lumber was shipped far and near on the railroad but it was also used to build new houses for the residents of the Delight. Business boomed and so did Delight. Near the town, large deposits of gravel offered more industry. So carloads of gravel was also shipped over the new railroad. Key built a large hotel to accommodate the drummers who descended on the town to sell their wares to the rapidly expanding business district. Some of the early merchants were A. E. Westbrook, C. E. Reid, Bose and Jim Bratton, and the Geiser brothers. O. L Mckinney owned and operated the first cold drink stand. As the town grew, a need for a doctor arose. Antoine, a neighboring town 5 miles away, had shared its Kirkham with the community of Delight for a number of years. So Rice was the first to become the town&#x27;s physician in 1903. After Rice, Rodgers moved to Delight from Mississippi and practiced medicine for several years. Other doctors who gave unstintingly of their time were Walls, Newt Slaughter, Joe Thomasson, W. P. Hemby, and B. S. Stokes. brother, Hosea, operated a drug store. Ed Brewer became the town&#x27;s first post master.

About the year 1909 Key sold his saw mill and planer to the Blakely brothers and for six to seven years they continued to operate the mill. But the forest had been mostly cut over and the saw mill business could no longer be profitable to the owners. So the business was closed and people became interested in other work. Farming was one of the principal occupations with cotton as the leading crop. By 1919 Delight was a very good cotton market. The twenties were very prosperous years. Money was plentiful and credit was easy. When the depression hit in 1930, Delight, like, all other towns and cities across the nation, became paralyzed with fear. But they never gave up hope for a better day. And that day came in 1936, when the Ozan Lumber Company of Prescott began construction of a large saw mill and planer and by January 1937 the wheels of industry began to turn again for the city. New housing projects were completed and for the second time Delight became a thriving mill town.

== Education ==
The community is in the South Pike County School District, which operates Delight Elementary School and Murfreesboro High School.

It was previously a part of the Delight School District, which operated Delight Elementary and Delight High School. On July 1, 2010, the Delight district merged with the Murfreesboro School District to form the South Pike County School District.

The Delight High School mascot was a bulldog and colors are blue and gold. Throughout Delight&#x27;s history basketball has always been a huge part of the community. With a winning tradition the Bulldogs captured state basketball titles in &#x27;55,&#x27;64, and &#x27;94. Along with basketball titles the Lady Bulldogs cheerleaders won the state cheer title in &#x27;02.

Delight High School was suddenly closed in 2010 for lack of students. Nowadays, some students attend Murfreesboro High, located 12 miles away while others go to Blevins High School, which is 15 miles away.

The community historically had a Rosenwald School. In 1965, Delight High School integrated with Simmons High School in Okolona.

<text>Tyronza is a city in Poinsett County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 716 at the 2020 census. It is included in the Jonesboro, Arkansas Metropolitan Statistical Area and is in the Arkansas Delta.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 4.1 km (1.6 mi2), all land.

==History==

Tyronza is one of the oldest cities within Poinsett County with its origins dating back to the late 19th century. In the 1930s, it was the site where the Southern Tenant Farmers movement started what became a national outcry against the abusive discrimination by wealthy land owners against the mostly African-American sharecroppers. A museum in the city, operated by Arkansas State University, highlights the history of organizing by tenant farmers in order to secure better prices and conditions, and the history of the region.

Tyronza was the home of Dr. L. H. McDaniel, a local physician who became friends with President Lyndon Baines Johnson through his political involvement in the Democratic Party. McDaniel was a close advisor to Johnson and to U.S. House Ways and Means Chairman Wilbur D. Mills (D-Arkansas) in the creation of the Medicare and Medicaid programs which began in 1965, the year McDaniel died. He treated patients all over eastern Arkansas regardless of their ability to pay and often accepted live chickens, baked goods and garden vegetables as payment for his home visits. McDaniel was a national delegate to Democratic Conventions in the 1950s and brought national political and medical leaders to Tyronza with conferences he set up in huge 1,000-seat tents on the outskirts of the city.

Although the community started as a county farming and retail center, it has become a bedroom community for its many residents who work in Jonesboro or Memphis but who prefer the small town lifestyle.

=== Socialism ===
Tyronza was historically a hotbed for socialism and communism during the early 20th century. 

In 1934, the Southern Tenant Farmers Union (STFU) was formed in the town to organize local sharecroppers towards getting better arrangements from landowners. 

Ward H. Rogers, a Texas-born minister and labor activist, threatened to hang every plantation owner in Poinsett County, Arkansas if the demands of the sharecroppers were not met.

<text>Mena ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Polk County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 5,558 as of the 2020 census. Mena is included in the Ark-La-Tex socio-economic region. Surrounded by the Ouachita National Forest, Mena is a gateway to some of the most visited tourist attractions in Arkansas.

==History==


Mena was founded by Arthur Edward Stilwell during the building of the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad (now the Kansas City Southern), which stretched from Kansas City, Missouri, to Port Arthur, Texas. Train service to Mena began in 1896.

Stilwell named the town in honor of Folmina Margaretha Janssen-De Goeijen, the wife of his friend and financier Jan De Goeijen, whom Mr. De Goeijen affectionately called Mena. Janssen Park in the center of Mena is also named for her.

Mena was settled in 1896 and incorporated on September 18 of that year. In 1897, the Bank of Mena was founded. The following year, the county seat was moved from nearby Dallas to Mena. Mena&#x27;s population had grown to 3,423 by 1900. The main industries of the area were timber, agriculture and mineral extraction, though it was advertised as a spa city located within a healthy environment. Stilwell donated land to the city in 1906, and a park and campground were constructed. In 1910, the railroad moved its shop facilities from Mena to Heavener, Oklahoma. This created a loss of eight hundred jobs. A private school in Mena, Hendrix Academy, closed in 1905.

There were attempts to intimidate early Black settlers into leaving between 1896 and 1898. In 1901, an African-American man accused of kicking a White girl, was removed from the jail, beaten, and hanged. Local citizens posted a reward for the murderers; there were no arrests. In the mid-1920s, the town advertised that it had no Negroes. In the early 1900s, the Black population declined, and Mena became known as a sundown town. In 1920, the &quot;Mena Star&quot; advertised the city as 100 percent White.

In 1911, a damaging tornado struck the town.

===Recent history===
In the 1950s, a government program to stockpile manganese led to the reopening of local mines closed since the 1890s. The program ended in 1959, and the mines again closed.

During the 1980s, drug smuggler Barry Seal moved his operations to the Mena Intermountain Municipal Airport, where he owned and operated many planes and helicopters, as well as advanced radar equipment. Seal also flew gun and drug smuggling missions between Mena and Nicaragua as part of a CIA scheme to support the Contras. Local law enforcement claimed that attempts to investigate the operation were blocked by the White House.

On April 9, 2009, a large and violent tornado devastated the town, killing three and injuring thirty. Many homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed. The Arkansas National Guard was deployed to the affected area. The tornado was rated as a high-end EF3, with winds near , and damages estimated at $25 million.

==History==
The town is named after Elisha Atkins, a Boston sugar importer who financed the Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad which spawned the growth of the town after the Civil War. It was formally platted in 1872. Atkins built its first school in 1875 and boasted its own newspaper, the &quot;Atkins Chronicle&quot; in 1894. The town served as a local cotton depot with a number of cotton gins operating in town. The 1927 flooding of the Arkansas River damaged the town and subsequent road buildings gradually shifted the town to orient northwards away from the river.

Atkins was the site of the Goldsmith Pickle Company which started producing pickled cucumbers in 1946. The town thus laid claim to be the “Pickle Capital of the World” with some 1200 acres devoted to growing cucumbers. Along the same line Atkins was the original home of the fried dill pickle, created by Bernell “Fatman” Austin. The pickle plant came under owners through the years until 2002 when the plant shuttered but left the town with the two-day &quot;Picklefest&quot; legacy held each May.

<text>Dover is a town in Pope County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 1,378 at the 2010 census. Dover is located in the Arkansas River Valley, and is part of the Russellville Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Dover was either named by British aristocrats in the 1830s for Dover, Kent, England or by Stephen Rye in 1832 for Dover, Tennessee. Incorporated December 31, 1852, Dover was the county seat for Pope County from 1841 to 1887 with the county&#x27;s brick courthouse on the square bounded by present-day Camp, Market, Water, and Elizabeth Streets.

During the American Civil War, what little civil authority there was collapsed throughout Arkansas. By 1863, in most of the state, travel was dangerous, farming hazardous, and county government inoperative. Pope County records at Dover were moved to a cave for protection. Several skirmishes took place in the county, but there were no major engagements. On April 8, 1865, Dover, including the courthouse, was burned.

During the military reconstruction period (1867-1868), companies E and G of the Nineteenth Infantry were stationed in Pope County and headquartered at Dover for a year and a half. Arkansas became the second former Confederate state to be fully restored to the Union in June 1868. However, political and social stability was still years away.

Between 1865 and 1870, at least four county officials were assassinated: Sheriff Archibald D. Napier and Deputy Sheriff Albert Parks on October 24, 1865, County Clerk William Stout on December 4, 1865, and Sheriff W. Morris Williams on August 20, 1866.

On March 1, 1870, the new Pope County jail in Dover was burned. A man named Glover later claimed responsibility.

As the county seat, Dover played a significant role during period of a little over seven months in 1872 and 1873 that came to be known as the Pope County Militia War, with several significant incidents occurring in or near the town. However, there were no battles or skirmishes. There were no engagements between organized opponents of any kind. Instead, an irregular armed group sometimes referred to as a militia, and headed by four county officers, exerted excessive and harsh control over the county, including threats to burn the county seat. By the end of the period, three of the four officials were dead.

Winds from a storm on March 8, 1878, damaged the county courthouse in Dover, rendering it &quot;unfit and unsafe&quot;. With the county having no funds to repair the structure, its condition became a consideration for some in the issue of moving the county seat, with citizens of Russellville offering a building site and $2,500 to build a new courthouse there at no cost to the taxpayers. A church was used for a courtroom during terms of the circuit court while the courthouse was unavailable.

With the new railroad running eight miles south of the county seat at Dover and the gradual relocation of county commerce toward Russellville and Atkins, moving the county seat was inevitable. Russellville was developing into the business center of the county and a newer town, Atkins, was growing fast and would compete as a potential new location for the county seat.

It took 15 years from an act from the Arkansas General Assembly moving the county seat to Russellville—reversed the next year, sending it back to Dover—until the new courthouse was completed in Russellville. Dover had been selected in the 1840s for its more central location in the county. Thirty years later, the southern townships held the majority of the population and paid a large majority of the taxes.

After a judge ordered a March 19, 1887, special election, the county seat was moved from Dover to Russellville after the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the judge&#x27;s ruling on June 4, 1887.

More than half of the businesses in the commercial part of town were lost to fire on February 15, 1930, as were at least 8 homes on two city blocks. At least 11 businesses were lost or badly damaged. A fire truck from neighboring Russellville helped in fighting the fire, but with no municipal fire water system, the truck had to draw water from a large well at a Dover business. Fighting the blaze, thought to have originated as a grass fire, was hampered by the lack of a water supply and high winds. The buildings lost were of wood frame construction.

=== The Simmons massacre ===
On December 22 and 26, 1987, Ronald Gene Simmons, of near Dover, killed all fourteen members of his family during a Christmas reunion at the Simmons property 5 miles north of Dover. Two days later, he continued his killing spree in the county seat of Russellville, having targeted previous employers and co-workers, killing two and wounding two more. Simmons was arrested without resistance, was sentenced to death on December 10, 1989, waived mandatory appellate review, and executed on June 25, 1990, the quickest sentence-to-execution time in the United States since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a land area of .
Ecologically, Dover is located within the Arkansas Valley Hills subregion within the larger Arkansas Valley ecoregion. The subregion is a thin transition area between the flat and fertile Arkansas Valley Plains to the south along the Arkansas River, and the steep and densely forested lands of the Boston Mountains in northern Pope County.

The mild hills historically supported oak-hickory forest or oak-hickory-pine forest. Elevation changes and soil types make the Arkansas Valley Hills largely unsuitable for row agriculture. Instead, forest has been cleared for pastureland, poultry farming or ranching. Logging remains an important land use where elevation or soil makes livestock farming unsuitable. Many of the smaller streams and watercourses are completely dry in summer.

<text>Russellville is the county seat and largest city in Pope County, Arkansas, United States, with a 2022 estimated population of 29,133. It is home to Arkansas Tech University. Arkansas Nuclear One, Arkansas&#x27; only nuclear power plant is nearby. Russellville borders Lake Dardanelle and the Arkansas River.

It is the principal city of the Russellville Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Pope and Yell counties. Under Arkansas Code Title 14, Russellville is a city of the first class.

==History==

===Settlement===
Before the town was named Russellville, its vicinity was known as Chactas Prairie, The Prairie, or Cactus Flats. Located on the southern edge of the Ozark Mountains and north of the Arkansas River, this setting was an ideal settlement area.

Throughout the 18th century into the early 19th century, seasonal movements of the seminomadic Osage Indians from western Missouri brought them annually into Arkansas, including the valley where Russellville is now located. Between 1815 and 1828, the area was within a Cherokee reservation. Under a new treaty concluded on May 6, 1828, the western boundary of Arkansas was established, with seven million acres west of Arkansas in Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) provided to the Cherokees &quot;forever.&quot; The Cherokees agreed to leave the Arkansas lands within 14 months.

The first house in what is now Russellville, a one-and-a-half-story hand-hewn log house, was built by J.C. Holledger in 1834 and purchased the next year by Dr. Thomas Russell. One of the first businesses to be established in the town was a store opened in the 1840s by brothers James Madison and Benjamin &quot;B.D.R.&quot; Shinn. In 1852, with a cash capital of $500, Benjamin&#x27;s son, Jacob Shinn established one of the first general stores—just down the road from the log home of Thomas Russell—in an 18 ft by 24 ft building. Shinn replaced the wood structure store with a masonry structure, a building completed in 1876 and which, still standing today, is known as the Shinn Building. It was built at the junction of an east–west road from Lewisburg to Clarksville and a north–south road between Dover and the military road crossing at Norristown on the Arkansas River. The intersection is now West Main Street and Denver Avenue (formerly River Street). Before the construction of the masonry building, the existing store was moved to the back of Shinn&#x27;s property and, during construction, continued in operation.

====Antebellum period====
According to tradition, in the 1840s, the choice of a name for the community of five homes and a store was between Russellville—for Thomas Russell, who had the first home in the area and was a doctor—and Shinnville—for Jacob L. Shinn who established the community&#x27;s first store. However, Russellville was actually named about 1842 when Jacob was a teen. Russellville is listed on mail routes in requests for proposals for carrying the mail in 1842, when Shinn was 15, and in 1846, when he was 19, so naming the community after Jacob would have been quite unlikely. However, in the 1840s, his uncle, James Madison Shinn, and father, B. D. R. Shinn, operated a store in the small frontier community, so any truth in the naming tradition may apply to them.

A post office was established as early as the early 1840s based on request for mail route proposals and certainly by 1854.

As with the war with Mexico in the 1840s, many men of Russellville served in the state&#x27;s military forces during the American Civil War. Local men served in the state forces early in the war, with many transferring to Confederate regiments by 1862. Several local men were also formed into at least two pro-Union companies. No great battles occurred in or near Russellville, though actions did take place late in the war at nearby Dardanelle (Yell County). While the war came to an official end in 1865, peace did not immediately return to the area. Many areas of Pope County were disrupted in the early 1870s by the turmoil of what came to be known as the Pope County Militia War.

===Reconstruction era===
The town grew slowly, but during the early 1870s the railroad was built and the town exploded commercially and experienced a boom in population. It connected Russellville to other towns in the area, and ran eventually from Ft. Smith to Little Rock, connecting other river valley towns such as Morrilton, Conway, Atkins, London, and facilitating trade among them. Russellville&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Herald&quot;, was founded in 1870. By 1876, the town boasted a population of approximately 800 serviced by fifteen stores, two cotton gins, and six doctors.

===Incorporation as a city===
On June 7, 1870, Russellville became an incorporated city. Incorporation prompted a debate on moving the county seat, located in Dover since 1841, to one of two growing business centers adjacent to the new tracks. An act to move the county seat passed in the General Assembly in 1873 but was repealed during a special session of the General Assembly in 1874. On March 19, 1887, an election was held on whether to move the county seat to Russellville or to Atkins. Russellville was selected by a margin of 128 votes out of 2,670 total votes cast. The question on moving the county seat had also gone to the voters nearly a decade earlier on September 2, 1878, but the results were overturned in the courts.

While formal education came to the Russellville area early with the founding of nearby Dwight Mission in 1820, most early schools were either private or by subscription. The Russellville Public School District was formed in 1870, the year the city was incorporated. By 1876, it had evolved into a nine-month school. By 1890, approximately 400 students attended in ten grades, and in 1893, the first class to attend through twelve grades graduated.

Most 19th-century residents of the area farmed for a living or, with the coming of the railroad, harvested timber. By the end of the century, Russellville and the surrounding area had become a prosperous coal-mining area, with the Ouita Coal Company being the first established. Other coal companies followed with deep mine shafts sunk north and south of town, which, by the 1950s, had given way to strip mining. Cotton became a profitable crop near Russellville; in the early 20th century, bales were sold from wagons in the middle of Main Street. Today, no coal is mined, and the cotton gins are gone.

===20th century===

In 1906 the town suffered a massive fire in its central business district. The fire consumed nearly half of the buildings but they were quickly rebuilt, most within six months after the fire.

What today is Arkansas Tech University (ATU) in Russellville was established in 1910 as the Second District Agricultural school—a four-year high school. The school evolved over the years, adding 2 years of college courses in the 1920s and dropping the high school courses at the end of the 1929–1930 academic year with the school&#x27;s name changed to Arkansas Polytechnic College in 1925. Its name was changed to Arkansas Tech University in 1976.

On February 11, 1930, the Russellville City Council passed an ordinance renaming the city&#x27;s streets. The ordinance established a logical order for street names and went into effect on April 1, 1930.

With America&#x27;s entry into World War II, many Russellville men enlisted or were drafted into the military. Many of the local men served in the 153rd Infantry. Battery D and Battery F of the 206th Coast Artillery Regiment of the Arkansas National Guard were initially stationed at ATU. Many of the men saw service in Alaska in what is known as the Williwaw War.

After the war, the construction of Interstate 40 in 1956 sparked Russelville&#x27;s growth. The highway has been a boon to the area&#x27;s growth, much like the railroad was in the 1870s. A major economic boost came as a result of the completion of a dam near the Arkansas River crossing between Dardanelle and Russellville in 1965. The dam created a lake, which led to the establishment of Lake Dardanelle State Park, a major tourist attraction in the area. The completion of the lock and power dam, a part of the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System, which brings in between $1 and $2 billion in trade to the state each year, has greatly improved the area&#x27;s business prospects.
During the 1970s, the town, like so many other small American towns, witnessed the decentralization of its historic downtown area, due to the advent of large retail outlets such as Wal-Mart. Many of the historic buildings were left to decay or were torn down. Also in the 1970s, Arkansas&#x27; only nuclear power plant, Arkansas Nuclear One, was built just outside the city, on Lake Dardanelle. The plant brought more people and jobs to the city.

<text>DeValls Bluff is a city in and the county seat of the southern district of Prairie County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 619 at the 2010 census.

==History==

Prairie County has always been important to Arkansas for the transportation of people and goods throughout the state. Initially, it was the White River that gave the agricultural county its importance for transport, since waterways were the primary means of long-distance transportation in the period before the development of railroads. Prairie County was cut from Arkansas, Pulaski, Monroe, St. Francis, and White counties in 1846 and included present-day Lonoke County. European settlement in Prairie County came in the 19th century, with Jacob M. DeVall and his son, Chappel, becoming the first recorded settlers around DeValls Bluff according to 1851 tax records.

During the Civil War, the city was a trading center on the White River, which continued to be the primary shipping corridor when the Arkansas River was innavigable. A railroad connection between North Little Rock and DeValls Bluff gave the city further strategic importance. Union forces traveling up the White from Arkansas Post under the command of Brigadier General Willis Gorman captured DeValls Bluff on January 18, 1863. However, the Union forces eventually returned to Arkansas Post, and the city returned to Confederate control. Following the capture of Little Rock, Union cavalry led by Brigadier General John Wynn Davidson joined with gunboats under the command of Lieutenant George Bache in Clarendon on August 9, 1863, and traveled up the White River to capture DeValls Bluff. Major General Frederick Steele proceeded to DeValls Bluff from Helena, and the city was used to house supplies and injured Union soldiers for the remainder of the war.

<text>Des Arc ( ) is a city on the White River in the Arkansas Delta, United States. It is the largest city in Prairie County, Arkansas, and the county seat for the county&#x27;s northern district. Incorporated in 1854, Des Arc&#x27;s position on the river has shaped its culture, history, and economy, beginning as a major lumber shipping port but leaving the city vulnerable to major floods in 1927 and 1937. As river shipping declined, Des Arc was bypassed by railroads, Interstate highways, and much of the post-industrial society. Des Arc&#x27;s history is preserved by seven listings on the National Register of Historic Places, and the region&#x27;s history is interpreted at Lower White River Museum State Park. The city&#x27;s population stopped growing in the 1980s and has been declining since, with a population of 1,717 at the 2010 Census.

==History==
White settlement in the area began in the Lower White River Valley while the area was within French Louisiana, which lasted from 1686-1763. French from Canada and South Louisiana passed through the area while hunting and trapping bears and other animals. They shipped furs and bear oil downriver to Arkansas Post, which was the only established settlement in the region, then likely onto New Orleans. During this period, several places were named by the French, including Des Arc and other places in Prairie County such as La Grue.

Des Arc was founded in 1854. A map shows the original town included 80 residential blocks, and two blocks for a commercial district. The gridded street pattern has never been fully developed, though most of the streets and blocks match the 1854 plan. The gridded east-west street pattern began with a street named McNulty Street in the north, near where present-day Highway 38 is located along the northern edge of the city. The southernmost east-west street was Barrier Street. The town ran from Foster Street (present-day First Street) on the eastern side, to present-day Eighth Street.

==Geography==
Des Arc is located in the Lower White River segment of the Arkansas Delta (in Arkansas, usually referred to as &quot;the Delta&quot;).

<text>Fredonia (Biscoe) is a city in Prairie County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 363 at the 2010 census.

Local myth claimed the town&#x27;s name &quot;Fredonia&quot; was for the Republic of Fredonia movement of Mexican Texas in the 1820s by a group of Arkansas Cherokee people settled near Nacogdoches, Texas. The settlers backed by white Southerners from the U.S. wanted to establish an independent Native nation but the dream ended in an armed conflict by Mexican troops.

&quot;Biscoe&quot; was the town&#x27;s official name for most of its history, being written in parentheses. It was founded in the 1810s by several thousand Cherokee settlers from Tennessee in a piece of land set aside for the Western band of Cherokee, who lost their sovereignty when Arkansas became a state in 1836. The town has an African-American majority from a history of slavery in the antebellum era and agricultural labor afterwards.

<text>Cammack Village is a city in Pulaski County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 778 as of the 2020 census. It is part of the Little Rock–North Little Rock–Conway metropolitan area.

==History==

Cammack Village is located on land originally owned by Wiley Dan Cammack. During the 1930s, Cammack allowed the land to be used for a Works Progress Administration roads project. Sometime before 1943, Cammack attempted to have the land annexed by the city of Little Rock, which lay to the east, but the city demurred, stating the land was &quot;too far west.&quot; Shortly after that, during World War II, Cammack turned the land over to the United States Government to alleviate military housing shortages at Camp Joseph T. Robinson, Little Rock&#x27;s primary Army training base at the time. The houses were laid out in rows and built with per unit, according to U.S. Army specifications for family housing. In order to provide for police and fire protection, Cammack pushed for the incorporation of the new neighborhood, which occurred on April 5, 1943.

Annexation efforts continued beyond Wiley Dan Cammack&#x27;s first attempt. On October 3, 1946, supporters of annexation from both Little Rock and Cammack Village presented a petition for the annexation of Cammack Village to the city of Little Rock to the county clerk of Pulaski County. The petition was approved by the City Council of Little Rock, and the county court ordered that an election be held to determine the will of the voters of both Little Rock and Cammack Village in regard to annexation.

The election was held on November 19, 1946. The returns, as canvassed by the county court, showed that in Little Rock 308 electors voted for the proposed annexation and 112 electors voted against it, and that in Cammack Village 141 electors voted for the annexation and 139 electors voted against it. Because the proposal received a majority of the votes cast in each municipality, on November 26, 1946, Judge L. A. Mashburn issued an order annexing the city.

Following the order, John Coryn, an opponent of annexation, filed suit in the Third Division Circuit Court contesting the election. In his complaint, he alleged that the petition for annexation was improperly filed with the county clerk prior to its presentation to the City Council of Little Rock, that an insufficient number of electors signed this petition, that the officials holding said election were not properly named, and that seven of the 141 persons who voted in favor of said annexation in Cammack Village were not qualified voters. Coryn sought a judgment declaring that the proposal had failed to carry and that the order of annexation was invalid. The court ultimately directed that the cause be put in abeyance to allow proponents of the annexation the opportunity to file a writ of prohibition, which they did on February 10, 1947. See &quot;Russell v. Cockrill&quot;, 199 S.W.2d 584 (Ark. 1947). This writ, however, was ultimately denied, and Coryn and other opponents of the annexation prevailed.

Cammack Village is an enclave as it is completely surrounded by the City of Little Rock. Cammack Village relies upon Little Rock for its water, sewer, power services, and fire protection services. As of January 1, 2014, BFI Waste Services, LLC provides sanitation services for the city. Cammack Village maintains a police force of one to three officers.

The Pulaski County SSD established a school in College Station. From 1949 to 1963, Otis Lee Walker was the principal of the school, which was central to the community of College Station. It was originally a single-room white frame building located in the main red-dirt road called Route 2 in Pulaski County. Route 2 is now known as Frazier Pike. Initially the school provided K-8 education, but during the 50s the higher grades of 7 and above were switched to Sweet Home, under the principalship of David Lyons who worked collaboratively with Otis Walker. Two additional frame buildings were added to the original location of the school providing for a cafeteria to accommodate school lunches and a space for school programs. A major fire of unknown origins destroyed much of the school during the late 1950s. The new facility was constructed at the current school location of 4710 Frazier Pike, Little Rock, Arkansas.

Shortly after court-mandated integration in the late 1960s, the black residents of College Station established a &quot;boycott school&quot; known as the Freedom School in protest of a busing plan. This school had an enrollment of 300, but existed for only two weeks.

== Education ==
Since 1927, Jacksonville had been part of the Pulaski County Special School District, one of the largest school districts in Arkansas. In the years leading up to September 2008, parts of the Jacksonville community expressed a desire to split from the PCSSD. This measure was approved by the board of the PCSSD during that month, clearing the way, legally, for the formation of what would become Jacksonville North Pulaski School District.

In a response to a petition signed by more than 2,000 voters, the Arkansas Board of Education ordered an election to carve a new school district out of the existing Pulaski County Special School District. Jacksonville voters approved of the separation on September 16, 2014, with a vote of 3,672 for and 202 against (95% to 5%).

According to JNPSD officials, the district would be administered by the Pulaski County Special School District until its final detachment, which became effective July 1, 2016.

The district consists of six elementary schools, one middle school and one high school. The schools include Jacksonville High School, Jacksonville Middle School, Bayou Meto Elementary, Bobby G Lester Elementary, Jacksonville Elementary School, and Murrell Taylor Elementary.

Arkansas State University-Beebe maintains a degree center at Little Rock Air Force Base for post-secondary education.

<text>North Little Rock (often abbreviated &quot;NLR&quot;) is a city in Pulaski County, Arkansas, United States. Located on the north side of the Arkansas River, it is the twin city of Little Rock. In the late nineteenth century, it was annexed by Little Rock for a period, but regained its independence in the early 20th century. The population was 64,591 at the 2020 Census, making it the seventh-most populous city in Arkansas.

The city has invested in significant beautification efforts since the late 20th century. Young families and professionals have shown new interest in this area. The Argenta Historic District in Downtown is one of a number of areas that have developed as thriving entertainment districts offering theaters, fine dining, bars, gastropubs, and boutiques. 

It is also home to Dickey-Stephens Park, which hosts the Arkansas Travelers minor league baseball team. Simmons Bank Arena is the metropolitan area&#x27;s main entertainment venue. Farther west is Burns Park, one of the largest municipal parks in the United States.

==History==
Originally named Argenta, Arkansas, the community was founded on April 18, 1871. In 1890, the city of Little Rock annexed Argenta as part of its eighth ward, preempting a competing petition to incorporate. 

As part of a plan to reclaim its independence, Argenta was incorporated on July 17, 1901, as the town of &quot;North Little Rock&quot;. By 1904, the state&#x27;s supreme court allowed North Little Rock to annex what was left of the ward. It readopted the name Argenta in 1906, only to revert to North Little Rock in October 1917. Evidence of the old town can still be found in the North Little Rock City Hall (built in 1914) which contains plaques referring to Argenta, and incorporates &quot;C of A&quot; (i.e. City of Argenta) ornamental features.

== Notable events ==

===North Hills Country Club controversy===
The city was involved in a lawsuit over the development of North Hills Golf Course and Country Club, in the southern end of the city adjoining North Little Rock. A court date was scheduled in April 2008. Mayor Virginia Hillman repeatedly stated during her campaign for mayor for the special election that her plans were to put the issue to a vote for the citizens. A petition was circulated to hold an election on the issue, but the Sherwood City Council voted to go ahead with the acquisition despite Mayor Hillman&#x27;s objections. The issue was last discussed at the Sherwood city council meeting at 7:00 P.M. on Monday, September 24, 2007. A re-zoning sign was placed on the North Hills property the week before Christmas of that year.

On July 21, 2008, the Sherwood City Council approved an ordinance authorizing the settlement of all litigated claims related to the property and structures commonly referred to as North Hill Country Club, which allowed the City of Sherwood to purchase of this property. Since the spring of 2010, the city operates the property as &quot;The Greens at North Hills Municipal Golf Course&quot;.

On July 28, 2010, the originally named &quot;Sylvan Hills Country Club Golf Course&quot; constructed in 1927 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

=== 2009 Theft of City Funds ===

In July 2009, after city officials were notified by Eagle Bank in December 2008, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began investigating the theft of $219,913 in municipal funds. These funds were taken from the city&#x27;s checking account through an unauthorized online electronic transfer. This was the first time the city had experienced unauthorized accessing the city&#x27;s checking account via the internet. In response, city officials analyzed city&#x27;s security system to its financial network and additional safeguards and protections were implemented.

=== Debtor&#x27;s Prison === 
Nikki Petree was released on August 25, 2016, after spending 35 days in county jail for bouncing a $28.93 check five years ago. Judge Milas Hale, who is accused of running a modern-day debtors&#x27; prison in Sherwood, Ark., sentenced the mother to jail; the Huffington Post reports Petree has been arrested seven times in connection with that charge and paid at least $640 to the city for the charge. She told the Post she still owes the city $1,300.

&quot;Every time [I’d] go to jail, they’d let me out immediately for $100,” Petree said in an interview. “They’d turn around and add $600 or $700 more to my bond. I couldn&#x27;t afford to pay. They cornered me, and there was no way out from underneath it. I felt overwhelmed and hopeless.

Petree said prior to her sentencing, Judge Hale asked Petree how much money she could pay today. The judge and the city are facing a federal lawsuit over their alleged practice of unconstitutionally jailing defendants who are unable to pay court fines, fees, and costs.

<text>Woodson is a census-designated place (CDP) in Pulaski County, Arkansas, United States. Its population was 403 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Little Rock–North Little Rock–Conway Metropolitan Statistical Area. Woodson and its accompanying Woodson Lake and Wood Hollow are the namesake for Ed Wood Sr., a prominent plantation owner, trader, and businessman at the turn of the 20th century. Woodson is adjacent to the Wood Plantation, the largest of the plantations own by Ed Wood Sr.

==History==
Ed Wood, Sr. founded a settlement in central Arkansas after migrating from Alabama with his mother &quot;circa&quot; 1880. What is now called Woodson was known for much of the area&#x27;s early history as &quot;Wood Hollow&quot; in recognition of Ed Wood Sr. and his 1890 purchase of the first black-owned plantation in Arkansas.

In the period following Radical Reconstruction, Ed Wood, Sr. began hosting gathering of the Prince Hall Freemasonry, of which he was a founding member of the Arkansas Lodge and held rank of highest degree. It was in these meetings at the Wood Plantation that he became an associated with Scipio Africanus Jones, John E. Bush, Chester W. Keatts, and John Hamilton McConico. From these meetings, a vibrant African-American Establishment matured. Wood was able to sustain the Prince Hall Lodge, but his contemporaries spun off to form the Mosaic Templars of America.

<text>Maynard is a town in Randolph County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 379 at the 2020 census.

Maynard is home to the Maynard Pioneer Museum and Park. A jail built in 1936 has a door made of wagon wheel rims. The last time it was used was in 1988, when it temporarily housed a man charged with public intoxication. The jail is beside Maynard Community Center.

==History==
Maynard was settled in the late 19th century. John Maynard, formerly a captain in the Confederate Army, spent some time in Texas before moving to Arkansas in 1872, where he opened a dry goods store, and farmed 900 acres, mostly cotton. Other families and businessmen joined him in the village they called New Prospect. When they applied for a post office in 1885 that name was rejected and the office was named ‘Maynard.’ The town incorporated as Maynard in 1895.

Abbott Institute — later known as Maynard Baptist Academy and Ouachita Baptist Academy — was a boarding school established in 1894. Abbott Institute joined a school network associated with a college now known as Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia.

In 1928, Maynard Baptist Academy was sold to the Maynard School District. Its facilities were then used by the public school. All that remains of the academy today is an arch built by Maynard Baptist Academy&#x27;s class of 1927, its last class. In 2008, Maynard School Alumni Association restored the arch on the school grounds as a memorial to the academy.

In 1962 Delaplaine Elementary School took responsibility for elementary education as the O&#x27;Kean Elementary School was shuttered. Therefore when the Delaplaine district was in operation, students attended Delaplaine Elementary and Delaplaine High School. On July 1, 2004, the Delaplaine district merged into the Greene County Tech School District. In 2007 the Greene County district closed Delaplaine Schools and redirected O&#x27;Kean students to the campuses in Paragould.

<text>Pocahontas is a city in the county seat of Randolph County, Arkansas, United States, along the Black River. According to the 2010 Census Bureau, the population of the city was 6,608.

Pocahontas has a number of historic buildings, including the Old Randolph County Courthouse built in 1871, the St. Mary&#x27;s AME Church, and the Pocahontas Colored School built in 1918, the latter of which is now home to the Eddie Mae Herron Center.

==History==

This city was named after the Native American from Jamestown, Virginia. A statue of her is located in Overlook Park along the Black River.

The family of Dr. Ransom S. Bettis is given the credit for being the first settlers on the land now called Pocahontas. Dr. Bettis&#x27; daughter, Cinderella, married Thomas S. Drew, and lived on 800 acres where the town of Biggers now exists. Bettis and Drew led the founding of Pocahontas as the county seat of Randolph County.

Randolph County is famous for many &quot;firsts&quot;; Arkansas&#x27; oldest town, Davidsonville, was established in 1815. The first Arkansas post office was built in Davidsonville in 1817, and the first state courthouse was established in 1818. The earliest land claim was in 1809 near what is now Ravenden Springs. The first actual term of court convened in Arkansas was in 1815 in a part of Lawrence County that was given over to Randolph County. And the country&#x27;s first overland route, the Natchitoches Trail (Natchitoches Trace), went through parts of Randolph County.

In 1835, the Territorial Legislature granted the formation of Randolph County from part of the area then called Lawrence County. The county was named after John Randolph, who was one of the first settlers in the area.

Randolph County encompasses the rolling hills of the Ozarks to the west and rich, flat farmland of the Mississippi Delta to the east. Five rivers flow through the county, providing access to fishing and canoeing. Soybeans, rice, and other grains are the principal crops in the Delta region, while cattle ranching dominates the hill country. The poultry industry is also a vital part of the area economy.

During the early part of the Civil War, Camp Shaver, located in Pocahontas, was the headquarters for Confederate forces west of the Mississippi River.

The industrial base is diversified, with products such as shoes, large truck trailers, technical components for communications, picture frames, golf bags and luggage, tool boxes, wood products and more.

Pocahontas is the county seat with a population of 6,616. The other 10,407 residents of Randolph County live in rural areas and five incorporated communities - Maynard, Biggers, Reyno, Ravenden Springs and O&#x27;Kean.

Local legend holds that Pocahontas was named the county seat through an act of trickery. Supposedly, at the county meeting to determine which city would receive the title, the delegation from Pocahontas brought in large quantities of alcohol and distributed them to the other delegations. When the time came to vote, the only delegation not passed out or otherwise influenced was that from Pocahontas.

<text>Bauxite is a city in Saline County, Arkansas, United States. Located within Central Arkansas, the city is named for bauxite, the source ore for aluminum, which was found in abundant quantities in the area and became a source of aluminium refining. The city&#x27;s population boomed during expanded aluminium production during World War II and shrank rapidly with output of the ore. Bauxite was incorporated as a town in 1973. The population was 487 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The ore for which the city is named was discovered in the area in the early 1890s and mined by the General Bauxite Company until 1905, when the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, an aluminum refining company, purchased vast tracts of land in Saline County after learning of the high-quality ore that was being shipped from the area. The company bought out the local producers of the ore, including the General Bauxite Company. Pittsburgh Reduction would go on to incorporate as the Aluminum Company of America, or ALCOA.

Production of the ore rose rapidly, growing from in 1914 during World War I, to by war&#x27;s end in 1918. With decreased demand and an expanded source base in South America, Arkansas production levels fluctuated with demand, dropping as low as per annum in the mid-1930s.

World War I provided the greatest surge in growth for Bauxite, with multiple camps developing in and around the present-day city, often segregated by race or ethnicity, with such camp names as Italy Camp, Mexico Camp, Africa Camp, etc. Throughout the Great Depression, ALCOA provided a standard of living for its employees that was generally un-matched during that period of economic turbulence.

When World War II broke out, Bauxite was again called into martial action, with production rapidly increasing with the need for refined aluminum to produce airplanes and other material. Donald M. Nelson, the Chairman of the WPA, requested that ALCOA president, Arthur V. Davis implement a three-shift, 24-hour production schedule. Davis brought in miners from across the country to keep the mines running continuously. This rapid rise in output led to a 1943 annual production of of ore.

Production began to slow as the war drew to a close, but the city&#x27;s population and infrastructure had swelled to include multiple new communities and a larger school district. ALCOA and Reynolds Metal Company continued to refine bauxite in the area, with Reynolds finally ceasing operations in 1981.

==Geography==
Bauxite is located in Saline County in south central Arkansas. Situated along Arkansas Highway 183 which also runs through Benton and Bryant, Bauxite is bordered on that path by Benton to the west and Bryant to the north. The city is 14 miles southwest of Little Rock. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (2.45%) is water.

==Arts and culture==

In 1926, ALCOA built a community center in traditional Colonial style to serve as a boarding house and gathering place for the mining community in the town. The structure still stands, and houses the Bauxite Museum, an informal collection of photographs, documents, and mining equipment from the mining era. In 2008, the museum erected &quot;Unsung Heroes,&quot; a life-size series of bronze statues sculpted by Gary Alsum at the property&#x27;s corner. The sculptures depict a traditional mining family, with a man preparing to leave for work at the bauxite mines. The community center is available to the general public for rental and event usage.

As with many cities and towns in Arkansas, football is important in the Bauxite community as both a social event and source of pride for the city&#x27;s identity. Bauxite High School has a storied football program which began around 1920. The Bauxite Miners football team won 24 conference championships, appeared in two state title games and won the state championship in 1996. Bauxite has produced many standout players throughout its history. George Cole, (1920-1923) who went on to coach and become athletic director at the University of Arkansas, and Leon &quot;Muscles&quot; Campbell (1943-1945) who played for the NFL&#x27;s Baltimore Colts, Chicago Bears, and Pittsburgh Steelers, both played at Bauxite.

In recent history, head football coach Jon Watson led the Miners for nearly two decades before retiring in 2010. During his coaching career with Bauxite, which lasted from 1990 until his retirement, he compiled a 177-55-1 record. Watson now ranks seventh overall in victories for high school football coaches in Arkansas.
The program currently plays in the 7-4A conference of the Arkansas Activities Association.

==Government==

Bauxite operates under a city council system with a mayor as the presiding executive officer. The current (as of April 6, 2021) mayor is Eddie Jones. Other elected officials include treasurer Renee Chastain, and council members Ron Parsons, John Davis, Ron Ramsey, Deann Watson, and John Simpson.

==Politics==
As a part of rural Saline County and a bedroom community to Little Rock, Bauxite has an often convoluted political dynamic. Previously represented by Democratic State Senator Shane Broadway and Representative Dawn Creekmoore, in the 2010 election cycle, Bauxite&#x27;s representation switched to all-Republican with the election of former State Representative Jeremy Hutchinson and Andy Mayberry to the State Senate and House, respectively. In the Bauxite city precinct, Creekmore narrowly lost to Hutchinson 51%-49%, while Mayberry beat his Democratic challenger by a 76% to 24% margin. Democrats Governor Mike Beebe (who was running for re-election) and Broadway, who was running for Lieutenant Governor of the state, each won by at least 20 percentage points in the city during the 2010 election.

===Legislative Delegation===
==Education==
Bauxite has three public schools, which belong to the Bauxite School District, an independent school district which was subject to consolidation under Governor Mike Huckabee&#x27;s school consolidation plan, but managed to maintain its autonomy after a public outcry from the community. The school district consists of:
* Pine Haven Elementary, located in the old Pine Haven community established during World War II
* Bauxite Middle School
* Bauxite High School, built in 2001, replacing a Depression-era Works Progress Administration-built school that was destroyed by fire in January of that year

A small portion of the city is in the Bryant School District, which operates Bryant High School.

==Notable people==
*George W. Bond, president of Louisiana Tech University from 1928 to 1936.
* Leon Campbell, star fullback at the University of Arkansas
* George Cole, University of Arkansas head football coach
* Susan Dunn, Grammy Award-winning operatic soprano
* Robert M. Utley, author and historian

<text>Gilbert is a town in Searcy County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 26 at the 2020 census, ranking it as the smallest municipality in the state and one of the smallest in the nation. Over the years, Gilbert has gained a reputation (along with Calico Rock) as one of the coldest locations in Arkansas.

==History==
The Gilbert community was founded in 1902 when a railroad construction camp for the Missouri and North Arkansas (M&amp;NA) Railroad was built and named in honor of Charles W. Gilbert, secretary-treasurer of Allegheny Supply Company, which was building the railroad. The M&amp;NA began at Seligman, Missouri and rambled for 303 tortuous miles to Helena, Arkansas on the Mississippi River. In 1906, William Mays moved his store and post office to Gilbert. The Gilbert General Store, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places under the name Mays Store.

During the early 1920s, Reverend John Battenfield and his followers migrated into Gilbert and aspired to create a self-sufficient community to survive the return of the Messiah. They built a church and erected a sturdy building of smooth brown stones that was the print shop for their weekly newspaper, the &quot;Kingdom Harbinger&quot;. Gilbert Cemetery, for those who didn&#x27;t make it for the anticipated Rapture, was founded in 1920 at the top of the hill on Frost Street. Gilbert School District Eighty-eight was formed in 1921. Eli Jordan donated the land for a school, the residents donated money for lumber and materials, anyone with a team and wagon hauled in the lumber, and the men of Gilbert built the school. As the town grew, it boasted four stores, two hotels, an Eagle Pencil Company mill, several sawmills and three doctors. 1923 passed without the appearance of the Messiah, and in 1925 Reverend Battenfield and his family left Gilbert to look for another location.

In the 1930s Gilbert had 116 people, its highest ever population count.

Gilbert remained a hub for commerce for several years. Cotton, logs, ore and grain came by rail. By the 1940s, unsustainable logging practices led to a decline in logging activity. The railroad suffered. The railroad tracks were soon removed and sold as scrap. Concrete pylons stand as evidence of the railroad.

In 2022 the community phased out its use of traditional street lights for light-emitting diode (LED) lights using high-pressure sodium. This is an anti-light pollution measure.

==History==

In 1819, Arkansas was separated from Missouri, but was still included in what is now Oklahoma. The two states were separated and Arkansas admitted to the Union in 1836, just two years before Autumn Tøpanga Leslie&#x27;s arrival. The Indians were peaceful and cooperative in Wiley&#x27;s Cove. There were two Indian chiefs in Samuel Leslie&#x27;s time: one called Wiley and the other Al. The Leslie area was called Wiley&#x27;s Cove after Chief Wiley, and Al&#x27;s Cove was in the Rumley area. Samuel built a small house on land in which he lived temporarily while the Indians moved aside, and then he built a two-story southern type home with a separate kitchen and slave quarters. This house was located where the Legion Hut now stands; the well at the north corner of the hut was the original well for the Samuel Leslie homestead. He also owned a store and trading post nearby. It is said he gave away some of the land to encourage other settlers to come into the community. The name Wiley&#x27;s Cove was changed to Leslie by the Postal Department on November 9, 1887. Andrew Jackson Leslie requested the name to be changed in honor of his father, Samuel Leslie.

==Education==
Leslie is served by the Searcy County School District. The zoned schools are Marshall ABC Preschool, Marshall Elementary School, Leslie Intermediate School, and Marshall High School.

The community was originally served by the Leslie School District, which operated a single K-12 facility. On July 1, 2004, the Leslie district and the Marshall School District consolidated to form the Searcy County School District, with the Marshall district annexing Leslie. This was done because the Leslie district had fewer than 350 students and an Arkansas law passed in 2004 required school districts to have at least 350 students. Leslie High School closed in 2007, and high school students moved to Marshall HS. Originally a PreK-6 school named Leslie Elementary School, the remaining school in Leslie was reconfigured in 2012 as a 5-6 school named Leslie Intermediate School now serving the entire Searcy County district, and it was reconfigured as 4–6 in 2014. In 2012 Marshall Elementary School in Marshall was reconfigured as a lower elementary school serving the whole district.

<text>Marshall is the largest city in and county seat of Searcy County in Arkansas, United States. It is located in the Ozarks at the foot of the Boston Mountain Range south of America&#x27;s first National River, the Buffalo National River. Marshall serves as a hub for area tourism including camping, floating, hiking, bicycling and Dark Sky viewing.

==History==

=== Early history ===
The Paleo Indians, were the earliest known human inhabitants of the area. They marked their stay by leaving behind their unique Clovis spear points in caves and fields. Later, they became more advanced in creating shelters, clothing, and hunting weapons. In 1968 Don Dickson discovered lighter “heat treated” flint points at Calf Creek near Snowball.  As a result of this first discovery all similar type projectiles are called Calf Creek Points.

A year after the Louisiana Purchase, Congress began efforts to remove all tribes west of the Mississippi.  By 1810, at the urging of the Secretary of War, large groups of Cherokees voluntarily moved to Arkansas and immediately found themselves fighting with the Osage who claimed this area as their hunting grounds. The 1817 Treaty of the Cherokee Agency created a designated area in Northwest Arkansas and it became the first  Cherokee Reservation west of the Mississippi. To help with the conflict with the Osage the Cherokees invited the Shawnee to settle in the area of the Buffalo River.

A Shawnee Village was established southwest of Marshall and was most likely Chief Peter Cornstalk&#x27;s village. (He was the Grandson, and name sake, of the great Chief of the Shawnee Nation during the American Revolutionary War.) In the 1830s Chief Cornstalk married Mary Adams, grand daughter of Robert Adams, a business partner of Indian Agent, Pierre Menard. Mary&#x27;s family was one of the first white settlers in the area.

By the 1840s, all tribes were removed to Indian Territory.

The first settlement here was at this location on a bench at the foot of the Devils Backbone Mountain at Raccoon Springs. In 1856, the county seat was moved from Lebanon to this site, and it was named Burrowville (sometimes spelled Burrowsville) after Napoleon Bonaparte Burrow, a Crawford County planter and politician.

=== Civil War ===
The Civil War was a significant transitional event for Marshall. It changed the name of the town, retarded its growth for years, and established a vibrant two-party political system in what was for many years a one-party state. It also caused desolation—much of Burrowville/Marshall was burned, including the courthouse and county records. On November 17, 1861, the Arkansas Confederate authorities discovered a secret pro-Union Peace Society in north-central Arkansas and tried to arrest all members. The captured Peace Society members were guarded in the courthouse. On December 9, 1861, seventy-seven prisoners were sent to Little Rock where they were encouraged to join the Confederate army. After the war, the political situation was still so volatile that U.S. troops were stationed in Burrowville for a few months to keep peace. County Unionists pushed to change the town&#x27;s name to Marshall after U.S. Chief Justice John Marshall, and the legislature approved the change on March 18, 1867.

=== Early 1900s ===
The discovery of lead and zinc ore in north central Arkansas along with the arrival of the Missouri and North Arkansas Railroad brought a brief boom period time to Marshall. During the early 1900s with the help of mining and timber Marshall grew and prospered. After World War I, a complex series of events combined to undermine the previous decades growth.  By the 1929 stock market crash the region was experiencing severe economic hardships.

=== Post World War II ===
Following World War II Marshall was the primary trade center for service and retail for most of Searcy County serving as the hub for the timber, cattle, and other agricultural industries. In the 1950s strawberries became a major product for the area. During this time Marshall proclaimed itself as the “Strawberry Capital of the World”.

By the late 1960s the commercial strawberry industry was moving to California and Texas, general retail was being captured by national companies like Wal-Mart, and improved highway systems allowed people to travel to larger towns for all goods and services. These factors combined with others caused the beginning of a fundamental change in the Marshall economy.

Public computers are available for research, job searches etc., and Wi-Fi is available. The Genealogy Dept. is an LDS Affiliate Library with 5,000+ historical pictures of people and places as well as 2,400 historical records. There are also books, maps and microfilm available for research. There is a Genealogy Facebook page that has reached almost 23,000 people.

<text>St. Joe or Saint Joe is a town in Searcy County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 132 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==Major highway==
* U.S. Highway 65

==History==
The town of St. Joe, Arkansas, was founded a few miles north of the Buffalo River around 1860 by Bill Campbell, Ben Henley Sr., Dr. George Turney, Captain Harry Love, Decatur Robinson, and Matt Tyson. Mill Creek, near the current post office on U.S. Highway 65, was the original town location. Wagon trains traveled from the town to Springfield, Missouri, where produce was sold and goods were purchased and brought back to the stores. The History and Folklore of Searcy County Arkansas states that St. Joe was originally called Monkey Run. The area came by its current name around 1900, when six miners from St. Joseph, Missouri, received the largest quantity of mail to come into the post office. The outpost eventually became known as St. Joe, Arkansas. Mines, and rumors of mines, feature largely in the story of St. Joe&#x27;s past. It is worth noting that one of the nearby settlements is named Silver Hill. According to one fable, there is a “Lost Silver Mine” that was reputed to be fabulously rich in the late 1800s, believed to be located somewhere between Calf Creek and Bear Creek and worked by an Indian named Woodward. A news article in the Marshall Mountain Wave, printed Friday, May 30, 1924, stated that the lost silver mine had been found by a girl searching for a lost cow. The opening, covered by vegetation, was in a gulch. The silver and mining equipment was claimed to have been found, sitting for 75 years in the mine.

Historian James Johnson claims that the Lost Silver Mine does not exist, despite many stories. He says that there was an “Indian Woodard” whose descendants still live in Arkansas, but that most of the remaining legend is untrue.

The railroad arrived in St. Joe in 1902 and operated until 1946. Mined ores were shipped from St. Joe via the Missouri and North Arkansas Railroad, whose depot, faithfully restored to its early 20th-century appearance, sits on U.S. Highway 65 in the middle of the present town of St. Joe. The St. Joe Lime and Crushed Rock Company flourished with the mining boom, operating in a quarry just west of town. It is said that St. Joe set the standard for lime and crushed limestone throughout the world at this time. Johnson says that St. Joe&#x27;s heyday was during World War I with the mines.

It was during this period that the Henley Hotel, still standing to the north of Highway 65 across from the Depot, was built around 1914. St. Joe&#x27;s population was about 2,300 people from 1917 to 1921. The town boasted four stores, two hotels, a blacksmith, bank, mills, cafes, and post office. 
The first school was an 18’ x 18’ log building that was also the church and lodge hall. There was a grist mill and several physicians. The railroad&#x27;s arrival and Highway 65 being paved caused many businesses to relocate to highway frontage, what is now called “new town” by old-time residents. The Citizens’ Bank was in business from 1913 to 1933.

After World War I the price of zinc dropped and it was no longer economically feasible to continue mining. The railroad to some extent depended upon the mines, and when mining stopped, this hurt the railroad. The town continued as a local outlet for produce, cattle, cotton, and timber, but population and industry gradually diminished, and the railroad pulled out in 1946.

==Present day==
In time, the town dropped its incorporation. In the late 1990s, there was renewed interest in having an incorporated town. People wanted to have a local government again in order to have local direction of what happened in their lives. Because of a state law requiring a minimum of 175 registered voters in order to incorporate, a new incorporation could not be done. Instead, the charter for what was called the &quot;Old Town&quot; was reactivated.

Since the modern incorporation (or reactivation), people on the edge of the town have asked to be included. The town has grown by over 100 acres.

Today, the 1920s era buildings, ghostly remnants of a more prosperous past, sit mostly abandoned, interspersed with a gas station, a post office, and the St. Joe school. On the outskirts are a couple of motels and eateries, which cater to tourist traffic.

While no longer a hub for farming and mining in the region, the town sees in itself an important part of the history of the Ozarks and a gateway to some of the most popular recreational areas on the Buffalo River. The revitalization of the town&#x27;s pioneering spirit is evident in the restoration of its historic buildings and the creation of the Rural Help Center as a hub of community education and services.

==Recent developments==

In early 2011, the town received a grant of just over $10,000 from the Arkansas Rural Community Grant Program. The grant requires that the amount be matched locally. Volunteer hours can contribute to the match. One of the plans for the money is to refurbish the historic Missouri and North Arkansas Railroad depot in St. Joe.

In mid-2012 St. Joe launched a website featuring the town and surrounding communities. The website focuses on the history and natural assets of the area including the Buffalo River.

St. Joe is one of thirteen communities participating in Ozark Byways which promotes small towns in the north central Arkansas region.

In October 2012 the Searcy County Rural Help Center was launched in St. Joe. The nonprofit organization is staffed by volunteers and makes computers, internet, and training available to community members. The North Arkansas Career Center teaches night classes for adults working toward their GED. A Kids Corner is open on Saturdays.

== Education ==
St. Joe is in the Ozark Mountain School District. The district operates St. Joe Elementary School and Ozark Mountain High School. The latter is located in the former Western Grove High School, which consolidated into Ozark Mountain High in 2023.

On July 1, 2004, the former St. Joe School District consolidated into the Ozark Mountain School District. The consolidated district operated St. Joe High School, on a K-12 campus in the town of St. Joe, until 2023, when it consolidated into Ozark Mountain High School.

<text>Bonanza is a city in Sebastian County, Arkansas, United States. It is part of the Fort Smith, Arkansas-Oklahoma Metropolitan Statistical Area. At the 2010 Census, the population of Bonanza was 575. According to the 2018 US Census Bureau estimates, the population of Bonanza was 564. Bonanza began as a coal mining town of the Central Coal and Coke Company.

==History== 
On October 10, 1851, Sebastian County was created from parts of Arkansas&#x27; Crawford, Polk, and Scott counties, placing Bonanza within the boundaries. Coal was discovered near the Arkansas-Oklahoma line about 12 miles southeast of Fort Smith, Arkansas. In 1896, the Central Coal and Coke Company developed railroads in the area as part of the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway, structuring Bonanza into a company town. Mine No. 10 did not yield sufficient results, but Mine No. 12 soon had 144 workers. Mine No. 20 employed 185 workers, and Mine No. 26 employed 76 workers. When workers and their families reached a sizable number, C.C. Woodson filed a petition to incorporate, and on November 26, 1898, the town was chartered.

===Bonanza Race War===

On April 27, 1904, around 200 residents congregated west of Bonanza to decide on and ultimately pass a resolution &quot;demanding that about forty negroes employed by Central Coal and Coke Company leave town&quot;, which, if necessary, would be administered by force. The United Mine Workers of America responded to rumors alleging its involvement as &quot;false and unfounded&quot; while pledging to protect its Black workers.

On April 30, a gun battle between Black and white customers at a saloon escalated into a violent conflict consisting of armed white mobs directing gunfire into the homes of Black residents. According to the &quot;Fort Smith Times&quot;, &quot;as many as 500 shots were fired during the night.&quot; On May 7, the &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot; reported, &quot;No one wounded during the fusillade, but Negroes were terrorized and decided to leave&quot;, adding that &quot;nearly all black residents had left the city&quot; by that time. Bonanza residents&#x27; forceful expulsion of Black people through terror has led to the location being described as a sundown town by the Central Arkansas Library System&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of Arkansas&quot;.

<text>Fort Smith is the third-most populous city in Arkansas, United States, and one of the two county seats of Sebastian County. As of the 2020 census, the population was 89,142. It is the principal city of the Fort Smith, Arkansas–Oklahoma Metropolitan Statistical Area, a region of 298,592 residents that encompasses the Arkansas counties of Crawford, Franklin, and Sebastian, and the Oklahoma counties of LeFlore and Sequoyah.

Fort Smith lies on the Arkansas–Oklahoma state border, situated at the confluence of the Arkansas and Poteau rivers, also known as Belle Point. Fort Smith was established as a western frontier military post in 1817, when it was also a center of fur trading. The city developed there. It became well known as a base for migrants&#x27; settling of the &quot;Wild West&quot; and for its law enforcement heritage, as it was the hub for white law enforcement of the adjacent Indian Territory.

The city government is led by Mayor George McGill (D), who in 2018 was elected as the city&#x27;s mayor (the first African American in its history), and a city Board of Directors composed of three members elected at-large and four members elected by ward.

==History==
The United States acquired the territory and large areas west of the Mississippi River from France in the Louisiana Purchase (1803). Soon after, the government sent the Pike Expedition (1806) to explore the areas along the Arkansas River. The U.S. founded Fort Smith in 1817 as a military post. It was named after General Thomas Adams Smith (1781–1844), who commanded the United States Army Rifle Regiment in 1817, headquartered near St. Louis. General Smith had ordered Army topographical engineer Stephen H. Long (1784–1864) to find a suitable site on the Arkansas River for a fort. General Smith never visited the town or the forts that bore his name.

A stockade was built and occupied from 1817 until 1822 by a small troop of regulars commanded by Major William Bradford. A small settlement began forming around the fort, but the Army abandoned the first Fort Smith in 1824 and moved 80 miles further west to Fort Gibson. John Rogers, an Army sutler and land speculator, bought up former government-owned lands at this site and promoted growth of the new civilian town of Fort Smith.

Due to the strategic location of this site, the federal government re-established a military presence at Fort Smith during the Indian removal era of the 1830s, primarily of tribes from the American Southeast to west of the Mississippi River in Indian Territory, which is present-day Oklahoma.

In 1838, the Army moved back into the old military post near Belle Point, and expanded the base. They used troops to forcibly relocate the Choctaw and Cherokee, from their ancestral homelands in the Southeast; they were the last of the tribes to leave. Remnants of the Five Civilized Tribes remained in the southeast, and some of their descendants have reorganized and been federally recognized. The Cherokee called the forced migration the Trail of Tears, as some of their people and the people who were enslaved died from starvation, hypothermia, exhaustion and many illnesses along the way. The army enforced the removal of these tribes to the reserved Indian Territory, where the federal government set aside land that was less fertile while imposing detentes between distinct nations. Many displaced people stopped walking and settled in Fort Smith and adjoining Van Buren on the other side of the river.

The U.S. Army also used Fort Smith as a base during the Mexican–American War (1846-1848). As a result, the U.S. acquired large territories in the Southwest, and later annexed the Republic of Texas, which had been independent from 1836-1846.

Sebastian County was formed in 1851, separated from Crawford County north of the Arkansas River. In 1858, Fort Smith was designated as a Division Center of the Butterfield Overland Mail&#x27;s 7th Division route across Indian Territory from Fort Smith to Texas and as a junction with the mail route from Memphis, Tennessee, an important port on the east side of the Mississippi River.

For roughly a year of the American Civil War, the fort was occupied by the Confederate States Army. Union troops under General Frederick Steele took control of Fort Smith on September 1, 1863. A small fight occurred there on July 31, 1864, but the Union Army maintained command in the area until the war ended in 1865. As a result, many refugee slaves, orphans, Southern Unionists, and others came here to escape the guerrilla warfare raging in Arkansas, Missouri, and the border states. The slaves were freed under the Emancipation Proclamation of January 1863 by President Abraham Lincoln. Federal troops abandoned the post of Fort Smith for the last time in 1871. The town continued to thrive despite the absence of federal troops.

Two of Fort Smith&#x27;s most notable historic figures were Judge Isaac C. Parker and William Henry Harrison Clayton, also known as W. H. H. Clayton. In 1874, William Clayton was appointed United States Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas by President Ulysses S. Grant. Fort Smith was a bustling community full of brothels, saloons, and outlaws, just across the river from Indian Territory. William Clayton realized a strong judge would be necessary to bring law and order to the region. He knew that Parker was a strong judge. But Parker had been appointed Chief Justice of Utah Territory and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. With the help of President Grant and U.S. Senator Powell Clayton, former governor of Arkansas, William Clayton was able to gain the appointment of Parker in the Fort Smith district. At that time, the Fort Smith district not only held the responsibility for law in Western Arkansas, but also the Indian Territory.

Judge Parker served as U.S. District Judge 1875–1896. He was nicknamed the &quot;Hanging Judge&quot;: in his first term after assuming his post, he tried 18 people for murder, convicted 15 of them, and sentenced eight of those to die. Six of these men were later hanged on the same day. Over the course of his career in Fort Smith, Parker sentenced 160 people to death. Of those, 79 were executed on the gallows. His courthouse is now marked as a National Historic Site, where &quot;more men were put to death by the U.S. Government... than in any other place in American history.&quot; Parker was assisted in his law enforcement efforts by famed African-American marshal Bass Reeves.

William Clayton served as U.S. Attorney under four different presidents and later was appointed as Chief Justice of Indian Territory. He was instrumental in achieving statehood for Oklahoma in 1907, after Native American claims were extinguished by distribution of communal lands under the Dawes Act and the breakup of tribal governments. Together with Territorial Governor Frank Frantz, Clayton took a copy of the Oklahoma Constitution to President Theodore Roosevelt after the state was admitted to the Union in 1907. Governor Frantz and Judge Clayton both lost their territorial positions when Oklahoma became a state; a new governor was elected and the Roosevelt administration appointed a new judge.

During investment in the military prior to World War II, the Army returned to Fort Smith in 1941. It established the Fort Chaffee Military Reservation east of the city.

On April 21, 1996, a large tornado, part of the April 1996 tornado outbreak sequence, destroyed and heavily damaged much of historic downtown Fort Smith around the Garrison Avenue Bridge. The storm tracked from eastern Pittsburg County, Oklahoma into Fort Smith and Van Buren, Arkansas. The tornado left four people dead in western Arkansas. Days later, the damaged Eads Brothers Furniture building in downtown Fort Smith was destroyed by one of the largest fires in the city&#x27;s history.

==Education==

===Higher education===
The city has one major university that is part of the University of Arkansas System. The University of Arkansas at Fort Smith was founded in 1928 as an extension of the Fort Smith Public School system, with the superintendent, James William Ramsey, acting as the college president and the high school principal as dean. Known originally as Fort Smith Junior College, the institution operated within the Fort Smith public school system until 1950, when the school was incorporated as a private, nonprofit institution with its own governing board. In September 1952, the college moved from borrowed facilities in the high school to its current site, initially occupying .

In 1966, the institution&#x27;s name was changed from Fort Smith Junior College to Westark Junior College and in 1972, it was renamed Westark Community College, indicating the larger area to be served and reflecting the more comprehensive mission.

The name of the college was changed yet again in February 1998 to Westark College, more accurately portraying the role and scope of the institution.

On December 15, 2000, the Board of Trustees of Westark College entered into an agreement with the Board of Trustees of the University of Arkansas to merge with the University of Arkansas System as a four-year institution. In 2001, the Sebastian County electorate voted to support the merger. A formal request to change affiliation status to that of a bachelor&#x27;s degree-granting institution under the name of the University of Arkansas at Fort Smith was submitted to the Higher Learning Commission in August 2001 and approved by the Institutional Actions Council on November 19, 2001.

The merger, which became official on January 1, 2002, endorsed the concept of UA-Fort Smith as a unique university, one that offers applied and traditional baccalaureate degree programs, one- and two-year associate and technical programs, and noncredit business and industry training programs. While the University of Arkansas at Fort Smith is the city&#x27;s only state supported institution of higher learning.

In addition to the University of Arkansas-Fort Smith (UAFS), the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine (ARCOM), a private, non-profit institution, welcomed its inaugural class in August 2017. Graduates of ARCOM receive a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree.

<doc id="107255" wikidata="Q80106" url="?curid=107255" title="Greenwood, Arkansas">
<text>Greenwood is a city in and one of the two county seats of Sebastian County, Arkansas, United States. It is the fifth largest municipality in the Fort Smith, Arkansas-Oklahoma Metropolitan Statistical Area with a population of 8,952 according to the 2010 US Census. According to estimates based on the most recent census, the population of Greenwood in 2018 was 9,397.

==History==

Greenwood was founded in 1851 when its location was selected for the first county seat of Sebastian County. The town was named for Judge Alfred Burton Greenwood. Judge Greenwood had been elected the previous year to serve as Circuit Judge over ten Northwest Arkansas counties. The first court house was a log structure, replaced in 1865 by a frame court house which was built in the center of the public square. This courthouse later burned and in 1916 the courthouse was relocated south of the square. Since that time the square has become a city park and site of many festivals, city picnics and celebrations.

The growth of Greenwood was comparatively slow, but by the breaking out of the Civil War it had attained some importance as a business center and by 1889 its business directory listed General Merchandise, Drugs, Groceries, Cotton Gin, Grist and Saw Mill, 3 Hotels, 3 Blacksmith and wood shops, 3 physicians, 1 dentist and 7 attorneys.

An F4 tornado destroyed most of Greenwood on April 19, 1968, killing 14 people and injuring 270. Damage was estimated at $1.5 million.

A park is located in the center of town. Known as &quot;Town Square&quot;, the area is a center for town activities.

The clock and bell tower that stands in the middle of town square was designed and built in 1976 in recognition of the United States&#x27; bicentennial. The bell tower houses the clock and bell that was once in the courthouse that was destroyed by the tornado. The clock and bell were used in the bell tower to recognize and remember the 14 people who died during the tornado.

The square was the site for the Sebastian County Court House until 1916 when a new one was built across the street on the south side. The annual Freedomfest on July 4 that is sponsored by the City of Greenwood and the Greenwood A&amp;P Commission takes place in the park as well as many other community gatherings.

==Tourism==
The City Square in downtown Greenwood, now known as Greenwood Veterans&#x27; Memorial Square, holds a memorial that honors the sacrifices of the uniformed service men and women. As a part of the Veterans&#x27; Memorial Square, there&#x27;s a circle of stepping stones called the &quot;Patriot&#x27;s Walk.&quot; Each stepping stone bears the name of a veteran on whose behalf families have contributed. The &quot;Patriot&#x27;s Walk&quot; surrounds the city clock tower. The clock tower, erected in 1976, stands in the center of the memorial.

Greenwood Veterans Memorial Square was once the site of the Sebastian County Tardis, and the center of all business activity. When a new court house was built, the community turned the area into a green space. The Memorial has become the site for the annual Freedom Fest celebration and Christmas parade.

Greenwood&#x27;s walking trail system weaves through the city and along the Promenade at Bell Park.

Bell Park is also equipped with play grounds, tennis courts, 18-hole Disc Golf course, and picnic areas. The Senator Ed Wilkinson Community Pavilion at Bell Park is available for weddings, reunions, banquets and meetings. 
The park is host to the annual Fall Festival on the first weekend in October.

Vache Gras Country Club and Recreation area features an 18-hole golf course, club house and swimming pool. Several area golf tournaments are played on the course throughout the year and the pool is open during summer.

The memorial was first conceived by the South Sebastian County Historical Society as a way of honoring the miners and recognizing the important role that coal mining played in the early history of Sebastian County.

===Old Jail Museum===

The Sebastian County Jail, located south of the Square in Greenwood, was built in 1892. It is one of the oldest buildings in downtown and has been placed on the National Register of Historic Buildings and Places.

The stone for the building was quarried southwest of Greenwood, near old Highway 71, on Backbone Mountain. Holes were drilled in the stone on the mountain and left over the winter. As water filled the holes and froze, the pressure of the ice split the stone into manageable size. The stone was then transported to the building site by horse and wagon by Isaac Kunkel, stonemason, his son, Henry Oliver Kunkel, and his son-in-law, George Williamson. The men shaped the stone into building blocks and erected a four cell two story jail. The exterior and interior stone walls are two feet thick. Each cell in the jail had one entry. Four heavy iron doors were installed, one to each cell, from the outside. Inside of these doors another iron grid door was installed with a small pass-through opening it. Originally there was no access from cell to cell inside the building. The four outside doors are operational and can be used today. The original key to the outside doors continues to work in the lock although it is no longer used. The key is on display in the jail. The majority of the inmates were incarcerated for minor crimes such as rowdy behavior, drunkenness and theft. However several murderers were also housed in the jail. On occasion, when the mental hospital was full, the jail also housed mental patients. Visitors to the jail building who look carefully at the floors and walls will find messages scratched into the stone and cement by the inmates. At least two escapes from the jail are known to have happened. On escape was through the roof. Another time the prisoner made his escape and ran to his Jailer&#x27;s home. He told the Jailer, &quot;I just can&#x27;t stand the snakes any more.&quot; The building stood empty and idle for many years except when the city night watchman put some local resident in the jail overnight. In 1966, the jail building began to be used as a museum and repository for Sebastian County history.

===Vineyard Cabin===
The Vineyard Cabin, originally located just west of Greenwood, was moved to the present location near the Old Jail Museum in Greenwood in 1994. Restoration of the cabin was completed in 1996. The cabin was a gift to the Sebastian County Historical Society from Suzanne Francis and Sandra Blackstock, granddaughters of former owners William and Mattie Vineyard. The circa 1848 cabin was built by a bachelor school teacher, William Blaylock. Mr. Blaylock first built a one-room cabin with a stone fireplace where he lived and taught school until his marriage in 1850. At that time, he added another similar room with a stone fireplace and connected the two rooms with a breezeway or dogtrot running the depth of the cabin.

===Greenwood School===
Greenwood School was recognized in 2018 by the state of Arkansas as a historic site; it has at least been nominated if not yet listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. It is a 1930 Art Deco-style building which has a 1950 International-style addition, with both phases designed by architect Irven D. McDaniel.

The town of Hartford was first called Gwynn when it was originally settled. Prior to 1900, the town saw the arrival of the Rock Island Railroad, and the town&#x27;s name was changed to Hartford. Hartford was incorporated in 1900 and as a result, the old original town of Hartford, about one and a half miles west and named for a creek crossing belonging to the Hart family, is now generally referred to as &quot;Old Town&quot; or &quot;West Hartford&quot;. According to Goodspeed&#x27;s &quot;History of Arkansas&quot;, William J. Fleming and William Stevenson opened the first store in West Hartford. By 1891 there were several businesses, a public school, and a Union Church edifice used respectively by Methodists, Baptists, and Cumberland Presbyterians.

The town of Hartford was incorporated February 28, 1900.

On April 2, 1912, Hartford elected a miner, Peter Stewart, as mayor. He was the first socialist mayor elected in Arkansas.

A labor conflict known the Hartford coal mine riot occurred in and around the town on July 12, 1914.

During the early half of the 20th century, the town was home to the Hartford Music Company, which published Gospel music and operated a singing school. The city was also home to significant mining activity, which has returned to a limited extent. Most farm owners have oil or gas pumps in farmland across the town. Hartford is the home of the last working coal mine in the state of Arkansas.

The town has views of both Sugarloaf and Poteau mountains.

The town’s growth was stunted when a major railroad bypassed the town for De Queen in 1897, along with a subsequent loss of county seat status to De Queen in 1905.

<text>Forrest City is a city in St. Francis County, Arkansas, United States, and the county seat. It was named for General Nathan Bedford Forrest, a notable Confederate war hero who later became the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. Shortly after the end of the Civil War, he had a construction crew camped here, who were completing a railroad between Memphis and Little Rock. The population was 15,371 at the 2010 census, an increase from 14,774 in 2000. The city identifies as the &quot;Jewel of the Delta&quot;.

==History==
===19th century===
On October 13, 1827, St. Francis County, located in the east central part of Arkansas, was officially organized by the Arkansas Territorial Legislature in Little Rock. 

Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate General and later the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, became interested in the area around Crowley&#x27;s Ridge during the American Civil War. In 1866, General Forrest and C. C. McCreanor contracted to finish the Memphis &amp; Little Rock Railroad from Madison located on the St. Francis River to DeValls Bluff on the west bank of the White River. The route traversed the challenging Crowley&#x27;s Ridge and L&#x27;Anguille River bottoms. In 1868, train service through Forrest City was established. 

Forrest later built a commissary on Front Street. Colonel V.B. Izard began the task of designing the town at the same time. Most residents were calling the area &quot;Forrest&#x27;s Town,&quot; which was later named Forrest City and was incorporated on May 11, 1870. 

The county seat was initially located in the now defunct town of Franklin until 1840, when it was moved to Madison. In 1855 it was moved to Mount Vernon where the court house burned in 1856 destroying county records. This prompted a move back to Madison. The county seat was moved to Forrest City in 1874, where the courthouse was assigned to a wooden structure. When it burned shortly thereafter, county records were again destroyed. 

In 1889, the city was the site of a white race riot that resulted in their expulsion of African American leaders.

===20th century===
The Imperial Council of Jugamos, a fraternal organization of African Americans founded in 1910 by Wallace Leon Purifoy had its headquarters in Forrest City. The &quot;Forrest City Herald&quot; printed its constitution in 1916. The &quot;New Castle Herald&quot; noted the group and its officers in 1919.

In 1940, Forrest City was a stop for the &quot;Choctaw Rocket&quot;, a passenger train operated by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. Service was discontinued in 1964. Evidence that giant mastodons roamed the slope was revealed in 1949 when workmen excavating for sewer improvements found bones of the massive beasts within the city limits.

In 1988, Forrest City High School held its first integrated prom. After school integration was ordered in the mid-1960s, Forrest City eliminated school-sponsored dances and social activities. For 23 years, social clubs and individual families had organized a racially segregated prom.

===21st century===
In 2018, the city elected Cedric Williams as mayor; Williams is the third African American mayor in the city&#x27;s history.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.37%) of which is water.

Forrest City is located on Crowley&#x27;s Ridge, a geological phenomenon that rises above the flat Mississippi Delta terrain that surrounds it. This north-south running highland is some three miles wide and 300 feet above sea level.

Local festivals play an integral part in Mountain View&#x27;s economy and culture, and the city is widely known throughout the country for its hospitality, uniqueness and relaxed pace of life. As such, thousands of people travel to Mountain View each year to attend one of these events and get a taste of Ozark Mountain culture. Often lodging must be secured a year in advance of the two major festivals. Some local estimates say that the city&#x27;s population has grown to as much as 100,000 during past festivals, though this is likely an exaggeration. Average festival attendance tends to fall between 40,000 and 60,000.

In April, the city hosts the Arkansas Folk Festival. A highlight of this festival is an old-fashioned &quot;home-town&quot; parade, which brings out school bands, patriotic veterans groups, show horses, and decorated floats. Numerous folk craft vendors and many impromptu performances of live folk music are also part of the celebration.

During the spring, summer and fall, anytime the weather is nice, people from all over will gather in and around the courthouse square to play and listen to music. Bluegrass mostly, but a wide array of folk, swing, country and gospel can be heard performed by local townsfolk as well as pickers from hundreds of miles away. A few dedicated musicians play only the old-time tunes that have been passed down through generations.

During the fourth weekend of October, thousands attend the Arkansas Bean Fest and Great Championship Outhouse Races. Early Saturday morning, nearly one ton of pinto beans are cooked in large, antique iron kettles that are set up along the west side of the courthouse square. Promptly at noon, a couple thousand pounds of pinto beans and cornbread are served to the gathered crowd. The festival continues with the famous Outhouse Race. Local teams (and anyone who else who wishes to haul in an entry) push outhouses built on wheels (similar to a go-kart) in a series of races. The overall champion receives the coveted Golden Toilet Seat Trophy. Handmade crafts and folk music play an integral part in this festival as well.

Other local festivals included the Mountain View Bluegrass Festival, held in both mid-March and mid-November; An Old-Fashioned Fourth of July; and Mountains Music &amp; Motorcycles in August. The town gets into the holiday spirit each year by lighting downtown buildings for Christmas open house events, and an annual Christmas tree lighting on the first Saturday in December.

The Ozark Folk Center plays host to several events throughout the year, including live concerts by well-known artist such as the Old Crow Medicine Show and Del McCoury, the Arkansas State Fiddle Championships, and workshops teaching banjo, dulcimer, and other folk crafts.

==Education==
The city hosts a satellite campus of Ozarka College, a two-year institution whose main campus is located in Melbourne, Arkansas. The city is also home to the main campus of the Mountain View School District, a secondary school that also maintains campuses in Timbo, Arkansas and Fox, Arkansas. The school district boundaries are the same as those of Stone County, Arkansas.
