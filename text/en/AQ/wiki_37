<text>Lebanon ( ) is a town in New London County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Southeastern Connecticut Planning Region. The population was 7,142 at the 2020 census. The town lies just to the northwest of Norwich, directly south of Willimantic, north of New London, and east of Hartford. It is best known for its role in the American Revolution, when it was a major base of American operations, and for its historic town green, which is one of the largest in the nation and the only one still used partially for agriculture.

==History==

===From Poquechaneed to Lebanon===
Lebanon was originally inhabited by the Mohegan people, an Algonquian-speaking tribe in the upper Thames River Valley in eastern Connecticut. The area was known as &quot;Poquechaneed&quot; and was used primarily for hunting.

Lebanon was settled by colonists from Norwich who wanted to expand beyond the nine square miles that they had bought from Mohegan sachem Uncas. In 1663, the first grant in the area was given to Major John Mason, deputy governor of the Connecticut Colony; the next year, Mason accepted northwest of Norwich. This area was known as &quot;Pomakuck&quot; or &quot;Pomocook&quot; by the Mohegans and is now the Goshen Hill area of Lebanon.

In 1666, Connecticut granted an additional to the Rev. James Fitch, minister of Norwich, adjacent to Maj. Mason&#x27;s land which was now known as Cedar Swamp. The Mohegans conferred their blessing on the grants by giving an additional strip to Maj. Mason&#x27;s son in 1675, who split the land with the Rev. Fitch, his father-in-law. This area is now known as &quot;Fitch and Mason&#x27;s Mile&quot;, or just &quot;The Mile&quot;.

In 1692, Uncas&#x27; son Owaneco sold to four men from Norwich and Stonington known as the &quot;Five Mile Purchase&quot; or &quot;Five Mile Square&quot;, being on each side. With the Purchase, most of the town of Lebanon was established.

The town of Lebanon was incorporated by the General Assembly of the Connecticut Colony on October 10, 1700. The town&#x27;s name was the idea of one of Rev. Fitch&#x27;s sons, because of &quot;the height of the land, and a large cedar forest.&quot; Lebanon was the first town in the Connecticut Colony to be given a Biblical name. From its incorporation in 1700, Lebanon was part of New London County. In 1724 it became part of the newly created Windham County where it remained until 1826 when it was reassigned to New London County.

===&quot;Heartbeat of the Revolution&quot;===
Connecticut&#x27;s effort during the Revolutionary War was directed from the War Office on the Green and the adjacent home of Governor Jonathan Trumbull Sr.

William Williams was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. He was a native of Lebanon and son-in-law to Governor Trumbull.

Trumbull was the only colonial governor to side with the Patriots during the Revolution. He served as one of George Washington&#x27;s chief quartermasters, convening a Council of Safety to manage the affairs of the Continental Army. The council met over 1,100 times, mostly in Trumbull&#x27;s own house on the Lebanon Green. He was also paymaster general for the Northern Department of the Continental Army, and the first comptroller of the young nation&#x27;s treasury during the war.

Trumbull&#x27;s children were also influential in the war effort. Joseph Trumbull was a colonel in the Continental Army, Jonathan Trumbull Jr. was secretary to George Washington, and John Trumbull served first as a soldier and then as Washington&#x27;s personal aide during the war.

French duc de Lauzun&#x27;s Legion of Horse encamped in Lebanon from November 1780 to June 21, 1781. The legion became infamous later for disorderliness, dueling, and pillaging, but they were generally well behaved in Lebanon. However, two officers were executed by firing squad for attempted desertion while here. The local economy benefited only slightly from the troops&#x27; extended stay. In June, the soldiers rode off toward White Plains, New York. Lauzun remarked later in his memoirs, &quot;Siberia alone can furnish any idea of Lebanon, which consists of a few huts scattered among vast forests.&quot;

The importance of the Trumbull family and of Lebanon itself to the war effort earned the town the nickname &quot;Heartbeat of the Revolution.&quot;

===Into the 19th and 20th centuries===
Joseph Trumbull, father of Jonathan Trumbull Sr., brought livestock farming to the town in 1704, and Lebanon had the largest meat packing industry in Connecticut by 1730. Agriculture has since been the primary focus of the town. The Trumbull family left Lebanon after the death of Jonathan Trumbull Jr. in 1809, and the town&#x27;s political significance fell.

Lebanon maintained its focus on agriculture and remained a dedicated farming town, as the towns around it became more commercialized. It was this characteristic that brought a major wave of immigration in the early 20th century. Political troubles in Russia and the onset of the First World War encouraged many to flee to America. The village of Karlswalde near Ostrog saw its entire population leave. Philip Krause settled in the Village Hill area of Lebanon. The town offered similar terrain and fertile farming ground, and 12 families of Karlswalde had moved to the Lebanon neighborhood by 1928. Many of these families are still present and active in Lebanon today and have been a major influence on the town&#x27;s culture.

The Liberty Hill neighborhood was the commercial center of town for most of the 19th century and into the 20th, holding the town&#x27;s post office and two general stores. It was Lebanon&#x27;s primary link to the larger Connecticut and New England communities. The area maintained its importance into the 1940s.

Lebanon saw more than ten percent of its residents leave to fight in the Second World War. The Memorial Day parade is still one of the town&#x27;s largest annual celebrations.

===Present===
The town has large agricultural and service sectors, the largest employers being farms and the school system. KofKoff Egg Farms is New England&#x27;s largest egg producer, and it maintains a farm in the town. The Lebanon Country Fair is known for its agricultural shows. The Lebanon School District is responsible for the town&#x27;s three schools: Lyman Memorial High School, Lebanon Middle School, and Lebanon Elementary School. The town is still centered around the Green which is the site of many of Lebanon&#x27;s most prominent past citizens&#x27; homes, including Gov. Trumbull and William Beaumont. First Congregational Church of Lebanon, Lebanon Baptist Church, and Saint Francis of Assisi Roman Catholic Church are also located on the Green. The Jonathan Trumbull Library is also located on the Green, as are the War Office, the Jonathan Trumbull Jr. house, and the Wadsworth Stable. The Redeemer Lutheran Church is located at the Village Hill area of town, with the Lebanon Bible Church and Goshen Congregational Church located in the Goshen area.

<text>Lyme is a town in New London County, Connecticut, United States, situated on the eastern side of the Connecticut River. The town is part of the Lower Connecticut River Valley Planning Region. The population was 2,352 at the 2020 census. Lyme is the eponym of Lyme disease.

==History==
In February 1665, the portion of the territory of the Saybrook Colony east of the Connecticut River was set off as the plantation of East Saybrook, which included present-day Lyme, Old Lyme, and the western part of East Lyme. In 1667, the Connecticut General Court formally recognized the East Saybrook plantation as the town of Lyme, named after Lyme Regis, a coastal town in the southwest of England. The eastern portion of Lyme (bordering the town of Waterford) separated from Lyme in 1823 and became part of East Lyme. The southern portion of Lyme (along Long Island Sound) separated in 1855 as South Lyme (renamed Old Lyme in 1857). Both changes were consistent with the then-existing laws of the state of Connecticut.

<doc id="108824" wikidata="Q1129455" url="?curid=108824" title="Unijunction transistor">
<text>A unijunction transistor (UJT) is a three-lead electronic semiconductor device with only one junction. It acts exclusively as an electrically controlled switch.

The UJT is not used as a linear amplifier. It is used in free-running oscillators, synchronized or triggered oscillators, and pulse generation circuits at low to moderate frequencies (hundreds of kilohertz). It is widely used in the triggering circuits for silicon controlled rectifiers. In the 1960s, the low cost per unit, combined with its unique characteristic, warranted its use in a wide variety of applications like oscillators, pulse generators, saw-tooth generators, triggering circuits, phase control, timing circuits, and voltage- or current-regulated supplies. The original unijunction transistor types are now considered obsolete, but a later multi-layer device, the programmable unijunction transistor, is still widely available.

==Types==

There are three types of unijunction transistor:
# The original unijunction transistor, or UJT, is a simple device that is essentially a bar of n-type semiconductor material into which p-type material has been diffused somewhere along its length, fixing the device parameter formula_1 (the &quot;intrinsic stand-off ratio&quot;). The 2N2646 model is the most commonly used version of the UJT.
# The complementary unijunction transistor, or CUJT, is a bar of p-type semiconductor material into which n-type material has been diffused somewhere along its length, defining the device parameter formula_1. The 2N6114 model is one version of the CUJT.
# The programmable unijunction transistor, or PUT, is a multi-junction device that, with two external resistors, displays similar characteristics to the UJT. It is a close cousin to the thyristor and like the thyristor consists of four p-n layers. It has an anode and a cathode connected to the first and the last layer respectively, and a gate connected to one of the inner layers. PUTs are not directly interchangeable with conventional UJTs but perform a similar function. In a proper circuit configuration with two &quot;programming&quot; resistors for setting the parameter formula_1, they behave like a conventional UJT. The 2N6027, 2N6028 and BRY39 models are examples of such devices.

==Applications==
Unijunction transistor circuits were popular in hobbyist electronics circuits in the 1960s and 1970s because they allowed simple oscillators to be built using just one active device. For example, they were used for relaxation oscillators in variable-rate strobe lights.
Later, as integrated circuits became more popular, oscillators such as the 555 timer IC became more commonly used.

In addition to its use as the active device in relaxation oscillators, one of the most important applications of UJTs or PUTs is to trigger thyristors (silicon controlled rectifiers (SCR), TRIACs, etc.). A DC voltage can be used to control a UJT or PUT circuit such that the &quot;on-period&quot; increases with an increase in the DC control voltage. This application is important for large AC current control.

UJTs can also be used to measure magnetic flux. The Hall effect modulates the voltage at the PN junction. This affects the frequency of UJT relaxation oscillators. This only works with UJTs. PUTs do not exhibit this phenomenon.

== Construction ==

The UJT has three terminals: an emitter (E) and two bases (B1 and B2) and so is sometimes known a &quot;double-base diode&quot;. The base is formed by a lightly doped n-type bar of silicon. Two ohmic contacts B1 and B2 are attached at its ends. The emitter is of heavily-doped p-type material. The single PN junction between the emitter and the base gives the device its name. The resistance between B1 and B2 when the emitter is open-circuit is called &quot;interbase resistance&quot;. The emitter junction is usually located closer to base-2 (B2) than base-1 (B1) so that the device is not symmetrical, because a symmetrical unit does not provide optimum electrical characteristics for most of the applications.

If no potential difference exists between its emitter and either of its base leads, there is an extremely small current from B1 to B2. On the other hand, if an adequately large voltage relative to its base leads, known as the &quot;trigger voltage&quot;, is applied to its emitter, then a very large current from its emitter joins the current from B1 to B2, which creates a larger B2 output current.

The schematic diagram symbol for a unijunction transistor represents the emitter lead with an arrow, showing the direction of conventional current when the emitter-base junction is conducting a current. A complementary UJT uses a p-type base and an n-type emitter, and operates the same as the n-type base device but with all voltage polarities reversed.

The structure of a UJT is similar to that of an N-channel JFET, but p-type (gate) material surrounds the N-type (channel) material in a JFET, and the gate surface is larger than the emitter junction of UJT. A UJT is operated with the emitter junction forward-biased while the JFET is normally operated with the gate junction reverse-biased. The UJT is a current-controlled negative resistance device.

==Device operation==
The device has a unique characteristic in that when it is triggered, its emitter current increases regeneratively until it is restricted by the emitter power supply. It exhibits a negative resistance characteristic and so it can be employed as an oscillator.

The UJT is biased with a positive voltage between the two bases. This causes a potential drop along the length of the device. When the emitter voltage is driven approximately one diode voltage above the voltage at the point where the P diffusion (emitter) is, current will begin to flow from the emitter into the base region. Because the base region is very lightly doped, the additional current (actually charges in the base region) causes conductivity modulation, which reduces the resistance of the portion of the base between the emitter junction and the B2 terminal. This reduction in resistance means that the emitter junction is more forward biased, and so even more current is injected. Overall, the effect is a negative resistance at the emitter terminal. This is what makes the UJT useful, especially in simple oscillator circuits.

==Invention==
The unijunction transistor was invented as a byproduct of research on germanium tetrode transistors at General Electric. It was patented in 1953. Commercially, silicon devices were manufactured. A common part number is 2N2646.

<text>Montville is a town in New London County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Southeastern Connecticut Planning Region. The population was 18,387 at the 2020 census.

The villages of Chesterfield, Mohegan, Oakdale, and Uncasville are located within the town; the latter two have their own ZIP Codes. Town residents often identify with these villages more than the Town of Montville as a whole. The Mohegan Sun casino resort is located in the village of Uncasville.

==History==

In the 17th century, when English settlers arrived, southeastern Connecticut was the scene of rivalry between the Pequot people, the dominant Native American group in the New London area, and the newly independent Mohegan. The latter became friendly to the English. For defense against the Pequot, the Mohegan sachem Uncas had established a fortified village on a promontory above the Thames River within what is now the town of Montville. The Mohegan village, now known as Fort Shantok, was protected on the inland side by palisades first built in about 1636 at the time of the Pequot War, rebuilt during wars with the Narragansett people –1657, and rebuilt again at the time of King Philip&#x27;s War (1675–1676).

When the boundaries of New London (then called &quot;Pequot&quot;) were first defined in 1646, the Oxoboxo River formed the northern boundary. Parts of the modern town of Montville lying south of the river were included in New London, while the area north of the river was treated as Mohegan land. Over time the settlers assumed control of the Mohegan lands. The first grants were made by Uncas in 1658 to Richard Houghton and James Rogers, consisting of valuable farms along the river. Some Mohegan grants were gifts of friendship or by fair trade, while others were openly fraudulent. By 1703 the area between the Oxoboxo River and Norwich (now part of the town of Montville) was annexed by New London.

In 1786 Montville was separated from New London and incorporated as a separate Town. Before incorporation, it was known as the North Parish of New London. In 1819 the adjacent Town of Salem was formed from parts of the towns of Montville, Lyme, and Colchester. The name &quot;Montville&quot; signifies &quot;mountain village&quot;.

===National Register of Historic Places===

Four properties in town are listed on the National Register of Historic Places:
* Bridge No. 1860 on Massapeag Side Rd. (Rt. 433) over Shantok Brook, Fort Shantok SP (added August 29, 1993)
* Fort Shantok Archeological District (added April 20, 1986)
* Raymond-Bradford Homestead on Raymond Hill Rd. (added May 16, 1982)
* Uncasville School, which now serves as the Montville Town Hall, at 310 Norwich-New London Turnpike (added March 23, 2001)

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 5.06%, is water.

===Principal communities===
* Chesterfield
* Kitemaug
* Massapeag
* Mohegan
* Oakdale
* Palmertown
* Uncasville

Town residents often identify with these villages more than the Town of Montville as a whole. The center of Oakdale is small, consisting of only a few private residences and the post office. The Mohegan Sun casino resort is often referred to as being in Uncasville, although the village is three miles to the south. The Mohegan refer to Uncasville as it is named for a prominent &quot;sachem&quot; of theirs from the 17th century.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 18,546 people, 6,426 households, and 4,678 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 6,805 housing units at an average density of .

The average household size was 2.63 and the average family size was 3.05.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 23.6% under the age of 18, 8.5% from 18 to 24, 34.2% from 25 to 44, 22.8% from 45 to 64, and 10.8% who were 65 years of age or older.

Part of Montville is also treated by the U.S. Census Bureau as a census-designated place called Oxoboxo River.

==American Indians==

The Mohegan Native American Tribal Nation has been a presence in this area of Connecticut since the 16th century, and descended from indigenous cultures in the area for thousands of years. In the seventeenth century, the colony of Connecticut granted them a reservation, located north of the present-day village of Uncasville. Although the reservation is within the borders of the town of Montville, the tribe is federally recognized as a sovereign nation not subject to local or state laws. In addition to operating the Mohegan Sun, a casino resort that opened in 1996, the tribal nation also provides educational programs about their nation&#x27;s heritage and history.

==Residents of Chinese descent==
Since at least the 1990s, people of Chinese descent have moved into the area drawn either by the work available at Mohegan Sun and the rising prices in the Northeast&#x27;s Chinatowns. Their presence, the subject of an exhibition that travelled from the Lyman Allyn Museum in New London to New York City&#x27;s Museum of Chinese in America, has sparked at least one allegedly racist incident.

==Education==

Public schools in Montville are overseen by Montville Public Schools, the town&#x27;s public school system, operated by a board that includes nine elected members and two high school student representatives. The school system operates a regular high school, an alternative high school, a middle school, and three elementary schools.

Montville High School serves grades 9 through 12. Enrollment is approximately 800 students.

The town is also home to private boarding school St. Thomas More School, known for its basketball program. 

==Economy==

===Power plant===
NRG Energy Inc., based in La Jolla, California, operates an oil and natural gas-powered electricity generating plant in Montville, labeled by environmentalists as one of the &quot;Sooty Six&quot;, the dirtiest power plants in the state. The plant was required to install pollution controls to comply with the state&#x27;s 2002 power plant pollution law. In June 2006 the company proposed building a new type of coal-powered plant on the site for $1.6 billion.

In return for building the plant, the company demanded that the state guarantee NRG long-term contracts for buying the electricity it generates and pick NRG&#x27;s proposal over other plans for building new power plants in the state. At the time of NRG&#x27;s proposal, only 18 plants in the world and two in North America used the Integrated Gasification Combined-Cycle technology which the company suggested. Contracts were to be awarded by the DPUC in early 2007. The company said the new plant could open in 2012. NRG Energy announced plans on August 5, 2013, to add fuel cells, solar and biomass conversion to the plant

<doc id="108826" wikidata="Q585623" url="?curid=108826" title="Mystic, Connecticut">
<text>Mystic is a village and census-designated place (CDP) in Groton and Stonington, Connecticut, United States.

Mystic was a significant Connecticut seaport with more than 600 ships built over 135 years starting in 1784. Mystic Seaport, located in the village, is the largest maritime museum in the United States and has preserved a number of sailing ships, such as the whaling ship &quot;Charles W. Morgan&quot;. The village is located on the Mystic River which flows into Fishers Island Sound. The Mystic River Bascule Bridge crosses the river in the center of the village. The name &quot;Mystic&quot; is derived from the Pequot term &quot;missi-tuk&quot; describing a large river whose waters are driven into waves by tides or wind. The population was 4,348 at the 2020 census.

==History==
thumb|[Mystic River and Mystic Bridge, Connecticut (1879)
Before the 17th century, the Pequot people lived in this portion of southeastern Connecticut. They were in control of a considerable amount of territory, extending toward the Pawcatuck River to the east and the Connecticut River to the west.

To the northwest, the Five Nations of the Iroquois dominated the land linked by the Great Lakes and the Hudson River, allowing trading to occur between the Iroquois and the Dutch. The Pequots were settled just distant enough to be secure from any danger that the Iroquois posed. The Pequot War profoundly affected the Mystic area between 1636 and 1638. In May 1637, captains John Underhill and John Mason led a mission through Narragansett land, along with their allies the Narragansetts and Mohegans, and struck the Pequot Indian settlement in Mystic in the event which came to be known as the Mystic massacre. On September 21, 1638, the colonists signed the Treaty of Hartford, officially ending the Pequot War.

===English settlement===
Pequot control of the Mystic area ended after the Pequot War, and English settlements increased. By the 1640s, Connecticut Colony began to grant land to the Pequot War veterans. John Winthrop the Younger was among those to receive property, much of which was in southeastern Connecticut. Other early settlers in the Mystic area included Robert Burrows and George Denison, who held land in the Mystic River Valley.

Settlement grew slowly. The Connecticut government and Massachusetts Bay government began to quarrel over boundaries, thus causing some conflicting claims concerning governmental authority between the Mystic River and the Pawcatuck River. In the 1640s and 1650s, &quot;Connecticut&quot; referred to settlements located along the Connecticut River, as well as its claims in other parts of the region. Massachusetts Bay, however, claimed to have authority over Stonington and even into Rhode Island.

Connecticut did not have a royal charter that separated it from the Massachusetts Bay Colony; the Connecticut General Court was formed by leaders of the settlements. The General Court claimed rule of the area by right of conquest, but the Massachusetts Bay Colony saw matters differently. The Bay Colony had contributed to the war by sending a militia under captains John Underhill and Thomas Stoughton, which they argued gave territorial rights and authority to the Massachusetts Bay Colony rather than the Connecticut Court.

Both colonies turned to the United Colonies of New England to resolve the dispute. The United Colonies of New England was formed in 1643, established to settle disputes such as this one. They voted to establish the boundary between the claims of Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut at the Thames River. As a result, Connecticut would be positioned west of the river, and Massachusetts Bay could have the land to the east, including the Mystic River.
Throughout the next decade, colonists were beginning to settle around the Mystic River. John Mason was one of the captains who led the colonists against the Pequots, and he had been granted on the eastern banks of the Mystic River. He also received the island that now bears his name, though he never lived on the property. In 1653, John Gallup, Jr. was given approximately midway up the east part of the Mystic River.

Within the same year, others joined John Gallup and began to settle around the Mystic River. George Denison, a veteran of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s army, was given his own strip of just south of Gallup&#x27;s land in 1654. Thomas Miner had immigrated to Massachusetts with John Winthrop and was granted many land plots, the main one lying on Quiambaug Cove, just east of the Mystic River. Other families granted land were Reverend Robert Blinman, the Beebe brothers, Thomas Parke, and Connecticut Governor John Hayne.

Not all these men actually lived on their land. Many sold it to profit from or employed an overseer to cultivate their property. Many men, however, actually brought their wives and children, which indicated their plans on forming a community in the Mystic River Valley.

There was one recorded case of a woman who did not come to the Mystic River Valley as a wife. Widow Margaret Lake received a grant from the Massachusetts Bay authority and was the only woman to receive a land grant in her own name. She also did not live on her land but hired other people to maintain it. She took up residence in Lakes Pond. Her daughter was married to John Gallup, while her sister was married to Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop.

By 1675, settlement had grown tremendously in the Mystic River Valley, and infrastructure was beginning to appear as well as an economy. The Pequot Trail was used as a main highway to get around the Mystic River and played a vital role in the settlers&#x27; lives, allowing them to transport livestock, crops, furs, and other equipment to and from their farm lands. However, those families living on the east side of the Mystic River were unable to make any use of the Pequot Trail. As early as 1660, Robert Burrows was authorized to institute a ferry somewhere along the middle of the river&#x27;s length. This earned his home the name of &quot;Half-way House&quot;.

The Pequot Trail also connected the settlers to their church. Stonington residents found it difficult to attend church in Mystic or Groton, and this led to the creation of their own church. The town of Stonington was then established as separate from Mystic in regards to church attendance and was granted leave to build a church of their own. The building became known as the Road Church.

Colonists began public schools in this area around 1679, and John Fish became the first schoolmaster in Stonington, conducting classes and lessons in his home. Education was a very important thing to the New England colonists, enabling children and servants to learn literacy skills. Most families throughout New England had six or more children in each household, giving Fish plenty of students.

===18th century===
By the first decade of the 18th century, three villages had begun to develop along the Mystic River. The largest village was called Mystic (now Old Mystic), also known as the Head of the River because it lay where several creeks united into the Mystic River estuary. Two villages lay farther down the river. One was called Stonington and was considered to be Lower Mystic, consisting of twelve houses by the early 19th century. These twelve houses lay along Willow Street, which ended at the ferry landing. This is now the Stonington side of the village of Mystic. On the opposite bank of the river in the town of Groton stood the village that became known as Portersville. This is the Groton side of the village of Mystic.

===National Register of Historic Places===
Mystic has three historic districts: the Mystic Bridge Historic District around U.S. Route 1 and Route 27, Rossie Velvet Mill Historic District between Pleasant Street and Bruggeman Place, and the Mystic River Historic District around U.S. Route 1 and Route 215. Other historic sites in Mystic are:
* &quot;Joseph Conrad (ship)&quot; at Mystic Seaport Museum
* &quot;Charles W. Morgan (ship)&quot; at Mystic Seaport Museum
* &quot;Emma C. Berry (sloop)&quot; at Mystic Seaport Museum
* &quot;L. A. Dunton (schooner)&quot; at Mystic Seaport Museum
* Pequotsepos Manor on Pequotsepos Road
* &quot;Sabino (steamer)&quot; at Mystic Seaport Museum

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 10.6%, is water. The village is on the east and west bank of the estuary of the Mystic River. Mason&#x27;s Island (Pequot language: &quot;Chippachaug&quot;) fills the south end of the estuary. Most of the bedrock of Mystic is &quot;gneissic, crystalline terrane extending from eastern Massachusetts through western Rhode Island and across southeastern Connecticut north of Long Island Sound,&quot; according to geologist Richard Goldsmith.

==Tourism==

The village is a major New England tourist destination. It is home to the Mystic Aquarium &amp; Institute for Exploration, known for its research department, concern with marine life rehabilitation, and its popular beluga whales. The business district contains many restaurants on either side of the bascule bridge where U.S. Route 1 crosses the Mystic River. Local sailing cruises are available on the traditional sailing ship &quot;Argia&quot;. Short day tours and longer evening cruises are available on the 1908 steamer &quot;Sabino&quot; departing Mystic Seaport.

Mystic Seaport is the nation&#x27;s leading maritime museum and one of the premier maritime museums in the world, founded in 1929. It is the home of four National Historic Landmark vessels, including the 1841 whaleship &quot;Charles W. Morgan&quot;, the oldest merchant vessel in the country. The museum&#x27;s collections and exhibits include over 500 historic watercraft, a major research library, a large gallery of maritime art, a unique diorama displaying the town of Mystic as it was in the 19th century, a working ship restoration shipyard, a planetarium, and a recreation of a 19th-century seafaring village.

Mystic Museum of Art at 9 Water Street features works by members of the Mystic Art Colony along with other contemporary American art. The 2013 Moondance International Film Festival was held in Mystic.

The town is located near Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun, two prominent Native American operated integrated resorts.

<text>Noank ( ) is a village in the town of Groton, Connecticut, United States. This dense community of historic homes and local businesses sits on a small, steep peninsula at the mouth of the Mystic River and has a long tradition of fishing, lobstering and boat-building. The village is listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places and is the home of multiple seaside lobster shacks and oyster aquaculture operations. The population was 1,796 at the 2010 census.

==History==
In 1614, the area was known as &quot;Nauyang&quot; (meaning &quot;point of land&quot;) and was a summer camping ground of the Pequot people, but they were driven out in 1655 following the Pequot War. The land comprising Noank Peninsula was acquired by James Morgan through a lottery in 1712.

The community grew from a tradition of fishing, lobstering, and boat-building. In 1861, Charles Mallory and Elihu Spicer, Jr. established the C. H. Mallory and Company Steamship line. In 1879, Robert Palmer put steam railways into his shipbuilding plant in Noank. His company became one of the largest in the United States at the time for making wooden ships, building one thousand vessels ranging from fishing boats to sound steamers. The fishing sailboat type known as the &quot;Noank Smack&quot; is indigenous to this village, such as the &quot;Emma C. Berry&quot; preserved at the Mystic Seaport. Around 1912, the Connecticut State Lobster Hatchery was established in Noank. Today, the village has several marinas, including one with 158 slips.

Noank hosts one of the longest running continuous Memorial Day parades in the country, held annually since 1876. The majority of the community was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 as a historic district, including houses and businesses dating back to 1840. The significance of the historic district is primarily in the domestic architecture preserved in about 260 houses. Scenes for the movie &quot;Mystic Pizza&quot; were filmed at Ford&#x27;s Lobsters in Noank.

==Town history==

===Before the mid-17th century===
The land of North Stonington is located at the southeast corner of the state of Connecticut. Until the 17th century, the Pequots, the Niantics, and the Narragansetts were the residents in this area of southeastern Connecticut and adjacent parts of Rhode Island. Little is known about Native American activities in North Stonington prior to English colonization in the area.

The Pequots&#x27; imprint remained in the town, however. The first white settlers kept a number of their names for the town&#x27;s main geological features, including the town&#x27;s main water course of Shunock Brook, as well as Assekonk Swamp and Wintechog and Cossaduck hills. Colonial authorities eventually allotted two reservations to the Pequot tribe, including a plot of land on the eastern bank of Long Pond adjacent to Lantern Hill in the southwestern corner of the town, established in 1683.

===Colonial era and Revolutionary War: 1670s–1770s===

For much of the 17th century, North Stonington was thinly populated by the Pequots and European settlers. Starting in the 1630s and 1640s, the English established coastline settlements in Wequetequock, which is now Old Mystic, and Pawcatuck. However, the pressure of a growing population and continued immigration in succeeding decades caused homesteading to steadily push northward. The end of hostilities following King Philip&#x27;s War of 1676 and a partial resolution of border disputes among Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts colonies also encouraged enterprising pioneers to move inland to stake claims.

The first settlers to North Stonington were Ezekiel Main and Jeremiah Burch in 1667, who established settlements in the areas which became the village of North Stonington and Clark&#x27;s Falls, respectively. Main was formerly of Massachusetts; he had served in King Philip&#x27;s War and received a land grant in return for his military service. Burch had been a blacksmith in England before making the crossing to America and establishing a land stake. Other pioneers soon followed; families arrived during the 1670s and 1680s who formed the backbone of the town. They were the Mains, Miners, Wheelers, Browns, Palmers, Hewitts, and Averys, to name a few. Among those were John Swan and his family in 1707, for whom Swantown Road is named.

For most of the 18th century, the town&#x27;s inhabitants focused on carving out homesteads and farms from virgin forests. This was a slow, generations-long process, as pioneers girdled massive, centuries-old trees until they rotted and fell to the ground, and then began the difficult work of clearing ground and moving boulders. Roads began to be forged through the receding wilderness, beyond just cattle paths and old Pequot trails. Colonial surveyors in 1753 marked out the future route of the Pawcatuck-Voluntown Road (today known as Route 49). One of those who worked on this project was 16-year-old Silas Deane, who later represented Connecticut during the First and Second Continental Congress and served briefly as one of the United States&#x27; first diplomats in France. In 1768, a weekly stagecoach was opened between Norwich, Connecticut and Providence, Rhode Island via North Stonington and Pawcatuck; this road became the Norwich-Westerly Road, today known as Route 2.

The reluctance of settlers to walk the great distance every Sunday to the Road Church in Stonington led to the establishment of a northern Congregational society in 1717, in which the northern part of Stonington aimed to build its own meeting house. This &quot;North Society&quot; defined a boundary line that is identical to the border today between North Stonington and Stonington, although disagreements lasted until 1723 concerning this line and the location of the northern meeting house, requiring the colonial assembly&#x27;s intervention several times. In 1724, North Stonington gained its name by decree of the Connecticut Assembly. A church was finally erected in 1727 located on a knoll at the junction of Wyassup and Reutemann roads. It gained a permanent minister in 1731, when the Rev. Joseph Fish arrived, newly ordained from Harvard; he served until his death at 76 in 1781. This meeting house stood for about a century and became known as the &quot;Black Church&quot;, perhaps because its board walls were never painted and became dark with age.
The Great Awakening swept through the American colonies in the early- to mid-1740s. One of the main results of this revivalist movement was the rapid growth of the Baptist Church in America, and North Stonington became a bastion of this denomination in Connecticut. Much of the congregation for this church came from Rev. Fish&#x27;s flock, and the new Baptists established their own meeting house in 1743. This was the first Baptist church for both Stonington and North Stonington. The original building sat a couple miles south of the 1830 church atop Pendleton Hill on land donated by Luther Palmer in the town&#x27;s northeastern corner. A stone marker is at the site of the original church.

Turmoil within Rev. Fish&#x27;s congregation culminated in the departure of another group that formed a &quot;Strict Congregationalist Church&quot; in 1746 more than a mile west of the Village. This schism was deeply traumatic for the Rev. Fish, who later wrote that the &quot;order of families as well as of churches and religious families, is vilely broke, dissolved and lost… the reins of government are thrown upon the neck, and nothing but anarchy and confusion reigns.&quot; During 1817–1827, the Congregationalist and Strict Congregationalist churches reunited and built a common church, which is the current location of the town&#x27;s Congregational Church.

The establishment of the other two Baptist churches was considerably less dramatic. The Rev. Waite Palmer organized the Second Baptist Church in 1765, located at the intersection of Pendleton Hill Road and Stillman Road. The third Baptist Church was established in 1828 to serve the rapidly growing population of millworkers in the village of North Stonington.

Men from the town participated in the French and Indian War of the 1760s; some marched as far as the siege of Montreal. But it was the Revolutionary War that garnered the town&#x27;s enthusiasm. It is difficult to determine the precise number of townsmen who joined the fight, given that North Stonington still formed part of Stonington and clerks did not distinguish between the two locales. However, pension records and other documents from the 19th century indicate that numerous men joined various Continental and militia units, particularly the 6th and 8th Militia Regiments, the latter of which joined Gen. George Washington&#x27;s army in the Battle of Long Island in the autumn of 1776. Three North Society men assumed notable roles in the war:
* Thomas Wheeler served first as a junior officer in the militia during a successful standoff against a British naval raiding party against Stonington Borough in August 1775, then served as a company commander in the Eighth Regiment of Militia during the following year&#x27;s campaign in New York.
* Elias Sanford Palmer served as a lieutenant in Wadsworth&#x27;s Brigade during the Long Island campaign in late 1776 and remained in the militia service during the war and beyond; by the 1790s, he was commander of the 30th Militia Regiment.
* Charles Hewitt, an enlisted man, was part of a 40-member raiding party that captured General Richard Prescott at his home in Newport, Rhode Island during the night of July 10, 1777. Prescott was the British commander of a large occupation force of Hessian soldiers. In contrast to Wheeler and Palmer, Hewitt died young, perishing of yellow fever while at sea in 1779.

===Mills and incorporation: Late 18th century to mid-19th century===

As early as the first part of the 18th century first- and second-generation farmers in North Stonington began harnessing the power of the town&#x27;s rivers and streams to establish grist mills and sawmills. For example, Samuel Richardson, one of the first settlers in what is now the village, already had a mill in use along the Shunock River by 1702. However, it was only in the 1790s, after the United States had gained its independence, that mills began to emerge throughout the town in a serious way. The primary reason for this was that the town&#x27;s farmers were no longer focused on clearing land and subsistence cultivation, and were now producing ever-larger crop and livestock yields that could be exported to markets, either in Connecticut or as far away as in Boston and the West Indies. Second, during this period the country was emerging into a period of economic prosperity after the deprivations and uncertainty of the war years.

Mills during the late 18th century quickly began to proliferate in the village along the Shunock River to such an extent that the locale took the name of &quot;Milltown&quot;, and the Avery family and other landowners began to sell lots along what is now the western end of Main Street to house businesses and dwellings for workers in the mills. Smaller communities, with their own churches, post offices, mills, and stores, emerged in Burch&#x27;s Falls (renamed Clark&#x27;s Falls in the 1860s) and Laurel Glen, both in the eastern end of town, and Ashwillet and Pendleton Hill (known as Pauchunganuc until the 1840s), located respectively in the northwestern and northeastern corners of the town. Individual mills also emerged throughout the town to meet the grain and lumber milling needs of local communities at a distance from the five towns within the town.

By the early part of the 19th century North Stonington&#x27;s residents began to regard themselves as possessing a character separate from the communities of the southern part of the town to which they were still connected. The communities of Mystic, Stonington Borough, and Pawcatuck were far away—by the standards of the pre-automobile era—and, being of a seafaring nature, the &quot;southerners&quot; possessed significantly different needs and interests. Efforts by the southern communities from the late 18th century to build a number of relatively expensive construction projects along the coastline, such as a new road from Stonington Borough to Mystic and a bridge over Lambert&#x27;s Cove, at first led residents of the northern end of the town to oppose budgeting monies for these projects, and eventually caused the northerners to secede and form their own town. At a town hall meeting at Stonington&#x27;s Road Church in April 1807, a small majority of voters decided for division, using the old dividing line between the North and South societies of the Congregationalist Church as the demarcation line. The new town then sent a request for the State Assembly to approve the measure.

The Assembly, which met the following month, approved the new town&#x27;s independence, but did not endorse the town&#x27;s proposed new name of Jefferson, and instead directed that the town would be named &quot;North Stonington&quot;, citing as justification that for almost a century the northern part of Stonington had been known by that name. While the Assembly&#x27;s reasoning is superficially logical, its rejection of the name &quot;Jefferson&quot; almost certainly was motivated by the considerable antagonism held by dominant Federalist politicians in Hartford, who led New England in their opposition to President Jefferson and his policies. We do not know the reason why the country&#x27;s third president—then midway through his second term—was so popular among North Stonington residents, although perhaps Jefferson&#x27;s public criticism of the Congregational Church&#x27;s domination of politics and religion in Connecticut earned him the loyalty of the local Baptist community, which perhaps regarded him as a champion of their rights in a state that still enshrined preferential rights to the Congregational Church.

An inventory of the town&#x27;s taxable assets in the following year, 1808, provides a snapshot of the town&#x27;s economic profile. The town was still predominantly devoted to agriculture. 53 percent of the town&#x27;s area was given over to cultivation or pasture, the remainder being taken up by wooded land, much of it in rocky outcrops or in swamps. The town&#x27;s roughly 2,500 residents lived in about 750 dwellings and possessed about 445 mature oxen and bulls, 1,354 cattle, and 388 horses. There were 3,335 sheep, a reflection of the prodigious wool business in the town as a result of trade barriers erected by the United States against British textile imports that spurred considerable domestic demand for woolen products.

At the same time, this same inventory shows the growing affluence in the town, a reflection of the town&#x27;s agricultural wealth and growing mill activity. Five stores—including one with two floors—had sprung up. Two eminent citizens owned chaises: Revolutionary War veteran Elias Sanford Palmer of Pauchunganuc Hill, and Thomas Prentice, who lived in the northwest part of town. Shopkeepers Daniel and Saxton Miner in Milltown owned the sole other vehicle mentioned, a &quot;carriage on springs&quot;. Nine leading citizens, including Elias Sanford Palmer and Thomas Prentice, also possessed another status symbol: clocks with &quot;steel and brass parts&quot;. Serving not just the thirst of the townspeople but also of the many millworkers were nine taverns, five of which were connected with stores.

North Stonington and its older sister Stonington played an enthusiastic role in the War of 1812, even if the war itself was deeply unpopular in Connecticut and elsewhere in New England. During the war North Stonington resident Lieutenant Colonel William Randall, the great-grandson of original settler John Randall, commanded the 30th regiment of Connecticut militia, which was mobilized twice. The first time was in June 1813, when Randall&#x27;s regiment—which consisted of about 300 men, equally from Stonington and North Stonington—force-marched overnight in driving rain to Groton to help defend the city against a feared landing by British naval forces. The 30th Regiment returned to the colors again in August 1814, when a squadron of British warships bombarded Stonington Borough in preparation for a raid on the town. It was during this battle that Lantern Hill obtained the nickname &quot;Tar Barrel Hill&quot;, because, in anticipation of an attack on Stonington, soldiers had moved pitch in barrels to its summit to set them alight to serve as an alarm if British forces appeared in the Sound. The flames and smoke from this hill alerted Randall and his men to react and move quickly to Stonington Point to repulse the attempted raiding party that intended to put Stonington Borough to the torch.

The 1820s and 1830s saw continued growth of Milltown as a commercial center, to include the building of two fulling mills to process the town&#x27;s prodigious wool production, as well as a tannery, an iron works, cabinetmaking shops, and multiple grain mills and stores to serve the large factory workforce. The town&#x27;s overall population rose from 2,500 shortly after incorporation to over 2,800 by the 1830s, and commercial activity during this period was facilitated by the opening in 1820 of the New London-Providence Turnpike, which today is known as Route 184.

It was also during this period that the Wheeler family accumulated much of its mercantile wealth through its stores and trading connections. Maj. Dudley Wheeler (1796–1888) was the most prominent member of the family at this time; in addition to owning two stores in town, he also was extensively involved in the wool export business and during mid-century worked out of an import-export office in New York City. Over the next century, the Wheelers left their mark on the town through a number of legacies including providing large donations to the Congregational Church and the school system. Wheeler&#x27;s son Dwight donated one of the family&#x27;s stores to become the town hall in 1904 (today this building is the Old Town Hall). Unfortunately, the impressive Wheeler home located across the street from the town hall was destroyed by fire in 1938 and never rebuilt; today the location is occupied by a parking lot.

Another leading businessman during this period was Stephen A. Main (1805–86) who like Dudley Wheeler established himself as a local businessman and mill owner before moving to New York City to work in various commercial enterprises. After the Civil War Main returned to North Stonington and bought one of Dudley Wheeler&#x27;s stores in Milltown; Main&#x27;s home today houses the North Stonington Historical Society. The commercial boom in the town was by no means limited to just a few families, and permitted the construction of many ornate homes in Milltown and elsewhere, many of which have survived to this day.

Almost as soon as the town established itself as a commercial center larger, even, than Westerly, however, it was quickly bypassed by the effects of the Industrial Revolution, which favored larger towns astride similarly larger rivers to erect huge mills. North Stonington&#x27;s population plummeted from the late 1830s as people left to work in Westerly and Norwich. By 1840 the town&#x27;s population had dropped to 2,269, and by 1870 it was down to 1,759. Adding to North Stonington&#x27;s decline in population was that an increasing number of the town&#x27;s youth were joining the wave of migrants heading west to try their fortunes on the frontier. Adventuresome townspeople had been attempting this before the Revolution—an early attempt to settle the then-wild Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania in the 1760s ended in disaster—but in the 1790s small groups began leaving to help settle new towns in upstate New York and, later, Ohio. Out-migration through the late 19th and early 20th centuries ensured that the town&#x27;s population would remain on a gradual, downward slope, despite the fact that the families still tended to be large.

===Civil War era: Last hurrah for mills===
While men from North Stonington joined several Connecticut regiments during the Civil War, the best-known of these was the 21st Regiment of Connecticut Volunteers because its &quot;G&quot; company consisted completely of North Stonington residents. The 21st, arriving in Virginia, saw its first major combat in late 1862 during the Battle of Fredericksburg, endured heavy casualties at Drewry&#x27;s Bluff in 1863, and participated in Grant&#x27;s drive on Richmond in mid- to late 1864. Attrition was so high among officers in the regiment that North Stonington resident James F. Brown, who entered the war as commander of &quot;G&quot; company, ended the war as a lieutenant colonel and commander of the regiment. William S. Hubbel, who enlisted in the regiment from North Stonington, earned the Medal of Honor for capturing a large number of Confederate soldiers while leading a small raiding party in 1864.

The Civil War created a large market for woolen products for the Army, leading to a temporary resurgence in mill activity in North Stonington. Jumping at the new commercial opportunity, Alfred Clark built a large carding factory to process wool in Burch&#x27;s Falls, costing him $34,000. The factory existed only until 1895, but the change in the community&#x27;s name to Clark&#x27;s Falls was permanent. The foundation of the old factory remains, a short distance southwest of the center of Clarks Falls, which is at the intersection of Route 216 and Clark&#x27;s Falls Road. A few other mills in Milltown (North Stonington village) and Laurel Glen survived until the early part of the 20th century.

===Rural quiet: 1870s to 1930s===
After the Civil War, the population of North Stonington—like most of rural New England—continued to dwindle, so that by 1910, after just over a century since its incorporation, the number of residents stood at only 1,100, less than two-fifths than at the town&#x27;s height during the mill era. The town&#x27;s youth continued to migrate to the big cities to earn their fortunes, or to join the wave of pioneers flocking west to settle the frontier. As people left the town, land prices steadily deflated, enabling some farmers with means to buy up large tracts throughout North Stonington and adjoining towns. One such land baron and renowned town character, Lafayette Main, amassed such large holdings through the western end of town (as well in adjoining towns) that when asked how many acres he owned, would reply, &quot;I really don&#x27;t know. I have never been over half of it.&quot; Depopulation and the growing mechanization of agriculture caused a gradual reduction in the number of farms and acreage devoted to cultivation and pasturage, which beginning in the latter half of the 19th century led to a gradual but inexorable return of the forest, to the point where today the town is largely under trees.

Some of the people who left North Stonington during this era went on to become leading citizens elsewhere in New England. Samuel Prentice, born in 1850, attended Yale University and served as Connecticut&#x27;s Chief Justice during 1913–1920. Otis Randall, born in 1860 and a scion of one of the town&#x27;s founding families, become a professor of mathematics at Brown University and was that institution&#x27;s dean during 1913–1930. Finally, Ellen Fitz Pendleton was the sixth president of Wellesley College, presiding at that institution during 1911–1936.

The Wheeler School and Library, with a building erected in 1901, offered free secondary education to town youngsters and also took in outside boarders. The library was on the second floor. In 1950, North Stonington replaced the 15 one-room schools with a consolidated school for the primary grades. Secondary students attended Stonington High for a time, then in 1956 a new Wheeler High School opened. In succeeding years a junior high and elementary school were built nearby. Today the original building still serves the town as its library.

In the early 20th century progress arrived to re-stitch the town economically with the outer world, first in 1906 in the form of a trolley line that traversed North Stonington on its way from Westerly to Norwich. The trolley line ran for 15 years, until bankrupted by the opening of the Route 2 highway for automobiles on the old Westerly-Norwich stage road. In 1933–1934 Route 184 was put through along the route of the old New London-Providence Turnpike. Its extra heavy underlayers of gravel has never required repair. For a generation this highway was the primary automobile route to Providence and Boston along the southern coast of New England.

===North Stonington and modern challenges: 1940s and beyond===

The establishment of paved highways through the town in the 1920s and 1930s laid the foundation for the rapid population growth and dramatic economic changes wrought after World War II in North Stonington and elsewhere in New London County. During the 1950s and 1960s, North Stonington became a bedroom community for the postwar defense industry and military community of southeastern Connecticut, including such companies as Electric Boat, Pfizer, and Underwater Sound Laboratory. As a result, the town added 600 inhabitants during the 1950s (with the construction of the Cedar Ridge development) and three times that amount in the 1960s (with the opening of the Kingswood/Meadow Wood development near The Village). The town became readily accessible to anywhere in late 1964, when Interstate 95 was built and two exits were opened in North Stonington. Starting in the 1970s, a number of &quot;tech parks&quot; opened in North Stonington&#x27;s southeastern corner, adjacent to I-95. The dramatic growth in the town&#x27;s population had a direct impact on the size of the school system; whereas in the late 1950s the average graduating class ran in the teens, by 1965 it had more than doubled to 42, and was 51 in 1968. School population since then has mirrored that of the town&#x27;s gradual increase, and the graduating class of 2006 was 65, although Wheeler remains one of the smallest high schools in Connecticut.

The town&#x27;s rapid residential growth led to the development in 1963 of planning and zoning restrictions and guidelines as citizens became increasingly anxious about the potential for overdevelopment destroying the rural nature of the town. Population growth in the past thirty years has continued, but at nowhere near the break-neck pace of the 1950s and 1960s; today, some residents wish to maintain the town&#x27;s rural charm and bedroom nature while others wish to boost the local economy and capitalize on area tourism to lessen the tax burden on residents. Because of its access to I-95, rural charm, and proximity to the Mashantucket casino in the adjacent town of Ledyard, North Stonington has attracted numerous would-be developers who have advanced much-needed entertainment park ideas for the town.

North Stonington residents and visitors cherish the town for its beauty and historic value. In 1983 the village was added to the National Register of Historic Places, based on 58 existing homes and other buildings from the late 18th and early 19th centuries within its environs. Two houses located elsewhere in the town, for their age and historic value, are also on the register: the homes of Luther Palmer and John Randall.

<text>Old Lyme is a coastal town in New London County, Connecticut, United States, bounded on the west by the Connecticut River, on the south by the Long Island Sound, on the east by the town of East Lyme, and on the north by the town of Lyme. The town is part of the Lower Connecticut River Valley Planning Region.

The main street of the town, Lyme Street, is a historic district with several homes once owned by sea captains. The town has had for many years a thriving art community. Its principal institutions include the Florence Griswold Museum, the Lyme Art Association, and the Lyme Academy of Fine Arts. Several seasonal beach communities are in Old Lyme, such as Point O&#x27; Woods, Hawk&#x27;s Nest, and Miami Beach. The town is named after Lyme Regis, England.

The town of Old Lyme contains several villages, including Black Hall, Laysville, Soundview, and South Lyme. The total population of the town was 7,628 at the 2020 census.

==Background and history==
Old Lyme is a community of about 7,600 permanent residents, in addition to several thousand seasonal vacationers who occupy a seaside community of summer residences. It is located on the east bank of the Connecticut River at its confluence with Long Island Sound, across the river from Old Saybrook on the west bank. Numerous examples of Colonial and Federal architecture can be found throughout the town.

The town of Lyme was set off from Saybrook (now known as Deep River), which is on the west bank of the Connecticut River mouth, on February 13, 1665. South Lyme was incorporated from Lyme in 1855, then renamed Old Lyme in 1857, because it contains the oldest-settled portion of the Lymes. Old Lyme occupies about of shoreline, tidal marsh, inland wetlands, and forested hills. Its neighbor to the north is the town of Lyme, and to the east is East Lyme. Other place names from the same root are Hadlyme, a neighborhood in the town of Lyme and the town of East Haddam, and South Lyme, a beach resort area of Old Lyme. The place name &quot;Lyme&quot; is derived from Lyme Regis, a small port on the coast of Dorset, England from which some of the early settlers immigrated in the 17th century. The picturesque Old Lyme Cemetery contains the graves of the settlers. The Duck River flows through the cemetery and into the Connecticut River at Watch Rock Park.

Lyme disease was named after the town. It was discovered in 1975 after a mysterious outbreak of what appeared to be juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in children who lived in Lyme and Old Lyme.

== Old Lyme Art Colony ==

The Florence Griswold House in Old Lyme housed an art colony for many years in the early 20th century to many prominent American Impressionist painters. The Lyme Art Colony included Childe Hassam, Edward Charles Volkert, Willard Metcalf, Wilson Irvine, and Henry Ward Ranger, among many others. These artists made Old Lyme a thriving art community, which still continues today.

The Griswold House was transformed into an art museum, the Florence Griswold Museum, or affectionately called &quot;Flo Gris&quot;, by residents of Old Lyme. Many American Impressionist paintings of the era are of subjects in and around the Griswold House and are featured in the museum, along with many other works and personal possessions of the artists who frequented there. The building of the Old Lyme Congregational Church is known for the many paintings that have been made of it, most notably by Childe Hassam.

Rogers Lake, located in the towns of Old Lyme and Lyme, is formed by a dam along Town Woods Road in Old Lyme. The lake&#x27;s surface area is . Mill Brook, Grassy Hill Brook and Broad Swamp Brook feed into the lake. The lake&#x27;s watershed is of woodland. The outlet below the dam is Mill Brook, which is a tributary of the Lieutenant River, a tributary of the Connecticut River.

Five small islands are on Rogers Lake, the largest of which has a small cottage built on it. Rogers Lake is stocked every year with brook and rainbow trout.
A street that runs along the north side of Rogers Lake is called Blood Street; it has lent its name to the town&#x27;s rowing team, the Blood Street Sculls. Rogers Lake is also bordered by Grassy Hill Road and Town Woods Road, with a small lakeside neighborhood off of Rogers Lake Trail.

===Roger: The Rogers Lake Monster===
Roger is the name given to a reputed lake monster living in Rogers Lake, a natural freshwater lake located in Old Lyme Connecticut. Like the Loch Ness Monster and Lake Champlain’s famed Champ, many locals regard Roger as pure myth while some believe in his existence, possibly being a relative of the plesiosaur, an extinct group of aquatic reptiles. While there is no scientific evidence for the cryptid&#x27;s existence, there have been over 200 reported sightings. The legend of the monster is considered a draw for tourism in the Old Lyme and Lyme areas.

Connecticut Native American tribes referred to the creature as &quot;Caca-togo&quot;.

Based on a report by the Connecticut Association of Cryptozoology (CAC), famed local artist Florence Griswold reported the very first documented sighting of Roger in 1878. According to their report, Ms. Griswold was setting up a canvas on the northeast side of the shore when she witnessed a large long-necked grey-skinned dinosaur-like creature emerge 20 feet above the surface and quickly submerge. She recounted to her family that she did not sense Roger as a threat but was merely intrigued by the beastie. For years after the incident, Florence Griswold painted Roger into several backgrounds in some of her paintings. Humored by her work, Lyme Art Academy Professor Herbert A. Strekel said, “If Picasso had his red period and Monet had his blue period, then that would have been Griswold’s Lake Monster period.”

<text>Preston is a town in New London County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Southeastern Connecticut planning region. Its population was 4,788 at the 2020 census. The town includes the villages of Long Society, Preston City, and Poquetanuck.

==History==
In 1686, Thomas Parke, Thomas Tracy, and several others petitioned for and were granted by the Connecticut General Court authority to establish a plantation seven miles square to the east of Norwich and north of New London and Stonington. Owaneco, son of the Mohegan &quot;sachem &quot;Uncas, gave a confirmatory deed for the land in 1687. In October of that same year, the town was formally incorporated as Preston, named for the English city of Preston, Lancashire.

Early trades in the area included shoemaking, metalsmithing, shipbuilding, and brickmaking.

The Ecclesiastical Society of Preston was first organized in 1698, with the first meetinghouse located in present-day Preston City. At the request of residents in the northern part of Preston (now the town of Griswold), the North Society was established in 1716. A splinter group, the Separate Church of Preston, was established in 1747 and continued until 1817. The Preston City Baptist Church (now the Preston City Bible Church) was established in 1812. The town of Griswold separated from the town of Preston in 1815.

On August 4, 1954, an Air France Lockheed L-1049C Super Constellation flying from Orly Airport, Paris, to Idlewild Airport, New York City, crash-landed in a farm field in Preston, with no casualties.

Preston has a large number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Preston City Historic District and the Long Society Meeting House.

<text>Salem is a town in New London County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Southeastern Connecticut Planning Region. The population was 4,213 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

=== Pre-incorporation ===
The area was originally inhabited by the Mohegan people. The first settlement of European origin in present-day Salem (then part of the town of Montville) was deeded in 1664. The settlers were of English origin. In the early 18th century, more settlements appeared in what was then Colchester. During this time period, the area was called &quot;Paugwonk&quot;. The small neighborhood around the Gardner Lake Firehouse on Route 354 is sometimes still referred to by that name.

Because of the remote location of these settlements and the considerable distance to churches, the people petitioned the Connecticut General Court for a new parish in 1725. It was named New Salem Parish, in honor of Colonel Samuel Browne, the largest landowner at the time, who was from Salem, Massachusetts. Recent archaeological evidence suggests that Colonel Browne owned slaves and operated one of the largest slave plantations in New England. The people of New Salem strongly supported the Patriot cause in the Revolution. Salem was the first town in the state of Connecticut to have a plantation, owned by the Browne family.

===1819 to the present===
Salem was incorporated as a town in 1819 from lands of Colchester, Lyme, and Montville. The rocky and craggy land that constituted much of the town kept the population low and new settlement at a minimum. Salem has always been a crossroads town; the old Hartford and New London Turnpike (now Route 85) was a toll road, traveled frequently by legislators during the winters of the 19th century when the Connecticut River was impassable. The Turnpike provided stage coach service until the 1890s.

====Music Vale Seminary====
Salem became a well-known location upon the founding of Oramel Whittlesey&#x27;s Music Vale Seminary in 1835. Students of the school not only learned music, but also provided self-sustenance through farming, as did most Salem households at the time. Pianos were manufactured up the Hartford and New London Turnpike about two miles (3 km) north from the seminary, at the present location of the firehouse and Maple Shade General Store. The seminary burned down and was rebuilt. However, when Whittlesey died in 1867, it was the beginning of the end for the school; when it burned down again shortly thereafter, it was never rebuilt. Today, all that remains of the seminary is a barn and a state historical marker.

====Early rural electrification in the United States====
Salem is the site of one of the first rural electrification projects in the country, at the farm of Frederick C. Rawolle Jr. Rawolle was an engineer from New York who retired at the age of 32 after he sold to a major manufacturer the patent rights of an explosive device he had invented to fracture oil wells. His net worth at this time was approximately $50,000,000, an enormous sum for the time period. He decided to settle in the remote woods of Salem and build a farm, purchasing of land between 1917 and 1924, completely surrounding Mountain Lake and Fairy Lake. This land, once called Paugwonk, had been jointly owned by a Niantic sachem named Sanhop, a Mohegan named Chappattoe and another kinsman from Uncas. The combined area became known as Fairy Lake Farm, located near the lake of the same name. Carr Pond, which today supplies water to the city of New London, was created by Rawolle in 1920 from Fairy Lake as a means of docking his boat near the turnpike.

Rawolle decided to generate his own electricity when he learned that bringing transmission lines to his farm from the city of New London, about away, would be virtually impossible. At a cost of about one million dollars, extremely expensive at the time for a single project, a hydroelectric system was completed in 1922. Airplanes flying from New York to Boston used the glimmering lights of Fairy Lake Farm as guidance. Rawolle also opened a store in New London to sell produce from the farm. This endeavor collapsed, however, when the stock market crashed in 1929 and Rawolle lost all of his money. He died in 1954; the large stone mansion he lived in at the farm is still standing at the end of Horse Pond Road, though it is abandoned.

====Hiram Bingham III and IV====
Hiram Bingham III, from Salem, was an adventurer, U.S. senator, and explorer who rediscovered Machu Picchu in Peru in 1911. He retrieved artifacts for Yale University, which in 2011 returned many items to Cusco, Peru, pursuant to an agreement with the Peruvian government. His son, Hiram Bingham IV, was the Vice Consul in Marseille, France, during World War II, and rescued thousands of Jews from death at the Nazi concentration camps. Much of the Bingham family still lives in Salem and is active in town politics and local issues. Hiram IV died in 1988, and a U.S. Postal Stamp was issued in his honor on May 30, 2006. In 2011 the Simon Wiesenthal Center produced a film tribute to Hiram (&quot;Harry&quot;) Bingham IV concerning his life-saving actions during the war.

===Salem today===

Over the decades, Salem has slowly progressed from a small and remote farming town to a bedroom community of about 4,000; in the 1990s, it was one of the fastest growing municipalities in the state. However, it is still a small town by Connecticut standards. It did not even have its own ZIP code until the mid-1990s; before then, it was shared with Colchester.

During its early years, Salem had several schoolhouses scattered throughout town, like most New England communities of the time; one is still visible on White Birch Road. Salem School was built in 1940 near the town green as little more than a large schoolhouse. Several additions have been built since then, the most recent opening in 1994. Today, Salem School is one of the largest K–8 schools in the state, with about 600 students. Students in grades 9 through 12 attend high school in the neighboring town of East Lyme; this will be the case until at least 2039
, when the current co-op agreement between the two towns expires.

Connecticut Route 85 was commissioned from the old turnpike in 1932. Traffic increased considerably over the next several decades, and the Route 11 expressway was proposed as an alternate through route. Lack of funding and bureaucratic issues caused construction to halt in 1972 in Salem at Route 82. The project was revived in the mid-1990s, and in August 2004, Route 11 was announced as a federal high priority project under President Bush&#x27;s Executive Order 13274, during a surprise visit by U.S. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta to Salem. The new highway was to be accompanied by a &quot;greenway&quot; of preserved land, a first in the nation. However, the State of Connecticut halted work on the project in 2009, citing funding issues. Most Salem residents favor completion because it would remove through traffic from local roads. Though effectively canceled, the highway project remains a frequently discussed political issue in the town.

Salem has very little commercial and industrial development, which has not kept pace with the rapid residential growth; the &quot;four corners&quot; area, at the busy junction of Route 85 and Route 82, is virtually all that exists. As a result, taxes in the town are generally high.

The last operating dairy farm in Salem, near Gardner Lake, which was an official supplier of Cabot cheese, closed in 2004, though there remains a small dairy goat farm, Syman Says Farms, that produces goat milk bath and body products.

In 2006 Salem Boy Scout Troop 123 was one of the largest in the state of Connecticut. In 2006 this troop sent more scouts to summer camp than any other Connecticut troop. Most years more than 50 percent of second grade boys are enrolled in the Salem Cub Scouts.

===Salem traditions===
Salem is host to several long-standing traditions. Some annual traditions include:
*Memorial Day Parade
*Salem 5K Road Race
*Salem Apple Festival, held at the end of October on the town green. It features everything from apple pies to apple fritters to hot dogs with apple sauerkraut. Today we also sell pies and apple merchandise across the street from the town Green. In concert with the festival, the Salem Public Library holds its annual book sale at Salem School.

==On the National Register of Historic Places==

* Abel H. Fish House – Buckley Hill and Rathbun Hill Roads (added 1982)
* Salem Historic District – state Route 85 (added 1980)
* Ebenezer Tiffany House – 460 Darling Road (added 1983)
* Woodbridge Farm – 29, 30, and 90 Woodbridge Road (added 1997)

==Salem Town Green==
As in many New England towns, Salem&#x27;s town green was originally centered around a church. The current church, Salem Congregational Church, was built in 1840. The Music Vale Seminary was about a half mile south of the green itself. The town hall, library, recreational fields, and Salem School are all located nearby. A grange and historical society are built around the green.

The green has changed little over the past two hundred years, the most changes being in the last two decades. Salem School has undergone many additions since its original construction in 1940. The townspeople in 2003 voted overwhelmingly in a referendum to build a new library, which opened in 2004. The new structure replaced the original library, a tiny structure donated by the Bingham family in 1928, which is now vacant. Also in 2004, construction began on expanded recreational fields.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 29.8 square miles (77.2 km), of which 29.0 square miles (75.0 km) is land and 0.8 square miles (2.1 km), or 2.79%, is water.

==Demographics==

The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 99.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 99.4 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $68,750, and the median income for a family was $75,747. Males had a median income of $48,173 versus $36,364 for females.

Residents in grades 9 through 12 are zoned to East Lyme High School in East Lyme, which is a part of East Lyme Public Schools.

==Miscellaneous==
There is a Witch Meadow Lake and Witch Meadow Campground in Salem, perhaps a tongue-in-cheek homage to the infamous witch trials of Salem, Massachusetts.

==History==

=== Founding ===
The first people immigrated from England in 1637 and came to the New London and Waterford area (at the time, this land was called West Farms). One of the first people who set sail for this area was John Winthrop Jr. Waterford got its name for its proximity to being in between two rivers. The residents of Waterford resided in wigwams until they dug up plots for 38 houses near the Great Neck area. Winthrop was given several hundred acres of land, including Millstone Point and Alewife Cove. Various dams, mills, and ponds were constructed in these areas. The only expansion of people in the Waterford-New London area were the growth of families and children. Later on, more people immigrated to Waterford, including Welsh, Italian, Russian, Irish, and Scottish.

Waterford separated from New London on October 8, 1801. This happened after several farmers signed a petition to separate them. The first town meeting was held in November 1801 to appoint town officials: tax collectors, town surveyors, fence viewers, and first selectman. Only the first selectman got paid at the time.

===19th century===
Waterford was a large agricultural town in the 19th century, having mostly sheep farms. Waterford was also widely known for its granite industry that lasted from the late 19th century to the 1930s. Graniteville is a district in Waterford that is named after this industry. The area today known as Crystal Mall was also home to granite quarries. Waterford&#x27;s granite was used in many construction projects such as roads, the foundation for Fort Sumter, and the Statue of Liberty. Granite was replaced by concrete which slowly shrank the granite industry until the 1930s.

===20th century===
During the 20th century, sheep farms were replaced by dairy farms. Between 1920 and 1960, there were about 100 dairy farms in Waterford. In addition, there were 10 to 100 head of cattle. Waterford also obtained its town seal in 1946. It was made by Martin Branner who was a cartoonist who also made the famous comic, Winnie Winkle.

<text>Bolton ( ) is a small rural town in Tolland County, Connecticut, United States. The population was 4,858 as of the 2020 census. Bolton was incorporated in October 1720 and is governed by town meeting, with a first selectman and board of selectman as well as other boards serving specific functions. Bolton was named after a town of the same name in England, also located near Manchester.

==History==

Originally part of the town of Hartford, the area was referred to as Hartford Mountains or Hanover, until incorporation in October 1720. On November 11, 1723, Jonathan Edwards was installed as the pastor of Bolton.

Bolton was known for its high quality schist stone in the 18th century, and many tombstone carvers such as Gershom Bartlett and Jonathan Loomis sourced their stone from Bolton quarries.

Bolton was removed from Hartford County when Tolland County was originally formed on October 13, 1785. The northern half of Bolton was set aside in 1808 to form the town of Vernon. Quarries played a significant role in the area&#x27;s developing economy, and Bolton Notch became the location of the small community of Quarryville. Prior to the railroad, granite was taken by oxcart to the Connecticut River where it was then shipped to major cities on the East Coast.

The Bolton historical society has been actively purchasing sites throughout the town in their effort to preserve the town&#x27;s history and rural character. The most recent of these purchases was Rose&#x27;s Farm, a several hundred-acre site where the Comte de Rochambeau camped with his troops.

Bolton has several restrictive ordinances designed to protect high housing prices for existing homeowners and to restrict new construction. Ordinances protecting existing businesses from competition also exist, such as those limiting the types and number of businesses. There is also a requirement that all new residential lots be no smaller than one acre, further keeping house prices artificially higher than they otherwise would likely be. The town features numerous parks, open spaces and trails.

Interstate 84 was originally planned to cut through the town on its way to Providence, going through Bolton Notch and the Hop River valley. Due to environmental concerns in both Rhode Island and in the Hop River valley, the highway would be cancelled in 1983. The segment that was built beforehand in the northwestern section of town, from CT 85 to US 6/US 44 would be redesignated at Interstate 384.

Bolton today is primarily residential with an economy made up mostly of small businesses. It is part of the Greater Hartford metro and contains many suburban homes, especially in its western side.

===Climate===

Bolton, like much of Tolland County, straddles the humid continental climate (Dfa) and (Dfb) line.

==Education==

Bolton High School is a public school with about two to three hundred students. It underwent major renovations and expansion during 2011, including a new outdoor seating area for the cafeteria, a larger and more technologically advanced library, computer labs and media center, and a new science wing and larger administrative offices. Several other improvements were made including parking, bus lanes and the board of education offices being moved to the location.

The school has a student-teacher ratio of about 12:1 and a combined math and reading proficiency level of 92.5%. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked it #27 in Connecticut and #1030 in the United States, and it earned a Silver Award in 2012.

Bolton High is affiliated with the NCCC athletic conference.

<text>Coventry ( ) is a town in Tolland County and in the Capitol Planning Region, Connecticut, United States. The population was 12,235 at the 2020 census. The birthplace of Captain Nathan Hale, Coventry is home to the Nathan Hale Homestead, which is now a museum open to the public.

==History==
Coventry was named in October 1711, the first town in the colonies to be named &quot;Coventry&quot; for Coventry in the West Midlands, United Kingdom.

===Settlement and founding===
The Middle Post Road, one of the three Boston Post Roads declared in 1671 with the creation of the Colonial post, ran through Coventry. The Post Roads were meant to connect the colony of New York, formerly New Amsterdam, with the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Middle Post Road connected Hartford and Boston, Massachusetts via Coventry and Pomfret, Connecticut, and Mendon and Roxbury, Massachusetts. Chapter 1 DOT History

The first house in Coventry was said to have been built near the shore of Wangumbaug Lake by Nathaniel Rust, a Hartford, Connecticut man, originally from Northampton, Massachusetts. The entire Rust family is said to have made their final move to Coventry from Massachusetts in a group of a dozen families in 1709. Along with Nathaniel Rust, the names of some of the earliest settlers were David Lee, Thomas Root, Samuel Gurley, Ebenezer Searl, Joseph Petty, Benjamin James and Benjamin Carpenter. Four other settlers were also from Northampton and two from Reading.

The land was said to have originally been given to men from Hartford by Joshua, Indian sachem. The Connecticut General Assembly, held in Hartford in 1706, appointed William Pitkin, Joseph Tallcot, William Whiting and Richard Lord, as a committee with full power to lay out the bounds of the town and divisions of the land, to admit inhabitants. A 1711 revision added Nathaniel Rust to the committee and the task of procuring a minister of the gospel. Coventry was formally formed as a town in Hartford County in 1712. The first church was established in October 1714.

Coventry became a town in Windham County on May 12, 1726, then became a town in Tolland County when it was originally formed on October 13, 1785.

St. Mary&#x27;s Church is a Roman Catholic church in Coventry. The church is part of the Diocese of Norwich, located at 1600 Main Street in town.

===To the present===
The old center of the town is in South Coventry, near the intersection of Main Street (Route 31) and Stonehouse Road (Route 275). In the 19th century, there was a small industrial center including mills powered by the water from Coventry Lake Brook as it flowed towards the Willimantic River. South Coventry Village, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, also includes several Victorian houses, a museum, the main branch of the public library and the Bidwell Tavern, a bar/restaurant established in 1822. The Bidwell used to keep Coventry&#x27;s town records in the &quot;vault&quot; area behind the bar, as well as hosting town meetings. A few doors away is the W.L. Wellwood General Store, which under new ownership has been renamed &quot;Coventry Country Store&quot;. The general store was originally built in 1787 making it the oldest General Store in America (a past owner claimed to have not found an older store). In all, the area has over 100 historical buildings on the national register.

North Coventry&#x27;s settlement is less dense, and its housing and businesses are of more recent construction. In the 18th century, this section of the town was largely used for dairy and vegetable farming. As the United States expanded westward, many farming families left the rocky fields of Connecticut for the more fertile land of the Ohio River valley. Most of the farms in North Coventry were abandoned, and the land reclaimed by second-growth forest. In the 1960s and 1970s, tract housing developments were built on some of this land, mainly raised ranch or split-level houses on one acre (4,000 m2) lots. Development slowed from the mid-1970s through the 1990s, but several new developments were constructed in North Coventry after 1990. These tend to feature larger houses on two acre (8,000 m2) lots. 
Coventry was incorporated in May 1712.

<text>Ellington is a town in Tolland County, Connecticut, United States. Ellington was incorporated in May 1786, from East Windsor. The town is part of the Capitol Planning Region. As of the 2020 census, the town population was 16,426.

==History==
Originally the area in what is now Ellington was named by the natives as “Weexskashuck” which translates to “Great Marsh”. The earliest settlers called the area Great Marsh or Goshen. In 1671, the town of Windsor, purchased the land of East Windsor and Ellington from the Native Americans to recover land loss from the Connecticut-Massachusetts border dispute. Though no one attempted to settle the fertile lands for another 50 years. Samuel Pinney was the first settler in today&#x27;s Ellington (Pinney Road bears his name in town). In 1733, Ellington was established as a Parish of the town of Windsor. East Windsor then split off from Windsor and held land in what is today&#x27;s East Windsor, South Windsor and Ellington in May 1768. Ellington split off twenty years later and incorporated itself in May 1786. Mostly known as an agricultural community, the Crystal Lake section of town was for a while a popular summer resort location. Ellington still has a significant amount of property dedicated to agriculture including cattle and corn farming.

Ellington&#x27;s sole representative to the voting on the adoption of the United States Constitution by Connecticut was Ebenezer Nash. Nash was an anti-federalist and voted against the ratification, which passed 128–40.

Ellington is home to one of America&#x27;s oldest roadside memorials, remembering a boy killed in a road accident. A stone in the southwest corner of the town marks the site where Samuel Knight was killed &quot;by a cartwheel rolling over his head in the 10th year of his age, Nov 8, 1812&quot;. The Christian hymn, &quot;I love to steal awhile away&quot; was written by Phoebe Hinsdale Brown in Ellington based on a personal experience in August 1818.

During the late 19th century and early 20th century, Ellington became the center of a community of Jewish immigrant farmers who were settled there by the philanthropist Baron Maurice de Hirsch&#x27;s Jewish Colonization Association. They built a synagogue, Congregation Knesseth Israel, that is still standing and in use by an active Modern Orthodox congregation today and is on the National Register of Historic Places.

On January 1, 1967, Ellington made national news when its residents assisted the city fire department in rescuing a pilot whose plane was having engine trouble and was unable to locate a runway in a fog that cut visibility to 200 feet. Under the direction and quick thinking of Resident State Trooper, Lionel Labreche, Connecticut State Police, dozens of people assembled at the town&#x27;s unlit airstrip, Hyde Field, and illuminated the runway with their headlights, allowing the pilot to land safely.

In 1991, Ellington was proposed as a potential site for a low-level nuclear waste dump. Strong dissent from area residents forced the state to abandon the plan.

As it enters the 21st century, Ellington has had the 6th fastest growth rate of all the towns in Connecticut, and has been experiencing changes in growing from a rural farming town into a suburban community. Exemplative of this change was the displacement of the locally owned Ellington Supermarket by competition from the regional Big Y supermarket chain when a new Big Y was built adjacent to the older supermarket. An independent film entitled &quot;The Supermarket&quot;, was made about the incident.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (1.59%) is water.

Ellington is bordered by the towns of East Windsor, South Windsor, Vernon, Tolland, Willington, Stafford, Somers, and Enfield.

<doc id="108849" wikidata="Q937718" url="?curid=108849" title="Mansfield, Connecticut">
<text>Mansfield ( ) is a town in Tolland County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Capitol Planning Region. The population was 25,892 at the 2020 census.

Pequot and Mohegan people lived in this region for centuries before the arrival of English settler-immigrants in the late 17th century. By 1692, English settlers put down roots in the area that is now Mansfield Center.

Mansfield was incorporated in October 1702, separating from the Town of Windham, in Hartford County. The community was named after Major Moses Mansfield, a part-owner of the town site. When Windham County was formed on May 12, 1726, Mansfield then became part of that county. A century later, at a town meeting on April 3, 1826, selectmen voted to ask the General Assembly to annex Mansfield to Tolland County. That occurred the following year.

The town of Mansfield contains the community of Storrs, which is home to the main campus of the University of Connecticut and the associated Connecticut Repertory Theatre. Villages within the town include Gurleyville and Mansfield Center, Mansfield Hollow, and Atwoodville.

==History==
English settler-immigrants arrived in the area that is now Mansfield in the late 17th century. The Town of Mansfield was legally incorporated in 1702, and the Storrs family history dates back to that time. Samuel Storrs migrated from Nottinghamshire, England to Massachusetts in 1663, then moving to the area in 1698.

The first silk mill in the United States was constructed in Mansfield and financed by Pilgrim descendant William Fisk. The town, along with neighboring Willimantic, played an important role in the manufacture of thread and other textiles. Though nothing but the foundation remains of the mill, Mansfield has held onto several other historic landmarks. A fully intact gristmill, dating to 1835, the Gurleyville Gristmill is the only one of its kind in Connecticut. Built on the Fenton River, this stone grist mill remains intact with the original equipment. There are tours available May through October. The adjacent miller&#x27;s house is the birthplace of former Connecticut governor Wilbur L. Cross, (1931 to 1939).More recent yet rare nonetheless, the Mansfield Drive-in, a drive-in movie theater, and Lucky Strike Lanes, a duckpin bowling alley, are among the last of their breed in the nation, with only 41 congress-certified alleys currently (2016), down from 450 in 1963.

The Mansfield Training School and Hospital, situated on more than and encompassing 85 buildings, was operated by the Connecticut Department of Developmental Services until its closure, after legal challenges, in 1993. Four years later, the former director and a once staunch advocate of the school declared, &quot;The Mansfield Training School is closed: the swamp has finally been drained.&quot; Since then, the site has been allowed to deteriorate, though the University of Connecticut has been slowly finding uses for and fixing up many of the buildings. The school, with its eerie overturned wheelchairs and neo-classical hospital, remains a magnet for adventurous locals, the police, and amateur photographers.

Located directly across U.S. Route 44 from the Mansfield Training School is the Donald T. Bergin Correctional Institution, which closed in August 2011. The Level 2 facility housed approximately 1,000 inmates. It served as a pre-release center for inmates who were approaching the end of their sentence or a period of supervised community placement.

On the Northeastern edge of town (Mount Hope Village), the playwright, actor and producer Willard Mack owned a large estate (originally built by William Fisk). Mack permitted his other various friends and associates to board and breed their thoroughbreds on his property. One of these, boxing legend Jack Dempsey, made continual use of these facilities until Mack&#x27;s death in the mid-1930s. During Mack&#x27;s stewardship of this property, the famous Arabian Stallion &quot;Broomstick&quot;, sire of numerous Kentucky Derby and Triple Crown winning thoroughbreds, was also a temporary resident. The property has since been purchased and maintained by private owners.

Development has increased in recent years, leading to the imposition of a temporary moratorium on new subdivisions, as well as additional land acquisition. Town-provided services, including free community wireless Internet access became available at the Mansfield Community Center, the Mansfield Town Hall, the Mansfield Senior Center, and the Mansfield Public Library in the late 2010s.

Media outlets have previously reported Mansfield to be a safe place. In 2005, &quot;Slate&quot; named Storrs &quot;America&#x27;s Best Place to Avoid Death Due to Natural Disaster.&quot;

Storrs, the largest of the town&#x27;s settlements, is an unincorporated village within Mansfield anchored economically and demographically by the main campus of the University of Connecticut. The community was named after Charles and Augustus Storrs, two brothers who founded the university (originally called the Storrs Agricultural College) by giving the land () and $6,000 to the State of Connecticut in trust in 1881. 

Due to its association with UConn and the Huskies&#x27; popular basketball programs, it has also taken on the moniker of the &quot;College Basketball Capitol of the World&quot;.

The &quot;downtown&quot; area of the village is the economic and government center of Mansfield, acting as a mixed-used community development following its construction in the mid-2000s. At the time, the goal of the redevelopment was smart growth through what the Town of Mansfield described as a &quot;livable downtown&quot;. Municipal services located there notably include the Avery P. Beck Building (town hall) and Mansfield Community Center on South Eagleville Road, and nearby EO Smith High School on Storrs Road. A number of businesses and apartment are also based in the development, including a number of special-interest stores and restaurants, in addition to some banks, offices, and a Price Chopper grocery store.

Betsy Patterson Square, an outdoor green space with sculpture installations, anchors the &quot;downtown&quot; area including and is flanked by a Barnes and Noble-operated UConn Bookstore, the Ballard Institute and Museum of Puppetry, and health service locations operated by UConn Health. The Mansfield Downtown Partnership, a town-affiliated nonprofit organization, hosts community-based events at the square.

Mansfield Center, the town&#x27;s other major village, is situated southerly and borders Willimantic. Mostly a bedroom community, Mansfield Center does include a business district which features the East Brook Mall and shopping plazas, including a Big Y supermarket. Original properties located in Mansfield Center, including a historic general store building, are listed as part of the Mansfield Center Historic District.

Both Storrs and Mansfield Center also each contain a related census-designated place.

Mansfield enjoys a moderate amount of protected open space, notably Mansfield Hollow State Park, town parks and preserves, and numerous Joshua&#x27;s Trust properties in addition to UConn-owned and maintained properties including Spring Valley Student Farm. Three large private farms operate within Mansfield, including Mountain Dairy, which has been producing and processing milk under the stewardship of one family since 1871.

==Infastructure and Transportation==

U.S. Route 6 passes through the southern end of Mansfield as an isolated stretch of divided highway, part of the planned but never realized interstate between Hartford and Providence, Rhode Island. Construction began midway between the two major cities, far removed from population centers. When opposition arose and complications developed, the project was shelved, with only stranded parts of the highway completed; the freeway portion extends from the nearby town border of Columbia and Willimantic and ends in North Windham.

The community includes the intersection of state roadways U.S. Route 44 and Connecticut Route 32 in Mansfield Depot. Route 6 has an interchange with Storrs Road (Connecticut Route 195) on the town border with Willimantic; Storrs Road runs north and intersects with Route 44 at the &quot;four corners&quot;, a colloquial name for the intersection, continuing through Coventry and Tolland to meet with Connecticut Route 74.

Willington Hill Road (Connecticut Route 320) and South Eagleville Road (Connecticut Route 275) act as major roadways to access the village from the north and south, respectively. Willington Hill Road begins in nearby Willington and merges into Storrs Road at the &quot;four corners&quot;. South Eagleville Road offers a junction to Storrs Road from Route 32 in Coventry.

===Intermodal services===
The Nash-Zimmer Transportation Center, located on Royce Circle in the &quot;downtown&quot; area, acts as a de-facto hub for intermodal services, with a parking garage and waiting room.

Local bus service is provided by the Windham Region Transit District (WRTD), with two routes that connect to local points of interest. Route 674 travels toward Willimantic, including stops at the local Big Y plaza and the East Brook Mall, and route 675 offers stops along Hunting Lodge Road toward Mansfield Depot. WRTD also operates &quot;HuskyGo&quot; shuttle service in partnership with the UConn transportation services office, which provides access to on-campus locations and stops along Storrs Road (Connecticut Route 195) for students.

Express bus service is provided by CT Transit as route 913, which travels between Storrs and Hartford. The express route makes limited stops at commuter lots in Tolland, Vernon, and Manchester connecting at The Shoppes at Buckland Hills toward Hartford Union Station. A number of runs begin and end at the Sigourney Street CT Fastrak station in Hartford.

Limited intercity bus service is provided by Peter Pan Bus Lines, who run extra routes to Hartford Union Station and to Providence, RI.

===Former and proposed services===
Until 1955 inter-city train service was available nine miles to the south at Willimantic station on the New Haven Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Nutmeg&quot; line and on trains between Waterbury, Hartford and Boston. From 1991 to 1995, Willimantic was served by Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Montrealer&quot; service. Schedules would refer to the stop as &quot;&quot;Willimantic, CT (Storrs)&quot; &quot;, owing to the stop&#x27;s close proximity to the village and use by students.

A plan for expanded passenger rail service in eastern Connecticut through to Vermont, the Central Corridor Rail Line, includes reviving service to Willimantic and the construction of a new Storrs stop. Other proposals for local and high-speed rail projects in Connecticut have included planned stops in Storrs and in nearby Tolland to service UConn.

<text>Rockville is a census-designated place and a village of the town of Vernon in Tolland County, Connecticut, United States. The village is part of the Capitol Planning Region. The population was 7,920 at the 2020 census. Incorporated as a city in 1889, it has been consolidated with the town of Vernon since 1965.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and (2.9%) is water.

==History==

===Early settlement===

In 1726, Samuel Grant traded his farm in Bolton for in the northern part of Bolton. This included the area which is now known as &quot;Rockville&quot; and for about the next century it was a nameless village. A prominent feature of the area is the Shenipsit Lake, or &quot;The Snip&quot; as it is currently affectionately called by the residents. The Snip feeds the Hockanum River which cascades 254 feet over . The river was used by the farmers for a grist mill, a saw mill, an oil mill and even a distillery starting .

===Rock Mill===

In 1821, Colonel Francis McLean built the first textile mill in what is now Rockville in partnership with George and Allyn Kellogg and Ralph Talcott, next to a spot known as &quot;the Rock&quot; with capital of $16,000. Francis McLean had partnered previously with some others in the Warburton Mill in Talcottville. &quot;The Rock&quot; was a natural dam of solid stone that made a high falls on the Hockanum River. In what is now the center of Rockville, he dammed up the Hockanum River and built a water-powered mill known as the &quot;Rock Mill&quot;, which was possibly also known as the McLean Woolen Factory. By 1823 his mill was in full operation. The new mill was 80 by 30 feet, and its product was blue and blue-mix satinet. In 1826 power looms were introduced.

The mill attracted people to this area and by 1836 the population grew to 440 consisting of 61 families including 89 children under the age of 10.

===Name===

Mail service was brought once a day by stagecoach from Vernon Center, which was the post office and place for voting for the town. In 1837, according to old records, &quot;an amateurish notice was posted on the Rock Mill announcing a public meeting in the lecture room of the village to decide in a democratic way the most suitable name for the vicinity&quot;. In order to have their own post office the town needed a permanent name.

*The following were some of the recommendations for naming the town.
**Frankfort – in honor of Francis Mclean builder of the &quot;Rock Mill&quot;
**Vernon Falls
**Grantville – in honor of Samuel Grant the first settler
**Hillborough – because the terrain is so hilly
Simon Chapman, who ran a boarding house for mill workers, submitted the name &quot;Rockville&quot; as common expression understood by the surrounding areas was &quot;Going to the Rock&quot;. Thus,
Rockville became the official name. It was not until 1842, however, that Rockville actually acquired its own post office.

==Rockville Historic District==
Most of Rockville has been designated as part of the Rockville Historic District. The district is roughly bounded by Shenipsit Street, Davis Avenue, West Street and South Street was added in 1984 to the National Register of Historic Places. The district includes 842 buildings and one other structure. It includes examples of Greek Revival, Late Victorian, and Classical Revival architecture. The historic district includes 842 buildings and one other structure over .

The Kellogg House had been used by the State Department of Children and Families to house troubled youth under a contract with Community Solutions, Inc. This arrangement ended on May 2, 2006 after a long history of documented mismanagement by both agencies. The facility is now used for adult transitional housing.

Elm Street, Park Street, and one block of Prospect Street surround a small town park named Talcott Park. The houses represent a variety of Victorian architectural styles ranging from early nineteenth century Greek Revival through the Gothic Revival and Italianate styles down to the Victorian eclecticism of the 1880s and 1890s. The mill owners usually built their houses in the downtown area.

The surviving buildings grouped around Central Park are a continuing reminder of the wealth brought by the woolen industry and the town&#x27;s aspirations to be a leading city in the state during the 19th century.

On or about November 1, 2007, the light fixtures that sat beside the library steps were stolen. Both fixtures were made of copper shaped into globes. They weighed over one hundred pounds each and were installed as part of the original construction.

*St. Bernard Church
*Memorial Building housing currently the New England Civil War Museum and the Grand Army of the Republic Hall as well as the town offices for Vernon.

The Village was given the name Wallop but was changed to East Enfield shortly after. In the year 1734, East Enfield became a town and was renamed Somers, after John Somers, 1st Baron Somers.

<text>Stafford is a town in Tolland County, Connecticut, United States, settled in 1719. The town is part of the Capitol Planning Region. The population was 11,472 at the 2020 United States Census. The community consists of the downtown area of Stafford Springs and the more rural villages of Crystal Lake, Ellithorpe, Hydeville, Orcuttsville, Staffordville, Stafford Hollow, Village Hill, and West Stafford.

==Etymology==

The town most likely derives its name from Staffordshire, in England.

==History==
The Colonial Town of Stafford began as a rural agricultural community in the eastern part of Hartford County. It became part of Tolland County upon the latter&#x27;s formation on 13 October 1785. The easy availability of water power from the tributaries of the Willimantic River led to industrialization, and this abundance of power helped generate local population growth. By the mid-19th century, Stafford was connected by railroad to markets across New England, and before the State Highway projects of the 1920s and 1930s, the town had a trolley connection to Rockville.

During the Civil War, factories in Stafford made cannonballs and other war supplies for the northern forces.

<doc id="108855" wikidata="Q166302" url="?curid=108855" title="Storrs, Connecticut">
<text>Storrs ( ) is a village and census-designated place (CDP) in the town of Mansfield in eastern Tolland County, Connecticut, United States. The village is part of the Capitol Planning Region. The population was 15,979 at the 2020 census.

Storrs is dominated economically and demographically by the main campus of the University of Connecticut and the associated Connecticut Repertory Theatre.

==History==
Storrs was named after Charles and Augustus Storrs, two brothers who founded the University of Connecticut (originally called the Storrs Agricultural College) by giving the land () and $6,000 in 1881. 
In the aftermath of September 2005&#x27;s Hurricane Katrina, &quot;Slate&quot; named Storrs &quot;America&#x27;s Best Place to Avoid Death Due to Natural Disaster.&quot;

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the community has an area of 14.9 km (5.7 mi2), of which 14.7 km (5.7 mi2) is land and 0.1 km (0.04 mi2) (0.53%) is water.

===Climate===
==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 10,996 people, 1,630 households, and 645 families residing in the community. The population density was 748.8/km (1,939.3/mi2). There were 1,701 housing units at an average density of 115.8/km (300.0/mi2). The racial makeup of the community was 81.10% White, 5.67% African American, 0.09% Native American, 9.13% Asian, 0.05% Pacific Islander, 1.70% from other races, and 2.26% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.40% of the population.

There were 1,630 households, out of which 15.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 33.6% were married couples living together, 4.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 60.4% were non-families. 34.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 16.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.19 and the average family size was 2.70.

The age distribution, heavily influenced by the University of Connecticut, was 4.0% of the population under the age of 18, 76.1% from 18 to 24, 10.1% from 25 to 44, 3.9% from 45 to 64, and 5.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 21. For every 100 females, there were 91.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 91.1 males.

The median income for a household in the community was $76,000 and the median income for a family was $64,833. Males had a median income of $34,766 versus $23,229 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $9,947. About 10.0% of families and 33.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 5.4% of those under age 18 and 8.2% of those age 65 or over. Standard measures of poverty can be misleading when applied to communities dominated by students, such as Storrs.

==Transportation==

The community includes the intersection of state roadways U.S. Route 44 and Connecticut Route 32 in Mansfield Depot. U.S. Route 6, a medium state freeway that runs through Hartford to Providence, Rhode Island, has an interchange with Storrs Road (Connecticut Route 195) on the town border with Willimantic; Storrs Road runs north and intersects with Route 44 at the &quot;four corners&quot;, a colloquial name for the intersection, continuing through Coventry and Tolland to meet with Connecticut Route 74.

Willington Hill Road (Connecticut Route 320) and South Eagleville Road (Connecticut Route 275) act as major roadways to access the village from the north and south, respectively. Willington Hill Road begins in nearby Willington and merges into Storrs Road at the &quot;four corners&quot;. South Eagleville Road offers a junction to Storrs Road from Route 32 in Coventry.

===Intermodal services===
The Nash-Zimmer Transportation Center, located on Royce Circle in the &quot;downtown&quot; area, acts as a de-facto hub for intermodal services, with a parking garage and waiting room.

Local bus service is provided by the Windham Region Transit District (WRTD), with two routes that connect to local points of interest. Route 674 travels toward Willimantic, including stops at the local Big Y supermarket and the East Brook Mall, and route 675 offers stops along Hunting Lodge Road toward Mansfield Depot. WRTD also operates &quot;HuskyGo&quot; shuttle service in partnership with the UConn transportation services office, which provides access to on-campus locations and stops along Storrs Road (Connecticut Route 195) for students.

Express bus service is provided by CT Transit as route 913, which travels between Storrs and Hartford. The express route makes limited stops at commuter lots in Tolland, Vernon, and Manchester connecting at The Shoppes at Buckland Hills toward Hartford Union Station. A number of runs begin and end at the Sigourney Street CT Fastrak station in Hartford.

Limited intercity bus service is provided by Peter Pan Bus Lines, who run extra routes to Hartford Union Station and to Providence, RI.

===Former and proposed services===
Until 1955 inter-city train service was available nine miles to the south at Willimantic station on the New Haven Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Nutmeg&quot; line and on trains between Waterbury, Hartford and Boston. From 1991 to 1995, Willimantic was served by Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Montrealer&quot; service. Schedules would refer to the stop as &quot;&quot;Willimantic, CT (Storrs)&quot; &quot;, owing to the stop&#x27;s close proximity to the village and use by students.

A plan for expanded passenger rail service in eastern Connecticut through to Vermont, the Central Corridor Rail Line, includes reviving service to Willimantic and the construction of a new Mansfield/Storrs stop. Other proposals for local and high-speed rail projects in Connecticut have included planned stops in Storrs and in nearby Tolland to service UConn.

<text>Tolland ( ) is a suburban town in Tolland County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Capitol Planning Region. The population was 14,563 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

Tolland was named in May 1715, and incorporated in May 1722 from Windsor. The town was over 20 miles away from Tolland and was incorporated to grow the population out in the hill areas. According to some, the town derives its name from being a toll station on the old road between Boston and New York. Alternatively, its name could have been taken after Tolland in Somerset, England. Today Interstate 84, the main highway connecting New York City, Hartford, Connecticut and Boston, bisects Tolland, but the town retains a charming village feel. Tolland Green is the informal center of the community, and a national historic district. The Green&#x27;s features include an old-fashioned penny candy and antiques store known to locals as the &#x27;Red and White&#x27;; the town&#x27;s original 19th-century town hall, now an arts center; the Old Tolland County Jail and Museum; the Tolland County Courthouse and former public library; the &#x27;Tolland Inn&#x27; bed and breakfast; and the Hicks-Stearns Family Museum, a restored Victorian house. The architectural styles on display, including the white steeples of several churches, are reminiscent of a picture-postcard New England scene. The town is also home to the supposedly haunted Daniel Benton Homestead, built in 1720 and the oldest house in Tolland.

Many of the town&#x27;s adults work in Hartford, located about 30 minutes away, often at one of the city&#x27;s many insurance companies, or for the University of Connecticut in Storrs, to the south. A family-oriented town, the landscape of Tolland is primarily composed of houses on plots of land around two acres. Undeveloped, forested land covers the area between the town&#x27;s many residential developments. Containing two state forests and several municipal parks, the town retains a relatively rural character.

The Tolland Public Library opened in 1899. Located in the old county courthouse until 1985, the library was moved to the former Hicks Memorial School in 1985. It was significantly expanded in 2017.

In 2006, Tolland opened the new Tolland High School to support the growing number of students. The town is also expanding with new commercial and residential developments.

Tolland has ranked among &quot;Best Places to Live in America&quot; by CNN magazine in the &quot;Small Town&quot; category several times:
In April 2008, Wes Craven began filming scenes for his 2009 movie &quot;My Soul to Take&quot; inside the former Tolland High School.

In September 2019, it was announced that Birch Grove Elementary School would undergo renovation after the foundation started to crack due to the presence of pyrrhotite in the cement. Construction is expected to complete in August 2021.

== Climate ==
Tolland&#x27;s climate is classified as warm summer continental (&quot;Dfb&quot;), as is typical of the eastern hills of Connecticut. The area enjoys some characteristics hot-summer continental climate (&quot;Dfa)&quot; due to a relatively high July mean temperature of 70.7 °F (21.5 °C), which is very close to the threshold of 71.6 °F (22 °C) mean temperature required for a hot-summer climate&quot;.&quot; The area experiences four distinct seasons, with cold, snowy winters and warm to hot summers. The climate of Tolland is distinguished from the warmer climate of nearby Hartford due to its elevation. The area is prone to blizzards and ice storms in the winter, and during the summer it occasionally experiences tropical activity (though less severe than in lower elevations of the state). Precipitation is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year, with the wettest month being November and the driest being February.

==Government==
Tolland was governed by town meeting until November 1973, when it adopted a new charter. The principal governing body of Tolland is the elected Town Council, which is responsible for making policy and major decisions about the town&#x27;s future. The day-to-day operations of the town are handled by a Town Manager, a paid professional appointed by the Council and charged with implementing and executing Council policy and decisions.

The Council consists of seven unpaid members elected in a general election in the town every two years. Currently, the Council consists of three Republicans and four Democrats, and was elected in November 2023. The council selects its own chairman and vice-chairman, with the chairman traditionally being the highest vote-getter among the four majority-party members and the vice-chairman the highest among the minority party members, though the council is not under obligation to follow this pattern. Except for Executive Sessions (which are held to renegotiate contracts with Town employees, among other reasons) meetings are open to the public and contain a time for citizens to address the Council from the floor. As of November 2017, meetings are held on the second and fourth Tuesdays of the month at 7:00pm in the 6th floor Council Chambers of the Hicks Municipal Building at 21 Tolland Green.

===Recreation===

With over 40,000 acres of forestland in and around town and a major interstate going through it, Union is known for outdoor recreation such as hunting, fishing, hiking, camping and picnicking. The area&#x27;s elevation and dominance of evergreen trees makes the area cooler than surrounding places. Most activity is centered on Bigelow Hollow State Park, and especially at Mashapaug Lake.

Snowmobiling is also enjoyed in the area.

===Landmarks===
The village of Mashapaug in Union is the site of the Traveler Restaurant, a unique eating establishment that gives away used books to its patrons.

Camp Pomperaug, a Boy Scout camp operated by the Connecticut Yankee Council, BSA, is situated within Union, and borders the state forest. It was originally property of the Wells family, for whom Wells Pond is named. The camp was originally situated on Lake Zoar in Monroe, but was relocated to the Union property when the original camp&#x27;s dining hall was destroyed by a severe winter storm.

The camp includes old stone foundations of the buildings once comprising Well&#x27;s Mill, and also includes a small Revolutionary War cemetery where, among other soldiers interred, lies a brother-in-law of Benedict Arnold. The burial site is thought by some to be haunted.

The Union Free Public Library is housed in one of the town&#x27;s few public buildings. The library was established by a town meeting in November 1894, and opened March 25, 1895, in a private home. In 1912 it moved into a newly built building, which it still occupies.

In 1720 a party of eight men, originally from England, bought 16,000 acres of the region and called it Wellington. Willington was incorporated in May 1727.

President George Washington, returning from his tour of the country in the fall of 1789, was chagrined to be involuntarily abandoned in the village on a Sunday. It was contrary to law to hire a conveyance on that day, which was observed by villagers, to Washington&#x27;s great annoyance.

New Ashford in Massachusetts is named after Ashford, as it was settled in 1762 by people from Ashford.

On July 17, 2018, an EF0 tornado—the first tornado to touch down in Windham County since 1992—struck Ashford Lake and the surrounding neighborhoods, downing trees, damaging homes, and killing three household rabbits.

Brooklyn was settled in the late 17th century and incorporated as its own town in 1786. It is named for the Quinebaug River, or Brook Line, which forms its eastern boundary. Brooklyn was originally land of the Wabaquasset. It was incorporated as a town separate from Canterbury and Pomfret in May 1786. It is home to the Brooklyn Fair, America&#x27;s oldest continuously operating agricultural fair, as well as the Brooklyn Correctional Institution, a state-run medium security prison.

Brooklyn held the 1833 trial of Prudence Crandall, a schoolteacher charged with the crime of educating black female students in nearby Canterbury.

Brooklyn is the final resting place of Revolutionary War General Israel Putnam. Though he was originally buried in an above ground tomb in Brooklyn&#x27;s South Cemetery, his remains had to be moved due to excessive visitors. In 1888, a statue of Putnam mounted on a horse was erected, and his sarcophagus placed in the foundation. The statue stands slightly south of the town green, in front of the post office. Brooklyn is also home of the Middle School Bobcats and Elementary School Bears.

<text>Canterbury is a town in Windham County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Northeastern Connecticut Planning Region. The population was 5,045 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The area was settled by English colonists in the 1680s as &quot;Peagscomsuck&quot;. It consisted mainly of land north of Norwich, south of New Roxbury, Massachusetts (now Woodstock, Connecticut), and west of the Quinebaug River, Peagscomsuck Island, and the Plainfield Settlement. In 1703 this section was officially separated from Plainfield and named The Town of Canterbury. The town&#x27;s namesake is Canterbury, England.

===Prudence Crandall&#x27;s School (1831–1834)===

In 1832, Prudence Crandall, a schoolteacher raised as a Quaker, stirred controversy when she opened the Canterbury Female Boarding School and admitted black girls as students. Prominent Canterbury resident Andrew T. Judson led efforts against the school. The Connecticut General Assembly passed a &quot;Black Law&quot;, which prohibited the education of black children from out of state. Crandall persisted in teaching, and in 1833 was arrested and kept in jail overnight.

Unsuccessful and long legal proceedings were mounted but violence by a mob of Canterbury residents forced the closure of the school in 1834. Crandall left the state and never returned. Connecticut repealed the Black Law in 1838.

In 1877 the town of Canterbury recognized Crandall, who had moved to Elk Falls, Kansas, with a small pension. Crandall, who by then was living in poverty, said that this helped improve her living condition. She died in 1890.

==Legacy and honors==
In 1995, the Connecticut General Assembly designated Prudence Crandall as the state&#x27;s official heroine because she opened the first school in the United States for black girls. The school still stands in Canterbury, operating as the Prudence Crandall Museum. It has been designated as a National Historic Landmark, and it is the leading tourist attraction in Canterbury.

In 2009 a life-size bronze statue of Prudence Crandall with an African-American student was installed in the state capital.

<text>Killingly is a town in Windham County, Connecticut, United States. Killingly is the largest town by population in the Northeastern Connecticut Planning Region. The population was 17,752 at the 2020 census. It consists of the borough of Danielson and the villages of Attawaugan, Ballouville, Dayville, East Killingly, Rogers, and South Killingly.

==History==
In 1653, the second John Winthrop, son of Massachusetts Bay Colony&#x27;s founding governor, obtained a grant of land formerly held by the Quinebaug Indian tribe and known as the Quinebaug (Long Pond) Country. The name &quot;Quinebaug&quot; comes from the southern New England Native American term, spelled variously , , etc., meaning &quot;long pond&quot;, from , &quot;long&quot;, and , &quot;pond&quot;.

The area in that grant, which is now occupied by Killingly, was first settled by English colonists in 1700. It was first called &quot;Aspinock&quot;, a word which may have come from the combination of the native term &quot;aucks&quot; or &quot;ock&quot; (the place of/where) and the name of the English settler, Lieutenant Aspinwall. When the town was incorporated in May 1708, Colony Governor Saltonstall was asked to suggest a name. Saltonstall&#x27;s ancestral manorial possessions lay in Killanslie and Pontefract, Yorkshire, hence he suggested “Kellingly” (the spelling was later altered).
During the 1830s, Killingly was the state&#x27;s largest producer of cotton goods, manufacturing textiles in mills from cotton shipped from the Deep South. By the 1930s, it was an important producer of window curtains.

<text>Plainfield is a town in Windham County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Northeastern Connecticut Planning Region. The population was 14,973 at the 2020 census. The town comprises four villages: Plainfield (south, ZIP code 06374), Moosup (northeast, 06354), Wauregan (northwest, 06387), and Central Village (west, 06332). Each village has their own respective United States Post Office and fire department. The entire town is serviced by the 860 area code.

==History==
Plainfield was incorporated in 1699 as the town of Quinebaug and renamed the following year to its current name. The present name of &quot;Plainfield&quot; is descriptive of the original town site. Plainfield proved to be an industrial heavyweight in the 19th and early 20th centuries due largely to the ability of the Moosup and Quinebaug Rivers to provide power to the different mills throughout town. The job opportunities attracted French Canadian Americans, Irish Americans, British Americans, and people from other countries during the late 19th century. Combined with the mills, Plainfield had incredible commerce for a small town because four railways from Hartford, New York, Boston, and Providence intersected within the town. There was also a highly acclaimed school on Academy Hill, which is how the present Academy Hill Road got its name. Also, the town annually has the V-J Day parade, said to be the oldest in the United States.

Sites in Plainfield that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places are:
*Central Village Historic District, a historic district
*March Route of Rochambeau&#x27;s Army: Old Canterbury Road

==Geography==
Plainfield is located at: 41.6775 N, 71.9220 W.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (1.81%) is water. From the southernmost point, Plainfield is inland of the Long Island Sound and Block Island Sound (Atlantic Ocean). Plainfield is the southernmost town of Windham County. The Quinebaug River generally forms the western border of the town. The Moosup River feeds the Quinebaug and runs across the northern portion of town.

==Transportation==
Plainfield is bisected by the Connecticut Turnpike (I-395 and CT 695) and is serviced by three exits: Lathrop Road at exit 28, CT 14A at exit 29, and CT 14 at exit 32. All exits are off the I-395 portion of the Turnpike, which runs north and south. Exit 35 off I-395 North is in Plainfield, but does not offer access to any Plainfield streets. CT 12 generally runs parallel to the west of the Turnpike, and is less than one-half mile from all three Turnpike exits.

There is no direct air, passenger rail, or navigable water access to Plainfield, although the town is serviced by the Providence and Worcester Railroad (freight only), which also parallels the Connecticut Turnpike corridor. There is limited public transport system available in the town; combined with a lack of a sidewalk and/or segregated cycle facilities network and the large area of the town, this necessitates that most transit is done by car.

Green Airport (PVD) in Warwick, RI. Nearby Amtrak passenger rail stations include New London (NLC) and Providence (PVD); both are roughly 40 minute drives. New London is also served by the Shore Line East commuter railroad, and Providence by Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Commuter Rail.

<text>Pomfret is a town located in Windham County, Connecticut, United States, with a population of 4,266 according to the 2020 United States Census. The town is part of the Northeastern Connecticut Planning Region. The town was incorporated in 1713 and was named after Pontefract in West Yorkshire, England. The land on which Pomfret stands today was purchased from Native Americans in 1686 in a deal known as the &quot;Mashmuket Purchase&quot; or &quot;Mashamoquet Purchase&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (0.64%) is water. Pomfret is bordered on the north by Woodstock, on the east by Putnam and Killingly, on the west by Eastford, and on the south by Brooklyn and Hampton.

===Villages===
Pomfret includes several villages, neighborhoods, or sections:
* Abington
* Elliotts
* Pomfret
* Pomfret Center
* Pomfret Landing

===Other geographic features===

The principal roads through the town are U.S. Route 44 (running east–west) and Routes 169 (running north–south), and 101 (running east–west).

Mashamoquet State Park and Wolf Den State Park are both located in Pomfret, near the intersection of US 44 and CT 101. Wolf Den State Park is the alleged site of General Israel Putnam&#x27;s slaying of the last wolf in Connecticut. Rocky paths connect the small cave, which is the actual wolf den with a glacially positioned boulder called the Indian Chair. Camping and cook-out facilities are available for a nominal fee.

The Air Line Trail, a former railroad bed, joins the town of Pomfret with its neighbor to the east, Putnam. The Airline Trail runs seven miles (11 km), much of it through an Audubon Society property named the Bafflin Sanctuary, a nature preserve.

Pomfret has no formal town center due to the town&#x27;s significant southward expansion after its establishment, first around Mortlake, later absorbing that town. The town office is located on US Route 44. The Congregational Church, until its destruction by fire on December 7, 2013, stood on the eastern edge of the old town green on Pomfret Hill, across from the Pomfret School, a college preparatory school founded in 1894. Approximately one mile north of the Congregational Church site is Christ Episcopal Church, which contains several windows designed and constructed by Louis Comfort Tiffany. Across from Christ Church on the west side of Route 44 is the Rectory School, founded in 1920. At the divergence point of US 44 and CT 169 is Most Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church.

Town House Road is the location of the historic Pomfret Town House, built in 1841 at a location chosen by a committee of Selectmen from neighboring towns when Pomfret citizens could not agree on a location; it is listed on the National Register. Pomfret First Church was established in today&#x27;s Pomfret Hill area; Pomfret Second Church covered what is largely today&#x27;s Town of Brooklyn; while Pomfret Third Church was established in today&#x27;s Abington area.

<text>Putnam is a town in Windham County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Northeastern Connecticut Planning Region. The population was 10,214 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Putnam, originally known as Aspinock, then part of Killingly, is a New England mill town incorporated in 1855. Created from sections of Killingly, Pomfret, and Thompson, the town was named in honor of Revolutionary War General Israel Putnam.

Putnam was a key contributor in providing clothing and other goods to the Civil War soldiers. There were numerous mills and a train ran through the town, providing transportation for the goods being produced.

On August 19, 1955, Putnam was devastated by floods from torrential downpours caused by two hurricanes, which hit Connecticut within the span of a week. Hurricane Connie affected Connecticut on August 13, dropping between four and six inches (152 mm) of rain across the state. Hurricane Diane soaked the state with of rain on August 18–19. The result was flooding in many of the state&#x27;s rivers, including the Quinebaug River. The resulting torrent of water destroyed homes, businesses and factories. Floating magnesium barrels burst, lighting up the night. The railroad bed was washed away.

Toward the end of the twentieth century, the town took advantage of the empty mills and underutilized downtown commercial buildings to develop a large antique center. Antique shops lined Main Street and other areas in town. Beginning in the early 2000s, many of the antique stores begun to close and were replaced by restaurants, small shops, and a vibrant arts community.

Putnam was also the unlikely base of operations for the All-Russian Fascist Organization, a pre-war Russian emigre group that advocated fascism for the country under Anastasy Vonsiatsky.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 20.4 square miles (52.8 km), of which, 20.3 square miles (52.6 km) are land and 0.1 square mile (0.3 km) (0.54%) is water. The town is drained by the Quinebaug River, which runs north and south through the center of town. A tributary of the Quinebaug, the Five Mile River, runs north and south through East Putnam. Putnam has common boundaries with Thompson on the north (approx. 6 mi.), with Rhode Island on the east (approx. 2 mi.), with Killingly on the south (approx. 7 mi.) and with Pomfret and Woodstock on the west (approx. 4 mi.).

The town is crossed by Interstate 395, U.S. Route 44, Connecticut Route 12, Connecticut Route 21 and Connecticut Route 171.

=== Bradley Playhouse ===
Originally called the Bradley Theatre, the Bradley Playhouse was completed on January 29, 1901.

<text>Thompson is a town in Windham County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Northeastern Connecticut Planning Region. The town was named after Sir Robert Thompson, an English landholder. The population was 9,189 at the 2020 census. Thompson is located in the northeastern corner of the state and is bordered on the north by Webster, Massachusetts and Dudley, Massachusetts, on the east by Douglas, Massachusetts and Burrillville, Rhode Island, on the west by Woodstock, Connecticut, and on the south by Putnam, Connecticut.

Thompson has the highest-banked race track (Thompson Speedway Motorsports Park, a 5/8 mile oval and a restored 1.7 mile road course) in New England. This speedway holds one of the biggest race programs in New England, &quot;The World Series of Auto Racing&quot;, where 16 divisions and about 400 cars show up each fall. Another claim to fame is that the Tri-State Marker is located just on the border of Thompson. The term &quot;Swamp Yankee&quot; is thought to have originated in Thompson during the American Revolution in 1776. In colonial times, the town was the site of an Indian village, known as Maanexit.

Also in town are several private schools, the Catholic St Joseph&#x27;s School, currently serving grades Pre-K–8, and Marianapolis Preparatory, a Marian high school located on historic Thompson Hill.

The original Tourtellotte Memorial High School building, which exists today as administrative offices for the school system, was built in the Greek Revival style. The cornerstone was laid in 1907 and the school opened in 1909. The school is named in memory of Dr. Jacob F. Tourtellotte. Tourtellotte was a ship&#x27;s surgeon in the U.S. Navy during the Civil War.

It is maintained by the local historical society, and is usually open to the public for tours one Sunday per month.

Marianapolis Preparatory School was established in 1926, sponsored by the Congregation of Marians of the Immaculate Conception. The school is located on the former Ream Estate, built by Norman Bruce Ream, a Director of The Pullman Company, U.S. Steel, and The National Biscuit Company, which is now known as Nabisco. The Estate, including the mansion &quot;Carolyn Hall,&quot; named after Ream&#x27;s wife, was sold to the Marians in 1931, but the Mansion burned down in 1964 and a new main school building was built in its place.

<doc id="108879" wikidata="Q754864" url="?curid=108879" title="Wauregan, Connecticut">
<text>Wauregan is a village located in the northwestern corner of the town of Plainfield, Connecticut, United States. Originally a mill village, Wauregan was established around a cotton mill powered by the Quinebaug River. Wauregan and West Wauregan, across the Quinebaug in the town of Brooklyn, together comprise the Wauregan census-designated place, with a population of 1,205 at the 2010 census.

A portion of the original village area is listed as a historic district, the Wauregan Historic District, encompassing structures that are directly related to the economic and social activities of the mill. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Extant buildings in the Wauregan historic district include the Wauregan Mill, an H-shaped building built from local fieldstone; James Atwood&#x27;s home; the two boarding houses; the company store; and over one hundred workers&#x27; houses. Architectural styles represented include Greek Revival and Late Victorian architecture.

==History==
Named for a Mohegan word meaning &quot;Pleasant Valley&quot; Wauregan has a long history as an industrial village. In 1850, Amos D. Lockwood, who was involved with the Quinebaug Mill in Danielsonville, bought the water privileges and surrounding land at Wauregan. After the Wauregan Mills Company charter was approved by the Connecticut legislature in 1853, the first mill was constructed circa 1853-1854. Wauregan Mills was well known for its woven cotton goods, including various types of flannel. Lockwood became the mill&#x27;s first agent and recruited James S. Atwood as his superintendent, who became responsible for setting up all machinery and starting production. The principal product of Wauregan was cotton sheeting.

James S. Atwood, who purchased the mill from Lockwood in 1858, took particular interest in the village surrounding the mill, making it what he considered to be a &quot;model hamlet&quot; where his factory&#x27;s employees &quot;could find attractive and comfortable homes near their daily tasks.&quot; Under James S. Atwood&#x27;s leadership, Wauregan began to prosper. The mill was expanded, workers&#x27; houses were built, and several amenities to Wauregan village life were added. Worker housing in the village included 104 company-owned buildings containing 255 tenement apartments for rental to workers, plus two boarding houses for unmarried workers. A railroad station was built in 1859 and a post office was established in 1860. A company store was built in 1875 and operated with subsidies from the company. Another building in the mill village housed a firehouse, clubhouse, jail, and a reading room and library. A dairy farm and nearby woodlands were also part of the mill operation. Atwood quadrupled the size of the factory, adding the south mill of the front block in 1859 and the entire rear block in 1867-68. The mill&#x27;s labor force was around 750 people, with most living within the village. The mill would eventually reach a capacity of 56,616 spindles and 1,464 looms, with an annual output of eleven million yards.

When James S. Atwood died, management of Wauregan Mills was passed on to his twin sons, James Arthur and John Walter Atwood. The Atwood brothers continued to expand and improve the mill, which employed 325 men and 160 women and children as of 1917. The Atwood brothers successfully responded to the competition of the newer, steam-powered mills by producing finer quality cotton goods such as shirting for the U.S. Marine Corps, and later rayon, instead of the traditional cotton sheeting. Wauregan Mills had a close working relationship with DuPont and was one of the pioneers of synthetic fabric. This partnership led to the development of the technology to produce fabric made of a blend of wool and rayon. In contrast to many larger, corporate-owned mills that were wedded to a particular product, the economic organization of Wauregan Mills enabled its owner/managers to easily diversify and change its product mix to meet new demands resulting from competition from newer textile centers, allowing them to stay profitable through World War II, much longer than many other larger mills.

After World War II, Wauregan Mills entered a period of decline from which it never recovered. In the 1950s, free trade policies with Japan, which had modern equipment shipped to them by the U.S. as part of post-war reconstruction enabling them to produce fine cotton goods much more cheaply, resulted in the death of the New England textile industry as cheap cotton goods flooded the U.S. market. Wauregan Mills tried to emphasize their capabilities in synthetic blend output and also to reduce labor costs by negotiating with the labor unions to eliminate certain fringe benefits. In August 1955, torrential rains from Hurricanes Connie and Diane caused many dams along the Quinebaug River to break, including the one at Wauregan. The mill was flooded to the level of the first floor ceilings. Workers tried to salvage as much cloth, raw materials and machinery as they could but ultimately the company lost more than $1,500,000. The company borrowed a large sum of money in order to be able to resume production but they didn&#x27;t have enough working capital to repair and modernize their facilities. In 1957, James Arthur Atwood III, grandson of James S. Atwood, and the rest of the company directors decided to cease all operations resulting in the company&#x27;s final closing.

James Arthur Atwood III was responsible for disposing of the company&#x27;s assets to pay off their creditors. Land, the water company, and other properties were sold, and the mill rented to various tenants over the next decade. American Standard was one of the early buyers and built a manufacturing facility in Wauregan soon after the Wauregan company closed. All the debts of Wauregan Mill were eventually paid off in 1970. In 1974, C&amp;M Corporation, a vertically integrated manufacturer of electrical cable, owned and occupied the former Wauregan Mills complex, where it operated as a production facility and as its corporate headquarters. In 2014, the Wauregan Mill was sold to a real estate management company. 

The village is described as looking &quot;much as it did in the 1850s.&quot; The Wauregan Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

==Geography==
The village is centered on the former site of the mill on the east bank of the Quinebaug River, near where modern Route 205 crosses the river. The village extends eastward from the river up a gently rising slope towards Route 12 located at the crest of a ridge. The mill workers&#x27; houses are located along Walnut and Chestnut streets just east of the mill site, while the supervisor&#x27;s houses and the company store are located further east (and further up in elevation). The mill owners&#x27; houses and the church are even further up and east. The historic district covers an area of about , roughly bounded on the east by Grove Street, Fountain Street, Route 12, Route 205, and South Chestnut Street; on the south by Third Street; on the west by South Walnut Street, a westward extension of First Street, and the Quinebaug River; and on the north by the extension of the east-west portion of North Chestnut Street. The boundaries of the historic district exclude a large tract of open land to the north that the Wauregan company once owned. The district includes 114 buildings and structures.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Wauregan CDP has a total area of , of which , or 1.25%, are water. The CDP includes, in addition to the original village, the village of West Wauregan across the Quinebaug River in the town of Brooklyn, as well as tracts of open land to the north, newer residential development to the south, and modern commercial properties along Route 12.

<text>Willimantic is a census-designated place located in Windham, Connecticut, United States. Previously organized as a city and later as a borough, Willimantic is currently one of two tax districts within the Town of Windham. Willimantic is located within Windham County and the Southeastern Connecticut Planning Region. Known as &quot;Thread City&quot; for the American Thread Company&#x27;s mills along the Willimantic River, it was a center of the textile industry in the 19th century. Originally incorporated as a city in 1893, it entered a period of decline after the Second World War, culminating in the mill&#x27;s closure and the city&#x27;s reabsorption into the town of Windham in the 1980s.

Willimantic was populated by a series of ethnic groups migrating to the city to find work at the mills, originally Western European and French Canadian immigrants, later Eastern Europeans and Puerto Ricans. Architecturally, it is known for its collection of Victorian-era houses and other buildings in the hill section, the Romanesque Revival town hall and several crossings of the Willimantic River, including the Willimantic Footbridge and the &quot;Frog Bridge&quot;. It is home to Eastern Connecticut State University and the Windham Textile and History Museum. As of 2020, Willimantic had a population of 18,149 people.

==History==

Willimantic is named for the Willimantic River which passes through it. The word was first attested in English writing as &quot;Waramanticut&quot; in 1684, and later as &quot;Wallamanticuk&quot;, &quot;Wewemantic&quot; and &quot;Weammantuck&quot; before being standardized as &quot;Willimantic&quot;. The word is of Algonquian origin, either Mohegan-Pequot or Narragansett. It is commonly translated as &quot;land of the swift running water&quot;, but the word more likely means &quot;place near the evergreen swamp&quot;. The town of Willimantic, Maine, is named after Willimantic, Connecticut.
The surrounding town of Windham was founded in 1693 on land bequeathed by the Mohegan people. The first settler in what is now Willimantic was Samuel Ashley, who bought property there in 1717. Until it was industrialized, the area was called &quot;Willimantic Falls&quot;. The first mill to be established was a picking and carding facility for wool, in 1806. Other mills followed, most notably a series of thread mills starting in 1822. As the city grew, it was incorporated as a borough in 1833. Willimantic became known as &quot;Thread City&quot; for the proliferation of textile mills, primarily thread, along the river.

Willimantic became a city when its charter was revised in 1893. Up to the outbreak of World War II, it continued to be a center for the production of silk and cotton thread. Various groups of immigrants arrived over the years to work in the mills. The city was a major rail hub; in the early twentieth century, as many as a hundred trains ran through Willimantic daily. Ornate Victorian homes were built in the town&#x27;s Prospect Hill section, and the town prospered, growing from a population of less than 5,000 in 1860 to more than 12,100 by 1910.

But hard times followed; American Thread moved to North Carolina in 1985 and without it, the town&#x27;s economy foundered. The city consolidated back into the town in 1983. The poverty rate, at 25.9%, was more than double the state average in 2010.

Heroin use, present since the 1960s, became a major public health problem in the early 2000s, declining somewhat by the 2010s. In 2002, &quot;The Hartford Courant&quot; ran an investigative series called &quot;Heroin Town&quot; describing rampant heroin use in Willimantic, disproportionate to the town&#x27;s small size, which was followed by a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; segment in 2003. The coverage upset local residents, and the state appointed a task force to study the issue. The Hotel Hooker, long known for drug use and prostitution, was renamed to the Seth Chauncey Hotel and put under new management in 2004, then renamed Windham House in 2005. Drug and prostitution arrests peaked in the late 2000s with increased enforcement, and began to fall by 2010.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the census-designated place (CDP) has a total area of , of which is land and (2.23%) is water. The Willimantic River and the Natchaug River converge to form the Shetucket River in southeastern Willimantic. The Hop River also flows into the Willimantic River at the western border.

Willimantic is, in part, bordered by rivers. Its western border follows the Willimantic River; its eastern border is formed by the Natchuag and Shetucket Rivers. The CDP borders the towns of Coventry, Mansfield, Columbia, and Lebanon. It also borders the CDPs of South Windham (which is in the same town as Willimantic) and Mansfield Center.

==Demographics==
Immigrants of many national origins populated the city. First, Europeans arrived to work in the mills—Irish, Italians, Poles, Germans and French Canadians. Later, Estonian, Ukrainian, Latvian, Lithuanian, and Puerto Rican immigrants moved to the town in search of mill jobs. As a mark of how strongly newcomers identified with their places of origin, Willimantic has many churches, even several from the same denomination: for example, one Catholic church for French Canadians, another for Irish, Polish and Italian immigrants.

As of the 2010 US Census, there were 17,737 people, 5,812 households, and 3,324 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 6,282 housing units at an average density of .

The racial makeup of the CDP was 66.0% White, 7.5% African American, 0.6% Native American, 1.9% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 20.2% from other races, and 3.8% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 39.8% of the population, of whom the majority are (26.4%) Puerto Rican.

Of the 5,812 households, just over one third (34.2%) included children under the age of 18, 30.6% were married couples living together, 20.2% had a female householder with no spouse present, and 42.8% were non-families. About 31.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.9% of households were one individual aged 65 or older. The average household size was 2.58 and the average family size was 3.21.

In the CDP the population&#x27;s age distribution was 21.5% under age 18, 31.0% from 18 to 24, 24.8% from 25 to 44, 19.0% from 45 to 64, and 8.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 26.5 years. For every 100 females, there were 97.3 males. For every 100 women ages 18 and over, there were 95.8 men.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $37,469, and the median income for a family was $45,254. Males had a median income of $37,111 versus $33,862 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $18,441. About 23.7% of families and 25.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 38.4% of those under age 18 and 9.3% of those age 65 or over.

The Willimantic urban cluster is an area surrounding the CDP, which has a population of 29,669 as of the 2010 census.

==Economy==
Willimantic&#x27;s first factory was built in 1822 on Main Street by Charles Lee, followed by the first of the Jillson Mills in 1824. The Jillson Mills were bought in 1854 by a group of investors from Hartford, who formed the Willimantic Linen Company. In 1879, the Company built a woodworking factory to source its spools in Howard, Maine, which was renamed Willimantic in 1881. In 1880, the Willimantic Linen Company built its Mill No. 4, the first industrial building designed for electric lighting and the world&#x27;s largest cotton mill at the time, which stood until it was burned down by two teenagers in 1995. The company was acquired by American Thread Company in 1898, and expanded production. The mill closed when the company moved operations to North Carolina in 1985.

Major employers include Willimantic Waste Paper Company, which specializes in the collection and recycling of fiber products, scrap metal, and co-mingled plastic refuse, as well as Brand-Rex Corporation, which maintains a manufacturing making specialty wire and cable for commercial and industrial customers. In January 2018, a fire destroyed the Willimantic Waste Paper processing plant, however it was rebuilt and is currently operating. On July 26, 2021, Casella Waste Systems purchased Willimantic Waste Paper Company.

== Points of interest ==

Willimantic is home to a wealth of Victorian-era architecture. Prospect Hill Historic District is a National Register-listed historic district containing 993 buildings. Windham Town Hall, formerly Willimantic City Hall, is a Romanesque Revival building housing the town offices for Windham and Willimantic.

The Windham Textile and History Museum preserves and presents the history of the neighboring Jillson Mills and the rest of Willimantic during the Industrial Revolution. The Connecticut Eastern Railroad Museum, located where the Columbia Junction Freight Yard was, has a collection of locomotives and rolling stock, as well as a reconstructed six-stall roundhouse.

Willimantic is the home of the Willimantic Footbridge. Built in 1907, it is the only footbridge in the United States to connect two state highways, as well as crossing all three major forms of transportation: road, rail, and river. The Thread City Crossing (&quot;Frog Bridge&quot;) is a road bridge over the Willimantic River, opened to traffic in September 2000, featuring eight-foot high, green-painted bronze frogs sitting on concrete thread spools to represent Willimantic&#x27;s history in textiles as well as the local legend of the Windham Frog Fight of 1754.

== Culture ==

Willimantic holds a Boom Box Parade every 4 July where, instead of a marching band performing, residents bring boom boxes tuned to WILI, the local AM radio station. The tradition started on Memorial Day of 1986, when no marching band was available for a parade. The parade has received national attention from the &quot;Washington Post&quot;. For Valentine&#x27;s Day, it runs a chocolate festival, including a baking contest. The event started with a popular set of T-shirts first printed in 1980, which led to the first crowning of a &quot;Town Cupid&quot; in 1982, now an annual event.

Once a year, the Willimantic Victorian Neighborhood Association offers tours of homes in the Prospect Hill Historic District as part of a &quot;Victorian Days&quot; event.

Starting in 2002, on the third Thursday of each month from May to September, the town holds the Third Thursday Street Fest on Main Street, an arts festival with live music and street vendors. The event is run by Willimantic Renaissance, a local nonprofit organization, and draws about eight thousand attendees.

==Education==

Willimantic is served by Windham Public Schools, which administers public schools in Willimantic as well as in the rest of Windham. Willimantic itself has a public preschool, the Windham Early Childhood Center, as well as Sweeney Elementary and Natchaug School for primary education, Windham Middle School for middle-school education, and Windham High School for high-school students. Middle-school students can also apply for admission by lottery to the Charles H. Barrows STEM Academy in Windham.

Additionally, Willimantic contains the Arts at the Capitol Theater Performing Arts High School, administered by EASTCONN, and Windham Technical High School, part of the Connecticut Technical High School System. There is also a private Christian school, St. Mary-St. Joseph School, serving Pre-K through eighth grade.

Eastern Connecticut State University, a four-year liberal arts college, is located in Willimantic, as is a satellite campus of Quinebaug Valley Community College.

==Government==
Before it was re-incorporated into Windham, Willimantic had a series of mayors; the Town of Windham was administered by a board of selectmen until 2009, when it changed to use a town council/town manager system with an elected mayor. As part of Windham, it is part of Connecticut&#x27;s 2nd congressional district; in the Connecticut Senate, the 29th district, and in the Connecticut House of Representatives, most of it is in the 49th district, with some western parts in the 48th district.

Willimantic was the county seat of Windham County from 1893 to 1960, when the county system was abolished. The Windham Judicial District building is in downtown Willimantic as well.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Transportation ===
Willimantic is served by several state routes: Route 14, Route 32, Route 66, Route 195, and Route 289. It is additionally served by the Willimantic Bypass (US 6), a controlled-access highway. Notably, the only connections to the outside world are via surface roads, as the Willimantic Bypass is only divided between its two intersections with Route 66. In the 1960s, Interstate 84 was intended to connect Willimantic to Hartford in the west and Providence in the east, but the plan was eventually abandoned. Though the city was a major rail hub, Interstate 84 only skirted the area between 1970 and 1983, until plans to continue the highway eastward were scrapped by 1984, after which time U.S. 6 was moved to the Willimatic Bypass.

Public transportation in Willimantic is provided by the Windham Region Transit District, which provides two in-town routes, and three intercity routes to Norwich, Danielson and Storrs. Historically, Willimantic was also served by intercity trolley service: from 1903 to 1936, a line ran southeast to Norwich, and from 1909 to 1926, another ran northwest to Coventry. Both lines ended at the downtown railroad yard, but did not physically connect, as they did not cross the tracks.
In the 19th century, three active rail lines passed through Willimantic: the Central Vermont Railway in 1849, running from New London in the south northward to Vermont, the Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad (later purchased by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad) in 1849, running east-to-west, and finally a line of the New York and New England Railroad, running from Boston in the northeast towards New York via Middletown and New Haven in the southwest, in 1872, which also was acquired by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. Willimantic was one of only a handful of stops between Boston and New York on the high-speed &quot;White Train&quot; of the 1890s. At its peak, the passenger rail system ran forty trains a day through Willimantic. The NH operated the Nutmeg and several unnamed local trains on an east–west route from Waterbury, through Hartford and Willimantic, and on east to Boston. These rail services ended in 1955 after a bridge was flooded out by Hurricane Diane.
Currently no active passenger rail service stops at Willimantic station, though formerly Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Montrealer&quot; stopped at the city from 1991 to 1995.

Windham Airport (IJD), a nearby general aviation airport, is the only airport that directly serves the CDP. Bradley International Airport (BDL) in Windsor Locks is the closest commercial airport.

The Airline Trail South crosses the Willimantic River to enter Willimantic on a 2016 built path that ends at Bridge St. The Airline Trail North starts on Jackson St. across the street from Jillson Park, the trail then goes through the northeastern part of Willimantic before crossing the Natchuag River to leave the CDP and heading on to Putnam. The Hop River Trail enters Willimantic on CT 66 (crossing over the Willimantic River) shortly before departing to follow the river to the Airline Trail, where it ends.

=== Utilities ===
Electricity and gas service is provided by Eversource. Municipal water and sewer services are provided by Windham Water Works.

=== Healthcare ===
Windham Hospital, a subsidiary of Hartford HealthCare, is a 130-bed community hospital serving the area. The Veterans Administration also runs an outpatient primary-care facility on Main Street. Generations Family Health Center, a Federally Qualified Health Center, is also located on Mansfield Avenue.

==Media==
Willimantic is served by &quot;The Chronicle&quot;, a local paper founded in 1877 with continuous service since then, which also serves other towns in Eastern Connecticut.

Two commercial radio stations serve the Willimantic area: WILI AM 1400 (with a translator station to 95.3 FM), a news/talk/sports station, and its sister station WILI-FM 98.3, a top 40 station. Eastern Connecticut State University also broadcasts WECS, the local NPR affiliate, on FM 90.1.

In 2007, writer-director A.D. Calvo filmed portions of his debut film, &quot;The Other Side of the Tracks&quot;, in Willimantic, and in 2011, he returned to film the majority of his third feature, &quot;House of Dust&quot;, on the campus of Eastern Connecticut State University and various other locations in town.

In Marvel Comics &quot;&quot;, Mantis recounts raising her son, Sequoia, in Willimantic for a year. One of her fragmented manifestations would later return and be found by a clone of Thanos.

<text>Windham ( ) is a town in Windham County, Connecticut, United States. It contains the former city of Willimantic as well as the communities of Windham Center, North Windham, and South Windham. Willimantic, an incorporated city since 1893, was consolidated with the town in 1983. The town is part of the Southeastern Connecticut Planning Region. The population was 24,428 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the region was occupied by Algonquian peoples, including the Pequot, Mohegan, Narragansett, and Nipmuck. After the conclusion of the Pequot War in 1638, the Pequots ceased to exist as a tribe; after King Philip&#x27;s War ended in 1678, the Narragansett and Nipmuck did as well, leaving the Mohegans the only native power in the region. The settlement of Windham was left to settlers by Joshua Uncas, son of Uncas, in a will dated 1675. Settlers moved in, and held their first town meeting on May 18, 1691. The tract was named the town of Windham in May 1692, and was incorporated into Hartford County in fall of 1693.

Starting in the early nineteenth century, the town&#x27;s center of activity moved from Windham to Willimantic, as the water power available there led to the establishment of factories. First established as a borough in 1833, it was incorporated as a separate city in 1893, then reincorporated into the town of Windham in 1983 as its industry declined.

<text>Woodstock is a town in Windham County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Northeastern Connecticut Planning Region. The population was 8,221 at the 2020 census.

==History==

===17th century===
In the mid-17th century, John Eliot, a Puritan missionary to the Native Americans, established &quot;praying towns&quot;, where Native Americans took up Christianity and were expected to renounce their religious ceremonies, traditional dress, and customs. One praying town, called Wabaquasset (Senexet, Wabiquisset), six miles west of the Quinebaug River in present-day Woodstock, was the largest of the three northeastern Connecticut praying towns.

In 1675, when King Philip&#x27;s War broke out, some of the town&#x27;s Indians, (especially in the southern part of the town) sided with the Mohegans and the English while others sided with the Indians led by Philip, rallying to arms on what is now Curtis Island in present Holland, Massachusetts and Brimfield, Massachusetts. During the war, the Praying town became deserted, and the English with their Indian allies marched through Woodstock to present day Thompson in the summer of 1676 burning any crops or stored corn they could find.

In 1682, Massachusetts bought a tract of land, which included Woodstock, from the Mohegans. A group of 13 men from Roxbury, Massachusetts (home of the Pastorate of Woodstock&#x27;s earlier visitor, John Eliot), settled the town in 1686 and named it New Roxbury. Judge Samuel Sewall suggested the town change its name to Woodstock in 1690, citing its proximity to Oxford, Massachusetts, and in 1749 the town became part of Connecticut. The present name is after Woodstock, in England.

===18th and 19th centuries===
A farming town in the 18th century, Woodstock began attracting industry after the War of 1812. &quot;By 1820, there were 2 distilleries, 2 wheel wrights, an oil mill, fulling mill, carding machines, grist mills, saw mills, a goldsmith, and twine and cotton batting operations. Woodstock Valley was known for its shoe factories,&quot; according to the history page at the Woodstock town government Web site.

By the middle of the 19th century, industry almost ceased, and Woodstock reverted to a rural state. The town then became a summer destination for wealthy city dwellers from around the East coast of the United States.

Henry C. Bowen was critical to this development. Bowen was a Woodstock native who became wealthy through the dry-goods business and publishing in Brooklyn, New York. He also founded the anti-slavery newspaper &quot;The Independent,&quot; helped found the Republican Party, and headed the lay managers of the famed Plymouth Church. Bowen had built a home in Woodstock and invested heavily in the improvement of his home town. Other lay leaders of Plymouth Church would summer with him, including Henry Ward Beecher, the church&#x27;s pastor; Frederick Hinrichs, whose descendants still live in Woodstock; the Holt publishing family; the Tappans; and Albert Lythgoe, an Egyptologist renowned for pioneering the use of scientific methods in the unearthing of antiquities.

Bowen hosted July 4 celebrations in Woodstock at his Roseland Park during the latter part of the 19th century. These festivities attracted as many as 10,000 people who heard speeches, saw fireworks, and drank pink lemonade. Bowen, often called &quot;Mr. Fourth of July,&quot; eventually gave Roseland Park, which included a man-made lake, to the community.

Several U.S. Presidents visited Bowen&#x27;s summer home on Woodstock Hill: Ulysses S. Grant, Benjamin Harrison, and Rutherford B. Hayes, as his guests and speakers for Fourth of July celebrations. Grant visited while he was a sitting president. Grant spent a night there in spite of the fact that Bowen (a teetotaler) forbade drinking and smoking in his home (Grant was made to smoke his cigars out on the porch, and he drank covertly). Hayes arrived for the July 4 celebration of 1883, and gave a speech in support of national education aid. Benjamin Harrison arrived in the first year of his presidency, planting a liberty tree during the 4th of July celebration. Other prominent visitors were Henry Ward Beecher and John C. Fremont.

===Roseland Cottage===
Roseland Cottage, also known as the Pink House or the Bowen House, was a summer home built by wealthy businessman Henry C. Bowen in 1846. This is where Bowen hosted U.S. Presidents for his then-famous Independence Day celebrations at Roseland Park. Ulysses S. Grant bowled his first strike in the bowling alley located in the carriage barn.

The pink-colored house features &quot;tall, angular gables, gingerbread trim, and 21 formal flower gardens outlined by dwarf boxwood hedges,&quot; according to a Hartford Courant article. Roseland is an example of Victorian Gothic Revival style, which can be seen in its pointed gables, scrolled bargeboards, many tall chimneys, and leaded glass windows in diamond shapes. The outside walls, of board and batten wood siding, have been painted 13 different colors over the past 150 years—all shades of pink. As of the summer of 2006, the house was a coral or salmon color. The house still includes the owners&#x27; original furniture and knickknacks.

Roseland was designed (under Bowen&#x27;s direction) by architect Joseph C. Wells. The design was influenced by the design books of architectural critic Andrew Jackson Downing.

Fine Homebuilding magazine named Roseland one of the 25 most important houses in America in its 2006 Fine Homebuilding Houses Annual Issue.

Roseland Cottage was purchased by Historic New England in 1970 and is currently open to the public for tours.

Dr. Francis Baran is the Superintendent. Woodstock Elementary School serves children in pre-Kindergarten through fourth grade. Enrollment exceeded 500 as of 2006. Woodstock Middle School, acquired in 1996, has an enrollment of more than 400 in Grades 5–8.

The town has an &quot;Independent New England Academy&quot; (a special public / private school governed by a 30-member Board of Trustees) called Woodstock Academy.

From 1941 to 1980, Woodstock was home to Annhurst College, a private, Catholic institution.

===Woodstock Academy===

Woodstock Academy, a &quot;New England Academy&quot; which is a corporate school (there are two others in the State; Norwich Free Academy and The Gilbert School) and is governed by a 30-member Board of Trustees, is located in Woodstock. Founded in 1801 as a New England Academy, Woodstock Academy briefly closed twice in the 19th century, and the second time was revived by local philanthropist and Academy graduate Henry C. Bowen. After Bowen&#x27;s death, his family set up an endowment fund to help keep the school running. In 1915 it became designated the town of Woodstock&#x27;s public high school. In 1932 Eastford, a nearby community, also designated it as its town high school. From 1915 until 2004 the Town of Woodstock had officially designated the academy as its public high school. Since then the town&#x27;s Board of Education and the Academy Trustees have been unable to come to an agreement, although Woodstock continues to send its students to the academy for its high school.

Today the school serves the towns of Woodstock, Eastford, Pomfret, Union, Canterbury, and Brooklyn with a student population of over 1100. The school is often described as &quot;independent&quot; as it is not controlled by any of the municipalities that it serves or by a regional high school board.

Presently the Woodstock Board of Education is in the process of negotiating a new contract with the school, but negotiations have been at an impasse these last two years as the Woodstock Board of Education has been trying to get more financial control over Woodstock Academy, a school which, as of 2009, is administered by itself with oversight by the state of Connecticut.

Bowers Beach was originally settled in the late 1600s and was named Whitwell&#x27;s Delight by Francis Whitwell. The land was acquired by William Frampton in 1685 and was called Dover Peers. After Frampton died, the land was sold to William Bassett. Eventually, 420 acres of Whitwell&#x27;s Delight belonged to Nathaniel and Mary Hunn. After Nathaniel Hunn died in 1734, his children sold the land to John Bowers and the land along the Delaware Bay between the St. Jones River and Murderkill River became known as Bowers Beach starting on August 16, 1734. The land later belonged to John Bowers&#x27; son and then his granddaughter, with the latter being the last person in the Bowers family to own the land. Part of the land was acquired by John Booth in 1750, who sold it later in the year to Benjamin Chew. By the 1800s, the properties in Bowers Beach were owned by Joseph Wood.

<text>Camden is a town in Kent County, Delaware, United States. It is part of the Dover metropolitan area. The population was 3,715 in 2020.

==History==
Camden was established in 1783 as a community originally known as Mifflin&#x27;s Crossroads. The community of Mifflin&#x27;s Crossroads was a Quaker settlement laid out by Daniel Mifflin on the Piccadilly tract. The town originally gained some commercial trade through wharves in nearby Forest Landing and Lebanon on the St. Jones River. From these wharves, regular boat service connected the area to Philadelphia and New York City, with local merchants shipping cordwood, staves, grain, and Spanish-oak bark. The Delaware Railroad was built through nearby Wyoming in the 1850s and expanded the market for local farm products, bringing increased prosperity to Camden. The town has numerous historic properties and part of it is designated as the Camden Historic District. In addition, Brecknock, Camden Friends Meetinghouse, Star Hill AME Church, and Zion African Methodist Episcopal Church are all listed individually on the National Register of Historic Places.

On February 22, 1975, a vote was held to merge with the bordering town of Wyoming; the residents of Camden voted 117 to 49 in favor of merging the towns, but the measure failed when Wyoming residents voted against the measure by a similar proportion in reverse: 113 against to 78 in favor. The Wyoming town council had previously opposed a merger attempt in 1967.

==Geography==
Camden is located at (39.1134458, –75.5418687).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

Because of the small size of this town, and its even smaller neighbor of Wyoming, the U.S. Postal Service has jointly assigned the towns a single ZIP code, 19934, which is designated as the Camden-Wyoming ZIP code.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Camden has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Frederica is a town in Kent County, Delaware, United States. It is part of the Dover metropolitan area. The population was 1,073 in 2020. ILC Dover, the company which manufactured the spacesuits for the Apollo and Skylab astronauts of the 1960s and 1970s, along with fabricating the suit component of the Space Shuttle&#x27;s Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU), is located nearby.

==History==

The present-day town of Frederica was part of a land grant to Boneny Bishop by William Penn in 1681. The location at a bend along the Murderkill River was originally known as Indian Point and later became known as Johnny Cake Landing. The waterfront was surveyed in 1758 and the area where most shipping activity occurred became known as Goforth&#x27;s Landing.

The remainder of the town was surveyed and laid out by Jonathan Emerson in 1772. In 1796, the community was renamed from Johnny Cake Landing to Frederica Landing at the request of one of Emerson&#x27;s daughters, as she believed the name Johnny Cake Landing was a rather unceremonious, informal name and inappropriate for a settlement close to Barratt&#x27;s Chapel, a major landmark for Methodism. (See Johnnycake.) The Town of Frederica was incorporated by the state in 1826. The incorporation act for Frederica was repealed in 1855, only for the town to be reincorporated in 1865.

Frederica was built along the Murderkill River at a point it was still navigable, from the Delaware Bay. The town was surrounded by wetlands, leading to the nickname &quot;Frogtown&quot; for the large number of frogs that live in the wetlands. Frederica developed as a shipping and shipbuilding center due to its location along the navigable Murderkill River; shipping and shipbuilding would dominate the town&#x27;s economy for several decades. The town was linked by water to other Kent County towns along with the city of Philadelphia, and its fortunes depended on its water connections to these places as roads were often impassable at the time. Important cargo shipped along the Murderkill River in Frederica&#x27;s early history included bacon, beef, corn, wheat flour, cedar shingles, cheese, butter, tar, pitch and hardwood boards.

In 1857, the Delaware Railroad was constructed across the state, leading to a decline in Frederica&#x27;s status as a major shipping center. The railroad brought improved transportation across Kent County, diverting the shipment of goods away from the river ports. The shipping interests in Frederica fought against the construction of the Delaware Railroad near the town, which stopped the growth of the town and increased the isolation of Frederica from other towns. The Delaware Railroad was built well to the west of Frederica through Dover and Felton. The town later attempted to get a railroad connection by chartering a railroad line that would run from Dover to Milford via Frederica as well as pushing for a branch of the Delaware Railroad from Felton to Frederica; both efforts were unsuccessful.

The last shipyard in Frederica closed around 1890, but other industries would become prominent in Frederica. By 1887, the town had three canneries, with other businesses such as fertilizer manufacturing, a hat factory, two brush factories, a cooper, a butcher, a hotel, a clothing house, and ten general stores. A steamship operated by the Frederica and Philadelphia Navigation Company linked Frederica with Philadelphia until the onset of the Great Depression. In the 1920s, improvements to U.S. Route 113 that included a causeway into Frederica cut the town off from the Delaware Bay. Improved roads in the 20th century would provide better connections with Harrington, Dover, and Wilmington, reducing the need for the steamship to Philadelphia. Maritime activity in Frederica declined, the port quieted down, and the canneries and many businesses in the town closed. U.S. Route 113 was rerouted to bypass Frederica to the east along what is now Delaware Route 1. Today, Frederica is a quiet town that has not experienced much change unlike many places in the United States.

The Barratt Hall, Barratt&#x27;s Chapel, Bonwell House, Frederica Historic District, and Mordington are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Harrington Raceway has been the home of a harness racing meet for over 75 years.

In 2004, Rainbow Blue and 2015 Wiggle It Jiggleit both received that distinguished title of Horse of the Year and in 2019, Shartin N accomplished the impressive feat. Many other horses from the 19952 ZIP code have received divisional honors and throughout 2019, the aforementioned Shartin N was ranked the #1 horse in the country, prior to winning top honors. Amidst Shartin&#x27;s ascent, yet another Harrington horse, Lather Up, was making headlines as he equaled harness racing&#x27;s all-time fastest time of 1:46 in July 2019 at the Meadowlands Racetrack in New Jersey. Coincidentally, Lather Up was stabled 4 miles to the east of Harrington Raceway at George Teague Jr&#x27;s farm, while Shartin N&#x27;s training base was 4 miles west of the racetrack at the farm of Jo Ann Looney and Jim King Jr. The town&#x27;s rich harness racing history dates back to the 1950s when Adios Harry was named aged pacer of the year and was one of the town&#x27;s first nationally recognized horses. He was even on the cover of the July 23, 1956 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, with the headline, Adios Harry: World&#x27;s Fastest Pacer! In 2021, yet another horse hailing from Harrington was making headlines - as Lyons Sentinel was ranked the #1 in the country as of October 5.

The town post office contains a wax tempera mural, &quot;Men Hoeing&quot;, painted in 1941 by Eve Salisbury. Federally commissioned murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department.

In 2015, the town of Hartly had no functioning government after fatigue had hit the Town Council about three years earlier and many members did not return to their posts. As a result, the town government could not pay bills, collect taxes, enforce codes, or apply for state aid. The town had not collected taxes for two years and was in thousands of dollars of debt. As a result, the town needed to reform its government or unincorporate and be governed directly by Kent County. A meeting was held in January 2015 at the Hartly Volunteer Fire Company on reforming the town government. The meeting was attended by about 150 people, of which 16 lived in the town of Hartly and could run for office.

<text>Milford is a city in Kent and Sussex counties in the U.S. state of Delaware. According to the 2020 census, the population of the city is 11,190 people and 4,356 households in the city.

The Kent County portion of Milford is part of the Dover, DE Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden, PA-NJ-DE-MD Combined Statistical Area, while the Sussex County portion is part of the Salisbury, MD-DE Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The Kent County side of Milford was first settled in 1680 by Henry Bowan on what was known as the Saw Mill Range. A century later the Reverend Sydenham Thorne built a dam across the Mispillion River to generate power for his gristmill and sawmill. Around the same time, Joseph Oliver laid out the first city streets and plots nearby on a part of his plantation. Soon a number of homes and businesses appeared along Front Street. The city was incorporated February 5, 1807.

In the 1770s, a ship building industry was already flourishing on the Mispillion River. Shipbuilding continued to be the major industry of Milford through World War I, bringing considerable prosperity to the town. The high point came in 1917 when the four-masted, long &quot;Albert F. Paul&quot; was launched from the William G. Abbott shipyard. At one point six shipyards were operating in the downtown area. When the last of the area&#x27;s giant white oaks was cut in the 1920s, the shipyards quickly went out of business, although the Mispillion ships sailed on for many years. (The &quot;Paul&quot; was sunk by a German torpedo in 1942 while sailing from the Bahamas.) The Vineyard shipyard was called into service in both World War I and II to build submarine chasers.

During much of the twentieth century Milford served primarily as the commercial center for much of southern Delaware&#x27;s large agricultural community.

Seven of Delaware&#x27;s governors have come from Milford: Daniel Rogers (who served 1797–99), Joseph Haslet (1811–14), William Tharp (1847–1851), Peter F. Causey (1855–59), William Burton (1859–63), William T. Watson (1895–97), and Ruth Ann Minner (2001–09).

Abbott&#x27;s Mill, Bank House, Carlisle House, Christ Church, Dr. Dawson House, Draper House, Egglinton Hall, Golden Mine, Grier House, Peter Lofland House, James McColley House, Milford New Century Club, Milford Railroad Station, Milford Shipyard Area Historic District, Mill House, Mispillion Lighthouse and Beacon Tower, North Milford Historic District, Old Fire House, Parson Thorne Mansion, South Milford Historic District Walnut Farm, Gov. William T. Watson Mansion, and J. H. Wilkerson &amp; Son Brickworks are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

On Friday, May 30, 2003 at approximately 3:00 p.m. a fire started in a second floor apartment next to Wiley Hardware &amp; Appliance on Walnut Street in the historic downtown section of Milford. More than 200 firefighters from Milford, Ellendale, Harrington, Felton, Dover, Smyrna, Houston, Frederica, Slaughter Beach, Bowers Beach, Greenwood, South Bowers, Farmington, Magnolia, Cheswold, Lewes, Georgetown, and Bridgeville in Delaware and Greensboro and Goldsboro in Maryland fought the blaze which destroyed seven businesses, a church, and three apartments, destroying an entire city block in the historic section of town. No one was killed in the blaze, but one civilian and six firefighters were injured.

After the shipping industry collapsed in the 1850s, the town would continue to be an agricultural center.

Another account of Smyrna&#x27;s name goes back to the Second Great Awakening of 1806–1807 when Methodist preacher Frances Asbury preached a sermon on the Church at Smyrna from Revelation 2 to the local Methodist society. The sermon was so well received that the residents changed the name of the town to Smyrna in honor of the sermon.
