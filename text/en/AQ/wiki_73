<text>Tell City is a city in and the county seat of Troy Township, Perry County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. It is located along the Ohio River. The population was 7,506 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Tell City traces its 150+ year old roots to a meeting in Cincinnati, Ohio in November 1856. A group of Swiss-German immigrants met in Cincinnati to organize a society known as the &quot;Swiss Colonization Society.&quot; The society&#x27;s purpose was to obtain affordable homesteads for mechanics, shopkeepers, factory workers, and small farmers in a location where all could live in harmony.

The Society decided to purchase a tract of land three miles (5 km) square to be surveyed as a city plot. The group was sent out to purchase the land and told to keep in mind they should find a healthful climate, fertile soil, good water, ample timber, as well as a location near a navigable river and a railroad, if possible. Purchase of a suitable site was made in July 1857. The tract, containing , was laid out in 392 town blocks with 7,328 building lots and 294 garden lots.

Before the settlers arrived, a name for the new town was selected. Initially called Helvetia, it was soon renamed Tell City, a name easier to pronounce and remember for English-speaking people. It was named for the legendary Swiss hero and liberator, William Tell.

Indicative of the foresightedness of Tell City&#x27;s founders are the wide streets. They are named for great persons of the military, arts, letters and science: DeKalb, Watt, Winkelried, Steuben, Payne, Herrman, Reubens, Lafayette, Schiller, Tell, Fulton, Jefferson, Mozart, Franklin, Humboldt, Pestalozzi, Washington, Blum and Gutenberg.

The Tell City post office has been in operation since 1858.

With 100 years of recorded history, the citizens of Tell City held a centennial celebration August 10–17, 1958 in honor of the early settlers and the founding of Tell City. After the success of the Centennial, the Tell City Historical Society decided they would sponsor a festival in 1959 to determine if the community would support it as an annual event. The festival, named Schweizer Fest (Swiss Fest), was a great success. Today, the festival remains one of Indiana&#x27;s longest-running community festivals.

On March 17, 1960, Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 710, a Lockheed Electra turboprop airliner flying from Chicago to Miami lost a wing due to aerodynamic flutter and crashed in southern Indiana near Tell City. All 63 on board, including the crew, perished. The victims were impacted in a crater, which became their final resting place. A monument with the names of the victims and the date of the tragedy marks the grave.

Tell City became the county seat in 1994, when it was moved from nearby Cannelton.

===Steamboat &quot;Tell City&quot;===

The steamboat &quot;Tell City&quot; was built in 1889 and named after Tell City. It was used to carry passengers and freight on the Ohio River until it sank on April 6, 1917 in Little Hocking, Ohio. The pilothouse survived the sinking and is the oldest remaining steamboat pilothouse, located at the Ohio River Museum in Marietta, Ohio.

<text>Beverly Shores is a town in Pine Township, Porter County, Indiana, United States, about east of downtown Chicago. The population was 613 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Beverly Shores began life as a planned resort community. The Chicago, Lake Shore &amp; South Bend Railway began to provide service from South Bend to Chicago shortly after 1900. The Chicago businessman Samuel Insull reorganized the line as the Chicago, South Shore &amp; South Bend (today&#x27;s South Shore Line) in 1925, upgrading the stations and encouraging tourism. A number of promotional posters were issued, many of which remain in print.

The Frederick H. Bartlett Company, at that time one of Chicago&#x27;s largest real-estate developers, bought in the area in 1927, and plotted thousands of homesites. He named the prospective development Lake Shore, North Shore Beach and South Shore Acres. The Great Depression dampened its prospects, and many of the plots were never built on.

Robert Bartlett, Frederick Bartlett&#x27;s brother, purchased the properties in 1933. He named the entire development after his daughter Beverly, and continued to develop its infrastructure with roads, a school, a golf course, and a hotel. He purchased and relocated sixteen structures from Chicago&#x27;s 1933-34 Century of Progress World&#x27;s Fair, four of which were transported by barges on Lake Michigan.

The community was incorporated in 1947. After World War II, a number of industrial developments, including Burns Harbor, were built to the west, and by the 1950s environmental organizations had begun to push for preservation of the area. The Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore was established in 1966. During the 1970s, there was a movement to purchase all the homes in Beverly Shores and incorporate the entire town into the National Lakeshore. This initiative did not succeed, but many local properties were acquired, especially those in the wetlands that constitute the southern portion. The acquisition process is ongoing. The owners of lots fronting on the beach were granted lifetime leasebacks with the proviso that the property would revert to the National Lakeshore; many of these houses have since been demolished.

The 1970s saw a period of record high lake levels and beach erosion; the owners of lakefront properties often responded by dumping large quantities of concrete blocks (riprap) onto the sand in front of their houses, which continue to mar the beach. The beach is now conspicuously public, although nearby parking is limited.

A resurgence of development took place during the 1990s and 2000s, when many million-dollar-plus houses were built on the dunes near the lakefront. In the early 2000s, excessive levels of arsenic, boron, lead, and manganese were found in wells in the nearby town of Pines, and pipelines delivering Lake Michigan water treated by Michigan City were extended into Beverly Shores. This time period also saw explosive growth of the local white-tailed deer population, a problem that has polarized its residents.

In 1998, the Spanish Colonial Revival train depot, originally built in 1929, was reopened following a historic renovation. The restored train depot now also houses a museum, displaying historic photographs and memorabilia, and a gallery, featuring rotating exhibits of local art.

Easily accessible from Chicago, Beverly Shores is a second home to many Chicagoans who are referred to locally as some-timers. Both full-time and some-time residents come together for community activities such as ice skating on the frozen pond during Winterfest, the 5k Necktie Race held on Father&#x27;s Day, and the annual summertime event the Fireman&#x27;s Ball which raises money for the volunteer fire department.

Beverly Shores has always enjoyed the reputation of being a &quot;gay-friendly&quot; community. Along with the acceptance of gay culture, Beverly Shores has long been a haven for artists.

Beverly Shores attracts many visitors, particularly nature enthusiasts, cyclists and bird watchers, who come to enjoy the beaches and the marshlands. Overnight lodging options are limited but visitors who wish to stay the night can reserve a campsite at Dunewood Camp.

On June 24, 2014, the International Dark-Sky Association announced Beverly Shores as the world&#x27;s seventh international dark sky community.

<text>Chesterton is a town in Westchester, Jackson and Liberty townships in Porter County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 14,241 at the 2020 Census. The three towns of Chesterton, Burns Harbor, and Porter are known as the Duneland area.

==Etymology==
The name Chesterton comes from its township, with Chester deriving from Westchester and the -ton suffix denoting it as a town.

==History==
Chesterton was first settled under the name Coffee Creek in 1833, with its post office being established in 1835. The post office would eventually be renamed to Calumet in 1850, as which the town was platted when the railroad was extended to that point in 1852. Due to a town on the same railroad also being named Calumet, the name would finally be changed to Chesterton in 1870 and it was reincorporated as a town in 1899 after a failed incorporation in 1869, with its population of 788 being the second-largest in Porter County at the time.

In 1933, a United Airlines NC13304 flight became the first known, proven case of sabotage in an aircraft. It was downed by a nitroglycerine bomb above Chesterton on October 10, 1933. All 7 people aboard the aircraft—four passengers and a crew of three—were killed in the crash.

In 1962, United Tractor moved to the town.

==Geography==
Just north of the town is Indiana Dunes State Park and Indiana Dunes National Park. Most of the town is flat. However, going south into the city on the Route 49 overpass, one can see the Valparaiso Moraine in the distance.

==Transportation==

In the past, Dune Acres was served by the eponymous station on the South Shore Line, which was located at Mineral Springs Road. That station was closed in 1994 as part of NICTD&#x27;s effort to consolidate the line&#x27;s Porter County stations. Since then, the community has been served by the Dune Park station. V-Line&#x27;s Orange Line route stops at the station Friday-Sunday, allowing Dune Acres residents to connect to Valparaiso (and vice versa). Coach USA&#x27;s &quot;Tri-State/United Limo&quot; Service stops at the nearby town of Portage, providing a direct connecting to Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare Airport.

Dunes Highway (U.S. Route 12) is the closest highway to Dune Acres. The closest airport is located in western Gary, and the closest Amtrak station is located further northeast in Michigan City.

<text>Hebron is a town in Boone Township, Porter County, Indiana, United States. The population was 3,755 as of the 2020 census.

==History==
The first settler to Hebron was Judge Jesse Johnson (1st Judge of the Porter County Probate Court. The area of Hebron was an open prairie interspersed with small groves of trees. The prairie was about long by wide. About south was the Potawatomi village of Hauakiki. Locally the village was called &quot;Indian Town.&quot;

The area chosen for settlement was referred to as &quot;The Corners&quot; as this was where two roads crossed. Hebron was laid out in 1841. The first homes were of log construction. In 1849, Mr. McCune built the &quot;Tavern&quot; as the first frame structure. The tavern continued in use as a tavern until 1936. In 1838, a Rev. Hannan organized the Bethlehem Church of Associate Reform Presbyterians. Later the church changed its name from &quot;Bethlehem&quot; to &quot;Hebron.&quot; In 1845, Rev. Blain of the Hebron Church of Associate Reform Presbyterians petitioned for a post office named after his church. The post office was established that year and the town got its name.

In 1849, 1852, 1855, and 1864 lots were laid out to the west and south of &quot;The Corners.&quot; It took the construction of the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad in 1863 to open the town to growth. Completed just to support the Union effort during the American Civil War, the railroad spurred growth after the war ended. Hebron became a gateway to the rich hunting grounds of the Grand Kankakee Marsh.

The community was granted status as a &quot;Town&quot; on March 5, 1890. The advent of the draining of the Grand Kankakee Marsh in 1890 increased the traffic and the population of the entire area. Another spurt of growth occurred from 1900-1912 when the Hebron Opera House was built. By 1936, three passenger trains a day passed through Hebron headed for Chicago, making access to world markets possible.

The Eli Sigler House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.

<text>Kouts is a town in Pleasant Township, Porter County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 2,028 at the 2020 census. Since 2010, Kouts has had a population growth of 7.90 percent.

==History==
Bernhardt Kautz moved here from Pennsylvania, before the arrival of the railroads, and established a farm where the town now sits. With the arrival of the Chicago and St. Louis Railway in 1865, Kautz and his brother-in-law H.A. Wright laid out the town and established a store. Known as Kouts Station, the town grew slowly until the Chicago and Erie Railroad intersected the line in Kouts. Soon, Kouts became the social and economic center of the township.

===Railroads===
Kouts would remain an important railroad town throughout the first half of the 20th century continuing to be served by the Erie Lackawanna Railway and the Pennsylvania Railroad. Railroad traffic in the town began to decline following the bankruptcy of the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s successor, the Penn Central and the creation of Conrail. As the also bankrupt Erie Lackawanna would similarly be absorbed into the new company in 1976. The surplus of Conrail track through Kouts would lead to a decline in both traffic and profitability. The passage of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 allowed for U.S railways to abandon unprofitable lines, which Conrail would take advantage of in Kouts. First with the Erie Lackawanna tracks in 1981 and then the Pennsylvania tracks in 1984. Currently there are little remnants of Kouts railroading past except for the former Pennsylvania Railroad depot which has been converted into a private business.

<text>Ogden Dunes is a town in Portage Township, Porter County, Indiana, United States. It is located on the shore of Lake Michigan, within Indiana Dunes National Park and nearly surrounded by the city of Portage. The population was 1,168 as of the 2020 census. It is named for multi-millionaire Francis A. Ogden, who owned the land there before his death in 1914. His main interest in the land where the dunes are was the sand which could be scooped up and sold, with more sand being replenished naturally over time.

Many residents of Ogden Dunes helped preserve parts of the Indiana Dunes.

The town is the site of the Portage / Ogden Dunes station, which is served by South Shore Line passenger trains to and from Chicago. The principal thoroughfare serving the town is U.S. Route 12, which passes along the town&#x27;s southern edge and connects it to nearby communities such as Gary to the west and Burns Harbor to the east.

Ogden Dunes has been reported as having the highest rate of Lyme disease in Indiana.

==History==
Samuel Reck purchased the land from the estate of Francis Ogden in 1923. The town was platted a year later. The town had 50 residents in 1930. By the 1950s, there were almost 800 residents and 1,000 in 1991. The town was incorporated in 1925 to establish long term right of way across the New York Central Railroad tracks. The developers planned to create a resort community with a golf course, clubhouse and hotel. As development lagged, plans were dropped. Sand roads served the community until cinders placed on main street in 1931.

In the later 1920s Ogden Dunes was noted for having the largest ski jump in the country. International skiing competitions were held on this 30-story high, 500-foot long slide until it was dismantled in 1932. In 1927, the Grand Beach Ski Club, later the Ogden Dunes Ski Club, bought a piece of land on one of the high dunes in the town. They constructed a -tall ski jump. The first meet was held on January 22, 1928. For the next four years, meets were held in Ogden Dunes. The longest jump ever reported on this structure was 195 feet. In 1932, the Norwegian Olympic Team of Birger Rund, Hans Beck, and Kaare Wahlberg (gold, silver, and bronze medalists) came to Ogden Dunes to try the tower. During the Great Depression the Ski Club had financial setbacks; combined with little snow, the club looked to sell the tower.
*In 1935, a ski club in Rockford, Illinois, purchased the tower and moved it that summer. The Rockford Ski Club built ski jump at along the Kishwaukee River (Rockford Rotary County Forest Preserve) near the end 1920&#x27;s. It was expanded in 1936 by adding the steel inrun tower from Ogden Dunes. 
*Moving the tower was repeated a third time in 1955 when the tower was moved to Eau Claire, Wisconsin and erected at Hendrickson Hill along the Chippewa River in what is now the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire Campus. In 1968-69 Hendrickson Hill the hill was abandoned and the steel tower was once again dismantled and reassembled in its new location at Silver Mine Hill, downstream on the Chippewa River. The ski jump is still used at this site.

Two early houses (11008,11009) on Ski Hill Road are simple yet stylish homes built on the steep and lovely wooded hills of Ogden Dunes. Later structures along the beach include two outstanding houses (11001, 11004), which reflect the area&#x27;s emergence as a fashionable and exclusive residential area in Porter County.

<text>Valparaiso ( ), colloquially Valpo, is a city in and the county seat of Porter County, Indiana, United States. The population was 34,151 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Chicago metropolitan area.

==History==
The site of present-day Valparaiso was included in the purchase of land from the Potawatomi people by the U.S. Government in October 1832. Chiqua&#x27;s town or Chipuaw was located a mile east of the current Courthouse along the Sauk Trail. Chiqua&#x27;s town existed from or before 1830 until after 1832. The location is just north of the railroad crossing on State Route 2 and County Road 400 North.

Located on the ancient Native American trail from Rock Island to Detroit, the town had its first log cabin in 1834. Established in 1836 as &quot;Portersville&quot;, county seat of Porter County, it was renamed to Valparaiso (meaning &quot;Vale of Paradise&quot; in Old Spanish) in 1837 after Valparaíso, Chile, near which the county&#x27;s namesake David Porter battled in the Battle of Valparaiso during the War of 1812. The city was once called the &quot;City of Churches&quot; due to the large number of churches located there at the end of the 19th century. Valparaiso Male and Female College, one of the earliest higher education institutions admitting both men and women in the country, was founded in Valparaiso in 1859, but closed its doors in 1871 before reopening in 1873 as the Northern Indiana Normal School and Business Institute. In the early 20th century, it became Valparaiso College, then Valparaiso University. It was initially affiliated with the Methodist Church but after 1925 with the Lutheran University Association (which has relationships both with the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, and with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America) and expanded significantly after World War II.

From the 1890s until 1969, there were no African-American residents in Valparaiso. This has been attributed to Valparaiso being a sundown town. There was also substantial activity by the Ku Klux Klan, which negotiated to purchase Valparaiso University in 1923. The first African-American family to move to Valparaiso faced intimidation and eventually left the city when a visiting relative was murdered. In recent years, the city&#x27;s racial composition has diversified.

Valparaiso also has a long history of being a transportation hub for the region. In 1858, the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad reached Valparaiso, connecting the city directly to Chicago. By 1910, an interurban railway connected the city to Gary, Indiana. Today, while the city no longer has a passenger train station, it is still very much a part of the &quot;Crossroads of America&quot; due to its proximity to I-65, I-80, I-90, and I-94. Additionally, the Canadian National railroad still runs freight on the tracks, including through the downtown area.

Until 1991, Valparaiso was the terminal of Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Calumet&quot; commuter service.

==Geography==

The city is situated at the junctions of U.S. Route 30, State Road 2, and State Road 49.

According to the 2010 census, Valparaiso has a total area of , of which (or 99.69%) is land and (or 0.31%) is water.

===Topography===
The city is situated on the Valparaiso Moraine.

Glaciation has left numerous features on the landscape here. Kettle lakes and knobs make up much of this hilly area of Northwest Indiana. The Pines Ski Area is the only remaining kame in the city; the other one is under the university&#x27;s Chapel of the Resurrection, however, grading of land in that area makes that particular kame almost nonexistent. Many glacial erratics can be found throughout the city. The moraine has left the city with mostly clay soil.

==Media==
===Newspapers===
Valparaiso is served by two regional newspapers:
* &quot;The Times of Northwest Indiana&quot; (or NWI Times), was founded in 1906 and is the second largest of Indiana&#x27;s 76 daily newspapers. It is based on Munster.
* The &quot;Post-Tribune&quot; of Northwest Indiana was founded in 1907, serving the Northwest Indiana region. The Post-Tribune is owned by Tribune Company and is based in Merrillville.

===Magazines===
&quot;North Valpo Neighbors&quot; and &quot;South Valpo Neighbors&quot; are published in Valparaiso.

===Radio===
The primary local radio stations are WLJE 105.5 FM &quot;Indiana 105&quot;, which broadcasts country music, WAKE 1500 AM, which plays adult standards, and WVLP 98.3 FM &quot;ValpoRadio&quot;, a non-profit, low power FM community radio station. Valparaiso formerly had a fourth local station, WNWI 1080 AM, which relocated to Oak Lawn, Illinois in 1998 and is now a Chicago-market station. Radio is usually from the Chicago market.

==Infrastructure==
Valparaiso gets all of its water from wells that draw water from depths between 90 and . The supply is treated with chlorine solution to remove the iron. Valparaiso also has three sewer retention basins.

Valparaiso&#x27;s energy is provided by NIPSCO. The Schaeffer Power Plant is located south of Valparaiso, in Wheatfield.

A city bus service, the V-Line, was founded in 2007. It operates between downtown, the university, shopping centers, the city&#x27;s northern neighborhoods, and Dune Park station of the Northern Indiana Commuter Transit District.

On October 6, 2008, Valparaiso inaugurated an express bus service to and from Chicago, Illinois called ChicaGo DASH. Buses depart Valparaiso on weekday mornings and return from Chicago in the evenings.

Valparaiso is served by four highways. U.S. Route 30 is the major east–west artery on the southern side of the city. Indiana State Road 49, the major north–south artery, connects with Chesterton, Indiana and the Indiana Toll Road. Indiana Route 130 runs northwest to Hobart, Indiana. Indiana State Road 2, which connects South Bend and Lowell, passes through the southeast corner of the city.

Three railroads pass through the city. The Norfolk Southern Railway operates on the tracks that were previously the Nickel Plate Road, the Canadian National is the former Grand Trunk Western Railroad and the Chicago, Fort Wayne and Eastern Railroad operates on the tracks that were previously used by the Pennsylvania Railroad.

<text>New Harmony is a historic town on the Wabash River in Harmony Township, Posey County, Indiana. It lies north of Mount Vernon, the county seat, and is part of the Evansville metropolitan area. The town&#x27;s population was 690 at the 2020 census.

Established by the Harmony Society in 1814 under the leadership of George Rapp, the town was originally known as Harmony (also called Harmonie, or New Harmony). In its early years the settlement was the home of Lutherans who had separated from the official church in the Duchy of Württemberg and immigrated to the United States. The Harmonists built a new town in the wilderness, but in 1824 they decided to sell their property and return to Pennsylvania. Robert Owen, a Welsh industrialist and social reformer, purchased the town in 1825 with the intention of creating a new utopian community and renamed it New Harmony. The Owenite social experiment failed two years after it began.

New Harmony changed American education and scientific research. Town residents established the first public library, a civic drama club, and a public school system open to men and women. Its prominent citizens included Owen&#x27;s sons: Robert Dale Owen, an Indiana congressman and social reformer who sponsored legislation to create the Smithsonian Institution; David Dale Owen, a noted state and federal geologist; William Owen, a New Harmony businessman; and Richard Owen, Indiana state geologist, Indiana University professor, and first president of Purdue University. The town also served as the second headquarters of the U.S. Geological Survey. Numerous scientists and educators contributed to New Harmony&#x27;s intellectual community, including William Maclure, Marie Louise Duclos Fretageot, Thomas Say, Charles-Alexandre Lesueur, Joseph Neef, Frances Wright, and others.

Many of the town&#x27;s old Harmonist buildings have been restored. These structures, along with others related to the Owenite community, are included in the New Harmony Historic District. Contemporary additions to the town include the Roofless Church and Atheneum. The New Harmony State Memorial is located south of town on State Road 69 in Harmonie State Park.

==History==

===Harmonist settlement (1814–1824)===

The town of Harmony was founded by Harmony Burton in 1814 under the leadership of German immigrant George Rapp (born Johann Georg Rapp). It was the second of three towns built by the pietist, communal religious group, known as Harmonists, Harmonites, or Rappites. The Harmonists settled in the Indiana Territory after leaving Harmony, Pennsylvania, where westward expansion, the area&#x27;s rising population, jealous neighbors, and the increasing cost of land threatened the Society&#x27;s desire for isolation.

In April 1814 Anna Mayrisch, John L. Baker, and Ludwick Shirver (Ludwig Schreiber) traveled west in search of a new location for their congregation, one that would have fertile soil and access to a navigable waterway. By May 10 the men had found suitable land along the Wabash River in the Indiana Territory and made an initial purchase of approximately . Rapp wrote on May10, &quot;The place is 25 miles from the Ohio mouth of the Wabash, and 12 miles from where the Ohio makes its curve first before the mouth. The town will be located about 1/4 mile from the river above on the channel on a plane as level as the floor of a room, perhaps a good quarter mile from the hill which lies suitable for a vineyard.&quot; Although Rapp expressed concern that the town&#x27;s location lacked a waterworks, the area provided an opportunity for expansion and access to markets through the nearby rivers, causing him to remark, &quot;In short, the place has all the advantages which one could wish, if a steam engine meanwhile supplies what is lacking.&quot;

The first Harmonists left Pennsylvania in June 1814 and traveled by flatboat to their new land in the Indiana Territory. In May 1815 the last of the Harmonists who had remained behind until the sale of their town in Pennsylvania was completed departed for their new town along the Wabash River. Frederick Reichert Rapp, George Rapp&#x27;s adopted son, drew up the town plan for their new village at Harmony, Indiana, which surveyors laid out on August8, 1814. By 1816, the same year that Indiana became a state, the Harmonists had acquired of land, built 160 homes and other buildings, and cleared for their new town. The settlement also began to attract new arrivals, including emigrants from Germany such as members of Rapp&#x27;s congregation from Württemberg, many of whom expected the Harmonists to pay for their passage to America. However, the new arrivals &quot;were more of a liability than an asset&quot;. On March 20, 1819, Rapp commented, &quot;It is astonishing how much trouble the people who have arrived here have made, for they have no morals and do not know what it means to live a moral and well-mannered life, not to speak of true Christianity, of denying the world or yourself.&quot;

Visitors to Harmony commented on the commercial and industrial work being done in this religious settlement along the Wabash River. &quot;It seemed as though I found myself in the midst of Germany,&quot; noted one visitor. In 1819 the town had a steam-operated wool carding and spinning factory, a horse-drawn and human-powered threshing machine, a brewery, distillery, vineyards, and a winery. The property included an orderly town, &quot;laid out in a square&quot;, with a church, school, store, dwellings for residents, and streets to create &quot;the most beautiful city of western America, because everything is built in the most perfect symmetry&quot;. Other visitors were not as impressed: &quot;hard labor &amp; coarse fare appears to be the lot of all except the family of Rapp, he lives in a large &amp; handsome brick house while the rest inhabit small log cabins. How so numerous a population are kept quietly &amp; tamely in absolute servitude it is hard to conceive—the women I believe do more labor in the field than the men, as large numbers of the latter are engaged in different branches of manufactures.&quot; Although they were not paid for their work, the 1820 manufacturer&#x27;s census reported that 75 men, 12 women, and 30 children were employed, in the Society&#x27;s tanneries, saw and grain mills, and woolen and cotton mills. Manufactured goods included cotton, flannel, and wool cloth, yarn, knit goods, tin ware, rope, beer, peach brandy, whiskey, wine, wagons, carts, plows, flour, beef, pork, butter, leather, and leather goods.

The Harmonist community continued to thrive during the 1820s, but correspondence from March 6, 1824, between Rapp and his adopted son, Frederick, indicates that the Harmonists planned to sell their Indiana property and were already looking for a new location. In May, a decade after their arrival in Indiana, the Harmonists purchased land along the Ohio River eighteen miles from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and were making arrangements to advertise the sale of their property in Indiana. The move, although it was made primarily for religious reasons, would provide the Harmonists with easier access to eastern markets and a place where they could live more peacefully with others who shared their German language and culture. On May 24, 1824, a group of Harmonists boarded a steamboat and departed Indiana, bound for Pennsylvania, where they founded the community of Economy, the present-day town of Ambridge. In May 1825 the last Harmonists left Indiana after the sale of their of property, which included the land and buildings, to Robert Owen for $150,000. Owen hoped to establish a new community on the Indiana frontier, one that would serve as a model community for communal living and social reform.
===Owen community (1825–1827)===
Robert Owen was a social reformer and wealthy industrialist who made his fortune from textile mills in New Lanark, Scotland. Owen, his twenty-two-year-old son, William, and his Scottish friend Donald McDonald sailed to the United States in 1824 to purchase a site to implement Owen&#x27;s vision for &quot;a New Moral World&quot; of happiness, enlightenment, and prosperity through education, science, technology, and communal living. Owen believed his utopian community would create a &quot;superior social, intellectual and physical environment&quot; based on his ideals of social reform. Owen was motivated to buy the town in order to prove his theories were viable and to correct the troubles that were affecting his mill-town community New Lanark. The ready-built town of Harmony, Indiana, fitted Owen&#x27;s needs. In January 1825 he signed the agreement to purchase the town, renamed it New Harmony, and invited &quot;any and all&quot; to join him there. While many of the town&#x27;s new arrivals had a sincere interest in making it a success, the experiment also attracted &quot;crackpots, free-loaders, and adventurers whose presence in the town made success unlikely.&quot; William Owen, who remained in New Harmony while his father returned east to recruit new residents, also expressed concern in his diary entry, dated March24, 1825: &quot;I doubt whether those who have been comfortable and content in their old mode of life, will find an increase of enjoyment when they come here. How long it will require to accustom themselves to their new mode of living, I am unable to determine.&quot;

When Robert Owen returned to New Harmony in April 1825 he found seven to eight hundred residents and a &quot;chaotic&quot; situation, much in need of leadership. By May 1825 the community had adopted the &quot;Constitution of the Preliminary Society,&quot; which loosely outlined its expectations and government. Under the preliminary constitution, members would provide their own household goods and invest their capital at interest in an enterprise that would promote independence and social equality. Members would render services to the community in exchange for credit at the town&#x27;s store, but those who did not want to work could purchase credit at the store with cash payments made in advance. In addition, the town would be governed by a committee of four members chosen by Owen and the community would elect three additional members. In June, Robert Owen left William in New Harmony while he traveled east to continue promoting his model community and returned to Scotland, where he sold his interests in the New Lanark textile mills and arranged financial support for his wife and two daughters, who chose to remain in Scotland. Owen&#x27;s four sons, Robert Dale, William, David Dale, and Richard, and a daughter, Jane Dale, later settled in New Harmony.

While Owen was away recruiting new residents for New Harmony, a number of factors that led to an early breakup of the socialist community had already begun. Members grumbled about inequity in credits between workers and non-workers. In addition, the town soon became overcrowded, lacked sufficient housing, and was unable to produce enough to become self-sufficient, although they still had &quot;high hopes for the future.&quot; Owen spent only a few months at New Harmony, where a shortage of skilled craftsmen and laborers along with inadequate and inexperienced supervision and management contributed to its eventual failure.

Despite the community&#x27;s shortcomings, Owen was a passionate promoter of his vision for New Harmony. While visiting Philadelphia, Owen met Marie Louise Duclos Fretageot, a Pestalozzian educator, and persuaded her to join him in Indiana. Fretageot encouraged William Maclure, a scientist and fellow educator, to become a part of the venture. (Maclure became Owen&#x27;s financial partner.) On January 26, 1826, Fretegeot, Maclure, and a number of their colleagues, including Thomas Say, Josef Neef, Charles-Alexandre Lesueur, and others aboard the keelboat &quot;Philanthropist&quot; (also called the &quot;Boatload of Knowledge&quot;), arrived in New Harmony to help Owen establish his new experiment in socialism.

On February 5, 1826, the town adopted a new constitution, &quot;The New Harmony Community of Equality&quot;, whose objective was to achieve happiness based on principles of equal rights and equality of duties. Cooperation, common property, economic benefit, freedom of speech and action, kindness and courtesy, order, preservation of health, acquisition of knowledge, and obedience to the country&#x27;s laws were included as part of the constitution. The constitution laid out the life of a citizen in New Harmony based on age. Children from the age of one to five were to be cared for and encouraged to exercise; children aged six to nine were to be lightly employed and given education via observation directed by skilled teachers. Youth from the ages of ten to twelve were to help in the houses and with the gardening. Teenagers from the age of twelve to fifteen were to receive technical training, and from fifteen to twenty their education was to be continued. Young adults from the ages of twenty to thirty were to act as a superintendent in the production and education departments. Adults from the ages of thirty to forty were to govern the homes, and residents aged forty to sixty were to be encouraged to assist with the community&#x27;s external relations or to travel abroad if they so desired.

Although the constitution contained worthy ideals, it did not clearly address how the community would function and was never fully established. Individualist anarchist Josiah Warren, who was one of the original participants in the New Harmony Society, asserted that the community was doomed to failure due to a lack of individual sovereignty and private property. He commented: &quot;It seemed that the difference of opinion, tastes and purposes increased just in proportion to the demand for conformity. Two years were worn out in this way; at the end of which, I believe that not more than three persons had the least hope of success. Most of the experimenters left in despair of all reforms, and conservatism felt itself confirmed. We had tried every conceivable form of organization and government. We had a world in miniature. --we had enacted the French revolution over again with despairing hearts instead of corpses as a result. ...It appeared that it was nature&#x27;s own inherent law of diversity that had conquered us ...our &#x27;united interests&#x27; were directly at war with the individualities of persons and circumstances and the instinct of self-preservation... and it was evident that just in proportion to the contact of persons or interests, so are concessions and compromises indispensable.&quot; (&quot;Periodical Letter II&quot; 1856).

Part of New Harmony&#x27;s failings stemmed from three activities that Owen brought from Scotland to America. First, Owen actively attacked established religion, despite United States&#x27; constitutional guarantees of religious freedom and the separations of church and state. Second, Owen remained stubbornly attached to the principles of the rationalist Age of Enlightenment, which drove away many of the Jeffersonian farmers Owen tried to attract. Thirdly, Owen consistently appealed to the upper class for donations, but found that the strategy was not as effective as it had been in Europe.

Robert Dale Owen wrote that the members of the failed socialist experiment at New Harmony were &quot;a heterogeneous collection of radicals, enthusiastic devotees to principle, honest latitudinarians, and lazy theorists, with a sprinkling of unprincipled sharpers thrown in,&quot; and that &quot;a plan which remunerates all alike, will, in the present condition of society, ultimately eliminate from a co-operative association the skilled, efficient and industrious members, leaving an ineffective and sluggish residue, in whose hands the experiment will fail, both socially and pecuniarily.&quot; However, he still thought that &quot;co-operation &quot;is&quot; a chief agency destined to quiet the clamorous conflicts between capital and labour; but then it must be co-operation gradually introduced, prudently managed, as now in England.&quot; In 1826 splinter groups dissatisfied with the efforts of the larger community broke away from the main group and prompted a reorganization.

In New Harmony work was divided into six departments, each with its own superintendent. These departments included agriculture, manufacturing, domestic economy, general economy, commerce, and literature, science and education. A governing council included the six superintendents and an elected secretary. Despite the new organization and constitution, members continued to leave town. By March 1827, after several other attempts to reorganize, the utopian experiment had failed.

The larger community, which lasted until 1827, was divided into smaller communities that led further disputes. Individualism replaced socialism in 1828 and New Harmony was dissolved in 1829 due to constant quarrels. The town&#x27;s parcels of land and property were returned to private use. Owen spent $200,000 of his own funds to purchase New Harmony property and pay off the community&#x27;s debts. His sons, Robert Dale and William, gave up their shares of the New Lanark mills in exchange for shares in New Harmony. Later, Owen &quot;conveyed the entire New Harmony property to his sons in return for an annuity of $1,500 for the remainder of his life.&quot; Owen left New Harmony in June 1827 and focused his interests in the United Kingdom. He died in 1858.

=== Accomplishments ===
==== Science ====
Although Robert Owen&#x27;s vision of New Harmony as an advance in social reform was not realized, the town became a scientific center of national significance, especially in the natural sciences, most notably geology.

William Maclure (1763–1840), president of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia from 1817 to 1840, came to New Harmony during the winter of 1825–1826. Maclure brought a group of noted artists, educators, and fellow scientists, including naturalists Thomas Say and Charles-Alexandre Lesueur, to New Harmony from Philadelphia aboard the keelboat &quot;Philanthropist&quot; (also known as the &quot;Boatload of Knowledge&quot;).

Thomas Say (1787–1834), a friend of Maclure, was an entomologist and conchologist. His definitive studies of shells and insects, numerous contributions to scientific journals, and scientific expeditions to Florida, Georgia, the Rocky Mountains, Mexico, and elsewhere made him an internationally known naturalist. Say has been called the father of American descriptive entomology and American conchology. Prior to his arrival at New Harmony, he served as librarian for the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, curator at the American Philosophical Society, and professor of natural history at the University of Pennsylvania. Say died in New Harmony in 1834.

Charles-Alexandre Lesueur (1778–1846), a naturalist and artist, came to New Harmony aboard the &quot;Philanthropist&quot;. His sketches of New Harmony provide a visual record of the town during the Owenite period. As a naturalist, Lesueur is known for his classification of Great Lakes fishes. He returned to his native France in 1837. Many species were first described by both Say and Lesueur, and many have been named in their honor.

David Dale Owen (1807–1860), third son of Robert Owen, finished his formal education as a medical doctor in 1837. However, after returning to New Harmony, David Dale Owen was influenced by the work of Maclure and Gerard Troost, a Dutch geologist, mineralogist, zoologist, and chemist who arrived in New Harmony in 1825 and later became the state geologist of Tennessee from 1831 to 1850. Owen went on to become a noted geologist. Headquartered at New Harmony, Owen conducted the first official geological survey of Indiana (1837–39). After his appointment as U.S. Geologist in 1839, Owen led federal surveys from 1839 to 1840 and from 1847 to 1851 of the Midwestern United States, which included Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and part of northern Illinois. In 1846 Owen sampled a number of possible building stones for the Smithsonian Institution Building (the Smithsonian &quot;Castle&quot;) and recommended the distinctive Seneca Creek sandstone of which that building is constructed. The following year, Owen identified a quarry at Bull Run, twenty-three miles from nation&#x27;s capital, that provided the stone for the massive building. Owen became the first state geologist of three states: Kentucky (1854–1857), Arkansas (1857–1859), and Indiana (1837–1839 and 1859–1860). Owen&#x27;s museum and laboratory in New Harmony was known as the largest west of the Allegheny Mountains. At the time of Owen&#x27;s death in 1860, his museum included some 85,000 items. Among Owen&#x27;s most significant publications is his &quot;Report of a Geological Survey of Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota and Incidentally of a Portion of Nebraska Territory&quot; (Philadelphia, 1852).

Several men trained Owen&#x27;s leadership and influence: Benjamin Franklin Shumard, for whom the Shumard oak is named, was appointed state geologist of Texas by Governor Hardin R. Runnels; Amos Henry Worthen was the second state geologist of Illinois and the first curator of the Illinois State Museum; and Fielding Bradford Meek became the first full-time paleontologist in lieu of salary at the Smithsonian Institution. Joseph Granville Norwood, one of David Dale Owen&#x27;s colleagues and coauthors, also a medical doctor, became the first state geologist of Illinois (1851–1858). From 1851 to 1854, the Illinois State Geological Survey was headquartered in New Harmony.

Richard Owen (1810–1890), Robert Owen&#x27;s youngest son, came to New Harmony in 1828 and initially taught school there. He assisted his brother, David Dale Owen, with geological survey and became Indiana&#x27;s second state geologist. During the American Civil War, Colonel Richard Owen was commandant in charge of Confederate prisoners at Camp Morton in Indianapolis. Following his retirement from the U.S. Army in 1864, Owen became a professor of natural sciences at Indiana University in Bloomington, where an academic building is named in his honor. In 1872 Owen became the first president of Purdue University, but resigned from this position in 1874. He continued teaching at IU until his retirement in 1879.

==== Public service and social reform ====
Robert Dale Owen, eldest son of Robert Owen, was a social reformer and intellectual of national importance. At New Harmony, he taught school and co-edited and published the &quot;New Harmony Gazette&quot; with Frances Wright. Owen later moved to New York. In 1830 he published &quot;Moral Philosophy,&quot; the first treatise in the United States to support birth control, and returned to New Harmony in 1834. From 1836 to 1838, and in 1851, Owen served in the Indiana legislature and was also a delegate to the state&#x27;s constitutional convention of 1850. Owen was an advocate for women&#x27;s rights, free public education, and opposed slavery. As a member of the U. S. House of Representatives from 1843 to 1847, Owen introduced a bill in 1846 that established the Smithsonian Institution. He also served as chairman of the Smithsonian Building Committee. He arranged for his brother, David Dale Owen, to sample a large number of possible building stones for the Smithsonian Castle. From 1852 to 1858 Owen held the diplomatic position of charge d&#x27;affairs (1853–1858) in Naples, where he began studying spiritualism. Owen&#x27;s book, &quot;Footfalls on the Boundary of Another World&quot; (1860), aroused something of a literary sensation. Among his critics in the &quot;Boston Investigator&quot; and at home in the &quot;New Harmony Advertiser&quot; were John and Margaret Chappellsmith, he formerly an artist for David Dale Owen&#x27;s geological publications, and she a former Owenite lecturer. Robert Dales Owen died at Lake George, New York, in 1877.

Frances Wright (1795–1852) came to New Harmony in 1824, where she co-edited and wrote for the &quot;New Harmony Gazette&quot; with Robert Dale Owen. In 1825 she established an experimental settlement at Nashoba, Tennessee, that allowed African American slaves to work to gain their freedom, but the community failed. A liberal leader in the &quot;free-thought movement,&quot; Wright opposed slavery, advocated woman&#x27;s suffrage, birth control, and free public education. Wright and Robert Dale Owen moved their newspaper to New York City in 1829 and published it as the &quot;Free Enquirer&quot;. Wright married William Philquepal d&#x27;Arusmont, a Pestalozzian educator she met at New Harmony. The couple also lived in Paris, France, and in Cincinnati, Ohio, where they divorced in 1850. Wright died in Cincinnati in 1852.

==== History of education ====
The history of education at New Harmony involves several teachers who were already well-established in their fields before they moved to New Harmony, largely through the efforts of William Maclure. These Pestalozzian educators included Marie Duclos Fretageot and Joseph Neef. By the time Maclure arrived in New Harmony he had already established the first Pestalozzian school in America. Fretageot and Neef had been Pestalozzian educators and school administrators at Maclure&#x27;s schools in Pennsylvania.

Under Maclure&#x27;s direction and using his philosophy of education, New Harmony schools became the first public schools in the United States open to boys and girls. Maclure also established at New Harmony one of the country&#x27;s first industrial or trade schools. He also had his extensive library and geological collection shipped to New Harmony from Philadelphia. In 1838 Maclure established The Working Men&#x27;s Institute, a society for &quot;mutual instruction&quot;. It includes the oldest continuously operating library in Indiana, as well as a small museum. The vault in the library contains many historic manuscripts, letters, and documents pertaining to the history of New Harmony. Under the terms of his will, Maclure also offered $500 to any club or society of laborers in the United States who established a reading and lecture room with a library of at least 100 books. About 160 libraries in Indiana and Illinois took advantage of his bequest.

Marie Duclos Fretageot managed Pestalozzian schools that Maclure organized in France and Philadelphia before coming to New Harmony aboard the &quot;Philanthropist&quot;. In New Harmony she was responsible for the infant&#x27;s school (for children under age five), supervised several young women she had brought with her from Philadelphia, ran a store, and was Maclure&#x27;s administrator during his residence in Mexico. Fretageot remained in New Harmony until 1831, returned to France, and later joined Maclure in Mexico, where she died in 1833. Correspondence of Maclure and Fretageot from 1820 to 1833 was extensive and is documented in &quot;Partnership for Posterity.&quot;

Joseph Neef ( 1770–1854) published in 1808 the first work on educational method to be written in English in the United States, &quot;Sketch of A Plan and Method of Education.&quot; Maclure brought Neef, a Pestalozzian educator from Switzerland, to Philadelphia, and placed him in charge of his school for boys. It was the first school in the United States to be based on Pestalozzian methods. In 1826 Neef, his wife, and children came to New Harmony to run the schools under Maclure&#x27;s direction. Neef, following Maclure&#x27;s curriculum, became superintendent of the schools in New Harmony, where as many as 200 students, ranging in age from five to twelve, were enrolled.

Jane Dale Owen Fauntleroy (1806–1861), daughter of Robert Owen, arrived in New Harmony in 1833. She married civil engineer Robert Henry Fauntleroy in 1835. He became a business partner of David Dale and Robert Dale Owen. Jane Owen Fauntleroy established a seminary for young women in her family&#x27;s New Harmony home, where her brother, David Dale Owen, taught science.

Students in New Harmony now attend North Posey High School after New Harmony High School closed in 2012.

==== Publishing ====
Cornelius Tiebout (c. 1773–1832) was an artist, printer, and engraver of considerable fame when he joined the New Harmony community in September 1826. Tiebout taught printing and published a bimonthly newspaper, &quot;Disseminator of Useful Knowledge&quot;, and books using the town&#x27;s printing press. He died in New Harmony in 1832.

Publications from New Harmony&#x27;s press include William Maclure&#x27;s &quot;Essay on the Formation of Rocks, or an Inquiry into the Probably Origin of their Present Form&quot; (1832); and Maclure&#x27;s &quot;Structure&quot; and &quot;Observations on the Geology of the West India Islands; from Barbadoes to Santa Cruz, Inclusive&quot; (1832); Thomas Say&#x27;s &quot;Description of New Species of North American Insects; Observations on Some of the Species Already Described&quot;; &quot;Descriptions of Some New Terrestrial and Fluviatile Shells of North America&quot;; and several of the early volumes of Say&#x27;s &quot;American Conchology, or Descriptions of the Shells of North America&quot;. (The seventh volume of &quot;American Conchology&quot; was published in Philadelphia.)

Lucy Sistare Say was an apprentice at Fretageot&#x27;s Pestalozzian school and a former student of Lesueur in Philadelphia before coming to New Harmony aboard the &quot;Philanthropist&quot; to teach needlework and drawing. En route to Indiana, Sistare met Thomas Say and the two were married on January 4, 1827, prior to their arrival at New Harmony. An accomplished artist, Say illustrated and hand-colored 66 of the 68 illustrations in &quot;American Conchology,&quot; her husband&#x27;s multi-volume work on mollusks. Following Thomas Say&#x27;s death in 1834, she moved to New York, trained to become an engraver, and worked to complete and publish the final volume of &quot;American Conchology&quot;. Lucy Say remained interested in the natural sciences after returning to the East. In 1841 she became the first female member of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.

German-American folk artist Jacob Maentel (c. 1763–1863) lived in New Harmony from 1836 until his death. During this time he prolifically painted portraiture in the &quot;fraktur&quot; style and portrayed the dress and décor of local Owenites. Examples of his work are displayed in the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the American Folk Art Museum, and the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Museum.

Publications on the history of New Harmony include the work of the New Harmony historian and resident, Josephine Mirabella Elliott.

==== Theater ====
William Owen (1802–1842), Robert Owen&#x27;s second oldest son, was involved in New Harmony&#x27;s business and community affairs. He was among the leaders who founded New Harmony&#x27;s Thespian Society and acted in some of the group&#x27;s performances. Owen also helped establish the Posey County Agricultural Society and, in 1834, became director of the State Bank of Indiana, Evansville Branch. He died in New Harmony in 1842.

=== Historic structures ===
More than 30 structures from the Harmonist and Owenite utopian communities remain as part of the New Harmony Historic District, which is a National Historic Landmark. In addition, architect Richard Meier designed New Harmony&#x27;s Atheneum, which serves as the Visitors Center for Historic New Harmony, and depicts the history of the community. Also listed on the National Register of Historic Places
are the George Bentel House, Ludwig Epple House, Harmony Way Bridge, Mattias Scholle House, and Amon Clarence Thomas House.

<text>Poseyville is a town in Robb Township, Posey County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 1,045 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The town of Poseyville was originally called Palestine when the town was first surveyed and laid out by James Smith on February 28, 1840. The town was set up along the New Harmony-Princeton coach line. The new town was recorded at the Posey County Recorder&#x27;s Office on November 20, 1840.

Palestine was renamed Poseyville when the town got its first post office on February 10, 1843, due to another town named Palestine, Indiana, which already had a post office. The name was officially approved and changed by the Indiana State Legislature on December 26, 1844, but did not get recorded locally. The history books of Posey County state the town name was changed in 1852. This was the year that the town was first referred to as Poseyville in the county records. This was due to the addition of two new plats: Cale&#x27;s Enlargement and Fletchall&#x27;s Enlargement. This tripled the size of the town.

The Bozeman-Waters National Bank was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.

<text>Medaryville is a town in White Post Township, Pulaski County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 614 at the 2010 census.

==History==

Medaryville was laid out in 1852, just ahead of the construction of the New Albany and Salem Railroad, later called the Monon Railroad. The town was sited at the intersection of the railroad and the old Rensselaer to Winamac Road, used by settlers to travel to the Land Office in Winamac to record their claims. Medaryville was one of the few towns along the new railroad that was not laid out by James Brooks, president of the line.

The railroad today comes into Medaryville from the south, but the tracks end just north of Pearl Street. The town has always been a commercial rail shipping center for agricultural products, and a large grain storage and shipping complex remains today.

Medaryville sits at the irregular intersection of two major landforms. The northern edge of what was called the Grand Prairie lies just south of the town, and the huge swampy outwash plains of the Greater Kankakee River basin are to the north and west. Just west of town once existed a vast &quot;Impassable Swamp&quot; which was known to the earliest European explorers of the continent.

It was drained as part of projects of the Swamp Land Act of 1850, which resulted in the disappearance of virtually all of the once-imposing swamps. Most of that land resides in adjacent Jasper county, where a Swamplands scandal in the early 1860s resulted in a county official, who was accused of embezzlement, burning down the local courthouse to cover his tracks before skipping town.

Before the areas were drained, the temperate swamps supported a nearly unimaginable variety of flora and fauna. Pioneer accounts relate an abundance of game of every type, and many local residents made their living by hunting and trapping in the early settlement days.

The &quot;proprietors&quot; of the new town were Josiah Walden and William Clark, who owned the land on the east and west sides of the railroad, respectively. They were assisted by Carter Hathaway, who was a surveyor, lawyer, politician, and entrepreneur. Hathaway&#x27;s ornate map of the little town &quot;Medary Ville&quot; was recorded in March 1852, at the Pulaski County courthouse in Winamac, the county seat. The town was laid out using old English units of measure: all the lots were four rods by eight rods, with the streets three rods wide and the alleys one. There is an exception for the lots that abut the railroad, because the right-of-way was 100 feet, which isn&#x27;t an even multiple of a rod.

Neither Walden nor Clark stayed in Medaryville. Reprising the migrations that brought them to the area, each moved west again. In 1857 Clark went to Iowa, selling what was left of his holdings to William Tolbert Elston, the town&#x27;s first doctor. Walden left for Kansas in 1864, selling his interest in the town to James C. Faris, a lawyer. Faris&#x27;s son George Washington Faris served several terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, representing an area surrounding his home in Terre Haute.

The town was most likely named after Samuel Medary, an Ohio newspaper editor and politician who moved west with the settlers and was the last governor of the Minnesota Territory before it gained statehood. He was later the governor of the Kansas Territory. Other towns named after him are Medary, Wisconsin, near the Minnesota border, and Medary, South Dakota, which was the first town platted in the Dakota Territory.

Medary was also a common given name in Carter Hathaway&#x27;s family. He named his son Richard Medary, and his brother Richard named his son Medary Montez. In 1850 Carter Hathaway platted Knox, the county seat of adjoining Starke county. He was a judge and county official in Pulaski county in the 1850s. Just after the Civil War he and his son Richard were in Rochester, Indiana, where they were involved in editing and publishing The Standard, which later became the Rochester Sentinel.

Medaryville is shown as &quot;Madeiraville&quot; on Mitchell&#x27;s New Universal Atlas, 1857. The town was once also commonly known Medarysville; one history incorrectly asserts that such was the original name.

 had an oil rush at the turn of the 20th century. Many wells were put in just west of town, and a refinery was built at the little town of Asphaltum. The oil pockets were of limited production, however, and the oil of poor quality. The enterprise was quickly abandoned. Attempts to rekindle the boom occurred in the 1950s and again in the 1980s, without gaining traction.

Also at the turn of the century B. J. Gifford&#x27;s ambitious agricultural enterprise, known locally as the Gifford Marsh, and his railroad, The Chicago and Wabash Valley, lay west of town. From the 1930s to about 1980 William Gehring grew vegetables on much of the old Gifford land. The proximity of the potato fields led to Medaryville&#x27;s longstanding nickname &quot;Tatertown.&quot; In the past, town held a festival known as the Potato Fest, in honor of this facet of its history.

== Geography ==
The Jasper-Pulaski Fish and Wildlife Area is northwest of town. This nature preserve is a stopover point for migrating Sandhill cranes, and attracts many visitors each fall. Each October the Medaryville/White Post Twp Fire Department sponsors a bike ride, known as the Crane Cruise, that runs through the heart of the migration territory.

According to the 2010 census, Medaryville has a total area of , all land.

<text>Winamac is a town in Monroe Township, Pulaski County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 2,490 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Pulaski County.

==History==
The town&#x27;s name came from the Potawatomi word for &quot;catfish.&quot; It was selected as the county seat in 1839. Winamac was incorporated as a town in 1868.

The Winamac post office has been in operation since 1839.

Pulaski County Courthouse, Dr. George W. Thompson House, and Vurpillat&#x27;s Opera House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Notable Landmarks ==
Winamac has several local landmarks scattered throughout the town.

=== The Artesian Well ===
In June 1877, the Winamac Gas and Oil company began drilling near th Tippecanoe River. Instead of oil, they discovered a water vein at 264 feet below the ground. In the following years, demand for the well&#x27;s water created a small industry within the community, and local boys ventured to earn money by delivering this water to homes. During this time, the water was marketed as containing healing properties. Interest in the well had died down by the end of the 19th century. By 1920, the well had fallen victim to vandalism and decay, and was subsequently repaired. Unfortunately, the well&#x27;s water pressure was later compromised by other local projects, causing it to dry up. It was capped, and an informational plaque was dedicated to the well on the 100th anniversary of its drilling. Today, it stands as a reminder of local history on the west side of the town park.

=== The Memorial Swinging Bridge ===
The Winamac Town Park is home to a large suspension bridge over the Tippecanoe River. This bridge was dedicated on July 4, 1923, in honor of soldiers and sailors from the Civil War onward. It has since been a popular local attraction, serving as the subject of many greeting cards and photoshoots since its dedication.

In 2020, the &quot;Light Up Our Legacy Project&quot; began, hoping to raise money to install LED lights on the bridge. The goal was reached, and the bridge underwent renovations through early spring of 2023, with the goal of unveiling the lights on July 4, 2023.

The popularity of the race resulted in its appearing on the television programs regionally on &quot;Across Indiana&quot; and nationally on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. In addition to being covered by &quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot; newspaper, the race was written up in &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot;. Many contestants dress their roaches by gluing paper top hats, saddles, or other apparel to their backs. At the end of racing the roaches are collected, sprayed with insecticide, and disposed of.

<text>Modoc is a town in Union Township, Randolph County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 157 at the 2020 census.

==History==
There are several legends to how the town of Modoc got its name. One of them said that a man travelling on the train threw out a cigar box containing the name Modoc, and that Henry Conley, one of the first settlers of the town, picked it up and suggested to bystanders that it would be a good name for the town. Another theory is that Modoc was named after the Modoc people who were traditionally located in northern California. They became noted for their resistance to the US Army during the Modoc War, ending in 1873.

A post office has been in operation at Modoc since 1883.

== Randolph Farms Landfill ==
Randolph Farms Landfill is a 120-acre (486,000 m2) landfill owned by the Balkema family of Kalamazoo, Michigan, located in Randolph County, Indiana. In addition to Randolph County, it serves Delaware, Madison, Jay, Wayne, and Henry Counties in Indiana, as well as Darke and Miami Counties in Ohio. Randolph Farms was built on a limestone hill, directly over sand and gravel aquifers, near the drainage basins of White River and Whitewater River.

==Education==
Modoc&#x27;s high school is Union High School. The mascot of the school is the Rocket. Their colors are royal blue and gold.

==The I. B. &amp; W. Railroad==
Modoc, like many other small towns, probably would not have been built if the I. B. &amp; W. Railroad had not made its way across southern Randolph County, in 1878. The location was poorly drained, but it had the advantage of being rather flat. It was plagued, for many years, by typhoid fever outbreaks. The railroad was built by many contractors. The railroad came through Modoc from the west, and met the contractors, who were building the next section east, in what was then a strip of timber about one-half mile east of where the depot was located.

<doc id="112577" wikidata="Q235038" url="?curid=112577" title="Technical analysis">
<text>In finance, technical analysis is an analysis methodology for analysing and forecasting the direction of prices through the study of past market data, primarily price and volume. As a type of active management, it stands in contradiction to much of modern portfolio theory. The efficacy of technical analysis is disputed by the efficient-market hypothesis, which states that stock market prices are essentially unpredictable, and research on whether technical analysis offers any benefit has produced mixed results. It is distinguished from fundamental analysis, which considers a company&#x27;s financial statements, health, and the overall state of the market and economy.

==History==
The principles of technical analysis are derived from hundreds of years of financial market data. Some aspects of technical analysis began to appear in Amsterdam-based merchant Joseph de la Vega&#x27;s accounts of the Dutch financial markets in the 17th century. In Asia, technical analysis is said to be a method developed by Homma Munehisa during the early 18th century which evolved into the use of candlestick techniques, and is today a technical analysis charting tool.

Journalist Charles Dow (1851-1902) compiled and closely analyzed American stock market data, and published some of his conclusions in editorials for The Wall Street Journal. He believed patterns and business cycles could possibly be found in this data, a concept later known as &quot;Dow theory&quot;. However, Dow himself never advocated using his ideas as a stock trading strategy.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Richard W. Schabacker published several books which continued the work of Charles Dow and William Peter Hamilton in their books &quot;Stock Market Theory and Practice&quot; and &quot;Technical Market Analysis&quot;. In 1948, Robert D. Edwards and John Magee published &quot;Technical Analysis of Stock Trends&quot; which is widely considered to be one of the seminal works of the discipline. It is exclusively concerned with trend analysis and chart patterns and remains in use to the present. Early technical analysis was almost exclusively the analysis of charts because the processing power of computers was not available for the modern degree of statistical analysis. Charles Dow reportedly originated a form of point and figure chart analysis. With the emergence of behavioral finance as a separate discipline in economics, Paul V. Azzopardi combined technical analysis with behavioral finance and coined the term &quot;Behavioral Technical Analysis&quot;.

Other pioneers of analysis techniques include Ralph Nelson Elliott, William Delbert Gann, and Richard Wyckoff who developed their respective techniques in the early 20th century.

==General description==
Fundamental analysts examine earnings, dividends, assets, quality, ratios, new products, research and the like. Technicians employ many methods, tools and techniques as well, one of which is the use of charts. Using charts, technical analysts seek to identify price patterns and market trends in financial markets and attempt to exploit those patterns.

Technicians using charts search for archetypal price chart patterns, such as the well-known head and shoulders or double top/bottom reversal patterns, study technical indicators, moving averages and look for forms such as lines of support, resistance, channels and more obscure formations such as flags, pennants, balance days and cup and handle patterns.

Technical analysts also widely use market indicators of many sorts, some of which are mathematical transformations of price, often including up and down volume, advance/decline data and other inputs. These indicators are used to help assess whether an asset is trending, and if it is, the probability of its direction and of continuation. Technicians also look for relationships between price/volume indices and market indicators. Examples include the moving average, relative strength index and MACD. Other avenues of study include correlations between changes in Options (implied volatility) and put/call ratios with price. Also important are sentiment indicators such as Put/Call ratios, bull/bear ratios, short interest, Implied Volatility, etc.

There are many techniques in technical analysis. Adherents of different techniques (for example: Candlestick analysis, the oldest form of technical analysis developed by a Japanese grain trader; Harmonics; Dow theory; and Elliott wave theory) may ignore the other approaches, yet many traders combine elements from more than one technique. Some technical analysts use subjective judgment to decide which pattern(s) a particular instrument reflects at a given time and what the interpretation of that pattern should be. Others employ a strictly mechanical or systematic approach to pattern identification and interpretation.

===Comparison with fundamental analysis===
Contrasting with technical analysis is &quot;fundamental analysis&quot;: the study of economic
and other underlying factors that influence the way investors price financial markets. This may include regular corporate metrics like a company&#x27;s recent EBITDA figures, the estimated impact of recent staffing changes to the board of directors, geopolitical considerations, and even scientific factors like the estimated future effects of global warming. Pure forms of technical analysis can hold that prices already reflect all the underlying fundamental factors. Uncovering future trends is what technical indicators are designed to do, although neither technical nor fundamental indicators are perfect. Some traders use technical or fundamental analysis exclusively, while others use both types to make trading decisions.

===Comparison with quantitative analysis ===
The contrast against quantitative analysis is less clear cut than the distinction with fundamental analysis. Some sources treat technical and quantitative analysis as more or less synonymous, while others draw a sharp distinction. For example, quantitative analysis expert Paul Wilmott suggests technical analysis is little more than &#x27;charting&#x27; (making forecasts based on extrapolating graphical representations), and that technical analysis rarely has any predictive power.

==Principles==

A core principle of technical analysis is that a market&#x27;s price reflects all relevant information impacting that market. A technical analyst therefore looks at the history of a security or commodity&#x27;s trading pattern rather than external drivers such as economic, fundamental and news events. It is believed that price action tends to repeat itself due to the collective, patterned behavior of investors. Hence technical analysis focuses on identifiable price trends and conditions.

===Market action discounts everything===
Based on the premise that all relevant information is already reflected by prices, technical analysts believe it is important to understand what investors think of that information, known and perceived.

===Prices move in trends===

Technical analysts believe that prices trend directionally, i.e., up, down, or sideways (flat) or some combination. The basic definition of a price trend was originally put forward by Dow theory.

An example of a security that had an apparent trend is AOL from November 2001 through August 2002. A technical analyst or trend follower recognizing this trend would look for opportunities to sell this security. AOL consistently moves downward in price. Each time the stock rose, sellers would enter the market and sell the stock; hence the &quot;zig-zag&quot; movement in the price. The series of &quot;lower highs&quot; and &quot;lower lows&quot; is a tell tale sign of a stock in a down trend. In other words, each time the stock moved lower, it fell below its previous relative low price. Each time the stock moved higher, it could not reach the level of its previous relative high price.

Note that the sequence of lower lows and lower highs did not begin until August. Then AOL makes a low price that does not pierce the relative low set earlier in the month. Later in the same month, the stock makes a relative high equal to the most recent relative high. In this a technician sees strong indications that the down trend is at least pausing and possibly ending, and would likely stop actively selling the stock at that point.

Market Psychology Behind Candlestick Patterns

Candlestick patterns are widely used in technical analysis (TA) not only for identifying trends but also for interpreting market psychology. After all, these candlesticks are just a display of human emotion, and technical analysis, allows you to make decisions based on human interaction with the specified asset. These patterns reflect the emotions of market participants, such as fear, greed, and uncertainty, which drive price movements. The study of candlestick formations helps traders anticipate market sentiment, making them a crucial component in making decisions.

Sentiment Representation in Candlesticks

Each candlestick visually represents a battle between buyers and sellers. Long-bodied bullish candles (green) indicate strong buying pressure and optimism, whereas long-bodied bearish candles (red) signal fear and aggressive selling. Small-bodied candles or Doji formations suggest indecision, where neither buyers or sellers dominate. A simple indecision can lead to many conclusions.

It can be that:

- People think asset is not overpriced, nor underpriced.

- People awaiting major-news event to build confidence in either direction

- Low trading volume

- People have no reason to buy or sell the asset

- Liquidity concerns, where traders are hesitant due to a lack of buyers or sellers at certain price levels

This is just one candlestick pattern that forms, and many conclusions can be derived from it. There are many more candlestick formations.

Behavioral Finance

Market behavior repeats due to collective investor emotions. Human emotion can act like a trend, and it is evidence through history analyzation. Studies in behavioral finance suggest that patterns like trend continuation and reversals occur because traders react predictably to psychological triggers such as confirmation bias and herd mentality. Fear and greed dominate trading decisions, often leading to predictable price movements.

Understanding candlestick psychology provides traders with deeper insight into market sentiment, complementing other technical and fundamental analysis tools. By recognizing the interplay between human emotion and price action, traders can develop strategies that align with market sentiment, increasing the likelihood of success in their trades.

===History tends to repeat itself===
Technical analysts believe that investors collectively repeat the behavior of the investors who preceded them. To a technician, the emotions in the market may be irrational, but they exist. Because investor behavior repeats itself so often, technicians believe that recognizable (and predictable) price patterns will develop on a chart. Recognition of these patterns can allow the technician to select trades that have a higher probability of success.

Technical analysis is not limited to charting, but it always considers price trends. For example, many technicians monitor surveys of investor sentiment. These surveys gauge the attitude of market participants, specifically whether they are bearish or bullish. Technicians use these surveys to help determine whether a trend will continue or if a reversal could develop; they are most likely to anticipate a change when the surveys report extreme investor sentiment. Surveys that show overwhelming bullishness, for example, are evidence that an uptrend may reverse; the premise being that if most investors are bullish they have already bought the market (anticipating higher prices). And because most investors &quot;are&quot; bullish and invested, one assumes that few buyers remain. This leaves more potential sellers than buyers, despite the bullish sentiment. This suggests that prices will trend down, and is an example of contrarian trading.

The industry is globally represented by the International Federation of Technical Analysts (IFTA), which is a federation of regional and national organizations. In the United States, the industry is represented by both the CMT Association and the American Association of Professional Technical Analysts (AAPTA). The United States is also represented by the Technical Security Analysts Association of San Francisco (TSAASF). In the United Kingdom, the industry is represented by the Society of Technical Analysts (STA). The STA was a founding member of IFTA, has recently celebrated its 50th anniversary and certifies analysts with the Diploma in Technical Analysis. In Canada the industry is represented by the Canadian Society of Technical Analysts. In Australia, the industry is represented by the Australian Technical Analysts Association (ATAA), (which is affiliated to IFTA) and the Australian Professional Technical Analysts (APTA) Inc.

Professional technical analysis societies have worked on creating a body of knowledge that describes the field of Technical Analysis. A body of knowledge is central to the field as a way of defining how and why technical analysis may work. It can then be used by academia, as well as regulatory bodies, in developing proper research and standards for the field. The CMT Association has published a body of knowledge, which is the structure for the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) exam.

===Software===
Technical analysis software automates the charting, analysis and reporting functions that support technical analysts in their review and prediction of financial markets (e.g. the stock market).

In addition to installable desktop-based software packages in the traditional sense, the industry has seen an emergence of cloud-based applications and application programming interfaces (APIs) that deliver technical indicators (e.g., MACD, Bollinger Bands) via RESTful HTTP or intranet protocols.

Modern technical analysis software is often available as a web or a smartphone application, without the need to download and install a software package. Some of them even offer an integrated programming language and automatic backtesting tools.

==Systematic trading==
===Neural networks===
Since the early 1990s when the first practically usable types emerged, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have rapidly grown in popularity. They are artificial intelligence adaptive software systems that have been inspired by how biological neural networks work. They are used because they can learn to detect complex patterns in data. In mathematical terms, they are universal function approximators, meaning that given the right data and configured correctly, they can capture and model any input-output relationships. This not only removes the need for human interpretation of charts or the series of rules for generating entry/exit signals, but also provides a bridge to fundamental analysis, as the variables used in fundamental analysis can be used as input.

As ANNs are essentially non-linear statistical models, their accuracy and prediction capabilities can be both mathematically and empirically tested. In various studies, authors have claimed that neural networks used for generating trading signals given various technical and fundamental inputs have significantly outperformed buy-hold strategies as well as traditional linear technical analysis methods when combined with rule-based expert systems.

While the advanced mathematical nature of such adaptive systems has kept neural networks for financial analysis mostly within academic research circles, in recent years more user friendly neural network software has made the technology more accessible to traders.

===Backtesting/Hindcasting===

Systematic trading is most often employed after testing an investment strategy on historic data. This is known as backtesting (or hindcasting). Backtesting is most often performed for technical indicators combined with volatility but can be applied to most investment strategies (e.g. fundamental analysis). While traditional backtesting was done by hand, this was usually only performed on human-selected stocks, and was thus prone to prior knowledge in stock selection. With the advent of computers, backtesting can be performed on entire exchanges over decades of historic data in very short amounts of time.

The use of computers does have its drawbacks, being limited to algorithms that a computer can perform. Several trading strategies rely on human interpretation, and are unsuitable for computer processing. Only technical indicators which are entirely algorithmic can be programmed for computerized automated backtesting.

==Combination with other market forecast methods==
John Murphy states that the principal sources of information available to technicians are price, volume and open interest. Other data, such as indicators and sentiment analysis, are considered secondary.

However, many technical analysts reach outside pure technical analysis, combining other market forecast methods with their technical work. One advocate for this approach is John Bollinger, who coined the term &quot;rational analysis&quot; in the middle 1980s for the intersection of technical analysis and fundamental analysis. Another such approach, fusion analysis, overlays fundamental analysis with technical, in an attempt to improve portfolio manager performance.

Technical analysis is also often combined with quantitative analysis and economics. For example, neural networks may be used to help identify intermarket relationships.

Investor and newsletter polls, and magazine cover sentiment indicators, are also used by technical analysts.

==Empirical evidence==
Whether technical analysis actually works is a matter of controversy. Methods vary greatly, and different technical analysts can sometimes make contradictory predictions from the same data. Many investors claim that they experience positive returns, but academic appraisals often find that it has little predictive power. Of 95 modern studies, 56 concluded that technical analysis had positive results, although data-snooping bias and other problems make the analysis difficult. Nonlinear prediction using neural networks occasionally produces statistically significant prediction results. A Federal Reserve working paper regarding support and resistance levels in short-term foreign exchange rates &quot;offers strong evidence that the levels help to predict intraday trend interruptions&quot;, although the &quot;predictive power&quot; of those levels was &quot;found to vary across the exchange rates and firms examined&quot;.

Technical trading strategies were found to be effective in the Chinese marketplace by a 2007 study that states, &quot;Finally, we find significant positive returns on buy trades generated by the contrarian version of the moving-average crossover rule, the channel breakout rule, and the Bollinger band trading rule, after accounting for transaction costs of 0.50%.&quot;

An influential 1992 study by Brock et al. appeared to find support for technical trading rules. Sullivan and Timmerman tested the 1992 study for data snooping and other problems in 1999; they determined the sample covered by Brock et al. was robust to data snooping.

Subsequently, a comprehensive study of the question by Amsterdam economist Gerwin Griffioen concludes that: &quot;for the U.S., Japanese and most Western European stock market indices the recursive out-of-sample forecasting procedure does not show to be profitable, after implementing little transaction costs. Moreover, for sufficiently high transaction costs it is found, by estimating CAPMs, that technical trading shows no statistically significant risk-corrected out-of-sample forecasting power for almost all of the stock market indices.&quot; Transaction costs are particularly applicable to &quot;momentum strategies&quot;; a comprehensive 1996 review of the data and studies concluded that even small transaction costs would lead to an inability to capture any excess from such strategies.

In a 2000 paper published in the &quot;Journal of Finance&quot;, professor Andrew W. Lo of MIT, working with Harry Mamaysky and Jiang Wang found that:

In that same paper Lo wrote that &quot;several academic studies suggest that ... technical analysis may well be an effective means for extracting useful information from market prices.&quot; Some techniques such as Drummond Geometry attempt to overcome the past data bias by projecting support and resistance levels from differing time frames into the near-term future and combining that with reversion to the mean techniques.

===Efficient-market hypothesis===
The efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) contradicts the basic tenets of technical analysis by stating that past prices cannot be used to profitably predict future prices. Thus it holds that technical analysis cannot be effective. Economist Eugene Fama published the seminal paper on the EMH in the &quot;Journal of Finance&quot; in 1970, and said &quot;In short, the evidence in support of the efficient markets model is extensive, and (somewhat uniquely in economics) contradictory evidence is sparse.&quot;

However, because future stock prices can be strongly influenced by investor expectations, technicians claim it only follows that past prices influence future prices. They also point to research in the field of behavioral finance, specifically that people are not the rational participants EMH makes them out to be. Technicians have long said that irrational human behavior influences stock prices, and that this behavior leads to predictable outcomes. Author David Aronson says that the theory of behavioral finance blends with the practice of technical analysis:

By considering the impact of emotions, cognitive errors, irrational preferences, and the dynamics of group behavior, behavioral finance offers succinct explanations of excess market volatility as well as the excess returns earned by stale information strategies... cognitive errors may also explain the existence of market inefficiencies that spawn the systematic price movements that allow objective TA [technical analysis] methods to work.

EMH advocates reply that while individual market participants do not always act rationally (or have complete information), their aggregate decisions balance each other, resulting in a rational outcome (optimists who buy stock and bid the price higher are countered by pessimists who sell their stock, which keeps the price in equilibrium). Likewise, complete information is reflected in the price because all market participants bring their own individual, but incomplete, knowledge together in the market.

====Random walk hypothesis====
The random walk hypothesis may be derived from the weak-form efficient markets hypothesis, which is based on the assumption that market participants take full account of any information contained in past price movements (but not necessarily other public information). In his book &quot;A Random Walk Down Wall Street&quot;, Princeton economist Burton Malkiel said that technical forecasting tools such as pattern analysis must ultimately be self-defeating: &quot;The problem is that once such a regularity is known to market participants, people will act in such a way that prevents it from happening in the future.&quot; Malkiel has stated that while momentum may explain some stock price movements, there is not enough momentum to make excess profits. Malkiel has compared technical analysis to &quot;astrology&quot;.

In the late 1980s, professors Andrew Lo and Craig McKinlay published a paper which cast doubt on the random walk hypothesis. In a 1999 response to Malkiel, Lo and McKinlay collected empirical papers that questioned the hypothesis&#x27; applicability that suggested a non-random and possibly predictive component to stock price movement, though they were careful to point out that rejecting random walk does not necessarily invalidate EMH, which is an entirely separate concept from RWH. In a 2000 paper, Andrew Lo back-analyzed data from the U.S. from 1962 to 1996 and found that &quot;several technical indicators do provide incremental information and may have some practical value&quot;. Burton Malkiel dismissed the irregularities mentioned by Lo and McKinlay as being too small to profit from.

Technicians argue that the EMH and random walk theories both ignore the realities of markets, in that participants are not completely rational and that current price moves are not independent of previous moves. Some signal processing researchers negate the random walk hypothesis that stock market prices resemble Wiener processes, because the statistical moments of such processes and real stock data vary significantly with respect to window size and similarity measure. They argue that feature transformations used for the description of audio and biosignals can also be used to predict stock market prices successfully which would contradict the random walk hypothesis.

The random walk index (RWI) is a technical indicator that attempts to determine if a stock&#x27;s price movement is random in nature or a result of a statistically significant trend. The random walk index attempts to determine when the market is in a strong uptrend or downtrend by measuring price ranges over N and how it differs from what would be expected by a random walk (randomly going up or down). The greater the range suggests a stronger trend.

Applying Kahneman and Tversky&#x27;s prospect theory to price movements, Paul V. Azzopardi provided a possible explanation why fear makes prices fall sharply while greed pushes up prices gradually. This commonly observed behaviour of securities prices is sharply at odds with random walk. By gauging greed and fear in the market, investors can better formulate long and short portfolio stances.

==Scientific technical analysis==

Caginalp and Balenovich in 1994 used their asset-flow differential equations model to show that the major patterns of technical analysis could be generated with some basic assumptions. Some of the patterns such as a triangle continuation or reversal pattern can be generated with the assumption of two distinct groups of investors with different assessments of valuation. The major assumptions of the models are the finiteness of assets and the use of trend as well as valuation in decision making. Many of the patterns follow as mathematically logical consequences of these assumptions.

One of the problems with conventional technical analysis has been the difficulty of specifying the patterns in a manner that permits objective testing.

Japanese candlestick patterns involve patterns of a few days that are within an uptrend or downtrend. Caginalp and Laurent were the first to perform a successful large scale test of patterns. A mathematically precise set of criteria were tested by first using a definition of a short-term trend by smoothing the data and allowing for one deviation in the smoothed trend. They then considered eight major three-day candlestick reversal patterns in a non-parametric manner and defined the patterns as a set of inequalities. The results were positive with an overwhelming statistical confidence for each of the patterns using the data set of all S&amp;P 500 stocks daily for the five-year period 1992–1996.

Among the most basic ideas of conventional technical analysis is that a trend, once established, tends to continue. However, testing for this trend has often led researchers to conclude that stocks are a random walk. One study, performed by Poterba and Summers, found a small trend effect that was too small to be of trading value. As Fisher Black
noted, &quot;noise&quot; in trading price data makes it difficult to test hypotheses.

One method for avoiding this noise was discovered in 1995 by Caginalp and Constantine who used a ratio of two essentially identical closed-end funds to eliminate any changes in valuation. A closed-end fund (unlike an open-end fund) trades independently of its net asset value and its shares cannot be redeemed, but only traded among investors as any other stock on the exchanges. In this study, the authors found that the best estimate of tomorrow&#x27;s price is not yesterday&#x27;s price (as the efficient-market hypothesis would indicate), nor is it the pure momentum price (namely, the same relative price change from yesterday to today continues from today to tomorrow). But rather it is almost exactly halfway between the two.

Starting from the characterization of the past time evolution of market prices in terms of price velocity and price acceleration, an attempt towards a general framework for technical analysis has been developed, with the goal of establishing a principled classification of the possible patterns characterizing the deviation or defects from the random walk market state and its time translational invariant properties. The classification relies on two dimensionless parameters, the Froude number characterizing the relative strength of the acceleration with respect to the velocity and the time horizon forecast dimensionalized to the training period. Trend-following and contrarian patterns are found to coexist and depend on the dimensionless time horizon. Using a renormalisation group approach, the probabilistic based scenario approach exhibits statistically significant predictive power in essentially all tested market phases.

A survey of modern studies by Park and Irwin showed that most found a positive result from technical analysis.

In 2011, Caginalp and DeSantis have used large data sets of closed-end funds, where comparison with valuation is possible, in order to determine quantitatively whether key aspects of technical analysis such as trend and resistance have scientific validity. Using data sets of over 100,000 points they demonstrate that trend has an effect that is at least half as important as valuation. The effects of volume and volatility, which are smaller, are also evident and statistically significant. An important aspect of their work involves the nonlinear effect of trend. Positive trends that occur within approximately 3.7 standard deviations have a positive effect. For stronger uptrends, there is a negative effect on returns, suggesting that profit taking occurs as the magnitude of the uptrend increases. For downtrends the situation is similar except that the &quot;buying on dips&quot; does not take place until the downtrend is a 4.6 standard deviation event. These methods can be used to examine investor behavior and compare the underlying strategies among different asset classes.

In 2013, Kim Man Lui and T Chong pointed out that the past findings on technical analysis mostly reported the profitability of specific trading rules for a given set of historical data. These past studies had not taken the human trader into consideration as no real-world trader would mechanically adopt signals from any technical analysis method. Therefore, to unveil the truth of technical analysis, we should get back to understand the performance between experienced and novice traders. If the market really walks randomly, there will be no difference between these two kinds of traders. However, it is found by experiment that traders who are more knowledgeable on technical analysis significantly outperform those who are less knowledgeable.

==Ticker-tape reading==

Until the mid-1960s, tape reading was a popular form of technical analysis. It consisted of reading market information such as price, volume, order size, and so on from a paper strip which ran through a machine called a stock ticker. Market data was sent to brokerage houses and to the homes and offices of the most active speculators. This system fell into disuse with the advent of electronic information panels in the late 60&#x27;s, and later computers, which allow for the easy preparation of charts.

Jesse Livermore, one of the most successful stock market operators of all time, was primarily concerned with ticker tape reading since a young age. He followed his own (mechanical) trading system (he called it the &#x27;market key&#x27;), which did not need charts, but was relying solely on price data. He described his market key in detail in his 1940s book &#x27;How to Trade in Stocks&#x27;. Livermore&#x27;s system was determining market phases (trend, correction etc.) via past price data. He also made use of volume data (which he estimated from how stocks behaved and via &#x27;market testing&#x27;, a process of testing market liquidity via sending in small market orders), as described in his 1940s book.

== Quotation board ==

Another form of technical analysis used so far was via interpretation of stock market data contained in quotation boards, that in the times before electronic screens, were huge chalkboards located in the stock exchanges, with data of the main financial assets listed on exchanges for analysis of their movements. It was manually updated with chalk, with the updates regarding some of these data being transmitted to environments outside of exchanges (such as brokerage houses, bucket shops, etc.) via the aforementioned tape, telegraph, telephone and later telex.

This analysis tool was used both, on the spot, mainly by market professionals, as well as by general public through the printed versions in newspapers showing the data of the negotiations of the previous day, for swing and position trades.

<doc id="112588" wikidata="Q2597205" url="?curid=112588" title="Fairland, Indiana">
<text>Fairland is a town in Brandywine Township, Shelby County, Indiana. The population was 315 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Construction of the Indianapolis, Cincinnati, and Lafayette Railroad began in 1849, and Fairland was platted in 1852. Isaac Odell and Henry Jenkins hired the J. M. Elliott Company of Shelby County to draw the plans, and this was recorded on October 21, 1852. The town was named for the &quot;beautiful land&quot; near the original town site. A post office has been in operation at Fairland since 1854 with Isaac Odell as the first postmaster. Several additions were made to the town: Daniel Bradley Addition (1857), Odell&#x27;s First Addition (1865), Granville S. Harrel Addition (1866), Odell&#x27;s Second Addition (1868), Richardson &amp; McQuiston Addition (1872), J. B. Plymate First Addition (1891), Joseph &amp; Luvina Plymate Addition (1902), Walker&#x27;s Addition (1903), Drake&#x27;s Addition (1907), and Henderson&#x27;s Addition (1914). In 1866, the railroad between Martinsville and Franklin was extended from Franklin to Fairland with General Ambrose E. Burnside leading the project. The Fairland Cemetery Association was formed in 1887.

The town boasted the 22-room Park Hotel, bank, blacksmith, physicians, restaurants, general store, hardware store, butcher, Masonic hall, lumber company, sawmill, and livery stable. And, the &quot;Fairland Bulletin&quot; newspaper was published until it was moved to Shelbyville and became the &quot;Volunteer&quot;.

On September 9, 1969, Allegheny Airlines Flight 853 collided in mid-air with a smaller private aircraft northwest of Fairland, killing all 83 passengers and crew of both aircraft.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Fairland has a total area of , all land.

==Government==
The community, located about five miles (8 km) northwest of Shelbyville, was incorporated as a town on June 9, 1866. Later on, for an undetermined reason, the town board stopped meeting. The town government came to a halt sometime after July 1883.

On August 16, 2008, for the first time in 125 years, a three-member Fairland Town Council and a town clerk-treasurer conducted official business. Shelby County Councilwoman Tami Grubbs administered the oath of office to board members Rick Daily, John Hanson and Jeremy Creech, along with Clerk-Treasurer Chris Brinson, who immediately set about the task of organization, which included electing board officials. The board elected Daily as board president, Hanson as vice president and Creech as secretary. Indiana law mandates that all municipalities with populations under 2,000 people are towns.

Fairland had its own high school at the turn of the 20th century. Fairland became an incorporated town, and by 1873, a new brick school was built to replace the two separate buildings formerly used. A new school was built in 1883, and when that one burned, another was built in 1928 and used until 1984. The Fairland athletic teams were the &quot;Hornets&quot; until they became part of the Northwestern Consolidated School District of Shelby County and became the &quot;Triton Tigers.&quot;

Triton Elementary School, Triton Middle School, and Triton Central High School, which make up the Triton Central Schools (formerly Northwestern Consolidated School District of Shelby County), are located approximately two miles north of the town of Fairland. The school colors are kelly green and white, and the mascot is the tiger.

Allegheny Airlines Flight 853 crashed on September 9, 1969, near Fairland. Nearly 30 of the 83 people killed were never identified and were buried in a mass grave in Shelbyville.

Prior to 1870, five years after the American Civil War and midway into the following Reconstruction era for the emancipated Southern slaves, now called freedmen. But no public education was provided for Shelbyville&#x27;s black residents. In that year, the state of Indiana required communities to provide free public education for all Indiana children, similar to that already available in most Eastern states since the 1840s, but allowed the various towns / counties to choose whether they would be racially integrated as in the North or segregated as beginning to be done in the coming &quot;Jim Crow&quot; era of the subsequent 1880s and after of a series of discrimination laws beginning in the South. In the Midwest region town of Shelbyville and its schools were for several decades since the beginning of the 20th century were racially integrated at the high school level, but segregated in the lower elementary grades until opened in 1949, five years before the landmark unanimous decision of the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas&quot; in May 1954 to outlaw legal segregation.

County Road 2050 North provides access to two hotels, a restaurant, gas station and residences that were formerly accessed from the old interchange of U.S. 231 with Interstate 64. That diamond interchange and overpass were eliminated in favor of a partial-cloverleaf interchange located slightly to the west, necessitating the access road.

Lincoln Pioneer Village, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is located in Rockport City Park. Designed by Indiana sculptor George Honig, the first phase of the Village was completed in 1935, with an addition completed the following year. The project was undertaken through grants from the Federal Emergency Relief Administration and Works Progress Administration, both programs of the &quot;New Deal&quot;.

Historically accurate replicas of a number of Spencer County cabins and businesses from Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s time are the main attraction of the Village, giving visitors the opportunity to see what it was like to live in Indiana during Lincoln&#x27;s formative years. The Village was so well known throughout the United States in its early years that it was chosen as the setting for portions of the 1955 Burt Lancaster film &quot;The Kentuckian&quot;.

<text>Mishawaka () is a city on the St. Joseph River, in Penn Township, St. Joseph County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 51,063 as of the 2020 census. Its nickname is &quot;the Princess City&quot;. Mishawaka is a principal city of the South Bend-Mishawaka, Indiana — Michigan, Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Mishawaka&#x27;s recorded history began with the discovery of bog iron deposits at the beginning of the 1830s. Settlers arriving to mine the deposits founded the town of St. Joseph Iron Works in 1831. Within a few years, the town had a blast furnace, a general store, a tavern, and about 200 residents. Business prospered, and in 1833 St. Joseph Iron Works, Indiana City, and two other adjacent small towns were incorporated to form the city of Mishawaka.

The Mishawaka post office has been in operation since 1833.

On June 27, 1859, a bridge carrying a train, which had over 150 people on board, collapsed, killing 60.

In September 1872, a fire destroyed three quarters of Mishawaka&#x27;s business district. However, the citizens rebuilt and attracted new industry. The Dodge Manufacturing Company, Perkins Windmills and the Mishawaka Woolen and Rubber Company (later Ball Band, then Uniroyal) all helped the town to prosper. Mishawaka grew through both industry and agriculture. In the late 19th century, Mishawaka became known as the &quot;Peppermint Capital of the World&quot;, as its rich black loam produced great quantities of mint.

From 1906 to 1915, Mishawaka was the manufacturing home of the luxurious American Simplex motor car. Ball Band made rubber garments and was hit by a major strike in 1931. It flourished in the 1940s, finally closing in 1997 in the face of cheaper imports. Manufacturing in Mishawaka peaked in the 1940s and began a slow decline due to industrial restructuring. The economic base shifted to retail services and small industry.

In 1979, University Park Mall opened in the far northern portion of Mishawaka. In 1990, AM General began producing the Hummer in its Mishawaka plant. The MV-1 is a purpose-built taxicab and replaces the planned Standard Taxi; it was developed in collaboration with AM General. The car is built in Mishawaka at an AM General plant. AM General has begun making Mercedes vehicles at this plant since 2015.

===Names===

One theory for the word Mishawaka proposes that it derives from the name of a Potawatomi village at the junction of the Elkhart and St. Joseph rivers, where there were many dead trees. The village&#x27;s exact name in the Potawatomi language may have been * (&quot;at the firewood-tree land&quot;). In the Miami-Illinois language, which historically was also spoken in the area, the corresponding placename is (&quot;it is firewood-tree land&quot;).

The most probable origin of the word comes from the city&#x27;s government website, where in a history of Mishawaka paper written by local historian Peter DeKever states, &quot;The Potawatomi had numerous villages in the region, including one on the south bank of the St. Joseph River located in the area bounded today by Lincolnway West and North Main and West Streets. The Potawatomi were drawn to this location by the ease of transport the river provided, a ford near a natural rapids, abundant fish and game, and access to timber. Their term for the area, M’Shehwahkeek, translates as swift flowing water or heavy timbered rapids.&quot; This theory is also mentioned by The History Museum of South Bend, and other sources.

The nickname &quot;Princess City&quot;, however, derives from a different account of the name&#x27;s origin. According to this story, &quot;Mishawaka&quot; or something similar was the name of the daughter of a Shawnee chief named &quot;Elkhart&quot;. A love triangle between Mishawaka, a white trader named &quot;Dead Shot&quot;, and a Shawnee warrior named &quot;Grey Wolf&quot; led to various adventures. This story originated with Flavius J. Littlejohn, a Michigan author, politician and judge, who published a collection of stories in 1875; in Littlejohn&#x27;s account, the woman&#x27;s name was &quot;Mishawaha&quot;.The story later became popular and help foster the legend that is known to this day.

==Geography==

<doc id="112607" wikidata="Q486877" url="?curid=112607" title="South Bend, Indiana">
<text>South Bend is a city in and the county seat of St. Joseph County, Indiana, United States, on the St. Joseph River near its southernmost bend, from which it derives its name. At the 2020 census, the city had a total of 103,453 residents and is the fourth-largest city in Indiana. Located just south of the border with Michigan, South Bend anchors the Michiana region and is east of downtown Chicago. The metropolitan area had a population of 324,501 in 2020, while its combined statistical area had 812,199.

The area was settled in the early 19th century by fur traders and was established as a city in 1865. The St. Joseph River shaped South Bend&#x27;s economy through the mid-20th century. River access assisted heavy industrial development such as that of the Studebaker Corporation, the Oliver Chilled Plow Company, and other large corporations.

The population of South Bend declined after 1960, when it peaked at 132,445. This was chiefly due to migration to suburban areas as well as the demise of Studebaker and other heavy industry. Today, the largest industries in South Bend are health care, education, small business, and tourism. Remaining large corporations based in the area include Crowe, Honeywell, and AM General. The city&#x27;s economy and culture are influenced by the nearby University of Notre Dame.

==History==

===Early history===
The St. Joseph Valley was long occupied by Native Americans. One of the earliest known groups to occupy what would later become northern Indiana was the Miami tribe. Later, the Potawatomi moved into the region, utilizing the rich food and natural resources found along the river. The Potawatomi occupied this region of Indiana until most of them were forcibly removed in the 1840s. The South Bend area was popular because its portage was the shortest overland route from the St. Joseph River to the Kankakee River. This route was used for centuries, first by the Native Americans, then by French explorers, missionaries and traders. The French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, the first white European to set foot in what is now South Bend, used this portage between the St. Joseph River and the Kankakee River in December 1679.

===First settlements===
The first permanent white settlers of South Bend were fur traders who established trading posts in the area. In 1820, Pierre Frieschutz Navarre arrived, representing the American Fur Company (AFC) of John Jacob Astor. He settled near what is now downtown South Bend. Alexis Coquillard, another agent of the AFC, established a trading post known as the Big St. Joseph Station. In 1827, Lathrop Minor Taylor established a post for Samuel Hanna and Company, in whose records the name St. Joseph&#x27;s, Indiana was used. By 1829, the town was growing, with Coquillard and Taylor emerging as leaders. They applied for a post office. Taylor was appointed postmaster, and the post office was designated as Southold, Allen County, Indiana. The following year, the name was changed to South Bend, probably to ease confusion, as several other communities were named Southold at the time.

In 1831, South Bend was laid out as the county seat and as one of the four original townships of St. Joseph County with 128 residents. That same year, Horatio Chapin moved to the settlement, opened the first general store with imported (out of state) goods and helped established the first church and Sunday school. Around the same time, design began on what would become the town of South Bend. The town was formally established in 1835, with Chapin as the first president of the board of town trustees. In 1856, attorney Andrew Anderson, Chapin&#x27;s son-in-law, founded May Oberfell Lorber, the oldest continuous business in St. Joseph County. He compiled a complete index of South Bend&#x27;s real estate records.
In 1841, Schuyler Colfax was appointed St. Joseph County deputy auditor. Colfax purchased the &quot;South Bend Free Press&quot; and then turned it into a pro-Whig newspaper, the &quot;St. Joseph Valley Register&quot;. He was a member of the state constitutional convention of 1850, at which he opposed the barring of African American migration to Indiana. He joined the Republican Party, like many Whigs of his day, and was elected to Congress in 1855, becoming Speaker of the House in 1863 during the administration of Abraham Lincoln. In 1868, he was elected vice president under Ulysses S. Grant. Colfax returned to South Bend after his stint in Washington and is buried in City Cemetery, west of downtown.

===Early business===
During the late 1830s through the 1850s, much of South Bend&#x27;s development centered on the industrial complex of factories located on the two races (man-made canals along the St. Joseph River in South Bend). Several dams were created and factories were built on each side of the river. On October 4, 1851, the first steam locomotive entered South Bend. This shifted commerce from the river to the railroad. In 1852, Henry Studebaker set up Studebaker wagon shop, later becoming the world&#x27;s largest wagon builder and the only one to later succeed as an automobile manufacturer. The Singer Sewing Company and the Oliver Chilled Plow Company were among other companies that made manufacturing the driving force in the South Bend economy until the mid-20th century. Another important economic act was the dredging of the Kankakee River in 1884 to create farmland. During this time period there was a great immigration of Europeans, such as Polish, Hungarian, Irish, German, Italian, and Swedish people to South Bend because of available employment in area factories.
South Bend benefited from its location on the Michigan Road, the main north–south artery of northern Indiana in the 19th century. Another significant development occurred near South Bend in 1842, when Father Edward Sorin founded the University of Notre Dame just north of the town. It became a major factor in the area&#x27;s economy and culture.

===Establishment and early history===
South Bend was incorporated as a city on May 22, 1865, and its first elections were held on June 5, 1865, with William G. George elected as its first mayor The official city motto, &quot;Peace&quot;, refers to the fact that incorporation came in the month following the Confederate surrender that effectively ended the American Civil War.

Industrial growth was rapid after the Civil War, most notably with the Studebaker wagon factory, and the Oliver plow company. Good jobs and high wages attracted immigrants from Europe, especially Germans, Irish, and Poles. The majority were Catholic, and they achieved higher rates of social mobility than the same ethnic groups in the Northeast.

Olivet African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church was founded in South Bend in March 1870, making it the first African American church in the city. Olivet AME is still an active African Methodist Episcopal Church, and celebrated its 145th anniversary in 2015.

A sergeant from South Bend fired the first American shells against Germany in World War I.

====History with Ku Klux Klan====
In 1923, the African American owner of a soda fountain received a letter signed &quot;KKK&quot;, threatening to kill an African American man held in the city&#x27;s jail and harm the rest of the city&#x27;s African American population. Within a few days, over a thousand African Americans fled the city.

In 1924, the Ku Klux Klan held a conference and planned a parade from its local headquarters at 230 S. Michigan St. In preparation, Klan members were posted around town to direct traffic. Notre Dame students, well aware of the anti-Catholic nature of the Klan, vigorously protested this intrusion, and before noon all of the Klansmen traffic directors had been &quot;unmasked and unrobed.&quot; Notre Dame students continued the fight, with several hundred gathering outside of the Klan headquarters, throwing rocks and smashing windows in protest. Local police as well as Notre Dame officials eventually managed to convince them to return to campus. It is said that even legendary football coach Knute Rockne became involved in the struggle to calm down the students.

===Later business===
Other industries developed in South Bend in the early 20th century, including Birdsell Manufacturing Company, the Bendix Corporation, Honeywell, AlliedSignal, South Bend Lathe Works, the O&#x27;Brien Paint Corp., the South Bend Toy Company, South Bend Range, South Bend Bait Company, and South Bend Watch Company. Workers at the Bendix Corporation staged the first sit-in strike in American history in 1936. Fast development led to the creation of electric rail transportation throughout the area, and in 1925, the South Shore interurban streetcar service was established from downtown South Bend to downtown Chicago. The South Shore line still runs daily to and from Chicago and also is a major freight carrier in the area.

On June 30, 1934, the Merchants National Bank in South Bend was the last bank to be robbed by the Dillinger gang.

===Recent history===
On September 29, 1929, South Bend completed its &quot;track elevation program&quot;. This was a railroad infrastructure project which saw the removal of Grand Trunk Western Railroad tracks from Division Street, the removal of level crossings from Chapin to Miami streets, the creation of a modern freight layout, and the construction of Union Station. This project had been seventeen years in the making, and had been the subject of the Indiana Supreme Court case Vandalia Railroad v. South Bend, which was subsequently affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States.

In 1949, legendary percussionist Lionel Hampton was informed that his concert at South Bend&#x27;s Palais du Royale would be a blacks-only event; he threatened to call for a boycott of the venue, and the affair proceeded as an integrated evening, which newspapers said led to all attendees breaking out in &quot;paroxysms of ecstasy&quot;.

By 1950, more than half of all employment was in the manufacturing sector. Due to economic difficulties, Studebaker closed its automotive manufacturing plants in South Bend in December 1963. A general decline in manufacturing soon followed as industry was restructured nationwide. By 2000, manufacturing was only 16 percent of the local economy. Due to the severe loss of jobs, the city&#x27;s population decreased by nearly 30,000 during that period. This decline of industry and population loss led to the Rust Belt designation for the northwestern and midwestern regions of the United States that experienced these effects of deindustrialization.

In 1984, South Bend community leaders began seeking a minor-league baseball team for the city. A stadium was constructed in 1986 and a 10-year player-development contract was signed with the Chicago White Sox. The team would be known as the South Bend White Sox. In 1994, the team&#x27;s name was changed to the South Bend Silver Hawks, and then to the South Bend Cubs in 2015. They are a Class A minor league affiliate of the Chicago Cubs in the Midwest League.

In 2015, the City of South Bend celebrated its 150th birthday. The yearlong festival culminated with the ceremonial illumination of the first River Lights along the St. Joseph River. Mayor Pete Buttigieg welcomed the coming of the next 150 years of South Bend&#x27;s heritage accompanied by five previous South Bend mayors: Steve Luecke, Joe Kernan, Roger Parent, Peter Nemeth and Jerry Miller.

In 2015, the city&#x27;s population increased by 286, the largest one-year growth in over twenty years. The former Studebaker plant has been developed as the Ignition Park center to attract new businesses, especially in the tech industry. South Bend has also seen new development, particularly in the tech field, a decline in unemployment, and a renewal of the downtown area under Buttigieg&#x27;s tenure, which has been described as a revival and South Bend as a &#x27;turnaround city&#x27;. South Bend also was in the national spotlight during the 2019-20 Democratic presidential campaign of former mayor Buttigieg.

==Economy==

South Bend&#x27;s location on the St. Joseph River led to an industrial-based economy in the late 19th century and early-to-mid-20th century. In 1923, industrialist and entrepreneur Vincent H. Bendix selected South Bend as the site of his new manufacturing plant for automotive parts. He chose South Bend primarily because it was on a rail line midway between Chicago and Detroit, the two automotive manufacturing centers of the United States at the time. Eventually, the Bendix corporation built a vast manufacturing complex on its South Bend acreage served by the major railroads, including a huge shipping and receiving building where railroad cars could enter at one end, unload, and depart at the opposite end.

By the end of World War II, manufacturing began to diminish. The Studebaker plant, which had at one time employed 45,000 persons, closed in 1963; its engine block plant shuttered the following year. Parts of the Bendix factory complex were later acquired and divided between Honeywell Corporation and Bosch Corporation, respectively. Honeywell Aerospace continues to manufacture aviation products at its former Bendix facility. In 2010, Bosch announced that it would cease all operations at its Bendix plant location in South Bend by the end of 2011. Bosch vacated the building entirely in October 2012. Curtis Products of South Bend moved into the building in May 2013.

===Employers===
Since the 1960s, education, health care, and small business have come to the forefront of South Bend&#x27;s economy, though the city has never regained the level of prosperity it enjoyed before that time. Nearby University of Notre Dame is a large contributor to the local economy. The university is the second largest employer in the city and in St. Joseph County, employing 6,086 people.

Health care is another major contributor to the South Bend economy. In 2012, Memorial Health System announced that it was merging with Elkhart General Hospital, located in Elkhart County, to form Beacon Health System. Beacon is the largest employer in the city and in St. Joseph County, employing 7,088 people. Other notable businesses include Honeywell, Bosch, and PEI Genesis. AM General, Crowe Horwath, and Tire Rack all have corporate headquarters in South Bend.

According to the 2017 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the city&#x27;s top employers are:

===Technology===
Efforts are under way to spur economic growth in South Bend. The St. Joe Valley Metronet is a dark fiber optic network that encircles South Bend and Mishawaka that allows for strong telecommunications connectivity. The South Bend Metronet, named Zing, is bringing more high-tech firms to the city and surrounding area. This telecommunications network has allowed for the advent of various data centers in South Bend, which serves as a hub between Chicago, Indianapolis, Detroit, and Cincinnati. In 2015, the City of South Bend announced it would provide free wireless internet access via the Metronet in the city&#x27;s downtown and East Bank areas.

The Union Station Technology Center was purchased from the city in 1979 and is currently Northern Indiana&#x27;s largest data center. There are currently plans to extend the data center into a fully operating high-tech data hub in the old Studebaker &quot;Ivy Tower&quot; assembly plant next door, creating what will be called the Renaissance District.

====Innovation Park and Ignition Park====
Innovation Park and Ignition Park, dual-certified technology parks, have attracted technology businesses to South Bend.

The first tenant, Data Realty, moved into the location in the fall of 2012. The second building in the new park, a research and testing facility for massive turbo machinery, is part of a partnership between the city, General Electric, Great Lakes Capital, Indiana Michigan Power, University of Notre Dame, and the state of Indiana.

===Redevelopment===
Redevelopment is underway for some of the abandoned industrial facilities, with the abandoned Oliver Corporation buildings being the most recent example of reclaimed property. The city also faced programs with large swaths of vacant housing after the decline of the manufacturing industry. In 2013, 1,347 homes were vacant or abandoned. The city created the Vacant and Abandoned Properties Initiative in February 2013, which aimed to take care of 1,000 vacant or abandoned homes in 1,000 days, either through demolition, repairs, or some other satisfactory means.

The Smart Street Initiative, a 20-year plan to make the city safer for pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists, began in 2013 with the conversion of one-way streets to two-way streets, to bring more businesses to the area, create shorter travel routes, and to reduce speeding. The other part of the initiative is the West Side Main Streets Plan, a revitalization plan for the Lincoln Way West and Western Avenue corridor focusing on guiding business owners, residents, and developers to improve the street front by offering a reimbursement on exterior improvements from the city and the Urban Enterprise Association.

The airport connects South Bend to larger hubs including Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Las Vegas, Minneapolis, Orlando, Phoenix, Punta Gorda, Sarasota, and St. Petersburg, Florida. In April 2014, the airport changed its name from &quot;South Bend Regional Airport&quot; to the current &quot;South Bend International&quot; after receiving International designation from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Final design plans are being approved for a Federal Inspection Station and General Aviation Facility. The airport welcomed its first international arrival through the General Aviation Facility in June 2017.

====Rail====
The South Shore Line, an electric commuter railroad, runs from South Bend Airport station seven times a day (five on weekends) to Millennium Station in downtown Chicago. A once-daily limited-stop express service was added in 2015 on weekdays, with trains taking 1 hour and 55 minutes from South Bend to Chicago. There is a proposal to reroute or extend the existing track southeast to a new terminus downtown South Bend.

Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to South Bend Station via two trains a day, the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; between Chicago and New York City or Boston, and the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; between Chicago and Washington, D.C. A bus line connects Notre Dame and the South Bend airport to Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare and Midway airports, with several northwest Indiana stops.

South Bend had electric streetcars from 1885 until the 1930s. In 2021, a group proposed the concept of building a new streetcar system, running from the University of Notre Dame, through South Bend, to Mishawaka.

===Utilities===
Electricity in South Bend is provided by Indiana Michigan Power, a subsidiary of American Electric Power. Natural gas is supplied by the Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO), a subsidiary of NiSource.

The South Bend Water Works deliver water to residents of South Bend. The water is collected from 32 deep wells and runs through of water main to be distributed to South Bend residents. In 2008, in order to increase the efficiency of its sewer system, South Bend began the installation of an array of intelligent sensors and valves allowing it to become the first city to migrate its sewer system management to the cloud. When a section of the system is under heavy use, this system can divert flow to other, less busy, sections. This more efficient system has helped to save the city an estimated $100 million in new sewage pipes.

===Law enforcement===

The police force in South Bend has undergone many changes and expansions in its history, starting in 1831 when the first constables were appointed. Law enforcement was reorganized and renamed multiple times throughout its history, until the department became officially known as the South Bend Police Department in 1903. Scott Ruszkowski has served as chief since 2015.

===Environmental initiatives===
In 2015, South Bend engaged in a partnership with the University of Notre Dame to revitalize the Bowman Creek ecosystem. Bowman Creek is a tributary of the St. Joseph River in South Bend that has suffered from contamination. The Bowman Creek initiative included partners from local high schools, colleges, and business leaders focused on improvements to both the creek and the neighborhoods. The vision for the collaboration is to institute a unique water quality monitoring system, similar to South Bend&#x27;s combined sewer overflow system.

<text>Walkerton is a town in Lincoln Township, St. Joseph County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 2,144 at the 2010 Census. It is part of the South Bend–Mishawaka, IN-MI, Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Walkerton was platted in 1856. It was named for John Walker, a railroad promoter. The town was laid out by the railroad surveyors and the first lot was taken by C.W.N. Stephens, Walkerton&#x27;s first postmaster. Stephens relocated his general store from nearby West York. The Walkerton post office has been in operation since 1860.

During World War II Walkerton housed some of the workers for the nearby Kingsbury Ordnance Plant. The plant initially sought 10,000 workers, and the entire population of LaPorte numbered only 16,000 in 1940. In August 1941 Kingsbury&#x27;s first shells were loaded and en route to the front lines.

In July 2006, Walkerton celebrated its sesquicentennial (150-year anniversary).

In April 2015, Walkerton gained national attention after the owners of the town&#x27;s local pizza parlor, Memories Pizza, became the first known Indiana business to advertise that it would not cater to a gay wedding after the passing of Indiana&#x27;s Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Walkerton has a total area of , all land.

<doc id="112610" wikidata="Q2619046" url="?curid=112610" title="Hamlet, Indiana">
<text>Hamlet is a town in Davis and Oregon Townships, Starke County, Indiana, United States. The population was 800 as of the 2010 census.

==History==
Hamlet was named after John Hamlet, who established the town in 1863.

Two railroad lines once existed in Hamlet, one being a division of the former mainline of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), running from Chicago, Illinois to Fort Wayne, Indiana, with the other line being the New York Central&#x27;s (NYC) Kankakee Belt, running from Elkhart, Indiana to Kankakee, Illinois. In 1968, these two railroads merged to become the Penn Central Railroad. In 1976, Penn Central, along with several other languishing eastern railroads, were in bankruptcy, and was part of the Federal Government&#x27;s takeover, creating Conrail. Both rail lines continued to see heavy use until the late 1970s under Conrail. By the early 1980s, the Kankakee Belt had been abandoned and removed, and the former PRR mainline&#x27;s traffic had dropped dramatically, due to redundant east/west Conrail lines. Today, what remains of the former PRR mainline is operated by the Chicago, Fort Wayne &amp; Eastern Railroad (CF&amp;E), which services Hamlet&#x27;s large CO-OP grain elevator during the fall harvest rush.

Hamlet was requested a Dollar General in 2020 and construction was completed in 2021. The Hamlet post office is in operation since 1864.

==Geography==

<text>San Pierre is a census-designated place (CDP) in Railroad Township, Starke County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 144 at the 2010 census.

==History==

Established and laid out in 1854, the area was originally called &quot;Culvertown&quot;, although a post office had been established as &quot;River&quot; in 1853. According to one local tradition, the village later took the name of &quot; San Pierre&quot;, named after a nearby French-Canadian saloon owner. The story goes that &#x27;Pierre&#x27; built a shack some 400 feet south of the village of Culvertown and began to sell whisky there. As a consequence of this inducement, the town shifted slightly to the south and the name was changed to &quot;San Pierre&quot;. Another tradition records the village being named after a French railroad worker called &#x27;Pierre&#x27;, with &quot;San&quot; being added to provide more importance to the name. In any case, the name was changed simply to &quot;Pierre&quot; in 1894, possibly as a result of increasing tension between Spain and the United States, leading up to the Spanish–American War. Finally the name was changed back to &quot;San Pierre&quot; in 1899.

==Sandhill Cranes==
Due to its closeness to the Jasper-Pulaski Fish and Wildlife Area, each year San Pierre and the surrounding vicinity is briefly home to more than 10,000 of the sandhill crane species of bird during their fall migration.

In 1914, the first hospital in Steuben County was opened in Fremont by Dr. Wade.

==Geography==
Fremont is located four miles east of the interchange between Interstate 69 and the Indiana Toll Road (Interstate 80/90) on State Road 120.

According to the 2010 census, Fremont has a total area of , of which (or 99.55%) is land and (or 0.45%) is water.

As an oddity, someone traveling due east from Fremont crosses into Michigan—not into Ohio. This is due to the early 19th century Ohio-Michigan boundary dispute over Toledo (q.v. Toledo War for details).

<text>Orland is a town located in the northwest corner of Steuben County, Indiana in Millgrove Township at the intersection of State Road 120 and State Road 327. The population was 434 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Orland is recognized as the first settlement in Steuben County,
populated by migrants from Vermont and originally known as Vermont Settlement. Each year in late July, Orland celebrates this heritage with the Vermont Settlement Festival. Orland was settled in 1834 after a Vermont man named John Stocker had gone prospecting for his family and the families of his neighbors. Stocker chose this particular piece of land because of the rich burr-oak openings he found. Pioneers coming from Windham County, Vermont, arrived shortly thereafter and built a Baptist church. The town established a post office in 1837.

In the decades leading up to the Civil War, Orland was a stop on the Underground Railroad, sheltering and protecting runaway slaves until they could complete the journey to Windsor, Upper Canada. The home of Russell Brown was said to contain a secret apartment on the second floor, complete with a separate stairway, in which 15 to 20 slaves might hide. S. U. Clark&#x27;s hotel also was said to have a secret hiding place behind a basement cupboard, while the Butler family south of Orland &quot;fed and sheltered scores of them and then took them on to other stations.&quot;

At one time or another during the period leading up to the Civil War, Brown, Clark, Benjamin Waterhouse, and Captain Samuel Barry were arrested for violating the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Both Waterhouse and Barry were convicted, with Barry serving one hour in jail and paying a $30 fine (although other sources put the fine at $1000).

Fawn River State Fish Hatchery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

During the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic, confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported on May 2, 2020, at a local meat processing plant run by Miller Poultry which resulted in sanitation of the plant and the implementation of safety measures such as temperature checks, social distancing &amp; available personal protective equipment for workers.

==History==

During pioneer times, the area was settled by the Methodists for the Bethel Church. A log building once stood within the limits of the present town, where the early settlers assembled for religious worship. On Busseron Creek was a grist mill erected about 1829. On the westside was one of the first coal mines of the county; it was owned by H. K. and Harvey Wilson. The coal was used chiefly by local blacksmiths.

Hymera was platted as a townsite &quot;circa&quot; 1870 by Nathan Hinkle.

Robert Linn had a general store on the site now occupied by the Odd Fellows block. For some years the store and post office, and two or three shops, comprised the business of the place.

When the post office was established the name Pittsburg was selected by the local community, in honor of William Pitt who owned the land on which Hymera was founded. However, the name was not accepted by the postal department. The post office was then established under the name Hymera, and has been in operation since 1855.

The origin of the name Hymera is credited to John Badders, who was postmaster. He had an adopted daughter, Mary.

The change of name for the village was accomplished in 1890. In April of that year, a petition from nearly all the voters of Pittsburg was laid before the county commissioners asking that the name of the town as recorded on the plat be changed to Hymera. A short time previously, on the opening of the new mine at Alum Cave, the new town laid out there was called New Pittsburg, while the Hymera community in distinction was referred to as Old Pittsburg. The resulting confusion brought about the change in name. About this time a branch line of railroad reached up to the coal mines in the vicinity, which led to tremendous growth. In 1902 Hymera was incorporated into a town. That July, the first election for town officers was held.

One of the memorable days in the history of Hymera was the celebration in October 1904, known as Mitchell Day, in honor of John Mitchell, the president of the United Mine Workers of America. The crowd in town was estimated at over seven-thousand. A delegation met Mitchell at Terre Haute, and the local procession was made up of the K. of P. Band, labor organizations, and school children. The ceremonies of the day centered about the unveiling of a monument to Nathan Hinkle, the Revolutionary soldier who was buried in the Hymera Cemetery. Hon. James S. Barcus, a great-grandson of Hinkle, delivered an address, and Miss Mamie Asbury, a great-granddaughter, assisted in the unveiling. The monument is fifteen feet high, representing a Revolutionary soldier at parade rest. The other events of the day were held in the Zink Grove, where speeches were made by Rev. A. P. Asbury and Robert W. Miers and John C. Chaney, and the principal address of the afternoon was delivered by Mitchell himself.

In the fall of 1905, Mitchell was reported to have said that Hymera was the neatest mining town in the United States, with more and better sidewalks according to its size than any town in the county, and many improvements indicating a progressive spirit among the citizens.

At the time, there were five church organization, the Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, United Brethren and Christian, the first two having good buildings, while the Presbyterians and U. B. were preparing to build. A five-room school building had proved inadequate, and a four-room addition was added in the summer of 1905. The Hymera State Bank, which had been organized in December 1903, as the Bank of Hymera, by S. M. Patton and R. I. Ladd, was reorganized as a state bank in January 1906, with Mr. Ladd as President and Mr. Patton, Cashier.
