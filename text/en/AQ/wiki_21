<text>Sausalito (Spanish for &quot;small willow grove&quot;) is a city in Marin County, California, United States, located southeast of Marin City, south-southeast of San Rafael, and about north of San Francisco from the Golden Gate Bridge.

Sausalito&#x27;s population was 7,269 as of the 2020 census. The community is situated near the northern end of the Golden Gate Bridge, and prior to the building of that bridge served as a terminus for rail, car, and ferry traffic.

Sausalito developed rapidly as a shipbuilding center in World War II, with its industrial character giving way in postwar years to a reputation as a wealthy and artistic enclave, a picturesque residential community (incorporating large numbers of houseboats), and a tourist destination. The city is adjacent to, and largely bounded by, the protected spaces of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area as well as the San Francisco Bay.

==Etymology==
The name of Sausalito comes from the Spanish &quot;sauzalito&quot;, meaning &quot;small willow grove&quot;, from &quot;sauce&quot; &quot;willow&quot; + collective derivative &quot;-al&quot; meaning &quot;place of abundance&quot; + diminutive suffix &quot;-ito&quot;; with orthographic corruption from &quot;z&quot; to &quot;s&quot; due to &quot;seseo&quot;. Early variants of the name included Saucelito, San Salita, San Saulito, San Salito, Sancolito, Sancilito, Sousolito, Sousalita, Sousilito, Salcido, Sausilito, and Sauz Saulita.

It is sometimes claimed that Sausalito was named for the district in Valparaíso, Chile, where the bandit Joaquín Murrieta was born. Murrieta was the leader of bandits who settled at the northern end of the future Golden Gate Bridge after being banned from San Francisco in the bandit wars. However, this theory is contradicted by sources which state Murrieta was from Mexico, not Chile, and because he did not arrive in California until the Gold Rush around 1849. The Rancho Saucelito had already been granted to William Richardson in 1838.

==Geography==
Located at , Sausalito encompasses both steep, wooded hillside and shoreline tidal flats. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . Notably, only of it is land. A full 21.54% of the city (0.5 square miles, or 1.3 km2) is underwater, and has been so since its founding in 1868. Prominent geographic features associated with Sausalito include Richardson Bay and Pine Point.

When Sausalito was formally platted, it was anticipated that future development might extend the shoreline with landfill, as had been the practice in neighboring San Francisco. As a result, entire streets, demarcated and given names like Pescadero, Eureka and Teutonia, remain beneath the surface of Richardson Bay. The legal, if not actual, presence of these streets has proved a contentious factor in public policy, because some houseboats float directly above them. According to the San Francisco &quot;Chronicle&quot;, &quot;State agencies say privately owned houseboats can&#x27;t be located above the underwater streets because the streets are public trust lands intended for public benefit.&quot; The California State Lands Commission is reportedly pursuing a compromise which would move not the houseboats, but the theoretical streets instead.

===Climate===
Sausalito has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csb&quot;) with far lower temperatures than expected because of its adjacency to San Francisco Bay and the resultant onshore breezes.

==History==

===Indigenous culture===
Sausalito was once the site of a Coast Miwok settlement known as Liwanelowa. The branch of the Coast Miwok living in this area were known as the Huimen (or as &quot;Nación de Uimen&quot; to the Spanish). Early explorers of the area described them as friendly and hospitable. According to Juan de Ayala, &quot;To all these advantages must be added the best of all, which is that the heathen Indians of the port are so faithful in their friendship and so docile in their disposition that I was greatly pleased to receive them on board.&quot; European settlers took advantage of the Huimen&#x27;s kindness and hospitality, and completely massacred them within the span of a few generations. As historian Jack Tracy has observed, &quot;Their dwellings on the site of Sausalito were explored and mapped in 1907, nearly a century and a half later, by an archaeological survey. By that time, nothing was left of the culture of those who had first enjoyed the natural treasures of the bay. The life of the Coastal Miwoks had been reduced to archaeological remnants, as though thousands of years had passed since their existence.&quot;

===European arrival and settlement===

The first European known to visit the present-day location of Sausalito was Don José de Cañizares, on August 5, 1775. Cañizares was head of an advance party dispatched by longboat from the ship &quot;San Carlos&quot;, searching for a suitable anchorage for the larger vessel. The crew of the &quot;San Carlos&quot; came ashore soon after, reporting friendly natives and teeming populations of deer, elk, bear, sea lions, seals and otters. More significantly for maritime purposes, they reported an abundance of large, mature timber in the hills, a valuable commodity for shipwrights in need of raw materials for masts, braces and planking.

Despite these and later positive reports, the Spanish colonial government of Upper California did little to establish a presence in the area. When a military garrison (now the Presidio of San Francisco) and a Franciscan mission (Mission Dolores) were founded the following year, they were situated on the opposite, southern shore of the bay, where no portage was necessary for overland traffic to and from Monterey, the regional capitol. As a result, the far shore of the Golden Gate strait would remain largely wilderness for another half-century.
The development of the area began at the instigation of William A. Richardson, who arrived in Upper California in 1822, shortly after Mexico had won its independence from Spain. An English mariner who had picked up a fluency in Spanish during his travels, he quickly became an influential presence in the now-Mexican territory. By 1825, Richardson had assumed Mexican citizenship, converted to Catholicism and married the daughter of Don Ignacio Martínez, commandant of the Presidio and holder of a large land grant. His ambitions now expanding to land holdings of his own, Richardson submitted a petition to Governor Echienda for a rancho in the headlands across the water from the Presidio, to be called &quot;Rancho Saucelito&quot;. &quot;Sausalito&quot; is believed to refer to a small cluster of willows, a moist-soil tree, indicating the presence of a freshwater spring.

Even before filing his claim, Richardson had used the spring as a watering station on the shores of what is now called Richardson Bay (an arm of the larger San Francisco Bay), selling fresh water to visiting vessels. However, his ownership of the land was legally tenuous: other claims had been submitted for the same region, and at any rate Mexican law reserved headlands for military uses, not private ownership. Richardson temporarily abandoned his claim and settled instead outside the Presidio, building the first permanent civilian home and laying out the street plan for the pueblo of Yerba Buena (present-day San Francisco). After years of lobbying and legal wrangling, Richardson was given clear title to all of Rancho del Sausalito on February 11, 1838.

===Fishing village and sybaritic enclave===
In the post-Gold Rush era, Sausalito&#x27;s unusual location became a key factor in its formation as a community. It was San Francisco&#x27;s nearest neighbor, less than two miles (3 km) away at the nearest point and easily seen from city streets, yet transportation factors rendered it effectively isolated. A boat could sail there in under half an hour, but wagons and carriages required an arduous skirting of the entire bay, a journey that could well exceed a hundred miles. As a result, the region was largely dominated by two disparate classes of people, both with ready access to boats: commercial fishermen and wealthy yachting enthusiasts.

===Mining town===
In the 1870s, manganese was discovered in the hills west of Old Town that was rich enough to justify small-scale mining. Tunnels were dug near the springs between present-day Prospect Avenue and Sausalito Boulevard. Henry Eames, an opportunistic inventor, built an ore reduction plant at the foot of Main Street to process the manganese ore. This location would become the later site of Sally Stanford’s infamous bordello, Valhalla. However, by 1880 the Saucelito Smelting Works was producing only about fifty tons of black oxide annually, hardly enough to make Sausalito a true mining center.

===Transit hub===
The first post office opened in 1870 as &quot;Saucelito&quot; and changed its name to the present spelling in 1887.
In the 1870s, the North Pacific Coast Railroad (NPC) extended its tracks southward to a new terminus in Sausalito, where a rail yard and ferry to San Francisco were established. The NPC was acquired by the North Shore Railroad in 1902, which in turn was absorbed in 1907 by the Southern Pacific affiliate, the Northwestern Pacific.

By 1926, a major auto ferry across the Golden Gate was established from the Sausalito Ferry Terminal, running to the Hyde Street Pier in San Francisco. This ferry was an integral part of old U.S. Highway 101, and a large influx of automobile traffic, often parked or idling in long queues, became a dominant characteristic of the town. Northwestern Pacific commuter train service also expanded to serve the increased traffic volume, and Sausalito became known primarily as a transportation hub.

This era came to an end in May 1937 with the opening of the Golden Gate Bridge. The bridge made large-scale ferry operations redundant, and since the new route of Highway 101 bypassed Sausalito entirely, in-town traffic was quickly reduced to a trickle. Car ferry service ended in March 1941 (passenger ferry service, however, continues to this day, linking downtown Sausalito with both the San Francisco Ferry Building in the Embarcadero, and Pier 39 in at Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf). Northwestern Pacific also closed its Sausalito terminal in March 1941, although some tracks remained in use as &quot;spur tracks&quot; for freight trains as late as 1971.
===Bootlegging and rum runners===
Sausalito was a center for bootlegging during the era of Prohibition in the United States. Because of its location facing the Golden Gate and isolated from San Francisco by the same waterway, it was also a favorite landing spot for rum runners. The 1942 film &quot;China Girl&quot; has some footage of Sally Stanford&#x27;s Valhalla restaurant on the waterfront. The scene shows the docks and illustrates rum running.

===Industrialization during World War II===
When the United States entered World War II, Fort Barry on Point Bonita was reoccupied. Fort Baker also hosted large numbers of troops. Barracks and other housing were constructed for soldiers. Few of these buildings remain.

A major shipyard of the Bechtel Corporation called Marinship was sited along the shoreline of Sausalito. The thousands of laborers who worked here were largely housed in a nearby community constructed for them called Marin City. The soil which supports this area is dredgings from Richardson Bay that were placed during World War II as part of the Marin Liberty Ship shipyards for the United States Navy. A total of were condemned by the government. A portion of this total area was formed in the shape of a peninsula and this peninsula became known as Schoonmaker Point. In honor of the city&#x27;s contribution to the war effort, a Tacoma-class frigate was christened the in 1943. The ship &quot;Sausalito&quot;, however, was not built in Sausalito but at one of the Kaiser Shipyards in Richmond, California, also on the San Francisco Bay.

The Marinship Shipyards were the site of incidents that provided a key early milestone in the civil rights movement. In 1944 in the case of &quot;James v. Marinship&quot; the California Supreme Court held that African Americans could not be excluded from jobs based on their race, even if the employer took no discriminatory actions. In the case of Joseph James, on whose behalf the suit was brought, the local Boilermakers Union excluded Blacks from membership and had a &quot;closed shop&quot; contract, forbidding the shipbuilder from employing anyone who was not a member of the union. African American workers could join an auxiliary of the union, which offered access to fewer jobs at lower pay. Future US Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall successfully argued the case, winning a ruling that the union be required to offer equal membership to African Americans. The court extended the ruling to apply explicitly to all unions and all workers in California.

===Postwar years===

Following World War II, the Marinship Shipyards site owner,&lt;ref name=&quot;shs/GW&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Donlon Arques,&lt;ref name=&quot;shs/DA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;as/RP&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a wealthy inland cattle ranch owner, who preferred hanging out in the junkyard, did basically nothing with the property and let nature take its course.&lt;ref name=&quot;theava/23500&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;People drifted in. The curious, the disenfranchised, bohemians... The shipyard was a treasure trove of junk, boats and barges in all possible conditions, a still-functioning marine ways. In the eyes of the square, &quot;normal&quot; Americans, it was a mess. To the creative, i.e., &quot;abnormal&quot; brain, it was a wonderland of seemingly unlimited potential.&quot;

A lively waterfront community grew out of the abandoned shipyards. By the late 1960s at least three houseboat communities occupied the waterfront along and adjacent to Sausalito&#x27;s shore. Beginning in the 1970s, an intense struggle erupted between houseboat residents and developers, dubbed the &quot;Houseboat Wars&quot;. Forced removals by county authorities and sabotage by some on the waterfront characterized this struggle. This long fight pitted the waterfront against the &quot;Hill People&quot; – the rich on the hill looking down on the waterfront. Today three houseboat communities still exist — Galilee Harbor in Sausalito, Waldo Point Harbor and the Gates Cooperative, just outside the city limit.

In 1965, the City of Sausalito sued the County of Marin and a developer from Bridgeport, Connecticut named Thomas Frouge&lt;ref name=&quot;bhc/CF&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for illegally zoning of land to build a city named Marincello adjacent to Sausalito.&lt;ref name=&quot;rb/mC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The city won the lawsuit in 1970, and the land was transferred as open space to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. In 1997, The New York Times compared Sausalito to Devonport in Auckland due to its setting and scenery.

In 1972, restaurateur and former San Francisco madam Sally Stanford was elected mayor of the town.

* Viña del Mar, Chile
* Sakaide, Kagawa, Japan
* Cascais, Portugal

Sakaide is near the Seto Ohashi Bridge on the north coast of the island of Shikoku in Japan (established in 1988). The primary program is a youth cultural exchange program.

Viña del Mar is located on the coast of Chile not far from Santiago (established 1960). The relationship features a Sausalito Stadium and a Sausalito Lagoon. Conversely, Sausalito&#x27;s main plaza is named Viña del Mar in honor of the Chilean city. The primary program is 777 (7 women, 7 days, 7 dreams), an entrepreneurial training for Chilean Woman in Sausalito.

Cascais is the newest sister city. This relationship was established in 2013.

==Media==
For several decades Sausalito had a local newspaper called the &quot;MarinScope&quot;, owned at times by Paul and Billy Anderson, and Vijay Mallya. However, as of 2018 the newspaper had ceased publication. Sausalito retains a small radio station founded by Jonathan Westerling, Radio Sausalito 1610 AM, which also serves as the city&#x27;s Emergency Broadcasting System. The city&#x27;s primary websites are the city&#x27;s official site ci.Sausalito.ca.us, the Chamber of Commerce sausalito.org, a reference site oursausalito.com and a guide for locals and visitors to the area Sausalito.com.

==Education==
Sausalito is served by the Sausalito Marin City School District for primary school and the Tamalpais Union High School District for secondary school. Effective 2021, the sole public school for the elementary district is Martin Luther King Jr. Academy, with preschool and middle school in Marin City and elementary school in Sausalito.

Previously residents had two public schools to choose from: the K-8 public school, then known as Bayside Martin Luther King Jr. Academy, or the K-8 charter school Willow Creek Academy in Sausalito. Willow Creek occupied ground of the former Bayside School in Sausalito.

There are two private elementary schools: The K-12 Waldorf-style New Village School, and PreK - 5 campus of the Lycée Français de San Francisco. Headlands Preparatory School offers personalized education for middle and high school students. High schoolers in public school attend Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley. 

Sausalito City Hall houses the Sausalito Public Library.

==Parks and recreation==

The public parks in Sausalito include Cazneau Playground, Cloud View Park, Dunphy Park, Gabrielson Park, Harrison Playground, Martin Luther King Park and Dog Park, Langendorf Park, Marinship Park, South View Park, Robin Sweeny Park, Tiffany Park, Vina del Mar Plaza, and Yee Tock Chee Park. The public beaches include Schoonmaker Beach, Swede&#x27;s Beach and Tiffany Beach. Sausalito also has a municipal fishing pier and the Turney Street Boat Ramp. A club house/game room and an exercise room are located in the city hall.

==Houseboats==

The Sausalito houseboat community consists of more than 400 houseboats of various shapes, sizes, and values, along the north end of town, approximately two miles from downtown. While some of these are technically outside the Sausalito city limits, they are generally acknowledged as forming an integral part of the Sausalito community.

The roots of the houseboat community lie in the re-use of abandoned boats and material after the de-commissioning of the Marinship shipyards at the end of World War II. Many anchor-outs came to the area, which created problems with sanitation and other issues. After a series of tense confrontations in the 1970s and 1980s, additional regulations were applied to the area and the great majority of boats were relocated to approved docks. From 77 boats in the water in 1977, there were about 18 boats left in 2019. Several are architect-designed pieces that have been featured in major magazines. The Gates Co-op Houseboat Community remains to this day, although recent action has required them to fit city standards of sanitation and building codes.

The humming toadfish makes mating noises underwater, keeping some residents awake at night.

<text>Stinson Beach is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Marin County, California, on the west coast of the United States. Stinson Beach is located east-southeast of Bolinas, right across the channel that terminates the bay mouth bar of the Bolinas Lagoon. at an elevation of . The population of the Stinson Beach CDP was 541 at the 2020 census.

Stinson Beach is about a 35-minute drive from the Golden Gate Bridge on California State Route 1 (the Shoreline Highway). It is near important attractions such as Muir Woods National Monument, Muir Beach, and Mount Tamalpais. 

Stinson Beach is a popular day trip for people in the San Francisco Bay Area and for tourists visiting Northern California. Although most visitors arrive by private car, Stinson Beach is linked to Marin City by a daily bus service, and the network of hiking trails around Mount Tamalpais also reaches the town. The beach is one of the cleanest in the state, and sandy, unlike the rockier neighboring beach in Bolinas.

==History==
Prior to the European colonization of California, the area was inhabited by groups of the Coast Miwok people.

Nathan H. Stinson bought land at the site in 1866.

In 1870, the first road was built along the Pacific coast from Sausalito, and a tent settlement sprang up amongst the willow trees at the beach, which gave rise to the town&#x27;s original name, Willow Camp. The Mt. Tamalpais &amp; Muir Woods Railway opened in 1896, making Willow Camp more accessible. Visitors could ride the train to West Point Inn and then hike or arrange a stagecoach to take them to the beach. In 1906, refugees from the San Francisco earthquake came to the area and built some of the area&#x27;s first businesses. Stinson Beach became the official town name in 1916, in honor of the largest landowners, Rose and Nathan Stinson.
The first post office opened in 1916.

In 1939, the beach was sold to Marin County. It was transferred to the state of California in 1950, and was eventually transferred to the National Park Service in 1977.

In 1963, Merrill and Joann Grohman started the &quot;Pacific Sun,&quot; Stinson Beach&#x27;s only newspaper of general circulation. It began operations in the back of a Stinson Beach&#x27;s larger grocery store, Bill&#x27;s Superette, in the space previously housing the Post Office. The &quot;Sun&quot; moved to San Rafael in 1966.

In 2002, a surfer was attacked by a great white shark while surfing off Stinson Beach. The young man survived, but received more than 100 stitches to close his wounds. The attack was the second in Stinson Beach, and the 13th in Marin County since 1952. In 1998, Jonathan Kathrein was attacked by a great white shark while bodyboarding. His injury from the shark bite required over 600 stitches. The surf off Stinson Beach is within an area known as the Red Triangle, where there have been an unusually high number of shark attacks.

Marin County added 12 tsunami warning signs to the Stinson Beach shoreline in 2012 to explain the risk to beachgoers.

Stinson Beach is in the Bolinas-Stinson Union School District, the Tamalpais Union High School District, and the Marin Community College District. Students in primary grades (K-2) attend Stinson Beach School, while elementary grade students (grades 3–8) attend Bolinas School. Stinson Beach is in the attendance area of Tamalpais High School, in Mill Valley.

==Government==
Stinson Beach is unincorporated, receiving general government services from Marin County, including law enforcement, land use planning, library, public health, and code enforcement. Three special districts provide local services. The Stinson Beach County Water District provides water and septic tank maintenance service and contracts for garbage and recycling collection. The Stinson Beach Volunteer Fire Protection District provides fire protection, emergency medical care, and disaster management services. The Marin County Flood Control and Water Conservation District administers programs which aim to mitigate flooding, historically concentrating on issues related to the flooding of Easkoot Creek.

==Community organizations==
The Stinson Beach Village Association was formed in 1976 to represent the town as the County developed the first Stinson Beach Community Plan. The Village Association&#x27;s current elected president is village resident Michael Matthews. Previously, development of the town had been promoted by the Stinson Beach Progressive Club, one of several non-profit organizations that formed the board of the Stinson Beach Community Center. The other founding organizations were the Allied Arts Club, the Stinson Beach Community Church, The Volunteer Fire Department, and the Parent-Teachers Club. The Community Center complex on Belvedere Avenue includes the Fire House, which fronts on Shoreline Highway, the Community Center, and the Chapel. The land was donated by the FitzHenrys and the other heirs of the Stinson families.

==Regional recreation areas==
* Audubon Canyon Ranch
* Golden Gate National Recreation Area
* Mount Tamalpais State Park
* Point Reyes National Seashore

==Annual events==
On the second Sunday of June, the town serves as the ending point for the annual running of the Dipsea Race, the second-oldest footrace in the U.S. The California Road Club holds its Mount Tamalpais Hill Climb, one of the oldest bicycle races in the West, in early fall. Since 2002, the race has been held on the third Saturday of the month, with about 400 bicyclists competing in the road race from Stinson to the head of Bolinas Lagoon and on to the West summit of Mount Tamalpais at Rock Spring.

&quot;Cuisine on the Green&quot; is a yearly event held in the town&#x27;s central park, the Village Green, each May. It features local restaurants and merchants selling a wide variety of foods, trinkets, clothing, art, and novelty items at different booths. Talent local to the area often performs on the small park stage. Cuisine on the Green benefits the Stinson Beach Community Center.

On July 4 of every year, a &quot;tug-of-war&quot; is held with Bolinas across the inlet dividing the two communities. Thirty women from each shore pull against each other until a winner is declared, and then 30 men from each take their turn. It is a slice of life, pure Americana, and always contested both during the actual event and then afterward in the local bars of Smiley&#x27;s and the Sand Dollar, where the winners&#x27; trophies are displayed.

<text>Strawberry is a census-designated place (CDP) and an unincorporated district of Marin County, California, United States. It shares a ZIP code (94941) with Mill Valley (hence, addresses in Strawberry are listed as &quot;Mill Valley&quot;) and falls within its school districts; however, it is considered within the sphere of influence of the town of Tiburon.

Strawberry is home to one public school, Strawberry Point School (K - 5), of the Mill Valley District.

Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary closed its Strawberry campus in 2016 after many decades of operation.

===Strawberry Point School===
Strawberry Point School opened in 1952. Starting in 1969, 6th, 7th and 8th grade students attended Mill Valley Middle School. Strawberry Point School closed in 1990 and reopened in 2000. Huey Lewis attended Strawberry Point School in the 1950s, where he skipped second grade.

The song &quot;Mill Valley&quot;, recorded in 1970 and released on the album &quot;Miss Abrams and the Strawberry Point 4th Grade Class&quot; , became a nationwide hit. (Listen to a clip of &quot;Mill Valley&quot;.)

===Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary===
The site of the Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary on Strawberry Point, now known as the Seminary at Strawberry, was considered for the headquarters for the United Nations. This was because in the 1940s when the UN was established in San Francisco, Strawberry was undeveloped. It was seen as a tranquil and peaceful setting. New York City was eventually chosen.

The site is currently occupied by Olivet University, also a theological institution. Olivet has approximately 100, mostly international students.

==Government==
Strawberry is unincorporated, receiving most of its general government services from Marin County. It is in the 3rd Supervisorial District and, in 2024, is represented by Supervisor Stephanie Moulton-Peters.

The Strawberry Recreation District provides limited services in the area, including recreation facilities. It has an elected board of five directors. District boundaries do not exactly match those of the CDP.

Strawberry is in the Southern Marin Fire Protection District, which also serves Tamalpais Valley, Homestead Valley, Almonte, Alto, part of the Town of Tiburon, and, since 2004, the City of Sausalito. Prior to the creation of the District in 1999, Strawberry was in the Alto-Richardson Fire Protection District.

Strawberry shares a ZIP code (94941) with Mill Valley (hence, addresses in Strawberry are listed as &quot;Mill Valley&quot;) and falls within its school districts. The city of Tiburon once considered Strawberry within its sphere of influence, but in 2004 the Marin Local Agency Formation Commission &quot;concluded that gradual annexation of Strawberry would be unlikely.&quot;

The population of Tiburon was 9,146 at the 2020 census and has 6,600 registered voters. Belvedere and Tiburon share a post office, library and recreation agency.
The city&#x27;s name derives from the Spanish word &quot;tiburón&quot;, which means &quot;shark&quot;. The name was first given to the peninsula on which the city is situated, and probably inspired by the prevalence of locally native leopard sharks in the surrounding waters. Tiburon was formerly the southern terminus of the San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad (subsequently the Northwestern Pacific Railroad), which transported freight for transfer to barges for shipping to cities around San Francisco Bay. It is now a commuter and tourist town, linked by fast ferry services to San Francisco and with a concentration of restaurants and clothes shops. It is the nearest mainland point to Angel Island and a regular ferry service connects to the island.

==History==
Earliest human habitation of the local area was by Native Americans, who have left rock carvings on Ring Mountain.

In 1884, the first post office in Tiburon opened. In 1964, Tiburon incorporated.

Much of the modern history material below is drawn from the former Town Historian, Branwell Fanning&#x27;s &quot;Brief History of Tiburon,&quot; published in the Town of Tiburon&#x27;s General Plan.

===1775–1882===
&quot;Tiburón&quot; means &quot;shark&quot; in Spanish. Whether Lt. Juan Manuel de Ayala saw a number of sharks near where he anchored the San Carlos in August 1775, off what is now Angel Island, or whether the tree-covered Tiburon Peninsula looked like a shark we may never know. He named the land &quot;Punta del Tiburón&quot;, or Shark Point. The Coast Miwok Indians had lived here for thousands of years, but there is no clear concept of what they called the peninsula.

John Reed, from Dublin, received a provisional grant for much of Southern Marin, including the Tiburon Peninsula, from the Mexican authorities in 1831, and was formally granted the Rancho Corte Madera del Presidio in 1834. Reed married Hilaria Sánchez, daughter of the &quot;commandante&quot; of the San Francisco Presidio in 1836. The Reed name is preserved on streets, subdivisions, and the local school district. Various forms of Hilaria&#x27;s name, and that of her granddaughter Hilarita Reed, are found on streets, a housing development, and the Catholic Church.

Hilarita married Dr. Benjamin Lyford, who became the first land developer with his Lyford&#x27;s Hygeia, now Old Tiburon. The Benjamin and Hilarita Lyford House, formerly located on their dairy farm on Strawberry Point, is now a feature of the Audubon Society&#x27;s Western Headquarters and Sanctuary on Greenwood Beach Road.

===Industrial era===

Life changed little in the 40 years between the death of John Reed in 1842 and the arrival of Peter Donahue in 1882. Donahue brought with him the San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad (later the Northwestern Pacific Railroad). He made a deal with the Reed family for a right-of-way, blasted out the rock at Point Tiburon, and built a railroad terminal to connect with ferries of San Francisco Bay. The passenger ferries took commuters and automobiles to San Francisco and Sausalito, while barges carried loaded freight cars to San Francisco and Richmond.

Wildflowers surround Old St. Hilary&#x27;s, Tiburon&#x27;s iconic hillside landmark, which was originally a mission church named for St. Hilaire, Bishop of Poitiers. The heirs of John Reed — who held title to El Rancho Corte Madera del Presidio, the Mexican land grant that included the Tiburon Peninsula — deeded the one-quarter-acre site for $2.00 to the Archdiocese of San Francisco, which built the church as a place of worship for local railroad workers in 1888. The church was deconsecrated to make way for a new, larger one and was headed for destruction until several individuals intent on preserving local history established the Landmarks Society and purchased the site and building in 1959. It has served as a schoolroom and town meeting hall and is now a popular setting for weddings, concerts and other memorable events.

The last railroad-operated passenger ferry left Tiburon in 1941, but passenger and freight trains ran until 1967. Passenger ferry service was resumed in the 1960s when Harbor Carriers utilized sightseeing boats in the early morning and evening hours. In the 1970s, the railroad removed trackage, plugged tunnels, and demolished the trestle over Trestle Glen and railroad ferry pier. The railroad roadbed was purchased by the City of Tiburon and currently serves as the waterfront rail trail. After years of hearings and studies, the former railroad yards became the Point Tiburon housing and commercial project.

During its heyday, the railroad-ferry service brought many other industries to Tiburon. Codfish canneries sprouted along the bay shore to can fish shipped from Alaska. Ship dismantlers broke up obsolete ocean-going vessels. In 1904, the Navy established a huge coaling station on the east shore of the peninsula on the site of one of the old fish canneries. Brick kilns were built and several powder plants opened, and oyster beds developed in the shallow waters of the bay. The rail yards were fully equipped to repair and service trains, and build rolling stock and locomotives.

Several of the largest San Francisco Bay ferries were built in the Tiburon yards. The Navy coaling station has played a prominent part in the history of both Tiburon and Bay Area at large. Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Great White Fleet was refueled there on its famous round-the-world cruise. Coaling service ended in 1931 and the California Maritime Academy moved in to train officers for the merchant fleet. Because the cranes remaining from coaling operations were operational, the company spinning cables for the Golden Gate Bridge set up shop.

===World War II===
As World War II loomed, the coaling station site was transformed into the United States Navy Net Depot Tiburon. This facility was used to manufacture and service nets used to stop enemy torpedoes and submarines from entering San Francisco Bay. Later, the U.S. Bureau of Mines and the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries established research facilities on the site, and the Coast Guard&#x27;s icebreakers made this their summer home. It is now the Romberg Tiburon Center for Environmental Studies operated by San Francisco State University.

With all the seamen, sailors, railroad workers, cannery employees, and local dairymen in Tiburon, the taverns and other attractions of Main Street were popular on Saturday night. Prohibition did not interrupt Main Street activities as the railroad workers were able to signal the Tiburon depot as soon as revenuers boarded a train or ferry headed for town. By the time they got to Tiburon, prayer meetings were being held in the taverns. The volunteer fire department organized spirited baseball games, and the Corinthian Yacht Club was in full swing, so Main Street was not the only activity center.

World War II brought more people to Tiburon as the Navy built housing for NetDepot workers on the site of the present Hilarita Housing, for sailors from submarines at an annex to the Net Depot (now Paradise Beach County Park). Real estate development was minimal until after the war. The descendants of the Reed family still controlled most of the land that was used for cattle ranching. Small areas of filled land were sold to create the Bel Aire and Belveron Gardens subdivisions. The Little Reed Ranch was sold and Hawthorne Terrace, Del Mar, and Reed Heights subdivisions were under way by the time the County finally began preparing a Master Plan for the Tiburon Peninsula.

After several years of public hearings and discussions with the primary landowners, a Master Plan was completed in 1956. It included freeways on both sides of the peninsula, a four lane &quot;ridge route&quot; down the center of the peninsula (with a high-level bridge over Trestle Glen Boulevard), a shopping center on the crest of Ring Mountain, and a bridge to San Francisco (via Angel Island and Alcatraz) off the end. A land-use density of two homes to the acre, plus areas zoned for apartments and duplexes, would have permitted 50,000 to 60,000 people to live in Tiburon.

===City incorporation and growth===

There had been numerous attempts to incorporate a City of Tiburon over the years, but they had all failed to come to a vote due to the opposition of the large land owners. The only semblance of local land use input came from the Tiburon Peninsula Coordinating Council (TPCC). This was made up of representatives of each of the home owners associations; the school, fire and sanitary districts; and the City of Belvedere. In 1963, after a number of adverse rulings by County planners regarding development on the Tiburon Peninsula, the leaders of the TPCC decided that another attempt to incorporate was justified. A separate incorporation committee was established and work began. The main issues were: revision of the 1956 Master Plan, improved police services, opposition to the bridge to San Francisco, preservation of open space, and a desire for responsive local government.

One of the first challenges to be decided was just what properties were to be included in the incorporated area. The mapping committee started with the Tiburon Fire Protection District map as a base. The properties of large land owners who had been able to frustrate previous attempts were eliminated from the map. Certain areas, such as the Reedlands and part of Belveron Gardens, which were outside the Tiburon Fire District, but which wanted to be in the new city, were added. Angel Island, also outside the fire district boundary, was more controversial. Most did not see any value to having it within the city limits, as it was a state park. The counter argument was that it was &quot;there&quot;, and we wanted a say in whatever future development might be planned. The County Boundary Commission (later Marin Local Agency Formation Commission, or LAFCO), at the time made up of the members of the board of supervisors, wanted it out of the new city because of potential sales tax revenues.

They finally yielded to arguments put forth by the incorporation committee, and let it remain within the new city limits. In March 1964 an election was held to create the Town of Tiburon, and on June 23, 1964, the incorporation was final and a town council seated, and mayor elected.

A city manager was hired and a contract for police services was made with the county sheriff. A Planning Commission was established and commissioners appointed. Offices at 80 Main Street were rented. To help plan for the future the Tiburon Advisory Committee was appointed, consisting of citizens who had been active in community affairs. Their report, issued in 1965, outlined goals in land use, recreation, traffic, and &quot;image&quot;.

In 1966, at the first election after incorporation, three of the incumbents were replaced. Over the next several years, the new city council strengthened the planning commission and divided it further into boards of design review and adjustments. They completed a new master plan and general plan for the peninsula and new zoning ordinances to implement the plans. They also created a parks and recreation commission. Special ordinances to protect trees and to protect views were created. Property values were rising faster than funds could be accumulated, so bonds were issued and several hundred acres of open space were acquired. Several hundred additional acres were purchased by the Nature Conservancy to permanently protect the ridgelines, and the city purchased additional land from the Navy. The railroad right-of-way, almost of frontage on Richardson Bay, was acquired for a rail trail.

One of the most difficult decisions involved traffic planning. After numerous public hearings it was finally decided that Tiburon Boulevard would remain a two-lane road east of Trestle Glen Boulevard traffic lights and turnouts were scheduled east of that point and eventually built. The four-lane bypass section from Highway 101 to Blackie&#x27;s Pasture (the old Tiburon Boulevard became Greenwood Beach Road) was completed in 1966. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) had anticipated extending the four lanes downtown, so the fill created during this project was placed in the Bay east of Blackie&#x27;s Pasture, and after the City did some land swapping with Caltrans, became McKegney Green and the park South of the Knoll Park. Blackie&#x27;s Pasture property was also acquired and became part of the series of waterfront parks and paths known as the Richardson Bay Lineal Park.

LAFCO determined that Tiburon&#x27;s sphere of influence would extend to Highway 101. Annexation of the rest of the peninsula was attempted but never successful due to opposition in Strawberry. Eventually, those areas that wished to be within the city limits were annexed, and the city grew westward to include the Reedland Woods, Bel Aire, Tiburon Crest and Cypress Hollow subdivisions.

===After 1997===
The completion of the Point Tiburon development in the former railroad yards in 1985 signaled a change in the population mix and needs of the area. In 1997 a new Town Hall was opened with a new Belvedere-Tiburon Library next door. A new police station followed in 2000.

Following a large and successful Millennium Party, the Town has pursued a policy to revitalize Main Street and the rest of downtown Tiburon. Main Street was reconstructed to make it and the shops and restaurants handicapped accessible without ruining its quaint charm. The Allan Thompson Walkway along the water side of Main Street was completely rebuilt. In the summer of 2004, a series of &quot;Friday Nights on Main Street&quot; community parties was inaugurated. Main Street was closed to automobile traffic on Friday nights during the summer and the restaurants created special menus for the occasion. Tables in the street in front of each restaurant added to the festivities. As of 2017, the festival continues.

In November 2006, a commissioned fountain with a nautically themed sculpture titled &quot;Coming About&quot; at the entrance to Main Street was formally dedicated. The $250,000 material cost of the sculpture was donated by the Zelinsky family, longtime owners of many commercial properties in Tiburon. The sculpture was designed by Jeffery Reed and Jennifer Madden, who donated 6,000 hours to its creation.

==Development==

Controversies surrounding development are significant public policy issues facing the town; this condition has endured for at least three decades.

At the lowest level, any new construction or exterior renovation, commercial or residential, must be approved by the design review board, which often applies stringent criteria to avoid &quot;eyesores&quot; and preserve neighbors&#x27; views.

More significantly, there remain several large tracts of undeveloped land, virtually all of which have owners who desire to build multiple residences on these properties. Many of these properties, while located on the Tiburon Peninsula, are outside of town boundaries. However, under a LAFCO policy, any urbanization of these lands would result in their being annexed by the town since it is the town that would provide needed services. Hence, it is the town planning commission and ultimately the town council that determines the extent that these lands can be developed. Major tracts of land currently in various stages of planning or permitting include the Martha Property, Easton Point and Tiburon Glen. The permitting processes in all cases are lengthy and contentious, pitting developers against active and organized residents seeking to preserve the open space and quasi-rural character of the area and avoid the kind of traffic seen by other Bay Area communities. Particularly active in opposing development is the Tiburon Last Chance Committee. No development has yet begun on any of these open tracts.

The Martha Co. property and Easton Point, the largest of the undeveloped lands, are particularly contested issues, with court battles dating back to 1975. Historically the Ring Mountain property was an area of contest, especially due to the high biodiversity and presence of rare and endangered species, such as the mariposa lily.

In 2002, residents in a referendum narrowly defeated a proposed rule that would have prohibited much of the development on open tracts of land by, among other things, banning development near ridgelines. Among the arguments against this proposal were that it would subject the town to costly lawsuits by developers claiming their economic rights had been unjustly impaired.

A 2006 controversy concerned the expansion plans of the Kol Shofar Synagogue. These were opposed by a number of neighbors, principally over the size of a new multi-purpose room, and the traffic and noise impact of a proposed 27 additional events with up to 250 persons. The Tiburon Planning Commission in the summer of 2006 rejected the expansion plans, claiming that Kol Shofar refused to engage in compromise discussions. This brought the issue to the Tiburon Town Council. In October 2006, the dispute took on broader significance when Kol Shofar proponents raised issues of religious freedom. Specifically, they claimed that the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), which prohibits &quot;substantial burdens&quot; on the exercise of religion by government regulations, would be violated if the Town prohibited their expansion plans. The synagogue retained The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which threatened litigation (depending on the outcome). The Tiburon City Council tried to resolve the issue late in the 2006 by permitting a somewhat reduced expansion with restrictions on event sizes and hours and provisions to mitigate the parking, noise and traffic impacts. However, in March 2007, a group of neighbors sued both the town and the synagogue, alleging environmental and land-use violations. In 2008, a Marin Superior Court judge ruled in favor of the expansion, and the Coalition filed an appeal with the 1st District Court of Appeal. The appeal was ultimately dropped later that same year, and Kol Shofar was able to proceed, agreeing not to seek repayment of court costs. Kol Shofar&#x27;s new space opened on August 29, 2010.

==Geography and climate==
Tiburon is located at .

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of . of it is land and of it (66.27%) is water, much in the form of Richardson Bay.

The serpentine soils of Ring Mountain and the Tiburon hills are host to a unique plant community, including several endemic or near-endemic species, notably, the Tiburon mariposa lily, the Tiburon indian paintbrush, and the Tiburon jewelflower, as well as a number of other rare and endangered species Ring Mountain is also a significant location of Native American prehistoric sites, notably rock carvings.

<text>Mariposa (; Spanish for &quot;Butterfly&quot;) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in and the county seat of Mariposa County, California, United States. The population was 1,526 at the 2020 census. Named for the monarch butterflies that there, the community&#x27;s history is deeply intertwined with the California Gold Rush of the 19th century.

During the California Gold Rush, prospectors flocked to Mariposa for its rich mineral resources in streams and underground veins. Among them was John C. Frémont, Mariposa&#x27;s most prominent resident, who leveraged his extensive mineral claims to achieve national prominence. He became the first U.S. senator from California and the inaugural Republican presidential candidate, significantly impacting both Mariposa and American politics during the 19th century&#x27;s period of expansion.

Today, Mariposa preserves its rich heritage through numerous museums and landmarks that highlight its mining history. The county&#x27;s proximity to Yosemite National Park also significantly contributes to its economy, with tourism playing a central role in supporting local businesses.

==Geography==
Mariposa is nestled at an elevation of in the rugged foothills of the Sierra Nevada. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covers a total area of , with nearly all of it being land. The community is situated in the valley of Mariposa Creek, which flows south then southwest into the San Joaquin Valley.

Major highways intersect in Mariposa; California State Route 49 and California State Route 140 merge for through the town&#x27;s main street. Route 49 extends southeast to Oakhurst and northwest to Coulterville, while Route 140 leads southwest to Merced in the San Joaquin Valley and northeast to Yosemite Valley.

The area&#x27;s soil predominantly consists of brown to reddish brown loam of the Blasingame series, and a gravelly loam known as the Boomer series. These soils support a thick grassland and diverse trees such as blue oak, black oak, gray pine, and ponderosa pine. To the west-northwest of the town, sparse vegetation and rockland are underlain by serpentine soil of the Henneke series.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Mariposa has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (abbreviated &quot;Csa&quot; on climate maps) and wet winters.

==History==
===Early Inhabitants and Spanish Naming===
Before Spanish arrival, the Southern Sierra Miwok lived in what is now Mariposa. In 1806, a Spanish priest traveling with early California explorer Gabriel Moraga named the area. When the expedition came upon a creek filled with thousands of yellow butterflies, they called it “Las Mariposas,” the Spanish word for butterflies.

===Rancho Las Mariposas===
In 1847, John C. Frémont purchased a 70-square-mile land parcel known as Las Mariposas for $3,000. Formerly owned by Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado, the ranch turned profitable once Frémont discovered a five-mile quartz vein producing hundreds of pounds of placer gold monthly. Its “floating grant” status, however, sparked extensive property and mineral-rights disputes. Squatters and mining companies contested ownership until 1856, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Frémont’s favor. The Mariposa Estate covered 44,000 acres in the heart of the Mother Lode region, where gold pockets in quartz veins could yield between $100 and $30,000. By 1915, total output surpassed $12 million in gold.

===Founding of Mariposa===
Mariposa’s rise as a gold rush boom town began along a seasonal trickle called Agua Fría, where prospectors—lured by tales of glimmering placer gold—pitched their first camp. When floods and fires during the winter of 1849–1850 forced them to higher ground, they relocated near Mariposa Creek, establishing a bustling county seat by 1851. The historic courthouse, completed in 1854, still stands.

===Mariposa War===

During the early 1850s, tensions between local Native tribes—primarily the Southern Sierra Miwok—and white settlers peaked, prompting the Mariposa War. The conflict stemmed largely from the presence of miners and the trading operations of James Savage along the Merced River and Mariposa Creek. Alarmed by escalating violence, Mariposa residents formed volunteer militias. With state backing, these militias eventually secured control of the area. Modern historians also consider the Mariposa War part of the California Genocide, and it indirectly led to the so-called “discovery” and naming of Yosemite Valley. By the late 19th century, many Miwok people had been forced from their ancestral lands.

===Twentieth Century and Beyond===
In 1914, voters in Mariposa County narrowly approved the creation of a county high school. Following a bond measure of $12,000 and the donation of nearly eight acres of land by the Mariposa Commercial and Mining Company, the school’s permanent campus opened in 1917. 

During World War II, the U.S. Army constructed the Mariposa Auxiliary Field (1942–1945) to train pilots; post-war, the site was redeveloped as today’s Mariposa-Yosemite Airport.

On July 18, 2017, the town was evacuated due to the rapidly spreading :Detwiler Fire, which threatened Mariposa and its surroundings.

==Demographics==

<text>Yosemite Valley (&quot;Yosemite&quot;, Miwok for &quot;killer&quot;) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Mariposa County, California, United States. It consists of the developed area of Yosemite Village and the other areas of the Yosemite Valley in Yosemite National Park. The population was 337 at the 2020 census.

Situated along the north side of the valley floor, its permanent population includes staff of the National Park Service, which administers the park, and some concession workers associated with various contracts in the park.

The village has some public facilities, such as a fire station, a post office (ZIP Code 95389), a medical clinic, a convenience store, restaurants, gift shops, and a school (kindergarten through eighth grade). The park&#x27;s headquarters facilities and its main visitor center are also located here.

The Yosemite Lodge is located at the west end of the village near Yosemite Falls. The Ahwahnee Hotel is a few blocks to the north. Both are operated by concessionaires under contract to the National Park Service. The architecture of Yosemite Village is characterized by shed style and makes extensive use of native woods. The earliest 20th-century buildings were designed by landscape architect Charles Punchard Jr., among others in the National Park Service.

A Miwok village called Hok-ok&#x27;-wi-dok (alternatively Hokokwito or Hococwedoc) was formerly located opposite the Yosemite falls, at the future site of the Hutchings Hotel in Yosemite Village. The first US post office opened in 1869, originally named &quot;Yo Semite&quot;. The spelling was changed to &quot;Yosemite&quot; in 1908 and to &quot;Yosemite National Park&quot; in 1922. In 1906, Major H.C. Benson was commanded to build and garrison Fort Yosemite in the valley. US Army troops were stationed at Fort Yosemite until 1916, when the National Park Service was established to administer Yosemite and other national parks.

Curry Village is one of the lodging options in the area.

== Geography ==
Yosemite Valley is located at (37.743324, -119.575724).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the community has a total area of , of which , or 2.88% are water. The Merced River flows westward through the center of the CDP.

=== Climate ===

Yosemite has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;), meaning most precipitation falls during the mild winter, and the other seasons are nearly dry (less than three percent of precipitation falls during the long, hot summers). Because of orographic lift, precipitation increases with elevation up to where it slowly decreases to the crest. Precipitation amounts vary from at elevation to at . Snow does not typically persist on the ground until November in the high country. It accumulates all winter and into March or early April.

Mean daily temperatures range from to at Tuolumne Meadows at . At the Wawona Entrance (elevation ), mean daily temperature ranges from . At the lower elevations below , temperatures are hotter; the mean daily high temperature at Yosemite Valley (elevation ) varies from . At elevations above , the hot, dry summer temperatures are moderated by frequent summer thunderstorms, along with snow that can persist into July. The combination of dry vegetation, low relative humidity, and thunderstorms results in frequent lightning-caused fires as well.

At the park headquarters, with an elevation of , January averages , while July averages , though in summer the nights are much cooler than the hot days. There are an average of 45.5 days with highs of or higher and an average of 105.6 nights with freezing temperatures. Freezing temperatures have been recorded in every month of the year. The record high temperature was on July 22 and July 24, 1915, while the record low temperature was on January 1, 2009. Average annual precipitation is nearly , falling on 67 days.

<doc id="107746" wikidata="Q579180" url="?curid=107746" title="Fort Bragg, California">
<text>Fort Bragg is a city along the North Coast of California in Mendocino County. The city is west of Willits, at an elevation of . Its population was 6,983 at the 2020 census.

Fort Bragg is a tourist destination because of its views of the Pacific Ocean. Among its notable points of interest are Glass Beach and the California Western Railroad (popularly known as the &quot;Skunk Train&quot;).

A California Historical Landmark, Fort Bragg was founded in 1857 prior to the American Civil War as a military garrison rather than a fortification. It was named after army officer Braxton Bragg, who at the time had served the U.S. in the Mexican–American War (and would later serve in the Confederate Army during the Civil War). The city was later incorporated in 1889.

== History ==

The area now known as Fort Bragg was home to Native Americans since before Western expansion, most of whom belong to the Pomo tribe. They historically were hunter-gatherers who lived along the northern coast of California.

=== 1855–1867 ===
In 1855, an exploration party from the Bureau of Indian Affairs visited the area looking for a site on which to establish a reservation; in the spring of 1856, the Mendocino Indian Reservation was established at Noyo. It was in size, and its boundary extended north from what is now Simpson Lane to Abalobadiah Creek and east from the Pacific Ocean to Bald Hill.

In the summer of 1857, 1st Lt. Horatio G. Gibson, then serving at the Presidio of San Francisco, established a military post on the reservation, approximately north of the Noyo River, and named it for his former commanding officer Capt. Braxton Bragg, who later became a General in the Army of the Confederacy.

Gibson and Company M, 3rd Artillery, left Fort Bragg in January 1859 to be replaced by Company D, 6th Infantry, which stayed for two years and continued to build up the post.

In June 1862, Company D, 2nd California Infantry, were ordered to garrison the post and remained until 1864. In October of that year, the Fort Bragg garrison was loaded aboard the steamer &quot;Panama&quot; and completed the evacuation and abandonment of Mendocino County&#x27;s first military post.

The Mendocino Indian Reservation was discontinued in March 1866, and the land was opened for settlement three years later.

The last remaining building of the Fort Bragg military post is located at 430 North Franklin Street. It may have been the Quartermaster&#x27;s storehouse and commissary or surgeon&#x27;s quarters or hospital.

The approximate boundaries of the fort extend from the south side of Laurel, east from the railroad depot to the carriage road behind Franklin, down the lane to a point south of Redwood Avenue, west on Redwood to just beyond the Georgia-Pacific Corporation company offices, then north to connect with the Laurel Street border at the railroad station.

=== 1867–1892 ===
By 1867, the reservation and military outpost at Fort Bragg were abandoned. By 1869, small lumber mills were being built at the mouth of every creek. Ranches were settled. By 1873, Fort Bragg had an established lumber port at Noyo.

In 1869, after the fort was abandoned, and the land surveyed by the U.S. Geological Survey, the land of the reservation was returned to the public and offered for sale at $1.25 per acre to settlers. In 1885, C. R. Johnson who, with partners Calvin Stewart and James Hunter, had been operating a sawmill in Mill Creek on the Ten Mile River, moved their mill machinery to Fort Bragg to take advantage of the harbor for shipping.

The company incorporated in 1885 as the Fort Bragg Redwood Company. In 1891, after merging with the Noyo River Lumber Company, it was renamed the Union Lumber Company.

The Fort Bragg Railroad was founded to haul logs to the mill. The first rails were run up Pudding Creek and, in 1887, reached Glen Blair. A San Francisco streetcar was purchased to carry loggers and their families on Sunday excursions to the woods.

Fort Bragg was incorporated in 1889 with C. R. Johnson as its first mayor, and Calvin Stewart drafting its plat maps.

Built in Fort Bragg for Horace Weller in 1886, the Weller House is the oldest existing house in the city. Since 1999, this house, converted into a hotel, has welcomed tourists from around the world.

=== 1893–1916 ===
The Union Lumber Company was incorporated in 1891 by absorbing some of the smaller lumber companies in the area. Some of the new company lands were in the Noyo River watershed east of Fort Bragg making removal of logs difficult by rail, unless a tunnel was built. Johnson hired experienced Chinese tunnel builders from San Francisco. After completion of the tunnel, most of the Chinese settled in Fort Bragg and Mendocino. A six-walled Chinese town was built at Redwood and McPherson. Older residents say that eventually most of the Chinese children moved elsewhere.

In 1901, the Union Lumber Company incorporated the National Steamship Company to carry lumber, passengers and supplies. As the only link to manufactured creature comforts, staples like sugar and coffee were delivered by steamship. In 1905, the California Western Railroad and Navigation Company was established and plans were pushed to get the rail line all the way to Willits, where train connections to the Northwestern Pacific would link to San Francisco.

The 1906 earthquake resulted in a fire that threatened the saw mill and the city. Within Fort Bragg itself, all brick buildings were damaged. Only two were not destroyed completely. Many frame houses were knocked off their piers. The fire downtown burned the entire block bordered by Franklin, Redwood and McPherson Streets, plus the west side of Franklin. The west Franklin block burned down to approximately one half a block beyond the intersection of Redwood and Franklin.

After the earthquake, most downtown reconstruction was completed within 12 months. Coincidentally, the earthquake brought real prosperity to Fort Bragg as the mills furnished lumber to rebuild San Francisco, and the lumber ships returning from San Francisco were ballasted with bricks used for rebuilding Fort Bragg. With the new prosperity, the rail line to Willits was completed and in 1912 the first tourists came to Fort Bragg. By 1916 Fort Bragg had become a popular place to visit—and to settle.

=== Since 1916 ===
Commercial fishing has also played an important role in the economic base of the community. Once a major commercial fishing port, Fort Bragg was well known for producing quality fish products that were distributed to major metropolitan markets.

In 1916, the Union Lumber Company built a railroad from the South Fork of Ten Mile River to Fort Bragg, where its operations were.
By 1929, what lumber could not be sent by rail to the company mill at Fort Bragg was handled by the mill at Pudding Creek owned by the Glen Blair Redwood Company.
The Union Lumber Company established its own post office on Churchman Creek to service its logging camps there in 1931, but it operated only until 1932.
The railroad was removed in 1945 as rail transport was replaced by haulage by truck; nowadays it is a recreational corridor in MacKerricher State Park.

In 1969, the Union Lumber Company was purchased by Boise Cascade and John Quincy and it became Georgia Pacific Lumber Company in 1973. The mill was shut down in 2002 after being identified as a nonperforming asset. The piece of property within the city limits takes up almost the entire coastline of Fort Bragg, including Fort Bragg Landing.

, the mill site was sold and is undergoing redevelopment, including removal of toxic waste.

====Calls to rename the city====
In 2015, members of the California Legislative Black Caucus petitioned Fort Bragg to change its name due to Braxton Bragg&#x27;s links to the Confederacy. The mayor of Fort Bragg at that time, Lindy Peters, stated that there was not really much interest among the residents, and cited the costs that every company and institution in the area would have to pay to change all of the addresses.

There were further calls to change the name in June 2020, following the murder of George Floyd. On June 22, the Fort Bragg City Council considered whether to put a proposition on the November ballot asking its residents if they would like a name change, but decided instead to form an ad hoc committee to explore options for the city&#x27;s name. They estimated the cost to change the name would be $271,000. Among the alternative options that were explored was to simply rededicate the city to a different notable person named Bragg. By late January 2022, the commission announced that it could not come to a consensus on a name change. Meanwhile in 2022, the active military fort of the same name in North Carolina was renamed to Fort Liberty. The military fort has since been renamed back to Fort Bragg since 2025, although now officially named for Roland L. Bragg, a World War II US Army paratrooper.

== Geography ==
Fort Bragg has an average elevation of above sea level.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , comprising 1.44%, is water.

== Climate ==
Due to Fort Bragg&#x27;s location on the shore of the Pacific Ocean, the city has very mild weather throughout the year compared to most inland places. Most of the rainfall occurs from November to April with some occasional drizzle or light showers during the summer. Fog and low overcast are common, especially during the night and early morning hours. The climate experienced in Fort Bragg is classified as warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;). Although formally known as dry-summer subtropical, Fort Bragg has very cool summer temperatures for a subtropical climate type. Its Mediterranean classification is due to the dry summers with very little rainfall.

Freezing temperatures occur on an average of 11.6 days annually. The record maximum temperature was on October 5, 1987. The record minimum temperature was on December 21, 1990, and in 2016 there was an ice storm. Winter days always remain well above freezing. The coldest day on record was in 1972 and the coolest day of the year reached on average during the 1991–2020 normals. The warmest night of the year averages a moderate and no overnight low has ever been recorded above .

Average annual precipitation is . The wettest “rain year” on record was from July 1997 to June 1998 with at least and the driest from July 1976 to June 1977 with . The maximum precipitation in one month was in January 1909. The maximum 24-hour rainfall was on February 6, 2015.

Snow has only ever been recorded on three days, the largest recorded total being on December 6, 1913, the second being on January 6, 1907, and the third being on January 12, 1907.

The extreme maritime effect of the Pacific Ocean is demonstrated by the fact that Fort Bragg has uniquely cool summers for cities on the 39th parallel north, both domestically and internationally. To illustrate the extremes of Fort Bragg, coastal climates with warmer summers than the city are found as far north as on the 66th latitude on the Bothnia Bay in between Sweden and Finland, a net latitudinal anomaly of 27 degrees. That is nearly one-third of the distance between the poles and the equator. In places some miles inland, consistently hotter summer temperatures are found, a phenomenon typical of the Californian coastline.

== Parks and recreation ==
A trail that extends over a mile along the coast from the Noyo River Headlands north along the bluff over the Pacific Ocean reaches the former Georgia-Pacific mill site. It is accessible from Highway 1 (Main Street) at Cypress Street. The trail includes information signage about the area&#x27;s pre-European residents, the Pomo Native Americans. The trail leads to a visitor center maintained by the Noyo Center for Marine Science. Offshore along the trail are rocks where harbor seals haul out and other sealife may be viewed.

== Arts and culture==
Built in 1892, the Guest House Museum served as lodging for the owners of Union Lumber Company, VIP visitors, and potential buyers of ULCO products. It has become the headquarters of the Fort Bragg-Mendocino Coast Historical Society, where visitors learn about the history of the area.

The Mendocino Coast Botanical Gardens is a garden along the coastal bluffs.

=== Glass Beach ===
Glass Beach is on the edge of Fort Bragg, along the ocean. In the early 20th century, Fort Bragg residents threw their household garbage over cliffs owned by the Union Lumber Company onto what is now Glass Beach, discarding glass, appliances, and even vehicles. Locals referred to it as &quot;The Dumps&quot;. Fires were lit to reduce the size of the trash pile. In 1967, city leaders closed the area and various cleanup programs were brought on through the years to fix the damage. Over several decades the pounding waves wore down the discarded glass into the small, smooth pieces called sea glass that coat the beach. The area along the beach at the end of Elm Street is now visited by tourists.

== Transportation ==
Fort Bragg is the western terminus of the California Western Railroad (otherwise known locally as the &quot;Skunk Train&quot;). Steam passenger service was started in 1904, and then extended in 1911 through the Coast Redwood forests to the city of Willits, inland. Started in 1885 as a rail route for moving large logs to the mills, the Skunk Train now offers scenic tours through the redwoods. In 1925 self-powered, yellow &quot;Skunk&quot; rail cars were inaugurated. The little trains were quickly nicknamed for their original gas engines, which prompted folks to say, &quot;You can smell &#x27;em before you can see &#x27;em.&quot; In 1965 the line reintroduced summer steam passenger service between Fort Bragg and Willits with Baldwin-built steam locomotives Nos. 45 and 46, calling the colorful train &quot;The Super Skunk&quot;. That train was discontinued in 2001 due to owing to the embargo of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad, then revived in September 2006 as a special event train, currently the most popular attraction for tourists in the Fort Bragg region. No.45 and 46 are now out of service waiting for overhaul. Trains continue with diesel locomotives used to power excursion trains from Fort Bragg as far as Northspur, the CWR&#x27;s midpoint, on selected weekends from summer to early autumn. 

State Route 1 (the Pacific Coast Highway) passes through Fort Bragg, concurrent with and signed as Main Street within the city limits. It travels on two bridges while doing so, the Noyo River Bridge and the Pudding Creek Bridge. State Route 20&#x27;s western terminus is in Fort Bragg at its junction with Route 1, traveling east it runs parallel and several miles south of the Skunk Train&#x27;s route to Willits and beyond to Nevada City before terminating at a junction with Interstate 80.

The city also has a small private airport, with an paved runway.

== Sister city ==

As a youth, Ken Sasaki noted that his home, Ōtsuchi, Japan, is located on the same latitude as Fort Bragg and in 2001 he contacted then-Mayor Lindy Peters and visited with a delegation to open discussions on a sister city agreement. Fort Bragg students visited Otsuchi in 2002 and the Sister City Proclamation was solidified in 2005 by Mayor Dave Turner. Other student exchanges were held in 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010 and the next exchange was planned for July 2011. Following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami devastation of Otsuchi, Mayor Turner ordered that city flags be flown at half staff until the end of March to honor the thousands of lives lost.

<text>Mendocino (Spanish for &quot;of Mendoza&quot;) is an unincorporated community in Mendocino County, California, United States. The name comes from Cape Mendocino to the north, named by early Spanish navigators in honor of Antonio de Mendoza, Viceroy of New Spain. Despite its small size, the town&#x27;s scenic location on a headland surrounded by the Pacific Ocean has made it extremely popular as an artists&#x27; colony and with vacationers.

Mendocino is located south of Fort Bragg at an elevation of . For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Mendocino as a census-designated place (CDP). The population of the CDP was 932 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

Prior to 1850, a Pomo settlement named Buldam was located near Mendocino on the north bank of the Big River. In 1850, the ship &quot;Frolic&quot; was wrecked a few miles north of Mendocino, at Point Cabrillo, and the investigation of the wreck by agents of Henry Meiggs sparked the development of the timber industry in the area. Mendocino itself was founded in 1852 as a logging community for what became the Mendocino Lumber Company, and was originally named &quot;Meiggsville&quot; after Meiggs. The town was also known as &quot;Big River&quot; Meiggstown, and &quot;Mendocino City&quot;, before the current name was settled on. The first post office opened in 1858. Many of the town&#x27;s early settlers were New Englanders, as was true of many older Northern California logging towns. Portuguese fishermen from the Azores also settled in the area, as did immigrants from Canton Province in China, who built the Taoist Temple of Kwan Tai in town.

Between 1940 and 1950, Mendocino’s population grew by 3%. In 2021, there was a water shortage which forced businesses to transport their own drinking water.

==Geography==
California State Route 1 (Shoreline Highway) runs along the eastern edge of the downtown area; it leads north to Fort Bragg and south to Manchester. Comptche-Ukiah Road departs east from Route 1 just south of the town, leading across the California Coast Ranges to Comptche, and to Ukiah, the Mendocino county seat. The Big River forms the southern edge of the community and joins the Pacific Ocean at Big River Beach within Mendocino Headlands State Park, a quarter mile south of the center of town.

The Census Bureau definition of the area may not precisely correspond to the local understanding of the community. According to the United States Census Bureau, the Mendocino CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 25.56%, are water.

In 2021, some aquifers feeding the settlement&#x27;s demand for water failed. Wells in the area are typically dug to a depth of . One well was dug to a depth of without successfully tapping into an aquifer. Water is now brought in by tankers, and local businesses have fitted chemical toilets to conserve water.

===Climate===
Summers are characterized by frequent fog and highs mostly in the upper sixties and lows in the fifties. Winters rarely, if ever, see frost or snow, due to close proximity to the Pacific Ocean. Mendocino averages about of rain per year, concentrated mainly in fall, winter, spring, and early summer.

==Economy==
Mendocino is home to a large number of hotels and bed and breakfasts. It has a downtown commercial district facing the ocean, with a number of art galleries, retail shops, lodging and restaurants.

Mendocino is one of the many small California towns facing severe water scarcity. Many of the region&#x27;s wells, the town&#x27;s primary water source, have run dry, so water is being brought in by truck at a cost of 20 to 45 cents per gallon. There are concerns that towns and cities in the county will stop selling water to Mendocino altogether: Fort Bragg, a city to the north, took this step in July 2021 because of concerns about their own water shortage.

==Arts and culture==
After the Mendocino Art Center was formed in 1959, Mendocino experienced a forty-year art renaissance, led by artist and real estate developer Bill Zacha.

Most of the town was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 as the Mendocino and Headlands Historic District. The Gothic Revival–style Mendocino Presbyterian Church on Main Street, dedicated on July 5, 1868, is one of the oldest continuously used Protestant churches in California, and is designated as California Historical Landmark #714. In addition, the Temple of Kwan Tai on Albion Street, California Historical Landmark #927, may be as old as 1854 and is one of the oldest Chinese houses of worship in California.

Since 1987, Mendocino has been the site of the Mendocino Music Festival, a classically based but musically diverse series of concerts that is held annually in a huge circus-type performance tent on the town&#x27;s Main Street in the Mendocino Headlands State Park.

The Kelley House Museum has a cannon from the &quot;Frolic&quot;.

The Mendocino Film Festival was first held in May 2006. As the area is a haven for artists, the festival honors them with a special &quot;artist category&quot;, in addition to the documentary, feature and short film categories.

==Politics==

== In popular culture ==

Many films and movies have been filmed in and around Mendocino and Mendocino County, including &quot;Dying Young&quot;, &quot;The Russians Are Coming&quot;; &quot;Overboard&quot;; &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot;; &quot;The Karate Kid Part III&quot;; &quot;Dead &amp; Buried&quot;; &quot;Forever Young&quot;; &quot;Same Time Next Year&quot;; &quot;Racing with the Moon&quot;; &quot;Pontiac Moon&quot;; and &quot;The Majestic&quot;. Mendocino was depicted as turn-of-the-20th-century Monterey in the James Dean classic &quot;East of Eden&quot;, and it served as a New England resort town in &quot;Summer of &#x27;42&quot; (the latter film featuring numerous local Mendocino High School students as extras).

The Sir Douglas Quintet had a number 27 hit with their song &quot;Mendocino&quot; (from the album of the same name) in early 1969.

The singers Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle wrote and sang the 1976 song &quot;Talk to Me of Mendocino&quot; about someone returning to the happiness of the town after unhappy experiences in New York.
The TV series &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; has had perhaps the largest impact on the community in recent years. &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; was set in the fictional town of Cabot Cove, Maine. Nine episodes of the 264-episode program were filmed in Mendocino, while exterior shots throughout Mendocino were used in the remaining episodes. The program was broadcast for 12 seasons, from September 1984 until May 1996 on CBS. Local residents looked forward to the yearly filming, as over a hundred and fifty were chosen to play background parts. A few were cast for speaking roles. Poet, playwright and actor Lawrence Bullock cites being cast in a speaking role as a &quot;Townsperson&quot; in the episode &quot;Indian Giver&quot; as giving him eligibility to join the Screen Actors&#x27; Guild. Locals, including Linda Pack and James Henderson, were also cast in speaking roles. The residence of the main character Jessica Fletcher was an actual home in Mendocino and is now a bed and breakfast under the name &quot;Blair House.&quot;

While scenes for &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; were being filmed in Mendocino, residents say that it was common to see Angela Lansbury, who played Jessica Fletcher, stop to speak with a toddler, or for Tom Bosley to sign his autograph on a Glad Bag box presented by a shopper stepping out of the local grocery store. &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; also brought in more money to the town due to increased tourism—by some estimates, around $2,000,000. The local high school band appeared in one of the episodes and received enough money from the appearance to go on a band trip.

&quot;Cliffs of Mendocino&quot;, a musical arrangement composed by Alan Lee Silva that is designed for developing middle and high school bands, was also inspired by and named after the community.

==Sister city==
Mendocino is a sister city with Miasa, Japan, a relationship formed due to the friendship of Mendocino artist Bill Zacha and Japanese artist Tōshi Yoshida that was formalized in 1980. Every other year, Miasa students visit Mendocino middle school students.

<text>Point Arena, formerly known as Punta Arena (Spanish for &quot;Sandy Point&quot;) is a small coastal city in Mendocino County, California, United States. Point Arena is located west of Hopland, at an elevation of . The population was 460 at the 2020 census, making it one of the smallest incorporated cities in the state.

Its main street is part of State Route 1, California&#x27;s coastal artery. Along with a number of other Mendocino County coastal communities, Point Arena was associated with the hippie and subsequent counterculture groups. The economy is largely geared toward serving the summertime tourist industry. The city is near the headquarters of the tribal lands of the Manchester Band of Pomo Indians of the Manchester Rancheria and adjacent to the recently formed Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands National Monument. Hiking trails with coastal prairie and ocean views can be accessed from Point Arena City Hall. At Arena Cove Historic District and pier, huge oceanfront bluffs show the power of the interface of tectonic plates.

== History ==

The first European to record Point Arena was Spaniard Bartolomé Ferrer in 1543, who named it &quot;Cabo de Fortunas&quot; (&quot;cape of fortunes&quot;). The cape was renamed to &quot;Punta Delgado&quot; (narrow point) in 1775 by lieutenant Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra (commander of the schooner &quot;Sonora&quot;), part of a royal expedition chartered by the government of Mexico to map the north coast of Alta California. Later the point, and the small harbor town south of it, were called &quot;Barra de Arena&quot; (i.e. sandbar) and finally &quot;Punta Arena&quot; (literally &quot;sand point&quot;).

The Punta Arena post office opened in 1858, and was renamed Point Arena in 1889. The first store at Point Arena opened in 1859. Point Arena incorporated in 1908.

In 1886, Nellie Welch, an 11-year-old girl, was appointed lead operator and had full charge of the telegraph office in Point Arena. Operators like Western Union often hired women because they were cheaper labor than the men.

The Point Arena Cable Station is located in nearby Manchester. Built in 1956 by AT&amp;T Corporation, the cable station serves as the eastern terminus of several undersea cables, including the Japan-US Cable Network and connections to Hawaii and Canada. In 2002, AT&amp;T applied for a permit from the EPA to connect an existing fiber optic conduit to the cable station, since further construction would cause incidental damage to the habitat of the endangered Point Arena mountain beaver.

==Ecology==

A variety of fauna and flora occur in the Point Arena area which is a range demarcation for occurrence of some species. For example, the California giant salamander occurs to the south while the Pacific giant salamander occurs to the north. It is also the type locality for the Point Arena mountain beaver, &quot;Aplodontia rufa nigra&quot;, which is federally listed under the Endangered Species Act as endangered, and is considered a mammalian species of special concern by the State of California. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the habitat for this subspecies of mountain beaver lies only within a area around Point Arena. The biggest threat to the PAMB is loss of habitat, and it was officially listed as an endangered species on December 12, 1991. Much local folklore revolves around this mysterious creature.

The Point Arena State Marine Reserve &amp; Point Arena State Marine Conservation Area are two marine protected areas that extend offshore from Point Arena. Sea Lion Cove State Marine Conservation Area and Saunders Reef State Marine Conservation Area lie south of Point Arena. Like underwater parks, these marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.

Sound levels in Point Arena are relatively quiet, with many locations at night-time dominated by natural sounds, such as those of the surf. The firm of Earth Metrics Inc., who prepared the &quot;Noise Element of the Point Arena General Plan&quot;, found that, even considering the presence of logging trucks on main city streets, composite sound levels rarely exceed 55 Leq. The maximum acceptable sound level specified in that General Plan Element is 60 Leq for residential areas.

<text>Ukiah ( ; Pomo: &quot;Yokáya&quot;, meaning &quot;deep valley&quot; or &quot;south valley&quot;) is the county seat and largest city of Mendocino County, in the North Coast region of California. Ukiah had a population of 16,607 at the 2020 census. With its accessible location along the U.S. Route 101 corridor, Ukiah serves as the city center for Mendocino County and much of neighboring Lake County.

==History==

The region has been inhabited by the Pomo for thousands of years. The modern area of Ukiah derives its name from the Pomo village (band) of Yokáya, meaning &quot;deep valley&quot; or &quot;south valley&quot;.

===Russian Era===
Russian American company led by commander Ross discovered Ukiah and the Russian River in 1750, during their exploration of the Alaskan Northwest and Hawaii. Eventually Point Cabrillo was discovered by the Spanish explorers, although Cabrillo only lived in San Diego and never visited the point. The land was inhabited by Pomo natives who lived as hunter gatherers until the time. Some Chinese explorers visited as well during the early times of Chinatown San Francisco and the building of the railroad lines.

===Mexican era===

Ukiah is located within Rancho Yokaya, one of several Spanish colonial land grants in what their colonists called &quot;Alta California&quot;. The Yokaya grant, which covered the majority of the Ukiah valley, was named for the Pomo word meaning &quot;deep valley.&quot; The Pomo are the indigenous people who occupied the area at the time of Spanish colonization.

Later European-American settlers adopted &quot;Ukiah&quot; as an anglicized version of this name for the city.

Cayetano Juárez was granted Ukiah by Alta California. He was known to have a neutral relationship with the local Pomo people. He sold a southern portion of the grant (toward present-day Hopland) to the Burke brothers. The first Anglo settler in the Ukiah area was John Parker, a &quot;vaquero&quot; who worked for pioneer cattleman James Black. Black had driven his stock up the Russian River valley and took over a block of grazing land at that locale. A crude blockhouse was constructed for Parker so he could have shelter to protect the herd from the hostile indigenous local people, who resented the squatters on their land. The blockhouse was located just south of present-day Ukiah on the banks of what was known as Wilson Creek. Following the U.S. Conquest of California, the region passed from Mexican to American sovereignty.

===Early American era===
In 1865, Samuel Lowry built a log cabin approximately on the corner of today&#x27;s East Perkins and North Main streets. Lowery sold his claim to A.T. Perkins in the spring of 1857, and the latter moved his family into the valley. They were the first Anglo-American pioneer family of the township. Six others followed to make their home there that same year. The first United States post office opened in 1858. By 1859, the population of Ukiah had grown to about 100 people, making it a community sufficient in size to serve as the county seat. Before this, administrative duties for Mendocino County had been handled by Sonoma County.

Initially visitors could reach town only by stagecoach, or private horses. A short rail line from San Francisco terminated in Petaluma, nearly to the south. In 1870 the remainder of the trip to Ukiah took another two days by horse. In subsequent years the rail line was extended further northward to Cloverdale. Although the stagecoach portion was reduced to , the community was still relatively isolated and slow to develop.

Ukiah was incorporated in 1876. It was not until 1889 that the San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad completed its line from Cloverdale to Ukiah, linking the Mendocino County seat to the national rail network.

Ukiah has been the hub of an agricultural and business community. Over the decades various commodity crops have been grown in the Ukiah Valley. They include pears, green beans, hops, apricots, and grapes. As part of California&#x27;s Wine Country, grapes have become the predominant agricultural product.

Hops were once a major crop grown around Ukiah. The beer flavoring agent was first grown there in 1868 when L.F. Long of Largo grew an initial experimental crop. The climate proved suitable for the crop and production expanded, peaking in 1885. It declined in the last years of the 1880s as prices dropped. Mendocino County remained the third-largest producer of hops in the state of California in 1890, with well over under cultivation. Production continued well into the 20th century. A refurbished hop kiln can be seen at the north end of Ukiah east of Highway 101, where many of the old fields were located.

===20th century===
Ukiah&#x27;s 20th-century population developed in relation to the lumber boom of the late 1940s. Logging of redwoods was once a major industry. Activists have worked to preserve areas of redwood forest, which became endangered due to overlogging. Young people entered the area from the 1960s, seeking alternative lifestyles and, in some cases, artisan and rural living.

==Geography==
Ukiah is in southeastern Mendocino County in the valley of the Russian River, a south-flowing river which reaches the Pacific in Sonoma County.

<text>Willits (formerly Little Lake and Willitsville) is a city in Mendocino County, California, United States. It is located about north-northwest of Ukiah, at an elevation of . The population was 4,988 at the 2020 census. Willits is at the center of Mendocino County and at the beginning of the county&#x27;s extensive redwood forests as approached by Highway 101 from the south.

An arch stands in the center of Willits featuring the slogans &quot;Gateway to the Redwoods&quot; and &quot;Heart of Mendocino County&quot;. The arch is the repurposed second version of the Reno Arch. Reno donated the arch to Willits in 1995.

==History==
Hiram Willits arrived from Indiana in 1857 to settle in the Little Lake Valley. Kirk Brier founded the settlement on Willits&#x27; land. Willits was originally called &quot;Willitsville&quot;. Later, when the post office opened in 1861, it was called &quot;Little Lake&quot;. The name changed to Willits in 1874. The community incorporated in 1888.


Little Lake was the scene of a legendary feud between the Frost and Coates families. The Frost family supported the Confederacy during the American Civil War, and the Coates family supported the Union. Both families were passionate in their beliefs. On October 16, 1867, Election Day, the long-running feud came to a head. A brawl turned into a shootout in front of Baechtel&#x27;s store, leaving Abraham Coates, Henry Coates, Albert Coates, Thomas Coates and Elisha Frost dead on the street. Three others were wounded.

In 1879, three men were charged with petty larceny, having been accused of stealing a saddle and harness. The three, it was later reported, had for years been involved in stealing, robbing smokehouses, drinking, and reckless discharging of their firearms. They were taken to Brown&#x27;s Little Lake Hotel to await the arrival of the circuit court judge. Following a meeting at Willits&#x27; Masonic Temple, 30 masked temple members seized the prisoners, and they were hanged from a nearby bridge. A newspaper reported there was no proof the murdered men were guilty of the charges.

Willits became a boomtown due to the tanbark industry. The 1970s &quot;back to the land&quot; homesteading movement paved the way for Willits&#x27; reputation as the solar capital of the world in the 1980s.

The Willits area is the final home of the racehorse Seabiscuit. Ridgewood Ranch, where Seabiscuit trained, recuperated, lived out his retirement and was buried, is located a few miles south of the city.

===Hexavalent chromium pollution and cleanup===
Beginning in 1996, the city and many residents became embroiled in lawsuits against the Whitman Corporation (later acquired by PepsiCo, Inc.), alleging that hexavalent chromium pollution left by a chrome plating plant, which operated in Willits from 1964 to 1995, was responsible for several local health problems. Activist Erin Brockovich, known for the eponymous movie about her work in a similar case, participated in a lawsuit on behalf of the plaintiffs. By 2003, plans were put into place to inject a solution into strategic wells at the site to neutralize the chromium and remediate the pollution on site. These plans successfully reduced the pollution, and further injections and a monitoring plan were implemented in 2005 and 2008. In 2011, various lawsuits were combined into a single suit involving paying for the site cleanup and payouts to affected individuals; most lawsuits were resolved in 2012.

<text>Dos Palos (Spanish for &quot;Two Timbers&quot;) is a city in southern Merced County, California, United States. Dos Palos is located south-southwest of Merced, the county seat, at an elevation of . The population was 5,798 at the 2020 census, up from 4,950 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Dos Palos is located in southern Merced County at . It is southeast of Los Banos and by road west of Madera.

==History==
In one of his expeditions during the 1820s along the west side of the San Joaquin Valley, explorer Gabriel Moraga reported the location of two large isolated poplar trees, which he called &quot;Dos Palos&quot;. In 19th-century Spanish usage, &quot;palos&quot; was used to describe tall pole-like trees or &quot;timbers&quot;. 21st-century usage often translates it as &quot;sticks&quot;. The &quot;Rancho Sanjon de Santa Rita&quot; Mexican land grant cites &quot;Los Dos Palos&quot; or &quot;The Two Trees&quot; as a boundary marker.

In 1891, former school superintendent Bernhard Marks convinced cattle ranch king Henry Miller to develop a small town nearby. They gave it the name &quot;Dos Palos Colony&quot; but pronounced it with their ethnic accents (Marks a Polish Jew and Miller an Alsatian German) as &quot;Dahce Palace&quot;. This pronunciation remained for over one hundred years until a recent Spanish pronunciation revival. Marks brought forty pioneer families west from Iowa and Nebraska to establish the community. In 1892, unable to find good water, many of the settlers left. Marks convinced Miller to establish another town two miles away on land unsuitable for farming and ranching due to swamps and unsettling soils. Some of the settlers relocated. This new town was named &quot;Colony Center&quot;. In 1906, Dos Palos Colony was renamed South Dos Palos and Colony Center was renamed Dos Palos. The Post Office was briefly misspelled as one word, &quot;Dospalos&quot; but this was changed within a year. About a dozen of the colony&#x27;s original families still reside locally. Through the years, people from many other locations joined the community. Dos Palos incorporated in 1935.

<text>Livingston is a city in Merced County, California, United States. Livingston is located west-northwest of Atwater, at an elevation of . According to the 2020 census, the city population was 14,172, up from 13,058 in 2010. Livingston&#x27;s total area is , including undeveloped farmland annexed in anticipation of future growth.

== Location ==
Livingston is located in northern Merced County at . It lies slightly uphill from where the Southern Pacific Railroad crosses the Merced River. Highway 99 follows the Southern Pacific through the town.

== History ==
The Livingston post office opened in 1873, closed in 1882, and re-opened in 1883. The town was named for Dr. David Livingstone, a Scottish explorer of Africa who was an international celebrity in the late 1800s. An error on the town&#x27;s post office application resulted in the difference in spelling between his name and the town&#x27;s.

== Agriculture ==
Livingston lies in the fertile San Joaquin Valley. Like the rest of the valley, it has long, dry summers and depends on irrigation water. The winters are mild, alternating between fog, rain, and sun, with occasional frost. The growing season is long, and there is a low risk of mold, drought, or bad weather interfering with crops. Due to deposits from the Merced River, Livingston&#x27;s soil is unusually sandy, distinguishing it from the clay-based soils predominant in most of the valley. Sweet potatoes and grapes are one of the most fertile crop in Livingston, and almonds are a fertile crop in the spring.

Livingston and Merced County are a center of the agriculture industry. Livingston&#x27;s largest businesses are agriculture-related. Among these are the largest poultry producer in the western United States, Foster Farms, and a dairy, Joseph Gallo Farms, which owns the largest dairy herd in the United States. Ninety percent of the sweet potatoes grown west of the Rockies are grown and packed in and around Livingston. The sweet potatoes benefit from the sandy soil. Grapes are also widely farmed near Livingston for wine, raisins, and table grapes. E &amp; J Gallo Winery operates a major grape-pressing facility just outside the city. Almond orchards are a common sight, and the Central Valley is a key part of California&#x27;s production of this crop (California produces 100% of the US domestic supply of almonds, and 80% of the world&#x27;s supply). Other crops are farmed in smaller quantities, including alfalfa, corn, soybeans, peaches, melons, berries, and turf.

The League of Independent Workers of the San Joaquin Valley and United Farm Workers are active in the area.

== Schools ==
Livingston Union School District serves 2,400 children in and around Livingston. The district operates three elementary schools, Campus Park Elementary School, Selma Herndon Elementary School, and Yamato Colony Elementary School. Most elementary-age children are within walking distance of each school. All three elementary schools offer some form of two-way immersion instruction designed to build proficiency in both English and Spanish. Livingston Middle School serves grades 6–8.

Livingston High School is part of Merced Union High School District and serves all of Livingston as well as students from the nearby towns of Ballico and Cressey. In years past, most students from Delhi attended Livingston High School until Delhi opened its own high school, Delhi High School, in 1998. Livingston High School&#x27;s foreign language department offers classes in Spanish and Punjabi.

Longview Mennonite School serves many Mennonite students in the area.

In the 1990s, Livingston schools were at the center of a controversy involving Sikh students&#x27; right to wear ceremonial daggers known as kirpans under clothing while at school. In 1995, a Federal appellate court affirmed the right to wear the kirpan if certain safety precautions are followed.

== Newspapers ==
The &quot;Livingston Chronicle&quot; is a weekly newspaper delivered on Saturdays. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; publishes local happenings, especially Livingston High School academic and athletic events. The &quot;Merced Sun-Star&quot; and &quot;Modesto Bee&quot; are also widely read and cover Livingston news and events. All three newspapers are owned by the McClatchy Company. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; is also available throughout the city.

== Churches ==
Places of worship in Livingston and the immediately surrounding area include St. Jude&#x27;s Thaddeus a Catholic church, an Apostolic Assembly, an Assemblies of God church, a Southern Baptist church, a Church of Christ, Lutheran and United Methodist churches, a Mennonite church, a United Pentecostal Church, and two Sikh Gurdwaras.

==History and culture==

The Los Banos area was initially settled, according to Mexican land-grant records, in the 1840s. The first white settler in the area was Uriah Wood, who built his two-room cabin in 1859. The original site of Los Banos was located several miles from the current town center, about a mile and half west of the railroad near present-day Volta. The town was essentially a trading post and received its name when the post office was established and the Post Office Department designated the office &quot;Los Banos&quot; after the nearby creek. When the railroad arrived, Los Banos relocated to its present-day site.
The first post office opened in 1873.

Land and water rights were important to early Los Banos residents, but those rights were recognized only when the land and deed were registered. Sometimes, those rights depended on fleet footedness, as it did in the &quot;race&quot; between Los Banos residents Uriah Wood and Henry Miller. Wood, whose homestead was located off of Badger Flat Road, raced Miller to the land office in Stockton to insure his claim to the land would be recognized. After crossing the San Joaquin River, Wood paid the ferryman $5 to hold the boat on the east side of the river to insure he would gain sufficient distance from Miller to ensure he would reach the land office first. Wood succeeded and the seven sections that he registered cost him only 45¢ an acre.

The centerpiece of downtown Los Banos is Henry Miller Plaza, honoring early California rancher Henry Miller. The half-oval public plaza features a monumental scale bronze arrangement of Miller with cattle. At one time in the late 19th century, Miller was the largest land owner in the United States. The success of his business monopolized the California agricultural industry, funneling resources and supplies to create his prosperous company. Centered around cattle farming, the Miller and Lux Corporation ultimately transformed the San Joaquin Valley into what can be considered as a precursor to corporate farming and turning independent farmers into wageworkers. His company, the Miller &amp; Lux Corporation, was headquartered in Los Banos on a site currently housing the Mexican restaurant España&#x27;s and the Canal Farm Inn.

Los Banos has a long history of Portuguese and Spanish immigrants, as do many of the nearby towns on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley. This is reflected both in local restaurants and in several festivals and parades that take place during the year. There is also a significant community of Basques. Los Banos is locally known for its annual May Day Fair during the first week of May.

Los Banos is home to The Randall Fawcett House, a Frank Lloyd Wright designed Usonian home.

A member of the Manson family, Susan Atkins attended Los Banos High School, before joining the family.

Since the 1980s, the city&#x27;s population has changed with a continuing influx of people who work in the San Jose/Silicon Valley area but seek more affordable housing and slower pace of semi-rural life, a pattern seen in many other small towns within commuting distance of Silicon Valley.

* California Historical Landmark Canal Farm Inn is located at 1460 E Pacheco Blvd, Los Banos. Canal Farm Inn is a California Historical Landmarks, number 548.
The California Historical Landmark reads:
:&quot;NO. 548 CANAL FARM INN – This original San Joaquin Valley ranch headquarters of California pioneer and cattle baron Henry Miller (1827–1916) was established in 1873. His farsighted planning and development in the 1870s of a vast gravity irrigation system, and the founding of Los Banos in 1889, provided the basis for this area&#x27;s present stability and wealth.&quot; 

==Notable people==
*Mack Wheat, (1893–1979), was a Major League Baseball catcher from 1915 to 1921 for Brooklyn and the Philadelphia Phillies.

==Education==
K–12 education is provided by the Los Banos Unified School District. In addition, the Los Banos Campus of Merced College has served community college students since 2007.

The San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Railroad (built in the late 1890s) had a &quot;Geneva&quot; station which became the &quot;Planada&quot; station.

Since many of Planada&#x27;s residents - as many as 41 percent - are undocumented, they were ineligible for most federal aid. In July, the state legislature passed a bill to provide assistance to Planada residents.

<text>Alturas (Spanish for &quot;Heights&quot;; Achumawi: &quot;Kasalektawi&quot;) is the only incorporated city in Modoc County, California of which it is also the county seat. Located in the Shasta Cascade region of Northern California, the city had a population of 2,715 at the 2020 census.

Alturas is the headquarters to the Modoc National Forest, the Applegate Field Office of the Bureau of Land Management, the Modoc National Wildlife Refuge and other recreation areas, and is the trade center for the agricultural region, which produces beef, sheep, potatoes, alfalfa and lumber. Despite its abundance of wilderness, recreational opportunities, hunting and fishing resources, and natural environment, tourism is not a major sector of the local economy – largely due to the city&#x27;s remote location.

Local, State, Federal, and Tribal governments are the largest employers in Alturas. A vibrant timber industry collapsed in the early 1980s due to increased production costs and low market prices for softwood lumber.

The Modoc Joint Unified School District is headquartered in Alturas.

The Alturas Rancheria, a band of Pit River Indians, operates a small casino just outside the city limits.

<doc id="107765" wikidata="Q983604" url="?curid=107765" title="Mammoth Lakes, California">
<text>Mammoth Lakes is the only incorporated town in Mono County, California, United States. It is located immediately to the east of Mammoth Mountain, at an elevation of . As of the 2020 United States Census, the population was 7,191, reflecting a 12.7% decrease from the 2010 Census.

==History==
The Mono people were the first settlers of the Mammoth Lakes area, thousands of years ago. They settled in the valley but traveled by foot to other areas when trading with different tribes.

The European history of Mammoth Lakes started in 1877, when four prospectors staked a claim on Mineral Hill, south of the current town, along Old Mammoth Road. In 1878, the Mammoth Mining Company was organized to mine Mineral Hill, which caused a gold rush. By the end of 1878, 1500 people settled in the mining camp called Mammoth City. By 1880, the company had shut down, and by 1888, the population declined to less than 10 people. By the early 1900s, the town of Mammoth was informally established near Mammoth Creek. The economy of the original town was based on logging and tourism. The first post office at Mammoth Lakes opened in 1923.

In 1971, a group of Mammoth Lakes residents filed a lawsuit against two proposed apartment buildings, arguing the development violated the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Prior to the lawsuit, CEQA was commonly understood as only applying to publicly funded developments. In 1972, the California Supreme Court ruled the developer required an environmental impact study. Known as the Friends of Mammoth Interpretive Principle, the decision set the precedent of requiring all public or private developments in California that required government authorization, be subject to the CEQA rules.

In 2004, the Mammoth Ski Museum opened in town. The museum featured many vintage artifacts, photographs, and posters. A movie documenting the life of the founder of the ski resort (Dave McCoy) and those of early famous skiers in the area is shown. In 2010, photographs taken by Dave McCoy were featured in an exhibit at the museum.

In 2008, after a jury trial, the Mono County Superior Court entered a $43 million judgment against the Town of Mammoth Lakes for breach of a development agreement. The California Court of Appeal, Third District, affirmed the judgment in December 2010, and the California Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal on March 23, 2011. On Monday July 2, 2012, Mammoth Lakes filed for bankruptcy in the face of the judgement. Later the same year, the bankruptcy was dismissed as a result of a settlement between the town and its largest creditor.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land, and (1.74%) water.

Mammoth Lakes lies on the edge of the Long Valley Caldera. The area around the town is geologically active, with hot springs and rhyolite domes that are less than 1000 years old.

Visitors can take State Route 203 from the town of Mammoth Lakes to the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area, over Minaret Summit, then down to Devils Postpile National Monument, with access to the Ansel Adams Wilderness.

The area has natural hot springs, some of which offer bathing opportunities and are popular with both locals and visitors. Other features include lakes, soda springs, and an obsidian dome. Mammoth Lakes is north of the Owens Valley, a scenic area with extensive hiking opportunities. Lake Mary is south of the town and has recreation facilities.

The town is surrounded by mountains: on the west, Mammoth Mountain looms over the town, while to the south, the Sherwin Range dominates the view. This hilly terrain and the high altitude makes the area great for high-altitude athletic training, including among elite long-distance runners, who live and train in the thin air.

==Economy==
Mammoth Lakes&#x27; economy is primarily tourism-based. A 13% tax is added to the rental of any lodging facility and campgrounds for stays of less than a month. There are more than 4,599 rental units in Mammoth Lakes and the lodging industry generates around two-thirds of the gross revenue of the Town of Mammoth Lakes. As well as the pull from winter extreme sports, Mammoth Lakes also benefits greatly from tourism in the summer from people who visit to camp, hike and fish.

The Mammoth Lakes real estate market has gone through ups and downs over the past few decades. In 1980, an earthquake with magnitude of 6.1 on the Richter scale sent area property values plummeting on fears of a potential volcanic eruption similar to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. A significant real estate surplus formed after this, during which Mammoth Lakes had a total of over 1200 properties on the market. The development of the Mammoth Mountain ski area has had a direct effect on housing in more recent years. The tourist market has led to an explosion of property values. This peaked in 2003 when the median property value reached $750,000. Another peak occurred in 2006 with the sale of the Mammoth Mountain ski area to Starwood Capital Group.
As of August 2022, the median listing price was again $752,000.

<text>Carmel-by-the-Sea (), commonly known simply as Carmel, is a city in Monterey County, California, located on the Central Coast of California. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 3,220, down from 3,722 at the 2010 census. Situated on the Monterey Peninsula, Carmel is a tourist destination, known for its natural scenery and artistic history. 

The Spanish founded a settlement in 1797, when Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo was relocated by St. Junípero Serra from Monterey. Mission Carmel served as the headquarters of the Californian mission system, until the Mexican secularization act of 1833, when the area was divided into rancho grants. The settlement was largely abandoned by the U.S. Conquest of California in 1848 and stayed undeveloped until Santiago J. Duckworth set out to build a summer colony in 1888. When the Carmel Development Company was formed in 1902, Carmel became an art colony and seaside resort, which incorporated in 1916.

==History==

=== Spanish and Mexican eras ===

The first Europeans to see Carmel were mariners led by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo in 1542, who sailed up the California coast without landing. Another sixty years passed before Spanish explorer, Sebastián Vizcaíno landed in what is now known as Carmel Valley in 1602. It is thought that he named the river running through the valley Rio Carmelo in honor of the three Carmelite friars serving as chaplains for the voyage.

The Spanish did not attempt to colonize the area until 1770, when Gaspar de Portolá, along with Franciscan priests Junípero Serra and Juan Crespí, visited the area in search of a mission site. Portolà and Crespí traveled by land while Serra traveled with supplies aboard ship, arriving eight days later. The colony of Monterey was established at the same time as the second mission in Alta California and soon became the capital of California, remaining so until 1849. From the late 18th through the early 19th century most of the Ohlone population died from European diseases (against which they had no immunity), as well as overwork and malnutrition at the missions where the Spanish forced them to live. 

Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo was founded on June 3, 1770, in the nearby settlement of Monterey, but was relocated to Carmel Valley by Junípero Serra due to interactions between soldiers stationed at the nearby Presidio and the native Indians.

In December 1771, a stockade of approximately 130x200 became the new Mission Carmel. Simple buildings of plastered mud were the first church and dwellings until a structure was built of wood from nearby pine and cypress trees to last through the seasonal rains. This too, was a temporary church until a permanent stone edifice was built. In 1784, Serra died and was buried, at his request, at the Mission in the Sanctuary of the San Carlos Church, next to Crespí, who had died the previous year. Serra was buried with full military honors. Carmel Mission contains the state&#x27;s first library.

When Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, Carmel became Mexican territory.

=== Early American era ===

Carmel became part of the United States in 1848, when Mexico ceded California as a result of the Mexican–American War.
In the 1850s, &quot;Rancho Las Manzanitas&quot;, the area that was to become Carmel-by-the-Sea, was purchased by French businessman Honoré Escolle. Escolle was known and prosperous in the City of Monterey, owning the first commercial bakery, pottery kiln, and brickworks in Central California.

William Martin of Scotland arrived in Monterey in 1856 by ship with his family. His son, John Martin (1827–1893), bought land around the Carmel River from Lafayette F. Loveland in 1859. He built the Martin Ranch on that went as far as the Carmel River to the homes along Carmel-by-the-Sea. The ranch became known as the Mission Ranch because it was so close to the Carmel Mission. They farmed potatoes and barley and had a milk dairy.

In 1888, Escolle and Santiago J. Duckworth filed a subdivision map with the County Recorder of Monterey County. By 1889, 200 lots had been sold. The name &quot;Carmel&quot; was earlier applied to another place on the north bank of the Carmel River east-southeast of the present-day Carmel. A post office called Carmel opened in 1889, closed in 1890, re-opened in 1893, moved in 1902, and closed for good in 1903. Abbie Jane Hunter, founder of the San Francisco-based Women&#x27;s Real Estate Investment Company, first used the name &quot;Carmel-by-the-Sea&quot; on a promotional postcard.

=== Modern era ===
In 1902, James Franklin Devendorf and Frank Hubbard Powers, on behalf of the Carmel Development Company, filed a subdivision map of the core village that became Carmel. They asked Michael J. Murphy to help build the houses. From 1902 to 1940, he built nearly 350 buildings in Carmel. The Carmel post office opened the same year. In 1899, Fritz Schweninger opened the first bakery on Ocean Avenue, called the Carmel Bakery. In 1910, the Carnegie Institution established the Coastal Laboratory, and a number of scientists moved to the area. Carmel incorporated in 1916. 

In 1905, the &quot;Carmel Arts and Crafts Club&quot; was formed to support and produce artistic works. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the village was inundated with musicians, writers, painters and other creatives. These new residents were offered home lots—ten dollars as a down payment, little or no interest, and whatever they could afford to pay on a monthly basis. In 1906, the &quot;San Francisco Call&quot; devoted a full page to the &quot;artists, writers and poets at Carmel-by-the-Sea&quot;. 

The Carmel Arts and Crafts Club held exhibitions, lectures, dances, and produced plays and recitals at numerous locations, including the Pine Inn Hotel, before purchasing a lot on Casanova Street, where they built a clubhouse in 1907. By 1914, the club had achieved national recognition.

In 1911, Carmel began a tradition of presenting plays by Shakespeare with a production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, directed by Garnet Holme of UC Berkeley and featuring future mayors Perry Newberry and Herbert Heron. &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; was again presented in 1940 at Heron&#x27;s inaugural Carmel Shakespeare Festival, and was repeated in 1942 and 1956.

In 1915, during the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, various items showcasing Carmel were featured in the Monterey County exhibit within the California Building. This exhibit included natural and industrial products of this part of the state. As part of Carmel&#x27;s involvement in the Exposition, the &quot;Junipero Serra or The Padres&quot; performance from the Forest Theater took place on July 30–31, 1915, within the Court of the Universe. This pageant, written and directed by Perry Newberry, was a tribute to Father Junipero Serra and featured prominent citizens of Carmel in its cast, such as Frederick R. Bechdolt and Grant Wallace. Around twenty-five thousand individuals attended these performances.

In 1925, Paul Aiken Flanders built the Flanders Mansion and used his home as a model for the Hatton Fields subdivision. The City of Carmel purchased the Flanders Mansion and adjoining in 1972, from the Flanders heirs for US$275,000 (). It has become part of the Mission Trail Nature Preserve.

In 1932, the city developed the Devendorf Park that occupies the block of Ocean Avenue and Junipero Street. The city park is Carmel&#x27;s central gathering place for outdoor events.

==Geography==

Carmel is located on the Monterey Peninsula, situated on the southern portion of Monterey Bay, on the Central Coast of California.

Carmel Pinnacles State Marine Reserve, Carmel Bay State Marine Conservation Area, Point Lobos State Marine Reserve and Point Lobos State Marine Conservation Area are marine protected areas in the waters around Carmel.

Carmel-by-the-Sea is situated in a moderate seismic risk zone, the principal threats being the San Andreas Fault, which is approximately thirty miles northeast, and the Palo Colorado Fault which traces offshore through the Pacific Ocean several miles away. More minor potentially active faults nearby are the Church Creek Fault and the San Francisquito Fault.

===Climate===

Carmel-by-the-Sea experiences a cool summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csb&quot;) normal in coastal areas of California. Summers are typically mild, with overcast mornings produced by marine layer clouds which can bring drizzles that typically give way to clear skies in the afternoon.

September and October (Indian summer) offer the most pleasant weather of the year, with an average high of . The wet season is from October to May.

Average annual rainfall in Carmel-by-the-Sea is per year, and the average temperature is .

=== City planning ===

Carmel has historically pursued a strategy of planned development to enhance its natural coastal beauty and to retain its character, which the city&#x27;s general plan describes as &quot;a village in a forest overlooking a white sand beach&quot;. Carmel-by-the-Sea was incorporated in 1916 and by 1925 it adopted a vision of its future as &quot;primarily, essentially and predominantly a residential community&quot; (Carmel-by-the-Sea City Council, 1929).

New buildings must be built around existing trees and new trees are required on lots that are deemed to have an inadequate number.

The one-square-mile village has no street lights or parking meters. In addition, the businesses, cottages and houses have no street numbers.

==Arts and culture==

=== Performing arts ===
In 1907, Carmel&#x27;s first cultural center and theatre, the Carmel Arts and Crafts Clubhouse, was built. Poets Austin and Sterling performed their &quot;private theatricals&quot; there. By 1913, The Arts and Crafts Club had begun organizing lessons for aspiring painters, actors, and craftsmen.
As theatrical activities grew, two competing indoor theatres were built between 1922 and 1924: the Arts &amp; Crafts Hall and the Theatre of the Golden Bough, designed and built by Edward G. Kuster and originally located on Ocean Avenue. In 1935, after a production of &quot;By Candlelight&quot;, the Golden Bough was destroyed by fire. Kuster, who had previously bought out the Arts and Crafts Theatre, moved his operation to the older facility and renamed it the Golden Bough Playhouse. In 1949, after remounting &quot;By Candlelight&quot;, the playhouse again burned to the ground. It was rebuilt and reopened in 1952.

In 1931, the Carmel Sunset School constructed a new auditorium, complete with Gothic-inspired architecture, with seating for 700. Often doubling as a performing arts venue for the community, the facility was bought by the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea in 1964, renaming the venue the Sunset Theatre. In 2003, following a $22 million renovation, the Sunset Center re-opened with the 66th annual Carmel Bach Festival.

In 1949, the first Forest Theater Guild was organized. For most of the 1960s, the outdoor theater lay unused and neglected, with the original Forest Theater Guild having ceased operations in 1961. In 1968, Marcia Hovick&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Experimental Theater leased the indoor theater and continued until 2010. In 1972, a new Forest Theater Guild was incorporated and continues to produce musicals, adding a film series in 1997.

=== Literature ===
In 1905, novelist Mary Austin moved to Carmel. She is best known for her tribute to the deserts of the American Southwest, &quot;The Land of Little Rain&quot;. Her play, &quot;Fire&quot;, which she also directed, had its world premiere at the Forest Theater in 1913. Austin has been credited as suggesting the idea for the outdoor stage.

===Visual arts===

In 1906, San Francisco photographer Arnold Genthe joined the Carmel arts colony, where he was able to pursue his pioneering work in color photography. His first attempts were taken in his garden, primarily portraits of his friends, including the leading Shakespearean actor and actress of the period, Edward Sothern and Julia Marlowe, who were costumed as Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. Of his new residence, he wrote, &quot;My first trials with this medium were made at Carmel where the cypresses and rocks of Point Lobos, the always varying sunsets and the intriguing shadows of the sand dunes offered a rich field for color experiments.&quot;

According to the Library of Congress, where over 18,000 of his negatives and prints are on file, Genthe &quot;became famous for his impressionistic portrayals of society women, artists, dancers, and theater personalities.&quot;
Photographer Edward Weston moved to Carmel in 1929 and shot the first of numerous nature photographs, many set at Point Lobos, on the south side of Carmel Bay. In 1936, Weston became the first photographer to receive a Guggenheim Fellowship for his work in experimental photography. In 1948, after the onset of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, he took his last photograph, an image of Point Lobos. Weston had traveled extensively with legendary photographer Ansel Adams, who moved to the Carmel Highlands in 1962, a few miles south of town.

== Government ==

Carmel is a general law city governed by a mayor and four city council members. The current mayor is Dave Potter. Elected councilmembers are Carrie Theis, Jeff Baron, Bobby Richards and Jan Reimers. Chip Rerig is the newest City Administrator.

The City of Carmel-by-the-Sea has established a &quot;sphere of influence&quot; that includes the communities of Carmel Woods, Hatton Fields, Mission Fields, Mission Tract, Carmel Point, and Carmel Hills. These neighborhoods are officially parts of unincorporated Monterey County, which provides most primary services, including law enforcement, street repairs, and public transit. Except for several shopping areas at the mouth of Carmel Valley, these satellite areas contain few, if any, businesses and serve primarily as bedroom communities to Carmel-by-the-Sea and the greater Monterey Peninsula.

===Mail===

In July 2024, Carmel-by-the-Sea City Council voted to establish street addresses for the first time in the city. There remains no home mail-delivery in Carmel-by-the-Sea (by contrast with adjacent, &quot;county-Carmel&quot; residential districts).

===Unusual laws===
Argyll Campbell served as city attorney of Carmel from 1920 to 1937. He was responsible for drawing up many of Carmel&#x27;s first zoning laws and ordinances. Campbell backed zoning ordinances that limited the business district and restricting the size of residential houses and lots. No sidewalks in the residential area, no streetlights, no commercial development on the beach, preservation of the native trees, one or two stories height limitation, no chain restaurants, and no billboards. These ordinances have helped preserve Carmel&#x27;s character as a village.

===County, state, and federal representation===

On the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, Carmel is represented by Supervisor Mary Adams.
In the California State Assembly, Carmel is in . In the California State Senate, Carmel in .

<text>Castroville is an unincorporated town and census-designated place (CDP) in Monterey County, California, United States. At the time of the 2020 census the population was 7,515, up from 6,481 in 2010. Castroville is known for its artichoke crop and for the annual Castroville Artichoke Festival, leading to its nickname as the &quot;Artichoke Center of the World&quot;.

The community&#x27;s origins lie in Rancho Bolsa Nueva y Moro Cojo, a Mexican-era rancho granted to the Castro family of Californio rancheros. Following the American Conquest of California, Juan Bautista Castro founded Castroville in 1863.

== History ==
=== Rancho Bolsa Nueva y Moro Cojo ===
Rancho Bolsa Nueva y Moro Cojo was a Mexican land grant given in 1844 by Governor Manuel Micheltorena to Maria Antonia Pico de Castro, Juan Bautista Castro&#x27;s mother. Rancho Bolsa Nueva y Moro Cojo is a combination of three land grants: Rancho Bolsa Nueva y Moro Cojo, given in 1844 by Governor Micheltorena to María Antonia Pico de Castro; Rancho Bolsa del Potrero y Moro Cojo, in 1822 by Governor Pablo Vicente de Solá to Joaquín de la Torre.; and the land between the other two, granted by Governor Juan Alvarado to Simeon Castro (Juan Bautista Castro&#x27;s father) in 1837.

Lake Merritt and the sloughs were popular for fishing and hunting. The area around Castroville was crisscrossed by a network of sloughs and swamps. In the 1840s, mapmaker Duflot de Mofras wrote, &quot;A few leagues before reaching the Pajaro River, an area measuring a few hundred meters where the ground trembles under the horses feet, although the earth is hard and covered by turf, is encountered. The land is probably formed by a solid crust superimposed on a vast miry base.&quot;

=== Castroville from 1850 ===
The town site was divided into blocks, with an alley running through each block. A lottery was established, and 100 lots were given away to any person who would clear land and build homes. In 1870 Manuel R. Merritt, editor of the &quot;Castroville Argus&quot;, announced, &quot;We will give alternate lots, on any part of the town site we still own… to any person who will build as practicable, a good comfortable dwelling house on his lot.&quot;

Juan Bautista Castro ran for county supervisor for the district. Castro, Merritt, Geil and others traveled to the oldest settlement of Sotoville in Salinas, where the Indians and Paisanos lived. They packed their belongings. Castro packed the tortilla cast iron pans, personal items and moved the people to Juan Pomber&#x27;s hotel for ninety days. They were registered and became ready to vote. They were not able to read in English, so the ballots were translated for them. Juan Bautista Castro won the office of supervisor of his district. Juan Pomber became roadmaster of the district. The county supplied money and low-income housing was built on the donated lots.

In 1875, Castroville had 900 residents. There were two hotels, five stores, stables, three saloons, a flour mill, two blacksmith shops, a newspaper, a post office, a telegraph office, a drugstore, a tailor shop, a shoemaker, two churches, a school house, a tin shop, and a brewery.

The Southern Pacific Railroad began extending its line south from Gilroy. Juan Bautista Castro had ambitions of Castroville becoming the new station freight depot. Castroville&#x27;s asking price for the land was high. Salinas offered the land for free, and was selected over Castroville. Castroville was still considered an important stop, serving as the &quot;point of juncture of the road from Monterey, and from Soledad to San Francisco.&quot; The first roundhouse was built in Castroville.

=== &quot;Castroville Argus&quot; newspaper ===
The &quot;Castroville Argus&quot; was established on July 17, 1869. The publishers were Juan Bautista Castro and Joseph R. Merritt. The editors were Manuel R. Merritt (nephew of Juan Bautista Castro) and S.F. Geil. The office was in the Hicks Building (hardware store, later turned into school house, La Scuola) on the corner of Merritt and Poole Streets. It was a weekly paper and a new edition was available every Saturday.

Joseph Merritt was born April 19, 1851. He was publisher for the &quot;Monterey Democrat&quot; and the &quot;Castroville Argus&quot;. In 1882, he was editor of the &quot;San Jose Mercury&quot;. In 1884, he was on the editorial staff of the &quot;San Jose Daily Herald&quot;. He married Annie Phillips in 1872. He died at the age of 36.

Manuel R. Merritt was born June 8, 1855. He was the editor of the &quot;Castroville Argus&quot;, &quot;Castroville Gazette&quot;, and the &quot;Monterey County Herald&quot;. In 1878 he was in the mercantile business, elected supervisor of Monterey County from the First District. Four times he was a delegate to the Democratic State Convention. He served as Secretary and as chairman for the Democratic County Committee. He became Postmaster and Justice of the Peace. Real estate and insurance business. He died at the age of 48 from an accidental gunshot wound.

=== Chinatown ===
&quot;In 1860 the Chinese contractors had established a presence here in Castroville. They were instrumental in clearing the slough, wetlands, and marshes especially in the northern section of the Rancho Bolsa Nueva y Moro Cojo. The land was ready to grow crops. In 1878 Manteufel moved the Chinese businesses that were on Merritt Street to the corner of McDougall and Speegle Street. In 1883 a fire destroyed the entire Chinatown. Chinatown was rebuilt and once again filled the sections of McDougall between Sanchez St. and Speegle St.&quot;

&quot;The new gold rush, applying to agriculture was termed, &quot;Sugar Beet Rush.&quot; With additional farms and more people, local businesses were successful. The Monterey County Assessor listed fifteen Chinese companies farming sugar beets in the area of Castroville. The sugar beets farms continued to multiply and grow towards Salinas. The Chinese population in Castroville continue to grow as well. In 1891 Sam Kee and Jim Lee purchased a lot in Castroville. The &quot;Quong Chung Company&quot; purchased another lot. &quot;This was the first time any Chinese had purchased property in the Monterey Bay Area.&quot;

In 1893 Salinas&#x27;s Chinatown was destroyed. Many Chinese contractors and business owners moved to Castroville. When Watsonville&#x27;s Chinatown burned down, the contractors also moved to Castroville. The California Alien Land Law of 1913 was passed. It prohibited aliens ineligible for citizenship from owning agricultural land or possessing long-term leases over it. It affected the Chinese, Indian, Japanese, and Korean immigrant farmers in California.

The new law was meant to discourage immigration. It created an inhospitable environment among contractors working here in the Monterey Bay Area. Letters from the editorial section had cartoons of anti-Chinese sentiment. A small group of business owners proposed an economic boycott of all businesses that employed Chinese directly or indirectly. Castroville&#x27;s farmers/landowners would not be intimidated. They would not be pressured to act un-American. The Chinese contractors made many contributions to the area, especially in the agriculture, railroad, and fishing industry. Without the Chinese contractors the agricultural industry would be in ruin. The Chinese contractors began to leave the Monterey Bay Area. Some moved to San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown.&quot;

=== First artichoke ===
It was the Spanish settlers who brought the artichoke to California. Some artichoke plants were in the gardens of European immigrants. California&#x27;s first artichoke fields grew south of San Francisco, near the town of Half Moon Bay, in the early 1920s. In 1922, Andrew Molera planted the first artichoke shoots in Castroville. Angelo Del Chiaro, Egidio Maracci, Daniel Pieri, and Amerigo Del Chiaro subsequently leased of land and grew artichokes.

In 1923, there were nine artichoke growers. Within four years, there were over 50 growers and of artichokes growing in Castroville and the Monterey Bay area. In 1924 Daniel Pieri, Amerigo Del Chiaro, Angelo Del Chiaro, Alfred Tottino, and James Bellone formed the California Artichoke and Vegetable Growers Corporation. In 1995, they renamed the company &quot;Ocean Mist Farms&quot;. &quot;Giant Artichoke&quot;, a large statue of an artichoke, was erected near a restaurant of the same name in 1963. It is the largest artichoke statue in the world.

=== First Artichoke Queen ===
Castroville&#x27;s first Artichoke Queen was Sally DeSante Hebert (1941–2004) crowned in 1961. She was born in Carmel and grew up in Castroville. She moved to Salinas, graduated from Salinas High School, and Hartnell College. She worked for Monterey County in the Planning Department, and was involved in the Junior League, Buena Vista Garden Club, American Cancer Society, and other civic-minded organizations.

=== Marilyn Monroe, Honorary Artichoke Queen ===
Stanley Seedman, owner of Carlyle&#x27;s Jewelers in Salinas, California, made arrangements for a model named Doreen Nash to model for a big promotional sale in Salinas in February 1948. Doreen Nash was not able to attend; her replacement was Marilyn Monroe.

Monroe spent a week in the Monterey Bay area, visiting and promoting her career. She replaced Doreen Nash at Carlyle&#x27;s Jewelry and signed autographs. Monroe was asked to draw the lucky ticket for a $250 diamond ring in the Vogue Theater. During her stay, Marilyn Monroe visited several men&#x27;s civic clubs including the Kiwanis Club. During the Kiwanis Club meeting, representatives from CalChoke (the California Artichoke Association) presented her with a sash as &quot;California Artichoke Queen&quot;. She posed with Edward Modena, Randy Barsotti, and Enrico Bellone, each holding artichokes.

The photographs of Marilyn wearing the sash and holding artichokes were used in advertisements and passed throughout the produce industry.

<text>Chualar (Spanish for &quot;Pigweed grove&quot;) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in the Salinas Valley of Monterey County, California, United States. Chualar is located southeast of Salinas, at an elevation of . The population was 1,185 at the 2020 census.

Chualar is located in northeastern Monterey County at . U.S. Route 101 runs along the southwest side of the community, leading northwest to Salinas and southeast to Soledad.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land.

In her &quot;Spanish and Indian Place Names of California&quot; (1914), Sanchez states that &quot;chualar&quot; was the indigenous word for an abundant and native goosefoot. This plant could possibly be &quot;Chenopodium californicum&quot;, the California goosefoot (also known as pigweed). In his &quot;1500 California Place Names&quot; (1998), William Bright writes that the name is Spanish for &quot;where the &quot;chual&quot; grows,&quot; &quot;chual&quot; being Mexican Spanish for pigweed or goosefoot, and derived ultimately from Nahuatl &quot;tzoalli&quot;.

==History==
The Chualar post office opened in 1871, closed in 1873, and re-opened in 1874.

At a railroad crossing about one mile south of town, a bus carrying Mexican migrant workers collided with a train in September 1963, killing 32 passengers and injuring 25. It was the most serious road accident in U.S. history, and helped spur the abolition of the bracero guest worker program. The portion of U.S. Route 101 where the accident occurred was named the &quot;Bracero Memorial Highway&quot; on the 50th anniversary of the accident in 2013. At that time two survivors of the crash were still alive.

On December 4, 2019, a levee near Chualar was partially breached at 2 pm. Highway 101 was shut down due to the broken levee. Children were stranded at the local school with a few teachers overnight. The levee break also caused a nursing home to be evacuated.

<text>Gonzales is a city in Monterey County, California, United States. Gonzales is located southeast of Salinas, at an elevation of . The population was 8,647 at the 2020 census, up from 8,187 at the 2010 census. Gonzales is a member of the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments. Gonzales won the Culture of Health Prize from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in 2019.

== History ==
Gonzales was founded by Dr. Mariano Gonzalez and his brother Alfredo Gonzales on land that was originally Rancho Rincon de la Puente del Monte. The rancho was given to their father, Teodoro Gonzalez, in 1836 while he was serving as &quot;alcalde&quot; of Monterey.

The brothers laid out the 50-block town on approximately in 1874 in a grid of northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast streets. In 1872, they granted a right-of-way through town to Southern Pacific Railroad, which subsequently built a depot for freight and passengers. The dominant commerce at the time was grain raising and cattle ranching. The Gonzalez brothers are also credited with constructing one of the first irrigation systems in the Salinas Valley. They built a dam and head gate on the nearby Salinas River and miles of canals throughout the area.

In the early 1900s, Gonzales became a predominantly Swiss dairy community when John B. Meyenberg brought his original milk processing procedures to the region. His Alpine Milk Company, later known as the Meyenberg Milk Products Company, opened its first plant in Gonzales in 1906. At one time, there were 7,000 cows within five miles of town being milked.

Prior to being nicknamed the &quot;Wine Capital of Monterey County&quot;, Gonzales was known as &quot;The Heart of the Salad Bowl&quot; (due to its central location in the agricultural valley). Before that it was nicknamed &quot;Little Switzerland&quot; (due to the similarities of the valley landscape to Switzerland as well as the predominantly Swiss community at the time).

Dairy farming gave way to orchards and row crops in the 1920s and prospered due to the rich soil and advancements in irrigation, machinery and transportation facilities. These improvements to agriculture technology turned the Salinas Valley into the nation&#x27;s premier agricultural center. Today, there is only one dairy farm left near town.

The first school house was built in 1874. The first church, the Gonzales Baptist Church, was built in 1884 and still holds weekly worship services today.

St. Theodore Catholic Church, named for Teodoro Gonzales, was built in 1883.

The town was officially incorporated January 10, 1947.

<text>Greenfield is a city in Monterey County, California, United States. Formerly Clarke Colony, it lies in the Salinas Valley, southeast of Salinas, at an elevation of . As of the 2020 census, the population was 18,937, up from 16,330 in the 2010 census. Its most well-known public event is the annual Harvest Festival. Greenfield is a member of the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments.

==History==
In 1902, the California Home Extension Association, founded by John S. Clark, purchased of land that had been part of Rancho Arroyo Seco, a Mexican land grant deeded to Joaquín de la Torre in 1840. The land was put up for sale at a public drawing in Los Angeles in 1905. Buyers could purchase an acre with water rights for about $37.50. A purchase of came with an added benefit — a lot in town.

In addition to the acreage, Clark got the water rights to the land. He formed the Clark Colony Water Company, which became the organization for water distribution and filled the city with water from the nearby Arroyo Seco. The organized water canal system and ideal growing conditions attracted people of Danish, Swiss and other nationalities from surrounding areas to settle in this new colony. Originally, the town was going to be named &quot;Clark City&quot;, but that was nixed by the U.S. Postal Service which informed the city there were too many &quot;Clark Cities&quot; in the state. Instead, the community named the town after one of its early founders and president of the Association, Edward Greenfield.

In the 1930, wells were dug to supplement water being drawn from the river, which created a year-round water supply.

The Clark Colony Water Company still holds 1916 Prior Rights guaranteeing delivery to its members a certain amount of water from the Arroyo Seco before any other agencies. The early canals are still viable and visible throughout the original land acreage.

Greenfield was recognized as a municipality by the state legislature and incorporated on January 7, 1947. Greenfield&#x27;s first mayor was Tom Rogers. Greenfield’s first directly elected mayor and first Hispanic/ Latino mayor was Elias de Leon, Jr. in 1986.

A northern campus for the Yanks Air Museum of Chino, California is under construction in Greenfield on a plot known as the Hanson Ranch, which was purchased in 1994 by museum founders Charles and Judith Nichols. In World War II the Hanson Ranch was the site of the Hanson Auxiliary Field. The new airstrip will use the original location and will see World War II aircraft landing there some 75 years later. This planned project will include a museum facility and the runway that will support both museum flight operations as well as serve the private aviation needs of both museum visitors and local aviators. The new museum facility is not intended to replace the existing facility in Chino, but to greatly expand the opportunities.

Greenfield is constructing the Tom Rogers Community Museum. Named after the first mayor of Greenfield, it will showcase the history of the city as far back as 1905.
First Night Monterey with the Arts Council of Monterey County has opened, in conjunction with the City of Greenfield, the Greenfield Cultural Arts Center located at 215 El Camino Real.

The first European land exploration of Alta California, Don Gaspar de Portolá&#x27;s Spanish expedition, camped on the Salinas River just south of today&#x27;s King City on September 26, 1769, having followed the route of today&#x27;s Jolon Road from the south. The land they camped on would later become part of King City.

The Dutton Hotel, Stagecoach Station, was located on Jolon Road in King City. What remains are ruins of an adobe inn that was established in 1849. The Dutton Hotel was a major stagecoach stop on El Camino Real in the late 1880s. The landmark was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 14, 1971.

King City was originally known as &quot;Kings City&quot; for its founder, Charles King. In 1884 Charles King acquired of the Mexican land grant Rancho San Lorenzo, originally given to Mariano and Feliciano Soberanes in the early 1840s during Mexican rule of California. King began growing of wheat. In an effort to get his crop to market, King allowed the Southern Pacific Railroad to lay tracks across King Ranch land. The terminus was a station known as King&#x27;s.

In 1886, the Southern Pacific Railroad completed service to King City station to serve the farms and ranches in the south Salinas Valley and to transport the goods to San Francisco and Los Angeles.

It was originally called &quot;Hog Town&quot; due to the passel of semi-wild hogs roaming the stubble fields. King wanted to name the town &quot;Vanderhurst&quot;, after local merchant William Vanderhurst, but was outvoted and it was named for him. The city became known as Kings&#x27;, then the City of King, and later simply King City.

The King City post office first opened in 1887. Edwards S. Brown, brother-in-law of C.H. King was appointed Postmaster. King City incorporated under the name &quot;City of King&quot; in 1911.

J. Ernst Steinbeck, father of the novelist John Steinbeck, claimed to have been the first permanent resident of King City. Steinbeck was certainly among the first settlers. He was the first agent for the Southern Pacific Milling Company, which built an early warehouse and flour mill alongside the railroad tracks running through town. The mill was built by R. M. Shackelford, an early California settler and businessman who owned sheep pasturage next to that of Charles King.

Agriculture has always played a role in King City history. Between 1910 and 1930, the city became famous for growing pink beans. King City Pinks were sold around the country, helped along by additional demand during World War I.

The Robert Stanton Auditorium, built in 1939 as a WPA Depression project, is an example of Art Moderne style, with elliptical rounded corners, Doric-style columns, an expansive curved stairway leading to recessed oak and glass double doors, and a bas-relief triptych by artist Jo Mora, above doors that depict notable multi-cultural scenes of historic importance. Mora&#x27;s art is incorporated into the building&#x27;s design both inside and out. In 1991, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Local newspapers include the Gannett-owned &quot;Salinas Californian&quot; and the town&#x27;s own weekly, &quot;The King City Rustler&quot;, which is owned by the Weeklys media group.

&quot;The Rustler&quot; was founded in 1901 by Fred Vivian, who reportedly went into a local barber shop, sold subscriptions to all the customers and then passed around a hat for them to suggest names for the newspaper. &quot;The Rustler&quot; was the one he drew out.

Vivian was later succeeded as publisher by his grandson Harry Casey, who was called home to King City in 1952 to take over management of the newspaper by his aunt Ruth Steglich after the death of her husband, then-publisher Bill Steglich. He served as co-publisher until Ruth Steglich&#x27;s death and publisher until declining health forced him to sell &quot;The Rustler&quot; and three other regional weeklies to News Media, Inc. in 1995. 

Casey died in 1998. Both he and Vivian are members of the California Newspaper Hall of Fame. Their sons Rich and Bill operated Casey Printing in King City until 2023.

Weeklys Media Group affiliate New SV Media purchased the Rustler in July 2019, returning it to California ownership after 24 years of ownership by the Illinois-based firm.

<text>Marina is a city in Monterey County, California, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 22,359, up from 19,718 in 2010. The city is located along the central coast of California, west of Salinas and northeast of Monterey. It is on California State Route 1 between Monterey and Santa Cruz and sits at an elevation of .

Marina was incorporated in 1975 and is the newest city in the Monterey area. It includes part of the California State University, Monterey Bay campus, the UC Santa Cruz UC MBEST center, and the Veterans Transition Center (VTC). In 2012, Marina was named one of the 100 Best Communities for Young People by America&#x27;s Promise Alliance. The Fort Ord Station Veterinary Hospital, built in 1941 to provide healthcare for U.S. Army horses and mules, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.

==History==
William Locke-Paddon founded the town on of land he bought for the purpose. The Marina post office opened in 1916. Marina incorporated in 1975. The city&#x27;s history is intertwined with that of Fort Ord. Fort Ord lands were used as an infantry training center since the Mexican–American War. Major growth took place in 1938 with the first joint Army and Navy maneuvers held in 1940.

Fort Ord was selected in 1991 for decommissioning, and the post formally closed after troop reassignment in 1994. In July 1994, the California State University, Monterey Bay, began its first academic year, and barracks were soon transformed into dorms.

As a result of base closure, some of the last undeveloped natural wildlands on the Monterey Peninsula are now overseen by the Bureau of Land Management, including of trails for the public to explore on foot, bike or horseback. In 2012, President Barack Obama designated of the closed base as a national monument managed by the BLM.

Cemex had a sand mining operation in the city along the Monterey Bay coastline that concerned environmentalists and scientists. The California Coastal Commission in March 2016 issued a Cease and Desist order asking for &quot;administration civil penalties&quot;, stating that &quot;the operation is narrowing beaches and impacting environmentally sensitive habitat.&quot; Cemex denied the allegations and continued to operate. A settlement was reached in 2017, and CEMEX ended mining in December 2020.

==Geography==
Unlike most other coastal cities in California, Marina&#x27;s coastline remains undeveloped and protects rare species of butterflies, buckwheat, and sea lettuce. The city plans to adapt to climate change and sea level rise, based on managed retreat, and has been described as an example for other coastal cities.

<doc id="107779" wikidata="Q2004754" url="?curid=107779" title="Moss Landing, California">
<text>Moss Landing, formerly Moss, is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Monterey County, California, United States. It is located north-northeast of Monterey, at an elevation of . It is on the shore of Monterey Bay, at the mouth of Elkhorn Slough and at the head of the submarine Monterey Canyon.

==History==
The earliest residents of the Moss Landing/Elkhorn Slough area were the Ohlone people. Evidence from archaeological digs show that they may have lived here as long ago as 4,000 years. The Spanish forced the Ohlone into the mission system in the 1700s from which few survived. &quot;A total of 81,000 Indians were baptized and 60,000 deaths were recorded.&quot; After the mission system was secularized, the Spanish government granted vast ranchos to soldiers and others with connections, including the Rancho Bolsa Nueva y Moro Cojo. This grant extended from Moss Landing to present-day Prunedale and south to Castroville.

They farmed the land and ran cattle over the nearby hills. Americans arrived in the mid-1800s and farmers turned the area into cropland.

In the early 1860s Charles Moss, a Texas ship captain, established with the help of a partner a landing and wharf to handle the emerging grain trade in the Salinas Valley.

William B. Post earned a reputation as a skilled bear and deer hunter in the Big Sur region, and he traded in hides and buckskin. This work drew him north to Moss Landing. Post opened one of the first grain warehouses along the coast at Moss Landing. Flat bottom boats brought grain from all over the Salinas Valley to Elkhorn Slough and unloaded at Post&#x27;s warehouse. W.B. became an agent for the steamship company of Goodall, Nelson and Perkins. The success of the shipping point stimulated the growth of Castroville, one of Monterey County&#x27;s first municipalities, which served to support Moss Landing commerce.

The location was initially named &quot;Moss&quot;, after Charles Moss. The Moss post office opened in 1895 and in 1917 changed its name to &quot;Moss Landing&quot;. It became a busy whaling and fishing port and a location for fish processing plants and canneries. The Moss Landing Harbor District, established in the 1940s, dredged channels and built piers. The Moss Landing Power Plant opened in 1950. The California State University system founded Moss Landing Marine Laboratories in 1966 (it was rebuilt nearby after the Loma Prieta Earthquake destroyed the facility in 1989), and in the mid-1990s the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute was moved to Moss Landing from Pacific Grove. In the 1980s, then-Monterey County Supervisor Marc Del Piero secured millions of dollars in federal grants to cure historic and chronic water pollution issues and sanitary sewers were installed.

<text>Pacific Grove is a city situated on the southern edge of Monterey Bay, on the Central Coast of California. Located in Monterey County, the city had a population of 5,090 at the 2020 census. Pacific Grove is a popular tourist destination on the Central Coast, hosting notable attractions the Monarch Grove Sanctuary, Asilomar Conference Center, the Pacific Grove Marine Gardens, and Point Pinos Lighthouse, among others.

The region was historically inhabited by the Rumsen tribe of Ohlone people. During the Mexican era, the area was granted by Governor José Figueroa to local merchant José Abrego as part of Rancho Punta de Piños, in 1833. Following the Mexican-American War and the U.S. conquest of California, the area developed into a notable fishing village. By 1875, the Pacific Improvement Company owned most of the area and founded the modern settlement of Pacific Grove as a Methodist retreat. By the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, Pacific Grove had come to host a notable art colony, along with the other communities of the Monterey Peninsula.

==History==

The first people to inhabit Pacific Grove were members of the Ohlone Rumsen tribe who lived between Big Sur and San Francisco since the 6th century CE. Grinding stones from this tribe still exist in Pacific Grove. The area later became part of the Mexican land grant Rancho Punta de Pinos.

The second group of people to come to Pacific Grove were Chinese immigrants as early as 1853. They established a successful fishing village at Point Alones, an area between Lover&#x27;s Point and the western edge of Monterey. The Chinese were the first to recognize the potential for commercial fishing in the Monterey Bay. Others quickly saw the benefit, however, and eventually pushed the Chinese from their daytime fishing grounds. Being resourceful, they began fishing for squid in the night, thus beginning California&#x27;s squid fishery – now one of California&#x27;s largest fisheries.’
By 1859 the property this village sat on belonged to David Jacks (businessman) who owned almost the entire area of the Monterey Peninsula. Jacks sold the property to The Pacific Improvement Company which attempted removal of the Chinese American community in 1905 due to several development interests including Stanford University on which Hopkin&#x27;s Marine Station now sits. In 1906 there was a fire at the village and during the battle to save the village a firehose was suspiciously cut thereby causing it to completely burn down. The families, without a village to call their own, soon dispersed throughout the region.’. The first Chinese American born at the village did receive property restitution elsewhere. The loss is memorialized every year in a Walk of Remembrance in mid-May.

It is notable that not only was the Point Alones fishing village the oldest and longest running fishing village on the West Coast, but also had just as many women as men living there. Even through the years of the national Chinese Exclusion Act there were many positive interactions with the summer Methodist Camp, later to be the town of Pacific Grove. The Methodist women taught English at the village and no doubt fish would have been purchased. Also, a lighted boat parade originally put on by the Chinese fishermen at the closing of the Methodist summer camp was a tradition which continued until a few years ago.

The city of Pacific Grove originated as a Methodist Christian seaside resort. In 1874, Reverend J.W. Ross, a Methodist minister and his wife, visited the area and decided it would be an ideal location for a proposed Methodist Retreat. The pine, oak and cypress trees, along with many varieties of wild plants and flowers, made Pacific Grove an attractive place for camping. On June 1, 1875, the Pacific Grove Retreat Association was formed in San Francisco to administer the Christian Seaside Resort in Pacific Grove. The Pacific Improvement Company (which later became Del Monte Properties) and David Jacks provided the land for the Retreat area. This Retreat Area, as surveyed at that time by St. John Cox, covers the area from the Bay up to Lighthouse Avenue and from First Street to Pacific Avenue.

In November 1879, after the summer campers returned home, Robert Louis Stevenson wandered into the deserted campgrounds: &quot;I have never been in any place so dreamlike. Indeed, it was not so much like a deserted town as like a scene upon the stage by daylight, and with no one on the boards.&quot;

The Pacific Grove post office opened in 1886, closed later that year, and was reopened in 1887. Pacific Grove incorporated in 1889.

The El Carmelo Hotel was Pacific Grove&#x27;s first hotel, opening to guests on May 20, 1887. It was sometimes called the sister of Monterey&#x27;s Hotel Del Monte. It was located on Lighthouse Avenue between Fountain and Grand avenues and owned by the Pacific Improvement Company (PIC). In 1907, the name changed to the Pacific Grove Hotel. In 1917, the PIC decided to dismantle it and use the wood in the reconstruction of The Lodge at Pebble Beach that had burned down on December 17, 1917. The empty block was sold to W. R. Holman in 1919 to open the Holman Department Store.

Thomas Albert Work built several of the buildings in Pacific Grove, including the three-story Del Mar hotel in 1895, at the corner of Sixteenth, and in 1904 he built a commercial block along Lighthouse Avenue to house local businesses, including the two-story Romanesque-style Bank of Pacific Grove.

Pacific Grove, like Carmel-by-the-Sea and Monterey, became an artists&#x27; haven in the 1890s and subsequent period. Artists of the &quot;En plein air &quot;school in both Europe and the United States were seeking an outdoor venue with natural beauty, and Pacific Grove became a magnet for this movement. William Adam was an English painter who first moved to Monterey and then decided on Pacific Grove for his home in 1906. At about the same time, Eugen Neuhaus, a German painter, arrived in Pacific Grove with his new bride. Charles B. Judson was an artist of aristocratic lineage who painted in Pacific Grove over a long time beginning in 1907; Judson&#x27;s murals decorate the halls of the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.

The Asilomar Conference Grounds are located at the western edge of Pacific Grove. Asilomar opened in 1913 as a YWCA summer retreat; it now belongs to the California State Park System. Thirteen buildings on these grounds were designed by architect Julia Morgan, who also designed Hearst Castle.

Taken together, the construction of Holman&#x27;s Department Store, the Grove Theater, and the Forest Hill Hotel embodied the vibrant optimism of the 1920s. During this era, Pacific Grove witnessed a growing accessibility to automobile tourists and a rising population of year-round residents. Additionally, two of these structures exemplify significant architectural trends of the period, as both the Grove Theater and Forest Hill Hotel feature elements influenced by Spanish-style design. This stylistic shift was echoed in other commercial buildings as well, including the transformation of the Hotel Del Mar. Around the same period, it underwent remodeling to adopt the Mediterranean Revival style, marked by stucco cladding and distinctive red tile embellishments.

For a number of years, John Steinbeck lived in a cottage in Pacific Grove owned by his father, Ernest, who was Monterey County treasurer. The cottage still stands on a quiet side street at 147 11th Street, without any plaque or special sign, virtually overlooked by most Steinbeck fans. Another Steinbeck-related house is at 222 Central Avenue, which was his grandmother&#x27;s house. A golden statue of Steinbeck in the front yard stood for years before it was removed. In Steinbeck&#x27;s book &quot;Sweet Thursday&quot;, a chapter is dedicated to describing a (probably fictional) rivalry that arose among the town&#x27;s residents over the game of roque.

Local traditions include a Butterfly Parade held in early October to celebrate the return of the monarch butterfly to its wintering habitat. Mid-April, a Good Old Days festival is held downtown, which includes rides, crafts booths, food, entertainment, and a parade. On the last Saturday of July there is a pet parade. Candy Cane Lane is a neighborhood of Morse Dr and Platt Park that is decorated for Christmas each December with an abundance of lights and decorations. Candy Cane Lane has been a local tradition for more than 60 years.

Hopkins Marine Station maintains a campus next to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. It was founded in 1892, originally at the site of Lover&#x27;s Point, making it the oldest marine laboratory on the US Pacific Coast, and the third-oldest in the US. Created after the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. It was originally named the Hopkins Seaside Laboratory, and was located on what is now Lovers Point. It was relocated to its current site at Point Alones.

In the 1980s, Pacific Grove was the site of the pioneering microcomputer software company Digital Research. Originally located in Gary Kildall&#x27;s house on the corner of Lighthouse and Willow, it later moved to offices on Central Avenue.

On October 12, 1997, John Denver died when he crashed into the Pacific Ocean off Pacific Grove in his personal plane.

Pacific Grove was the last dry town in California. Due to the city&#x27;s religious and gated history, alcohol was not served to the public until July 4, 1969, at the grand opening of the Pacific Grove Art Center by ElMarie Dyke, its founder. This caused much controversy because the law was not to take effect until November of that year. Ironically, ElMarie was also a great proponent for keeping the town dry. To this day, Pacific Grove has very strict laws regarding the service of alcohol and has no stand-alone bars.

At the November 6, 2018, general municipal election, Pacific Grove voters approved Measure M, which prohibits short-term vacation rentals in residential districts outside the Coastal Zone.

== Geography and ecology ==

Pacific Grove contains several habitat types, including marine, littoral, pine forest, and mixed-oak woodland. The famed breeding habitat for the monarch butterfly, the Monarch Grove Sanctuary, is situated in the northwest part of town imbedded in residential neighborhoods in mixed oak forests. These monarchs migrate to reach Pacific Grove after their summer in the Rocky Mountains, often soaring as high as .

The black-and-orange monarch butterflies spend much of the fall and winter in Monterey pine and eucalyptus trees, roughly from the autumnal equinox through the spring (or vernal) equinox. Most butterflies are protected in the city&#x27;s Butterfly Sanctuary. City Ordinance No. 352 makes killing or threatening a butterfly a misdemeanor, punishable by a $1,000 fine.

Pacific Grove Marine Gardens State Marine Conservation Area, Lovers Point State Marine Reserve, Edward F. Ricketts State Marine Conservation Area and Asilomar State Marine Reserve are marine protected areas in the waters around Pacific Grove. Like underwater parks, these marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems. Monterey Bay is a marine protected sanctuary.

The principal noise source in Pacific Grove is State Route 68. There are approximately 800 residents exposed to sound levels of 60 CNEL or above, making Pacific Grove noticeably quieter than its neighbor Monterey, which has more tourist traffic and more through traffic.

The town sits between its two well known neighbors, Pebble Beach and Monterey. Carmel-by-the-Sea is the next city, south, and the community of Big Sur is south. Pacific Grove is a favorite vacation getaway for San Francisco Bay Area residents, as it is located two hours south of San Francisco.

The town does not allow development on the waterside of the ocean-front street, so that the beaches and scenic points are unobstructed.

Pacific Grove is on the Pacific Ocean coast between Monterey and Pebble Beach, about south of Santa Cruz and about south of San Francisco. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , and about are land and (28.28%) are covered by water. Asilomar, Lovers Point, and the intervening coastline afford surfing, which is challenging due to near-shore rocks, albeit waves are typically moderate in height.

===Climate===

Owing to its coastal location, Pacific Grove&#x27;s climate is mild and fairly consistent throughout the year, essentially the same as in neighboring Monterey, with most of the rain falling from November through April. Extreme temperatures are rare, and fog is common, especially in the late night and early morning, all year.

This region experiences warm and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 °F. According to the Köppen climate classification, Pacific Grove has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps.

==Government==

Pacific Grove is governed by a city council consisting of a mayor and six councilmembers, all elected at-large. As of the November 2022 election, the mayor is Bill Peake, and the six councilmembers are: Joe Amelio, Debby Beck, Luke Coletti, Lori McDonnell, Chaps Poduri, and Nick Smith.

At the county level, Pacific Grove is represented on the Monterey County Board of Supervisors by Mary Adams.

In the California State Assembly, Pacific Grove is represented by as part of the 29th Assembly district. In the California State Senate, it is represented by as part of the 17th Senate district.

<text>Prunedale is a unincorporated community in Monterey County, California, United States. It is located north of Salinas at an elevation of . The population was 18,885 as of the 2020 census, up from 17,560 in 2010. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Prunedale as a census-designated place (CDP). Plum trees were grown in Prunedale in the early days of its founding, but the trees died soon after due to poor irrigation and fertilizer.

== History ==
One of the area&#x27;s earliest settlers was Charles Langley, a Watsonville banker, who also operated the Prunedale post office, which opened in 1894, closed in 1908, and re-opened in 1953. Langley helped establish the Watsonville post office mail service in Prunedale. Langley Canyon Road in Prunedale is named after the Langley family. It was around the time of Prunedale&#x27;s founding that the plum orchard failed due to a lack of irrigation and fertilizer, yet the name Prunedale was retained. The unincorporated area maintains a rural feel in most areas.

A major development in the area&#x27;s history occurred when U.S. Route 101 was rerouted through Prunedale between 1931 and 1932. U.S. Highway 101 had previously run directly from Salinas to San Juan Bautista. That old route is now known as San Juan Grade Road. In 1946, Highway 101 was widened to four lanes. As Prunedale has grown, increased traffic congestion made Route 101 through Prunedale a Traffic Safety Corridor and a double traffic fine zone in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with reduced speed limits to 55 miles per hour. Detailed plans to build a 101 bypass of Prunedale did not develop. After Caltrans purchased the land for the bypass, it was resolved to improve the highway through Prunedale by adding a San Miguel Canyon overpass, improving the Highway 101 and Highway 156 interchange, making more turn and merge lanes, and making several other improvements on the roadway. These improvements were completed in the early 2000s. In the last few years, with a decline in traffic fatalities, the speed limit was increased to 60 miles per hour via state traffic formulas.

One of the original businesses to inhabit Prunedale was Glenn&#x27;s. In the 1970s, the Prunedale Shopping Center was built. The Prunedale Senior Citizens&#x27; Center was built in 1989 with grant funds secured by then Monterey County Supervisor Marc Del Piero. Meals for seniors and public assistance programs, including a bi-weekly food bank giveaway, continue to be operated from that facility.

<text>Salinas (; Spanish for &quot;Salt Flats&quot;) is a city in the U.S. state of California and the seat of government of Monterey County. With a population of 163,542 in the 2020 Census, Salinas is the most populous city in Monterey County. Salinas is an urban area located along the eastern limits of the Monterey Bay Area, lying just south of the San Francisco Bay Area and southeast of the mouth of the Salinas River. The city is located at the mouth of the Salinas Valley, about from the Pacific Ocean, and it has a climate more influenced by the ocean than the interior.

Salinas serves as the main business, governmental, and industrial center of the region. The marine climate is ideal for the floral industry, grape vineyards, and vegetable growers. Salinas is known as the &quot;Salad Bowl of the World&quot; for its large, vibrant agriculture industry.

It was the hometown of writer and Nobel laureate John Steinbeck (1902–68), who set many of his stories in the Salinas Valley and Monterey. Salinas has a high Hispanic proportion, which at 79.6%, is the highest proportion of Hispanic Americans out of any city in California, and 8th largest overall in the nation. The city also has a sizable Asian-American population, with a large and historic Filipino population. The city once also had the 2nd biggest Chinatown in the nation behind only San Francisco.

==History==
The land that Salinas sits on is thought to have been settled by Native Americans known as the Esselen prior to 200 AD. Between 200 and 500 AD, they were displaced by the Rumsen group of Ohlone speaking people. The Rumsen-Ohlone remained as the inhabitants of the area for approximately another 1,200 years, and in the 1700s, were the group of native inhabitants contacted and recorded by the first Spanish explorers of the Salinas area.

Upon the arrival of the Spanish, large Spanish land grants were initially issued for the Catholic Missions and also as bonuses to soldiers. Later on after Mexican independence, smaller land grants continued to be issued for ranchos where mostly cattle were grazed. One of the many land grants was the Rancho Las Salinas land grant, part of which included the area of modern-day Salinas. As a result of the many new cattle ranches, a thriving trade eventually developed in cattle hide shipments, shipping primarily out of the Port of Monterey.

Before the transition to American administration, Monterey had been the capital of California. For a short while after the transition, California was ruled by martial law. On September 9, 1850, California was admitted to the Union and became a State, celebrated as California Admission Day.

In the 1850s a junction of two main stage coach routes was located east of Monterey and along the big bend of what is locally referred to as the Alisal Slough. In 1854, six years after becoming a part of the United States, a group of American settlers living in the vicinity of this route-junction opened a post office at the junction, naming their town &quot;Salinas,&quot; apparently a reference to the original &quot;Rancho Las Salinas&quot; name for the area, which in turn was named in Spanish for the salt marshes of the area around the central Salinas slough, which was drained. Soon thereafter, in 1856, a traveler&#x27;s inn called the Halfway House was opened at that junction in Salinas. (The nearby Salinas River, was apparently only later named by an American cartographer, after the nearest town of Salinas in 1858. Previously that river had gone by the name: &quot;Rio de Monterey.&quot;). The streets of Salinas were laid out in 1867, and the town was incorporated in 1874.

The conversion of grazing land to crops and the coming of the rail road in 1868 to transport goods and people was a major turning point in the history and economic advancement of Salinas. Dry farming of wheat, barley, and other grains as well as potatoes and mustard seed was common in the 1800s. Chinese labor drained thousands of acres of swampland to become productive farmland, and as much early farm labor was done by Chinese immigrants, Salinas boasted the second largest Chinatown in the state, slightly smaller than San Francisco. Irrigation changed farming in Salinas to mainly row crops of root vegetables, grapes and sugar beets. Many major vegetable producers placed their headquarters in Salinas. Driven by the profitable agricultural industry, Salinas had the highest per capita income of any city in the United States in 1924.


During World War II, the Salinas Rodeo Grounds was one of the locations used as a temporary detention camp for citizens and immigrant residents of Japanese ancestry, before they were relocated to more permanent and remote facilities. One of seventeen such sites overseen by the Wartime Civilian Control Administration, the Salinas Assembly Center was built after President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, authorizing the removal and confinement of Japanese Americans living on the West Coast. The camp opened on April 27, 1942, and held a total of 3,608 people before closing two months later on July 4. Of the 300 Japanese-American families in Salinas before the war, only 25 returned following internment.

Following World War II major urban and suburban development converted much farmland to city. The city experienced two particularly strong growth spurts in the 1950s and 1960s, and again in the 1990s and early 2000s. Aerial photographic interpretation indicate such major conversion of cropland to urban uses over the time period 1956 to 1968, while the city annexed the adjacent communities of Alisal and Santa Rita during this time. The Harden Ranch, Creekbridge and Williams Ranch neighborhoods constituting much of the city&#x27;s North-East were built almost exclusively between 1990 and 2004.

Salinas was also the birthplace of writer and Nobel Prize laureate John Steinbeck. The historic downtown, known as &quot;Oldtown Salinas&quot;, features much fine Victorian architecture, and is home to the National Steinbeck Center, the Steinbeck House and the John Steinbeck Library.

Major development took place in the 1990s, with the construction of Creekbridge, Williams Ranch, and Harden Ranch.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , 99.84% of it land and 0.16% of it water.

Prior to mass agricultural and urban development, much of the city consisted of rolling hills bisected by wooded creeks and interspersed with marsh land. Today, the city is located mostly on leveled ground, with some rolling hills and wooded gulches with creeks remaining in the north-eastern Creekbridge and Williams Ranch neighborhoods, as well as the Laurel Heights section of East Salinas. The natural ecosystems accompanying the area&#x27;s topography and environment have been recreated in Natividad Creek Park and adjacent Upper Carr Lake.

The city rests about above sea level, and it is located roughly eight miles from the Pacific Ocean. The Gabilan and Santa Lucia mountain ranges border the Salinas Valley to the east and to the west, respectively. Both mountain ranges and the Salinas Valley run approximately south-east from Salinas towards King City.

The Salinas River runs the length of the Salinas Valley and empties into the Pacific Ocean at the center of the Monterey Bay. During the summer months the river flows partially underground and it is this extensive underground aquifer that allows for irrigation of cropland in an area without much annual rainfall.

===Climate===

Salinas has cool and moderate temperatures, due to the &quot;natural air conditioner&quot; that conveys ocean air and fog from the Monterey Bay to Salinas, while towns to the north and south of Salinas experience hotter summers, as mountains block the ocean air. Thus, Salinas weather is closer to that of the Central Coast of California, rather than that of inland valleys, and thus has a mild Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;) with typical daily highs ranging from in December to in September. The record highest temperature was on September 2, 2017. The record lowest temperature was on January 12, 1963, and January 13, 2007. Annually, there are an average of 5.8 days with + highs, and an average of 7.1 days with lows reaching the freezing mark or lower.

Between 1958 and 2018, the coldest measured daytime high in Salinas was on December 21–22, 1990. The warmest night during the station&#x27;s operation was on September 2, 2017.

In 2015 Salinas was in the top ten American cities for cleanest air quality, 

The difference between ocean and air temperature also tends to create heavy morning fog during the summer months, known as the marine layer, driven by an onshore wind created by the local high pressure sunny portions of the Salinas Valley, which extend north and south from Salinas and the Bay.

The average annual rainfall for the city is approximately . The wettest &quot;rain year&quot; since records at the present station began in 1959 was from July 1997 to June 1998 with of precipitation, and the driest from July 1971 to June 1972 with . The most precipitation in one month was in February 1998. The record maximum 24-hour precipitation was on January 23, 2000.

===Crime===
Salinas has a significant, but declining problem with organized street gangs, such as Nortenos, Surenos, and Crips and the associated violent crime. According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, the city&#x27;s overall violent crime and homicide rates are above those for California and the nation overall. However, the violent crime rate in Salinas has declined by almost 75 percent since 2015. Gang activity and violent crime are focused in Central and East Salinas and exacerbated by the city&#x27;s comparatively low tax base and consequently limited policing resources. A hypothesis to explain the city&#x27;s particularly intense problem with gang related violent crime cites the city&#x27;s proximity to Salinas Valley State Prison. The prison was an early launch pad for street operations of the notorious prison gang, &quot;Nuestra Familia&quot;. This in turn, is seen as having spawned a legacy of multi-generational gang membership among the poorer and less educated residents of East Salinas.

Today, Soledad is a notable tourist destination, owing to the heavily restored mission, its proximity to Pinnacles National Park, and its numerous vineyards, as part of the Monterey wine region.

==History==

The Chalon tribe of the Ohlone nation of indigenous Californians have inhabited the area around Soledad for thousands of years. The Paraíso Hot Springs, west of Soledad, had long been used by the Chalon.

Soledad&#x27;s history as a settlement began in 1791, when the Spanish founded Mission Nuestra Señora de la Soledad, under the leadership of Padre Fermín de Lasuén. Alongside the Spanish and the Chalon, the Esselen and Yokuts people eventually came to reside in Soledad as well. However, unlike many other missions in California, Soledad did not initially develop into a town outside of the mission.

Noted artist Esteban Munrás came to the area in the 1820s, along with his wife Catalina Munrás. He was granted Rancho San Vicente in 1835 by Governor José Castro, although he and his family resided in Monterey until his death in 1850. On his deathbed, Munrás told his dying wishes to his wife Catalina: that she should not sell Rancho San Vicente, but instead hold on to it and develop a town there when the right time came.

Catalina Munrás began to subdivide the rancho and develop a town in the 1860s, and donated land for the construction of a school, a church, and a cemetery. She later granted the right-of-way to the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1872, which established a station in Soledad, allowing the town to emerge as an agricultural center.

Los Coches Adobe, built in the 1840s, became a popular stopover for people traveling on Southern Pacific trains between Los Angeles and San Francisco.

The Soledad post office opened in 1869. The Township of Soledad was created on February 6, 1876, by the Board of Supervisors of Monterey County, upgrading the settlement to an official town. In 1921, Soledad incorporated as a city.

In 1898 Fort Romie was founded just west of Soledad, but is today part of the community of Soledad. In the early 1900s, the Paraíso Hot Springs became a popular resort for travelers on Southern Pacific trains.

Soledad is used as a backdrop in John Steinbeck&#x27;s 1937 novel &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, a novella about the friendship of two men who find work on a farm in the Salinas Valley.

<text>Calistoga (Wappo: &quot;Nilektsonoma&quot;) is a city in Napa County, California, United States. Located in the North Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area, the city had a population of 5,228 as of the 2020 census.

Calistoga was founded in 1868 when the California Pacific Railroad was built, establishing the town as a tourist destination for its Calistoga Hot Springs. Today, Calistoga continues as a popular tourist destination in Wine Country, owing to its vineyards and historic landmarks.

==History==
The Upper Napa Valley was once the home of a significant population of Indigenous People, called the Wappo, during the Spanish colonial era of the late 18th century. With abundant oak trees providing acorns as a food staple and the natural hot springs as a healing ground Calistoga (Wappo: &quot;Nilektsonoma&quot;, meaning &quot;Chicken Hawk Place&quot;) was the site of several villages. Following Mexican Independence, mission properties were secularized and disposed of by the Mexican government with much of the Napa Valley being partitioned into large ranchos in the 1830s and 1840s. The first Anglo settlers began arriving in the 1840s, with several taking up lands in the Calistoga area.

Samuel Brannan was the leader of a Mormon settlement expedition on the ship &quot;Brooklyn&quot; landing in Yerba Buena (San Francisco) in 1846. He published San Francisco&#x27;s first English-language newspaper, the &quot;California Star&quot;. Following the discovery of gold in Coloma, Brannan became California&#x27;s first millionaire. Fascinated by Calistoga&#x27;s natural hot springs, Brannan purchased more than with the intent to develop a spa reminiscent of Saratoga Springs in New York.

The name of &quot;Calistoga&quot; was given to the place in the fall of 1867, by Mr. Brannan, who has been reported and quoted as saying that the name came from a slip of the tongue that transformed &quot;Saratoga of California&quot; into &quot;Calistoga of Sarafornia&quot;. The place had already been previously called &quot;Hot Springs&quot; by the few Americans, and &quot;Agua Caliente&quot; by the Spaniards and Indians.

Brannan&#x27;s Hot Springs Resort surrounding Mt. Lincoln with the Spa/Hotel located at what is now Indian Springs Resort and Brannan Cottage Inn, opened to California&#x27;s rich and famous in 1862. The Napa Valley Railroad Company&#x27;s track was completed to Calistoga in 1868, providing an easier connection for ferry passengers traveling from San Francisco, as well as transforming Calistoga into a transportation hub for the upper Napa Valley and a gateway to Lake and Sonoma Counties. 
Calistoga&#x27;s economy was based on mining (silver and mercury) agriculture (grapes, prunes and walnuts) and tourism (the hot springs). One of the early visitors was Robert Louis Stevenson, who wrote the &quot;Silverado Squatters&quot; while honeymooning with his wife Fanny Vandegrift at a cabin near Silverado Mine on Mount Saint Helena.

In 1920, Giuseppe Musante, a soda fountain and candy store owner in Calistoga, was drilling for a cold water well at the Railway Exchange when he tapped into a hot water source. In 1924 he set up a bottling line and began selling Calistoga Sparkling Mineral Water. The company became a major player in the bottled water business after Elwood Sprenger bought the small bottling plant in 1970 known today as Calistoga Water Company.

Calistoga was named a Distinctive Destination by the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 2001.

In 2017, the Tubbs Fire, which killed at least 19 people, started off of Highway 128 and Bennett Lane in Calistoga. The fire led to the evacuation of almost the entire population of Calistoga. The 2017 Tubbs Fire took exactly the same path as the 1964 Hanley Fire. In 2020, the Glass Fire forced an evacuation of the city for the second time in four years.

<text>Napa is the largest city and county seat of Napa County and a principal city of Wine Country in Northern California, United States. Located in the North Bay region of the Bay Area, the city had a population of 77,480 as of the end of 2021. Napa is a major tourist destination in California, known for its wineries, restaurants, and arts culture.

== History ==
The origin of the word &quot;Napa&quot; is disputed.

The word &quot;napa&quot; is of Native American derivation and has been variously translated as &quot;grizzly bear&quot;, &quot;house&quot;, &quot;motherland&quot; or &quot;fish&quot;. Of the many explanations of the name&#x27;s origin, the most plausible seems to be that it is derived from the Patwin word &quot;napo&quot;, meaning &quot;house&quot;.

Further adding confusion, Napa was originally spelled with two Ps: Nappa. There are maps and deeds dating back to the mid-1850s bearing this spelling. Shortly thereafter, the present spelling was adopted; the reasons for this are unclear.

===Mexican era===
At the time of the first recorded exploration into Napa Valley in 1823, the majority of the inhabitants consisted of Native Americans. Padre José Altimira, founder of Mission San Francisco Solano in Sonoma, led the expedition. Spanish priests converted some natives; the rest were attacked and dispersed by Mexican soldiers.

The first American settlers began arriving in the area in the 1830s.

===Post-Conquest era===

Prior to the American Conquest of California, Napa Valley was in California&#x27;s District of Sonoma. At the time, its boundaries also included Lake County to the north. By this time, the indigenous people were either working as field laborers or living in small bands in the hills surrounding the valley. Tensions between the white settlers and Native Americans broke into war in 1850, resulting in soldiers hunting down and massacring all the natives they could find, driving the remainder north toward Clear Lake. By 1870, the Native American population consisted of only a few laborers and servants working for the white settlers.

The City of Napa was founded by Nathan Coombs in 1847. General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo had paid to survey for a township downriver at Soscol Landing, where riverboats could turn around prior to Napa&#x27;s founding. Instead, the Napa town site was surveyed on property Coombs had received from Nicolas Higuera, original holder of the Rancho Entre Napa, a Mexican land grant. The first record of a ship navigating the river was the &quot;Susana&quot; in 1842, though by 1850 the &quot;Dolphin&quot; became the first passenger steamship to navigate the Napa River in order to open another path of commerce.

In the mid-1850s, Napa&#x27;s Main Street rivaled that of many larger cities, with as many as 100 saddle horses tied to the fences on an average afternoon. John Patchett opened the first commercial winery in the county in 1859. The &quot;Napa Valley Register&quot;, founded by J.I. Horrell and L. Hoxie Strong, made its debut on August 10, 1863, with weekly publications until becoming a daily newspaper in 1872.

The California Gold Rush of the late 1850s expanded Napa City. A tent city was erected along Main Street. Many cattle ranches were maintained, and the lumber industry had greatly expanded. Sawmills in the valley were in operation cutting up timber that was hauled by team to Napa and then shipped out on the river to Benicia and San Francisco.

In 1858, the great silver rush began in Napa Valley, and miners eagerly flocked to the eastern hills. In the 1860s, mining carried on, in a large scale, with quicksilver mines operating in many areas of Napa County. The most noted mine was the Silverado Mine, near the summit of Mount Saint Helena. At this time, the first wave of rural, foreign laborers from coastal villages of China&#x27;s Canton province arrived in California and at Napa County mines. A settlement for Chinese laborers in Napa was established in the early 1860s. At its peak from the 1880s to the early 1900s, the Chinese population grew to a population of over 300 people.

In 1869, F. A. Sawyer established Sawyer Tanning Company in Napa and was joined in the business by his father B. F. Sawyer a year later. It went on to become the largest tannery west of the Mississippi River. The world-famous Nappa leather or Napa leather was invented by Emanuel Manasse in Napa in 1875 while working at the Sawyer Tanning Company.

Napa was incorporated on March 23, 1872, and reincorporated in 1874 as the City of Napa.

The Napa State Hospital received its first patients in 1876. The Napa Valley Opera House became popular after its debut on February 13, 1880, with a production of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;HMS Pinafore&quot;, but it later languished and was closed for many years. It was reestablished in the 1980s.

===Modern era===

Napa had become the primary business and economic center for the Napa Valley by the dawn of the 20th century. The San Francisco, Napa and Calistoga Railway was established in 1905 for passenger and freight service. The railroad carried passengers from ferry boats in Vallejo to stops in Napa and other locations in the valley.

As agricultural and wine interests developed north of the city limits, much of the light industry, banking, commercial and retail activity in the county evolved within the city of Napa and in earlier times along the Napa River through the historic downtown. Napa Glove Factory was established in 1903 and was the largest plant of its kind west of Chicago. 

Edwin Pridham and Peter L. Jensen invented the moving-coil loudspeaker in 1915 in their Napa workshop while working on an improvement for the telephone receiver. Pridham and Jensen went on to found the Magnavox Company in 1917. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Napa was known for having a sizable red-light district, with brothels primarily concentrated on and around Clinton Street.

Following studies made by the U.S. Department of the Interior in 1930-40s, the U.S. Congress authorized channel improvements on Napa River and construction of a dam on Conn Creek as part of the Flood Control Act of 1944, though funding was never approved. The City of Napa funded and built the dam in order to create the water conservation reservoir Lake Hennessey in 1948; however, flooding continued to be a problem. 

The 1986 Napa River flood revived public interest in finding a remedy. After a plan to widen the river channel proposed by the Army Corps of Engineers was presented in 1995 and roundly rejected, a group of special interests called Friends of the River formed, which built consensus on a &quot;living river&quot; plan. Voters in the County of Napa narrowly approved an increase of sales tax in a March 1998 election to fund the Napa River Flood Project. In 2005, the Napa River again flooded the entire downtown area and destroyed 1,000 homes across the county.

An ambitious redevelopment plan encompassing several blocks of downtown Napa&#x27;s retail property was undertaken by the city in the early 1970s, though it did little to improve the city&#x27;s economy. Downtown Napa finally began to recover and emerge from a long economic slumber in the 2000s, triggered by a significant growth in Main Street restaurants and hotels. The redevelopment of First and Main streets and the Napa Mill complex helped to stimulate investments along the Napa riverfront.

In 2014, the Napa area was struck by a magnitude 6.1 earthquake centered northwest of nearby American Canyon. In October 2017, the Atlas Fire and Partrick Fires burned several parts of Napa County (see also October 2017 Northern California wildfires).

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.69%, is water. Napa was the first location in California to be part of the North Coast American Viticultural Area. Renowned for its wine due to the Mediterranean climate, surprisingly only about 9% of Napa&#x27;s acreage is planted with grapes.

The Napa River traverses the city on its journey to the San Pablo Bay. The city has conducted a variety of waterfront development along the banks of the river, including certain fill operations governed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers regulations. The Napa River Flood Project has been in progress since the late 1990s, with the goal of mitigating the risk of flooding along a stretch of the river and of Napa Creek.

===Climate===
Napa has a Mediterranean climate similar to many other parts of Northern California. Winters are cool and damp and summers are warm and dry. During the summer months rain is rare. Occasionally there may be a day or two of light rain in June and September. Heat waves do occur, with the temperatures rising above . Wildfires can be a problem during the summer months. The fall is pleasant and many people come to visit Napa at this time. The winters are quite wet and cool and flooding can be a problem. Nighttime temperatures occasionally drop below freezing (). The rainy season is from October to April and occasionally into May. Snow is rare. The hottest temperature recorded in Napa was on September 6, 2022, while the coldest temperature recorded was on December 22, 1990.
