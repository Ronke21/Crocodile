<text>Sandwich is a city in DeKalb and Kendall counties in the U.S. state of Illinois. Its population was 7,421 at the 2010 census and 7,221 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The town&#x27;s history is tied to politician &quot;Long John&quot; Wentworth and his efforts to move the Illinois border with Wisconsin from being even with the bottom of Lake Michigan to its present location. If those efforts had not been successful, the state line would reside along the LaSalle-DeKalb County border, placing the incorporated community in Wisconsin. The community was established when Almon Gage sought a railroad stop on the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad that ran through town. Originally naming it Newark Station (not to be confused with the nearby village of Newark) he and Wentworth worked extensively to create the community and also to get the railroad stop created. In honor of his efforts, Wentworth was given the opportunity to name the town. He named it after his home of Sandwich, New Hampshire. The city&#x27;s Wentworth Apartments and Wentworth Street are named after him.

===Sandwich Fair===
Sandwich is the home of the Sandwich Fair, which first started as an annual livestock show in DeKalb County. Originally known as the Union Agricultural Institute, it first opened in 1858. Since 1888, it has been held yearly on the Wednesday through Sunday after Labor Day. It is one of the oldest continuing county fairs in Illinois, drawing daily crowds of more than 100,000, with top attendance days reaching over 200,000. In 2020, the Fair was cancelled for the first time in its history due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Features===
Within the city limit of Sandwich, there is a network of creeks, which either connect to Somonauk Creek (Lake Holiday), Little Rock Creek, or to the Fox River. Lake Davis, which stretched from Veterans Memorial Park to what is now Gletty Road, was drained early in the 19th century to open up additional farmland. The Sandwich town site was built on a natural gradation due to a geological fault line known as the Sandwich Fault, so the city stands on a hillside. The southeast corner of the city is the lowest spot, roughly near the Harvey Creek Preserve, as well as near Little Rock Creek. The last earthquake along the Sandwich Fault was on February 10, 2010, with a previous tremor being reported in January 2007.

===Climate===
Sandwich&#x27;s climate is typified by large seasonal temperature variances, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Dfa&quot;. (Hot Summer Continental Climate).

<doc id="111102" wikidata="Q1944217" url="?curid=111102" title="Somonauk, Illinois">
<text>Somonauk is a village in DeKalb and LaSalle Counties in the U.S. state of Illinois. The population was 1,786 at the 2020 Census, down from 1,893 at the 2010 Census.

The DeKalb County portion of Somonauk is part of the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI Metropolitan Statistical Area, while the small portion that lies in LaSalle County is part of the Ottawa, IL Micropolitan Statistical Area.

== Early history ==
The name &quot;Somonauk&quot; is of Pottawatomie origin. The name is most likely derived from the phonetic phrase &quot;As-sim-in-eh-kon&quot;, which translates to &quot;pawpaw grove&quot;, in reference to the vast groves of pawpaw trees that filled the area at that time.

The Second Treaty of Prairie du Chien, signed by General John McNeil Jr., Colonel Pierre Menard, and Caleb Atwater for the United States on June 29, 1829, references four sections of land being reserved for Chief Awn-kote and his band of 171 villagers &quot;at the village of Saw-meh-naug along the Fox and Illinois Rivers&quot;. The &quot;Saw-meh-naug&quot;, along with the other Pottawatomie of the Illinois River (known as the Prairie Group), as well as the Sauk and the Chippewa, had aided the U.S. in the Black Hawk War. After the war, as a thanks to the Pottawatomie, the U.S. Government signed a treaty allowing the Prairie Group tribes to continue to hunt on U.S. land, outside of their allocated reservations. However, due to &quot;rumors of the Pottawatomie being restless and committing depredations in the northern part of the state spreading to central Illinois&quot;, and white residents of the state feeling uncomfortable, the Governor &quot;gave the Prairie Group an ultimatum to leave Illinois&quot;. By the end of December 1833, the Pottawatomie had left Illinois, and the settlements of the Pottawatomie were free to be claimed by white settlers.

A few months later, in the spring of 1834, the first white settler in DeKalb County had set up shop along a tributary to the Fox River, and the name Somonauk was moved from the area of present-day Ottawa, to where Chicago Road, Governor Beveridge Highway, and Somonauk Creek meet. This is the area known as present-day &quot;Franks&quot;. The simple log cabin was used as a station house along the Chicago-Galena mail route between Aurora and Genoa, and would eventually become property of the Beveridge family. This cabin was the first post office in Somonauk Township, and the area both east and west of Somonauk Creek would eventually have 30 settlers, establishing a Presbyterian Church in the same area as the present-day church, and a school house directly across from it on the west side of Governor Beveridge Highway. It&#x27;s also widely known that this church was a stop on the underground railroad.

Later, in 1836, the post office for the settlement of Somonauk was moved to the intersection of Chicago Road and Somonauk Road and the name would be changed to &quot;Somonauk Crossing&quot;. Another post office was established in 1850 on Somonauk Road at present-day Buck Lake, and was known as &quot;Buck&#x27;s Branch&quot;. In 1851, the CB&amp;Q railroad finally made its way through the township, and in 1853, built a station along the line 5 miles south of the early settlement (now known as &quot;Franks&quot;), just north of the LaSalle/DeKalb County border. With that, the name &quot;Somonauk&quot; would make one final move to its current location, being in platted in 1855, and incorporated in 1865. &quot;Somonauk Crossing&quot; then became known as &quot;Freeland Corners&quot;. The name of Buck&#x27;s Branch would change to &quot;Somonoc Depot&quot; for a brief time before the post office was moved to the actual Somonauk railroad depot in December 1855. The closing of &quot;Freeland Corners&quot; post office was such a hardship to the farmers of Freeland Corners and Somonauk Crossing, that they petitioned the Post Office Department to establish another office in the location of Frank Richey&#x27;s creamers, and that it be called Frank&#x27;s Post Office. A post office was established in November 1891, once again located in the area of Chicago Road and Somonauk Creek, this time, on the west side of Rimsnider Road, just north of the creek. The post office was discontinued in April 1902, lasting a mere 11 years.

==Geography==
Somonauk is located at (41.6327194, -88.6865175). The village is situated along the boundary between DeKalb and LaSalle counties. In the 2000 census, 1,190 of Somonauk&#x27;s 1,295 residents (91.9%) lived in DeKalb County and 105 (8.1%) lived in LaSalle County.

According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Somonauk has a total area of , of which (or 99.76%) is land and (or 0.24%) is water.

Sannauk Forest Preserve serves as the unofficial boundary between Somonauk and Sandwich, which resides to the east. The forest preserve, owned and managed by DeKalb County, sits along Somonauk Creek, a tributary of the Fox River.

During the housing bubble of the mid-2000s, a few new subdivisions were planned to be built north of town. When the housing market crashed, the city had already incorporated a large portion of DeKalb county north of town ranging from the Sandwich Township border to Governor Beverage Highway, remaining south of Pratt Road. Since then, no talk has indicated that the subdivisions will be built.

The nearby Lake Holiday area includes a man-made lake created by the damming of Somonauk Creek. An old gravel pit was also flooded and is part of the lake.

==Education==
The village of Somonauk is served by Somonauk Community Unit School District (CUSD) #432 which offers grades Pre-K–12. The school&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Bobcats. School colors are blue and gold. The school&#x27;s song is titled &quot;Bobcat Loyalty&quot;, and is a basic spin-off of the University of Illinois&#x27; fight song, named &quot;Illinois Loyalty&quot;.

The community adjoins a private community known as &quot;Lake Holiday&quot;. Somonauk School District covers most of the west side of the lake as well as a section of the southeast side. Sandwich Community Unit School District 430 covers most of the east side and a two small sections on the west side of the lake.

<text>Sycamore is a city in DeKalb County, Illinois, United States. It has a commercial district based and centered on Illinois Route 64. The population was 18,577 at the 2020 census, up from 17,419 at the 2010 census. Sycamore is the county seat of DeKalb County and was named after the sycamore tree.

==History==
===Early settlement===
The first European settlers to the Sycamore-area arrived in 1835 and concentrated themselves mostly north of the Kishwaukee River (the name of which means Sycamore) and the present site of Sycamore. The original town was platted by a New Yorker named Christian Sharer. A mill was constructed and the Kishwaukee dammed but the town failed. By 1837, after some controversy, the location of county seat was settled in favor of Orange, Sycamore&#x27;s original name, and the settlement moved to the present-day site of the city.

The present-day town site was platted by James Waterman and Evans Wharry in 1837 (the same year Chicago was founded). The first settler at the new site was Carlos Lattin, who preceded the town, having arrived in 1835. Lattin staked a claim that included most of the present west side of the city and erected his first cabin just north of downtown.

===County seat location===
Early in the city&#x27;s history, it seemed that Sycamore might not be the location of the DeKalb County Courthouse: other towns were vying for the county seat title. A now-defunct town called Brush Point was the choice of a Dr. Henry Madden; and the Clerk of the Court Rufus Colton would have preferred Coltonville, where he made his home. Colton had set the first session of county court to be held at his home in Coltonville. In his attempt to make Coltonville the county seat, Colton decided to hold a new election for the status in 1837. Colton made sure that Coltonville would win the election by telling only the population of Coltonville about it. His political tactics were eventually cancelled by an act of the Illinois General Assembly, after the DeKalb County court intervened. When court convened the sheriff served a court order declaring Sycamore had built a Courthouse and that the Court session should be held there. Afterward, Coltonville eventually suffered the same fate as Brush Point and disappeared from the map. These events settled for a time the issue of where the courthouse and, in turn, the DeKalb County seat was going to be located.

In 1903, as the county prepared to construct a new courthouse, the debate over county seat was reignited. This time, it was the city of DeKalb that sought to wrest the title of county seat away from Sycamore. Two of DeKalb&#x27;s most prominent citizens, Jacob Haish and Isaac L. Ellwood, each promised to donate $20,000 to help absorb some of the new building&#x27;s cost. The city of Sycamore responded, raising funds of their own, and after some back and forth and legal wrangling, the issue was settled in Sycamore&#x27;s favor.

===Later settlement===
Following the end of the second county seat controversy, in 1839, the first DeKalb County Courthouse was built in the city, as well as Sycamore&#x27;s first hotel. A year later the settlement consisted of 12 houses, which increased to 18 by 1844. Sycamore then began an era of steady growth marked by population increases in 1848 to 262, 1849 to 320, 1850 to 390, 1851 to 435. The Sycamore and Cortland Railroad arrived in the late 1850s and a station was erected in Sycamore. Sycamore was home to 41 commercial and industrial business by 1855. In 1858, Sycamore was incorporated as a village. Following the American Civil War the railroad began to assist Sycamore&#x27;s growth and the settlement was incorporated as a city in 1869.

===Maria Ridulph murder===
Sycamore is the location of a notable cold case, the 1957 abduction and murder of 7-year-old Maria Ridulph. On the evening of December 3, 1957, Maria disappeared while playing outside her family&#x27;s Sycamore home. She was last seen by her playmate Kathy Chapman (née Sigman) with a young man who called himself &quot;Johnny&quot; and had approached the girls offering them piggyback rides. A search and investigation by local and state police and the FBI failed to locate either Maria or &quot;Johnny&quot;, and the following April, Maria&#x27;s body was found in a field approximately 100 miles from Sycamore. The case remained unsolved for over 50 years until in 2011, Jack Daniel McCullough, a former neighbor of the Ridulphs, was arrested and convicted of kidnapping and murdering Maria. The case received national news coverage as the oldest cold case in US history to result in a conviction. However, in April 2016, McCullough&#x27;s conviction was overturned and he was released from prison after a post-conviction review of the evidence indicated that he could not have committed the crime.

===2010 earthquake===

On the morning of February 10, 2010 at 3:59 a.m., Sycamore was near the epicenter of an earthquake. The shock had a moment magnitude of 3.8 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IV (&quot;Light&quot;). It was felt away in Madison, Wisconsin. When the quake was first reported, it was thought Sycamore was the epicenter. However, revised data from the USGS determined the epicenter to be closer to Virgil. This was the first earthquake in Northern Illinois since an M4.2 (intensity V (&quot;Moderate&quot;)) event in 2004.

<text>Arcola is a city in Douglas County, Illinois, United States. The population was 2,927 at the 2020 census. The city was founded in 1855, when the Illinois Central Railroad was built through the county. The railroad itself was responsible for surveying, platting and founding the town.

==History==
The city was named Arcola after the town of Arcole, Italy, where the Battle of Arcole took place.

Arcola was the birthplace in 1880 of John Barton Gruelle, or &quot;Johnny&quot; Gruelle, who created Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy, the loveable American dolls and storybook characters. He used artistic skills learned from his painter father, Richard Buckner Gruelle, combined with his self-taught writing skills to create stories expressing regional values and aesthetic images. His artistic granddaughter, Joni Gruelle Wannamaker, manages the Raggedy Ann Museum in Arcola.

In 1904 Arcola was one of the towns selected to have a Carnegie Public Library built. The Arcola Carnegie Public Library was finished in 1905 and eventually was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.
A nationally known tourist attraction, Rockome Gardens, which featured large formal gardens, concrete fencing and architecture, and many Amish-influenced attractions was located just outside of Arcola. Rockome Gardens was built in 1937 and was operated for nearly 80 years by members of the local Old Order Amish community. In 2015, the Rockome Gardens property was sold to a local developer and has since been converted into Aikman Wildlife Adventure, a drive-through wildlife park which officially launched in 2016.

Arcola is also known for housing the world&#x27;s only Hippie Memorial, created by Bob Moomaw, who died in 1998. He worked as a railroad clerk and tax assessor, but did not like either job. As an eccentric, independent artist with strong beliefs, he was able to give voice to his feelings, passions and opinions through his art and the writing on the sides of his buildings. He created the 62-foot-long artwork starting in 1992 to say something about his life and the era during which he lived. A nearby marker gives an interpretation of his work.

In the countryside surrounding nearby Arthur, Illinois, is a prominent community of Old Order Amish, the largest in Illinois. Amish farms occupy much of the farmland west of Arcola, with the highest concentration of Amish businesses around Arthur and the unincorporated communities of Chesterville, Bourbon, and Cadwell. Arcola is home to the Illinois Amish Interpretive Center. The Old Order Amish Museum opened in 1996 and features exhibits on most aspects of Amish life, as well as an introductory video about the Central Illinois Amish. Through the museum, tours can be scheduled of the Amish countryside, Amish homes, farms, and businesses; meals in Amish homes can be scheduled as well.

Arcola is somewhat known for the Lawn Rangers, a &quot;precision lawn mower drill team&quot; that marches in formation with brooms and lawn mowers while wearing cowboy hats. Every year since 1980, the Lawn Rangers have marched in the Arcola Broom Corn Festival Parade. The event, held the weekend after Labor Day, honors Arcola&#x27;s position in the late 19th century as a center of broom corn production. The Grand Marshal of the Parade in 1980 was Clayton Moore, famous as the Lone Ranger, and the team was named in his honor. This unique custom was publicized by humor columnist Dave Barry, who marched with the Lawn Rangers in 1995.

Arcola is also home to Libman Company. This mop and broom making company can boast to be the only major cleaning product company that manufactures their mops and brooms in America. The nickname &quot;broomtown&quot; was given to Arcola because William Libman is a major employer of the city employing 600 people.

The first village election was held on June 12, 1877, and C. G. McComb, Matt Hunsaker, W. H. Reeder, H. C. Jones, J. W. Sears, and Nick Thompson were elected trustees, and J. W. Barrum, clerk.

The original town was laid out on the farms of M. H. Warren on the Moultrie County side and the Pendleton Murphy farm on the Douglas County side. Early additions to the town included those by Murphy, Reeves, Hunsaker, Gibson, Warren, Reeder, followed by Kensington, Campbell, Boyd, Bennet, Fitzjarrald, and others.

On April 7, 1998, an F2 tornado struck south of Cadwell and moved northeast to south of Arthur. It lifted near Bourbon. Twenty homes, six barns, and other buildings were either damaged or destroyed. One mobile home was blown off its foundation. There were eight injuries.

In 2022, the community council revealed a flag for the village to celebrate its sesquicentennial. The new flag is flown in front of the welcome center and the police department. The new flag was put up upon the start of the Strawberry Festival.

<text>Tuscola is a city and the county seat of Douglas County, Illinois, United States. The population was 4,636 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The city of Tuscola was named an unknown Native American tribe&#x27;s word for &quot;flat plain.&quot;

The founding Supervisor of Tuscola township was O. C. Hackett, who was elected in 1868. Hackett was elected Supervisor with a majority of only one vote over W. B. Ervin. O. C. Hackett was the grandson of noted Kentucky frontiersman and Boonsborough resident Peter Hackett. O. C. planted Hackett&#x27;s Grove, a sassafras grove situated on Section 31, Township 16, Range 9, on the east side of the township. This grove is traversed by a branch of Scattering Fork of the Embarrass River, long known as Hackett&#x27;s Run. According to the History of Douglas County (1884), the grove had been owned by the Hacketts long before Douglas County came into existence. O.C. Hackett&#x27;s father, John Hackett, settled in nearby Coles County in 1835. Family legend holds that Abraham Lincoln stayed at the Hackett farm during the Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858.

From the 1890s to the 1940s, Tuscola had a sizeable number of African-American citizens, including Arthur Anderson, the &quot;most graceful walker&quot; at the 1898 Colored Folks Cake Walk in Tuscola; his partner Cozy Chavous; the musician Cecil &quot;Pete&quot; Bridgewater, father of internationally known musicians Cecil Bridgewater and Ronnie Bridgewater; the educator and musician Ruth Calimese, daughter of automobile worker &quot;Big Jim&quot; Calimese; musician Solomon &quot;Sol&quot; Chavous; mail carrier and war veteran Bruce Hayden (father of distinguished violinist Bruce Hayden, Jr.); Lemuel and Nettie Riley; football star and garage owner Tommy Wright; and dozens of other people. Tuscola had two churches with mainly black congregations, the African Methodist Episcopal Church on North Niles, and the White Horse Riders church on Houghton Street. Unlike the neighboring town of Arcola, Tuscola did not have the ordinance, common in small Illinois towns at the time, that an African-American person could not be on the streets after sundown. The black and white people of Tuscola got along well. However, between 1922 and 1924 two large Ku Klux Klan gatherings were held in Tuscola. The 1924 rally consisted of nearly 2,000 Klan cars, a hundred marching Klansmen, burning crosses, and a naturalization ceremony in Tuscola&#x27;s Ervin Park.

<doc id="111113" wikidata="Q575303" url="?curid=111113" title="Villa Grove, Illinois">
<text>Villa Grove is a city in Douglas County, Illinois, along the Embarras River. The population was 2,472 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Villa Grove was chartered in 1903 after the area was recognized by the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad (C&amp;EI) as being exactly halfway between Chicago and St. Louis. This made it a desirable location for a steam locomotive repair facility. Villa Grove later became the site of a C&amp;EI division headquarters and roundhouse.

Villa Grove was known for its Pancake Festivals in the 1940s, which drew crowds over 10,000. In the 1970s, the festival was replaced by the Ag Days celebration. Ag Days currently offers carnival rides, a car show, a parade, multiple vendors, live music, and a demolition derby.

In 1923, Villa Grove&#x27;s high school basketball team, the Blue Devils, defeated Rockford 32–29 to win the Illinois High School Boys Basketball Championship.

Villa Grove&#x27;s historic rail depot was demolished in the predawn hours of Friday, October 29, 1976, despite a city ordinance that was intended to protect the structure. The city later received reparation for the destruction. 

On August 10, 2011, a 100-year-old vacant building on main street in Villa Grove was destroyed by a fire set by a two boys age 14 and 9. At least 15 fire departments responded to the blaze containing it to the original structure. The boys were ordered to pay $126,076 in restitution. The 14-year-old received 3 years probation, 30 days in jail and 100 hours of community service. The 9 year old received 2 years probation and 50 hours community service. State law prohibited jail time for the 9 year old. Adjacent businesses were temporarily displaced due to damage caused by smoke and heat.

=== Flooding ===
Villa Grove&#x27;s location at the confluence of Jordan Slough and the Embarras River has resulted in flooding during the city&#x27;s history. In January 1950, Villa Grove was isolated by flooding, more than 1/3 of the city was underwater and the Red Cross reported 100 families were homeless. Another flood in April 1994 left over half of the city&#x27;s 1,000 homes flooded and the city&#x27;s water supply was tainted. At one point, portions of main street were 6 feet underwater.

After the severe flooding in 1994 and additional flooding in the following years, a program was implemented to purchase and demolish homes voluntarily from owners in the flood plain. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA) used the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) to purchase 17 homes in two phases from 1995 to 2000. IEMA noted that when another flood occurred in June 2008, the 17 properties purchased would have again been flooded had they not been purchased and demolished. Additional plans were also made to purchase more flood prone properties after the 2008 flood. After flooding in April 2013, FEMA again provided funding to purchase and demolish eight more homes and one public building in Villa Grove under HMGP.

These improvements have minimized the amount of area impacted by flooding. In 2021, a new bridge was built on Illinois Route 130 over the river. The new bridge is at a higher elevation and allows for better drainage. These improvements have resulted in minimal flooding in the area in recent years.

== Local Economy ==
Villa Grove is situated far enough from Champaign-Urbana that it can support several restaurants and businesses. The city currently supports several restaurants, bars, two gas stations, two grocery stores, and a nine-hole golf course and country club. There are several parks that provide various playing fields and the city has recently built a new community center for rec-teams to play in. 

== City Services ==
The City of Villa Grove maintains a full-time administrative staff, public works department, police department, and a paid on-call fire department. The city recently sold its water and sewer utilities to Illinois American Water.

<text>Addison is a village in DuPage County, Illinois, United States. The population was 35,702 at the 2020 Census. It is part of the Chicago metropolitan area.

==History==
The village was incorporated in 1884, at which time it had a population of 400. The community itself was originally named Dunkley&#x27;s Grove after the settler Hezekiah Dunklee, and was renamed after a town in England or Addison, New York. In 1832, Winfield Scott built Army Trail Road on top of a Potawatomi trail in Addison, in order to allow 50 broad-tired wagons to fight Black Hawk and his warriors. In 1864, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod moved its teacher training to the village from Fort Wayne, Indiana, and established the Addison Teachers Seminary; it remained in Addison until 1913, when it was relocated to River Forest, Illinois, as Concordia Teachers College (now Concordia University Chicago). The town was also home to the Kinderheim home for children, which made up more than half its population prior to suburbanization.

The town began to suburbanize in the 1960s when developers started to build homes on what was farmland. The population grew from just under a thousand in 1930 to 35,000 people in 1990.

Adventureland amusement park was located in Addison (Lake and Medinah) during the 1960s and 1970s. The Addison Industrial District was the proposed location for the reconstruction of Comiskey Park in the late 1980s before this was voted down.

<doc id="111115" wikidata="Q22595" url="?curid=111115" title="Aurora, Illinois">
<text>Aurora is a city in northeastern Illinois, United States, located along the Fox River. The population was 180,542 at the 2020 census. It is the second-most populous city in Illinois, after Chicago, and the 144th-most populous city in the US. Aurora is the most populous city in Illinois that is not the county seat of any county that it resides in.

Founded within Kane County, Aurora&#x27;s city limits have expanded into DuPage, Kendall, and Will counties. Once a mid-sized manufacturing city, Aurora has grown since the 1960s into a large city within the Chicago metropolitan area. In 1908, Aurora adopted the nickname &quot;City of Lights&quot;, because in 1881 it was one of the first cities in the United States to implement an all-electric street lighting system.

Aurora&#x27;s historic downtown is centered on Stolp Island. The city is divided into three regions, the West Side, East Side, and Far East Side/Fox Valley. The Aurora area has some significant architecture, including structures by Frank Lloyd Wright, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Bruce Goff and George Grant Elmslie. Aurora is also home to over 50 Sears Catalog Homes and seven Lustron all-steel homes. The Hollywood Casino Aurora, a dockside gaming facility with and 1,200 gaming positions, is located along the river in downtown Aurora.

==History==

Before European settlers arrived, there was a Native American village in what is today downtown Aurora, on the banks of the Fox River. In 1834, following the Black Hawk War, the McCarty brothers settled on both sides of the river, but subsequently sold their land on the west side to the Lake brothers, who opened a mill. The McCartys lived on and operated a mill on the east side. Aurora was established with the building of a post office in 1837.

Aurora began as two villages: East Aurora, incorporated in 1845 on the east side of the river, and West Aurora, formally organized on the west side of the river in 1854. In 1857, the two towns joined, incorporating as the city of Aurora. Representatives could not agree which side of the river should house the public buildings, so most of them were built on or around Stolp Island in the middle of the river.

As the city grew, it attracted numerous factories and jobs. In 1849, after failing to attract the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad building west from Chicago, the Aurora Branch Railroad was chartered to build a connection from Aurora to the G&amp;CU at a place called Turner Junction, now West Chicago. Additional lines were built, including a direct line to Chicago, and in 1855 the company was reorganized into the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. The CB&amp;Q located its roundhouse and locomotive shop in Aurora, becoming the town&#x27;s largest employer until the 1960s. Restructuring in the railroad industry resulted in a loss of jobs as passenger traffic dropped and the number of railroads decreased. The Burlington Railroad ran regularly scheduled passenger trains to Chicago. Other railroads built lines to Aurora, including the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway to Geneva, the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway to Joliet, Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; Gary to Rockford, and the interurbans Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad, Aurora, Elgin and Fox River Electric Company, Chicago, Aurora and DeKalb Railroad, and Aurora, Plainfield and Joliet Railroad. With the exception of the EJ&amp;E main line on the east side of the city, all lines other than the former Burlington lines have been abandoned.

The heavy industries on the East side provided employment for generations of European immigrants, who came from Ireland, Great Britain, Scandinavia, Luxembourg, Germany, France, Romania and Italy. Aurora became the economic center of the Fox Valley region. The combination of these three factors—a highly industrialized town, a sizable river that divided it, and the Burlington railroad&#x27;s shops—accounted for much of the dynamics of Aurora&#x27;s political, economic, and social history. The city openly supported abolitionism before the American Civil War. Mexican migrants began arriving after the Mexican Revolution of 1910. Socially, the town was progressive in its attitude toward education, religion, welfare, and women. The first free public school district in Illinois was established in 1851 here and the city established a high school for girls in 1855.

During this period in the city&#x27;s history, Aurora was also hit with one of the strongest earthquakes ever to strike Illinois, a M 5.1, on May 26, 1909

Later, the city developed as a manufacturing powerhouse which lasted until the early 1970s, when the railroad shops closed. Many other factories and industrial areas relocated or went out of business. By 1980, there were few industrial areas operating in the city, and unemployment soared to 16%. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, development began in the Far East side along the Eola Road and Route 59 areas. This was financially beneficial to the city, but it sapped retail businesses downtown and manufacturing in the industrial sectors of the near East and West Sides, weakening them. In the mid-1980s crime rates soared and street gangs formed.

During this time Aurora became much more ethnically diverse. The Latino population grew rapidly in the city during the 1980s. In the late 1980s, several business and industrial parks were established on the city&#x27;s outskirts. In 1993, the Hollywood Casino was built downtown, which helped bring the first redevelopment to the downtown area in nearly twenty years. In the late 1990s, more development began in the rural areas and towns outside Aurora. Subdivisions sprouted up around the city, and Aurora&#x27;s population soared.

===2014 air traffic control facility fire===
On September 26, 2014, a fire at an air traffic control edifice in Aurora (also known as the &quot;Chicago Center&quot;) caused nearly 2000 airline flights to be grounded.

Brian Howard, an employee of Harris Corporation, was charged in the incident.

===2019 shooting===

At approximately 1:30 p.m. on February 15, 2019, police responded to an active shooter situation in west Aurora to find that 45-year-old Gary Martin had opened fire on fellow employees at the Henry Pratt Company after being terminated from the company. Five officers and several civilians were injured in the ensuing standoff, after which police entered the building and killed Martin. In total, the incident left six dead (including the gunman) and numerous others wounded. It was the first major shooting in the town&#x27;s history.

==Geography==

Aurora is at (41.7637855, −88.2901352).

According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Aurora has a total area of , of which (or 97.94%) is land and (or 2.06%) is water.

While the city has traditionally been regarded as being in Kane County, Aurora also includes parts of DuPage, Kendall and Will counties. Aurora is one of only three cities in Illinois that span four counties the others being Barrington Hills and Centralia.)

The main building of Aurora Public Library and a branch campus of Waubonsee Community College are also located downtown.

The Riverfront Playhouse is a not-for-profit theater that has held a storefront location in downtown Aurora since 1978.

A fixture of Downtown Aurora, the Waubonsee Community College Campus, which was formerly located on Stolp Island near the Paramount Theatre, closed in May 2011. A new and greatly expanded campus was built on the western banks of the river, between the river and IL Route 31. The construction of the campus was part of a larger plan to redevelop the Downtown area, putting in parks and new walking paths, and making the area more inviting. The plan also included a pedestrian bridge to connect the banks of the river. Also in the works is a plan to modify or reconstruct the bridges to Stolp Island, which have not been maintained for nearly 60 years.

===Public education===
Starting in the 1860s, Aurora was served by two main school systems, one on either side of the Fox River, which physically divides the city. In the mid-20th century, the district on the western side of the river expanded to include the students in the village of North Aurora, including the North Aurorans on the east side of the Fox. Additionally, in 1972, the Indian Prairie School District (IPSD) 204 was formed to serve the far eastern portion of Aurora within DuPage County. All three districts (Aurora Public Schools: West Side (District 129), Aurora Public Schools: East Side (District 131) and IPSD) have their headquarters and administrative offices within the Aurora city limits. As of 2005, there were at least forty public schools within Aurora city limits, serving residents of Aurora and neighboring communities.

Due to the city&#x27;s size, these are not the only three school systems serving residents – some students in the far north end of the city (north of I88 in Kane County) attend Batavia public schools, some on the far southwest side attend Kaneland CUSD 302 schools (headquartered in Maple Park), and some students in the far south end of the city (a small corner of the Kane, Kendall and Will County portions) attend Oswego public schools. Four of the schools in Oswego CUSD 308, Wheatlands Elementary, Homestead Elementary, Wolf&#x27;s Crossing Elementary, and Bednarcik Junior High are within Aurora&#x27;s limits.

The Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy (IMSA) is a state-funded residential magnet school for grades 10 to 12. While IMSA operates under public funds (and uses the site originally designated West Aurora High School North Campus), it is managed independently of Aurora&#x27;s other public schools. Any Illinois student who meets admission requirements may apply to attend IMSA, tuition free.
The above-named districts have forty-six public schools within the city limits of Aurora (seventeen for District #131, thirteen for District #129, eleven for District #204, four for Oswego District #308 and the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy).
===Private education===
Aurora is also home to other private schools. Within Aurora, there are three Roman Catholic High Schools, Aurora Central Catholic (Diocese of Rockford), Rosary, and Marmion Academy (Order of St. Benedict), and seven Catholic elementary schools operated by the Diocese of Rockford. Along with these three schools is Aurora Christian High School and Elementary School and Resurrection Lutheran School, a Pre-K-8 grade school of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod. Aurora is also home to Fox Valley Montessori School, one of the first Montessori schools established in Illinois in 1969, which offers a preschool and elementary program.

===Library===
The Aurora Public Library includes the main library, two branches, an express center, a support facility and a bookmobile. The library operations budget is $10 million and the staff numbers 85 full-time and 89 part-time employees. The library was funded in 1901 through a Carnegie grant.

===Rail===
The city is the final stop of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe line of the Metra commuter rail system, allowing rail service into Chicago. The city also has a stop at the Rt. 59 station on the BNSF Line. This station is on the border with Naperville and each city maintains a parking lot on their respective side of the tracks. The BNSF Railway owns and maintains a rail yard in Aurora, which they named Eola Yard.

The Aurora Municipal Airport is a general aviation airport in Sugar Grove, Illinois, just outside Aurora. Although the airport is in Sugar Grove, it is owned and operated by the City of Aurora. The Aurora Airport is designed as a reliever airport for Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare and Midway Airports and also handles a lot of international cargo. It is capable of landing Boeing 757 aircraft. In addition, the Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s (FAA) Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center is on Aurora&#x27;s west side.

===Bicycle===
Aurora aims to be a bicycle-friendly community and promotes bicycling throughout the city. In July 2020, the City of Aurora partnered with Koloni to launch its new Fox Valley Bike Share program. The city has also invested in bike infrastructure improvement projects, further expanding the network of bike lanes and multi-use paths. The completion of a bridge in 2021 over the Fox River in Aurora provides a safe and direct route for bicyclists and pedestrians from the Aurora Transportation Center to the Fox River Trail.

Aurora does not have a stop for Amtrak trains, as the old station closed in the 1980s. The closest Amtrak station is in Naperville. Aurora City Lines, the old city bus lines, was closed in the late 1980s in favor of regional bus service. Greyhound buses used to stop at the Aurora Transportation Center, but service was discontinued on September 7, 2011. Aurora also had an extensive streetcar system, operated by the Aurora, Elgin and Fox River Electric Company, that operated until 1972.

<text>Batavia () is a city mainly in Kane County and partly in DuPage County in the U.S. state of Illinois. Located in the Chicago metropolitan area, it was founded in 1833 and is the oldest city in Kane County. Per the 2020 census, the population was 26,098.

During the latter part of the 19th century, Batavia, home to six American-style windmill manufacturing companies, became known as &quot;The Windmill City&quot;. Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, a federal government-sponsored high-energy physics laboratory, where both the bottom quark and the top quark were first detected, is located just east of the city limits.

Batavia is part of a vernacular region known as the Tri-City area, along with St. Charles and Geneva, all western suburbs of similar size and relative socioeconomic condition.

==History==
Batavia was settled in 1833 by Christopher Payne and his family. Originally called Big Woods for the wild growth throughout the settlement, the town was renamed by local judge and former Congressman Isaac Wilson in 1840 after his former home of Batavia, New York, which was in turn named after the Batavian Republic, a short-lived republic that existed from 1795 to 1806 in the present-day Netherlands. Because Judge Wilson owned the majority of the town, he was given permission to rename it.

Batavia&#x27;s settlement was delayed one year by the Black Hawk War, in which Abraham Lincoln was a citizen soldier, and Zachary Taylor and Jefferson Davis were Army officers. Although there is no direct evidence that Lincoln, Taylor, or Davis visited the future site of Batavia, there are writings by Lincoln that refer to &quot;Head of the Big Woods&quot;, Batavia&#x27;s original name. The city was incorporated on July 27, 1872.

After the death of her husband, Mary Todd Lincoln was an involuntary resident of the Batavia Institute on May 20, 1875. At the time the institute was known as Bellevue Place, a sanitarium for women. Mrs. Lincoln was released four months later on September 11, 1875. In the late 19th century, Batavia was a major manufacturer of the Conestoga wagons used in the country&#x27;s westward expansion. Into the early 20th century, most of the windmill operated water pumps in use by America&#x27;s farms were made at one of three windmill manufacturing companies in Batavia. Many of the limestone buildings of these factories remain in use as government and commercial offices, and storefronts. The Aurora Elgin and Chicago Railway constructed a power plant in southern Batavia and added a branch to the city in 1902. The Campana Factory was built in 1936 to manufacture cosmetics for The Campana Company, particularly Italian Balm, the nation&#x27;s best-selling hand lotion at the time.

<text>Bloomingdale is a village in DuPage County, Illinois, United States, settled in 1833, and 25 miles northwest of downtown Chicago. The population was 22,382 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Bloomingdale is one of the earliest villages settled in what is now DuPage County. The Meacham family settled here in 1833, and by the end of the following year, 12 to 15 families had settled in the locality. It was originally named Meacham&#x27;s Grove. The community was served by the Chicago-Galena Highway, modern day Lake Street. It became an important stop for stage coaches and westward travelers. Originally a Cook County settlement, it was annexed by DuPage County in 1839. The northern part of the village wanted to develop commercially while the southern part wished to remain a farming community. In 1923, the village split to accommodate this—the northern portion of the town was incorporated as Roselle. From 1950 to 1980, the population increased from 338 to 12,659.

The landmark U.S. Supreme Court case Illinois v. Gates began with an anonymous letter written to the Bloomingdale police department.

Similar to the neighboring village of Woodridge, almost all of the businesses, homes, churches and other buildings in Bolingbrook were built after 1960. The first settlement in what is now Bolingbrook was established in 1831, but the informal farming villages remained unincorporated for over 130 years. The area that is now Bolingbrook is located in the heart of the Gateway Wetlands, which begin in Downers Grove and end just north of the Joliet city limits. The tiny Boardman Cemetery, in what is now the Heritage Creek subdivision, contains the remains of some of these early residents. 

Modern Bolingbrook has its roots in the housing boom of the 1950s. The first subdivision in Bolingbrook, known as Westbury, was immediately west of Route 53. A second subdivision, known as Colonial Village, followed on the far east side of Route 53.

The village continued to grow steadily for the remainder of the 1960s, reaching a population of 7,000 by 1970. The 1970s were the first period of rapid growth in Bolingbrook, during which its population quintupled to reach over 37,000 by 1980. Much of this growth was as much due to mass annexation as well as raw population growth; the population of Bolingbrook by the 1970 census but with its 1980 land boundary was approximately 25,000, further reflecting the vigorous annexation that took place during the 1970s.

By 1990, Bolingbrook&#x27;s population had only increased by about 10% from the previous decade, to about 41,000.

==Economy==

==Government==
John J. &quot;Jack&quot; Leonard was instrumental in the village&#x27;s incorporation and served as the village&#x27;s first mayor.

In 1971, Bolingbrook purchased station 2 from the Lemont Fire Protection District, which had been serving much of the village, thus establishing its own fire department. Since then, that station has been expanded and four others have been built.

As of September 2024, the acting mayor of Bolingbrook is Mary Alexander-Basta. On July 31, 2020, longtime mayor Roger C. Claar resigned, having served in the role since 1986; Village Trustee Basta was unanimously appointed by the village board to complete Claar&#x27;s term.

It took its present name when it became the first school district in the United States to implement the 45-15 plan, in which schools were occupied year round with three-quarters of the students in session at any one time. Students went to school for 9 weeks and then had 3 weeks off. Additionally, teachers were optionally allowed to work year-round.

==Parks and recreation==

===Bolingbrook Park District===
The Bolingbrook Park District was created in 1970, after being approved by referendum. In 1974, the Park District built its first new building, the Deatherage-Drdak Center, constructed only with volunteer labor. In the following three decades the Bolingbrook Park District has grown to include numerous woodlands and parks, several community centers, the Pelican Harbor Indoor/Outdoor Aquatic Complex, and the Bolingbrook Recreation and Aquatic Complex (BRAC). Most recently, the Bolingbrook Park District was one of the four finalists for the National Gold Medal Award for Excellence in Park Management, Facilities and Programs.

In 1982, the Park District opened the first indoor wave pool in the United States. It was closed shortly after the BRAC and Pelican Harbor opened in 1996, and has since been converted to an ice skating arena.

In 2009, the Park District opened its Hidden Oaks Nature Center, which sits on 80 acres of woodland and river plain habitat. The Nature Center has a Platinum LEED Rating from the U.S. Green Building Council and was built from recycled materials. As of 2014, the Nature Center is used to run naturalist programs and summer camps. Animal residents include: coyotes, deer, great horned owls, and other species common to Northern Illinois.

===Golf===
Bolingbrook is home to the Boughton Ridge Golf Course, a nine-hole course owned by the Bolingbrook Park District. In addition, the Bolingbrook Golf Club, a municipal facility which includes an 18-hole course, is in the village. Other Golf Courses within proximity of Bolingbrook include Naperbrook GC, Tamarack GC, Wedgewood GC, and Links at Carillon (all in Plainfield), White Eagle GC and Springbrook GC in Naperville, Village Greens of Woodridge and Seven Bridges GC in Woodridge, Cog Hill GC in Lemont, and Mistwood GC in Romeoville.

===Aviation===
Clow International Airport is a small airport off of Boughton-Weber with an estimated runway. Clow is a public (non-commercial) airport, owned by the village and operated under a contract with a management company. In 1989, the airport was named the &quot;best privately owned, public use airport in Illinois.&quot; Currently, there are 70,000 take-offs and landings at the airport annually.

The Illinois Aviation Museum at Bolingbrook was formed in 2004. The museum is staffed by volunteers and is in a remodeled hangar at Clow International Airport, currently donated by the Village of Bolingbrook.

<text>Carol Stream is a village in DuPage County, Illinois, United States, and a suburb of Chicago. It was incorporated on January 5, 1959, and named after the daughter of its founder, Jay Stream. Per the 2020 census, the population was 39,854.

== History ==
In 1853, St. John Wahlund Catholic Church was built in what was then referred to as Gretna. The church was closed in 1867. When St. Michael&#x27;s was opened in Wheaton in 1872, St. Stephen&#x27;s parishioners were transferred to that parish. The church building was dismantled sometime in the late 19th century. St. Stephen&#x27;s Cemetery was located adjacent to the church building and was last used for burial in 1910. St. Stephen&#x27;s Cemetery (located north of the Great Western Trail behind the Ozinga concrete plant on St. Charles Road) was rededicated 100 years later on September 12, 2010.

In 1952, a farm from the area was featured on NBC; it was the site for the first outdoor telecast by the network in 1954.

A common misconception is that the municipality of Carol Stream was named for a local minor waterway. In fact, Carol Stream is one of the few communities in America that took its name from the first and last names of a living person: Carol Stream, the daughter of its founder Jay Stream. Carol Stream herself moved to Arizona as an adult, living there until her death on January 18, 2020.

Jay W. Stream (April 17, 1921 – January 22, 2006), a military veteran who had previously sold insurance and ready-mix concrete, was in the mid-1950s heading Durable Construction Company. He became frustrated with red tape while negotiating a planned 350–400 home subdivision in nearby Naperville, Illinois. A Naperville clerk reportedly advised Stream to &quot;build your own town&quot;, and in 1957, Stream began buying unincorporated farmland outside Wheaton. He hoped to allow people to work in the town they lived in, rather than have to commute to Chicago.

On August 26, 1957, Carol and three friends were returning from Racine, Wisconsin, in a 1949 Studebaker. While attempting to cross U.S. Route 45 in central Kenosha County, the car was struck in the right rear corner, killing 15-year-old Richard Christie of Chicago, the passenger seated there. Carol was ejected through the windshield and into a utility pole. Neurosurgeons at Kenosha Memorial Hospital said the comatose girl might never awaken or, if she did, would likely be severely handicapped. On advice of the doctors that her recovery might improve with good news, Jay decided to name the new community in her honor. After four months in a coma, Carol regained consciousness. Learning that the new village bore her full name, Carol said she thought it &quot;odd and silly&quot; at first (as she told &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reporter Eric Zorn in 1991).

Carol Stream was to be named Jacqueline Stream, but her parents changed her name to Carol when her due date fell near Christmas. She never lived in her namesake community, but moved from Wheaton, Illinois, to Arizona in 1957 following the end of her parents&#x27; marriage. She participated in municipal celebrations and rides in parades during anniversary celebrations of the municipality&#x27;s 1959 incorporation, and she was frequently asked for autographs when she was in town. She died in Arizona on January 18, 2020.

One of the town&#x27;s two middle schools, Jay Stream Middle School is named after the founder, Jay Stream, who died on January 22, 2006.

Its long winding streets go with the natural contour of the land, rather than extending straight through from the neighboring towns. In 1923, at the time of incorporation, Clarendon Hills had a population of under 900 people. The area was incorporated to avoid annexation by the nearby community of Hinsdale.

<text>Darien (formerly Cass) is a city in DuPage County, Illinois, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 22,011. A southwestern suburb of Chicago, Darien was named after the town of Darien, Connecticut. Darien is just north of I-55 and Historic U.S. Route 66 (now Frontage Road). The entire south edge of the town borders Waterfall Glen.

== History==
The first people to settle in Darien came from New England via the Erie Canal and Great Lakes. Among the first to arrive was the Andres Neiman, the Rapones, and the Capra family. They settled along an old stagecoach line in 1835. Andres served as Justice of the Peace, Town Clerk, and Assessor Mr. Capra was the Dog Catcher, and County Commissioner. He also established the Capra Inn, near what is currently the intersection of Lemont Road and I-55; the inn served the 15 stagecoaches that traveled the stagecoach line, and included a tavern and a post office. Andres named the area &quot;Cass&quot;.

Andres and Father Beggs along with Louis Capra Sr. built the First Cass Church, which was a log cabin. The church was also used as a school house.

Elisha and Eliza Smart settled in Cass in 1838 with their ten children. Elisha joined the Gold Rush and went to California, returning seven years later a very rich man. He bought more land and donated it for the construction of a new Cass Church in 1870. His brother, William Smart, donated land for the creation of Cass Cemetery.

John and Hannah Oldfield came to Cass in 1850. Mr. Oldfield raised cattle and increased his land holdings to .

In 1881, a man named Franklin Blanchard opened a cheese factory. The factory was eventually moved or closed; a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant now occupies the factory&#x27;s original location.

Martin B. Madden arrived with his parents in the Cass area in 1869 from England. In 1878 he married the youngest daughter of Elisha and Eliza Smart at her parents&#x27; house in Cass. In 1903, Mr. Madden built a home to look like the White House in Washington D.C. he called it Castle Eden. Today Castle Eden is part of the Aylesford Retreat Center of the Carmelite Fathers.

A group of German Lutherans from Europe came to the area near 67th and Clarendon Hills Road in 1859. They built the first St. John Lutheran Church and laid out the cemetery behind the church. Today the cemetery is still located at 67th and Clarendon Hills Road. In 1899, a new church was built on the northeast corner of Cass Avenue and 75th Street. In 1969, the second church was torn down and the present St. John&#x27;s Lutheran Church was built by Louis Capra Jr., west of Cass Ave and north of 75th Street.

A school was built on the northwest corner of Cass and 75th street in 1860. It was the first Lace School. It burned down in 1924, and was replaced with the present building. It is now a museum which is open on the first Sunday of each month from 2:00pm to 4:00pm.

By 1890, the Village of Lace was established. The important location at that time was the triangle bordered by Cass Avenue, Plainfield Road and 75th Street. It was called &quot;The Point&quot;. The Point included the Town Hall, General Store, the Capra Blacksmith Shop and the office of Dr. Roe. A Post Office had been established by the Rapones at The Point in 1884.

The future city of Darien was originally part of the Lace and Cass communities. As nearby Downers Grove began to expand in the 1960s, its city street grid began to extend into unincorporated areas past its southern borders. Residents of the Marion Hills, Brookhaven, Farmingdale and Hinsbrook subdivisions wanted to incorporate as a single city; this finally happened in 1969. When the incorporation committee reached an impasse on an acceptable name for the new city, acting mayor Sam Kelly suggested the name &quot;Darien&quot;. He had visited Darien, Connecticut, and found it to be a very pleasant and attractive community. Today, Darien is known as &quot;A Nice Place to Live&quot;, in honor of the city&#x27;s founding year 1969. Darien in Illinois is pronounced with the accent on the first syllable; Darien in Connecticut is pronounced with the accent on the last syllable.

On June 20, 2021, a large, violent EF3 tornado tore through several neighborhoods of Woodridge, and then into Darien. The tornado first formed in southern Naperville, causing 6 injuries, and 2 in critical condition. After the tornado crossed IL 53, it entered Woodridge, on top of 83rd St. The tornado at this point was nearing peak width, at or near 1/4 to 1/2 mile wide. The tornado then crossed I-355, and reached peak strength not too long later. The tornado reached a peak size of 0.25 – 0.5 miles wide with a debris ball around 2 miles wide. The tornado at this point was starting to enter Darien, causing even more damage there. The tornado crossed I-55 near the IL 83 interchange not too long later. At around 11:35pm, the tornado roped out in the southwest Chicago suburb of Willow Springs.

==Geography==
According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Darien has a total area of , of which (or 98.22%) is land and (or 1.78%) is water.

Darien&#x27;s City Hall used to be totally underground until 1994, when it was lifted up. Now only 75% is underground. Darien&#x27;s City Hall is surrounded on three sides by the village of Downers Grove.

The entire south edge of Darien backs up to Waterfall Glen Forest Preserve, which is home to one of the only old-growth, pine wood forests in the area. It also offers a 773-acre &quot;Bluff savanna&quot;, with hiking trails, horseback trails and boat access to the nearby Des Plaines River. The Rocky Glen Waterfall, located within the preserve, is a popular swimming destination in the summer. Darien is bordered by the cities of Downers Grove, Westmont, Woodridge, Lemont, and Willowbrook, and it has easy access to the three major thoroughfares crossing Chicago&#x27;s southwest suburbs: Interstate 55, Interstate 355, and Interstate 294.

<doc id="111122" wikidata="Q1007011" url="?curid=111122" title="Downers Grove, Illinois">
<text>Downers Grove is a village in DuPage County, Illinois, United States. It was founded in 1832 by Pierce Downer, whose surname serves as the eponym for the village. Per the 2020 census, the population of the village was 50,248. It is a south-western suburb of Chicago located between I-88 and I-55.

==History==
Downers Grove was founded in 1832 by Pierce Downer, a farmer who traveled to Illinois from Rutland, New York, but was originally from Vermont. Downers Grove was named for a lush grove of old-growth bur oak trees surrounding the village, which stood out from the local savanna landscape. Its other early settlers included the Blodgett, Curtiss, Blanchard, Stanley, Lyman, and Carpenter families. The original settlers were mostly migrants from the Northeastern United States and Northern Europe. In 1839, Reverend Orange Lyman, a presbyterian minister, and his wife Maria Dewey Lyman arrived, and built what is believed to be the first home in Downers Grove. The first schoolhouse was built in 1844. In 1846, the Blodgett house was built by Israel and Avis Blodgett. It was the second (or third) home built in Downers Grove. Both the Lyman and Blodgett homes are of cultural significance, as they were both built by abolitionist families and served as former stops on the Underground Railroad.

The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad was extended from Aurora to Chicago through Downers Grove in 1864, boosting its population. The town was incorporated in March 1873. Its somewhat unusual spelling (&quot;Apostrophe-free since 1873&quot;) remains a minor historical mystery.
In April 1947, the wreck of a Burlington Railroad &quot;Twin Cities Zephyr&quot; passenger train killed three people, including the engineer. The streamliner struck a large tractor which had fallen from a freight train and two passenger cars crashed through a wall of the Main Street Station.

The construction of two major toll roads along the village&#x27;s northern and western boundaries, I-355 in 1989, and what is now referred to as I-88 in 1958, facilitated the village&#x27;s access to the rest of Chicago metropolitan area. I-55 is not far from the south edge of the village. Downers Grove has developed into a bustling Chicago suburb with many diverse businesses, including the headquarters for Devry University, FTD, Ambitech Engineering Corp, Dover, Heartland Food Corporation, and HAVI Global Solutions.

===Housing===
The housing stock in Downers Grove comprises a mixture; some, generally near the center of town, date from the middle of the 19th century, but housing styles of each succeeding generation are represented. Downers Grove has witnessed one of the highest teardown rates in the Chicago area; small older residences are being demolished and replaced with much larger new houses. Teardowns have been the source of much controversy within the village. Since they occupy much more land than the original houses, rainwater that was originally absorbed by their yards is directed into neighboring yards and streets, resulting in flooding. Concerns have been raised that teardowns reduce affordable housing in the town and promote gentrification.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Downers Grove has a total area of , of which (or 98.98%) is land and (or 1.02%) is water. Only the DuPage County communities of Bartlett, Aurora, Naperville and Bolingbrook have larger land areas. Within the town are two forest preserves: Lyman Woods and Maple Grove Forest Preserve.

<text>Glen Ellyn is a village in DuPage County, Illinois, United States. A suburb located due west of downtown Chicago, the village has a population of 28,846 as of the 2020 Census.

==History==
Glen Ellyn, like the neighboring town to the east, Lombard, had its genesis in an 1833 claim by two brothers from the Finger Lakes region of New York, Morgan and Ralph Babcock. The two claimed property in a large stand of timber near present-day St. Charles Road and the East Branch of the DuPage River. The brothers also arranged for a claim for their New York neighbor Deacon Winslow Churchill, who arrived in 1834 along with some of his adult children and their families. The nascent settlement became known as Babcock&#x27;s Grove, and it included property currently part of both Glen Ellyn and Lombard.

Up the trail from the river to the west was a five-cornered intersection. In 1835, Daniel Fish built a cabin there, and other settlers followed. By the 1840s the intersection was called Fish&#x27;s Corners and held a general store, blacksmith&#x27;s forge, shops selling or repairing wagons and harnesses, and a Baptist church.

Moses Stacy, a soldier in the War of 1812, arrived in 1835 and built a house south of Fish&#x27;s Corners. In 1846, Stacy built at the five corners an inn, Stacy&#x27;s Tavern, to serve as a halfway stop between Chicago and the Fox River Valley and a probable stop for Galena, Illinois stagecoaches on their way to Rockford, Illinois. Stacy&#x27;s Tavern, now a historical monument, stands at what is now the intersection of Geneva Road and Main Street.

In 1849, construction of the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad through Glen Ellyn was finished. The railroad was about a mile south of the corners. At first, trains running through the town on the railway did not stop there. A local landowner, Lewey Quitterfield Newton, made an offer to the railroad company: Newton would provide land for a right-of-way and build a depot and water tank if the railroad would require trains to stop there. The depot that Newton built became known as Newton Station, and the locus of the community shifted to the area around the station.

The first church, a Congregational church, was built in 1862. Many Protestant churches were built in the village in the years to come. It was not until 60 years later that the first Catholic church was built.

The growing settlement went through several names, including Babcock&#x27;s Grove, DuPage Center, Stacy&#x27;s Corners, Newton&#x27;s Station, Danby (after Danby, Vermont, a local landowner&#x27;s birthplace) and Prospect Park. The current &quot;Glen Ellyn&quot; is based on the Welsh version of the name of village president Thomas E. Hill&#x27;s wife Ellen, preceded by &quot;glen&quot;, referring to the local geography.

The name Glen Ellyn had been adopted by 1889, when village president Hill and businessman Philo Stacy spearheaded a project to create a new lake, called Lake Glen Ellyn (today&#x27;s Lake Ellyn), by having a dam built in a nearby stream.

In 1890, residents discovered mineral springs near the village. This contributed to Glen Ellyn advertising itself as Chicago&#x27;s newest suburb and health resort, soon followed by the Village of Glen Ellyn being officially incorporated on May 10, 1892. The large Lake Glen Ellyn Hotel opened in 1892, the same year much of the business district was destroyed by fire. Fourteen years later, the hotel was struck by lightning and burned to the ground.

The village&#x27;s all-volunteer fire department was created in 1907. By the end of the 20th century, it was the last all-volunteer fire department in DuPage County.

By World War I, Glen Oak Country Club served the Oak Park and Glen Ellyn communities, and in 1922 the first Glenbard high school was built.

<text>Itasca () is a village in DuPage County, Illinois, United States. Per the 2020 Census, the population was 9,543. Located approximately 25 miles northwest of downtown Chicago, Itasca is close to O&#x27;Hare International Airport, major expressways and rail transportation. Itasca is home to a country club, a resort and shares a border with Medinah&#x27;s legendary golf course. &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; rated Itasca as the Best Affordable Suburb in the state of Illinois.

==History==
Itasca was first settled by Elijah Smith in 1841. Smith practiced medicine in Boston. In May 1841, at the advice of his colleagues he set out to find a suitable site for doctoring, farming, and raising a family. He traveled from New York via Detroit and headed toward DuPage County. His parchment government land title dated March 10, 1843, was signed by John Tyler, President of the United States. The document gave Smith title to the land that is now bounded by the railroad tracks on the south, Maple Street on the west, Cherry Street on the east, and Division Street on the north.
The post office was established in 1846 and took on various names, such as Bremen, Pierce (after Charles Pierce, who ran a trading post), and Sagon. The name &quot;Itasca&quot; comes from Lake Itasca. In the 1860s the first school was built. It was a small wooden structure with one room. The building was located on a site near the present First Presbyterian Church.

In 1873 Smith plotted eighty acres of his land into lots. The Chicago and Pacific Railroad was completed from Chicago to Elgin, with stations at Bensenville, Wood Dale (called Lester) and Itasca. Smith gave the right-of-way to encourage location of the tracks through the settlement. He donated $400 to help build a station.

The Chicago and Pacific Railroad became insolvent. In 1880 the road went into the hands of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, a newly formed corporation combining several rail networks.

The citizens of Itasca decided in 1890 to incorporate into a village. At a meeting at his mill, A. G. Chessman was elected the first Village President. Irving Park Road was first called the Chicago and Elgin Road. At an 1891 Village Board meeting, the name was changed to Elgin Avenue.

The 1900s

The Village of Itasca created a Historical Commission in 1985 to retain the aesthetic beauty, character, and historical integrity of the Village. The Village of Itasca is committed to the preservation of its pre-1900 and early 1900 homes, buildings, structures, and places.

In 1987, the Village adopted the Historic Preservation Ordinance which provides a mechanism to identify and preserve the special distinctive historic, aesthetic, architectural and/or landscaping characteristics of the Village&#x27;s cultural, social, economic, political and architectural history.

The Itasca Historical District includes the following area: Bounded on the north by North Street, on the south by Bloomingdale Road, east to Irving Park, Irving Park east to Rush Street; on the east by Cherry Street extended to Schiller Street then west to Rush Street, then south to Irving Park Road and on the west by Catalpa Avenue extended to Bloomingdale Road.

The Spire, which is Itasca&#x27;s most familiar landmark, graces the top of what was formerly the Lutheran Church of St. Luke. This edifice was erected in 1907 by builder Fred Westendorf. Pastor Frederick Zersen served the congregation for thirty-eight years. Church services were in German. It was not until 1926 that English services were held twice a month. German was also taught in the church school.
Until 1916, there was no bank in Itasca. Herman H. Franzen took deposits for Village residents to the Roselle Bank each morning, making the trip regularly on the 9:00 AM train. In 1916, two banks opened within weeks of each other. The Itasca State Bank had as its president H. F. Lawrence. The cashier was Elmer H. Franzen. The second bank was called the Dairyman&#x27;s Bank of Northern Illinois, and was opened by F. N. Peck. Peck opened a total of four banks, but the Depression forced him to close them all. The Franzen banks in Itasca, Roselle, and Fox Lake were sound throughout the hard times of the 1920s, and emerged successfully from the Depression.

Telephone service had come to Itasca in 1899. Electricity was first installed in some homes in 1923. The bustling community soon gained another facility. The Itasca Country Club was opened in the spring of 1925.

The rural village of the 1800s and early 1900s retained its atmosphere until the 1940s. A new word then began to enter the American vocabulary: suburb. The influence of the city increased as population increased. Commuting daily to the Loop became the routine for many of the Village wage earners. By 1982, the population had grown to 7,192. Annexations had resulted in fifty miles of Village streets, more parks, and two industrial areas to serve. Providing safety and service as population increased required the establishment of departments of public works, of sewer and water, of building and police. A park district, a Village library, and a fire district were formed.

High school students from Itasca attended Bensenville&#x27;s Fenton High School and Glenbard High School, a combined Glen Ellyn-Lombard school. A high school district, District 108, was organized in 1953. Lake Park High School, with students from Itasca, Roselle, Medinah, Keeneyville and Bloomingdale, opened in September 1956.

Modern industry was foreign to Itasca until 1961 when Central Manufacturing District (CMD) bought about 400 acres on the western edge of the village. An industrial park was established, and such national companies as Continental Can and FMC soon moved in. In 1970, the Itasca Industrial Park was established to the east of the Village, and attracted many more industries.

Anvan Corporation built a Holiday Inn on Irving Park east of Route 53. The building was of modular construction, the first such hotel in the nation to be built in this manner. 

In 1969, Carson Pirie Scott purchased Nordic Hills Country Club. Two 10-story tower hotel buildings were constructed adjacent to the eighteen-hole golf course. In 1973, the Carson Inn/Nordic Hills facility was annexed to the village. Today, it is the Eaglewood Resort.

In October 1979, Trammell Crow Company of Texas broke ground for Hamilton Lakes. A 420-room Stouffer Hotel and a ten-story office building, completed in 1981, constituted the first phase of the project, situated on 278 acres on the northwest edge of Itasca. To date 15 buildings out of an estimated 26 have been completed, amounting to 2,767,589 gross square feet of floor space with an ultimate development of 4,490,700 gross square feet. A 16-story office building was added to the complex in 1984.

In 1966, the Village purchased 60 acres of land south of Irving Park Road. This established a green belt area to ensure both open space and water retention. In 1968 the Spring Brook Nature Center was formed.

A Master Plan for this area was adopted in 1965, and continues to guide the community into its future. Itasca, having celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1990, continues to control its development according to the individuality of its past.

The overall growth and development of the Village has and is being controlled by the Comprehensive Plan that was first adopted in 1942 and has been amended in 1959, 1979, and 1993.

Shirley H. Ketter, the first female Mayor of Itasca monumentally served as Village President of Itasca from 1983 to 1997. Former Mayor Ketter is after whom Itasca&#x27;s &quot;Ketter Drive&quot; was named in 1999 in honor of her role with the Hamilton Lakes Business Park, which according to Mayor Gigi Gruber, Ketter &quot;created and developed the whole Hamilton project.&quot;

Outstanding residential neighborhoods, first-rate schools, and beautiful parks distinguish Itasca as a quality community. Most importantly, we have worked to retain our small town charm with a lovely historic district and churches of all architectural styles.

Each year Itasca hosts multiple notable events which includes, Itasca Fest, fireworks at Hamilton Lakes, and other events throughout the year. Itasca Fest is the second weekend of July which includes live music, food, beverages, rides, car shows, and more. The Hamilton Lakes fireworks are claimed to be the best and largest in Illinois.

<text>Lisle ( ) is a village in DuPage County, Illinois, United States. The population was 22,390 at the 2010 census, and in 2019 the population was recorded to be 23,270. It is a south-western suburb of Chicago in the Illinois Technology and Research Corridor. It is also the headquarters of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Region III.

==History==

In 1830, Bailey Hobson, a Quaker, was the first settler in what would become DuPage County, Illinois, as well as Lisle Township. The town of Lisle was settled in 1832, by brothers James C. Hatch and Luther A. Hatch after the close of the Black Hawk War. The two brothers acquired land near what is now Ogden Avenue and began a small farming community named &quot;DuPage&quot; or &quot;East DuPage&quot; because, of its proximity to the east branch of the DuPage River.

In 1831, DuPage County was founded. To the west of the Lisle settlement, on the west branch of the DuPage river, brothers Joseph and John Naper founded Naper&#x27;s Settlement, present-day Naperville, Illinois.

Lisle experienced many firsts in the decade of 1830s during the earliest years of settlement in DuPage County. In 1832, James C. Hatch set aside some of his land for the first and only community burial ground in the East DuPage Settlement. Today, Lisle Cemetery is one of the oldest registered cemeteries in the state of Illinois. Hatch operated the first wagon and blacksmith shop and began Lisle&#x27;s infant dairy industry with a creamery. Formed in 1833, the East DuPage Religious Society had a circuit rider preacher with house churches and was the first Christian organization in DuPage County, which later became the First Congregational Church of DuPage in 1842. The first post office was managed by John Thompson in 1834, and the first log schoolhouse was constructed in that same year and later replaced, in 1837, with a frame structure.

In 1849, DuPage County formed its first townships, and the name Lisle was first proposed by early settler Alonzo B. Chatfield of Lisle, New York; the proposal was accepted, creating the Lisle Township. The village was incorporated on June 26, 1956, and was also named after Lisle, New York. Another reason for the DuPage township name change was that there was another town in Will County with the name DuPage.

Another story of the origin of the Lisle name was that the town was named after the late S. Lisle Smith of Chicago.

In 1864, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad arrived along with a newly constructed depot. In 1874, a fire destroyed the Lisle Station depot, but it was later rebuilt by the CB&amp;Q Railroad. Today, commuter rail service is provided by Metra.

<text>Lombard is a village in DuPage County, Illinois, United States, and a suburb of Chicago. The population was 44,476 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Originally part of Potawatomi Native American landscape, the Lombard area was first settled by Americans of European descent in the 1830s. Lombard shares its early history with Glen Ellyn. Brothers Ralph and Morgan Babcock settled in a grove of trees along the DuPage River. In what was known as Babcock&#x27;s Grove, Lombard developed to the east and Glen Ellyn to the west. In 1837, Babcock&#x27;s Grove was connected to Chicago by a stagecoach line which stopped at Stacy&#x27;s Tavern at Geneva and St. Charles Roads. Fertile land, the DuPage River, and plentiful timber drew farmers to the area.

Sheldon and Harriet Peck moved from Onondaga, New York, to this area in 1837 to farm of land. In addition, Peck was an artist and primitive portrait painter who traveled to clients across northeastern Illinois. The Peck house also served as the area&#x27;s first school and has been restored by the Lombard Historical Society.
In 2011, the Peck House was inducted into the National Park Service&#x27;s Network to Freedom—a list of verified Underground Railroad locations.

The 1848 arrival of the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad provided local farmers and merchants rail access to Chicago, and commercial buildings soon sprang up around the train station. Lombard was officially incorporated in 1869, named after Chicago banker and real estate developer Josia Lewis Lombard.

===Women&#x27;s rights===
On April 6, 1891, Ellen A. Martin led a group of women to the voting place at the general store. She demanded that the three male election judges allow the women to vote. The judges were so surprised that one of them had a &quot;spasm,&quot; one leaned against the wall for support, and the other fell backwards into a barrel of flour. They acquiesced to Ellen, but fundamentally did not want to let the women vote, so a county judge was asked to decide. He agreed that the women were right. Ellen Martin then became the first woman in Illinois to vote, and one of the first in the entire U.S. In 1916 Illinois women could vote in national elections, but the 19th Amendment (the Women&#x27;s Suffrage Amendment) was not passed until 1920.

In 2008, Lombard declared April 6 to be &quot;Ellen Martin Day&quot; in commemoration of Ms. Martin&#x27;s historic victory for women&#x27;s suffrage.

===Little Orphan Annie House===
William LeRoy built a home in the Italianate style on Lombard&#x27;s Main Street in 1881. LeRoy specialized in making artificial limbs for civil war veterans and lived in this house until 1900. The house would eventually become the home of Harold Gray&#x27;s parents and the studio of Harold Gray, the originator of Little Orphan Annie cartoon strip. Harold Gray used the home&#x27;s study to work on the Annie cartoons, and some features of the house are drawn into some of his cartoons, such as the grand staircase and the outer deck. Gray lived at 215 S. Stewart Ave in Lombard at this time. Later, he remarried and moved to the east coast. Harold Gray was a charter member of Lombard Masonic Lodge #1098, A.F. &amp; A.M. in 1923. 

===The Lilac Village===
In 1927, the estate of Colonel William Plum, a local resident, was bequeathed to the village. The Plum property included his home, which became the site of the original Helen M. Plum Memorial Library (decommissioned in 2023), and a large garden containing 200 varieties of lilac bushes. This garden became a public park, Lilacia Park.

==Culture==
Since 1930, Lombard has hosted an annual Lilac Festival and parade in May. &quot;Lilac Time in Lombard,&quot; is a 16-day festival ending in mid-May. It starts with the Lilac Queen coronation and her court. Many lilac themed events take place, including a formal ball, concerts, wine and beer tasting in the park, a Mothers&#x27; Day Brunch, an arts and crafts fair, and tours of the park. The grand finale is Lombard&#x27;s Lilac Festival Parade. The first Lilac Princess in 1930 was Adeline Fleege.

There is a farmers market held in downtown Lombard once a week from May to October every year. 

There is a food cooperative slated to open sometime in 2024 in town. 

==Education==
Lombard&#x27;s high schools (9-12) belong to Glenbard Township High School District 87. They are shared with the neighboring town of Glen Ellyn, thus the creation of the portmanteau word &quot;Glenbard&quot;. Lombard&#x27;s elementary and middle schools (K-8) belong to Lombard School District 44 or DuPage School District 45.

By 1832, over 100 residents lived in Naper&#x27;s Settlement. In 1839, after DuPage County was split from Cook County, Naperville became the county seat, which it remained until 1868. Beginning in the 1960s, Naperville experienced a significant population increase as a result of Chicago&#x27;s urban sprawl.

Naperville is home to Moser Tower and Millennium Carillon, one of the world&#x27;s four largest carillons. It is also home to an extensive parks and forest preserve network, including Centennial Beach. The city has two school districts, 203 and 204. Naperville&#x27;s largest employer is Edward Hospital with 4,500 employees. Naperville has a train station served by Amtrak and Metra.

==History==
Before any settlement, Naperville was home to Native American tribes. In 1641, the first European contact with Native Americans in Illinois was made with members of the Iliniwek tribe. The Iliniwek was the predominant tribe throughout Illinois at the time. They were later forced off the land by the Potawatomi tribe. The Potawatomi inhabited Naperville when the first settlers arrived. There was a major Potawatomi village at the present site of downtown Naperville, reached from Chicago by a trail that became Ogden Avenue. A minor village was near where Bailey Hobson later built his mill in 1834. Bailey Hobson is credited as the first white settler in Naperville; he built a cabin across the DuPage River&#x27;s West Branch from the mill in 1830, and built his home there in 1835. 

In 1831, Joseph Naper arrived at the west bank of the DuPage River with his family and friends to found what would be known as Naper&#x27;s Settlement. Among those original settlers were Naper&#x27;s wife, his brother and his wife, his sister and her husband John Murray, and his mother. Their arrival followed a nearly two-month voyage from Ashtabula County, Ohio, in the Naper brothers&#x27; schooner, the &quot;Telegraph&quot;.

By 1832, over 100 settlers had arrived at Naper&#x27;s Settlement. After the news of the Indian Creek massacre during the Black Hawk War, these settlers were temporarily displaced to Fort Dearborn for protection from an anticipated attack by the Sauk tribe. Fort Payne was built at Naper&#x27;s Settlement, the settlers returned and the attack never materialized. The Pre-Emption House was constructed in 1834, as the Settlement became a stagecoach stop on the road from Chicago to Galena. The Pre-Emption House was the first hotel in DuPage county. After DuPage County was split from Cook County in 1839, Naper&#x27;s Settlement became the DuPage county seat. In 1843, the Illinois General assembly passed an act to incorporate the Naperville Cemetery Association. In 1855, Sybil Dunbar came to Naperville as its first recorded black female resident; she died in 1868 and was buried in Naperville Cemetery.

Naper&#x27;s Settlement was incorporated as the Village of Naperville in 1857, with a population of 2,000. The county seat distinction was lost in 1868 to Wheaton. On August 5, 1873, a train crashed on the CB&amp;Q tracks about east of Naperville. Conductor Williams, who was operating a passenger train, was informed of a freight train occupying the line, but for some reason increased his speed, and upon rounding a curve, ran into a freight caboose. A conductor sitting in the caboose and a cattle drover were instantly killed. The passenger train fireman and engineer jumped out of the locomotive just in time to save their lives.
In 1887, Peter Edward Kroehler established the Kroehler Manufacturing Company&#x27;s factory in Naperville along the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy tracks. In 1890, reincorporation as a city occurred.

After Professor James Nichols donated $10,000, Nichols Library was built and dedicated in 1898. In January 1907, Edward Sanatorium (now Edward Hospital) was opened by Eudora Hull Spalding. It used the &quot;open air&quot; treatment for tuberculosis patients. In 1908, the Chicago YMCA stated that Naperville was too small for its own YMCA building, but Peter Kroehler led a campaign to build one. In January 1910, Kroehler was the mayor of Naperville and its richest resident, but rumors in Naperville relating to a relationship between him and his stenographer caused him to resign as mayor. After his resignation, he retreated to his Binghamton, New York factory. The YMCA was opened on March 26, 1911, and included the first swimming pool in DuPage County. In February 1920, Edward Sanatorium burned to the ground and cost $500,000 to rebuild.

On April 26, 1946, Naperville was the site of a train disaster. Two Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad trains collided &quot;head to tail&quot; on a single track just west of the Loomis Street grade crossing. The accident killed 45 and injured approximately 127 passengers and/or crew members. In the 1950s, the city limits were about six square miles, but by 1960, the city had its single largest year in geographical expansion in Naperville&#x27;s history with over 1,500 acres annexed.

In 1955, Edward Sanatorium was converted into a general hospital.

A predominantly rural community for most of its existence, Naperville experienced a population explosion beginning in the 1960s and continuing into the 1980s and 1990s. Throughout the 1980s and &#x27;90s, the city&#x27;s population tripled.

In 1996, Naperville was the site of a flood that also affected the majority of northeastern Illinois. Naperville received 14 inches of rain in less than 24 hours, and DuPage County was declared a disaster zone. The estimated damages were over $30 million.

The YMCA in Downtown Naperville was announced to close in May 2020 after 109 years of operation, due to economic difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

On June 20, 2021, an EF3 tornado tore through southeast Naperville, uprooting trees, injuring eight people, and damaging 231 homes.

==Geography==

According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Naperville has a total area of , of which (or 98.52%) is land and (or 1.48%) is water.

Parts of Naperville drain to the West Branch of the DuPage River in DuPage County. The Forest Preserve District ownership of a large amount of property along the West Branch has minimized development in floodplains and has helped reduce the damage from overbank flooding that has occurred in the county&#x27;s more developed watersheds. The DuPage River Trail also runs along the DuPage River, which serves bikes and pedestrians. Naperville was primarily flat prairie before its settlement. Its main geographic anomalies are manmade hills, such as the Greene Valley Hill, a former garbage dump.

Naperville has had two major floods, one in 1996 and one in 2013.

Naperville is in six townships and two counties. In DuPage County, the northwest portion is in Winfield Township, the northeast portion in Milton Township, the west-central portion in Naperville Township, and the east-central portion in Lisle Township.

In Will County, the southwest portion is in Wheatland Township, and the southeast portion in DuPage Township. The largest number of Naperville residents live in Lisle Township, followed by Naperville Township.

Naperville&#x27;s municipal boundaries are cut in noticeably by many places. In the west, Springbrook Prairie, a forest preserve run by The Forest Preserve District of DuPage County, is a major enclave. In the southwest, the Tamarack neighborhood is a major unincorporated enclave. In the north, McDowell Grove Forest Preserve and various office complexes around Diehl Road form a major enclave into the boundary.

<text>Villa Park is a village in DuPage County, Illinois, United States, within the Chicago metropolitan area. The population as of the 2020 Census was 21,113. 

== History ==
When Ovaltine established its factory, it needed a way to make sure that its employees could get to and from work safely regardless of the weather, terrain or other issues. Villa Park was built originally for that reason, as well as for a convenient train stop.

Following the construction of a subdivision called Villa Park in 1908, and another called Ardmore in 1910 by the real estate firm Ballard &amp; Pottinger, Villa Park was incorporated in 1914 by uniting the two subdivisions of 300 people. The first village president, William H. Calhoun, was elected on September 12, 1914. Although the merged town was originally named after the Ardmore subdivision, the community changed its name to Villa Park in 1917. Villa Park was one of a number of suburbs directly west of downtown Chicago that flourished as a result of the electric interurban line, the Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad. The railroad ran from the Chicago Loop, directly west to Wheaton, Illinois, where it then split into two lines, one traveling southwest to Aurora and the other northwest to Elgin. Two small commercial areas developed, one around the Villa Avenue station and the other around the Ardmore Avenue station. In 1957, the CA&amp;E ceased to carry passengers because of a dramatic drop in ridership from the loss of a one-seat ride by the construction of the Eisenhower Expressway (I-290) and the general increase in use of personal automobiles. The right-of-way was eventually cleaned up and developed into a hiking and bicycling trail known as the Illinois Prairie Path. The Ardmore Station is now home to the Chamber of Commerce, and the Villa Avenue Station houses the Villa Park Historical Society.

Villa Park was home to the Ovaltine chocolate factory until it closed in 1988. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 as building #86003781. National Register of Historic Places - Illinois (IL), Du Page County It has since been converted into loft apartments.

Many of the residents are of Eastern European heritage, including Polish, Czech, and Russian. There is also a significant Hispanic heritage.

A sizeable Muslim immigrant community began to gather in the area in the 1980s and 1990s and established the Islamic Foundation School in 1986.

In October 2015, the Villa Park Public Library evaluated the library&#x27;s future needs and proposed the most effective solutions to address issues with the Library&#x27;s 1969 building. The Library Board and Staff developed a renovation and expansion plan that resulted in a completely renovated, expanded library facility. Construction of the project occurred in multiple phases and was completed in October 2019.

==Government==
Villa Park has a manager-council government, who is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the town. The manager position is appointed by the Village Board of Trustees. The village is governed by the Village President and six trustees, comprising the Village Board. The six trustees and the village clerk are elected on a rotating basis every two years so that not all the trustees are up for re-election at the same time. A list of elected officials currently holding office can be found on the Village&#x27;s website at invillapark.com.

Advising the Village Board on various issues are numerous commissions, composed of local residents appointed to the posts.

<text>Warrenville is a city in DuPage County, Illinois, United States. The population was 13,553 at the 2020 census. Warrenville is a far west suburb of Chicago on the DuPage River. It is part of the Illinois Technology and Research Corridor, and is just north of I-88.

==History==
Warrenville was founded in 1833 when Julius Warren and his family moved west from New York to seek a fresh start from a failing gristmill and distillery. Daniel Warren, Julius&#x27; father, claimed land at what is now McDowell Woods and Julius claimed land at what is now the Warrenville Grove Forest Preserve. The first major establishment, an inn and tavern, was built in 1838 by Julius Warren himself, as the family was skilled in timber and grain. The inn still stands today and was renovated in 2002.

The town quickly blossomed with two mills and a plank road connecting it with Naperville and Winfield, on which Julius operated a stagecoach line. The town failed at its bid to have the railroad come through the town. However, in 1902, the Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad came through town, which lasted until the late 1950s.

With a population of 4,000, Warrenville was finally incorporated as a city in 1967, following six unsuccessful attempts. The 1970s and 1980s brought westward expansion from the city of Chicago, causing the small farming community&#x27;s population to nearly double to 7,800.

The subdivisions are called Summerlakes and Fox Hollow. Other notable subdivisions of Warrenville include Warrenville Lakes, Timber Creek, Saddle Ridge, Thornwilde, Edgebrook, River Oaks, and Maple Hill.

Warrenville is a part of Community Unit School District 200, and shares 20 schools with Wheaton. Residents of Warrenville attend Bower or Johnson elementary school, Hubble Middle School, and Wheaton Warrenville South High School. Wheaton Warrenville South High School is located in Wheaton. Until 2009, Hubble was also located in Wheaton; however, in time for the 2009–2010 school year, a new Hubble was opened in Warrenville, and the new building is one of a very few schools to meet the LEED certification standards for energy-efficient design. Some children from all over Chicagoland attend Four Winds Waldorf School, a private PreK-8 school in Warrenville.

===Library===
In the 1950s, the library was housed in in the Community Building and was essentially a volunteer library filled with donated materials. Ten years later, the library closed due to a lack of volunteers and funding. The Warrenville Public Library District was formed by a referendum held in February 1979 with the citizens approving a 15-cent rate for library services. In 1986, voters approved another 15-cent tax rate increase to build and operate a facility on Stafford Place. In September 2003, a large addition and renovation project which tripled the size of the facility was completed. The building was made possible by the City of Warrenville TIF funds. The Warrenville Public Library District is a member of the DuPage Library System.

<doc id="111133" wikidata="Q2625806" url="?curid=111133" title="Wayne, Illinois">
<text>Wayne is a village in DuPage and Kane counties, Illinois, United States. The eastern portion, in DuPage County, is in Wayne Township, while the western portion, in Kane County, is in St. Charles Township. The population was 2,286 as of the 2020 census.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, Wayne was a prominent center of horse breeding and farming research. The community, situated in a small, rural valley, was known for breeding French Percheron horses, a draught horse similar to a Clydesdale. Wayne was founded in the 1800s at the same time as the similarly named Wayne Center. Wayne Center was located on Army Trail Road at DuPage River crossing and no longer exists. &quot;Downtown&quot; Wayne was originally a railroad outpost built along Glos Street and Army Trail Road. The village is much smaller than the cities that surround it. This is partially due to the native Oak savanna landscape between the DuPage and Fox rivers, with Tallgrass prairies that retain a large amount of water in the spring season. The village is surrounded by these prairies on three sides, and has taken steps to maintain them in their natural state.

== History ==


Wayne was originally named &quot;Wayne Station&quot; and was named after Anthony Wayne. Wayne was incorporated in 1958. Previously, the community was administered as a private association called the &quot;Wayne Community Association&quot; with voluntary contributions funding village services including police.

Since World War II, Wayne has grown steadily, adding subdivisions near Illinois Route 59, off Munger Road, near Smith Road, near Dunham Castle at Army Trail Road, along Powis Road, and filling in throughout the Village. For work, residents are primarily commuters to Chicago via railroad stations in Geneva, Bartlett, or West Chicago or drive to Chicago or other suburbs particularly in Kane, DuPage, Lake, Cook, or McHenry County.

In October 2007, the historic Chicago and Northwestern railway station was relocated from Dunham Castle to the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad (now Union Pacific) tracks at Army Trail Road. The station was originally at that location, but moved to Dunham Castle during the 1940s or 1950s; the old station was converted to a horse stable. Through grants and contributions from Dunham Castle&#x27;s owners, the station was moved back to its original location and is currently being restored. This building is locally called &quot;The Depot&quot;. Additional railroad buildings were relocated to private property in the Village including one station building about ½ mile west of Munger Road on Army Trail Road.

===Oaklawn Farm and Dunham Castle===
Wayne&#x27;s primary landmark is the Dunham Castle, originally built between 1878 and 1882. The stone structure, complete with turret, was inspired by a Norman castle and was built by one of Wayne&#x27;s first pioneers, Mark Dunham, a Percheron horse breeder. Assisting Mark in the design was architect Smith Hoag of Elgin, Illinois.

Mark Dunham&#x27;s horse farm, Oaklawn Farm, founded in Wayne in 1866, was one of the earliest Percheron breeding farms in the U.S.; Dunham is known as the “Father of the Percheron in North America”. During the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, a train from Chicago to Wayne brought guests to see the Percheron horses at the farm. Those that made the trip included Cyrus McCormick, George Pullman, and the Duke of Veragua.

At the height of the Percheron business, Dunham built a house, now called Dunham Castle, near the farm, on the northwest corner of Army Trail Road and Dunham Road. The Dunhams-based the idea for the design of their new home on that of French chateaux. The building, of brick, and stone, with different colored slate roofing, stands surrounded by woods, gardens, and a gently sloping lawn. The interior has parquet floors, statues, tapestries, and copies of fine, French artwork.

In 1899, Wirth Dunham inherited Dunham Castle. He died in 1931. In 1953, Dunham Castle was converted into four spacious apartments. No interior alterations were made that affected the structure. Between 1953 and 1976 there were several owners. In 1976, the Castle was sold to the Griffins family, who looked into making the house a museum, professional office, or private dining club. In 1976, the house was put up for sale.

The castle has been rarely open to public tours, and for charity fund raisers. The house is again privately owned, having been sold in October 2013 and in early 2016 started extensive renovation by its private owner with completion expected in 2021.

When Marc Dunham finished the construction of Dunham Castle, and made it his primary residence, the original Dunham home evolved into an inn and sales pavilion for the Dunham family&#x27;s Oaklawn Farm. However, Percheron horse demand declined steadily as gas-powered cars, trucks, and farm implements grew in popularity, finally making Percherons a novelty or parade horse, and Oaklawn Farm ceased operation as a commercial enterprise. The offices of Dunham&#x27;s farm, then popularly known as the “Inn”, are well-preserved, now home to Wayne&#x27;s only dining establishment and social club, the Dunham Woods Riding Club.

===Dunham Woods Riding Club===
The Dunham Woods Riding Club was founded in 1934 by a group of Wayne and Geneva residents who leased the original Dunham family home. A fire destroyed the original old coach house in 1950 and the proceeds of the insurance were utilized by the club to purchase the Inn, the Lower Barn, swimming pool, tennis courts, and surrounding land. The Gray Room ballroom, Formal Dining Room and a new kitchen were added in 1957.

In 1961, the Wayne-DuPage Hunt was instrumental in purchasing more land from Dunham&#x27;s Inc., including the Kennels and Upper Barn. This purchase was made in the name of the Dunham Woods Riding Club. Additional land was purchased in 1975, which included the outdoor riding rings, indoor riding ring, outside cross-country course, tenant house, and new pole barn all of which are leased to the Hunt by the club.

In 1979, the four corners comprising the intersection of Army Trail and Dunham Roads, The Dunham Woods Riding Club and Dunham Castle, together with the additional surrounding land and outbuildings were accepted into the National Register of Historic Places.
==Equestrian traditions==
The Village of Wayne is committed to preserving its equestrian nature and reputation. The village has miles of equestrian paths, as well as dozens of horse farms, riding centers, and boarding stables. The Wayne-DuPage Hunt, founded in the 1920s, is one of only two fox hunt groups continuing to hunt within metro Chicago, the other being the Mill Creek Hunt in far north Wadsworth. Wayne-DuPage is a drag hunt, not chasing live foxes. The hunt involves kennels for some 60 fox hounds and a membership list of 150, though 80 riders represent a good turnout on a crisp fall weekend. Traditions such as the stirrup cup, sherry or brandy served at the start or finish, and the hunt breakfast, refreshments served at the end, have been preserved. The Wayne-DuPage Hunt Pony Club is a related organization for teaching young people riding, training and horse care.

== Housing ==
Housing in the Village of Wayne varies from small bungalows to multimillion-dollar estates. There are several subdivisions within the Village with house size and value more or less uniform within a given subdivision. Most subdivisions have one to zoning. Much of the modern housing has been built since the 1970s. Some houses in the Village date to the late 19th century. In DuPage County, a minimum of is needed to keep horses. In Kane County, property outside of subdivisions must be at least . A property with at least in either county is locally called &quot;zoned horses&quot; with one horse allowed per acre. Outbuildings are permitted but must follow Village rules that restrict usage generally to horse stables. Architecture varies within the Village but there are several &quot;New England&quot; style homes.

==Flag Day==
Residents and guests celebrate Flag Day in June each year with a parade and picnic on the Sunday nearest June 14. This parade often features more participants than spectators. The parade begins at Railroad Street at Army Trail Road and is open to all. The parade ends at the Little Home Church 1025¼ feet east. Wayne residents and guests in the church courtyard eat donated cakes and bring picnics. A Jazz band serenades the guests. A Wayne Citizen of the Year, honored for contributions to the village, is traditionally announced at this event. This event is run by the Wayne Community Association in conjunction with the Village of Wayne. Until 2005 this event served as the annual meeting of the Wayne Community Association.
== Wayne Day and other gatherings ==
Residents and guests celebrate Wayne Day around the first Saturday in October each year in the fields east of the Dunham Club with a kite flying, picnic, and evening bonfire. Started around 1997, this annual event highlights community organizations, local politicians, and historic exhibits. This event is run by community organizations in conjunction with the Village of Wayne. The 2009 event commemorated the 175th anniversary of the founding of Wayne.

In addition, other events have been held to raise funds for the Wayne Police Department, including a 2017 &quot;Wayne Wine and Horse Fest&quot; fundraising event that drew over 1,200 area people and raised over $42,000 for the Wayne Police Department. Subsequent &quot;Wayne Wine and Horse Fest&quot; events have been held and raised additional funding for the Wayne Police Department.

The Village of Wayne started hosting an annual Christmas Tree lighting by the Old Depot building in 2021.

== Pratt’s Wayne Woods ==

Wayne contains a large forest preserve. Pratt&#x27;s Wayne Woods is the largest forest preserve in DuPage County. Located in the county&#x27;s northwest corner, the preserve&#x27;s combine with Illinois Department of Natural Resource land adjacent on the north to form a continuous stretch of land, a scarce resource in a growing urban area. The savannas, marshes, meadows and wetlands of Pratt&#x27;s Wayne Woods offer a myriad of nature-loving opportunities and recreational excursions. The preserve&#x27;s Brewster Creek area is the site of a major wetland restoration program.

The area now known as Pratt&#x27;s Wayne Woods first took form in 1965 with a donation of by the state of Illinois. Thanks to the efforts of George Pratt, a township supervisor and a preserve commissioner during the 1960s and 1970s, the Forest Preserve District began to purchase additional lands that comprise Pratt&#x27;s Wayne Woods today.

The first private land owner of this area was Mark Wentworth Fletcher, a surveyor who made his living in Geneva, Dundee, Elgin, St. Charles and Wayne. Fletcher purchased from the federal government on February 18, 1846, and built a farmhouse along Dunham Road.

After Fletcher&#x27;s death in 1900, the land changed ownership a few times before Mark Morton purchased it in 1926. One of the founders of the Morton Salt Company, Morton excavated the farm&#x27;s southwest corner for sand and gravel. Land that was not used in the mineral operations was farmed for grain and corn up until a few years before Morton&#x27;s death in 1951.

The land was later purchased by Franz Palm, who transformed the area into a sportsman&#x27;s hunting and fishing lodge. The Palm family had originally intended their park to be their retirement place; however, the state of Illinois had other plans. The state purchased the original with the intention of creating a state park. Once this idea was abandoned, George Pratt convinced the District to purchase the quarry area for a forest preserve. In 1974, Pratt expanded the preserve by selling his adjacent Maple Spring Farm to the District.

Since the early 20th century, the complex of wetlands in Pratt&#x27;s Wayne Woods’ Brewster Creek area have been artificially drained by a system of buried clay pipes. The Forest Preserve District is now removing these drain tiles to restore this vital habitat, which over the years has become home to several threatened and endangered plant and animal species.

In 1990, plans to form DuPage County&#x27;s only state park were revived when the state and the Forest Preserve District purchased more than in the area of Pratt&#x27;s Wayne Woods for that purpose. James &quot;Pate&quot; Philip State Park is located just north of Pratt&#x27;s Wayne Woods. A 24,000 square foot (2,200 m2) visitors center that also houses the Illinois Department of Natural Resources’ Region 2 headquarters opened in April 2003.

In 2004, an area east of Honey Hill Road and south of Army Trail Road was purchased by the DuPage Forest Preserve District from Oliver-Hoffman Corporation. This area, still under park development by Dupage Forest Preserve in 2016, is known as Dunham Woods and is adjacent to portions of Pratts Wayne Woods in its southeast section.

<text>West Chicago is a city in DuPage County, Illinois, United States. The population was 25,614 at the 2020 census. It was formerly named Junction and later Turner Junction, after its founder, John Bice Turner, president of the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad (G&amp;CU) in 1855. The city was initially established around the first junction of railroad lines in Illinois, and today is still served by the Metra service via West Chicago station.

==History==

Erastus Gary, of Pomfret, Connecticut, homesteaded on the banks of the DuPage River, just south of West Chicago&#x27;s present day city limits in the 1830s. His son became &quot;Judge&quot; Elbert Henry Gary, the first CEO of America&#x27;s first billion-dollar corporation, U.S. Steel, and for whom Gary, Indiana, is named. Gary also helped bring brothers Jesse and Warren Wheaton, founders of nearby Wheaton, Illinois, the DuPage County seat, from Connecticut to the Midwest. A pioneer cemetery on the old &quot;Gary Homestead&quot;, where a sawmill had been built by the Garys, just north of Gary&#x27;s Mill Road, and north of its terminus at Illinois Route 59, was built over with apartment buildings in the 1960s.

In 1849, the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad (predecessor of the C&amp;NW) reached the site of present-day West Chicago, then continued northwest to Elgin. In 1850, the Aurora Branch Railroad (predecessor of the CB&amp;Q) built southwest, making America&#x27;s first railroad junction point west of Chicago. In 1854, the G&amp;CURR opened the “Dixon Air Line” branch West thru Geneva.

Because of the number of trains passing through town, water and fuel facilities for locomotives and a roundhouse were built here, as well as an early eating-house and hotel for travelers. As a result, a number of new employees and their families located to this community. The original settlers were primarily English and Irish, with Germans arriving in the 1860s and Mexican immigrants by the 1910s. John B. Turner, president of the G&amp;CU and a resident of Chicago, owned several acres of land in what is now the center of town. As more people settled in Junction, Turner recognized the chance to make a profit by platting his land and selling off lots. He therefore recorded the community&#x27;s first plat in 1855 under the name of &quot;Town of Junction&quot;.

The community continued its growth, although the one-room schoolhouse built a mile outside town in 1835 would become the state&#x27;s last surviving one-room schoolhouse when it closed in 1991. Meanwhile, in 1857, Dr. Joseph McConnell and his wife Mary platted a second portion of town just north of John B. Turner&#x27;s plat. They recorded their plat as the &quot;Town of Turner&quot; in honor of the railroad president. These two “towns” became informally known as Turner Junction.

By 1873, the community had taken on a substantial and permanent character, so the residents incorporated as the &quot;Village of Turner&quot;. In 1888, a new railroad, the Elgin, Joliet &amp; Eastern, built a freight line through town. It offered free factory sites for any industry willing to locate along its right-of-way. As part of the effort to attract industry, the community changed its name in 1896 to the &quot;Village of West Chicago&quot;. Area businessmen, particularly Charles Bolles, reasoned that the new name sounded more cosmopolitan, and would help draw prospective factory owners.

As industry located in West Chicago and new jobs opened up, the population increased. At the turn of the century, West Chicago was number two in population in DuPage County, behind Hinsdale. By 1910, the population was 2,378 and several new industries had located here, including the Borden&#x27;s milk condensing plant, the Turner Cabinet Company and the Turner Brick Company. The community continues to attract quality business and residential development that contributes to the culturally diverse community that exists today.

In 1909, one more railroad came to West Chicago. The Chicago, Wheaton and Western Railway, a lightly built interurban electric railway, came in from the east, running down the middle of Junction and Depot (now both Main) streets, then curved back west toward Geneva. Soon bought by the Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad, the “country trolley” was lightly used, and abandoned in 1937. The right of way is now the Geneva Spur of the Illinois Prairie Path.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the city received a nuclear-waste contamination scare. Harmful waste from the Rare Earths Facility had been spread around the community since the 1930s, when the Lindsay Light and Chemical Company built a plant. Reed-Keppler Park was built on top of a landfill that had received some waste from the plant. Kerr-McGee, which had bought the facility in 1967 and operated it until 1973, settled with the city and cleaned up the waste.

The movie &quot;Reach the Rock&quot;, written by John Hughes, was filmed in downtown West Chicago in 1998.

<text>Westmont is a village in DuPage County, Illinois, United States. It is a southwest suburb of Chicago.

== History ==
The area known as Westmont earlier had been inhabited by the Potawatami. After several failed attempts by the U.S. government to persuade the Native Americans to move from the area, in 1833 they agreed under coercion to vacate their land for a nominal payment.

The development of the Illinois-Michigan Canal, authorized by the State of Illinois in the 1820s but delayed in construction until the 1830s, contributed to Westmont&#x27;s early growth. Many of the workers turned to farming when the economic panic of 1837 halted canal construction; agriculture became the major occupation with produce sold in nearby Chicago. The area around Westmont became one of the most prosperous sections of the state.

In order to transport agricultural products into the city of Chicago, construction of a plank road from Chicago began in 1840. The path traversed the nine-mile (14 km) swamp between Chicago and the area that later became Westmont; it reached Naperville by 1851. Today, this path is known as Ogden Avenue (U.S. Route 34).

The plank road soon became inadequate; in 1858, local incorporated towns and villages petitioned the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad to build a branch line from Aurora to Chicago that would pass through their towns. The railroad line was approved, with the first train in 1864. &quot;Gregg&#x27;s Milk Station,&quot; from which Westmont developed, was a stop to load agricultural and dairy products. The town transitioned gradually from an agricultural community to a commuter community, with the early growth and development centered around the railroad station.

In the early 1900s, plats for the Village of Westmont were laid out and roads were dedicated; incorporation was decided by a vote of 41-28 in 1921. Westmont was officially incorporated on November 4, 1921; Vince Pastor served as the first president of the Village Board.

Westmont High School opened in 1974, and Westmont Public Library in 1993.

<text>Wheaton is a city in and the county seat of DuPage County, Illinois, United States. It is located in Milton and Winfield Townships, approximately west of Chicago. As of the 2020 census, Wheaton&#x27;s population was 53,970, making it the 27th-most populous municipality in the state.

==History==
===Founding===
The city dates its founding to the period between 1831 and 1837, following the Indian Removal Act, when Erastus Gary laid claim to of land near present-day Warrenville. The Wheaton brothers arrived from Connecticut, and in 1837, Warren L. Wheaton laid claim to of land in the center of town. Jesse Wheaton later made claim to of land just west of Warren&#x27;s. It was not long before other settlers from New England joined them in the community. In 1848, they gave the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad of right-of-way, upon which railroad officials named the depot Wheaton. In 1850, ten blocks of land were platted and anyone who was willing to build immediately was granted free land. In 1853, the lots were surveyed and a formal plat for the community was filed with the county. The community was then incorporated as a village on February 24, 1859, with Warren serving as its first President. The village was later incorporated as a city on April 24, 1890, when the first mayor of the city was selected, Judge Elbert Gary, son of Erastus Gary and founder of Gary, Indiana.

===Establishment as county seat===
In 1857, the Illinois state legislature authorized an election to be held to decide the question of whether the DuPage county seat should remain in Naperville or be moved to the more centrally located Wheaton, which was on the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad. Naperville won the election by a vote of 1,542 to 762. Hostility between the two towns continued for the next decade and another election was held in 1867, in which Wheaton narrowly won by a vote of 1,686 to 1,635. At a cost of $20,000, the City of Wheaton quickly built a courthouse to house a courtroom, county offices, and a county jail. The building was dedicated on July 4, 1868.

However, animosity between the two towns continued, and in 1868, as records were moved from the old Naperville courthouse to the new courthouse in Wheaton, Naperville refused to turn over the remaining county records, prompting a band of Civil War veterans from Wheaton to conduct what came to be known as the &quot;Midnight Raid&quot; on the Naperville courthouse. As Wheatonites fled back on Wheaton-Naperville Road, Napervillians were able to secure some of the last remaining records, which were then taken to the Cook County Recorder in Chicago for safekeeping. During this time, Naperville was mounting a lawsuit against Wheaton accusing election judges of leaving their posts for lunch during the vote when duplicate ballot stuffing allegedly occurred. As the courts deliberated the fate of the county seat, the records were destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Shortly thereafter, Wheaton was officially proclaimed the county seat.
As demand for space increased, the courthouse was rebuilt in 1887 at a cost of $69,390, modeled after the courthouse in Aledo. This structure was used for the next 94 years until the county&#x27;s rapid growth prompted the building of a brand new complex. The old courthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and was formerly used by National Louis University until National Louis moved to Lisle in 2004. It is currently being developed into luxury condominiums.

On November 2, 1990, the courthouse moved to a building about west in a new complex at the corner of County Farm Road and Manchester Road. It was built at a cost of $52,500,000 and includes a judicial building. In 1992, the county sued the architect and contractor for $4 million after several employees became ill from the ventilation system. In the end, however, the county received only $120,000 for minor repairs and the jury sided with the defendants, finding that the alleged problems were caused, primarily, by the county&#x27;s negligent operation and maintenance of the ventilation system.

===Expansion===
Wheaton has rapidly expanded since the 1950s, although population growth has slowed since the early 1990s, as the city has become increasingly landlocked. Downtown lost much business after the county courthouse facility moved west in 1990, but in the decade since, the downtown has seen a renaissance of sorts, with the creation of several significant condominium and business developments. One of the most recognizable landmarks of the city is Wheaton Center, a 758-unit apartment complex on in downtown Wheaton. The six building complex includes two twenty-story high-rise buildings built in 1975.

In 1887, Wheaton prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages, a ban which lasted until 1985 and applied to all supermarkets, convenience stores, restaurants, and other establishments.

===Business districts===
Wheaton boasts a vibrant downtown with many restaurants, shops and services. The Downtown Wheaton Association hosts many events throughout the year to promote local businesses, including The French Market, The Chili Cookoff, Vintage Rides, Boo-palooza (Downtown Wheaton Trick-or-Treat), A Dickens of a Christmas, Wheaton Wedding Walk and Wheaton&#x27;s Wine &amp; Cultural Arts Festival.

Downtown Wheaton is also home to perhaps one of the narrowest stores in the Chicago area. The Little Popcorn Store on Front Street was formerly an alley between two buildings, and features the exposed brick walls of its neighbors. The store has been around since the 1920s and sells candy for as little as 1¢ apiece, and fresh popcorn.

Other shopping districts in Wheaton include Danada Square West, and Danada Square East, named after Dan and Ada Rice, located on the north side of Illinois Route 56 (Butterfield Road), on the west and east side of Naperville Road.

==Arts and culture==
===Fairgrounds===
Wheaton is home to the DuPage County Fairgrounds. Organized in 1954, the DuPage County Fair Association hosts the annual DuPage County Fair in late July. The fair annually attracts major entertainers, such as Ashlee Simpson, Plain White T&#x27;s (2007), Travis Tritt, Jesse McCartney, Jars of Clay, Corbin Bleu (2008), The Academy Is..., The Original Wailers (2009), and Danny Gokey (2010).

===Theater===
Wheaton is also home to the historic Grand Theater, built in 1925. In recent years, the theater and volunteers undertook a restoration to its original state, complete with a lighted dome ceiling dotted with stars, and a newly painted floor. It celebrated its grand reopening on May 11, 2002, and on August 25, 2005, the theater was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. There was a sense of growing pessimism that the theater would ever be restored, due to lack of progress and funds. However, there was cause for hope when on January 23, 2010, when many cast members of the off-Broadway show &quot;Jersey Boys&quot; raised approximately $50,000 for restoration.

On July 10, 2010, the Grand Theater Corp. surrendered the deed to the building, to Suburban Bank and Trust Co, due in part to being delinquent on a $800,000 loan, carried by Suburban Bank and Trust Co.

On November 30, 2012, Jim Atten bought the building, intending to reopen it soon. Since then he has been repairing the property and leading the effort to remove temporary structures within the theater. He has worked closely with an architect and the city staff as the effort progresses. According to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; newspaper, it will take an estimated $5 million to get the theater up and running again.

===Public library===

The Wheaton Public Library is frequently ranked as one of the top ten libraries in the nation compared to other libraries serving similarly sized populations.

===Religious institutions===
Wheaton has forty-five churches located within city limits and an additional thirty places of worship in the outlying unincorporated areas, representing nearly forty religious denominations. The Genius Edition of &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; states that Wheaton has the &quot;second most churches per capita in America.&quot;

Built in 1926, the national headquarters of the Theosophical Society in America is located on a estate on the north side of Wheaton.

Originally an unincorporated area of nearby Darien, Willowbrook grew from the Ridgemoor subdivision. It was named after a Grove of Willows along a local creek, which flows into Waterfall Glen. It was incorporated as a village in 1960 Construction of U.S. Route 66 along Willowbrook&#x27;s south edge led to the development of several new gas stations and restaurants. In 1946, Ervin &quot;Irv&quot; Kolarik opened Dell Rhea&#x27;s Chicken Basket on Route 66. The restaurant became a staple in the community. It continues to operate as one of the last surviving stops on Route 66 in Illinois. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In the 1980&#x27;s, new development began along IL-83 and I-55 as the village population continued to grow. In 1990, a swampy pond along Route 83, was cleaned up and designated as &quot;Willow Pond&quot;.

A local facility, Sterigenics International, Inc., uses a &#x27;probable carcinogen&#x27; called Ethylene Oxide to sterilize medical equipment. According to the EPA fact sheet, &#x27;Long-term exposure to ethylene oxide can irritate the eyes, skin, nose, throat, and lungs, and harm the brain and nervous system (causing effects such as headaches, memory loss, numbness). Studies show that breathing air containing elevated ethylene oxide levels over many years increases the risk of some types of cancers, including cancers of the white blood cells (such as non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, myeloma and lymphocytic leukemia); and breast cancer in females.&#x27; 
On September 30, 2019, Sterigenics announced the closing of the Willowbrook facility eliminating key source of cancer causing chemical.

<text>Winfield is an incorporated village located in Milton and Winfield Townships, DuPage County, Illinois, United States. The DuPage River headwaters are located directly to the north, and the river runs through the village. The population was 9,835 at the 2020 census, and was estimated to be 10,046 in 2022.

Winfield is the location of Central DuPage Hospital, one of the largest hospitals in the Chicago suburbs. Winfield station on the Union Pacific West Line provides commuter rail service to Chicago. Winfield is considered among the safest towns in Illinois.

==History==
Winfield originally tried to become an incorporated village in 1884 under the town name &#x27;Frederick Park&#x27;. However, the motion was denied as the town did not have 300 residents as was required for incorporation. When the village was finally incorporated in 1921, the town had a population of 310 people.

The earliest settlers, Erastus and Jude P. Gary, came to Winfield in 1832. Winfield was originally known as Gary&#x27;s Mill after these early settlers, and later, Fredericksburg, owing to a significant German-speaking population. Before 1850, most Winfield residents were migrants from New England; however, by 1860, half of the residents were from Germany and Alsace-Lorraine. Winfield retained a community of German-speaking farmers until the 1920s. In the late 1800s, the settlement&#x27;s name was changed again to Winfield after the war hero Winfield Scott.

Winfield was home to one of the oldest taverns in the Chicago suburbs, John&#x27;s Restaurant and Tavern (formerly John&#x27;s Buffet), founded in 1921 by immigrant John T Karwoski. It closed its doors in December 2017. John Karwoski was instrumental in the political and economic development of Winfield, and it was his guidance and leadership that took a fledgling prairie town clinging to existence after the railroad boom went bust, and turned it into a viable and livable village. Mr Karwoski became the first Chief of the all-volunteer Winfield Volunteer Fire Company in 1935. 45 years later, his son John Karwoski II was made Chief of the expanded Winfield Fire Protection District in 1980.

Winfield was served by &quot;The Winfield Glimpses&quot; newspaper from October 1947 to October 1976. The Glimpses changed its name to the &quot;Winfield Examiner&quot; in November 1976 and ran until February 1992. A full collection of these newspapers is available on microfilm at the Winfield Public Library.

<text>Hume is a village in Shiloh and Young America townships, Edgar County, Illinois, United States. As of the 2020 census, the village population was 325.

==History==

The future site of Hume was most likely part of the Illinois Confederation in the Pre-Columbian period. White settlers of the 19th century in the area reported relationships with Kickapoo peoples.

In the early 19th century, the area of Illinois including the future site of the Village of Hume and the Young America Township was prairie and thus considered unsuitable for settlement or tillage. Land speculators bought local land from the government (known as &quot;entering land&quot;) on the hope that it would become possible to cultivate it in the near future. Large herds of cattle often grazed on the open land during this period.

In 1857, the Indiana and Illinois Airline railroad was laid out and graded, although it would be fifteen years before rails were laid. In February 1865, Elzephan W. S. Hume moved to Illinois from Boone County, Kentucky, and purchased about of land along the proposed line of the Indiana and Illinois Airline railroad. By November, he opened a farm and began cultivation. In the spring of 1873, the railroad was complete through Edgar county. In later years, the railroad was expanded to Indianapolis and was called the Indianapolis, Decatur and Springfield Railway. The railroad would change names several times before being incorporated into the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.

In 1873, E. W. S. Hume made plans for a town on his land, although no buildings existed on the planned town at that time. He also made an agreement with the railroad company to build a station for Hume, in exchange for lots of land in the new village. The names Elzephan W. S. Hume, Henry C. Moore, Thomas H. McCoughty, and H. B. Hammond appear on the original plat for the incorporation of Hume. George W. Foreman laid out the village of Hume in early November 1873 for those four men.

O. H. Rogers built the first house and the first store on the town&#x27;s plat. E. W. S. Hume was the first President of the Village and the first Postmaster. The following persons built homes or businesses in Hume during the 1870s:
* Eben Hathaway, blacksmith
* Michael Ewel, house
* W. C. Smith, house
* Dr. S. H. Bradley, physician
* Geo. W. Hughes
* Dr. D. D. Roberts
* Dr. Port Skeen, veterinary doctor
* Simeon Stark, store
* O. H. Linnabary, hotel
* Samuel Lyons, grocery

A census taken in 1879 gave a population of 270 residents, thirty short of the number required by Illinois state law to incorporate as a town. The improved drainage of prairie for farms encouraged the growth of Hume in the late 19th century. By 1890, a local newspaper named &quot;The Weekly Record&quot; was published by D. V. Bradley, son of Dr. S. H. Bradley.

In 1881, a railroad named the Danville, Olney and Ohio River Railroad passed through Hume, going north and south. It was known locally as the Chicago &amp; Ohio River line.

In 1896, the Young America Cemetery was founded by the sale of stock in the cemetery&#x27;s association.

In 1913, the Hume Manufacturing Company was founded to produce tractors of a new design. A factory was built opposite the railroad tracks from Front Street. Thirty-five tractors were built from 1913 to 1917. The Atlas Lyons Company of Indianapolis purchased the company&#x27;s stock and its assets.

==Geography==
According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Hume has a total area of , all land.

The great majority of the Village is part of Young America Township. A southern part of Hume is in Shiloh Township.

==Demographics==

==Education==

In 1870, E. W. S. Hume donated a site for a one-room school. The school was built by Peter Cockrell at the present intersection of East Street and First Street, within the village of Hume. The first teacher was Anna Grimes. In 1878, a second room was added, to form an L-shaped building.

High-school level studies began after 1880, and the school began to use overflow sites around Hume. The first brick schoolhouse was built in 1884 from bricks made in a local kiln, on the site of the present city park at the intersection of Center Street and Fourth Street.

The cornerstone for another new school was laid on July 4, 1900, across Center Street from the former schoolhouse. The School Gym was erected in 1927.

A township high school was organized in 1913, after a referendum held March 8, 1913, to form District 148, covering within Edgar County. In 1947, the consolidated school of Hume was formed, including the former Hume area schools of Baum, Dodd, Maple Grove, Bane, Gilkey, Melwood, Wyatt, and Palermo. The voters decided on July 1, 1947, to form a Community Unit District including Hume, Metcalf and Brocton.

In 1967, voters agreed to issue bonds to construct a single, central school for kindergarten through grade 12, and Shiloh School opened in August 1968.

==Religion==

Until 1875, Christians in Hume traveled to Chrisman, Illinois to attend religious ceremonies. The Christian Church was organized in 1875 by Christopher C. Boyer. J. W. Perkins was the first minister. In 1880, the congregation built a church at the corner of East and Second Streets. In 1916, the church was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. The cornerstone of the present church was laid on August 4, 1917, at the corner of Center Street and First Street.

A society of Methodists was formed in 1877, with meetings held in a schoolhouse on the northeast corner of East Street and First Street.

The Catholic Church of Hume is named St. Michael&#x27;s.

==History==
Paris was established in 1826 on land donated by Samuel Vance to be the county seat, and was incorporated as a village in 1849. The town most likely received its name from the word &quot;Paris&quot; carved into a jack-oak tree in the middle of what became the town.

Paris&#x27;s history includes the service of two brothers, Walter Booth and Newton Booth, as its mayors in the mid-1850s. Newton Booth later moved west to California, where he served as governor and a U.S. senator.

The commission form of government was adopted in 1915. In 1907, L. A. G. Shoaff bought the Centralia White Stockings and renamed them the Paris Colts. In 1908 the team was renamed the Paris Parisians. After the 1908 season the team went under. In the 1950s Paris was home to a minor-league baseball team named the Paris Lakers. A contest was held among the community to decide on a name for the team. James C. Dickey&#x27;s submission, the Paris Lakers, was chosen. The Lakers were the 1956 Midwest League Champions and were an affiliate of the Chicago Cubs.

==Transportation==

U.S. Route 150 and Illinois State Route 1 pass through Paris. Both Illinois State Route 16 and Illinois State Route 133 have Illinois State Route 1 as their eastern terminus.

<doc id="111148" wikidata="Q291321" url="?curid=111148" title="Albion, Illinois">
<text>Albion is a city in and the county seat of Edwards County, Illinois, United States. The population was 1,971 at the 2020 census. The city was named &quot;Albion&quot; after an ancient and poetic reference to the island of Great Britain.

==History==
The settlement now known as Albion was originally known to the world as &quot;Mr. Morris Birkbeck&#x27;s English Prairie&quot;, when Morris Birkbeck, an English Quaker, with co-founder George Flower (1788-1862) established the town as a utopian community in 1817. In 1818, following an irreconcilable fall-out between Birkbeck and Flower, the portion of English Prairie then settled on by Flower was given the name Albion.

In 1821, the county seat of Edwards County was moved from Palmyra to Albion, eighteen miles to the west. However, residents of the larger Mount Carmel felt their town should be the county seat. Four companies of militia marched from Mount Carmel towards Albion to seize the county documents stored in the courthouse. The situation was eventually resolved in 1824 by separating Wabash County from Edwards County at Bonpas Creek and making Mount Carmel the seat of Wabash County. The two counties are among the smallest in Illinois.

The township of Albion has a curious link with England and brewing. George Flower and Morris Birkbeck, a Quaker agriculturalist and radical, organised the purchase of 26,400 acres of land in the southern &quot;Illinois Territory,&quot; and encouraged settlers from England to come and join them. Among them was George&#x27;s father Richard Flower, an experienced brewer (who at some point taught his son about making popular beer styles of the period, including London Porter). Flower came across the Atlantic with all his remaining children.

The settlement espoused a firm abolitionist ethos, and escaped slaves from Kentucky settled in Albion, encouraged by the Flowers and other community leaders. However, these formerly enslaved people were always in danger of being kidnapped by bounty hunters aiming to return them to slavery. Around 1823-24 one such gang of eight to ten kidnapped a group of free African-American residents of Albion and headed south. They were pursued by an outraged armed party led by Richard’s youngest son, Edward. He was only eighteen years old, but his posse successfully captured the gang &quot;at the rifle&#x27;s mouth,&quot; freed the captives, and took the kidnappers to face judgment under the law.

Friends or ‘business associates’ of the original kidnappers&#x27; allies plotted to kill the young Flower or his father in revenge. According to some newspaper reports, a cousin also named Richard was tragically mistaken for Edward’s father and killed in a pre-planned argument and fight. On another occasion, a bullet was fired through a window of Richard&#x27;s house and smashed a mirror above his head. The family decided that the only safe plan was for Edward Flower to leave the country. Back in England after 1825, he decided to take up the family trade and, after a struggling start, Flower’s Brewery in Stratford-upon-Avon became one of the most famous in England, surviving as a separate company to the 1950s and as a brand to this day. Edward loved Illinois and missed his former life in America with his family. He regretted his forced departure and frequently mused about returning. During the Civil War, Flower spoke at meetings around Britain and Ireland in support of the Union, and against slavery. As a retiree, he made a six-month visit to the US with his wife Celina in 1866, after the war was over.

On June 2nd 1990, as part of the larger June 1990 Lower Ohio Valley tornado outbreak, An F4 passed through the town. As it moved through, famous footage was taken of the Tornado showing it growing several vortacies that extended out like arms.

==History==
Grayville was founded in about 1810 by the head of the Gray family, James Gray. The city became popular for its oil. Many people came to drill for oil. In the 1950s the population began to drop. Unlike other Illinois oil towns, Grayville still tends to thrive.

==Geography==
Grayville is located at (38.259146, -87.996678).

According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Grayville has a total area of , of which (or 98.02%) is land and (or 1.98%) is water.

===Climate===
==Roads==
In Grayville, Illinois Route 130 meets Illinois Route 1, and Route 1 meets Interstate 64.

Grayville was built on the Wabash River. While it is no longer on any major rail line, it was home to a large rail bridge across the Wabash into Indiana, but sections of that bridge collapsed in January 2005 due to a major flood of the Wabash River.

In late 2005, an ethanol plant was proposed for the Grayville area, and the construction of the plant would have included rebuilding the bridge and rail lines leading to it on both the Indiana and Illinois sides of the river, but as of July 2009, neither the plant nor the bridge have been built.

The largest bridge to Indiana south of Lawrenceville, and the only Interstate link between Illinois and Indiana south of Terre Haute, the I-64 river crossing runs parallel to the collapsed rail bridge, about 1000 feet upstream.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census there were 1,550 people, 680 households, and 400 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 808 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 94.45% White, 0.32% African American, 0.06% Native American, 0.71% Asian, 0.13% Pacific Islander, 0.52% from other races, and 3.81% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.61% of the population.

There were 680 households, out of which 32.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 43.24% were married couples living together, 14.12% had a female householder with no husband present, and 41.18% were non-families. 33.97% of all households were made up of individuals, and 20.00% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.78 and the average family size was 2.24.

The city&#x27;s age distribution consisted of 22.4% under the age of 18, 7.0% from 18 to 24, 26.5% from 25 to 44, 24.1% from 45 to 64, and 20.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40.5 years. For every 100 females, there were 86.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 81.4 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $47,222, and the median income for a family was $58,333. Males had a median income of $41,522 versus $22,500 for females. The per capita income for the city was $24,233. About 14.0% of families and 20.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 29.5% of those under age 18 and 18.0% of those age 65 or over.

==The River==

Grayville had been at the northern end of a four-mile-long oxbow bend of the main channel of the Wabash River. The river changed course after a flood in 1985, with the result being that the town is now two miles from the new river channel. Bonpas Creek trickles through a portion of the former river channel, creating continued access to water for canoes, rafts, and extremely shallow-draft small boats.

<text>West Salem is a village in Edwards County, Illinois, United States. The population was 786 at the 2020 census, down from 897 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
The West Salem area was settled in the 1830s and early 1840s by Moravians primarily from Salem, North Carolina, and Hope, Indiana. Among the early settlers were Adam Hedrick and Peter Hinkle.

From 1841 to 1846 the new Moravian settlers were working with the headquarters of the southern province of the Moravian Church in Salem (Old Salem), North Carolina, in establishing a congregation. William Eberman, the Moravian pastor at Hope, Indiana, was sent to visit and preach for them in the fall of 1841. Many other settlers followed, until by 1843, more than 80 families lived within a radius of what was to become West Salem, most of them Moravians. But in 1843, it was Martin Hauser, a Moravian home missionary also from Hope, Indiana, who would be instrumental not only in starting a Moravian Church, but also in helping to establish the town. On Saturday, May 25, 1844, a meeting was held in Peter Hinkle&#x27;s barn, where heads of 15 families came forward and signed the Brotherly Agreement and Constitution that formed the new Moravian congregation. On his way home to Hope, in 1845, Hauser stopped at the federal land Office in Palestine, Illinois, to buy, in the name of the church, of land on which West Salem is presently located. He was acting as attorney-in-fact for Rev. Charles Kluge, President of the Synod of the Southern Provincial Conference of the Moravian Church of North America.

In the years that followed, the new community of West Salem began to thrive but also to experience challenges as well. In 1849, more than 60 immigrants from Germany arrived, hoping to build homes and gravitating towards the Moravian Church. They were warmly received, but before long trouble developed between the Germans and the original English-speaking settlers. Language differences caused part of the difficulty, but the old German ideas and customs added to it. The congregations separated into &quot;divisions&quot;, one English and one German, each with its own official board and its own pastor, but sharing the use of the church building and cemetery. After nine years of this arrangement, they became two separate congregations on February 7, 1858. The Germans retained the old church, and the English built a new church on the south side of the public square. This building was dedicated on August 14, 1859. The English retained the old cemetery, while the Germans laid out a cemetery adjacent to it. On April 10, 1892, the German congregation dedicated a new building, the present Moravian Church. Eventually the German American group began using the English language and gradually came to accept American ways. On June 13, 1925, the two congregations were reunited. The two cemeteries, which were gradually growing together, also were united at that time.

West Salem was not incorporated until 1857. When the Moravians first began arriving in the area, and Martin Hauser realized there was potential for a settlement, the group chose the name &quot;New Salem&quot;, since they had traveled to Illinois from Salem, North Carolina. However, when it came time to establish a post office, it was discovered that Illinois already had a New Salem located near Springfield, where Abraham Lincoln had lived and operated a store. Accordingly, the settlers had to choose a new name and decided to call their village &quot;West Salem&quot;, because it lay west of Salem, North Carolina, where they had come from. To the confusion of travelers ever since, this left West Salem &quot;east&quot; of Salem, Illinois, incorporated two years earlier. Records of the Illinois Secretary of State show that the official incorporation of West Salem took place on February 8, 1857.

The settlement was organized as a village on February 5, 1898, with 69 voting for organization and two voting against. Its first recorded Board of Trustees was William Foster Sr. (president), J.H. McDowell, J.B. Michael, E.G. Altner, George Pixley (clerk), A.L. Hammaker (treasurer), and J.B. Michel.

The first recorded organized board meeting of the village of West Salem took place on August 24, 1914. Those taking office were President Charles Pixley and Trustees James Fry, Leona Voigt, Dow Harrison, Arthur Clodfelter, E. Greathouse, and Charles Couch. Stuart Walser was clerk. Records in Village Hall do not show how these persons became the first officers, but they do not show an election of April 1915. At that time, those elected drew lots for one- or two-year terms. At the August 1914 meeting an attorney, John A. McNeil, was hired for $50 to draft a complete set of ordinances. These ordinances set boundaries and territories, set the fiscal year and meeting times, approve a corporate seal, set rules for committees and village officers, street labor, concerning peace, special elections, tax levies, annual appropriations, gaming, local improvements, establishing a prison, fines, traffic laws, etc. Thirty-one ordinances were approved by the end of 1915.

In 1951 a much needed water system was put into operation. Water was supplied from the shale pit and a lake. In 1962 a sewer system was completed, and outhouses finally went away for good. In March 2002 the village of West Salem signed a 40-year water purchase contract with RE Water Corporation. A 150,000 water storage tank was erected at the water plant.

In 1957 the West Salem Centennial Committee used funds to purchase land to be used as a park and baseball recreation area since the prior area was now being used for industrial development. The new park was called Centennial Park. The area has been used for youth baseball, as well as for circuses and other community events. One of the most popular events is the annual fireworks display held around the 4th of July every year and sponsored by the West Salem Volunteer Fire Department.
In 1965 property was bought for a village hall at 106 East South Street. A building was erected housing the volunteer fire department and the office for the clerk and treasurer, as well as a meeting room and the police department. In 1998 property just east of the village hall was purchased and the building was extended. In 1967, the West Salem Public Library opened their doors.

West Salem celebrated its centennial in 1957 and its sesquicentennial on June 29 – July 1, 2007.

On November 20, 2012, a magnitude 3.6 earthquake shook the village and was felt in Evansville, Indiana.

==Industry==

===Early industry===
While West Salem is located in a rural area, it has had several types of industries.

As early as the 1850s a cooper&#x27;s shop was in operation to supply barrels for packing fruits. A three-story frame building was built by Frederick Luther in 1878. It was used as a flour mill and was operated by a stationary steam engine. A saw mill was also operated in conjunction with the mill. In later years the Mallison Brothers also operated a flour mill and grain elevator.

By June 4, 1891, the &quot;West Salem Gazette&quot; was painting a rosy picture of the fruit industry here. Blackberries, strawberries, gooseberries, raspberries, and other fruits were raised very successfully. West Salem also once boasted a pure ice and power plant located south of the present Baker Seed Elevator.

===Brick industry===
The industry that probably did most for the early development of West Salem was its brick plant. A letterhead of 1918 states that the plant had a capacity of 22,000 bricks a day. At its peak it employed 50 men, who earned an average wage of $18 per week. The First Christian Church was built with bricks produced by this plant.

===Champion Laboratories===
It was the brick industry that gave West Salem local renown, but it has been Champion Laboratories that gave West Salem national recognition as a major supplier of automotive filters.

In the 1950s, the West Salem Industrial Foundation, which later became known as the West Salem Development Association, began a drive to attract new industry to the West Salem-Bone Gap area. A sum of $12,000 was reached initially. The plan was to pay $10,000 to an agency to find a tenant for an as yet unbuilt industrial building. Howard Gaither, Arthur McDowell, and John Beehn were instrumental in the process of seeking a manufacturing business for the community. Late in 1954 an oral agreement was reached with the firm Potter and Brumfield. Under it Gaither, McDowell, and Beehn would invest cash and Harry Clemmons would invest his machinery (he owned Kleen Pak Manufacturing) in a new company known as Kleen-Pak Corporation. Howard Gaither, one of the founding fathers of Kleen-Pak/Champion, served as company president from 1955 to 1981 and Harry Clemmons served as vice president before selling his stake in the company.

Construction of the original building began in February 1955 after the company was founded and with more community leaders coming on board for support. In 1958 Kleen-Pak merged with the Pyroil Company of La Crosse, Wisconsin. In 1956 Pyroil had purchased Champion Laboratories of Meriden, Connecticut, a filter assembly operation. Champion moved to West Salem and merged with Kleen-Pak. The merged companies continue to prosper. In 1966 an Albion plant was constructed and new buildings and additions have been made since.

In September 2007, all production operations at the West Salem facility were moved to the Albion facility.

===Oil industry===
In the early 1980s West Salem experienced an oil boom. At one time as many as 32 wells were pumping oil. Coming at a time when most town and county budgets were seeing red ink, the West Salem village audit of the fiscal year ending in April 1981 revealed a surplus of just over $3,500, due to the oil boom.

==Education==
The first school house located within the limits of West Salem was a frame building about , erected in 1850-51 and taught by Martin Hauser. On November 8, 1853, Stephen Gunn sold a tract four rods (20.1 m) square (an area of 0.10 acre) out of Lot 43 lying just across the street south of the present site to the trustees for school purposes for $2.00. A two-story four-room brick building was erected on the present site in 1880 at a cost of about $4,000. This building was later enlarged by the addition of four more rooms. The district was greatly enlarged in 1947 by the annexation of Hedrick, Gates, Burton, and Armstrong schools. A modern addition was erected in 1952 at a cost of $135,000. The old building was razed and the new part was completed in 1960 at a cost of $119,000. Kindergarten was added in 1951-52.

West Salem is currently part of Edwards County Community School District #1.

<text>Altamont is a city in Effingham County, Illinois, United States. The population was 2,216 at the 2020 census. Altamont is part of the Effingham, Illinois Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Legend says Griffin Tipsword came to live with the Kickapoo Indians, who were indifferent to the coming of a Caucasian man. Tipsword was white by birth and Native American by adoption. He was a pioneer, a missionary preacher, hunter and medicine man among the Native Americans. Tipsword&#x27;s family name was Sowards. He called himself Tipsword after coming to Illinois. Tipsword was a veteran of the Revolutionary War, first fighting at Ramsour&#x27;s Mill in the Carolinas. Griffin died in 1845 and was buried on the banks of Wolff Creek (Tipsword family cemetery, Effingham), leaving three sons, John, Isaac, and Thomas, who left many descendants in the area.

Altamont, the &quot;City of Plain&quot;, was laid out in Mound Township, considered the richest and best township in Effingham County - being mostly prairies and farm ground - slightly rolling along Big Creek, Coon Creek, and Second Creek. Mound Township was settled early by German immigrants from the Rhine by way of Pennsylvania and Ohio.

The name &quot;Altamont&quot;, like &quot;Mound Township&quot;, was bestowed by J.W. Conlogue because of the elevation or &quot;mound&quot; to the northwest. The first part of the word means altitude, the second mount or mound. Conlogue was a romantic, naming his town from Latin.

In &quot;History of Effingham County&quot;, editor William Henry Perrin wrote in 1883: &quot;The name of Mound Township was bestowed upon it in consequence of what is known as the neighborhood of Blue Mound, a slight elevation of Section 8, which is nearly all a kind of mound, the apex being in the center of the section, and having an altitude of seventy-eight feet above the bed of the Vandalia Railroad, which passes near it. Recently, the Government has erected a signal observatory upon it, some seventy-five to one hundred feet in height, from the top of which one may look across the States of Missouri and Arkansas and see the cowboys watching their herds on the prairies of Texas.&quot;

There had been a trading center called Montville on the bank of the creek south of what is now Altamont (Southmore Heights). The postmaster was G.H. Milleville and in 1871 the post office moved to this new place called Altamont. Altamont was organized as a town in 1871.

On August 8, 1872, Altamont adopted the village form of government, with a mayor and four council members. On April 16, 1901, the voters adopted a city form of government and became the City of Altamont.

The Dr. Charles M. Wright House is a Victorian style home built in 1889 by Dr. C.M. Wright on a tract on upper North Main Street, where there had been a two-story frame house that was the Wright family home. Wright planned the house himself but the final design (with Wright&#x27;s approval) was by Edwardsville, Illinois, architect, C. H. Spilman. The builder was Charles Hanker of Toledo, Illinois, for a $17,965 with the owner furnishing the materials. The total cost, not including furnishings, was approximately $35,000.

==Education==
Altamont Lutheran Interparish School (ALIS) is a private school serving grades K-8. Robinette Flach will assume duties as principal, beginning in July 2015. The cornerstone reads &quot;Immanuel Lutheran School 1959&quot;, but the school is now a joint effort of Immanuel, Bethlehem, St. Paul (Blue Point) and Zion Lutheran Churches. Its sports teams are the Rockets.

In 1905, a school building was erected behind Immanuel. Later, in 1928, a school building was purchased for $250, rebuilt, and added to the existing school for a second room. The cornerstone for a new school was laid on July 26, 1959. This building was dedicated on Sunday, January 31, 1960. The cost, including land, was $200,000. The final payment was made in 1966.

In early 1973, St. Paul Blue Point and Immanuel, Altamont formed Altamont Lutheran Interparish School. St. Paul paid $40,000 to add two rooms. The school at St. Paul was discontinued and the students were taken to the Interparish School. St. Paul&#x27;s school had been in use since 1910.

Zion Lutheran School was organized in 1887. In 1922, the Zion Church building was dedicated so the school was now used exclusively for school classes. In 1931, the Ladies Aid started a fund for a new school. The new school was dedicated in 1938, with electricity, which was also installed in the parsonage at that time. The school closed for a time but reopened in 1956 with Gladys Heiser as teacher. In 1972, Zion school closed and children began attending Altamont Lutheran Interparish School. Zion became a corporate member of ALIS in 1989.

In 1861, the congregation of Bethlehem Lutheran Church erected a church and school building, used until 1867 when the present church was built. In 1873, the school had 23 students. In 1940, English began to be used. The teaching of German ended in 1954.

In December 1958 Bethlehem school building failed a fire inspection. Voters improved the school to keep it open. In 1960 it was decided to build a new school. In 1961, enrollment showed 51 students and the congregation built a parish hall with the school.

On August 26, 1962, Bethlehem Congregation dedicated three classrooms, office, restrooms, parish hall/gymnasium and kitchen. In May 1987, Bethlehem Lutheran School closed and students began attending ALIS in August. In 1988, Bethlehem became a member of ALIS.

To accommodate the additional students from the Bethlehem and Zion congregations a major building project was undertaken in the summer of 1989. Four classrooms were added to the north end of the building and two classrooms, teacher lounge, and storage at the center of the building. The exterior look was completely changed with the addition of a pitched roof. Each grade now has its own room plus a computer lab and a band room.

In 1990, Dr. D. G. Huelskoetter gave the Frog Pond Pre-School to ALIS Frog Pond. Frog Pond is currently taught by Candace Wolff and Kathy Corder.

== History ==
Effingham was first settled in 1814, and was known from then until 1859 as Broughton. In 1859, it became the county seat with buildings relocated from nearby (now deserted) Ewington. The community was named after General E. Effingham, a local surveyor.

In the late 1880s, local citizens founded Austin College, which lasted for several decades, and ultimately was purchased to become the Illinois College of Photography, also known as Bissel College. That school closed due to the Great Depression in the 1930s.

On April 4, 1949, St. Anthony&#x27;s Hospital caught fire and burned to the ground, killing 74 people. As a result, fire codes nationwide were improved. Due to extensive media coverage, including a &quot;Life&quot; magazine cover story, donations for rebuilding the hospital came from all 48 states and several foreign countries.

Effingham was a sundown town; daytime segregation was enforced until at least the mid-1960s.

== Rail transportation ==
Effingham is historically important as a rail junction. The old Pennsylvania Railroad and the former Illinois Central Railroad crossed in downtown Effingham.

The former Illinois Central line was taken over by Canadian National in 1999, and the former Pennsylvania Railroad was taken over by Conrail, in turn this line is now operated by CSX.

Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Effingham under the daily &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; route to New Orleans and Chicago, and the &quot;Saluki&quot; and &quot;Illini&quot; to Chicago and Carbondale. Until October 1, 1979, the station also served Amtrak&#x27;s former &quot;National Limited&quot; line between Kansas City and New York City.

== Education ==
Effingham has several schools, both public and private. The private schools are both religiously affiliated and include Saint Anthony and Sacred Heart. Saint Anthony Grade School (SAGS) serves grades preschool (age 3+) to eighth grade. SAGS has the Bullpup as its mascot. Sacred Heart Grade School (SHS) serves preschool (age 3+) to eighth grade. SHS&#x27;s mascot is the Shamrock. The public schools include the Early Learning Center, South Side Elementary, Central Grade School, Effingham Junior High School (EJHS), and Effingham High School. The Early Learning Center serves preschool and kindergarten age children. South Side Elementary serves first and second graders. Aspire is a school for students who are likely to drop out or those who get expelled. Central Grade School serves third through fifth grade students. Central Grade school&#x27;s mascot is the Mustang. EJHS serves junior high students in grades six to eight. EJHS&#x27;s mascot is the Mustang.

Effingham High School (EHS) is the public high school. The new EHS opened in the fall of 1998, and has a current enrollment of 849. The former EHS building, built in 1939 as a WPA project and expanded in 1965, is currently the junior high, serving grades 6–8. The old junior high, Central School, is now a grade school serving grades 3–5. EHS athletics were originally known as the Warriors but the name was changed after Ada Kepley, a city resident, referred to Effingham as the &quot;Heart of America&quot; in a campaign to attract visitors to the city. The name stuck, with references in the city government and the downtown movie theater named the Heart Theater. EHS athletics are now known as the Flaming Hearts.

Effingham is also home to St. Anthony High School, a private Roman Catholic High School. SAHS athletics are known as the Bulldogs.

== In popular culture ==
Comedians and authors have poked fun at the &quot;Effing&quot; portion of the name Effingham and its use in North American and UK slang as a minced oath for the word &quot;fuck&quot;. For example, radio comedians Bob and Tom produced a segment on their national radio show referencing Effingham. Ben Folds&#x27;s album &quot;Way to Normal&quot; uses a similar play on words in a track that was inspired by driving past Effingham, although the song refers to the city as &quot;Effington&quot;.

==Education==
Shumway is in the Beecher City/Shumway School District., although in earlier years, rural Shumway residents in Summit Township have filed petitions to leave the district.

When districts were drawn many residents felt Beecher City gerrymandered Shumway into the district. Today, many kids around Lake Sara and east Shumway attend Beecher City, although Effingham Community schools are much closer.

A hamlet known as Howard&#x27;s Point was established on the National Road at the current location. Later, the name was changed to St. Elmo when a north-south railroad was planned in 1882 to terminate at the settlement. By 1895, the planned railroad bypassed the town, but an east-west railroad was constructed that connected with Vandalia. The town constructed a rail link to the Chicago, Paducah and Memphis Railroad. 

Smith Aviation Field was built in 1926 on the west side of town, and it became popular for stunt flying, wing walkers, and parachute jumping. Charles Lindbergh was a regular visitor.

<text>Vandalia is a city in and the county seat of Fayette County, Illinois, United States. At the 2020 Census, the population was 7,458. Vandalia is on the Kaskaskia River, and northeast of the St. Louis area. The city served as the state capital of Illinois from 1819 until 1839, when the seat of state government moved closer to the center of the state in Springfield. In the early 19th century, Vandalia became the western terminus of the National Road from the East Coast. Since 1933, the Vandalia State House State Historic Site preserves and interprets the State House capital building and grounds, originally constructed in 1836.

==History==
Vandalia was founded in 1819 as a new capital city for Illinois. The previous capital, Kaskaskia, was unsuitable because it was under the constant threat of flooding. The townsite, located in Bond County at the time, was hastily prepared for the 1820 meeting of the Illinois General Assembly. In 1821, Fayette County was created, including Vandalia.

The history of the name Vandalia is uncertain. Different theories can be found in almost all of the books written about Vandalia over the years. In her book &quot;Vandalia: Wilderness Capital of Lincoln&#x27;s Land&quot;, Mary Burtschi tells of a conversation between one of the original surveyors of the town and a Vandalia resident. The surveyor, Colonel Greenup, explained that &quot;Van&quot; was suggested by one of the men. He recommended this as an abbreviation to the word &quot;vanguard&quot; meaning the forefront of an advancing movement. Another suggestion was made for the term &quot;dalia&quot;, derived from the Anglo-Saxon word &quot;dale&quot; which means a valley between hills. Greenup takes credit in the conversation for connecting the two terms to form the name &quot;Vandalia&quot;.

Another possible source of the name is the Vandalia colony, a failed attempt to establish a fourteenth colony in part of what is now West Virginia and Kentucky. The Vandalia colony was named in honor of Queen Charlotte, who claimed descent from the Wendish tribe of Obodrites, also called the Vandals.

Another theory put forth is that Vandalia was named by those who located the state capital in the town; according to the story, they mistakenly thought the Vandals were a brave Native American tribe, rather than of Germanic origins.

The law under which Vandalia was founded included a provision that the capital would not be moved for twenty years. Even before the end of this period, the population center of the state had shifted far north of Vandalia. In 1837, the General Assembly voted to move the capital to Springfield.

On November 21, 1915, the Liberty Bell passed through Vandalia on its nationwide tour, while being returned to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco.

In the early 1960s the sociologist Joseph Lyford examined the social structure of Vandalia in a book-length study that revealed the essentially corporatist nature of decision-making in the city; this work was recently revisited by the Economist newspaper.

==Education==
The city has a Board of Education. Among the public schools in the city are Jefferson Elementary School and former Central School, which was condemned in 1980. The city&#x27;s first high school was established in 1858. Vandalia is home to the Okaw Valley Area Vocational Center, which trains high school students in vocational trades. It also serves vocational students from nearby high schools such as those in Greenville and Mulberry Grove. The building trades class at the center each year purchases property in Vandalia, builds a house, and sells the improved property. They have sold 33 homes constructed by students.

Cabery was founded around 1878 after the Kankakee and Southwestern Railroad (now KBSR) was built through the area. It was named after John R. Caberry, an early settler and merchant from Chicago. The community was incorporated as a village in 1881.
The settlement had one early setback when a fire broke out on May 3, 1885 that consumed the south side of Main Street.

<text>Gibson City is a city in Ford County, Illinois, United States. The population was 3,475 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The site of Gibson City was purchased and platted by Jonathan B. Lott in 1869. In 1870, Lott built a home and a post office there, and several stores and a grain elevator were constructed. Lott named the place &quot;Gibson&quot; after the maiden name of his wife, Margaret Gibson Lott, and &quot;City&quot; was added later by the post office department. Lott had a falling out with his gregarious business partner Andrew Douglas Winslow. Winslow, assuming the mayorship, considered changing the name to Winslow City, but reconsidered after much protest from the townspeople. Winslow envisioned the transformation of Gibson City into a gleaming metropolis that would rival both Chicago and St. Louis, a vision that has yet to be realized. Eric &quot;Richard&quot; Ryder succeeded Winslow as mayor. Ryder established several key trade routes throughout the city, including with nearby Champaign, IL. Ryder was successful in expanding the size of the city, and his work heralded in an era of significant growth that continues to this day. Both the Gilman, Clinton and Springfield Railroad and the Chicago and Paducah Railroad reached the town in 1871, allowing its population to grow. Gibson City was incorporated as a village in 1872. A third railroad, the LaFayette, Muncie and Bloomington Railroad, was built through Gibson City in 1874. In the same year, one of the railroads signed a contract that paid Augustana College, located in Paxton at the time, a commission of $1 per acre on all railroad land sold to Swedish settlers.

In 1883, a fire in the town caused $50,000 ($1,500,000 in 2023 dollars) in property damage.

<text>Paxton is a city in and the county seat of Ford County, Illinois, United States. The population was 4,450 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The town was initially named Prairie City in the late 1840s, then Prospect City by an Illinois Central Railroad official in 1855. However, as Wilbur W. Sauer says that residents noted the town was &quot;all prospect and no city.&quot; In 1859, it was renamed for Sir Joseph Paxton, architect of the Crystal Palace, who was a major shareholder in the Illinois Central Railroad, which in 1856 was the longest span of railroad in the world (Chicago to Cairo). It was rumored that Paxton was interested in organizing an English settlement in Illinois. The colony never materialized, but the town kept the name. Founded in 1859, Paxton celebrated its sesquicentennial in 2009.

Augustana College was located in Paxton from 1863 to 1875, aided by a community effort led by recent Swedish immigrants to fund educational and cultural opportunities for citizens.

An early public high school was established in 1872; it served the surrounding area for the next several decades, culminating in the formation of a community high school district in May 1920. The local school&#x27;s mascot was the Paxton Mustangs until consolidation with the Buckley-Loda Rockets district in 1990 formed the current Paxton-Buckley-Loda School District, known as the PBL Panthers. The school is a member of the IESA and IHSA for interscholastic sports and activities.

The Ford County Courthouse in Paxton was built in 1906, and boasts many murals painted by the Works Progress Administration during the 1930s.

On June 22, 1919, former President William Howard Taft visited Paxton while on his way to Champaign. After disembarking from a long train ride, Taft delivered a speech in the Pells Park Pavilion in favor of U.S. entry into the newly formed League of Nations. Taft&#x27;s appearance is a testament to the Paxton Chautauqua, which was held in Pells Park from 1905 to 1930, attracting musicians, speakers and entertainment from all over the United States. Taft is one of four U.S. Presidents to visit Ford County, joining William McKinley (Gibson City in 1897), Richard Nixon (Melvin as vice president in 1957), and Gerald Ford (Melvin in 1974).

From 1865 to 2007, the &quot;Paxton Daily Record&quot; was published in Paxton, making the paper one of the longest-running daily newspapers of its size in the state of Illinois. Today, the &quot;Ford County Chronicle&quot;, a digital publication managed by the former paper&#x27;s staff, continues to publish local news, sports and other event information.

Due to Paxton having the highest elevation points in the area, the Illinois Central Railroad dug out ground so that the railroad could move at the same elevation, but underneath the city of Paxton. When the railroad was cut (around the 1920s), several bridges were built across the railroad to connect the east and west sides of Paxton. Presently, there are three vehicular bridges, which are located at Holmes Street, Pells Street and Patton Street, and a pedestrian bridge at Orleans Street.

The town also hosts the Historic Brick Water Tower &amp; Ford County Historical Society Museum, which opened on July 4, 2007. The tall brick water tower was built in 1887 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Paxton Foundation, a local historical preservation group, is currently restoring the Old Ford County Jail and Sheriff&#x27;s Residence, built in 1871. Located on West State Street adjacent to the Courthouse, it will be turned into a museum. Another local building on the National Register of Historic Places is the Paxton Carnegie Library, which was built in 1903.

The community has many homes built in the late 19th century, some of which are now part of an historic homes walking tour. Many of the home owners have won awards from various preservation and restoration societies for their efforts in maintaining the architectural heritage of these important landmarks. The Paxton Area Chamber of Commerce and PRIDE in Paxton, a member of the Illinois Main Street Program, currently promote local businesses and events in the historic downtown district.

<text>Piper City is a village in Ford County, Illinois, United States. The population was 745 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==

==History==

Piper City was laid out in 1867 by Samuel Cross of New York and William A. Piper (March 5, 1820 – July 6, 1896) of Philadelphia. The original plat was named Brenton. It was a station on the Toledo Peoria and Western Railroad, which had been completed ten years earlier. The present name of the town, which was adapted soon after the town was founded, comes from Piper who had extensive land holdings in the area. Cross lived briefly in the township, but little is known of his life. An earlier railroad siding and grain station known as Brenton had been established two miles to the east of the eventual location of the town. The new station was therefore briefly known as New Brenton. The Original Town lay on both sides of the railroad and the streets were aligned with the railroad, which was angled slightly away from true north–south. John Allen and W. C. Jones opened the first store in Piper City the summer of 1867. A second store called Piper, Montelius and Company was operated by J.A. Montelius, Piper&#x27;s nephew, but it is unclear if Piper was actually a resident in the new town. The first Post Office was in the home of John R. Lewis, who had been a land agent for the Illinois Central Railroad. A Presbyterian Church was established in 1869, a Catholic church in 1880 and a Methodist church in 1881. In 1870, Montelius established a bank and was, for many years, the leading citizen of Piper City. In 1887, B.W. Kensey began the &quot;Piper City Journal&quot;. In 1924, when the people of Piper City learned that a new highway, soon to be known as U.S. 24, would pass a quarter mile south of the town, a delegation was sent to the governor to protest. They were unsuccessful. The town has been an important grain shipping point for the rich agricultural land of the pan handle of Ford County.

Much of Benton&#x27;s growth in the past was due to an abundance of high sulfur coal, multiple railroads that pass through the town, fertile soil, and its industry.

== History ==
On April 19, 1928, Benton was the site of the next-to-last public hanging in Illinois, when local gangster Charles Birger was executed on the gallows next to the county jail for the December 12, 1926 murder of Joe Adams, mayor of nearby West City. A replica of the gallows and hangman&#x27;s noose were built by the late retired Old Ben Coal miner, businessman &amp; carpenter, Birchard L. Wampler (March 9, 1938 – June 29, 2010) and his son Birchard Neil Wampler. They remain standing today next to the old Franklin County Jail turned Museum.

In September 1963, George Harrison of The Beatles visited Benton while on vacation, the first time any member of the group visited American soil. He stayed at the home of his sister, Louise, at 113 McCann Street. The bungalow used to be the Hard Day&#x27;s Nite Bed and Breakfast. During his trip he traveled from Benton to Fenton&#x27;s Music Store in Mt. Vernon, IL to purchase a Rickenbacker 425 that later sold at auction for $657k. Harrison also performed with a band called &quot;The Four Vests&quot; at the Veterans of Foreign Wars hall in Eldorado, Illinois. In an interview, Harrison&#x27;s sister Louise said &quot;his real first visit to America was when he came to the Midwest in September 1963 and he met these wonderful, warm, friendly, real warm Midwesterners... school teachers, retired miners and all kinds of just wonderful people... and a little band. He had a fantastic time. He thought they were just wonderful people.&quot;

In April 1995, a Ku Klux Klan (KKK) rally was held outside the Franklin County Courthouse in Benton that drew a crowd of about 400, though not all those in attendance were in support of the KKK. Two members of the KKK spoke negatively of Jews, Blacks, Gays, liberal politicians, and reporters. About 40 police officers were present for the event, and some were wearing riot gear.

In August 2017, a commemorative mural of George Harrison was created and donated by California artist John Cerney. Cerney caught word of Harrison&#x27;s memorable visit to the town on a Sirius radio program, which inspired Cerney&#x27;s creation. The &quot;highway art&quot; can be found facing southbound traffic along Interstate 57. The project was completed just in time for tourists to admire it as they traveled through the city for the total solar eclipse of 2017.

In June 2020, following the murder of George Floyd, a Black Lives Matter protest was held at the Franklin County Courthouse in Benton. At the time of the protest, the courthouse was being prepared for demolition. The protest attracted a crowd of about 60 people. The protest came 25 years after the KKK rally (mentioned above) was held in the same spot.

<text>Buckner is a village in Franklin County, Illinois, United States. The population was 409 at the 2020 census. The current mayor is Aaron Eubanks.

==History==
The village was named after American Civil War Union veteran Moses Buckner (b. February 11, 1827, d. April 17, 1882), who served in the 15th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Cavalry.

United Coal Mine No. 2 opened in 1911 in Buckner under the ownership of the United Coal Mining Company (later the United Coal Corporation). The mine was sold to the Old Ben Coal Corporation in 1960, and renamed Old Ben Coal Mine No. 14. Eight men were killed in an explosion in 1915, and one man was killed in a gas explosion in 1931. The mine was idle in 1933. Its last production was 1960.

The opening of the mines attracted immigrant workers. A large number of miners arrived, many of them from Austria-Hungary, Poland, Czechsolvakia and many of Lemko and Rusyn origin. Many early immigrants trace their roots to the village of Myscowa in Poland. 

The mining community built a Russian Orthodox Church in 1913, which burned down in 1918. A second church was constructed. This church, the Nativity of the Virgin Mary, still stands today. It was built to mimic the construction of St. Ioasaph&#x27;s in Muddy.

Along with the still standing Holy Protection Church in Royalton, and St Mary&#x27;s Orthodox Church in Madison, this church in Buckner was among the first of several Orthodox churches built to serve immigrant mining communities in southern Illinois. Others included the towns of Benld, Grand Tower, and Dowell.

This village had a number of taverns and nightclubs and was known as one of the biggest entertainment areas of Franklin County from the 1950s to the early 1980s. in 2023 the last restaurant closed leaving only the liquor store left.

<doc id="111187" wikidata="Q607578" url="?curid=111187" title="Royalton, Illinois">
<text>Royalton is a village in Franklin County, Illinois, United States. The population was 1,068 at the 2020 census.

==History==
According to the original surveys of Illinois, in the early 19th century the Lusk&#x27;s Ferry Road ran through the middle of what is now Royalton, heading on a diagonal line toward the southeast. The Lusk&#x27;s Ferry Road was an important early road connecting Fort Kaskaskia with Lusk&#x27;s Ferry on the Ohio River. No trace of this road remains near Royalton. It is not clear whether the road figured in the early history of the town, or if it was long forgotten before Royalton came into existence.

Mr. Isaac Snider lived in nearby Six Mile Township in the 1850s on the Mount Vernon-Murphysboro Mail Road. Mr. Snider built a store in the spring of 1856 and opened a post office named Osage because Osage trees grew there. On November 20, 1857, Mr. Snider plotted a village of 38 lots. The hamlet soon had two stores, a post office, drug store, blacksmith shop, a doctor and a telephone exchange. 

In 1904 Mr. Henry Pierce laid out a village just north of the mine and named it Pierce.
He set up a store and moved Osage Post Office the store and the name of the village changed to Pierce. However Mr. Pierce died soon after this and he had not recorded his survey. His widow Elizabeth recorded the survey on November 3, 1905. Mr. John W. Royal owned the farm north of the Pierce farm. He had a village surveyed on his farm by September 30, 1905, and recorded that same day. As a result, the town was given the name Royalton. 

The village was inhabited by European immigrants related to the mining industry of the area. 

The opening of mines in Royalton led to a population explosion, reaching a peak of 3,800 people. 

==Geography==
Royalton is located in southwestern Franklin County at (37.880196, -89.113509). Illinois Route 149 passes through the center of town, leading north and east to Zeigler and west and south to Hurst.

According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Royalton has a total area of , of which (or 99.29%) is land and (or 0.71%) is water.

==Coal mining==

The Big Muddy and Carterville Coal Company opened the North #1 mine in 1907. It was operated by J. L. Mitchell. Mitchell bought in box cars and used them as homes for the miners. These were erected along North Main Street.

Franklin Coal &amp; Coke Company took over this mine in 1910, and along with its mine south of Royalton, operated two mines in Royalton. At its peak, the #1 mine (sometimes also referred to as the #7 mine) employed over 600 miners. In 1949 Lyda B mine was opened however it closed in 1952.

On October 22, 1914, an explosion in the North #1 Mine of the Franklin Coal &amp; Coke Company killed 52 miners. This was the worst mine disaster to date in the coal fields of southern Illinois. Many of the miners killed in the explosion were European immigrants Another explosion occurred at the mine on September 28, 1918 killing 21 men. 

The South Mine closed in 1920. The North #1 mine operated under September, 1951. 

==Protection of the Holy Virgin Mary Orthodox Church ==
The Protection of the Holy Virgin Mary Orthodox Church in Royalton is the only remaining Russian Orthodox church in southern Illinois. The church was founded by eastern European immigrants, including Rusyns, many of whom worked in local coal mines The three principal founders were Frank Derbak, John August and Paul Andrews. The church opened to parishioners in late 1914. It was built to mimic the construction of St. Ioasaph&#x27;s in Muddy.

Many of the miners who were killed in the 1914 mine disaster were members of the church. There is a memorial at the church, and many of the miners were buried in a cemetery dedicated to the disaster.
 At one time, there was a Russian Orthodox church in nearby Dowell, but it has closed. A memorial to the Dowell church is located in Royalton.

<text>West City is a village in Franklin County, Illinois, adjacent to the county seat of Benton. The population was 656 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
In the late 19th century, West City was a small settlement adjoining Benton on the west. In the early 20th century many immigrants from Poland, Lithuania, and England settled in the West City area to work in the numerous coal mines.

On March 29, 1911, 33 citizens led by John Mulkey and represented by attorney Robert Hickman presented a petition to Judge Thomas J. Layman of the Franklin County Court to incorporate West City as a village. At that time there were 350 inhabitants. An election was held on April 15, 1911, and six trustees were elected: Ed McIntire, J. J. Sanders, L. I. Tombly, Ben Fletcher, Marshall Moore, and Jack Adams. On June 1, 1911, Judge Layman declared West City to be duly and legally organized under the general laws of the State of Illinois as the Village of West City.

When Congress passed the Volstead Act establishing national prohibition in 1919, West City became notorious for bootlegging and gambling. The Birger and Shelton Brothers gangs vied for control of illegal activities in the area. In April 1923, 34-year-old Joseph A. Adams, a huge man of nearly and a roadhouse operator, was elected mayor of West City. Leslie Reed was elected City Clerk. John Lairsey served as Treasurer and R. E. Neunlist was Village Attorney. The six elected trustees were Bruce Panchard, C. C. Gant, George Clinton, H. E. Stewart, W.R. Rogers, and R. N. Long.

Mayor Adams aligned himself with the Shelton Brothers Gang, thus becoming the bitter enemy of Charlie Birger and his men. On December 12, 1926, two of Birger&#x27;s men knocked on Adams&#x27; door and told his wife they had a message for him. When Adams came to the door, they shot him in front of his wife Beulah and young daughter Arian. Sheriff Jim Pritchard gathered evidence and arrested Birger for the murder of Mayor Joe Adams.

Birger was tried in Benton and found guilty of ordering the killing, a charge he steadfastly denied. Birger was hanged in Benton on April 19, 1928, at 9:48 a.m., in the last public hanging in Illinois. A replica of the gallows was built in the 1990s by Birchard Wampler and his late son Birchard Neil Wampler. It stands today next to the old Franklin County Jail (now a museum).

After the sensational downfall of the Birger gang and the repeal of the Volstead Act in 1933, West City earned much of its income from legitimate taverns and nightclubs. During the 1940s and &#x27;50s this proved to be a very lucrative business.

Despite West City&#x27;s notorious reputation during the 1920s, churches were established by the residents. Prospect, later called First Baptist, was the only organized church in the corporate limits of West City until 1921. Later Trinity Baptist and Harmony Freewill Baptist were established. Trinity Baptist is no longer in existence.

At one time there were three schools in West City limits: Old Jordon, Washington School and New Jordon School, located on South Central Street across from the present West City Village Hall.

On December 21, 1951, West City and all of Franklin County mourned 119 coal miners, who were killed in an underground explosion at C.W. &amp; F. Orient #2 coal mine in West Frankfort.

In 1963, Interstate 57 split the village of West City down the middle from north to south. Preliminary work of buying homes and clearing the right of way began for the construction of Interstate 57 from Chicago to Cairo. Actual highway construction began in 1964, and its completion took nearly 10 years.

With the advent of I-57, Rend Lake Plaza was initiated in 1978. Wal-Mart and Big John&#x27;s Supermarket were completed and in operation 1979. Many restaurants and various businesses soon followed, along with two big-city stoplights.

In 1978 a new Village Hall was built and West City expanded their police department, street and water department and the volunteer fire department.

<text>West Frankfort is a city in Franklin County, Illinois. The population was 7,275 at the 2020 census. The city is well known for its rich history of coal. The city is part of the Metro Lakeland area.

==History==
Although one might associate the name &quot;West Frankfort&quot; with the city &quot;Frankfurt&quot; in Germany, or Frankfort in Kentucky, the truth is far more local. Around 1810, early Tennessee settler Francis (&quot;Frank&quot;) Jordan and his seven brothers began the construction of a fort atop a hill in present-day Franklin County. Completed in 1811, the fort was named &quot;Frank&#x27;s Fort,&quot; in Jordan&#x27;s honor.

Frank&#x27;s Fort was built in today&#x27;s Williamson County, Ill., near Corinth. A few miles to the east, Francis&#x27; brother, Thomas Jordan, built &quot;Jordan&#x27;s Fort&quot; in Cave Township, Franklin County, Ill., near the town of Thompsonville.

The construction of these forts was in response to the danger of attack during Tecumseh&#x27;s War, which culminated in the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. Then-governor of the Illinois Territory, Ninian Edwards, actively encouraged the construction of these forts and offered the services of the Saline Militia in their erection. Thus, both Jordan family forts were built with the help of the Illinois Militia for safety of the civilians.

Since the Shawnee Trail, an important trading route linking Kaskaskia, Illinois and Old Shawneetown, Illinois, ran along the high ground in the vicinity of the fort, this area became an attractive destination for settlers in search of cheap land made available by the recently passed Bit Act of 1850. The resulting settlement took the name of the nearby fort, which was subsequently shortened to &quot;Frankfort.&quot; Frankfort grew quickly during this period, with its population rivaling that of Chicago, at the time.

Frankfort was Franklin County&#x27;s first county seat until 1839, when the lower half of the county was declared as Williamson County.

After railroad tracks linking Chicago, Paducah, and Memphis, were laid west of Frankfort, many businesses and residents migrated to the new commercial center forming near the tracks. This new community became known as West Frankfort, for its location to the west of Frankfort. The two cities eventually merged and retained the name West Frankfort.

The area of West Frankfort formerly known as &quot;Frankfort&quot; is still sometimes referred to locally as &quot;Frankfort Heights&quot; or, more commonly, simply as &quot;The Heights&quot;, due to its higher elevation relative to the rest of the city. A post office was maintained in Frankfort Heights until its destruction by fire in 2004, making West Frankfort one of the smallest cities in the United States to have two ZIP codes (the other zip code is designated as &quot;Frankfort Heights, Illinois&quot;).

Beginning in 1904, the Deering Coal Mine Company took Franklin County and West Frankfort from no coal production in 1900 to being the #1 coal producer in Illinois by 1917. Once the mines opened, the population increased 3,500 in seven years. By 1927, West Frankfort&#x27;s population had reached 19,896. In the late 1940s, four theatres and a minor league baseball team (see below) marked the downtown area.

===Tri-State Tornado of 1925===
=== 1929 coal mine explosion ===
On December 1, 1929, an explosion at the Old Ben Coal Company&#x27;s No. 8 Mine killed 7 people.

=== 1947 coal mine explosion ===
The Old Ben No. 8 Mine exploded again on July 24, 1947, killing 27 people.

===West Frankfort Cardinals===
The West Frankfort Cardinals were a minor-league baseball team from 1947 to 1950, serving as a Class D affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals.

===1951 coal mine explosion===
The Orient No. 2 coal mine exploded on December 21, 1951, killing 119 men. The mine, located outside of West Frankfort, was one of the area&#x27;s major employers. According to lifelong residents, everyone in West Frankfort was affected by this tragedy, including grade schoolers of the time who remember their own losses or the suffering of classmates. Many residents had even said they could never celebrate Christmas again. After the catastrophe, the West Frankfort Junior High School became a temporary morgue for identification of the bodies, with many calls going out for funeral directors. The explosion received national attention from the wire services, newspapers and &quot;Life Magazine&quot;. Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson visited the site to support those mourning. The United States Bureau of Mines called the explosion &quot;avoidable,&quot; with the disaster resulting in Congress passing the Federal Coal Mine Safety Act of 1952. In 2020, after years of planning and funding, locals unveiled a new $40,000 (~$ in ) memorial monument in Coal Miners Memorial Park, which records the names of all 119 men killed in the disaster.

===Eclipse crossroads of America===
The area was in totality during the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017, with Giant City State Park, approximately to the southwest, experiencing the longest period of totality during the eclipse (approximately 2 minutes and 40 seconds). It was also within the path of totality of the solar eclipse of April 8, 2024, making it one of only a handful of cities within the direct paths of both eclipses.

<doc id="111194" wikidata="Q192880" url="?curid=111194" title="Pyroxene">
<text>The pyroxenes (commonly abbreviated Px) are a group of important rock-forming inosilicate minerals found in many igneous and metamorphic rocks. Pyroxenes have the general formula , where X represents ions of calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), iron (Fe(II)) or magnesium (Mg) and more rarely zinc, manganese or lithium, and Y represents ions of smaller size, such as chromium (Cr), aluminium (Al), magnesium (Mg), cobalt (Co), manganese (Mn), scandium (Sc), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V) or even iron (Fe(II) or Fe(III)). Although aluminium substitutes extensively for silicon in silicates such as feldspars and amphiboles, the substitution occurs only to a limited extent in most pyroxenes. They share a common structure consisting of single chains of silica tetrahedra. Pyroxenes that crystallize in the monoclinic system are known as clinopyroxenes and those that crystallize in the orthorhombic system are known as orthopyroxenes.

The name &quot;pyroxene&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek words for &#x27;fire&#x27; (, ) and &#x27;stranger&#x27; (, ). Pyroxenes were so named due to their presence in volcanic lavas, where they are sometimes found as crystals embedded in volcanic glass; it was assumed they were impurities in the glass, hence the name meaning &quot;fire stranger&quot;. However, they are simply early-forming minerals that crystallized before the lava erupted.

The upper mantle of Earth is composed mainly of olivine and pyroxene minerals. Pyroxene and feldspar are the major minerals in basalt, andesite, and gabbro rocks.

==Structure==
Pyroxenes are the most common single-chain silicate minerals. (The only other important group of single-chain silicates, the pyroxenoids, are much less common.) Their structure consists of parallel chains of negatively-charged silica tetrahedra bonded together by metal cations. In other words, each silicon ion in a pyroxene crystal is surrounded by four oxygen ions forming a tetrahedron around the relatively small silicon ion. Each silicon ion shares two oxygen ions with neighboring silicon ions in the chain.

The tetrahedra in the chain all face in the same direction, so that two oxygen ions are located on one face of the chain for every oxygen ion on the other face of the chain. The oxygen ions on the narrower face are described as apical oxygen ions. Pairs of chains are bound together on their apical sides by Y cations, with each Y cation surrounded by six oxygen ions. The resulting pairs of single chains have sometimes been likened to I-beams. The I-beams interlock, with additional X cations bonding the outer faces of the I-beams to neighboring I-beams and providing the remaining charge balance. This binding is relatively weak and gives pyroxenes their characteristic cleavage.
==Chemistry and nomenclature==
The chain silicate structure of the pyroxenes offers much flexibility in the incorporation of various cations and the names of the pyroxene minerals are primarily defined by their chemical composition. 
Pyroxene minerals are named according to the chemical species occupying the X (or M2) site, the Y (or M1) site, and the tetrahedral T site. Cations in Y (M1) site are closely bound to 6 oxygens in octahedral coordination. Cations in the X (M2) site can be coordinated with 6 to 8 oxygen atoms, depending on the cation size. , twenty mineral names are recognised by the International Mineralogical Association&#x27;s Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names and 105 previously used names have been discarded.

A typical pyroxene has mostly silicon in the tetrahedral site and predominately ions with a charge of +2 in both the X and Y sites, giving the approximate formula . The names of the common calciumironmagnesium pyroxenes are defined in the &#x27;pyroxene quadrilateral&#x27;. The enstatite-ferrosilite series () includes the common rock-forming mineral hypersthene, contains up to 5 mol.% calcium and exists in three polymorphs, orthorhombic orthoenstatite and protoenstatite and monoclinic clinoenstatite (and the ferrosilite equivalents). Increasing the calcium content prevents the formation of the orthorhombic phases and pigeonite () only crystallises in the monoclinic system. There is not complete solid solution in calcium content and Mg-Fe-Ca pyroxenes with calcium contents between about 15 and 25 mol.% are not stable with respect to a pair of exolved crystals. This leads to a miscibility gap between pigeonite and augite compositions. There is an arbitrary separation between augite and the diopside-hedenbergite () solid solution. The divide is taken at &gt;45 mol.% Ca. As the calcium ion cannot occupy the Y site, pyroxenes with more than 50 mol.% calcium are not possible. A related mineral wollastonite has the formula of the hypothetical calcium end member () but important structural differences mean that it is instead classified as a pyroxenoid.

Magnesium, calcium and iron are by no means the only cations that can occupy the X and Y sites in the pyroxene structure. A second important series of pyroxene minerals are the sodium-rich pyroxenes, corresponding to the &#x27;pyroxene triangle&#x27; nomenclature. The inclusion of sodium, which has a charge of +1, into the pyroxene implies the need for a mechanism to make up the &quot;missing&quot; positive charge. In jadeite and aegirine this is added by the inclusion of a +3 cation (aluminium and iron(III) respectively) on the Y site. Sodium pyroxenes with more than 20 mol.% calcium, magnesium or iron(II) components are known as omphacite and aegirine-augite. With 80% or more of these components the pyroxene is classified using the quadrilateral diagram.

A wide range of other cations that can be accommodated in the different sites of pyroxene structures.

In assigning ions to sites, the basic rule is to work from left to right in this table, first assigning all silicon to the T site and then filling the site with the remaining aluminium and finally iron(III); extra aluminium or iron can be accommodated in the Y site and bulkier ions on the X site.

Not all the resulting mechanisms to achieve charge neutrality follow the sodium example above, and there are several alternative schemes:
#Coupled substitutions of 1+ and 3+ ions on the X and Y sites respectively. For example, Na and Al give the jadeite ) composition.
# Coupled substitution of a 1+ ion on the X site and a mixture of equal numbers of 2+ and 4+ ions on the Y site. This leads to &quot;e.g.,&quot; .
# The Tschermak substitution where a 3+ ion occupies the Y site and a T site leading to &quot;e.g.,&quot; .
In nature, more than one substitution may be found in the same mineral.

<text>Canton is the largest city in Fulton County, Illinois, United States. The population was 13,242 at the 2020 census, down from 14,704 at the 2010 census. The Canton Micropolitan Statistical Area covers all of Fulton County; it is in turn, part of the wider Peoria–Canton, Illinois Combined Statistical Area (CSA).

==Geography==
Canton is located in northeastern Fulton County at . Illinois Routes 9 and 78 pass through the downtown together. IL 9 leads east to Banner near the Illinois River and west to Bushnell, while IL 78 leads north to Farmington and south to Little America in the Illinois River valley.

According to the 2010 census, Canton has a total area of , of which (or 97.98%) is land and (or 2.02%) is water.

==History==
Canton was founded in 1825 by settler Isaac Swan, who believed his new town and Canton, China, were antipodes.

Swan, his infant child, and three other people died in the devastating tornado of June 1835. &quot;Isaac Swan and his child were found in the wreckage of their cabin, the baby dying in its mother&#x27;s arms,&quot; leading some to conclude that the tornado represented divine retribution for the city allowing a circus performance the previous week. The city was hit by a F-3 tornado on July 23, 1975. Two people were killed, and the storm, deemed the 1975 Canton Tornado, caused major damage to the downtown area.

Much of the city, particularly the northern portion, has been undermined by room and pillar extraction of coal that took place in the 1800s. 

Central Illinois Energy, a locally financed cooperative, began planning for a corn-fermentation ethanol plant in 2002. Construction and finance delays resulted in its opening in 2007, approximately south of the city. Beset by financial problems and construction delays on the plant, the cooperative declared bankruptcy. Central Illinois Energy&#x27;s assets were bought by a private company. Construction was completed, and the plant began production in the summer of 2008. It was renamed Riverland Biofuels. 

In December 2008, Cook Medical announced that it would open a new medical device factory at the old International Harvester site. Company owner William &quot;Bill&quot; Cook had grown up in Canton and wanted to do something to help revitalize his home town community. Some of the costs related to Cook Medical were planned to be paid for with state funds: a $750,000 Community Development Assistance Program grant from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity and a $1.1 million grant from the Illinois Department of Transportation for infrastructure improvements near the plant. Scott Eells, the chief operating officer for Cook Group, has said that the factory will eventually be , with more than 300 employees. Bill Cook had previously announced he was buying and renovating several old Canton buildings, including the 1883 Randolph Building on the town square. Cook purchased four buildings in downtown Canton, a shopping center, the site where the International Harvester plant was located as well as constructing the new Canton Harvester Inn boutique hotel and another factory—COOK Polymer. The Lewis Pharmacy Building was purchased and restored. The Randolph Building is another Canton purchase made by Cook. The main floor offers store fronts and there are apartments for rent on the second level. Also purchased is the Fulton Square Shopping Center.

On November 16, 2016, A gas explosion killed an Ameren worker who was fixing a gas leak, sent 12 to the local hospital, and demolished an adjacent building on 1st Avenue that was attached to the Opera House. The next day the Opera House and two other buildings were declared beyond repair and condemned, an additional building declared uninhabitable until repaired, and 48 other buildings noted as damaged but repairable.

==Media==
Canton has a daily newspaper, &quot;The Daily Ledger&quot;, and three radio stations: WBYS and WPZA, and WILP, known as Q98.1. There is also a weekly newspaper, &quot;The Fulton Democrat&quot;, and a weekly shopping publication, &quot;The Independent Shopper&quot;.

==Popular culture==
On September 13, 1967, Los Angeles rock band The Doors played a concert at Canton High School. The Canton audience reportedly reacted with mostly shocked silence at Jim Morrison&#x27;s stage antics.
