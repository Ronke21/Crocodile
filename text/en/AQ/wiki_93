<text>Arkansas City () is a city in Cowley County, Kansas, United States, situated at the confluence of the Arkansas River and Walnut River in the southwestern part of the county. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 11,974.

== Pronunciation of city name ==
The name of this city is not pronounced like the nearby state of Arkansas, but rather as (the final &quot;s&quot; is pronounced, and it rhymes with Kansas). Over the years there has been much confusion about the regional pronunciation of &quot;Arkansas&quot;, which locals render as rather than . Throughout much of Kansas, residents also use this alternative pronunciation when referring to the Arkansas River.

The city is also known as &quot;Ark City&quot;.

== History ==

===Early history===

Present-day Arkansas City sits on the site of an ancestral Wichita city, Etzanoa, which flourished from 1450 to 1700 and had an estimated population of 20,000. 

In 1601, New Mexico Governor Juan de Oñate led an expedition across the Great Plains and found a large settlement of Indians he called Rayados. They lived along the Walnut River in the eastern part of Arkansas City. Extensive remains of Indian settlements have been found along of the Walnut River. The Rayados were the ancestors of the Indians later called Wichita. Wichita settlements from the 18th century are also found a few miles south of Arkansas City on the west bank of the Arkansas River.

===19th century===

European-American settlers first congregated in the area where Arkansas City now stands in the 1860s. 

Settlers established a town in 1870. They had difficulty choosing a name; early names included Adelphia, Creswell, and Walnut City before the present name was chosen. The first post office in Arkansas City was established on May 16, 1870.

In 1877, the Florence, El Dorado, and Walnut Valley Railroad Company built a branch line from Florence to El Dorado, in 1881 it was extended to Douglass, and later to Arkansas City. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to El Dorado was abandoned in 1942. The original branch line connected Florence, Burns, De Graff, El Dorado, Augusta, Douglass, Rock, Akron, Winfield, and Arkansas City.

Arkansas City grew steadily through the latter part of the 19th century, and enjoyed a population explosion starting in 1891, when thousands of people moved into the area in anticipation of the Cherokee Strip Land Run.

===20th century===
At the turn of the century, Arkansas City was a rival to Wichita in size and enterprise, boasting several busy rail lines, an elegant opera house, numerous fine hotels, a manufacturing base and a bustling agricultural economy. A popular swimming hole called Paris Lake was located west of downtown; the lake—and the hot springs at Geuda as well—was mired with silt in a flood about 1919. Nearly 20 years later the WPA would build the Paris Park pool in the same spot. African Americans were not allowed to swim in the Paris Park pool during the era of segregation and used a separate facility colloquially referred to as &quot;the black pool&quot; by local residents.

The Kirkwood Wind Engine Company, a former windmill manufacturer, was headquartered in Arkansas City near the turn of the 20th century; the now-defunct Kanotex Refining Company established a refinery and headquarters in the city in 1917.

During the 1920s, Arkansas City had an active group of Ku Klux Klan. The group was mostly concentrated in south-central and south-east Kansas. The state took action to shut down the group, and most Klans disbanded by 1927.

In 1928, the city&#x27;s official fall festival, Arkalalah, was inaugurated. This annual event still draws thousands of visitors each October, and features a queen, a carnival, dozens of homegrown fair food vendors and a spectacular parade typically lasting two hours or more. During the 1955 Arkalalah celebration, retired Santa Fe steam locomotive 2542 was dedicated in Wilson Park, where it remains today.

The city prospered through much of the 20th century, but by the 1980s, the community was facing economic challenges. The railroads shifted many of their crews to other stops, the old Rodeo meat packing plant, which for a short time was Morrell Meats, closed. The only passenger train that served the city, Amtrak&#x27;s Lone Star, was discontinued. In 1996 Total Petroleum closed their refinery in Ark City with a loss of 170 jobs. By 2003 other large employers in Cowley County closed operations. The Binney &amp; Smith (Crayola) plant closed with a loss of 400 jobs. Winfield State Hospital and Gordon Piatt Industries were closed in nearby Winfield with a combined loss of 973 jobs. Montgomery KONE Elevator and Central Plains Book Manufacturing at nearby Strother Field were also shuttered.

===21st century===
Arkansas City is now home to state-of-the-art meat processor Creekstone Farms Premium Beef LLC which employs over 1100 workers. Several smaller manufacturing companies are expanding their operations while new start ups are finding a home in Cowley County due in part to the workforce supplied by the two local colleges in the county. Both cities, only apart, now have large Wal-Mart stores (a new Wal-Mart Supercenter opened in Arkansas City in March 2006, and another has been constructed in Winfield, Kansas); conversely, both towns&#x27; (in Arkansas City—the Burford, the Howard, and the Crest) movie theaters recently closed and were replaced by a single facility halfway between the cities, just south of the Strother Field industrial park. B &amp; B Theatres donated the two downtown buildings to non-profit organizations in each of the respective communities. The Ark City Burford Theatre and Commercial Building is undergoing a transformation/renovation that will become a new community arts center and gathering space. Construction began in spring 2006 on the planned downtown revitalization streetscape.

In 2006, the local physicians in Arkansas City banded together with the South Central Kansas Regional Medical Center (SCKRMC) board and the City of Arkansas City to build a new hospital, which opened in March 2011.

In 2010, the Keystone-Cushing Pipeline (Phase II) was constructed west of Arkansas City, north to south through Cowley County, with much controversy over tax exemption and environmental concerns (if a leak ever occurs).

In recent years, there have been proposals to extend Amtrak passenger rail service for the &quot;Heartland Flyer&quot; from Oklahoma City to Newton with new stops in Kansas at Arkansas City and Wichita, but it has not been approved yet.

It is located at the junction of U.S. Route 77 and U.S. Route 166, only north of the Kansas-Oklahoma border.

<text>Cambridge is a city in Cowley County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 92.

==History==
Like many communities in Kansas, Cambridge owes its existence to a railroad. When the Kansas City, Lawrence &amp; Southern Railroad was built a mile south of Lazette, a new site was organized by Benjamin H. Clover and plotted on May 3, 1880 and it was named Cambridge after Cambridge University, in England. The first post office in Cambridge was established on January 30, 1880.

On December 15, 1880 the Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway acquired nearly all the stock of the Kansas City, Lawrence &amp; Southern Railroad and operated the railroad awhile as the Southern Kansas Railroad. Cambridge was a station and shipping point on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway.

The Cambridge Public Emergency Radio Tower was mooted as the location for one of two &quot;control stations&quot; of the Decision Information Distribution System, which would be used to alert the public of an enemy attack (the other was to have been in Ault, Colorado.) The control stations would send the &quot;go&quot; signal to ten distribution stations across the country that would then sign on and play taped messages to the public.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. Cambridge is located on US Route 160 at State Highway 7. The community is 45 miles southeast of Wichita.

<text>Dexter is a city in Cowley County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 224.

==History==
The first post office at Dexter was established in July, 1870.

Platted in 1875, Dexter is named for a trotting horse belonging to Robert Bonner of New York.

Early in the 20th century, Dexter became the focus of research that would confirm the existence of an abundance of naturally occurring and readily available helium. In May 1903, a newly drilled natural gas well was found to contain a nonflammable gas. Researchers at the University of Kansas found the “Dexter gas” contained only 15 percent methane and 72 percent nitrogen, causing the gas to be nonflammable. In addition they discovered helium within an “inert residue” in the gas and, after expanding their research to other wells throughout Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma, published a paper in 1907 saying that helium could be extracted from natural gas. Helium did not have any practical applications at the time, but by 1917 the federal government was sponsoring extensive research into the possibility of using helium in airships.

==Geography==

<text>Winfield is a city and county seat of Cowley County, Kansas, United States. It is situated along the Walnut River in South Central Kansas. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 11,777. It is home to Southwestern College.

==History==

===19th century===
Winfield was founded in 1870. It was named for Rev. Winfield Scott, who promised to build the town a church in exchange for the naming rights. The first post office at Winfield was established in May, 1870. In 1873, Winfield incorporated as a city.

====Railroads====
Railroads reached Winfield in the late 1870s, and finished at Arkansas City in 1881. Eventually, a total of five railroads passed through Winfield.

====State mental hospital====
In 1881, the State of Kansas established the Kansas State Asylum for Idiotic and Imbecile Youth, temporarily established at Lawrence, but moved to Winfield in 1887/1888, where it served as a dominant local employer for 117 years.
===20th century===
The Winfield-Arkansas City area became an industrial community in the 20th century, manufacturing consumer goods, and eventually aircraft and aircraft parts, while retaining its traditional dominant employer, the Winfield State Hospital.

On August 13, 1903, 30-year-old Gilbert Twigg, armed with a 12-gauge double-barrelled shotgun, opened fire at a concert, killing six people and wounding at least 25, before killing himself. Three others died in hospitals afterward.

====Strother Field====
In World War II, Winfield, along with neighboring Arkansas City, became home to a military pilot training base, Strother Field, which remained in operation until the end of the war, bringing several thousand military personnel into the area. After the war, in the early 1950s, the field became the shared municipal airport and industrial park for Winfield and neighboring Arkansas City.

====Aviation industry====
The aircraft manufacturing industry in nearby Wichita ( to the north)—one of the world&#x27;s principal aircraft-manufacturing centers—provided employment for many Winfield residents, directly and indirectly. That opportunity grew substantially in the last half of the century, as General Electric&#x27;s GE Aviation division, in the late 1940s, began producing engines for Wichita aircraft, and eventually in the 1960s, one of Wichita&#x27;s principal manufacturers, Cessna Aircraft Company built a factory at Winfield&#x27;s Strother Field.

====Crayola====
The Crayola plant, near Winfield, was established in 1952. At the time, it was the only Crayola plant that made paints. The plant made a large part of the jobs in the county. Tours were conducted until 1992, and 5 years later, in 1997, the plant shut down and the paint making equipment was moved to Pennsylvania. Lots of crayons and memorabilia from the plant can still be seen at the Winfield historical society museum.

====Institutions====
The Winfield State Hospital and Training Center, established in the community in the prior century to house and confine the mentally ill and developmentally disabled, remained as a dominant local employer throughout the 20th century. Towards the end of the century the (now designated &quot;Winfield State Hospital and Training Center&quot;) housed developmentally disabled people. Social, political and legal changes, led to closing of most of the facility in 1998. It was gradually turned into the Winfield Correctional Facility.

Southwestern College grew to become a leading local institution and employer, drawing students from throughout the central United States, and bringing an extra level of intellectual and cultural development and diversity to the community.

Pi Gamma Mu International Honor Society in Social Sciences was founded at Southwestern College in Winfield in 1924. The international headquarters is now housed at a repurposed Carnegie Library building on Millington Street in downtown Winfield. Pi Gamma Mu is the oldest and preeminent interdisciplinary social science honor society. Its mission is to encourage and promote excellence in the Social Sciences and to uphold and nurture scholarship, leadership, and service.

===21st century===
In the 21st century, Winfield remained an industrial and institutional town. With the exception of Cessna, most of the area&#x27;s major employers (some under new names and ownership) continued into the early 21st century.

==Geography==
Winfield is situated along the Walnut River at its confluence with Timber Creek. It is located north of the Kansas-Oklahoma state border at the junction of U.S. Routes 77 and 160.

K-360 is a bypass around the southeastern part of the city between U.S. Route 77 and U.S. Route 160. Arkansas City is south of Winfield along U.S. Route 77, and Strother Field, a general aviation airport, is approximately five miles (8 km) south.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

==Economy==
===19th century===
====Railroads====
In 1877, the Florence, El Dorado, and Walnut Valley Railroad Company built a branch line from Florence to El Dorado. The line was extended to Douglass then reached Winfield on October 1, 1879, and finished at Arkansas City in 1881. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to El Dorado was abandoned in 1942. The original branch line connected Florence, Burns, De Graff, El Dorado, Augusta, Douglass, Rock, Akron, Winfield, Arkansas City.

The Southern Kansas and Western Railroad was completed from the east to Winfield on February 17, 1880, then continued westward, and it reached the western county line on March 16. This railroad changed its name over time as it merged or purchased by other railroads.

Eventually, a total of five railroads passed through Winfield.

====State mental hospital====
In 1881, The Kansas Constitution stated that the care, treatment, and education of the handicapped were responsibilities of public residential institutions. Accordingly, the Kansas State Asylum for Idiotic and Imbecile Youth was temporarily established at Lawrence, moving to Winfield in 1887.

The Kansas State Imbecile Asylum (later the Winfield State Hospital and Training Center) was established in the community in 1888, on a hill overlooking the city. For the next 117 years, it served as a dominant local employer, housing and confining those with mental problems from throughout the state of Kansas.

===20th century===
====Industry====
The Winfield-Arkansas City area has a wide range of industrial employers—most of which emerged and developed in the 20th century. Many are based at, and around, Strother Field—a municipal airport that the two cities share.

=====Consumer goods=====
In 1916, Gott Manufacturing was established in Winfield to produce metal water coolers. Over the next 70 years, the enterprise grew into a major supplier of insulated water jugs and urns.

In 1986, Gott was acquired by Rubbermaid, a globally dominant manufacturer of rubber storage containers, and converted to producing Rubbermaid-branded products, manufacturing insulated water coolers, ice chests, outdoor-living and outdoor-storage products. Subsequent expansion of its facilities have continued into the present day.

A Crayola crayon-manufacturing plant was located in Winfield from 1952 to 1997.

=====Aviation industry=====
======Strother Field======
In 1942, as America entered World War II, Winfield, along with neighboring Arkansas City, began development of a shared municipal airport. However, the entry of the U.S. into the war led to military acquisition and completion of the airfield, which became Strother Field. During the war, the airfield was used for military pilot training.

In 1953, the airport reverted to shared control of Winfield and Arkansas City, and became a major industrial center for both communities, which it remains to the present.

======GE Aviation======
In 1951, at Strother Field, GE Aviation—an aircraft-engine division of General Electric—began producing General Electric J47 jet engines for U.S. military aircraft (notably the Boeing B-47 Stratojet intercontinental bomber, built primarily in Wichita, and also built by Douglas Aircraft at Tulsa in neighboring Oklahoma). Approximately 3,000 of those engines were produced at Strother by 1955.

With the end of the Korean War, the GE factory switched to overhauling jet engine parts and accessories. In 1962, GE began overhauling and repairing entire military jet engines (particularly J73 and J85), and related parts and accessories—ultimately processing over 6,000 jet engines between 1962 and 1975.

With the advent of business jets in the mid-1960s—led by Wichita&#x27;s Learjet (using General Electric CJ-610 engines, also used on other business aircraft)—the Strother Field GE facility switched to servicing GE&#x27;s business jet engines, ultimately processing over 6,000 by 1975, as the factory grew to 125,000 square feet. During those years, several hundred business jets, from around the world, flew into Strother Field to be serviced directly at the GE facility.

Subsequently, GE&#x27;s Strother facility overhauled J33 military engines, and General Electric CF6 engines for &quot;jumbo&quot; jetliners.

In 1985, GE acquired much of the abandoned Cessna facility for use in its engine-overhaul enterprise.

======Cessna======
In 1967, Cessna Aircraft Company, the world&#x27;s highest-volume producer of aircraft (mostly light aircraft, at the time) addressed booming demand for their smallest, most-popular aircraft, by opening a Cessna factory at Strother Field. Initially, the factory produced the Cessna 150, at that time the world&#x27;s most popular two-seat light aircraft (the world&#x27;s dominant pilot-training aircraft for several decades).

In 1975, Cessna also began to move the assembly of the world&#x27;s most popular light aircraft, the Cessna 172, from its Wichita factory to Strother Field.

Several thousand of both aircraft models were produced at Strother Field (making it a globally major aircraft factory complex, in total unit production). The factory employed several hundred to a few thousand workers until the 1980s Recession and other factors crashed the market for light aircraft, and Cessna, following layoffs of 700 workers at Strother Field, eventually shut down the Strother Field factory in the early 1980s.

====Institutions====
The Winfield State Hospital and Training Center, established in the community in the prior century to house and confine the mentally ill and developmentally disabled, remained as a dominant local employer throughout the 20th century, housing and confining those with mental problems from throughout the state of Kansas—housing up to 1,492 &quot;patients&quot; at its maximum in 1952.

Towards the end of the century the (now designated &quot;Winfield State Hospital and Training Center&quot;) housed developmentally disabled people. Changing social and political attitudes, and SCOTUS decisions, and conservative political economics (developmentally disabled persons supported in the community cost the state $25,000 annually, versus $130,000 for confinement in the Winfield facility), led to the gradual closing of most of the facility—over heated protests from residents&#x27; families and local community leaders. In 1998, the Kansas Legislature officially voted to close it. At that time, it was the oldest and largest of the three Kansas state hospitals for developmentally disabled persons. When the closure of the facility was announced in 1997, the patient population had declined to only 250 residents.

The facility was gradually taken over by the Kansas Department of Corrections, and repurposed as the Winfield Correctional Facility, expanded to contain up to 556 prisoners.

===21st century===
With the exception of Cessna, most of the area&#x27;s major employers (some under new names and ownership) continued into the early 21st century. The Strother Field municipal airport remains the site of the area&#x27;s principal industrial park, employing thousands.

In 2010, the Keystone-Cushing Pipeline (Phase II) was constructed west of Winfield, north to south through Cowley County, with much controversy over tax exemption and environmental concerns (if a leak ever occurs).

In 2011–2012, Rubbermaid (now Newell Rubbermaid) announced it was moving 200 jobs from a Texas factory to Winfield, increasing its Winfield capacity to add manufacturing of Rubbermaid&#x27;s trash cans and home-organization products. Further, Rubbermaid would invest $26.6 million to expand its operations, beginning construction of a 500,000-square-foot distribution center next to its factory. In early 2017, the company was employing 1,054 people

GE Aviation, which began Winfield operations in 1947, continued, generally, until the present day, (according to a local government statement online in April 2017), now employing 750 people in the area.

Creekstone Farms beef processing plant, in neighboring Arkansas City, Kansas, employed over 600 in early 2017.

Hospitals and nursing-care facilities in Winfield and Arkansas City, combined, employed over 600 workers in early 2017—about half at William Newton Memorial Hospital in Winfield.

The Winfield Correctional Facility employed another 200.

==Arts and culture==

===Entertainment===
Winfield is well known for hosting the Walnut Valley Festival, one of the nation&#x27;s oldest and largest bluegrass and acoustic music festivals, on the third weekend of every September. Crowds have exceeded 15,000, arriving from around the nation—with hundreds of the bluegrass and acoustic music enthusiasts camping, socializing and &quot;jamming&quot; at the site for weeks before the festival begins. The event also often features folk music and Celtic music performances, and related cultural activities and exhibits.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary education===
The community is served by Winfield USD 465 public school district, which operates Winfield High School.

===College===
Southwestern College is located in Winfield. It is a four-year private higher educational institution affiliated with the United Methodist Church.

St. John&#x27;s College was located in Winfield before it closed in 1986.

That Labor Day weekend marked the end of nearly four years of devastation, loss and sacrifice for the nation. More than 300,000 Americans in the armed services died in Europe and the Pacific arenas.

<doc id="114509" wikidata="Q2232013" url="?curid=114509" title="Girard, Kansas">
<text>Girard is a city in and the county seat of Crawford County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 2,496.

== History ==
Girard was founded in the spring of 1868, in opposition to Crawfordsville, and named after the town of Girard, Pennsylvania, the former home of trustee Charles Strong. It was based around the surveyed line of the Kansas City, Fort Scott and Gulf Railroad, in an attempt to gain an advantage over its rival.

The first post office in Girard was established in September 1868.

The first celebration in Girard occurred on July 4, 1868, marking Sunday school and Independence Day. Under a law passed in March 1871, Girard became a city of the third class. In early April the first city officers were elected. The last meeting of the trustees was held April 5, and the first meeting of the new Council was held on April 7.

===Banks===
Franklin Playter started the first bank in Girard in June, 1871. In 1872, he erected for the accommodation of his business a two-story brick building, the first brick building in the city. In June, 1879, this bank was succeeded by the Bank of Girard, established by E. R. Moffit. The Bank of Girard was succeeded in 1882 by the Girard Bank.

===Mills===
The Girard Mills were built in 1870, and began operations in the spring of 1871. The first building was a -story frame, costing, with the machinery and power, $10,000. The property was owned by Tontz &amp; Hitz. In 1879, Tontz retired from active participation in the management of the business, In 1882 he sold his interest to Hitz, who erected a -story brick mill, put in five run of buhrs, and two sets of Gray&#x27;s patent rollers, making it a combined mill.
The Crawford County Mills were built in 1870 by a stock company. These mills are two and a half stories high, contain three run of buhrs and one set of rollers, thus being also a combined mill, and the machinery is propelled by a twenty-five horse-power engine.
===Mining===
Carbon Creek was the location of the first mining camp of the county. No shafts were sunk at first, but several strip pits were opened. From the strip pits, slopes were run along the veins, and coal operations opened on a small scale. By 1877 perhaps one hundred miners were working along Carbon Creek, getting out coal.

In the 1960s many of the mines closed. Today the landscape of southeastern Crawford County is covered with long strip mines now full of water and serving as fishing lakes &amp; unfarmed wildlife habitat. The ruins of abandoned zinc and lead smelters can also be seen; many are Superfund sites polluted with the toxic remains of smelter operations. The economy that was driven by industrialized mining and smelting during the first half of the 20th century in the early 21st century is dominated by agriculture.

===Immigration===
With the growth of the mining industry in Crawford County, large numbers of immigrants from Southern Europe and the Balkans were brought in to work in the mines. These immigrants were more often adherents of Catholicism in contrast to the generally Protestant population previously in the county. At the time this created social tension but today Crawford county celebrates its South European heritage with the annual &quot;Little Balkan Days&quot; event.

To dig the coal, the city began a concentrated effort to attract coal miners from other areas of the United States and from the coal-producing nations of Europe. Overseas, broadsides were distributed along the Mediterranean, promising prosperity in the coal fields of southeast Kansas. Steamship companies sent agents throughout Europe to recruit workers, underwriting one-way passage. From 1880 through 1915, huge waves of immigrants came to southeast Kansas. In all, over fifty nationalities came to mine coal and work in the area&#x27;s smelters and other industries.

===Socialism in Girard===
In the first decades of the 20th century, Girard became a hub of socialist politics. Populist Percy Daniels, whose farm was nearby in Crawford Township, briefly owned the &quot;Girard Herald&quot; and used it to promote his views; he was elected lieutenant governor in 1892. In 1896, Julius Wayland moved to Girard from Kansas City, Missouri and brought with him his socialist periodical &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot;. In 1900 he employed Fred Warren as his co-editor. Warren was a well-known figure on the left and managed to persuade some of America&#x27;s leading progressives to contribute to the &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot;.

In 1904, Warren commissioned Upton Sinclair to write a novel about immigrant workers in the Chicago meat-packing houses. Wayland provided Sinclair with a $500 advance and after seven weeks&#x27; research, he wrote the novel, &quot;The Jungle&quot;. Serialized in 1905, the book helped to increase circulation of the newspaper to 175,000. After the book was published by Doubleday in 1906, the popularity of the &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot; increased, as did the attacks on Wayland and Warren. The phenomenal success of Wayland&#x27;s newspaper meant that he developed a printing plant capable of handling a weekly newspaper of huge circulation; on occasion more than 400,000 copies per week were printed. The Appeal to Reason Company issued hundreds of other socialist publications in addition to the Appeal, making the Girard, Kansas name known.
During the decade of the 1900s, Eugene V. Debs lived in Girard and worked on the &quot;Appeal&quot;. He was the Social Democratic Party candidate for President of the United States in the election of 1900. He ran for President again on the Socialist Party of America ticket in 1904, 1908, and 1912. Debs received 901,000 votes in the election of 1912 (6% of the vote). In 1908, he kicked off his campaign for president from the steps of the Crawford County courthouse in Girard. In 1912 he carried Crawford County (one of four counties he carried nationwide).

During World War I, Debs was a subject of efforts by President Wilson to suppress dissent against the war. He was convicted of violating the Smith Espionage Act and, in September 1918, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. In 1920 he ran for President while still incarcerated in the Atlanta Penitentiary. He received 919,799 votes (3.4% of the vote) despite being imprisoned. President Warren G. Harding pardoned Debs in December 1921.

In 1915 Emanuel Julius was invited to move to Girard and write for &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot;, then the largest socialist periodical in the country. Julius married Marcet Haldeman in 1916. At the suggestion of Marcet&#x27;s aunt, Jane Addams of Hull House, both assumed the surname Haldeman-Julius. In 1919, Emanuel became co-owner and editor of &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot; and began printing the first of the small paperback books in Girard which soon became the foundation for his Little Blue Books series. His vision was to make good literature available to the masses at a cheap price. At the end of nine years, the small project had become a gigantic publishing venture; Emanuel Haldeman-Julius became known as &quot;the Henry Ford of literature&quot;. Following World War II, the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover viewed the Little Blue Books&#x27; inclusion of such subjects as socialism, atheism, and frank treatment of sexuality as a threat; Haldeman-Julius was added to the enemies list. This caused a rapid decline in the number of bookstores carrying the Little Blue Books.

Emanuel Haldeman-Julius died July 31, 1951, at his home in Girard. He was found drowned in his own swimming pool by his second wife of nine years, Sue Haldeman-Julius. The Little Blue Books continued to be reprinted after Haldeman-Julius&#x27; death. They were sold by mail order by his son until 1978, when the Girard printing plant and warehouse were destroyed by fire.

;Newspapers
The &quot;Girard Press&quot; was moved by Warner and Wasser from Fort Scott to Girard in November, 1869, the first issue appearing at the latter place on the 11th of the month. The paper took strong ground in favor of the validity of Mr. Joy&#x27;s title to the neutral lands, and on this account its office and material were set fire to on July 14, 1871, and destroyed. The loss was $4,000. New material was obtained, and the paper, enlarged and improved, re-appeared August 13, and was later published as a nine-column folio weekly.

&quot;Girard Press&quot; ceased publication in September 2008.

&quot;Hometown Girard&quot; launched on February 15, 2013 and is published bi-weekly (every two weeks).

<text>Pittsburg is a city in Crawford County, Kansas, United States, located in southeast Kansas near the Missouri state border. It is the most populous city in Crawford County and southeast Kansas. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 20,646. It is the home of Pittsburg State University.

==History==
On October 23, 1864, a wagon train of refugees had come from Fort Smith, Arkansas, and was escorted by troops from the 6th Kansas Cavalry under the command of Col. William Campbell. These were local men from Cherokee, Crawford, and Bourbon counties. Their enlistment was over, and they were on their way to Fort Leavenworth to be dismissed from service. They ran into the 1st Indian Brigade led by Maj. Andrew Jackson Piercy near the current Pittsburg Waste Water Treatment Plant. They continued to the north when a small group of wagons broke away in an unsuccessful rush to safety. The Confederate troops caught up with them and burned the wagons. The death toll was three Union soldiers and 13 civilian men who had been with the wagon train. It was likely that one of the Confederates had also been killed. A granite marker memorial for the &quot;Cow Creek Skirmish&quot; was placed near the Crawford County Historical Museum on October 30, 2011.

Pittsburg sprang up in the fall of 1876 on a railroad line being built through the neighborhood. It was named after Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and maps of the time give the town&#x27;s name as &quot;New Pittsburgh&quot;. George Hobson and Franklin Playter are credited with being the city&#x27;s founders, establishing a government after its beginnings as a coal mining camp in the 1870s. The city was incorporated in 1879. The “New” was dropped upon incorporation of the city as a third class city on June 21, 1880, with M. M. Snow as its first Mayor. In 1892 it was advanced to a city of the second class, in 1905 Pittsburg attained the rank of first class.

The first dwelling was built by J. T. Roach in July 1876. The first post office in Pittsburg was established in August, 1876. The post office&#x27;s name was shortened from &quot;New Pittsburgh&quot; to &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; in 1881 and to &quot;Pittsburg&quot; in 1894. The latter renaming came after the United States Board on Geographic Names, in the interest of standardization, recommended that the &#x27;h&#x27; be dropped from place names ending in &quot;burgh&quot;.

Pittsburg is the home to Pittsburg State University, founded in 1903 as a normal training institution. Through the years the college became more diversified in its aims and goals, so that it became a multi-purpose institution. It has always had a strong manual and industrial arts program and has trained many of the area&#x27;s public and private school teachers.

In 1879, two miners from Joplin began the first commercial attempts at mining in close proximity of Broadway Street. A relic of the city&#x27;s coal mining days was the Pittsburg &amp; Midway Coal Company, founded in 1885, and one of the oldest continuously running coal companies in the United States (even though its headquarters moved several years ago to Denver, Colorado after the Kansas mines closed). In September 2007, Chevron which owned the company, merged it with its Molycorp Inc. coal mining division to form Chevron Mining, thus ending the Pittsburg corporate name. Midway referred to a coal camp in eastern Crawford County, Kansas that was &quot;midway&quot; between Baxter Springs, Kansas and Fort Scott, Kansas. Kenneth A. Spencer, whose father was among the founders of the company was to play an important role in Kansas and Missouri philanthropy.

Pittsburg was also the most heavily unionized city in Kansas at the beginning of the 20th century. In addition to some coal mining, the economic base of the city now rests on industry.

The city has a rich cultural heritage from many Southern and Eastern European mine workers who settled in and around Pittsburg and Southeastern Kansas. It is situated in a once productive coal field. It now relies heavily on education and government-related employment.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. Pittsburg sits in the Ozark Highlands region, a mix of prairie and forests.

It lies west of Springfield, Missouri, south of Kansas City, Missouri, and northeast of Tulsa, Oklahoma.

===Climate===
Pittsburg has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) bordering on a hot-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;). Summers are hot and humid, with as many as 73 mornings per year staying above and eight mornings remaining above – indeed in July 2012 the temperature did not fall below . The hottest morning, however, was on August 10, 2006 when the temperature did not fall below , and the hottest temperature has been on July 13 and 14, 1954. Heavy thunderstorm rains often punctuate the heat with heavy rainfall: fell on July 30, 2013. Periods of hot weather without much rain are not uncommon: only trace precipitation fell between July 28 and September 10, 2000, and only between July 7 and August 20, 1984.

During the fall season, temperatures cool off fairly rapidly: the last temperature can be expected on September 22, and by the end of October temperatures have usually fallen to a comfortable level. Heavy rainfall from frontal systems or remnant tropical storms are common during this period: the wettest day with was on September 25, 1993, a year which saw between April and September as against only during the same period in 1980. September 1993 was also the wettest month on record with , while the wettest calendar year overall has been 1985 with and the driest 1963 with only .

As with all of Kansas, winter weather is extremely variable, although extreme maxima are not as hot as in the southwest of the state as Pittsburg is far from the influence of hot chinook winds. Arctic outbreaks bring temperatures to or below on average once per winter, while maxima over can be expected four times between December and February. Winter weather is less dry than in most of Kansas since moist Gulf air often penetrates without reaching most of the state: December 2015 saw of rain, and the very cold January 1979 saw sixteen days with at least of measurable precipitation. Because the moister air masses are warm, heavy snowfall is uncommon in Pittsburg: the mean is and only twelve months have seen more than , with the most in a month being in January 1979. The most snow in a day has been on December 13, 2000, and the most snow on the ground on February 4 and 5, 2011 and March 17, 1970.

Spring weather is changeable and often suspect to severe storms: Pittsburg lies in the heart of “Tornado Alley”. The changeable weather from hot to cold can be accompanied by frequent heavy precipitation: Pittsburg can expect of precipitation between March and June, approximately what Dodge City or Liberal further west receive in a whole year. Temperatures warm up during the spring: the first temperature of can be expected on March 27, but the first of does not normally occur until May 28.

<text>Abilene (pronounced ) is a city in and the county seat of Dickinson County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 6,460. It is home of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library and the Greyhound Hall of Fame.

==History==
===19th century===
In 1803, most of modern Kansas was secured by the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state.

In 1857, Dickinson County was founded and Abilene began as a stage coach stop, established by Timothy Hersey and named Mud Creek. It was not until 1860 that it was named Abilene, from a passage in the Bible (Luke 3:1), meaning &quot;grassy plains&quot;.

In 1867, the Kansas Pacific Railway (Union Pacific) pushed westward through Abilene. In the same year, Joseph G. McCoy purchased 250 acres of land north and east of Abilene, on which he built a hotel, the Drover&#x27;s Cottage, stockyards equipped for 2,000 heads of cattle, and a stable for their horses. The Kansas Pacific put in a spur line at Abilene that enabled the cattle cars to be loaded and sent on to their destinations. The first twenty carloads left September 5, 1867, en route to Chicago, Illinois, where McCoy was familiar with the market. The town grew quickly and became the first &quot;cow town&quot; of the west.

McCoy encouraged Texas cattlemen to drive their herds to his stockyards. From 1867 to 1871, the Chisholm Trail ended in Abilene, bringing in many travelers and making Abilene one of the wildest towns in the west. The stockyards shipped 35,000 head in 1867 and became the largest stockyards west of Kansas City, Kansas. In 1871, more than 5,000 cowboys herded from 600,000 to 700,000 cows to Abilene and other Kansas railheads. Another source reports 440,200 head of cattle were shipped out of Abilene from 1867 to 1871. As railroads were built further south, the end of the Chisholm Trail was slowly moved south toward Caldwell, while Kansas homesteaders concerned with cattle ruining their farm crops moved the trail west toward and past Ellsworth.

Town marshal Tom &quot;Bear River&quot; Smith was initially successful policing Abilene, often using only his bare hands. He survived two assassination attempts, but was murdered and decapitated on November 2, 1870. Smith wounded one of his two attackers during the shootout preceding his death, and both suspects received life in prison for the offense. He was replaced as marshal by Wild Bill Hickok in April 1871. Hickok&#x27;s time in the job was short. While the marshal was standing off a crowd during a street brawl, gambler Phil Coe took two shots at Hickok, who returned fire, killing Coe, but Hickok then accidentally shot his friend and deputy, Mike Williams, who was coming to his aid. Hickok lost his job two months later in December.

In 1880, Conrad Lebold built the Lebold Mansion. Lebold was one of the early town developers and bankers from 1869 through 1889. The Hersey dugout can still be seen in the cellar. The house is now a private residence. A marker outside credits the name of the town being given by opening a Bible and using the first place name pointed to.

In 1887, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway built a branch line from Neva ( west of Strong City) through Abilene to Superior, Nebraska. In 1996, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway merged with Burlington Northern Railroad and renamed to the current BNSF Railway. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the Santa Fe.

In 1890, Dr. A.B. Seelye founded the A.B. Seelye Medical Company. Seelye developed over 100 products for the company including &quot;Wasa-Tusa&quot;, an Indian name meaning &quot;to heal&quot;.

===20th century===

Abilene became home to Dwight D. Eisenhower when his family moved to Abilene from Denison, Texas in 1892. Eisenhower attended elementary school through high school in Abilene, graduating in 1909. The Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library and Museum is the burial site of President Eisenhower, his wife, Mamie, and their first-born son Doud Dwight.

==Geography==
Abilene is on the north side of the Smoky Hill River in the Flint Hills region of the Great Plains. Mud Creek, a tributary of the Smoky Hill, flows south through the city. Located in North Central Kansas at the intersection of Interstate 70 and K-15, Abilene is approximately east of Salina, Kansas, north of Wichita, and west of Kansas City.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , all land.

===Climate===
Located in the transition zone between North America&#x27;s humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) and humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;) zones, Abilene experiences hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters. In the spring, severe thunderstorms bring the threat of tornadoes and hail. The hottest temperature recorded in Abilene was on July 13, 1954 and July 15, 1954, while the coldest temperature recorded was on February 12, 1899.

==Economy==
Abilene remains a cattle yard town, loading onto the rail system, along with grain and other crops.

Cowboy-era Abilene is the fictional setting for the Randolph Scott-starring 1946 film &quot;Abilene Town&quot;, which in turn became the inspiration behind the 1963 hit song &quot;Abilene&quot;, recorded by George Hamilton IV.

British singer-songwriter John Cale&#x27;s song &quot;Buffalo Ballet&quot; from his 1975 album &quot;Fear&quot; reflects a cynical view of the town&#x27;s history from the days it was &quot;young and gay&quot; until it &quot;drowned in wealth and pain&quot;, as an example of the expansion of the American Frontier.

<text>Chapman is a city in Dickinson County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 1,377.

==History==
The first settlement was made at Chapman in 1868, and the same year Jackman&#x27;s mill was built on Chapman Creek, a little northeast of the present town. James Streeter and S. M. Strickler laid out the town in 1871. It was named after the Chapman Creek.

The first post office at Chapman was established in 1866, but the post office was given the name Chapman&#x27;s Creek until 1872.

===2008 tornado===

On the evening of June 11, 2008, a ½-mile wide tornado swept through Chapman. The tornado moved from the southwest side of town, through the central business district, and then on out of town. Many buildings and structures in the town were extensively damaged; most of the downtown area was obliterated and over 60 homes were destroyed. At least one person was confirmed dead in early reports. The American Red Cross estimated that 75 percent of homes had major damage or were destroyed. School buildings and churches took extensive damage and at least 200 people were displaced from the town.

Sharon Watson, public affairs director for the Kansas Army National Guard, said the damage was &quot;very reminiscent of Greensburg&quot;, a small city in southwestern Kansas that was similarly damaged during the tornado outbreak of May 4–6, 2007.

===&quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot;===
On January 23, 2009, Friday, in the episode &quot;Tutwiler Family&quot; (2009) of &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot;, the show helped rebuild their lives and homes. In the episode, the show arrived to assist an Iraq War veteran, his wife and their four young children, who were among those left homeless by the tornado. In addition to rebuilding the Tutwiler home, a coalition of builders, volunteers, and crew of &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot; helped neighbors with furniture and some rebuilding, and they built the town&#x27;s first community center that could also be used as a safe shelter for tornado protection. By the end of 2009, the Tutwiler family had placed their house on the market, saying they wanted to leave the town of Chapman, citing &quot;scrutiny and ill feelings&quot; from several Chapman residents who claimed the family did not deserve the makeover had made residing in their new home extremely difficult. The Tutweilers have since relocated to an army base in Texas. Later that year the house was sold.

===2016 tornado===
On May 25, 2016, a large tornado tore southwest of Chapman, which was placed under a tornado emergency. The violent and long-lived wedge tornado was on the ground for and lasted for at least 90 minutes, producing at least mid-range EF4 damage at its most intense point. While officially rated mid-range EF4, NWS Topeka damage surveyors noted that based on the damage that occurred in rural areas, an EF5 rating may have been necessary had the tornado hit any towns directly. The tornado began to weaken as it passed south of Chapman, causing extensive tree damage and inflicting low-end EF3 damage to a large farm house. To the southeast of Chapman, a home was shifted off its foundation at EF1 intensity before the tornado dissipated shortly after 8:30 p.m. The tornado reached a maximum width of one half-mile wide along its path, and damaged or destroyed roughly 20 homes in Dickinson County. No fatalities were incurred, but eight people suffered minor injuries as a result of this tornado.

<text>Enterprise is a city in Dickinson County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 708.

==History==
The first settlement at Enterprise was in 1868, and Enterprise was laid out in 1872. It was named for the enterprising qualities of the pioneer settlers.

The first post office in Enterprise was established in January 1873.

On January 10, 1883, the Enterprise Town Company, with capital of $50,000, was organized. The following officers were elected: V. P. Wilson, president; John Johntz, vice-president; C. Hoffman, treasurer; T. C. Henry, secretary.

In 1867, the Kansas Pacific Railroad reached Dickinson County, and the KP built a spur to connect Enterprise with the mainline at Detroit, three miles away. In 1886, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad built a tertiary line through Enterprise to connect the Rock Island&#x27;s main line at Herington to the grain elevators and flour mills in Salina. Today, that track is still in use, owned by the Abilene and Smoky Valley, a heritage railroad that runs excursion trains between Abilene and Enterprise. In 1887, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway built a branch line from Neva (three miles west of Strong City) through Enterprise to Superior, Nebraska. In 1996, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway merged with Burlington Northern Railroad and renamed to the current BNSF Railway. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Santa Fe&quot;.

<text>Hope is a city in southern Dickinson County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 317.

==History==

===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land that became the state of Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1857, Dickinson County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included what became Hope.

===Development===
In 1871, a group of about forty people, led by Newell Thurstin, began planning a townsite, named Hope after one of his sons. Its first post office was established in July 1871.

David Jacob Eisenhower, the father of President Dwight David Eisenhower, lived in a ranch near Hope from 1878 until his enrollment at Lane University in Lecompton, and then he moved to Hope. On March 30, 1885, he and business partner Milton Good opened a general store in Hope called Good &amp; Eisenhower, operated mostly by the Eisenhower family, and &quot;balanced to the penny&quot; by Eisenhower&#x27;s mandate. The partners were leading civic boosters for Hope for years, with the community development mostly led by Good and the socially reclusive Eisenhower co-funding some projects.

Hope was incorporated in 1886, with a population over 700. The arrival of the railroad one year before, brought access of bustling Chicago to tiny Hope. In early 1886, Eisenhower and Good organized a fundraiser among businesses to open an opera house in Hope. On November 4, 1886, Eisenhower bought out their partnership of one and a half years.

In 1887, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway built a branch line from Neva (3 miles west of Strong City) through Hope to Superior, Nebraska. In 1996, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway merged with Burlington Northern Railroad and renamed to the current BNSF Railway.

In late 1888, Good abandoned Hope, and the Eisenhower family continued the store. The Eisenhowers reported Good&#x27;s &quot;misdeeds&quot; to have caused the later failure of the store and his departure to have been &quot;in something of a hurry&quot;, but historians&#x27; research has improved Good&#x27;s retrospective reputation.

The motto of Hope is &quot;There Will Always Be Hope In Kansas&quot;, which is also the name of a song.

<text>Woodbine is a city in Dickinson County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 157.

==History==

For millennia, the land Kansas was inhabited by Native Americans. In 1803, most of modern Kansas was secured by the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1857, Dickinson County was founded.

The city was founded as Lyons, named for the nearby creek, in 1871 by James Allen Gillett Sr. The first post office at Woodbine was established in January, 1872. In 1887, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad built through the area and Lyons was remapped as Woodbine on July 16, 1887. Gillett renamed it Woodbine after his former hometown of Woodbine, Illinois.

Along the railroad tracks, Woodbine had a grist mill, grain elevator, depot, and stock yards. Passenger service was offered until 1927 and freight was discontinued in the 1990s. Several bus lines served Woodbine after rail service ended. The town was home to the Woodbine Journal during World War I.

Woodbine at one time had four churches: Lutheran, Baptist, and English and German Methodist. The school was opened in 1880 with its existing building being built in 1909. High school classes began in 1914. Woodbine District #32 became Woodbine Rural High School District #1 (parts of Dickinson and Morris counties) in 1925 and the last graduating class was in 1962. Lower grades continued until 1979. Woodbine is a part of the Rural Vista USD 481 public school district.

The Rock Island served the area for many years until the company ceased operation in 1980. The track was then used by various rail lines until being abandoned in the mid-1990s. While part of the line was scrapped, the remaining track from Abilene to Woodbine has been purchased by the Abilene and Smoky Valley Railroad.

<text>Highland is a city in Doniphan County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 903. It is home to Highland Community College.

==History==

=== Short summary ===
The Highland Township was started with the founding of the Iowa and Sac &amp; Fox Mission State Historic Site by Reverend Samuel Irvin and Reverend William Hamilton in 1837. The mission was sponsored and funded by the Presbyterians. The Founders plan behind the town was to make it an educational town and in 1857 when the town was laid out a spot was chosen for the future university. Samuel Irvin established the first Highland Community College Building Irvin Hall with the building being built in 1858. The college was chartered and founded in 1858 and has gone through eight name changes over the course of its history.

In 2011 Highland became the self proclaimed Snowflake City of Kansas

=== Early history ===
Reverend Samuel Irvin and Reverend William Hamilton found the Ioway Presbtaryian Church in 1843 with Rev. Hamilton acting as Minister. The church was moved from the Mission to Highland in 1860. John Powers Johnson builds a log home 2 miles west of the mission in 1854 due to land unavailability along the Missouri River. The Cabin was the first Building in Highland sitting on the site of the current Senior Citizen Center. Johnson left Kansas for two years as he didn&#x27;t have to live in the home he only had to make improvements to the land in order to purchase it under the Preemption Act of 1841 he however could not purchase the land until after the Iowa tribe members had been removed and the land had been surveyed. John Bayless preempted the land just west of Johnson and founded the Susquehanna western Immigration Company to promote anti-slavery people moving to Kansas. Samuel Irvin looked over the claims till the land could properly be purchased in 1857.

=== The Highland Town Company ===
On May 16, 1857, the Highland Town Company was formed buying town lots to resell to what they had hoped to be a bustling town. Bayless was the Company&#x27;s president with Johnson acting as Secretary and Irvin as the treasurer. The town company had built some amenities such as a large hotel despite slow growth. The town struggled to gain population but despite its small size the town had a newspaper called The Highlander and the first bank arrived by 1862 being opened by Johnson. These three founding fathers hoped that Highland would become not only an educational center but also a religious center for Kansas and surrounding territories. In November 1857 the Highland Presbytery was organized as part of the Missouri Synod and eventually came to encompass all 21 old school presbyteries in the Kansas and Nebraska territories.

=== Highland University ===
At the first meeting of the presbytery, it was decided by the members that a Presbyterian academy would be established in highland. On December 26, 1857, the board had decided that the academy which could be compared to a private high school was not sufficient and voted to established Highland University instead with James Cambell as president and Samuel Irvin as Secretary. The board of trustees prepared a charter that was taken to Lecompton the Territorial capital of Kansas and was passed and signed by Governor Denver on February 9, 1858. Highland Town Company then reserved 4 blocks on the west side of town for the University. Elementary classes were held at the college until a Grade school was opened in the mid 1870s.

==History==
===Early history===
Baldwin City began as a trail stop on the Santa Fe Trail named Palmyra. The small community consisted of a harness shop, blacksmith, hotel, lawyer, drug store, two doctors and a tavern. In 1858, a group of Methodist ministers gathered at Kibbee Cabin and founded Baker University. Palmyra bought land to the south for the university and surrounding city. The first post office was established in June, 1857.

A main benefactor of the community was John Baldwin and the town was named in his honor. Baldwin built a saw mill which was at present-day Fifth and Indiana Streets. Baldwin City was incorporated on September 22, 1870.

Baldwin City unwittingly found themselves surrounded by the events that led up to the American Civil War. Three miles east of Baldwin was the town site of Black Jack where the Battle of Black Jack took place on June 2, 1856. The night before that battle, John Brown stayed in Prairie City. In 1863, Quantrill&#x27;s raiders passed within three miles (5 km) of Baldwin after the burning of Lawrence.

Midland&#x27;s Scout program is one of the few in the country to offer a railroading merit badge and Midland has hosted a Thomas the Tank Engine attraction the last few years.

<text>Eudora is a city in Douglas County, Kansas, United States, along the Kansas and Wakarusa rivers. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 6,408.

== History ==
The Eudora area was home to various Native American tribes for thousands of years. The Kansa tribe lived in the Eudora area from the 1600s to the early 1800s. The Kansa lived along the rivers of this region in villages and practiced agriculture. A Kansa village was located at the site of modern day Eudora in the 1790s. In the 1820s the Kansa were forcibly removed from the region by the U.S. government to make room for the Shawnee tribe. The Oregon Trail and Santa Fe Trail passed through the region, just a few miles south of modern Eudora.

In 1854 the Kansas–Nebraska Act was passed, creating the Kansas Territory and opening the region to settlement by Americans. As a result of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, Americans settlers started to encroach upon Indian lands. In 1856, three members of a German Immigrant Settlement Company (called Deutsche-Neusiedlungsverein) from Chicago, sent out a location committee to choose a town site in the new Kansas Territory. Favoring the Eudora area, they drew up contracts with Shawnee Chief Paschal Fish, the original owner of the town site. The new town was named Eudora in honor of Chief Fish&#x27;s daughter. The first post office in Eudora was established in September, 1857. Eudora was incorporated in 1859.

Eudora was the site of conflict during the Bleeding Kansas Era and the American Civil War. Eudora strongly supported the Union during the Civil War, many of its men enlisted to defeat the Confederacy. William Quantrill passed through the Eudora area in 1863 on his way to Lawrence to commit his infamous and deadly raid on the unsuspecting town. Several Eudora residents attempted to warn Lawrence of Quantrill&#x27;s proximity, but two men were thrown from their horses, one of them dying as a result of his injuries. After the raid, Eudorans were quick to aid the citizens of Lawrence as they started their recovery.

After the Civil War, relative stability finally arrived in the region. Eudora grew rapidly in the late 19th century. In the 1860s, a small Jewish community was based in Eudora. In the late 1800s, a sizeable African American community was based in Eudora; as much as 25% of the Eudora community was Black in 1870. Growth in Eudora leveled in the early 20th century. In recent decades, Eudora has again grown tremendously, as a result of its proximity to Lawrence and Kansas City and its location along Kansas Highway 10.

<doc id="114537" wikidata="Q493840" url="?curid=114537" title="Lawrence, Kansas">
<text>Lawrence is a city in and the county seat of Douglas County, Kansas, United States, and the sixth-largest city in the state. It is in the northeastern sector of the state, astride Interstate 70, between the Kansas and Wakarusa Rivers. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 94,934. Lawrence is a college town and the home to both the University of Kansas and Haskell Indian Nations University.

Lawrence was founded by the New England Emigrant Aid Company (NEEAC) and was named for Amos A. Lawrence, an abolitionist from Massachusetts, who offered financial aid and support for the settlement. Lawrence was central to the Bleeding Kansas period (1854–1861), and the site of the Wakarusa War (1855) and the Sacking of Lawrence (1856). During the American Civil War it was also the site of the Lawrence massacre (1863).

Lawrence began as a center of free-state politics. Its economy diversified into many industries, including agriculture, manufacturing, and education, beginning with the founding of the University of Kansas in 1865 and Haskell Indian Nations University in 1884.

==History==
===Settlement and early years===
The Kaw people, also known as the Kansa, settled the region including what is now Lawrence in the late 17th or early 18th century. A series of treaties with the U.S. government compelled the Kaw to relinquish the land to the Shawnee and their Indian Reservation, established in 1830. The Kansas Territory was established in May 1854. During this period, the Oregon Trail ran parallel to the Kansas River, roughly through the area where Lawrence is now. A hill in the area, then known as Hogback Ridge and now known as Mount Oread, which sits on the water divide separating the Kansas and Wakarusa River, was used as a landmark and outlook by those on the trail. While the territory was technically closed to settlement until 1854, there were a few &quot;squatter settlements&quot; in the area, especially just north of the Kansas River.

Lawrence was founded &quot;strictly for political reasons&quot; having to do with slavery, which was heavily debated in the United States in the early to mid-1800s. Northern Democrats, led by Senators Lewis Cass of Michigan and Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, promoted &quot;popular sovereignty&quot; as a middle position on the slavery issue. Its proponents argued it was more democratic, as it allowed the citizens of newly organized territories (and not Washington, D.C. politicians) to have a direct say as to the legality of slavery in their own lands. (Meanwhile, enemies of the bill, especially in the north, derisively called this idea &quot;squatter sovereignty&quot;.) Douglas eventually made popular sovereignty the backbone of his Kansas–Nebraska Actlegislation that effectively repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and created the territories of Kansas and Nebraskawhich passed Congress in 1854.

The Christian abolitionist and Protestant minister Richard Cordley later noted that after the bill became law, &quot;there was a feeling of despondency all over the north&quot; because its passage &quot;opened Kansas to [the possibility of] slavery [which many] thought [was] equivalent to making Kansas a slave state&quot;. This was largely because nearby Missouri allowed slavery, and many rightly assumed the first settlers in Kansas Territory would come from Missouri, bringing their penchant for slavery with them.

In time, anger at the Kansas–Nebraska Act united antislavery forces into a movement committed to stopping the expansion of slavery, eventually institutionalized as the Republican Party. Many slavery opponents decided to &quot;meet the question [of slavery in Kansas] on the terms of the bill itself&quot; by migrating to Kansas, electing antislavery legislators, and eventually banning slavery altogether. These settlers soon became known as &quot;Free-Staters&quot;. Even before the bill passed, some people already had this idea. In early May 1854, four men—Thomas W. and Oliver P. Barber, Samuel Walker, and Thomas M. Pearson—toured the new territory with the intention of finding a good place to settle. Their travels included what would become Lawrence, passing up on the spur of Hogback Ridge. The Kansas-Nebraska Act passed while they were in the territory, and they were instrumental in convincing others to come. In his book &quot;A History of Lawrence&quot; (1895), Cordley wrote:

The most systematic and extensive movement [to populate Kansas], however, was made [by] &quot;The New England Emigrant Aid Company&quot; ... The men engaged in it, Eli Thayer [a Republican in the United States House of Representatives], Amos A. Lawrence [a Republican abolitionist and businessman], and others, began their work at once, arousing public interest and making arrangements to facilitate emigration to Kansas. As early as June, 1854, they sent Dr. Charles Robinson, of Fitchburg, and Mr. Charles H. Branscomb, of Holyoke, to explore the territory and select a site for a colony ... [Previously] Robinson [had journeyed to Kansas, during which] his party climbed the hill along this spur, and looked off over what was afterwards the site of Lawrence. They marked the beauty of the spot and the magnificence of the view. Whether they thought then of what might afterwards occur is not known; but when the time came to select a location for the first colony, Dr. Robinson remembered this view from the hilltop, and this doubtless had much to do in the final decision. When he was asked, therefore, to go and explore the country with a view to locating colonies, it was not altogether an unknown land to him.

Branscomb was tasked with exploring the Kansas River up to about Fort Riley, while Robinson scouted land near Fort Leavenworth and the nearby city of the same name; after assessing the territory they had surveyed, the two recommended the New England Emigrant Aid Company (NEEAC) send its settlers to claim territory along the Oregon Trail near Hogback Ridge. The two likely chose this site because it was the &quot;first desirable location where emigrant Indians had ceded their land rights&quot;. The area was also attractive because it was close to not only on the Oregon Trail, but also the Santa Fe and the 1846 Military Trails.

Concurrent with Robinson and Branscomb&#x27;s exploration, the NEEAC was soliciting some of its members to settle in Kansas. At first, the NEEAC wanted to send a somewhat sizeable group of settlers to claim the land, but a cholera outbreak in the Missouri Valley prevented it. In the end, a group of only 29 menwhich Eli Thayer later called the &quot;pioneer colony&quot;volunteered for the job. Led by Branscomb, these pioneers left Boston, Massachusetts, and set out for Kansas Territory on July 17, 1854; according to Thayer&#x27;s antislavery newspaper the &quot;Kansas Crusader for Freedom&quot;, &quot;Immense crowds had gathered [in Boston] at the station to give them a parting God-speed. They moved out of the station amid the cheering of the crowds who lined the track for several blocks.&quot; In late July, the group met Robinson in St. Louis, and he discussed the next leg of the journey with them and provided them with transportation. The pioneers arrived in Kansas Territory near the end of July, and at about noon on August 1, they ate their first meal on Hogback Ridge itself, which was soon renamed Mount Oread after the Oread Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts. Immediately thereafter, about half this party set off to claim land in the nearby countryside, where about 15 of the original settlers remained, and began to establish a city between Mount Oread and the Kansas River roughly where Massachusetts Street now runs.

While all of this was unfolding, a followup party of 67, guided by Robinson and Samuel C. Pomeroy (an abolitionist and a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives), left Worcester, Massachusetts, on August 31; along the way to Kansas, settlers of similar political inclinations joined this group, and when the party reached its destination on September 911, it had grown to about 114 people. This second party included about ten women, a number of children, and several musicians. A third group of settlers arrived in the vicinity of the future city on October 89, but many &quot;became disgusted by the outlook&quot; of the settlement and returned to New England, feeling they had been &quot;deceived&quot; by the NEEAC. A fourth group of settlers arrived on October 30, followed by a fifth on November 20 and a sixth on December 1. On September 18, the early colonists convened and established a &quot;voluntary municipal government&quot;, and by September 20, the settlers had approved a constitution that included principles of prohibitionatory Maine law to govern their town. The settlement was created against threats by pro-slavery men that the free-staters ought to be &quot;driven from the country&quot;. The first rally of forces from Lawrence was the night of September 30, done to protect Thomas J. Ferril, a free-state Methodist preacher from Missouri. His assailants surrounded his house, threatening violence and to destroy his property, but retreated after they saw a body of armed free-staters without injury to either side. The next day, a woman tore down a free-state man&#x27;s tent. Pro-slavery men rallied to prevent the tent&#x27;s reconstruction by a group of about 20 armed free-staters, but it was completed without violence. The next day, a sizeable band of pro-slavery men appeared, threatening a repeat of the attack, but upon seeing their opponents ready, they retreated with renewed threats of vengeance.

When the settlers arrived, most had called their fledgling city simply Wakarusa, after the nearby river of the same name, but other names were considered, such as New Boston (in recognition of both the NEEAC&#x27;s city of operation and the hometown of many early settlers). Meanwhile, settlers from Missouri derisively called it &quot;Yankee Town&quot;, due to its New England connections. Another name considered around this time was Lawrence. Many approved of this name in honor of Amos A. Lawrence, an Ipswich-based businessman and noted abolitionist, who, Cordley writes, was &quot;a man of wide personal influence&quot; and &quot;one of the first men of means&quot; to fund the Emigrant Aid Company. Others hoped that if they named their town after him, Lawrence would be inclined to support them with monetary donations, which proved correct. Another factor making &quot;Lawrence&quot; a popular choice was that it had &quot;no bad odor attached to it in any part of the Union&quot;. On October 1, the settlement&#x27;s leaders voted to approve &quot;Lawrence&quot; as the name of their new city, and on October 17, the citizens drew territory lots so as to begin erecting homes and businesses. Around this time, the settlers got into a heated argument with pro-slavery squatters, who were hoping to establish a city named Excelsior on the land where Lawrence was being constructed. These pro-slavers threatened violence against anyone who stood in their way, but eventually acquiesced to the New Englanders, and no open conflict occurred.

In early October 1854, the first governor of the Kansas Territory, Andrew Horatio Reeder, arrived, had a reception and a festival, and after a welcoming speech by Pomeroy, made a conciliatory speech urging harmony and order, while evading the slavery question. Lawrence&#x27;s first winter was characterized by great hardship, as the people predominantly lived in sod houses and &quot;shanties made of clap-boards&quot;. About two miles (3.3 km) south of Lawrence, at the first election on November 29, 1854 to elect Congressional delegates, there was a commotion; it ended with a man named Henry Davis attacking a free-stater man named Lucius Kibbee with an Arkansas toothpick knife. The fight ended when Kibbee shot Davis, making this Kansas&#x27;s first homicide.
By the end of 1854, two newspapers touting the free state mission had been established in the town: the &quot;Herald of Freedom&quot;, edited by George W. Brown, and the &quot;Kansas Pioneer&quot;, edited by John Speer, renamed the &quot;Kansas Tribune&quot; after Speer discovered a proslavery &quot;Kansas Pioneer&quot; newspaper existed. A third paper, the &quot;Kansas Free State&quot;, was also created by editors Robert Gaston Elliott and Josiah Miller, and began publication in early January 1855. The Plymouth Congregational Church was started in September 1854 by Reverend S. Y. Lum, a missionary sent to Kansas from Middletown, New York. The first post office in Lawrence was established in January 1855, and E. D. Ladd was appointed the town&#x27;s first postmaster. On January 10, 1855, the first school in Kansas was established in Lawrence by voluntary contributions, and it was taught by Edward P. Fitch.

===&quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot;===
At the start of 1855, settlers who held opposing opinions about slavery settled in the Kansas Territory around the Lawrence area and began to vie for political power. Secret societies, called Blue Lodges, were created, and their sole purpose was to make Kansas a slave state. Their plan was to come into Kansas on the day of the election and vote so as to gain control of the legislature. Before the election, a census determined Kansas had a population of 8,601 with 2,905 of them being voters. Lawrence, specifically, had 369 voters. At the legislature election on March 30, 1855, about 700–1,000 armed pro-slavery men from Missouri voted at the election. They came in over 100 wagons, and they were armed with guns, rifles, pistols, and Bowie knives. They also brought two pieces of artillery. Due to their large numbers, they went unchallenged. They left for Missouri the next morning, having camped in Lawrence the night before. Silas Bond was shot at and driven from the polls on the grounds he was &quot;an obnoxious free-state man&quot;. 1,034 votes were cast in Lawrence, 232 of which were legal, with 802 being from non-residents. There were only 2,905 legal voters in the territory, but 6,307 votes were cast. The people appealed to Governor Andrew Reeder to set the election aside, to which he agreed initially, but after being threatened by pro-slavery people, he decided to hold another election in districts in which there were protests, such as Lawrence. The people of Lawrence felt this did nothing, and many were uncertain about what would happen or what they needed to do.

In June 1855, a meeting was held in Lawrence, at which resolutions were adopted intending to resist any laws that may be passed by the legislature, and they declared that the legislature was elected by &quot;armed usurpers from Missouri&quot;. This paved the way for a larger convention on June 25. Between June 8 and August 15, 1855, seven meetings were held in Lawrence for the purposes of resisting the legislature. The free-state leaders sent George W. Deitzler to the east to secure weapons from other anti-slavery people. Amos Lawrence and others sent crates full of rifles, to which they labeled &quot;books&quot; because &quot;the border ruffians had no use for books, [and] they came through without being disturbed.&quot; With the help of Horace Greeley, a howitzer was sent to Lawrence. On August 27, 1855, the proslavery faction in Douglas County (based primarily out of the territorial capital, Lecompton, as well as smaller satellite settlements like Franklin and Lone Star) got a boost when acting territorial governor Daniel Woodson appointed the zealously proslavery settler Samuel J. Jones to the office of county sheriff. Then, in October 1855, the outspoken abolitionist John Brown arrived in the Kansas Territory; he brought with him a wagon-load of weapons with which he intended to use to fight off &quot;Satan and his legions&quot; (i.e., proslavery settlers).

For much of 1855, the pro- and antislavery factions existed uneasily. Then on November 21, 1855, after an intense verbal altercation, the proslavery settler Franklin N. Coleman shot the Free-Stater Charles Dow in the head, killing him. The murder was the culmination of a long-simmering feud between them, as for some time they had bickered about a land claim near the Hickory Point post office, about south of Lawrence. According to the &quot;Border War Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;Politics had not motivated Coleman to kill Dow, but the murder marked the genesis of the violent political divisions that characterized Kansas for the next 10 years.&quot; When Jones investigated the crime, Coleman argued he had acted in self-defense. The sheriff sided with his proslavery compatriot and chose to instead arrest Dow&#x27;s free state affiliate Jacob Branson for disturbing the peace. Branson was quickly rescued by Samuel Newitt Wood and a gang of Free-Staters by breaking him out of jail. He was rescued at one in the morning, just two hours after the arrest. As the gang of free-staters were heading back, they were unsure of what to do. They consulted with Charles Robinson, and they all realized the pro-slavery people would label this act of breaking someone out of jail as an insurrection. They realized the militia would be called to carry out the arrests of those who broke Branson out of jail, but that they would likely use it as an excuse to destroy Lawrence. The rest of the city was unaware of the rescue at this time. It was decided that the men who broke Branson out of jail would need to keep out of the way. Robinson informed the others at a meeting of citizens that morning, to which they agreed. They then started preparing the city for defense.

===Sacking===

To calm the increasingly belligerent settlers, the governor of the Kansas Territory, Wilson Shannon, called on the Kansas militia to intervene. Shannon had intended for the militia to be composed of Kansans, but Jones mustered a small army of 1,200–1,500 proslavery men, all but about 50 came from Missouri. When the citizens of Lawrence learned of Jones&#x27;s army, they raised up a defensive militia of 600–800 men armed with &quot;Beecher&#x27;s Bibles&quot;. Robinson was chosen to direct the city&#x27;s military operations, the future state senator James Lane was selected as his second-in-command, and a &quot;committee of safety&quot; was also created, which organized squads of about 20 men to keep watch over the city. Lawrence was additionally aided by John Brown and his four sons: John Jr., Oliver, Owen, and Watson. Five forts of earthwork or rifle pits were constructed, and a solid defense was prepared. While both sides were ready for a fight, an outright clash between the two militias was prevented at least in part by the harsh Kansas winter. On December 8, Shannon had had enough and ordered representatives from both sides to meet at the proslavery stronghold of Franklin to sign a peace treaty. Terms were agreed to, and eventually, after much persuading, the Missouri army reluctantly left the area. This conflict, despite its rather diminutive size and scale, would later be known as the &quot;Wakarusa War&quot;.

In the spring of 1856, the proslavery forces, hoping to diminish the power of the anti-slavery settlers, singled out the &quot;Kansas Free State&quot;, the &quot;Herald of Freedom&quot;, and the Free State Hotel (the latter of which the NEEAC owned and operated) as &quot;nuisances&quot; that needed to be stopped. On April 23, 1856 Sheriff Jones entered Lawrence and attempted to arrest about a dozen members of the extralegal Free-State legislature (a rogue governing body set up in opposition to the official proslavery territorial government). During the commotion, Jones was non-fatally shot by a sniper named Charles Lenhart, and Lawrence residents promptly drove the sheriff out of town. The people of Lawrence disavowed the act, and they offered a $500 bounty for the sniper&#x27;s arrest.

A few weeks later, on May 11, Federal Marshal Israel B. Donaldson proclaimed the act had interfered with the legal execution of warrants against select antislavery settlers. This proclamation was bolstered by a Kansas grand jury&#x27;s that &quot;the building known as the &#x27;Free State&#x27; Hotel&#x27; in Lawrence had been constructed with a view to military occupation and defence, regularly parapetted and port holed, for the use of cannon and small arms, thereby endangering the public safety, and encouraging rebellion and sedition in this country&quot;. Donaldson, Jones, and Missouri senator David Rice Atchison consequently raised another army of around 800 Southerners. Ostensibly this army&#x27;s purpose was to enforce the legal arrest warrants, but the group was also motivated by a desire to stamp out the Free-Stater nest that was Lawrence.

On May 21, Donaldson and Jones rode into town and arrested those who had evaded them. While the citizens of Lawrence hoped the officers would leave peacefully, this did not come to pass. Donaldson dismissed his men, who Jomes immediately deputized. The sheriff was then joined by more followers and together they began to sack the city. After seizing the house of Charles Robinson (who had recently been arrested in Missouri, and was held in prison near Lecompton on grounds of treason) to serve as his headquarters, Jones and his men attacked the offices of the antislavery newspapers. The attackers smashed the presses, tossed the type into the nearby Kansas River, and threw printed copies of the newspapers into the wind. Afterward, the proslavery mob shot the Free State Hotel with a cannon and burnt it down. Jones and his men then pillaged $30,000 worth of valuables. When Jones left the city, he and his men lit Robinson&#x27;s house on fire for good measure.

Although the city was thoroughly ransacked, the human cost of the attack was low: only one persona member of Jones&#x27;s possesdied during the attack when he was struck by a piece of falling masonry. In late September 1856, another sack seemed nigh when, according to the Kansas State Board of Agriculture 1878 Biennial Report, &quot;2,700 proslavery men appeared in sight of Lawrence, and the city was temporarily defended by Free-State men, under the command of Maj. J. B. Abbott&quot;. However, this threat was neutralized when the recently-installed territorial governor John W. Geary realized what was about to happen and called for federal reinforcements to defend the city.

===Anti-slavery capital===
In both 1855 and 1857, Lawrence received a charter from the proslavery government in Lecompton, but the citizens, being adamant in their opposition to the &quot;Bogus Legislature&quot;, refused to accept it, as it would have organized Lawrence under proslavery laws. In July 1857, the citizens of Lawrence then attempted to secure an &quot;official&quot; city charter from the Free-State legislature before issuing one themselves. This act was seen as one of bold-faced insurrection by the newly-installed territorial governor Robert J. Walker; as a result, on July 15, 1857 Walker ordered William S. Harney to send a regiment of soldiers to watch over the city and impose martial law. These troops remained in the vicinity of Lawrence until the territorial elections in October of that year. By this time, it seemed as if the struggles of Lawrence&#x27;s early citizens were coming to fruition. In the election of 1857, free-staters gained the upper hand and were able to oust the proslavery majority from the territorial legislature. By the start of the next year, Samuel Joneslong the enemy of Lawrence&#x27;s free state populationresigned his post as sheriff and left the territory. On January 16, 1858, Lawrence was declared the seat of Douglas County (an honor that previously belonged to Lecompton), and in February, the legislature approved the city charter that had been drafted a little less than a year prior in July. James Blood was then elected the first mayor of the city. Around this time, the antislavery legislature often met in Lawrence, which functioned as the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Kansas Territory from 1858 until 1861 (although Lecompton was still the &quot;de jure&quot; seat of the governing body).

===Kansas statehood and the American Civil War===

On October 4, 1859, the Wyandotte Constitution was approved in a referendum by a vote of 10,421 to 5,530, and after its approval by the U.S. Congress, Kansas was admitted as a free state on January 29, 1861. By the time the Wyandotte Constitution was framed in 1859, it was clear the proslavery forces had lost in their bid to control Kansas. But while Kansas&#x27;s entrance into the Union as a free state arguably ended the Bleeding Kansas period, it coincided with the outbreak of the American Civil War. Kansas&#x27;s admission as a free state immediately followed the departure of the seceding states&#x27; pro-slavery congressmen, who until then had blocked it.

During the war, Lawrence became a stronghold for Jayhawker guerilla units (also known as &quot;Red Legs&quot;), led by James Lane, James Montgomery, and &quot;Doc&quot; Jennison, among others. These groups raided parts of western Missouri, stealing goods and burning down farms; it was a common belief by Southerners that the goods snatched by these Jayhawkers were stored in Lawrence. On August 21, 1863, Lawrence was attacked and destroyed by William Quantrill and hundreds of his irregular Confederate raiders. Most houses and businesses in Lawrence were burned and between 150 and 200 men and boys were murdered, leaving 80 widows and 250 orphans. About $2,000,000 worth of property () was destroyed. The Plymouth Congregational Church in Lawrence survived the attack, but a number of its members were killed and its records were destroyed.

Following the Lawrence Massacre, the survivors and their Unionist allies began to clean up the damage and restore their settlement. After a very bitter winter that forced the citizens to temporarily put their work on hold, rebuilding continued into 1864, and was completed with a zeal that Richard Cordley described as akin to &quot;a religious obligation&quot;. Given the trauma of 1863, the citizens of Lawrence were on edge during this period of rebuilding; Cordley notes, &quot;Rumors [of guerrilla attacks] were thick and the people [of Lawrence] were particularly sensitive to them.&quot; Consequently, Lawrence citizens organized themselves into companies to protect the city. Around this time, the federal government also erected several military posts on Mount Oread (among them Camp Ewing, Camp Lookout, and Fort Ulysses) to keep guard over the city. However, no further attacks were made on Lawrence, and these installations were eventually abandoned and dismantled after the war.

===Post-Civil War===

Attempts to begin a university in Kansas were first undertaken in 1855, but it was only after Kansas became a state in 1861 that those attempts saw any real fruition. An institute of learning was proposed in 1859 as The University of Lawrence, but it never opened. When Kansas became a state, provision was included in the Kansas Constitution for a state university. From 1861 to 1863 the question of where the university would be located—Lawrence, Manhattan or Emporia—was debated. On January 13, 1863, Manhattan was made the site of the state&#x27;s land-grant college, leaving only Lawrence and Emporia as candidates. The fact Lawrence had $10,000 plus interest donated by Amos Lawrence plus 40 acres (160,000 m2) to donate for the university had great weight with the legislature. Eventually, Lawrence beat out Emporia by one vote, and in 1866, the University of Kansas (KU) was opened to students.

The first railroad that connected Lawrence was built in 1864, starting from Kansas City. It was surveyed by the Union Pacific Railway, Eastern Division, and the first train to Lawrence traveled on November 28, 1864. The first train to operate in Kansas south of the Kansas River did so by crossing the river in Lawrence on November 1, 1867.
Facing an energy crisis in the early 1870s, the city contracted with Orlando Darling to construct a dam across the Kansas River to help provide the city with power. After an ice jam broke loose and destroyed part of the incomplete dam in the winter of 1873, Darling resigned and left Lawrence shortly thereafter. The Lawrence Land &amp; Water Company completed the dam anyway later that year, but damage to the dam from seasonal floods continued to plague the company, which went into receivership in 1878, after which it was purchased by James H. Gower and his son-in-law, Justin DeWitt Bowersock. Only after Bowersock assumed responsibility for dam repairs in 1879 did regular damage to the dam cease. The Bowersock Dam, which remains the only hydropower dam in the state of Kansas, helped Lawrence establish itself as an industrial city. The dam closed in 1968 but was reopened in 1977 with help from the city, which wanted to build a new city hall next to the Bowersock Plant.

The first wind-powered mill in Kansas was built in Lawrence in 1863 near the corner of what is now 9th Street and Emery Road. It was partially destroyed during Quantrill&#x27;s Raid, but it was rebuilt in 1864 at a cost of $9,700. It continued to be operational until July 1885, but on April 30, 1905, it was destroyed in a fire.

In 1884 the United States Indian Industrial Training School was opened in Lawrence, a Native American Boarding School with the goal of assimilation. Boys were taught the trades of tailor making, blacksmithing, farming and others while girls were taught cooking and homemaking. Most food was produced on site at the Haskell Farm and students were expected to work in addition to their training. In 1885, the school expanded to include academic training and a commercial department with five typewriters opened, starting the first touch-typing class in Kansas. In 1887 the name was changed to the Haskell Institute, after Dudley Haskell, a legislator responsible for the school being in Lawrence. In 1993 the name was changed again to Haskell Indian Nations University.

===20th century and beyond===
In 1888, Watkins National Bank opened at 11th and Massachusetts. Founded by Jabez B. Watkins, the bank would last until 1929. Watkin&#x27;s widow Elizabeth, a philanthropist who also funded buildings for the University of Kansas and two local hospitals, donated the bank building to the city to use as a city hall. In 1970, the city built a new city hall and after extensive renovations, the bank reopened in 1975 as the Elizabeth M. Watkins Community Museum.

In 1903, the Kansas River flooded causing property damage in Lawrence, especially North Lawrence. The water got as high as 27 feet and water marks can still be seen on some buildings especially at TeePee Junction at the U.S. 24–40 intersection and at Burcham Park. Lawrence would be hit by other floods in 1951, where the water rose over 30 feet, and in 1993 but with the reservoir and levee system in place, Lawrence only had minimal damage compared to the other floods.

Also in 1903, Theodore Roosevelt visited Lawrence on his way to Manhattan where he gave a short speech and dedicated a fountain at 9th &amp; New Hampshire. The fountain was later moved to South Park next to the gazebo. Roosevelt would visit Lawrence again in 1910 after visiting Osawatomie where he dedicated the John Brown State Historical Site and gave a speech on New Nationalism.

In 1871, the Lawrence Street Railway Company opened and offered citizens easy access to hotels and businesses along Massachusetts Street. The first streetcar was pulled by horses and mules and the track just ran along Massachusetts Street. After the 1903 flood, the Kansas River bridge had to be rebuilt but was not considered safe for a streetcar to pass over. The Lawrence Street Railway Company closed later that year. In 1907, C.L. Rutter attempted to bring back a bus system, after having failed in 1902. In 1909, a new streetcar system was implemented putting Rutter out of business and lasting until 1935. In 1909, the streetcar company created Casey&#x27;s Coaster (also known as Daisy&#x27;s Dozer), a wooden roller coaster which lasted from 1909 to the 1920s, in Woodland Park.

In 1921, Lawrence Memorial Hospital opened in the 300 block of Maine Street. It started with only 50 beds but by 1980, the hospital would expand to 200.

In 1927, high school classes were offered at Haskell Institute. Haskell&#x27;s Athletics were well-knock; they were known as the &quot;Powerhouse of the West&quot; with victories over Oklahoma A&amp;M, Kansas State, Texas, and Nebraska. The Olympian Jim Thorpe graduated from the program. The last high school class graduated in 1965, the school was transitioning to post-high school education. In 1970, the school became known as Haskell Indian Junior College, and in 1993, &quot;Haskell Indian Nations University&quot;.

In 1929 Lawrence began celebrating its 75th anniversary. The city dedicated Founder&#x27;s Rock, commonly referred to as the Shunganunga Boulder, a huge red boulder brought to Lawrence from near Tecumseh. The rock honors the two parties of the Emigrant Aid Society who first settled in Lawrence. Lawrence also dedicated the Lawrence Municipal Airport on October 14.


In 1943, the federal government transported German and Italian prisoners of World War II to Kansas and other Midwest states to work on farms and help solve the labor shortage caused by American men serving in the war effort. Large internment camps were established in Kansas: Camp Concordia, Camp Funston (at Fort Riley), Camp Phillips (at Salina under Fort Riley). Fort Riley established 12 smaller branch camps, including Lawrence. The camp in Lawrence was near 11th &amp; Haskell Avenue near the railroad tracks. The camp would close by the end of 1945.

In 1947, Gilbert Francis and his son George opened Francis Sporting Goods downtown, selling mostly fishing and hunting gear. In November 2014, Francis Sporting Goods, announced its retail business within what had become Lawrence&#x27;s Downtown Historic District would close by the end of the year, allowing the Francis family to focus on supplying uniforms and equipment to teams.

In the early 1980s, Lawrence grabbed attention from the television movie &quot;The Day After&quot;. The TV movie first appeared on ABC but was later shown in movie theaters around the world. The movie depicted what would happen if the United States were destroyed in a nuclear war. The movie was filmed in Lawrence, and hundreds of local residents appeared in the film as extras and in speaking roles.

In 2020, a report commissioned by the Lawrence City Council concluded the city needed to promote a vital expansion or risk turning into an unaffordable albatross, saying &quot;If Lawrence doesn&#x27;t attract more kinds of businesses, it could become a bedroom community that’s not affordable for people who don&#x27;t commute elsewhere.&quot;

==Geography==
Lawrence is located approximately east of Topeka, and west of Kansas City, Kansas. Though Lawrence has a designated elevation of 866 feet (264 m), the highest elevation is Mount Oread on the University of Kansas campus with an elevation of 1,020 feet (310 m).

The city lies on the southern edge of the Dissected Till Plains, bordering the Osage Plains to the south. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water, and is split between Wakarusa Township and Grant Township with small portions in Lecompton, Kanwaka and Clinton Townships.

Lawrence is between the Kansas and Wakarusa Rivers. Several major creeks flow through Lawrence. Burroughs Creek in East Lawrence (named after the writer William S. Burroughs, who retired in East Lawrence) and Baldwin Creek in northwestern Lawrence empty into the Kansas River. Yankee Tank Creek in southwest Lawrence and an unnamed creek that flows through central Lawrence converge with the Wakarusa River south of the city. Yankee Tank Creek is dammed to form Lake Alvamar, which was originally called Yankee Tank Lake. The Wakarusa River was dammed to form Clinton Lake. Potter Lake is on the University of Kansas Campus and Mary&#x27;s Lake is in southeastern Lawrence within Prairie Park. The Haskell-Baker Wetlands, maintained by Haskell University and Baker University, is an extensive open space in the southern part of the city that features wetlands, native plants, hiking and biking trails, and interpretative signage about the prairie and wetland ecosystems.

Lawrence has 54 parks which include community and neighborhood parks, trails, cemeteries and nature preserves. A new, multi-use trail system called the Lawrence Loop (&quot;the Loop&quot;) encircles the city and, when fully completed, will create a 22-mile paved recreational trail, a green transportation network, and multiple opportunities for environmental restoration. Community parks include South Park, Buford Watson Park, Broken Arrow Park, Riverfront Park, Holcomb Park, &quot;Dad&quot; Perry Park, Centennial Park and Prairie Park. Cemeteries include Oak Hill, Maple Grove and Memorial Park. The first cemetery in Lawrence, Pioneer Cemetery, is on the University of Kansas campus and is maintained by KU.

===Climate===
Lawrence has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;), typically experiencing hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters. The hottest temperature recorded in Lawrence was on August 10, 1934 and August 14, 1936, while the coldest temperature recorded was on February 12, 1899.

==Cityscape==

===Streets===
The early settlers of the town named the city&#x27;s main road &quot;Massachusetts&quot; to commemorate the New England Emigrant Aid Company&#x27;s home state. As laid out on the first map of Lawrence, the north–south streets to the east of Massachusetts Street were named for the original thirteen colonies running from the geographic south to the north, with only Massachusetts and New Hampshire streets out of order (guaranteeing Massachusetts Street the honor of the central business corridor), while those streets west of Massachusetts Street were named for states in order of admittance to the Union. East–west streets were named after &quot;men who had done something in the sacred cause of liberty&quot;. Over the years, however, this plan became marred. A number of streets were placed in the wrong order, North and South Carolina were consolidated into a single Carolina Street near Lawrence High School, and the names of nine states (Alaska, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wyoming) were never given to streets. The state street naming system was abandoned after the establishment of Iowa Street, which runs through the center of Lawrence. In 1913, the east–west streets were renamed to numbered streets.

===Neighborhoods===
Lawrence is designated by neighborhoods. Neighborhoods closest to downtown are Old West Lawrence, North Lawrence, East Lawrence, Oread, Hancock and Pinkney. The neighborhoods west of Iowa Street are Sunset Hills, Prairie Meadows, Deerfield, and Alvamar. There are several neighborhoods listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Old West Lawrence, Oread, Hancock, Breezedale, and most of Rhode Island Street in East Lawrence.

====North Lawrence====
Grant Township, north of the Kansas River, was annexed to Douglas County in 1870 from southern Sarcoxie Township in Jefferson County. The largest city in the township was Jefferson, founded in 1866 just over the river from Lawrence. Jefferson was renamed North Lawrence in 1869 and it was attempted to annex the town to Lawrence proper but the motion failed. The following year, the State Legislature annexed the town.

Just northeast of North Lawrence there once was a popular park area known as Bismarck Grove. During the late 19th century, this area housed numerous fairs, picnics, and temperance meetings. In 1870, the Kansas Pacific railroad set up a number of manufacturing and repair shops in this area, which became known as &quot;Bismarck&quot;. The first organized gathering in the area took place in 1878 was the National Temperance camp meeting. The last fair was held at the Grove in 1899, and due to financial issues, the area was sold and became private property in 1900.

===Architecture===
The architecture of Lawrence is greatly varied. Most buildings built before 1860 were destroyed in the Lawrence Massacre. Architectural styles represented in Lawrence&#x27;s historical areas are Victorian, Gothic Revival, Tudor, Romanesque and many others.

==Demographics==
Lawrence is part of the Kansas City (MO)–Overland Park–Kansas City (KS) Combined Statistical Area.

The city&#x27;s planning and urban development department estimates the city reached 100,000 people in early 2018.

===2020 census===
The 2020 United States census counted 94,934 people, 39,688 households, and 19,602 families in Lawrence. The population density was 2,779.7 per square mile (1,073.3/km). There were 43,421 housing units at an average density of 1,271.4 per square mile (490.9/km).

==Economy==
Lawrence&#x27;s economy largely depends on educational institutions, namely The University of Kansas, which is the largest employer in the city as of 2020 with 10,116 employees, followed by Maximus (a call center), Lawrence Memorial Hospital (the city&#x27;s hospital) and Hallmark Cards.

=== Homelessness ===
As of 2020, Lawrence&#x27;s unemployment rate had grown by 3.7%. Since 2019, the city has seen a rise in homelessness. In 2021, NPR reported that Lawrence and nearby Kansas City, Kansas had a large rise in homelessness. In Lawrence, the situation necessitated that the city construct an encampment for people to seek temporary shelter. In early 2021, reportedly 200 homeless people lived on the banks of the Kansas River, and wooded areas near nature trails in Lawrence, and hundreds of others setting up encampments in city parks. In February 2023, the Lawrence City Commission approved an ordinance banning source of income discrimination, disallowing landlords from rejecting housing vouchers. The ordinance also banned discrimination in housing due to immigration status and being a survivor of sexual assault.

==Historic sites and museums==
South Park is a large park in Downtown Lawrence divided by Massachusetts Street just south of the county courthouse between North Park and South Park Streets. The park originally consisted of four separate parks—Lafayette, Hamilton, Washington and Franklin Parks—but was combined to form one park. South Park was developed in 1854 as part of the original city plat. A gazebo was built in South Park in 1910 and is used for annual city band performances during the summer months.

The Watkins Museum of History is a block north of South Park and houses exhibits from Lawrence and Douglas County. The building is managed by the Douglas County Historical Society and used to be Watkins National Bank (1888–1929) and Lawrence City Hall (1929–1970). The building features a range of architectural styles from the period it was constructed. Today it houses the Watkins Museum of History, which offers free admission and three floors of traditional and computer interactive exhibits. Next door to the museum is a Japanese Friendship Garden designed by the city and representatives from sister city Hiratsuka, Japan. An exhibit on the Bleeding Kansas era and the Freedom&#x27;s Frontier National Heritage Area is in the old Lawrence Public Library at 9th and Vermont Streets. Other museums on KU campus include the Natural History Museum in Dyche Hall, the Spencer Museum of Art and the Dole Institute of Politics among others.

Centennial Park, between 6th and 9th Streets and Rockledge Road and Iowa Street, was established in 1954 for the city&#x27;s 100th anniversary. The park features rolling hills, a skatepark, a disc golf course and a Polaris missile constructed during the Cold War. Sesquicentennial Park is near Clinton Lake and was established for Lawrence&#x27;s 150th anniversary and is mostly undeveloped but features a timeline of Lawrence history and a time capsule to be opened in 2054.

Liberty Hall was built when the Bowersock Opera House burned down in 1911. Liberty Hall is a theater typically showcasing independent movies and frequent live acts. Liberty Hall also runs a video rental next door. The Granada Theater was originally built in 1928 as a vaudeville theater. It was renovated in 1934 as a movie theater until closing in 1989. It was renovated again in 1993 and opened as a venue for comedy acts and live music.
The Eldridge Hotel was first built in 1855 as the Free State Hotel. During the 1855 sack of Lawrence, the hotel was burned to the ground, and its ruins were purchased by Col. Shalor Eldridge, who rebuilt it and named it the Eldridge House. This version of the structure was destroyed during Quantrill&#x27;s Raid, but once again Eldridge rebuilt it. In 1925, this structure was completely renovated, and in 1970, the hotel was converted into apartments. In 1985, work began to renovate the Eldridge and turn it back into a hotel, and in 2004 the building was sold and completely renovated back to its 1925 look. It is a popular rumor that the ghost of Eldridge haunts the hotel.

Memorial Stadium and Allen Fieldhouse are on KU campus. Memorial Stadium was built in 1920 for the Kansas Jayhawks football program. It was named to honor KU students who died in World War I. Allen Fieldhouse was built in 1955 for the basketball program and was named for Phog Allen, a coach at KU from 1907 to 1909 and 1919 to 1956. On November 4, 2010, the ESPN&#x27;s online publication, &quot;The Magazine&quot;, named Allen Fieldhouse the loudest college basketball arena in the country.

Oak Hill Cemetery in east Lawrence was established in 1866 and was called by William Allen White the &quot;Kansas Arlington&quot;. The cemetery features the burials of James Lane, Lucy Hobbs Taylor, Langston Hughes&#x27; grandparents Charles Henry Langston and Mary Sampson Patterson Leary Langston, numerous veterans and many prominent Kansans. Across the street is Memorial Park Cemetery which features a memorial for KU coach and inventor of basketball James Naismith. The memorial is a cenotaph but Naismith is buried in the mason section of Memorial Park.

Lawrence is also the site of many historic houses related to the history of the city. The Robert Miller house survived Quantrill&#x27;s Raid and was a stop on the Underground Railroad, Ferdinand Fuller, an original settler of Lawrence, built his house atop of Windmill Hill in what is now the Hillcrest Neighborhood and the John Roberts House, commonly called the Castle Tea Room, was designed by famed architect John G. Haskell in 1894 and is now used for various formal events. There are many other houses of historic prominence in Lawrence, many of them on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Arts and culture==
The city is known for a thriving music and art scene. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said Lawrence had &quot;the most vital music scene between Chicago and Denver&quot; in a travel column on February 25, 2005.

The Lied Center of Kansas presents Broadway musicals, internationally touring dance companies and headline artists such as The Beach Boys, Kristin Chenoweth, Lyle Lovett and Kansas.

In December 2005, the city announced International Dadaism Month, celebrating the early 20th century art movement. In the spirit of Dada, rather than select a typical calendar month for the occasion, Mayor Dennis &quot;Boog&quot; Highberger set the dates for the &quot;Month&quot; as February 4, March 28, April 1, July 15, August 2, August 7, August 16, August 26, September 18, September 22, October 1, October 17, and October 26, determined by rolling dice and pulling numbers out of a hat.

Lawrence is home to many bands and record labels. Many artists, such as Paw, Mates of State, The New Amsterdams, Kansas, Fourth of July, White Flight, The Anniversary, Minus Story, The Appleseed Cast, Old Canes, Ad Astra Per Aspera, Ghosty, The Esoteric and The Get Up Kids originated in Lawrence or its surrounding areas. KJHK 90.7 FM, the University of Kansas&#x27;s student-run radio station, is a staple of the local music scene.

The Wakarusa Music and Camping Festival was a four-day-long weekend music festival held annually in early June just outside Lawrence, at Clinton State Park. After its inception in 2004, the festival grew dramatically by 2006, with almost 60,000 tickets sold, and developed a nationwide following that accounted for 80% of ticket sales. The festival featured an eclectic mix of music, with artists like The Flaming Lips, Wilco, STS9, Medeski, Martin and Wood, Neko Case, and Widespread Panic taking the stage. The event is kept smaller than other festivals such as Bonnaroo by an agreement with the state. Activities other than music include disc golf, yoga, hiking, and swimming in Clinton Lake. The festival was relocated to Mulberry Mountain due to a dispute between the organizers and the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks over limiting attendees and over rent payment.

Lawrence is home to the Gunn Center for the Study of Science Fiction, the first research center in the world dedicated to science fiction studies. Since 1969, the center has offered courses and workshops in science fiction literature and writing, hosted an annual conference, brought speakers to Lawrence, and presented multiple annual awards and scholarships.

Every summer since 1959 there is the Massachusetts Street &quot;sidewalk sale&quot;, which most businesses on Massachusetts Street offer discounts on their merchandise. The sale is often supplemented by band performances or radio stations playing during the event.

==Sports==

Lawrence is also the home of the University of Kansas (KU) athletic teams. The perennially highly ranked Kansas Jayhawks basketball team (1922 and 1923 Helms Foundation National Champions and 1952, 1988, 2008, and 2022 NCAA Champions) is closely followed by most residents during the winter. Massachusetts Street, the primary street of downtown Lawrence, flooded with fans in 2002, 2003, 2008, 2012, and 2022, after both KU&#x27;s victories and defeats in the final rounds of the NCAA tournaments those years. KU&#x27;s football team had their best record in their school history in the 2007–2008 season going 12–1 and culminating with a victory in the Orange Bowl. In 2008, the football and basketball programs achieved a 49-4 record, the most combined wins by the two NCAA sports in a single season.

Lawrence honored the University of Kansas&#x27;s mascot, the Jayhawk, in 2003 when 30 statues of Jayhawks were commissioned by the Lawrence Convention and Visitors Bureau; these can be seen throughout the city as part of an art installation called &quot;Jayhawks on Parade&quot;. The Jayhawks also field a soccer team, baseball and softball teams, track and field teams, cross country teams, and a men&#x27;s club hockey team. KU also has a club rugby team, run by the KU Rugby Football club, with a clubhouse in North Johnny&#x27;s Tavern. They also run the high school and the club team.

In 1893, Lawrence briefly hosted a minor league baseball team, the Lawrence Jayhawks. The team played as members of the Class A level Western Association and hosted home minor league games at the South Massachusetts Street Ballpark.

==Government==


Lawrence is run by a city commission and city manager. Commissioners consists of five individuals elected by the citizens. Three commissioner seats are up for reelection every two years. The two top vote-getters receive a four-year term, third-place finisher receives a two-year term. The commission elects a mayor and vice-mayor every year in April, usually the two top vote-getters, and also hires the city manager. Lawrence uses plurality-at-large voting (also known as block voting) for its municipal elections, whereby voters may choose up to three candidates for office.

While Kansas is a heavily Republican state, Lawrence is often considered a bastion of the modern Democratic Party, and has been since the late 1980s. Douglas County, where Lawrence is situated, was one of only two counties in Kansas whose majority voted for John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election, one of only three that voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 election and one of the only two counties to vote for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Douglas County has supported the Democratic candidate for the past nine presidential elections.

Lawrence is served by Democratic state representatives Christina Haswood, Mike Amyx, Barbara Ballard and Dennis Highberger, and by state senators Marci Francisco (Democrat), Tom Holland (Democrat), and Rick Kloos (Republican). Lawrence is represented federally by Republican Tracey Mann of the 1st and U.S. Senators Roger Marshall and Jerry Moran, both Republicans. Prior to 2002, Lawrence sat entirely within the 3rd district until reapportionment split Lawrence between the 2nd and 3rd districts. In 2012, Lawrence was placed entirely within the 2nd district. In 2022, the Kansas State Legislature moved Lawrence into the 1st district after legal challenges failed in the Kansas Supreme Court.

Lawrence was the first city in Kansas to enact an ordinance prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation (enacted in 1995, after a campaign called Simply Equal). On October 4, 2011, Lawrence became the first city in Kansas to prohibit discrimination based on gender identity with the passage of City Ordinance No. 8672. The effort to pass the GIO was led by Scott Criqui from the Kansas Equality Coalition. Scott Criqui would go on to become the first openly gay candidate to run for office and win a primary in Lawrence. Douglas County was the only county in Kansas to reject the amendment to the Kansas Constitution prohibiting both gay marriage and civil unions in April 2005. The vote against the amendment was primarily in the city of Lawrence; outside the city in the rest of Douglas County, the amendment carried. Lawrence has an active chapter of the Kansas Equality Coalition, which persuaded the city commission to approve a domestic partner registry on May 22, 2007. The registry, which took effect on August 1, 2007, provides unmarried couples —both same-sex and other-sex— some recognition by the city for legal purposes.

===Libraries===

The first library in Lawrence was started in October 1854 and was a subscription library costing $1 a year. After the Lawrence Massacre destroyed the library, a new one was started in 1865 and placed under city jurisdiction in 1871. In 1902, Peter Emery successfully got a grant from Andrew Carnegie to build a new library at 9th and Vermont Streets. The Lawrence Public Library opened in 1904. A new library to replace the aging and outdated Carnegie Building was completed in 1972 at 7th and Vermont Streets with voters approving a bond issue in 2010 to expand and update the building. During construction, the library moved to 7th and New Hampshire in the former Borders bookstore. The new library opened in July 2014.

The Lawrence Public Library was one of seven libraries in the United States that won the AIA/ALA Library Building Award in 2016.

==Media==

In August 1885, the Lawrence &quot;Daily Journal&quot; began and the Lawrence &quot;Daily World&quot; began in June 1895. These papers would merge in 1911 to become the &quot;Lawrence Journal-World&quot; although the masthead lists the founding as 1858, probably in reference to the &quot;Herald of Freedom&quot;. Other newspapers include The &quot;University Daily Kansan&quot;, a student newspaper from the University of Kansas, The &quot;Open Kansan&quot;, an independent student newspaper from the University of Kansas, &quot;The Lawrence Times&quot;, an online newspaper founded by former &quot;Lawrence Journal-World&quot; employees, and &quot;Change of Heart&quot;, a street newspaper sold by homeless vendors.

Lawrence is in the Kansas City television market, but viewers can also receive stations from the Topeka market as well. Television stations licensed and/or broadcasting from Lawrence are KUJH-LP, a KU student station, and KMCI which broadcasts from Kansas City, Missouri.

From 1947 until 1981, Lawrence was the location of the Centron Corporation, one of the major industrial and educational film production companies in the United States at the time. The studio was founded by two University of Kansas graduates and employed university students and faculty members as advisers and actors. Also, many talented local and area filmmakers were given their first chances to make movies with Centron, and some stayed for decades. Others went on to successful careers in Hollywood. One of these local residents, Herk Harvey, was employed by Centron as a director for 35 years and in the middle of his tenure there he made a full-length theatrical film, &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot;, a horror cult film shot mostly in Lawrence and released in 1962.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===


Interstate 70, as the Kansas Turnpike, runs east–west along the northern edge of the city, interchanging with U.S. Route 59 which runs north–south along North 2nd Street, 6th Street and Iowa Street. Another east–west route, U.S. Route 40, runs through northern Lawrence along 6th Street roughly 2 miles south of I-70. U.S. 40 runs concurrently east–west with U.S. 59 for approximately 1 mile between Iowa Street and Massachusetts Street. The two routes turn north before crossing I-70. One half-mile north of I-70, U.S. 40 splits from U.S. 59 and turns east, running concurrently with U.S. 24, exiting the city.

K-10, an east–west state highway, enters the city from the east along 23rd Street, then turns south, running concurrently with U.S. 59 for 1.5 miles before splitting off and continuing west and finally north around western Lawrence as a bypass, terminating at an interchange with I-70 northwest of the city. The K-10 South Lawrence Trafficway is a project with the goal to connect K-10 and the Kansas Turnpike. To transfer between K-10 and the Kansas Turnpike, drivers must use Lawrence city streets. The K-10 South Lawrence Trafficway, already partially built, was proposed as a solution to traffic, air quality, and safety concerns. However, the project has received criticism and been the subject of many protests for more than a decade because of opposition to the trafficway being built through the Haskell-Baker Wetlands. More recently, it appears completion of the project is underway. In June 2011, the Kansas Department of Transportation announced it would provide $192 million to complete the trafficway and in July 2012, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court&#x27;s ruling that all necessary permits were properly obtained and construction could commence. As for the wetlands, about 56 acres were taken for the construction of the South Lawrence Trafficway; because of this some 380 acres of human-made wetlands were developed next to the site.

Two bus systems operate in the city. Lawrence Transit, known locally as &quot;The T&quot;, is a public bus system operated by the city, and KU on Wheels is operated by the University of Kansas.

The UP line does the same on the north side of the river, running through the city&#x27;s northeast corner. Using the BNSF trackage, Amtrak provides passenger rail service on its &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; line between Chicago and Los Angeles. Amtrak&#x27;s Lawrence station is a few blocks east of downtown.

Eric Kripke, the creator of &quot;Supernatural&quot;, decided to have the two brothers be from Lawrence because of its closeness to Stull Cemetery, a location famous for its urban legends. 

Lawrence was destroyed in the 2006 TV Series &quot;Jericho&quot;.

American folk singer Josh Ritter&#x27;s song &quot;Lawrence KS&quot; is on the 2002 album &quot;Golden Age of Radio.&quot; Cross Canadian Ragweed&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Mission California&quot; features the song &quot;Lawrence&quot;, which was inspired by a homeless family the band encountered near Christmas while visiting the town.

Lawrence&#x27;s Meadowbrook Apartments residential complex is the default starting point for the map program Google Earth. This location was set by Brian McClendon, a 1986 graduate of the University of Kansas and director of engineering for Google Earth, who lived in the complex as a child.

<text>Lecompton (pronounced ) is a city in Douglas County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 588. Lecompton, located on the Kansas River, was the &quot;de jure&quot; territorial capital of Kansas from 1855 to 1861, and the Douglas County seat from 1855 to 1858. Anti-slavery Lawrence became the &quot;de facto&quot; capital during the latter part of this period, when the county seat was moved there. This time period was known as Bleeding Kansas, due to the violence perpetrated by the pro-slavery, and to a lesser extent the anti-slavery, factions in the eastern part of the state. Lecompton was a hotbed of pro-slavery sentiment during the mid-1800s.

==History==
===19th century===
Lecompton was founded in 1854, on a bluff on the south bank of the Kansas River. It was originally called Bald Eagle, and was renamed Lecompton in honor of Samuel Dexter Lecompte, the chief justice of the territorial Supreme Court. In August 1855, the city became the capital of the Kansas Territory after President Franklin Pierce appointed Andrew Horatio Reeder as governor and charged him and his officials with establishing government offices in Lecompton. The city soon became a stronghold of pro-slavery politics and Southern sympathy, which put it in conflict with nearby Lawrence, which had been founded by Free-Staters from Massachusetts.

The first post office in Lecompton was established in September 1855. The city served as the seat of Douglas County, until 1858, when it was moved to Lawrence.

In late 1857, a convention met in Constitution Hall and drafted the Lecompton Constitution, under which Kansas would have been a slave state. The constitution was rejected by Congress after intense national debate and was one of the prime topics of the Lincoln-Douglas debates. The controversy contributed to the growing dispute soon to erupt in civil war. The Lecompton Constitution failed, in part, because the antislavery party won control of the territorial legislature in the election of 1857. The new legislature met at Constitution Hall and immediately began to abolish the pro-slavery laws of what they called the Bogus Legislature, the territory&#x27;s pro-slavery lawmakers since July 1855.

The free-staters briefly attempted to move the territorial capital to Minneola through a vote, although the resulting bill was later vetoed by Kansas territorial governor James W. Denver, and ruled void by U.S. Attorney General Jeremiah S. Black. As such, Lecompton remained the &quot;de jure&quot; territorial capital until the victorious free-state leaders officially chose Topeka as capital when Kansas became a state on January 29, 1861. The American Civil War began on April 12, 1861.

In 1865, the United Brethren Church established a university in Lecompton. Occupying the Rowena hotel that was originally built for the Territorial Legislature and visitors, the university later built a stone building in 1882 on the foundation of the started, but not completed, capitol building. Named &quot;Lane University&quot; after the free-stater James H. Lane, the university brought professors and students to community. It thrived until 1902, when Lane University moved to Holton, Kansas and merged to form Campbell College, which in turn merged with the now-defunct Kansas City University. The bell from Lane University went with the move, and today can be found on the campus of Holton High School. The Lane University building was then used for the high school in Lecompton until a larger brick building was built just to the south of it in 1926. The Lane University building fell into disrepair. In the 1970s, the community raised funds to rehabilitate the old building to become the Territorial Capital Museum, maintained by the Lecompton Historical Society. Two blocks away is Constitution Hall, where the infamous Lecompton Constitution was written in 1857. Constitution Hall is a museum operated by the Kansas Historical Society.

In the 1880s, there was some dissension in the United Brethren Church concerning secret organizations, causing the congregation to split. One group built another church on adjoining land which they named the Radical United Brethren Church. It burned about 1902 and a limestone church building replaced it. The former church was used as the Lecompton City Hall until about 2006, when a newer city hall was built in the old Lecompton Fire Station. The limestone church building is now a community building and a Douglas County sheriff&#x27;s substation. In 2016, the Radical United Brethren Church was placed on the Kansas Register for Historic Places. With the building&#x27;s addition to the historic register, Lecompton now has four buildings on either Kansas or national registers. The other three are Constitutional Hall, where two state constitutions were drafted in the 1850s in hopes of bringing Kansas into the union as a slave state; the Democratic Headquarters from the Bleeding Kansas era; and the Lane University building, which is now the Territorial Capital Museum.

When the frame business buildings on the east side of main street (Elmore) were destroyed by fire in 1916, they were replaced with brick structures. A mural depicting the city as it appeared before the fire is located in the local post office building.

===20th century===
In 1998, the Lecompton Historical Society began restoring the remains of the native limestone Democratic Headquarters Building . Originally there was a log cabin connected to the west side of this building located on East Second Street. The historic building was moved to Riverview Park, a public park along the south limestone bluff of the Kansas River, overlooking the Kaw Valley basin to the north.

===21st century===

, downtown Lecompton had an antique shop, cafe/diner, art shop, and an automobile restoration garage. A convenience store/meat market was located on the edge of the city. The City of Lecompton bought the old Lecompton High School from the local school district and began remodeling it into a community building.

Moline is known for being the home of Kansas&#x27; oldest swinging (suspension-type) bridge, built in 1904. The bridge spans over a lower portion of a local stream, Wildcat Creek. Immediately to the west of the famous Swinging Bridge, a limestone water fall formation flows with water through much of the rainy season in late winter and early spring.

==History==
Moline is located on a slightly elevated plateau in the valley of Wildcat Creek, named so by the indigenous Native Americans because of the prominent number of wildcats (Bobcats) that lived along the stream. In early 1879 as the Santa Fe Railway extended westward from Independence, Missouri, towns sprung up vigorously along the line. The Land and Town Company chartered the land for the city on July 21, 1879 and laid out the town. The name Moline was decided upon at the suggestion of Mr. J.F. Chapman, of the original town company, who came from the area of Moline, Illinois, and because the farmers in the area largely used the Moline plow.

The first post office in Moline was established in September, 1879.

<text>Hays is a city in and the county seat of Ellis County, Kansas, United States. The largest city in northwestern Kansas, it is the economic and cultural center of the region. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 21,116. It is home to Fort Hays State University.

== History ==
Before American settlement of the area, the site of Hays was located near where the territories of the Arapaho, Kiowa, and Pawnee met. Claimed first by France as part of Louisiana and later acquired by the United States with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, it lay within the area organized by the U.S. as Kansas Territory in 1854. Kansas became a state in 1861. The state government delineated the surrounding area as Ellis County in 1867.

In 1865, the U.S. Army established Fort Fletcher southeast of present-day Hays to protect stagecoaches traveling the Smoky Hill Trail. A year later, the Army renamed the post Fort Hays in honor of the late Brig. Gen. Alexander Hays, killed in The Battle of The Wilderness. In late 1866, anticipating the construction of the Kansas Pacific Railway as far west as Fort Hays, a party from St. Louis, Missouri led by William Webb selected three sections of land for colonization near the fort. In June 1867, to better serve the railroad, the Army relocated Fort Hays 15 miles northwest to a site near where the railroad was to cross Big Creek, a tributary of the Smoky Hill River. Seeing a business opportunity, Buffalo Bill Cody and railroad contractor William Rose founded the settlement of Rome near the fort&#x27;s new location. Within a month, the population of Rome grew to over 2,000. Webb, meanwhile, established the Big Creek Land Company and then surveyed and platted a town site, which he named Hays City after the fort, roughly one mile east of Rome. The railroad reached Hays City soon thereafter and constructed a depot there. The railroad&#x27;s arrival, combined with a cholera epidemic that hit Rome in the late summer of 1867, drove Rome businesses and residents to relocate to Hays City. Within a year, Rome was completely abandoned. As the western terminus of the railway, Hays City grew rapidly, serving as the supply point for territories to the west and southwest.

As a frontier town, Hays City experienced the kind of violence that gave rise to the myth of the American Old West. Several notable figures of the Old West lived in the Hays City of this era, including George Armstrong Custer, his wife Elizabeth Bacon Custer, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill Cody, and Wild Bill Hickok who served a brief term as sheriff in 1869. 30 homicides occurred between 1867 and 1873 including a deadly saloon shootout involving Fort Hays soldiers. A cemetery north of town became known as “Boot Hill”; by 1885, it held the bodies of some 79 outlaws.

Hays experienced significant racial violence during the same period. On January 7, 1869, the murder of Union Pacific watchman James Hayes led to the lynching of three African American soldiers of the 38th US Infantry Regiment. That same year, six black soldiers at Fort Hays were murdered, their bodies were dropped in a well that was sodded over, and they were falsely reported as deserters. A mob then hunted down and lynched two black barbers, and the town&#x27;s black residents were expelled. This and numerous other racial incidents throughout the last half of the 19th century gave Hays a reputation as a sundown town. African Americans living in nearby Nicodemus were not welcome after dark. No signs formally establishing this policy were posted, but the town&#x27;s reputation for racial discrimination persisted for decades. Hays City became the county seat of Ellis County in 1870, and the town became more civilized. Rougher elements of the populace had begun to leave in the late 1860s, many following the Kansas Pacific railroad construction west to Sheridan or moving south to Dodge City. Volga Germans started settling in Ellis County in 1876, finding its land suitable for their lifestyle and the types of crops they had grown in Russia. They brought with them Turkey Red Wheat, a type of winter wheat whose cultivation contributed to the agricultural transformation of the region. Bukovina Germans began settling in the area in 1886. These groups had a significant impact on the local way of life, establishing Hays as a regional center of ethnic German culture. Hays City was incorporated in 1885, and in 1895, it was renamed as simply Hays.

Fort Hays closed in 1889. In 1900, the Kansas delegation to the U.S. Congress secured the fort&#x27;s land and facilities for educational purposes. The following year, the Kansas Legislature established the Fort Hays Experiment Station, part of Kansas State Agricultural College, on the Fort Hays reservation and set aside land for the Western Branch of Kansas State Normal School, which opened in 1902 and eventually became Fort Hays State University. Fort Hays opened as a historical park in 1929 and was later acquired by the Kansas Historical Society. In 1967, it became the Fort Hays State Historic Site.

Several disasters have struck Hays over the course of its history. In 1895, fire destroyed 60 buildings downtown. Severe floods occurred in 1907 and 1951. In 1919, three Standard Oil gasoline tanks exploded, killing eight and injuring approximately 150 people. In 1935, the city experienced violent dust storms as part of the Dust Bowl.

Hays began to modernize in the early 1900s with a power plant, waterworks, telephone exchange, and sewer system complete by 1911. Over the following decades, the city evolved into a regional economic hub. Development of oil fields in the surrounding area began in 1936 with Hays serving as a trading center and shipping point. Hays Regional Airport opened in 1961. Interstate 70 reached Hays in 1966. Today, Hays is a commercial and educational center for western Kansas.

<text>Victoria is a city in Herzog Township, Ellis County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 1,129.

==History==
The town site originated in the 1867 construction of the Kansas Pacific Railway into western Kansas to connect St. Louis to Denver and to open the land to settlement. The railroad&#x27;s sudden rerouting and construction west of Junction City was opposed by a Cheyenne military society who attacked the Campbell camp who were establishing a bridge grade across the North Fork of Big Creek at this location (pictured). Commanded by Captain George Armes, the immediate U.S. military response resulted in the Battle of the Saline River, which was followed by two years of open conflict.

=== Victoria Colony ===
George Grant was a Scottish entrepreneur who had established wealth and a clientele that counted the British nobility. In 1873, George Grant arrived in Kansas leading a party of 30 young adults and youth of Scottish and English nobility, including some remittance men sent away by their families to live on stipends. Founding the first of several organized transatlantic settlements in Ellis County, Grant intended to create a ranching community, some lesser nobles of the party hoping to establish large estates in the frontier. Notably, this group brought a herd of thoroughbred Aberdeen Angus cattle, some from Queen Victoria&#x27;s own stock. Including four bulls, this herd is credited with establishing the American Angus breed.

The colony occupied a roughly 10 mile-wide swath land sections from the tracks south to the Smoky Hill River.
With the settlement named Victoria to honor the Queen, the Kansas Pacific Railroad immediately constructed a relatively elaborate stone station-hotel for the colony. At Grant&#x27;s specification, the Victoria Manor had accommodations befitting gentry waiting for completion of their new homes. The ground floor held a ballroom intended for community gathering. Over 200 Britons arrived in the following years.

Grant brought British architect Robert William Edis to the colony to design his manor house and to lay out his dream town. Grant&#x27;s Villa became a historic landmark, but the ultimate Victoria plat was an unprepossessing 3 by 3 grid of square blocks. Grant also directed the construction of the St. George Episcopal church, a stone building. Completed in 1877, this was the first church built in the county.

Many of the colonists, however, were reputed for being more interested in sports and dancing than in raising livestock, hiring overseers to manage some estates. The home families of the remittance men learned of this and reduced the stipends, driving these colonists to leave. Having lost his fortune, Grant&#x27;s sudden death in 1878 accelerated the departure of others of the colony. Some returned to Britain; others left for South America. Grant was buried before the steps of the St. George Church, which would never be consecrated. After Grant&#x27;s death, the Victoria townsite was platted in 1880 by remaining colonists, particularly Margarat Grant Dunan, niece, caretaker, and executor of the George Grant estate.

Today, the platted church grounds are a largely unoccupied cemetery with a monument to Grant&#x27;s contribution to American Angus breeds.

While most of the English left, certain Scottish families remained, notably the descendants of Grant as well as the Philips, four of whom served as Mayor of Hays.

=== Herzog ===
:&quot;This section covers the Volga German settlement of Herzog. For the broader history of Russian-German immigrants in Ellis County, see Ellis County History, English and Russian-German immigrants.&quot;

In 1875, a party of Volga Germans from villages near Saratov, Russia, seeking a place to establish traditional farming villages, were shown locations in Ellis County. The first location, the clay-soiled Ellis County &quot;Hogback&quot; was so disappointing that some in the party resolved to return to Russia. But after being shown locations in the eastern half of the county (the future Catherine and Schoenchen/Pfeifer sites), the party established the first Volga-German village in the county one-half mile north of the tracks from the Victoria Station. The original plat registered for the town is named &quot;Herzog or North Victoria&quot;. As the other Volga German villages were formed, Herzog&#x27;s Roman Catholic settlers built a series of churches which culminated in the construction of St. Fidelis Catholic Church, known as &quot;The Cathedral of the Plains,&quot; in 1911. When the German&#x27;s first arrived at the station, Rev. Laing relates, there was only the station-hotel and one other building in Victoria. Herzog grew rapidly and later adopted the station&#x27;s name. Herzog and the smaller Victoria merged to incorporate under the name Victoria in 1913.

Such were the numbers of German-Russian settlers in Ellis County and adjoining Rush County, such was their adoption of western Russian farming practice and community structure, and such was their adoption of Russian dress and elements of Russian language, Kansans referred to these settlements as &quot;Little Russia&quot;. And such was the importance of Herzog that was soon referred to a &quot;Russia Minor&quot;. 

A traditional religious community, Herzog&#x27;s Catholic services were first held in the open around an erected cross, then in the home of Alois Dreiling after it was constructed. A typical two-story, four-room I-frame prairie farmhouse, attendance soon was too much for the flooring to withstand and a wood framed addition was built onto the home to hold church services. This addition is marked as the second church, first Catholic church, built in the county. The growing community soon overwhelmed this facility.

The only Catholic in the Victoria Colony, Sir Walter C. Maxwell had high interest in Herzog and completed a stone church for the town in 1877. This church was overcrowded almost as soon as it was finished.

The Kansas Pacific Railroad donated 10 acres of land for the community&#x27;s religious use in 1879. Father Anthony Mary, who had previous led the construction of many churches, arrived and in November, 1881, and began construction on the original St. Fidelis Church at Herzog. Seating 600 parishioners, construction began in 1880 and the church was consecrated 1884.

Even as this was soon insufficient for the town and the Catholic villages at large, the St. Fidelis Cathedral, &quot;The Cathedral of the Plains,&quot; was constructed over 1908-1911. 

=== Victoria Auxiliary Field ===
In 1942, the U.S. Army built Walker Army Airfield three miles northeast of Victoria. During World War II, thousands were stationed at the airfield, most for training in operation of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber aircraft. The military closed the base in 1946. In 1949, after the formation of the United States Air Force, that service designated the base &quot;Victoria Auxiliary Field&quot;, but never operated the facility.

=== Bypassed by the Interstate ===
Originally, the Golden Belt Road followed by U.S. Highway 40 passed through Victoria. In 1966, construction of Interstate 70 was completed through Ellis County, bypassing the state highway designation and routing its traffic to the north of the town. While the Interstate increased traffic through the general corridor, regional centers such as Hays and Salina found greater expansion in commerce than Victoria.

===Points of interest===
* The Basilica of St. Fidelis, known as &quot;The Cathedral of the Plains&quot;, is located in Victoria. Local Roman Catholic residents, having outgrown a series of church buildings as their population grew, began construction of the church in 1908. Built from native limestone based on plans by noted church architect John T. Comes, St. Fidelis Catholic Church was completed in 1911. William Jennings Bryan gave the church its nickname during a visit in 1912. In June 2014, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salina dedicated the church as a minor basilica, renaming it the Basilica of St. Fidelis.

* Grant Cemetery is a preservation of the gravesites of George Grant and a few others dating to the 1880s on the grounds of the St. George Church, founded by Grant. Every 50 years, the American Aberdeen-Angus Breeders&#x27; Association commemorates the 1873 establishment of the first Aberdeen Angus herd in the United States. For the centennial in 1973, Hays artist installed a limestone sculpture of a Black Angus.

* Railroad Workers Cemetery is a preservation of the gravesites of a party of workers who were killed in 1867 while excavating the approaches to the railroad bridge just to the north. They were killed by Cheyenne Dog Soldiers who rejected the treaty permitting the construction, this action triggering the Battle of the Saline River.

<text>Ellsworth is a city in and the county seat of Ellsworth County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 3,066. Known as a cow town in the 1870s, when the Kansas Pacific Railroad operated a stockyard here for shipping cattle to eastern markets, in the 21st century, it serves as the trading center of the rural county.

==History==

===19th century===
Once called &quot;The Wickedest Cattletown in Kansas&quot;, the city is named for Fort Ellsworth, which was built in 1864. Due to speculation on imminent railroad construction, the population of Ellsworth boomed to over two thousand by the time it was incorporated in 1867. It has since been said, &quot;Abilene, the first, Dodge City, the last, but Ellsworth the wickedest&quot;.

Ellsworth was a bustling cattle town for a time during the late 1860s, when the Kansas Pacific Railroad had a stop and stockyards there. Cattle were driven up from Texas to this point, and then shipped to major markets. Often cowboys had the run of the town. In 1875 Kansas Pacific closed its cattle pens, moving to another location. The cattle trade dwindled to almost nothing by the mid-1880s.

During the late 1860s into the 1870s, Ellsworth was known for being one of the &quot;wickedest&quot; cattle towns, the scene of numerous killings following shootouts between drunken cowboys. The town sported numerous saloons, brothels and gambling halls, with prostitution being rampant. Wild Bill Hickok ran for Ellsworth County Sheriff in 1868, but was defeated by veteran Union Army soldier E. W. Kingsbury. Kingsbury was an effective lawman, but relied on local marshals to patrol the town, as he also had to police the county. Violence in Ellsworth was commonplace among the cowboys and people associated with them. Ellsworth marshal Will Semans was shot and killed on September 26, 1869, while attempting to disarm a rowdy man in a dance hall.
For a time during this period, two small-time outlaws known only as Craig and Johnson began bullying people around the community, often committing armed robbery. After Semans&#x27; murder, they operated openly. Before long, citizens formed a vigilance squad and captured both men, hanging them in a lynching near the Smoky Hill River. Chauncey Whitney, a deputy to Kingsbury, took over following Sheriff Kingsbury&#x27;s departure. Whitney quickly gained a reputation as being both tough and respectable, and was well liked. The scale of business is shown by construction of the Drovers Cottage in 1872. It could accommodate 175 guests, and stable 50 carriages and 100 horses.

Lawman Wyatt Earp claimed to have served in Ellsworth for a short time. He also later claimed to have arrested gunman Ben Thompson there. But Thompson was arrested by Deputy Ed Hogue after his brother Billy Thompson accidentally shot and killed Ellsworth County Sheriff Chauncey Whitney in 1873. Billy Thompson fled, fearing that he would be lynched for the death of the popular sheriff. Thompson was eventually captured and put on trial, but was acquitted in the shooting. Sheriff Whitney, a friend to both Thompsons, had told bystanders before his death that the shooting was an accident.

By the late 1870s the crime rate had dropped dramatically, as fewer cowboys came through after Kansas Pacific closed its stockyard here. Cattle drives were directed to other market cities, such as Dodge City. Ellsworth suffered economically. 

In 1888, the Kansas Midland Railway Company built between Wichita and Ellsworth. The line was purchased in 1900 by the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway (the &quot;Frisco&quot;). The Frisco operated the line for many years, but it has since been abandoned.

===21st century===
Ellsworth has been developing heritage tourism related to its unique 19th-century history. The city and activists have plans to restore Ellsworth&#x27;s Signature Insurance Building for use as the National Drovers Hall of Fame. Funds for the project are being raised party from an annual cattle drive down Main Street and Douglas Avenue; it is one of the few in the United States that is historically accurate.

<text>Holyrood is a city in Ellsworth County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 403.

==History==
Holyrood was founded in 1874 and was established as a city in 1886. The original site of Holyrood was a half-mile south of Holyrood&#x27;s present site. When settlers first moved into the area, dugout houses were the home of choice. The first settlers of Holyrood were Irish, but they were soon followed by people of German and Czech Origin. Some of the first names to appear in the area were Phelan, Corrigan, Schepmann, and Siemsen as noted in the St. Peter Lutheran Church&#x27;s earliest records.

The first post office in Holyrood was established in June 1874, but the name of the post office was spelled Hollyrood. The name was changed on July 26, 1898. The first postmaster was John Corrigan who served for over four years. Corrigan hailed from Holyrood, Ontario, Canada. The name of Holyrood originally comes from Holyrood Abbey, today known as the Abbey and Palace of Holyroodhouse, in Edinburgh, Scotland. Through Corrigan, the town can directly trace its name to the town of Holyrood, Ontario, Canada, a town settled by Scottish people.

During the first several decades of Holyrood&#x27;s existence, church worship was held in the homes of local farmers, funerals were at the home of the deceased, and marriages were performed in the home of the bride&#x27;s parents. In 1883, the first church of Holyrood was organized: the St. Peter&#x27;s Lutheran Church. The first building for the Lutheran congregation was built one mile southeast of Holyrood. In 1908, the parsonage was moved into town.

To meet the needs of the Catholic settlers, St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church was constructed. Date of construction is given as both 1886 and 1889. The Church was originally called The Church of the Holy Rood (Cross), but the name was later changed.

Next came the St. Paul&#x27;s Evangelical church. Land for this church was bought on March 27, 1892, and constructing of the church was finished in September 1892. The church served its purpose for 35 years until it was dismantled and a new brick church was constructed in its place. The church was later renamed the United Church of Christ.

The first official school of Holyrood opened its doors in 1895 and catered to first through ninth grade. Before then, school was held in the homes of settlers or at the Lutheran Church. In 1906, a new school was constructed followed by another new elementary school in 1930. Holyrood High School was established in 1920.

Holyrood has had two local newspapers: The Holyrood Banner and the Holyrood Gazette. One of the most well known columns in the Holyrood Gazette was written by Leonard Sekavec and was known as &quot;Sek&#x27;s Appeal.&quot; The columns written by Sekavec had not only been printed in the Gazette, but also had been quoted in other newspapers including ones from New York and Los Angeles. Sekavec wrote the column for forty years and was also the editor of the Holyrood Gazette.

The city&#x27;s current slogan is &quot;A Little City with Lots of Pride.&quot;

<text>Kanopolis is a city in Ellsworth County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 443. It was built on the site of Fort Harker, a United States Army post that housed infantry and cavalry troops involved in the Indian Wars from 1867 to 1872.

==History==

===Early history===

For millennia, the Great Plains of North America were inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th to 18th centuries, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, by the Treaty of Fontainebleau. In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized under the provisions of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1867, Ellsworth County was established, which included the land for Kanopolis.

===Pre-Kanopolis===
Fort Ellsworth was the first frontier fort established in the Kanopolis area. It was built by the United States Army in August 1864 at the junction of the Fort Riley-Fort Larned Road and the Smoky Hill Trail, near the Smoky Hill River. Its purpose was to protect construction of the Union Pacific railroad from Native American raids. In November, 1866 Fort Ellsworth changed its name to Fort Harker after the death of General G.H. Charles Harker, who was killed in battle in 1864.

By this time, the fort had grown in importance as a military staging post and supply depot for forts further west, and needed to expand to continue meeting its mission. As a result, on November 17, 1866, the Army ordered the construction of a new fort approximately three-quarters mile east of the current location. The original Fort Ellsworth was closed in early 1867, and the community of Ellsworth was founded in its place.

In January 1867, Fort Harker was relocated approximately three-quarters mile east of the old location to an open prairie about one mile north of the Smoky Hill River. This new location featured a &quot;large, well-equipped&quot; hospital,&quot; which housed those were ill. The hospital was surely busy, as about 200 people died in 1867 from cholera in and around the Fort Harker area. For the next five years, Fort Harker became one of the most important military stations west of the Missouri River.[cite the Guardhouse national register nomination] It used 700 soldiers and twice as many civilian employees, as well as 400 horses and mules. Additionally, the mail to all military posts down the Arkansas river, as well as many posts in Colorado and New Mexico, was supplied from Fort Harker.

Over the coming years, the threat of Native American raids in the region diminished as territory was secured and railroad construction moved west. No longer of geographic significance, Fort Harker was abandoned on April 2, 1872 and the war department ordered it to be closed shortly thereafter. Its garrison was relocated west to Fort Hays. In the winter of 1872-1873, Fort Harker briefly stationed troops once more before being deserted one final time. In the following years, Fort Harker became the &quot;Fort Harker Military Reservation&quot;.

===Kanopolis begins===
In June 1880, the Senate passed bill S.194, an act disposing Fort Harker Military Reservation of public ownership and giving the 10,240 acre tract of land to the Interior Department for sale. A Dr. Hodge acquired the land and sold it to Col. Henry Johnson for $4,177.50 in August, 1881. In summer of 1885, a seventeen-member group of capitalists based in Ohio led by Ross Mitchell (president), F.M. Bookwalter (vice president), and John H. Thomas (treasurer) purchased 4,740 acres of the land, including Fort Harker and its buildings, for $71,000 from Col. Johnson. Imagining their newly acquired land would soon become a &quot;Central Metropolis,&quot; and a future capitol because of its location, the group became chartered as the Kanopolis Land Company on March 15, 1886, with a capital stock of $500,000. They laid out land for 150,000 people, and shortly after, the town of Kanopolis was founded.

===Optimism and boosterism===
The Kanopolis Land Co., with editor R.V. Morgan, advertised in other newspapers and in a paper of their own called The Kanopolis Journal to attract buyers to Kanopolis. These advertisements serve as examples of the boosterism characteristic of the frontier west. One from May 1886 proclaimed Kanopolis &quot;is destined to be the railroad, commercial, and manufacturing capital of Kansas&quot; and said buying land in Kanopolis is the &quot;Best investment in the world.&quot; Another in July 1887 declared it to be the only town in the state with railroads running north, south, east, and west and also claimed to have seven factories, thirteen stores, and a hotel. It reported the population to be 600 when the town was &quot;scarcely&quot; one year old.

More hyperbolic than the advertisements in other newspapers was &quot;The Kanopolis Journal&quot;. It boasted Kanopolis to have &quot;woolen mills, iron factories, carriage works, flour mills, wholesale houses, banks, a drug store, and an opera house, doctors, and machine shops,&quot; as well as a brewery. Additionally, the journal predicts Kanopolis would soon be the furniture hub of the midwest, saying it &quot;is not one-half the distance from a limitless supply of walnut, oak, ash, poplar and all lumber needed in the manufacture of furniture as is Grand Rapids, Michigan, which owes its prosperity to the furniture business.&quot; It said that in forty years it will have 500,000 inhabitants, as it had already &quot;grown as populous as Cincinnati did in eleven years or Cleveland did in thirty years.&quot; 
The journal also describes giant potatoes, cabbage leaves that &quot;are used for circus tents,&quot; jack rabbits that &quot;grow as large as horses,&quot; and pea pods that &quot;are used as ferry boats on the Arkansas river.&quot; It also claims &quot;A man planted a turnip one mile from the railroad last summer and the company sued him for obstructing the track before the middle of July.&quot; Additionally, the journal says that &quot;North of Kanopolis are several lakes of strained honey, and we also often have showers of rosewater and cologne in the early spring.&quot; The journal even says the area around Kanopolis is the real garden of Eden, and that there is a fig tree that Eve herself used to make her first clothes, and that the tree is &quot;like our flag - it is still there, and furnishes evidence which our oldest inhabitants dare not dispute... This settlement of Western Kansas is restoring Eden to its primitive glory and men to their first estate.&quot;

===Shy of expectations===
Kanopolis, for a variety of reasons, never became the &quot;Queen City of the Midwest&quot; that its backers &quot;ballyhooed&quot; it would become. Perhaps its biggest injury was when it lost a referendum by 75 votes to become the seat of Ellsworth County. Also, it had some contemporary antagonists. An editorial in a January 1887 paper from the Leavenworth Times calls Kanopolis a &quot;buffalo wallow,&quot; a &quot;scheme,&quot; and a &quot;fraud&quot; from an &quot;eastern syndicate&quot;. A lawsuit between the Kanopolis Land Co. and R.V. Morgan in 1895 ensued, likely detracting from the company&#x27;s ability to advertise and sell land. By 1906, Kanopolis&#x27; population had fallen to 264.

<text>Wilson is a city in Ellsworth County, Kansas, United States. The community promotes itself as the &quot;Czech Capital of Kansas&quot; due to the role of Czech immigrant settlers in its early history. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 859.
