<text>Tracy is the second most populated city in San Joaquin County, California, United States. The population was 93,000 at the 2020 census. Tracy is located inside a geographic triangle formed by Interstate 205 on the north side of the city, Interstate 5 to the east, and Interstate 580 to the southwest.

==History==

Until the 1760s, the area that became the city of Tracy was long populated by the Yokuts ethnic group of loosely associated bands of Native Americans and their ancestors. They lived on hunting and gathering game and fish from local rivers and creeks. After encountering the Spanish colonists, the Yokuts suffered from new infectious diseases, which caused social disruption, as did the Spanish efforts to impress them into labor at Mission San José. Mexican and American explorers later arrived, pushing the Yokuts out. The Yokuts people remain, living in small groups with about 2,600 people identifying as Yokut. Along with them, another language group of Native Americans found near Tracy are referred to as the Mono people, numbering around 1,800.

Tracy is a railroad town that came from the mid-19th century construction, mainly by Chinese laborers, of Central Pacific Railroad rail lines running from Sacramento through Stockton to the San Francisco Bay Area, beginning 1868 and ending September 1878 with the opening of a new branch and junction. A number of small communities sprang up along these lines at designated station sites, including one at the junction named for railroad director J. J. Tracy.

Incorporated in 1911, Tracy grew rapidly and prospered as the center of an agricultural area, even when larger railroad operations began to decline in the 1950s. Competition with trucking and automobiles resulted in widespread railroad restructuring. Tracy is part of the San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland, CA Combined Statistical Area, an extension of the Bay Area.

In December 1969, the town of Tracy hosted the Altamont Free Concert, held at the later closed Altamont Raceway Park. An estimated 300,000 people gathered at the speedway infield in an event that was plagued by violence among attendees, many of whom were drunk or drugged. Artists featured included the British Rolling Stones and the California bands Santana, Jefferson Airplane, the Flying Burrito Brothers and Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young.

Tracy was the headquarters of a branch of the American Nazi Party. Increased activity was reported by the media in 1972, with the appearance of graffiti spray-painted Nazi swastikas and the words &quot;White Power&quot;. A surplus army 2½-ton 6×6 truck with swastika symbols was seen carrying neo-Nazi recruits around town. Members handed out flyers printed with &quot;Join the National Socialist White People’s Party&quot; and a Tracy-based post office box mailing address. The television program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; aired a report in 1978 titled &quot;The California Reich&quot; with an interview of a Tracy resident who was a neo-Nazi leader. After about a decade, most of the city&#x27;s neo-Nazis moved to Oroville, California.

On August 7, 1998, a tire fire ignited at S.F. Royster&#x27;s Tire Disposal south of Tracy at 29425 South MacArthur Drive, near Linne Road. The tire dump held more than 7 million illegally stored tires and was allowed to burn for over two years before it was extinguished. Allowing the fire to burn was considered to be a better way to avoid groundwater contamination than putting it out. The cleanup of chemicals released by the fire cost $16.2 million. The chemicals were found to have contaminated groundwater in the region.

==Geography==

Located in the Central Valley, Tracy is near both fertile and (due to a region of hills west of Tracy) infertile agricultural lands. Tracy has a Mediterranean climate.

Some of this land (in the east and mostly north of Tracy because of the moist Delta river system) has come under increasing development pressure. The San Francisco Bay Area&#x27;s vigorous population growth has spilled over into the Tracy area as well as other locations, such as the new town of Mountain House. Tracy passed Measure A in 1990 in an attempt to contain and limit development.

In an effort to reduce environmental impacts of the city, it launched the Emerald Tracy Project in September 2009. City spokesman Matt Robinson said that if it succeeds, Tracy will be the second city after Riverside, California to satisfy the state&#x27;s goal for sustainable communities.

==Arts and culture==
=== Historical monuments ===

Tracy City Hall and Jail was first commissioned by the city in November–December 1899 and completed in March 1900 after the original Jail and city hall was burnt down. This historical site served as the local governments place of operation during Tracy&#x27;s formative years, which makes this building an integral part of Tracy&#x27;s foundation. The structure is made of a simple brick building that is 24 by 43 feet in dimension located on 25 West Seventh Street, and was built by J.F. Hoerl. In the historical resources inventory, the Tracy City Hall and Jail was one of only fourteen buildings to receive and &quot;exceptional&quot; rating.

The Tracy Inn was originally opened in 1927 with a total of 60 rooms on the second floor and is still located on 24 West Eleventh Street. The building has a very transitional architectural style befitting the 1920s with a classic Spanish Colonial revival and modern styles mixed together. The building was designed by the Oakland firm of Slocomhe and Tuttle. In 1949, after the ownership changed, the Tracy Inn suffered with a fire that burned the only original blue prints of the building. Even with this loss the owner was still able to recreate the original look of the Tracy Inn. The iconic sign of the Tracy Inn has also been replaced in 1945.

<text>Arroyo Grande (Spanish for &quot;Big Creek&quot;) is a town in San Luis Obispo County, California, United States. 

==History==
The earliest inhabitants of Arroyo Grande Valley were the northern or Obispeno Chumash Indians. The Arroyo Grande area was still occupied by the Chumash at the time of contact with the first Spanish explorer, Juan Cabrillo. During the colonial settlement of California, the Arroyo Grande Valley became separated into two major ranchos which were granted by the Mexican government around 1840. 

In 1862, the San Luis Obispo Board of Supervisors established the township of Arroyo Grande. Businesses developed along a road called Branch Street to serve local agriculture. A railroad depot was built in 1882. The city of Arroyo Grande was incorporated on July 10, 1911.

Arroyo Grande experienced rapid growth in the 1970s and 1980s, partially due to the expansion of the wastewater treatment plant, under an EPA Clean Water Grant, that removed a growth constraint. This federal grant program required preparation of an Environmental Impact Report, which provided much of the initial environmental database for Arroyo Grande.

==The Village==
The downtown area of Arroyo Grande is known as &quot;The Village&quot;. It is where visitors and residents gather for events, festivals and farmer’s markets. In the center&#x27;s Centennial Park is the Swinging Bridge. The Swinging Bridge was originally constructed in early 1875 by the Short family, whose land was divided by the Arroyo Grande Creek. The bridge spans a total length 171 feet and is suspended 40 feet above the creek. It is owned and maintained by the city of Arroyo Grande and is the only one of its kind in California.

The Village corridor includes historic buildings dating back to the 1800’s.

<text>Atascadero (Spanish for &quot;Mire&quot;) is a city in San Luis Obispo County, California, United States, located on U.S. Route 101. Atascadero is part of the San Luis Obispo-Paso Robles metropolitan statistical area, which encompasses the extents of the county. Atascadero is farther inland than most other cities in the county, and as a result, usually experiences warmer, drier summers, and cooler winters than other nearby cities such as San Luis Obispo and Pismo Beach. The main freeway through town is U.S. 101. The nearby State Routes 41 and 46 provide access to the Pacific Coast and the Central Valley of California.

Founded by E. G. Lewis in 1913, the city grew to 29,773 people as of 2020. Atascadero State Hospital is located in the city.

== History ==


The Spanish word loosely means &quot;bog&quot; or &quot;mire&quot;, from the verb , which means &quot;to become stuck or hindered&quot;. On the other hand, in the Obispeño language, the site was named , which translates into a &quot;place of much water&quot;.

The area was originally home to the Chumash and Salinan Native Americans. Between 1769 and 1823, the Spanish Franciscans established 21 missions along the California coast, including the nearby Mission San Miguel Arcángel and Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa. In 1821, Mexico won its independence from Spain, and California became the Mexican province of Nueva California (later Alta California). In 1833, the Mexican government secularized the mission lands. Mexican governor Juan Alvarado granted Rancho Atascadero to Trifon Garcia in 1842, and Pio Pico granted Pedro Estrada Rancho Asuncion in 1845. Patrick Washington Murphy held ownership of at one time.

Edward Gardner Lewis, a magazine publisher from the East, founded Atascadero in 1913 as a utopian, planned colony. He had previously created such a community at University City, Missouri. After purchasing the Atascadero Ranch in 1912, Lewis put together a group of investors, paid J.H. Henry , and celebrated acquisition of the ranch on July 4, 1913. As investors came to homestead the land that they had bought with their down payments, the area was transformed into a &quot;tent city&quot;, with tents situated on land now occupied by Century Plaza and Bank of America. Lewis employed the services of experts in agriculture, engineering and city planning to develop his dream colony for the anticipated 30,000 residents. In 1914, the land was surveyed and subdivided. Beginning with the 1914 deed, sale of all land in Atascadero was restricted to only whites. Thousands of acres of orchards were planted, a water system was installed, and construction began on an road (now Highway 41 west) through the Santa Lucia Mountains to the ocean (Morro Bay), where Lewis built cottages and a beachfront hotel called the Cloisters.

The first civic building in Atascadero, the Atascadero Press Building, had the first rotogravure presses west of Chicago. Lewis then published the Atascadero News newspaper and the Illustrated Review, a photo/news magazine. The centerpiece of Lewis&#x27; planned community was an Italian Renaissance-style building, which was the home to Atascadero City Hall and the Museum until it was damaged in the 2003 earthquake. After significant upgrades and renovations, the building was reopened in August 2013. Built between 1914 and 1918 with bricks made from local clay, this unique and beautiful building has become one of California&#x27;s Historical Landmarks (No. 958).

Founded in 1913 by Edward Gardner Lewis and incorporated in 1979, the Atascadero Colony as it was known at the time was originally envisioned as a model community. Little evidence of Atascadero&#x27;s original architecture and urban design remain, as historic buildings and homes have been torn down to make way for more modern developments and the Sunken Gardens bisected by U.S. Route 101. One of the few surviving examples of original urban design can be found, however, in the Rotunda Building located near the junior high school on Palma Avenue in the Sunken Gardens public park. Designed by Walter D. Bliss of San Francisco, construction was completed in 1918 at a cost of $180,000. It was the headquarters for the Atascadero Colony, built of reinforced concrete and locally produced brick, it had also served as a private school for boys, a veteran&#x27;s memorial building, and county offices. At 6500 Palma Ave., this building was purchased by San Luis Obispo County in the 1950s as a Memorial Building. The building housed the county library, Atascadero Historical Social Museum and then the city offices following incorporation in 1979. The historic city hall is adorned with a dome atop the third story, originally intended to house the library. The building was designated a California Historical Landmark. The city hall was damaged by the magnitude 6.5 San Simeon earthquake on the morning of December 22, 2003.

Another example of Atascadero&#x27;s early architecture is the Carlton Hotel, built in 1929, located just west of the Sunken Gardens on El Camino Real, the city&#x27;s main commercial street. Vacant since 1987, the building was rejuvenated, costing an estimated $15 million and completed in 2003.

The Skytherm house was developed in Atascadero. This private home pioneered solar powered cooling and heating using an integrated rooftop water system. Solar roof ponds are unique solar heating and cooling systems developed by Harold Hay in the 1960s. A basic system consists of a roof-mounted water bladder with a movable insulating cover. This system can control heat exchange between interior and exterior environments by covering and uncovering the bladder between night and day. When heating is a concern the bladder is uncovered during the day allowing sunlight to warm the water bladder and store heat for evening use. When cooling is a concern the covered bladder draws heat from the building&#x27;s interior during the day and is uncovered at night to radiate heat to the cooler atmosphere. The Skytherm house in Atascadero uses a prototype roof pond for heating and cooling.

==Geography==

<text>Cambria () is a seaside village in San Luis Obispo County, California, United States midway between San Francisco and Los Angeles along California State Route 1 (Highway 1). The name Cambria, chosen in 1869, is the Latin name for Wales (Welsh, &quot;Cymru&quot;). Cambria is situated amidst Monterey pines in one of only three such native forests. The town previously had gone by the names of Slabtown, Rosaville, San Simeon, and Santa Rosa.

For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined the unincorporated community as a census-designated place (CDP). The CDP of Cambria had a population of 5,678 at the 2020 census, down from 6,032 at the 2010 census.

== Name ==
A tribal site on present-day Cambria was named &quot;tsɨtkawayu&quot;, Obispeño for &quot;Place of the horses&quot;. The American settlement was originally known as Slabtown, with the town later known as Cambria centered at the Leffingwell cove of today&#x27;s northern Moonstone Beach, which beach also featured a wharf. . 

Because lumber production, ranching activities and mercury mining increased in the area, the village adopted the more dignified name of Cambria. Locals seem to agree that the name was contributed by a local surveyor from Cambria County, Pennsylvania, because the local topography and flora reminded him of that place. 

However this differs from Onomastic data published in several other sources. A 1960 study of California place names, often contemporarily quoted elsewhere states &quot;A Welshman named Llewellyn dubbed his shop &#x27;The Cambria Carpenter Shop,&#x27; and in 1869, the good folks adopted it as the official name.&quot; Forty-three years prior to that, the &quot;History of San Luis Obispo County and environs&quot; contains a similar account: 

==History==
===Local tribes===
The earliest human settlement of this area is known to be associated with prehistoric habitation by the Native American Chumash peoples, who harvested along the coastal area, with emphasis upon sites that were close to rivers.

Although recorded history of the tribes in this region does not begin until the explorers and missionaries arrived, there is evidence of many tribal settlements in the area later known as Cambria. It is estimated that as many as 30,000 people inhabited the area in the time (some 1,000 years) before the Spanish arrived. Experts believe these tribes to have been migratory and used Cambria as a seasonal settlement; other scientists are convinced that they lived there permanently. Most agree that they fed themselves with shellfish and seafood, as well as obtaining food from travels inland to hunt and gather seeds. 

A variety of artistically-crafted implements have been discovered, including spears points and arrowheads made from obsidian; basalt, sandstone, and granite were used to make mortars and pestles; soapstone kettles and stone hammers were also found. These early inhabitants were skilled basket and net makers and fashioned jewelry from crab claws, abalone shells, and the teeth of sharks and whales. The presence of soapstone (steatite) provides evidence that they traded with the Catalina Island tribes, whereas the lack of metals and glass indicates that they did not trade with Europeans or Asians.

===Early settlers and quicksilver===
The first recorded visit by Europeans took place in 1769 when the Portola expedition, coming overland from the south, visited the area. The Spanish explorers camped near the present site of the Coast Union High School, on Santa Rosa Creek, on September 10, 1769, and again on December 24–25, spending the first Christmas in what later became known as Cambria. The Spanish soldiers named the site &quot;El Osito&quot;, because the local Chumash people offered them a young pet bear (which they politely refused). Gifts of food (pinole and fish) were particularly welcome on their return journey, because food supplies were running short.

Cambria is located on the Rancho Santa Rosa Mexican land grant given in 1841 to Julian Estrada.

Settlers were drawn to the area because of the fertile land, streams, and lumber. Additionally, miners were attracted to the area by the 1862 discovery of cinnabar, an ore from which mercury can be extracted. For a while, Cambria was a boom town, with $280,000 worth of mercury shipped out of San Simeon between 1867 and 1870.

During several years Cambria was a booming mine town, and prospectors flooded the area. More than 150 claims were filed in the early 1870s. The most successful of these claims, the Oceanic Quicksilver Mining Company, at one time employed 300 and was the largest mine in the area and the sixth largest in the world. Three furnaces were built, seven tunnels completed, and their stock price jumped to $30.00 per share. Hopes were high, and Cambria residents dreamed of imminent wealth. Unfortunately, by 1878, mercury prices started to fall and Cambria&#x27;s first economic boom ended. As mercury prices fluctuated, Cambria&#x27;s mining thrived and dwindled. During the boom of 1876, $282,832 worth of quicksilver was produced; four years later, production had decreased to only $6,760. A devastating fire in 1889 virtually ended the mercury business and Cambria settled into a quiet dairy community.

====Hearst Castle and SS &quot;Montebello&quot;====

Cambria has benefited greatly from the building of Hearst Castle. During the high unemployment years of the Great Depression, many Cambria citizens found welcome employment in construction. Additionally, Cambria provided supplies, services, and accommodations for many who came to build the Castle, creating prosperity in Cambria in an otherwise less prosperous decade.

War affected Cambria when the 8,000 ton Union Oil tanker SS &quot;Montebello&quot; was attacked and sunk by a Japanese submarine in the early morning of 23 December 1941. Cambria citizens rallied to the rescue and all six crewmen were saved. According to the captain, Olaf Eckstrom, these citizens of Cambria were real heroes: &quot;&quot;God Bless &#x27;em — they performed like American seamen, orderly, efficient, without hysteria&quot;.&quot; 
The historic Old Santa Rosa Chapel, which was built in 1870, and as one of the oldest churches in the county of San Luis Obispo, held Catholic mass until 26 May 1963. The church fell into neglect until 1978, when the chapel and cemetery were restored.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land.

===Climate===
Cambria has a warm-summer (csb) Mediterranean climate typical for the coastal regions of southern California, experiencing an Indian summer with the warmest days in August and September. Winters are cool and wet with mild days, chilly nights, and great rainfall. Summers are warm and dry with sometimes hot days, cool nights, and almost no rainfall. Fog is common.

== Tourism ==

The primary economic activity of Cambria is tourism. Located on the Pacific Ocean, the area has both rocky cliffs and beaches. The town and adjacent hills are known for the extensive Monterey pines that give the area a particular character. The 2012–2014 drought severely affected the forests, with estimates that as many as 40% of the trees were dying.

There are many bed and breakfast inns and hotels, especially along Moonstone Beach Drive. One visiting author described seeing &quot;many impressive homes of highly imaginative design&quot; and encouraged a casual tour of the residential district. The beach is home to various sea life such as seals and sea otters and tide pools filled with sea anemones, sea urchins, sea stars, crabs, snails, and more. The beach was named after the moonstones that wash ashore there. Moonstone Beach Boardwalk is a walk with several beach access points and benches to allow for sea life observation and beach combing.

Hearst Castle is located approximately six miles north, and the Northern elephant seal rookery at Piedras Blancas is some fifteen miles to the north. Cambria is home to the Cambria Historical Museum in the historic East Village and to the California State Historical Landmark No 939, Nitt Witt Ridge.

== Parks and recreation ==
Cambria offers a variety of recreational activities such as bicycling and hiking. Local beaches offer a venue to boogie board, surf, and skimboard. Ocean fishing is conducted off area beaches. Local kayak fishing tours are available.

===Protected areas===
The Fiscalini Ranch Preserve (formerly known as the East-West Ranch) is a 430 acre park that separates Cambria&#x27;s East and West Villages; it protects over a mile of spectacular Pacific Ocean coastline. The Fiscalinis were pioneering Italian Swiss dairymen, who moved into the Cambria region in the 1880s; they acquired a number of dairy farms, including what they called the Town Ranch. The Fiscalini family donated small plots of the Town Ranch as building sites for the Cambria public library, the Veterans Memorial, and a museum. By the 1970s, the Fiscalini heirs, facing an inheritance tax of over one million dollars, sought a buyer, preferably a non-profit organization. None came forth, and in 1979 they sold the property to a developer, who went bankrupt in 1989 after failing to win approval of his ambitious development plans. The Fiscalini property was then sold for three million dollars to wealthy investors in the early 1990s. However, their development plans were also rejected, and in 2000 they sold the property to the American Land Conservancy. The park is managed by the Cambria Community Services District.

===Marine protected areas===
Cambria State Marine Conservation Area and White Rock (Cambria) State Marine Conservation Area are marine protected areas off the coast of Cambria. Much like other underwater parks, the marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.

==Geology==
Cambria is built on the Cambria Slab, a 5,000 ft. thick late-Cretaceous sandstone in a rather enigmatic geologic setting, completely surrounded by Franciscan Formation rocks, mostly mélange. The Cambria Slab extends from Villa Creek in Estero Bluffs State Park to San Simeon Creek, holding up the high coastal ridge between Cayucos and San Simeon State Park. The sandstones are massively bedded. Bedding is only occasionally visible, as at the Leffingwell Landing bridge on Moonstone Beach. Compositionally, they are a feldspathic graywacke. The rocks in places are distorted and sheared (for example, below the high bluff at the north end of Moonstone Beach), and in a few areas injected by Franciscan mélanges and serpentinites (as on the beach below the high bluff at the north end of the Bluff Trail in the Fiscalini Ranch preserve). The Slab was deposited in an area of active subduction during the plate-tectonic assembly of today&#x27;s coastal California.
==Government==
In the state legislature Cambria is in , and in .

In the United States House of Representatives, Cambria is in .

== Education ==
Cambria is home to the Coast Unified School District. The Coast Unified has one K-5 elementary school, one 6–8 middle school, one traditional 9–12 high school, Coast Union High School, and one alternative high school. The District also serves the communities of San Simeon to the north and Cayucos to the south (grades 9–12) as well as the surrounding rural areas.

===Coast Union High School===
Coast Union High School, home of the Broncos, is a very small public high school located on the farmland of Cambria. It typically enrolls around 150 students, all active in FFA, school clubs, athletics, and many other school activities.

====Athletics====
Although known for its very small enrollment, Coast Union does perform well in sports. The girls volleyball team has won two CIF Southern Section Championships: in 1993&#x27;s Division VI and 2011&#x27;s Division 5A. CUHS also won the sectional 1978 title in the 8-man football division. The school has also won numerous league championships.

Two of the town&#x27;s most recent NCAA Division I products include Quentin Cate, a former Horizon League Baseball Player of the Week, and Jeb Heavenrich, a football player for Princeton.

==Infrastructure==
The community gets its water supply from wells that tap San Simeon and Santa Rosa creeks. The area is vulnerable to shortages due to the reliance on an unstable network of creeks, lakes and State Water Project allocations. The Cambria Community Services District is building a treatment plant to treat brackish water and return it to the aquifer. The water is a combination of groundwater, percolated wastewater treatment plant effluent, mixed with fresh water and salt water. The $9.13 million water treatment plant has critics who contend it will damage the delicate ecosystem, particularly San Simeon Creek lagoon, and burden ratepayers for years.

<text>Cayucos (Spanish for &quot;Canoes&quot;) is an unincorporated coastal town in San Luis Obispo County, California, along California State Route 1 between Cambria to the north and Morro Bay to the south. The population was 2,505 at the 2020 census, down from 2,592 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The area was settled by the Chumash people approximately 11000 to 10000 BC. It included a large village to the south of Cayucos at Morro Creek.

The first European land exploration of Alta California, the Spanish Portolà expedition, camped in the vicinity of today&#x27;s Cayucos on September 9, 1769. Coming from the previous campsite near Morro Bay, Franciscan missionary and expedition member Juan Crespi noted in his diary that &quot;In the four hours that we traveled, making at the most three leagues, we encountered eight arroyos by which the water from the mountains runs to the sea, along whose edge we traveled. We halted at the eighth watering place in a moderately broad valley, into which enters an estuary fed by an arroyo of good water coming from the mountains.&quot; Crespi translator Herbert Bolton noted the camp location as Ellysley Creek (further along the coast to the northwest), but the description sounds more like Cayucos.

Cayucos is named for the cayuco, a Spanish name for a small canoe. It was named after the canoes used by the Chumash people to fish in the bay, particularly in the rich kelp beds just north of the current Cayucos pier. The town took its name from the old Rancho Moro y Cayucos, a Mexican land grant awarded in 1842 that includes the present area of the town.

In 1867, Captain James Cass settled on of this land, and founded the town of Cayucos. Cass began developing the area with his business partner, Captain Ingals. Cass built a 900-foot pier and a warehouse to house cargo bound for San Francisco or Los Angeles. Eventually Cass returned to life on the sea and in 1875 real estate developer C.H. Phillips subdivided and sold the remaining portions of Rancho Moro y Cayucos. The original pier was swept away by a storm but has since been rebuilt.

On December 7, 1987, Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 1771, bound from Los Angeles International Airport to San Francisco, was cruising above the central California coast when a recently terminated disgruntled USAir employee aboard the plane shot his ex-supervisor, both pilots, a flight attendant and presumably PSA&#x27;s chief pilot, before deliberately inducing a steep nosedive with the aircraft. The aircraft slammed into a hillside just east of Cayucos at . All 43 passengers and crew aboard perished. 

In October 2009, Arthur Frommer&#x27;s &quot;Budget Travel Magazine&quot; listed Cayucos as one of the &quot;Coolest Small Towns in America&quot;.

However, the name seemed redundant so some people sought better names, especially ocean-oriented names.

<doc id="108092" wikidata="Q605491" url="?curid=108092" title="Morro Bay, California">
<text>Morro Bay (&quot;Morro&quot;, Spanish for &quot;Hill&quot;) is a seaside city in San Luis Obispo County, California, United States. Located on the Central Coast of California, the city population was 10,757 as of the 2020 census, up from 10,234 at the 2010 census. The town overlooks Morro Bay, a natural embayment with an all-weather small craft commercial and recreational harbor.

==History ==
The prehistory of Morro Bay relates to Chumash settlement, particularly near the mouth of Morro Creek. At least as early as the Millingstone Horizon thousands of years before present, there was an extensive settlement along the banks and terraces above Morro Creek. A tribal site on present-day Morro Bay was named &quot;tsɨtqawɨ&quot;, Obispeño for &quot;Place of the Dogs&quot;.

The first European land exploration of Alta California, the Spanish Portolá expedition, came down Los Osos Valley and camped near today&#x27;s Morro Bay on September 8, 1769. Franciscan missionary and expedition member Juan Crespí noted in his diary that &quot;we saw a great rock in the form of a round morro&quot;.

The first recorded Filipinos to visit America arrived at Morro Bay on October 18, 1587, from the Spanish galleon &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Esperanza&quot;; one of whom was killed by local Native Americans while scouting ahead.

While governed by Mexico, large land grants split the surrounding area into cattle and dairy ranchos. These ranchos needed shipping to bring in dry goods and to carry their crops, animals, and other farm products to cities.

The town of Morro Bay was founded by Franklin Riley in 1870 as a port for the export of dairy and ranch products. He was instrumental in the building of a wharf which has now become the Embarcadero. During the 1870s, schooners could often be seen at the Embarcadero picking up wool, potatoes, barley, and dairy products.

A subspecies of butterfly, the &quot;Morro Bay Blue&quot; or &quot; Morro Blue&quot; (&quot;Icaricia icarioides moroensis&quot;) was first found at Morro beach, by the entomologist Robert F. Sternitzky, in June 1929.

During World War II, there was a U.S. Navy base, Amphibious Training Base Morro Bay on the north side of Morro Rock where sailors were trained to operate LCVPs. The breakwater on the southwest side of the Rock was built in 1944–45 to protect the LCVPs entering and leaving the harbor. Soldiers from Camp San Luis Obispo would come to Morro Bay and practice loading into the LCVPs. Many of those men were at Normandy on D-Day.

In the 1940s, Morro Bay developed an abalone fishing industry; it peaked in 1957, and stocks of abalone have declined significantly due to overfishing. Halibut, sole, rockfish, albacore, and many other species are still caught by both commercial and sport vessels. In addition, oysters are aquacultured in the shallow back bay.

The Pacific Gas and Electric Company built the Morro Bay Power Plant in the early 1950s, which created jobs and increased the tax base. The city incorporated in 1964. The plant closed in February 2014.

==Geography==
Morro Bay is the name of the large estuary that is situated along the northern shores of the bay itself. The larger bay on which the local area lies is Estero Bay, which also encompasses the communities of Cayucos and Los Osos. The city of Morro Bay is northwest of San Luis Obispo and is located on Highway 1. Los Osos Creek discharges into Morro Bay.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (48.63%) is water.

===Morro Rock===
Morro Rock is a high volcanic plug located at the entrance to the harbor. The descriptive term &quot;morro&quot; is common to the Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian languages, and the word is part of many place names where there is a distinctive and prominent hill-shaped rock formation. Originally, it was surrounded by water, but the northern channel was filled in to make the harbor. It was quarried from 1889 to 1969, and in 1968, it was designated a Historical Landmark.

The area around the base of Morro Rock is open to visitors, with parking lots and paths. Climbing the rock is prohibited due to risk of injury, and because it is a peregrine falcon reserve.

Morro Rock is one in a series of similar plugs that stretch in a line inland called the Nine Sisters.

===Morro Bay Harbor===

Morro Bay is a natural embayment with an artificial harbor constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It is the only all-weather small craft commercial and recreational harbor between Santa Barbara and Monterey. Morro Rock was originally surrounded by water, but the Army built a large artificial breakwater and road across the north end of the harbor, linking Morro Rock and the mainland. Some of the rock used for this and for the artificial breakwaters was quarried from Morro Rock itself. Other rock was imported by barge from Catalina Island. The bay extends inland and parallels the shore for a distance of about south of its entrance at Morro Rock. Morro Bay is recognized for protection by the California Bays and Estuaries Policy.

There is usually a small summer colony of otters in the kelp near the harbor entrance.

===Climate===
Morro Bay experiences a mild warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen Csb) characteristic of coastal California featuring dry, warm summers and wet, mild winters. The city is located next to the Pacific Ocean, which helps moderate temperatures and create an overall pleasant mild year-round climate, resulting in warmer winters and cooler summers compared with places farther inland, such as Atascadero. Summers in Morro Bay are cool for a city located on the 35th parallel north latitude, with July averaging around . Winters are mild, with January averaging at with around 8 days of measurable precipitation.

==Economy==
Tourism is the city&#x27;s largest industry, coexisting with the town&#x27;s commercial fishery. A number of tourist attractions are found along the shoreline and the streets closest to it, especially the Embarcadero, including restaurants, shops and parks. Further, hospitality is the cornerstone of Morro Bay&#x27;s economy. The city heavily relies on visitors staying at hotels as tax revenues from those stays make up a significant portion of the city&#x27;s General Fund. The importance of travelers staying in hotels is solidified by the number and variety of accommodations. Hotels, motels, and inns within Morro Bay continuously adapt to accommodate visitors by investing in their amenities, accommodations, and conditions.

The most popular beach is on the north side of Morro Rock, north of the harbor. There are also excellent beaches north and south of the town, Morro Strand State Beach and Morro Bay State Park, respectively.

===Power plant===
The power plant has played a large role in Morro Bay, and in providing electricity to the Central Coast and the Central Valley of California (primarily Fresno and Bakersfield). The plant was built in the 1950s. The plant was staffed with 44 employees. A portion of the city&#x27;s budget came from taxes on the natural gas the plant burned. Previously owned by Pacific Gas and Electric Co.(PG&amp;E), Duke Energy, and LSPower (PG&amp;E), Dynegy had hoped to modernize it with a new combined cycle plant. The plant was operating at relatively low capacity factors (approximately 5%) under contract with PG&amp;E, due primarily to economics.

Continued operation would have required expensive upgrades by 2015. The 650-megawatt plant operated around the clock during the energy crisis of 2000, but the plant had been operating at just one-sixth of that capacity in the recent years preceding its closure. The modernization proposal was rejected, and the plant closed in February 2014.

In 2018, a joint venture of German energy company EnBW and Seattle-based Trident Winds announced its plan to obtain the power plant&#x27;s grid connection to connect a 650 MW floating offshore wind park comprising up to 100 floating wind turbines and a floating substation situated some off the coast. In 2022, TotalEnergies, a French energy company entered the joint venture with Trident Winds and took over the shares previously held by EnBW.

In 2021, the city council of Morro Bay voted 4–1 to take down the power plant&#x27;s smoke stacks by 2028. The city estimated that maintaining the smoke stacks would cost around a million dollars per year. Vistra Corp agreed to tear down the stacks and plans to build a lithium-ion battery installation.

<text>Nipomo (; Chumash: &quot;Nipumuʔ&quot;) is an unincorporated town in San Luis Obispo County, California, United States. The population was 16,714 for the 2010 census and grew to 18,176 for the 2020 census. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Nipomo as a census-designated place (CDP).

==Name==
The name is the Spanish transliteration of the Obispeño Chumash place name &quot;Nipumuʔ&quot;, meaning &quot;place of the big house&quot; or &quot;village&quot;.

==History ==

The original settlers of Nipomo were the Chumash Indians, who have lived in the area for over 9,000 years. Rancho Nipomo (the Chumash word &quot;ne-po-mah&quot; meant &quot;foot of the hill&quot;) was one of the first and largest of the Mexican land grants in San Luis Obispo County.

William G. Dana of Boston, a sea captain whose travels led him to California, married Maria Josefa Carrillo of Santa Barbara. In 1837, the Rancho Nipomo was granted to Captain Dana by the Mexican governor. The Dana Adobe, created in 1839, served as an important stop for travelers on El Camino Real between Mission San Luis Obispo and Mission Santa Barbara. The adobe was a stage coach stop and became the exchange point for mail going between north and south in the first regular mail route in California. The Danas had several children, thirteen of whom reached adulthood. They learned both English and Spanish, as well as the language of the Chumash natives.

In 1846, U.S. Army Captain John C. Fremont and his soldiers stopped at the rancho on their way south to Santa Barbara and Los Angeles. Captain Dana hosted a barbecue and gave Fremont&#x27;s men 30 fresh horses. By the 1880s the Dana descendants had built homes on the rancho and formed a town. Streets were laid out and lots were sold to the general public. The Pacific Coast Railway (narrow gauge) came to town in 1882, and trains ran through Nipomo until The Great Depression in the 1930s. By the end of 1942, the tracks had been removed for the World War II war effort.

Thousands of Blue Gum Eucalyptus trees were planted on the Nipomo Mesa in 1909 by two men who formed the Los Berros Forest Company with the idea of selling the trees as hardwood. Groves of these non-native trees still exist in rows as they were originally planted.

Nipomo Mesa is the location of one of the most famous photographs of the Great Depression, &quot;Migrant Mother&quot;, by Dorothea Lange.

<text>Pismo Beach (Chumash: &quot;Pismuʔ&quot;) is a city in the southern portion of San Luis Obispo County, in the Central Coast area of California, United States. Its estimated population was 8,072 at the 2020 census, up from 7,655 in the 2010 census. It is part of the Five Cities area, a cluster of cities in that area. The Five Cities area historically is made up of Arroyo Grande, Grover City (now Grover Beach), Halcyon, Fair Oaks, and Nipomo. Now most people refer to the Five Cities as Grover Beach, Pismo Beach, Shell Beach (which is actually a part of Pismo Beach), Arroyo Grande, and Oceano (which is unincorporated county land serviced by the Oceano Community Services District).

==History==

The Chumash people are the historic inhabitants of the region, with indigenous peoples having lived along the California coast for at least 11,000 years. 
The name Pismo comes from the Chumash language word for tar, &quot;pismuʔ&quot;, which was gathered from tar springs in Price Canyon near Pismo Beach. The tar was a valuable product, which the Chumash used to caulk their seagoing canoes, called &quot;tomol&quot;, which traveled along the coast and out to the Channel Islands. The first European land exploration of Alta California, the Spanish Portolá expedition, passed through the area, traveling up Price Canyon from Pismo Beach, where they camped on September 4, 1769. Franciscan missionary and expedition member Juan Crespí noted in his diary that they found a Chumash village near the creek.

Pismo Beach is located on the Rancho Pismo Mexican land grant made to José Ortega, grandson of José Francisco Ortega, in 1840. In 1846, José Ortega sold Rancho Pismo to Isaac Sparks. John Michael Price bought most of the rancho from Sparks. Price established the town of Pismo Beach in 1891. His homestead is now Price Historical Park. His home is a registered historical landmark. Pismo is known as the clam capital of the world. Nearly over 2.5 million people visit Pismo Beach.

The first wharf at Pismo was built in 1882, followed by a full-length pier built in 1924 that was financed and constructed by William Woodrow Ward, who allowed full use of it by the public. After it suffered considerable storm damage, the pier was renovated again in 1985. Pismo State Beach is named for the city of Pismo Beach.

The neighborhoods of Shell Beach and Sunset Palisades were the site of a Chumash village, and significant archeological sites are located in both areas. Shell Beach became agricultural land, mostly pea fields. Developer Floyd Calvert bought and developed the area in 1926. At first, it was a local resort area; after World War II, it became primarily residential. Sunset Palisades, originally called Oilport, was the site of an oil refinery from 1907 until after World War II; it is now residential.

===Clams===
The Pismo clam was named for the long, wide beach where so many were once found, once in such abundance that they were harvested with plows. Clamming once drew thousands of clammers to Pismo during low tides, and is still legal, but due to overharvesting by humans and the protected sea otter (which feasts on clams), few clams are now to be found.

Pismo Beach adopted the name &quot;Clam Capital of the World&quot; in the 1950s, though this motto is no longer used. The city still holds the Clam Festival every October, complete with clam chowder competitions and a clam-themed parade.

At the southern end of Price Street upon first entering Pismo Beach is a gigantic concrete clam statue. The shell of a Pismo clam (&quot;Tivela stultorum&quot;) is on display at the Pismo Beach Chamber of Commerce.

<doc id="108096" wikidata="Q49012" url="?curid=108096" title="San Luis Obispo, California">
<text>; ; ; Chumash: &quot;tiłhini&quot;) is a city and county seat of San Luis Obispo County, in the U.S. state of California. Located on the Central Coast of California, San Luis Obispo is roughly halfway between the San Francisco Bay Area in the north and Greater Los Angeles in the south. The population was 47,063 at the 2020 census.

San Luis Obispo was founded by the Spanish in 1772, when Saint Junípero Serra established Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa. The town grew steadily through the Mexican period before a rapid expansion of San Luis Obispo following the American Conquest of California. San Luis Obispo is a popular tourist destination, known for its historic architecture, vineyards, and hospitality, as well as for being home to California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.

==History==
The earliest human inhabitants of the local area were the Chumash people. One of the earliest villages lies south of San Luis Obispo and reflects the landscape of the early Holocene when estuaries came farther inland. The Chumash people used marine resources of the inlets and bays along the Central Coast and inhabited a network of villages, including sites at Los Osos and Morro Creek. The tribal site on present-day San Luis Obispo was named .

===Spanish period===

During the Spanish Empire expansion throughout the world, specifically in 1769, Franciscan Junípero Serra received orders from Spain to bring the Catholic faith to the natives of Alta California; the idea was to unify the empire under the same religion and language. Mission San Diego was the first Spanish mission founded in Alta California that same year.

On September 7, 1769, an expedition led by Gaspar de Portolá entered the San Luis Obispo area from coastal areas around today&#x27;s Pismo Beach. One of the expedition&#x27;s three diarists, padre Juan Crespí, recorded the name given to this area by the soldiers as &quot;Cañada de Los Osos&quot; (&quot;cañada&quot; translates as &quot;valley&quot; or &quot;canyon,&quot; and Osos translates to &quot;bears&quot;). The party traveled north along San Luis Obispo Creek, turned west through Los Osos Valley, and reached Morro Bay on September 9.

In 1770, Portola established the Presidio of Monterey and Junípero Serra founded the second mission, San Carlos Borromeo, in Monterey. The mission was moved to Carmel the following year.

In 1772, as the people of Presidio of Monterey and San Carlos Borromeo faced starvation, owing to a lack of supplies, Commander Pedro Fages (a member of the Portolà expedition) led a hunting expedition to the &quot;Cañada de Los Osos&quot; to bring back food. Over twenty-five mule loads of dried bear meat and seed were sent north to relieve the missionaries, soldiers, and neophytes (baptized natives). It was after this that Junípero Serra decided that La Cañada de Los Osos would be an ideal place for the fifth mission.

The area had abundant supplies of food and water, the climate was also very mild, and the local Chumash were very friendly. With soldiers, muleteers, and pack animals carrying mission supplies, Junípero Serra set out from Carmel to reach the Valley of the Bears. On September 1, 1772, Junípero Serra celebrated the first Mass with a cross erected near San Luis Creek. The very next day, he departed for San Diego leaving Fr. José Cavaller, with the difficult task of building the mission. Fr. José Cavaller, five soldiers and two neophytes began building the Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa which would later become the town of San Luis Obispo. Both the mission and the town were named after San Luis, obispo de Tolosa (St. Louis, bishop of Toulouse, France).

===Mexican period===
When the Mexican War of Independence from Spain broke out in 1810, all California missions had to become virtually self-sufficient, receiving few funds or supplies from Spanish sources. Beginning soon after Mexico won her independence from Spain in 1821, anti-Spanish feelings led to calls for expulsion of the Spanish Franciscans and secularization of the missions. Because the fledgling Mexican government had many more important problems to deal with than far-off California, actual secularization did not happen until the mid-1830s.

After 1834, the mission became an ordinary parish, and most of its huge land holdings were broken up into land grants called &quot;ranchos&quot;. The ranchos were given by Mexican land grant from 1837 to 1846, with the mission itself being granted in the final year. The central community, however, remained in the same location and formed the nucleus of today&#x27;s city of San Luis Obispo.

===American period===
Following the American Conquest of California, San Luis Obispo was the first town incorporated in the newly formed San Luis Obispo County. It remains the center of the county to the present. Early in the American period, the region was well known for lawlessness. It gained a reputation as &quot;Barrio del Tigre&quot; (or Tiger-Town) because of the endemic problem. Robberies and murders that left no witnesses were carried out on along the El Camino Real and elsewhere around San Luis Obispo for several years. Finally a gang of eight men committed a robbery with three murders and a kidnapping at the Rancho San Juan Capistrano del Camote in May 1858, that uncharacteristically left two witnesses alive. This brought about the formation of a vigilance committee in the County that killed one, the suspected leader of the gang Pio Linares, and lynched six others, a total of seven men suspected of such misdeeds (the most lethal in California history). Members of the committee remained influential members of the community for decades.

The ranchos remained focused on cattle after the conquest of California. With the discovery of gold, the county experienced a major economic surge with the rising price of beef, with the highest prices coming in 1851. The county remained focused on cattle until 1863, when a drought left most ranchos devastated. Residents quickly turned to other venues, leading to the breaking up of many of the ranchos and a major change in the economic climate of the town, which focused less on cattle ranching and more on dairies, agriculture, and mined goods from then onward.

San Luis Obispo once had a burgeoning Chinatown in the vicinity of Palm Street and Chorro Street. Laborers were brought from China by Ah Louis in order to construct the Pacific Coast Railway, roads connecting San Luis Obispo over the Cuesta Pass to Paso Robles and from Paso Robles to Cambria, and also the 1884 to 1894 tunneling through Cuesta Ridge for the Southern Pacific Railroad. The town&#x27;s Chinatown revolved around Ah Louis Store and other Palm Street businesses owned and run by Chinese business people. Today, Mee Heng Low chop suey shop is all that remains of the culture, although a slightly Chinatown-themed commercial development has been planned. A display of some of the unearthed relics from this period can be seen on the first floor of the Palm Street parking garage, which was built over the location where Chinatown once stood. The San Luis Obispo Historical Society (adjacent to the Mission) also contains rotating historical exhibits.

San Luis Obispo was also a popular stop en route to Los Angeles. U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 were constructed with the rise of car culture. Due to its popularity as a stop, it was the location of the first motel in the world, the Milestone Mo-Tel.

==Geography==
San Luis Obispo is located on U.S. Route 101, about north of Santa Maria.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and (1.13%) is water.

San Luis Obispo is on the West Coast of the United States and in the Central Coast of California. The Pacific Ocean is about west of San Luis Obispo. The Santa Lucia Mountains lie just east of San Luis Obispo. These mountains are the headwaters for San Luis Obispo Creek, whose watershed encompasses surrounding the city and flows to the Pacific Ocean at Avila Beach.

San Luis Obispo is a seismically active area; there are a number of nearby faults including the San Andreas Fault. The Nine Sisters are a string of hills that partially run through San Luis Obispo. They are geologically noteworthy for being volcanic plugs. Six of the nine peaks are open to the public for recreation.

===Climate===
San Luis Obispo experiences a warm Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csb&quot;). On average it has 50 days with measurable rain per year, mostly during winter months. Summers are generally warm and sunny, often with morning fog from the Pacific coast. Winters are generally mild, though below freezing lows occur 2.6 nights per year on average. Measurable snowfall in San Luis Obispo has not officially been recorded since records began in 1870, although photos show about fell in 1922 and snow flurries were reported in both 1988 and 2006. Temperatures do, however, vary widely at any time of the year, with readings in January and February not uncommon.

Although heat extremes above have been recorded, the maritime moderation is generally strong due to the proximity to the cool ocean waters. The hottest temperature on record is officially at on September 6, 2020, although a 120 reading was reported in the local news. Nights remain cool year round due to cold-current ocean air in summer and being in a valley subject to inversion, although seldom cold. The warmest night recorded was on September 22, 1939, and the coldest day at on December 11, 1932.

===Notable ordinances===
In June 1990 City Councilman Jerry Reiss proposed a city ordinance to ban smoking in all indoor public areas. Following a failed effort by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company to defeat the ordinance, the City Council voted 4–1 in favor on June 19, 1990, with only Mayor Ron Dunin dissenting. As a result, on August 2, 1990, San Luis Obispo became the first municipality in the world to ban smoking in all public buildings, including bars and restaurants. This statute has been a catalyst worldwide in anti-smoking legislation. In April 2010, San Luis Obispo strengthened its anti-smoking legislation, making smoking in public, excepting for certain conditions, a citable offense beginning on June 20, 2010.

In 1982, following public hearings, the city council approved an ordinance forbidding the construction of &quot;drive-through&quot; businesses. In-N-Out Burger opened a restaurant in the nearby town of Atascadero because of the ban. In 2008 the City Council voted 3–2 to keep the ban.

In April 2010, an &quot;unruly gathering&quot; ordinance passed with a vote of 4–1. This ordinance poses a fine of $700 for the hosts of gatherings with more than 20 people on private property that create a substantial disturbance in a significant amount of the neighborhood.

The doctor&#x27;s office on the corner of Santa Rosa and Pacific streets is one of very few commercial buildings designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. San Luis also has a Carnegie Library which is now home to the San Luis Obispo County Historical Museum.

The &quot;underground city&quot; is a series of tunnels beneath the city.

One of the largest Mardi Gras parades west of the Mississippi was held in San Luis Obispo, but canceled in 2005 because of difficulties related to crowd control and alcohol consumption.

Cal Poly&#x27;s open house, Poly Royal, was held annually from 1933 to 1990, though canceled in 1945 due to war rationing. It began as a show-and-tell for students to display their projects. It traces its origins to the 1904 Farmer&#x27;s Institute and Picnic Basket. By the 1980s, as the college became &quot;the most popular...university in the 19-campus CSU system&quot;, Poly Royal began drawing over 100,000 people from throughout the state, including 126,000 people in 1985. Concerts, parties, and other entertainment were added and it earned $3–4 million in revenue for the city every year.

San Luis Obispo has been home of several other events, including a stop on the way of the Olympic Flame Relay, the Tour of California bicycle race, Cinco de Mayo celebrations, and a long-standing Christmas Parade. In May, the Madonna Hotel hosts the annual California Festival of Beers, which includes beer tasting of over 200 craft beers. Another attraction is the development of Edna Valley into a well-known wine region. Just south of the city, people can spend an afternoon wine tasting several wineries in the area with a very short drive. The wine region extends north beyond Paso Robles (30 miles north) and south to Santa Ynez (70 miles south).

One of the cultural focal centers of San Luis Obispo is the Christopher Cohan Performing Arts Center built on the Cal Poly campus, which was constructed utilizing the donations of local businesses and individuals. The Performing Arts Center consists of multiple venues, including the original Spanos Theatre. The largest venue, Harmon Hall, seats 1,300. Many high school and college programs are scheduled. Local artists perform plays, music and dance. The addition of the Performing Arts Center attracts many touring performances which are usually not found in communities of comparable size to San Luis Obispo. The summer of 2007 was the opening concert of the Forbes Pipe Organ, which was built elevated into a side wall of Harmon Hall and required the donation of a further $3 million for purchase and installation.

The San Luis Obispo Museum of Art began in the 1950s when a small group of artists, educators and enthusiasts established the foundation. Over the years, the San Luis Obispo Art Association evolved into the San Luis Obispo Art Center, which evolved into the San Luis Obispo Museum of Art. The museum, with a focus on California Contemporary Art, shows 24 exhibitions per year, has both adult and children&#x27;s art classes, and hosts art talks, films and other events.

<text>San Miguel (Spanish for &quot;St. Michael&quot;) is a unincorporated community in San Luis Obispo County, California, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population was 2,336. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined San Miguel as a census-designated place (CDP). San Miguel was founded by the Spanish in 1797, when Mission San Miguel Arcángel was established by Fermín de Lasuén. San Miguel is a tourist destination with historic architecture and vineyards, as part of the Paso Robles wine region.

==History==

The area of San Miguel and the rest of the southern Salinas Valley was inhabited by the Salinans, an Indigenous Californian nation.

The Spanish founded the settlement at San Miguel on 25 July 1797, when Fermín de Lasuén established Mission San Miguel Arcángel, under the authority of the Franciscan Order. The site of the mission was specifically chosen due to its proximity to the large number of Salinan villages in the area. The interior of the mission church features murals executed under the direction of the famed artist Esteban Munrás in the 1820s.

The mission&#x27;s location between Mission San Luis Obispo and Mission San Antonio de Padua provided a stop on the trip that had previously taken two days. In 1803, the mission reported an Indian population of 908, while its lands grazed 809 cattle, 3,223 sheep, 342 horses and 29 mules. That year&#x27;s harvest included about 2,186 fanegas of wheat and corn (A fanega was about ). Most of the mission burned, while still being developed, in 1806. It was rebuilt within a year.
The Rios-Caledonia Adobe was built in 1835 just south of Mission San Miguel as a home for the overseer of mission lands. 

On July 15, 1836, following the Mexican secularization of the missions, Mission San Miguel Arcángel was acquired by Ygnacio Coronel, a noted Californio ranchero and politician.

In 1846, Governor Pío Pico sold Mission San Miguel Arcángel for $600 to Petronilo Ríos and William Reed. Reed used the Mission as a family residence and a store. In 1848, Reed and his family were murdered, leaving the Mission vacant for a period of time. The Mission was a stopping place for miners coming from Los Angeles to San Francisco, and, consequently, was used as a saloon, dance hall, storeroom and living quarters.

In 1859, President James Buchanan returned the mission to the Catholic Church. In 1878, after 38 years without a resident priest, Padre Philip Farrelly became the first pastor of Mission San Miguel Arcángel since the secularization. In 1928, Mission San Miguel Arcángel and Mission San Antonio de Padua were both returned to the Franciscan Order, which led to their restorations and repairs.

The 2003 San Simeon earthquake caused severe damage to the sanctuary at Mission San Miguel. The Catholic Church considered closing the parish due to the extensive damage and the estimated $15 million cost of repair; however, the work has since been completed and the mission has since reopened.

In 2011, San Miguel&#x27;s local business community formed the San Miguel Chamber of Commerce in order to promote the village&#x27;s tourism and agricultural industries.

<text>Templeton is a census-designated place (CDP) in San Luis Obispo County, California, United States. The population was 7,674 at the 2010 census, up from 4,687 at the 2000 census.

==Geography and climate==

===Geography===
Templeton is located at (35.553847, −120.709469). It is approximately south of Paso Robles and five miles north of Atascadero along U.S. 101. State Route 46 intersects U.S. 101 on the north edge of the town.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , 99.37% of it land and 0.63% water. However, much of the surrounding unincorporated area between Atascadero and Paso Robles is considered as part of Templeton, with most U.S. mail for this area addressed as such.

===Climate===
Templeton has a Mediterranean climate that is characterized by mild winters and dry summers. The area usually has low humidity. Rain generally falls only between November and March, with the rainy season tapering off almost completely by the end of April. Temperature lows can reach from in the winter, and highs can reach in the summer, with the highest recorded temperature being .

Like much of the nearby area, Templeton occasionally receives significant but temporary fog through parts of the year. In summer, Templeton will occasionally receive fog due to its proximity with the California Coastal Range, Pacific Ocean, and the higher valley temperatures of Templeton itself; the differential in density between the warm rising air in the valley causes it to be displaced with the descent of the cooler marine air layer via the Templeton Gap in the Santa Lucia Range.

==History==
Templeton is located within the former Rancho Paso de Robles Mexican land grant and was founded in 1886 when Chauncey Hatch Phillips of the West Coast Land Company sent R.R. Harris to survey set aside for a town to exist south of Paso Robles as part of the company&#x27;s larger purchase of . These 160 acres were to be laid out in business and residential lots with 5–12 acre parcels, with the town to be named &quot;Crocker&quot; after a Vice President of the Southern Pacific Railroad, Charles F. Crocker; however, Crocker instead chose to name the town &quot;Templeton,&quot; after his two-year-old son, Charles Templeton Crocker.

The town was briefly the end of the line for passengers travelling south via the Southern Pacific Railroad from northern California; passengers disembarked at Templeton and were then carried by stagecoach south to San Luis Obispo. In 1889, the railroad was continued south to Santa Margarita and the town was reclassified to a flag stop. Currently, the railroad stops in nearby Paso Robles before continuing on, and Templeton is classified as a bypass.

In 1898, a fire destroyed most of the original wooden buildings of the business district along Main Street, prompting this section of the town to be rebuilt with brick, although on a somewhat smaller scale than before.

<text>Atherton ( ) is an incorporated town in San Mateo County, California, United States. Its population was 6,823 as of July 2023 estimates. The town&#x27;s zoning regulations permit only one single-family home per acre, and prohibit sidewalks.

Atherton is known for its high concentration of wealth; in 1990 and 2019, Atherton was ranked as having the highest per capita income among U.S. places that have a population between 2,500 and 9,999, and the area covered by its ZIP Code is regularly ranked as having the highest cost of living in the United States. In 2023, the Atherton ZIP Code had the highest median home prices in the United States, at $7,950,000.

== History ==
The entire area was originally part of the Rancho de las Pulgas. 
During the 1860s, Atherton was known as Fair Oaks. In 1923, it was decided to rename the town in honor of Faxon Dean Atherton, a former 19th century landowner on the south peninsula.

=== Lawsuit against the electrification of Caltrain ===
The town has been involved in lawsuits to block or delay the introduction of California High-Speed Rail. Atherton was an early and vocal opponent of the electrification of the U.S. commuter railroad Caltrain, which serves cities in the San Francisco Peninsula and Silicon Valley. Residents opposed electrification and the proposed high-speed rail route because the overhead electrical lines would require tree removal and the town could potentially be divided by the closing of the two grade crossings at Fair Oaks Lane and Watkins Avenue.

In February 2015, shortly after the project received environmental clearance from the state, Atherton sued Caltrain, alleging the agency&#x27;s environmental impact review was inadequate and that its collaboration with the CHSRA should be further vetted. In July 2015, the suit proceeded after Caltrain&#x27;s request to the Surface Transportation Board to exempt it from California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) guidelines was denied. Atherton reiterated its opposition to electrification on the basis that overhead wires would require removing a significant number of heritage trees, and city representatives asserted that &quot;newer, cleaner, more efficient diesel trains&quot; should supplant plans for &quot;century-old catenary electrical line technology&quot;. Atherton mayor Rick De Golia was quoted as saying &quot;Caltrain is locked into an old technology and 20th century thinking&quot;. After Caltrain issued infrastructure and rolling stock contracts in July 2016, Atherton representatives did not file a temporary restraining order to halt those contracts, preferring to let the suit proceed to a hearing. In September 2016, Contra Costa County Superior Court Judge Barry Goode sided with Caltrain, ruling that the electrification project did not hinge on the high-speed rail project&#x27;s success, and was thus independent from the latter.

Atherton sued CHSRA again in December 2016, stating that using bond money intended for high-speed rail for CalMod was a material change in usage and therefore was unconstitutional because such a change would require voter approval first. In response, the California Legislature allowed the funding to be redirected by passing Assembly Bill No. 1889, which had been championed by Assemblymember Kevin Mullin in 2015. Mullin noted &quot;this entire Caltrain corridor is the epicenter of the innovation economy and it&#x27;s a job creation and economic engine. This electrification project, I would argue, is monumental with regard to dealing with [increased traffic and environmental impacts] effectively and efficiently.&quot;

The Caltrain station closed in 2020.

===Land use and housing===
Atherton is the wealthiest city in the United States. According to the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, &quot;the town&#x27;s ascendance stems largely from its single-family zoning, 1-acre-minimum lot sizes, flat land, streamlined permits and changing buyer demographics — which have translated into soaring house sizes and skyrocketing prices.&quot; There is no commercial zoning in the town, thus there are no restaurants, shops or grocery stores. There are no sidewalks in Atherton, only road lanes.

Until 2022, the town&#x27;s zoning regulations permitted only one single-family home per acre and prohibit sidewalks. Partly as a result of these regulations, the average home price in the city in recent years was more than 7.5 million dollars. Many of the inhabitants have strongly opposed proposals to permit more housing construction. Among those include Golden State Warriors player Steph Curry. However, with the passage of SB 9 in 2022, the zoning regulations that limit how many units can be built on a property were nullified.

In 2022, the town blocked a proposal to build 131 multifamily housing units in the town in response to strong criticism of the proposal by the city&#x27;s inhabitants. Advocates for the construction of additional homes have criticized Atherton as being a NIMBY town. In 2022, California Governor Gavin Newsom singled out Atherton in a speech for its restrictive housing policies. The mayor said in 2022 that they were focusing on building affordable housing for staff and teachers at the city&#x27;s eight schools.

In February 2023, the Atherton City Council approved a housing plan with 348 mixed-income housing units. Under California law, the units must be built over the next eight years, and the city must reserve 148 units for occupancy by &quot;very low income&quot; or &quot;low income&quot; individuals, 56 units for &quot;moderate income&quot; individuals, and 144 units for &quot;above moderate income&quot; individuals.

As of November 2022, Atherton&#x27;s stated land-use goal is to &quot;preserve the Town&#x27;s character as a scenic, rural, thickly wooded residential area with abundant open space.&quot;

===Smoking policy===
In January 2009, Belmont adopted an ordinance that bans smoking in city parks, all businesses, and all multi-story apartments and condominiums. The policy, which has been described as perhaps the strictest anti-smoking law in the nation, was the result of a group of retirees lobbying the city to stop secondhand smoke from drifting into their apartments from neighboring places. Public health advocates consider the ordinance to be a new front in a national battle against tobacco; officials from the American Lung Association of California said &quot;Belmont broke through this invisible barrier in the sense that it addressed drifting smoke in housing as a public health issue.&quot;

<doc id="108102" wikidata="Q917671" url="?curid=108102" title="Brisbane, California">
<text>Brisbane (pron. ) is a small city in San Mateo County, California, located on the lower slopes of the San Bruno Mountain. The city is on the northeastern edge of San Mateo County, located immediately south of the San Francisco city limits on the San Francisco Bay. The population was 4,851 as of the 2020 census.

Brisbane is called &quot;The City of Stars&quot; because of a holiday tradition dating back to 1939. At the start of the Christmas/Hanukkah season, many residents and business owners place large, illuminated stars, some as big as or more in diameter, on the downhill sides of homes and offices throughout Brisbane. Many of the stars are kept up all year.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (84.58%) is water, the latter the Brisbane Lagoon. A remnant of San Francisco Bay, the lagoon was formed by the construction of the U.S. Highway 101 causeway, and became diminished as most of its north and central portions were filled with landfill. Brisbane sits at the southeast corner of the Guadalupe Valley.

Guadalupe Valley Creek is a small creek which flows east through Brisbane along the north flank of San Bruno Mountain and enters the Brisbane Lagoon after passing under the Tunnel Avenue bridge.

==History==

The first recorded inhabitants were the Costanoan Indians. They built dome-shaped dwellings of boughs and tules. By 1776, Spanish explorers had arrived and the Franciscan missionaries soon followed leaving numerous large land grants in their wake. With Mexican rule, the lands controlled by the Mission were released to private enterprise.

Brisbane was originally part of Rancho Cañada de Guadalupe la Visitación y Rodeo Viejo, a large tract of land that included the Cañada de Guadalupe (now Guadalupe Valley), and also the Bayshore district of Daly City, the Visitacion Valley district of San Francisco, and San Bruno Mountain. Visitacion City, as it was initially known, was platted in 1908 adjacent to a new rail line that had been completed in 1907 to the east of the town site. The Southern Pacific Railroad built the new line to create a faster and more direct route into San Francisco. The railroad also planned to build extensive terminal facilities just north of the town site. The Visitacion Valley rail yard and locomotive works were expected to employ over 1,000 workers, but construction was halted soon after it began due to the Panic of 1907. The town site remained largely undeveloped for many years. The railroad resumed construction of the yard and shops during World War I, and the facilities were completed by 1918.

The city is served by San Mateo County Libraries.

In the 1920s Arthur Annis proposed the name change from Visitacion City to Brisbane. Annis regarded the name Visitacion City as a handicap &quot;being so close to a San Francisco city district with a similar name&quot;, which he felt would confuse people and prevent &quot;Brisbane&quot; from establishing its own unique identity. Accounts of how the city acquired its name vary. According to his daughter, the city was named for Brisbane, Queensland, perhaps due to the area&#x27;s resemblance to that port city at the time. Another story holds that it was named for newspaper columnist Arthur Brisbane.

Brisbane&#x27;s economy is dominated by office parks at Sierra Point and an industrial park around the Valley Drive corridor. There are commercial areas at Brisbane Village, Visitacion Avenue, and Bayshore Avenue. The population of Brisbane doubles during the work day as such facilities fill up with commuters. Some of the larger office tenants in Brisbane are Cutera Inc., Dolby, Tercica, Sing Tao, and Intermune. Monster Cable Products and bebe stores (traditionally spelled in lowercase) are headquartered in Brisbane on Valley Drive. The Sierra Point office park area is home to a number of well-known class A office buildings like the Dakin Building.

Universal Paragon&#x27;s proposed Brisbane Baylands project, if approved by Brisbane voters, proposes to more than double the existing employment base of the city by providing new office, research &amp; development, retail, hotel and other land uses that are accessible by a proposed multi-modal transit station (Caltrain, Muni T-Third light rail and proposed Bus Rapid Transit). Houses are quite expensive, as the average home cost is around $639,000. This compared to the California average of $393,000 follows a common home price trend in the surrounding areas.

==History==
The farms that had long graced the area started to give way to suburban housing developments from the 1940s onwards. The residents of Broadmoor, rallying around their police protection district and their sense of identity as a separate community, have been mostly successful in fighting off annexation by Daly City, despite losing slices of their community&#x27;s territory, including its police headquarters, in the many piecemeal annexations which over the years saw Daly City gradually encircle Broadmoor in its entirety. Daly City&#x27;s attempts to annex the enclave and Broadmoor residents&#x27; resistance to those efforts have led to strained relations between the two entities at times.

==Public safety==
A special property tax assessment funds the Broadmoor Police Department, which was founded in 1948 after residents grew concerned of long response times from the San Mateo County Sheriff&#x27;s Department—most of whose deputies are based in the southern end of the county. The Broadmoor Police Protection District is governed by a Police Commission, the Broadmoor Police Protection District Board of Police Commissioners, which consists of three residents elected at large every four years. In 2007 State Senator Leland Yee (California&#x27;s Eighth District) authored legislation sponsored by the Broadmoor Police Department to recognize Broadmoor as a municipal or city police department. Senate Bill 230, which was signed by Governor Schwarzenegger, provides Broadmoor Police with the same legal recognition and status of a city or municipal police department. The Broadmoor Police Department is staffed by eight full-time police officers, including the chief of police, and twenty-five part-time police officers.

As of 2021, an investigation of retirement fraud and misuse of public funds by former top employees of the District is ongoing.
The former police chief, Michael Connolly, was sentenced to probation for conflict-of-interest charges.

Fire protection is provided by the Colma Fire Protection District. The Colma Fire Protection District also provides 24 hr paramedic (ALS) coverage 365 days a year. It is staffed with one paramedic at all times.

<text>Burlingame () is a city in San Mateo County, California, United States. It is located on the San Francisco Peninsula and has a significant shoreline on San Francisco Bay. The city is named after diplomat Anson Burlingame and is known for its numerous eucalyptus groves, walkable downtown area, and public school system. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 31,386.

==History==

Burlingame is situated on land previously owned by San Francisco-based merchant William Davis Merry Howard. Howard planted many eucalyptus trees on his property and retired to live on the land. Howard died in 1856 and the land was sold to William C. Ralston, a prominent banker. In 1868, Ralston named the land after his friend Anson Burlingame, the United States Ambassador to China. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, hundreds of lots in Burlingame were sold to people looking to establish new homes, and the town of Burlingame was incorporated in 1908. In 1910, the neighboring town of Easton was annexed and this area is now known as the Easton Addition neighborhood of Burlingame.

Burlingame refers to itself as the City of Trees due to its over 18,000 public trees within the city. In 1908, the Burlingame board of trustees passed an ordinance &quot;prohibiting cutting, injuring, or destroying trees&quot;. The city also has many parks and eucalyptus groves.

In 2018, upon the 150th anniversary of the 1868 landmark Burlingame Treaty between the U.S. and China, a new bust of diplomat Anson Burlingame, sculpted by Zhou Limin from China, was unveiled at an international ceremony at the Burlingame Public Library.

<text>Colma (Ohlone for &quot;Springs&quot;) is a small incorporated town in San Mateo County, California, United States, on the San Francisco Peninsula in the San Francisco Bay Area. The population was 1,507 at the 2020 census. The town was founded as a necropolis in 1924.

With most of Colma&#x27;s land dedicated to cemeteries, the population of the dead—not specifically known but speculated to be around 1.5 million—outnumbers that of the living by a ratio of nearly a thousand to one. This has led to Colma being called &quot;the City of the Silent&quot; and has given rise to a humorous motto, formerly featured on the city&#x27;s website: &quot;It&#x27;s great to be alive in Colma&quot;.

==Etymology==
The most commonly proposed origin of the name &quot;Colma&quot; is the Ohlone word mean &quot;springs&quot; or &quot;many springs&quot;.

There are several other proposed origins of Colma. Erwin Gudde&#x27;s California Place Names states seven possible sources of the town&#x27;s being called Colma: William T. Coleman (a local landowner), Thomas Coleman (a local resident), misspelling of Colmar in France, misspelling of Colima in Mexico, a re-spelling of an ancient Uralic word meaning death, a reference to James Macpherson&#x27;s &quot;Songs of Selma&quot;, and two Ohlone possibilities, one meaning &quot;moon&quot; and one meaning &quot;springs&quot;.

Before 1872, Colma was designated as &quot;Station&quot; or &quot;School House Station&quot;, the name of its post office in 1869.

==History==
The community of Colma was formed in the 19th century as a collection of homes and small businesses along El Camino Real and the adjacent San Francisco and San Jose Railroad line. Several churches, including Holy Angels Catholic Church, were founded in these early years. The community founded its own fire district, which serves the unincorporated area of Colma north of the town limits, as well as the area that became a town in 1924.

Heinrich (Henry) von Kempf moved his wholesale nursery here in the early part of the 20th century, from the land where the Palace of Fine Arts currently sits. The business was growing, and thus required more space for von Kempf&#x27;s plants and trees. Von Kempf then began petitioning to turn the Colma community into an agricultural township. He succeeded and became the town of Colma&#x27;s first treasurer.

In the early 20th century, Colma was the site of many major boxing events. Middleweight world champion Stanley Ketchel fought six bouts at the Mission Street Arena in Colma, including two world middleweight title bouts against Billy Papke and a world heavyweight title bout against Jack Johnson.

===San Francisco cemetery relocations===

Colma became the site for numerous cemeteries after San Francisco outlawed new interments within its city limits in 1900, then evicted most existing cemeteries in 1912. In the 1910s, many of the roads to Colma were not maintained. Bodies were transported by street cars in San Francisco down Valencia Street in the Mission District; which resulted in many mortuaries and funeral homes in this location for quick access to Colma. Approximately 150,000 bodies were moved between 1920 and 1941, at a cost of $10 per grave and marker. Many of the remains in Colma came from the Lone Mountain Cemetery complex. Those for whom no one paid the fee were reburied in mass graves, and the markers were recycled in various San Francisco public works. Some examples include drain gutters at Buena Vista Park and bolstering breakwater near the St. Francis Yacht Club. They can be seen at low tide on Ocean Beach. The completion of the relocation was delayed until after World War II. The main rail line between San Francisco and San Jose running through Colma had been bypassed by the Bayshore Cutoff, completed in 1907 and providing a route closer to the San Francisco Bay shoreline, and the former main line was repurposed as a branch line to move coffins to Colma. Decades later, the right-of-way for the branch line through Colma was purchased by BART for use in the San Francisco International Airport extension project.

An early effort to incorporate in 1903 was condemned by the &quot;San Francisco Call&quot; as &quot;a scheme whereby the town of Colma is to be made a plague spot of vice&quot; to benefit gamblers and crooked politicians. The Town of Lawndale was incorporated in 1924, primarily at the behest of the cemetery owners with the cooperation of the handful of residents who lived closest to the cemeteries. The residential and business areas immediately to the north continued to be known as Colma. As another California city named Lawndale already existed, in Los Angeles County, the post office retained the Colma designation, and the town changed its name back to Colma in 1941.

==Businesses==
Originally, Colma&#x27;s residents were primarily employed in occupations related to the many cemeteries in the town. Since the 1980s, however, Colma has become more diversified, and a variety of retail businesses and automobile dealerships has brought more sales tax revenue to the town government. In 1986, 280 Metro Center opened for business in Colma; it is now recognized as the world&#x27;s first power center.

==Geography and geology==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land. The town&#x27;s 17 cemeteries comprise approximately 73% of the town&#x27;s land area. It borders Daly City (to the north and west, separated by Junipero Serra Boulevard), South San Francisco (to the south, separated by Arlington, Mission, and Lawndale), and San Bruno Mountain State Park (to the east).

Colma is situated on the San Francisco Peninsula at the highest point of the Merced Valley, a gap between San Bruno Mountain and the northernmost foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountain Range. The foothills and eastern flanks of the range are composed largely of poorly consolidated Pliocene-Quaternary freshwater and shallow marine sediments that include the Colma and Merced Formations, recent slope wash, ravine fill, colluvium, and alluvium. These surficial deposits unconformably overlay the much older Jurassic to Cretaceous-aged Franciscan Assemblage. The Junipero Serra Landfill, which closed in 1983 and extended approximately deep, was developed and reopened as the mixed-use Metro Center.

Colma Creek flows through the city as it makes its way from San Bruno Mountain to San Francisco Bay.

==Transportation==
BART has two stations serving Colma: Colma, at the northern border near Daly City, and South San Francisco, just across the southern border. In addition, SamTrans buses serve the city with public transportation.

There are three primary north-south roads for automobile and truck traffic through Colma; from west to east, they are Junipero Serra Boulevard, El Camino Real, and Hillside Boulevard. They are connected approximately through the center of Colma by Serramonte Boulevard.

<text>Daly City () is the second-most populous city in San Mateo County, California, United States. Located in the San Francisco Bay Area, and immediately south of San Francisco (sharing its northern border with almost all of San Francisco&#x27;s southern border), it is named for businessman and landowner John Donald Daly. Its population was 104,901 at the 2020 census. The racial makeup of Daly City was 57.3% Asian, 11.7% non-Hispanic White, and 23.1% Hispanic or Latino of any race in the 2020 census. Notably, 33.2% of the population of Daly City is Filipino.

==History==

Archaeological evidence suggests the San Francisco Bay area has been inhabited as early as 2700 BC. People of the Ohlone language group probably occupied Northern California from at least the year A.D. 500. Though their territory had been claimed by Spain since the early 16th century, they had relatively little contact with Europeans until 1769, when as part of an effort to colonize Alta California, an exploration party led by Don Gaspar de Portolá learned of the existence of San Francisco Bay. Seven years later, in 1776, an expedition led by Juan Bautista de Anza selected the site for the Presidio of San Francisco, which José Joaquín Moraga soon established. Later the same year, Franciscan missionary Francisco Palóu founded the Mission San Francisco de Asís (Mission Dolores). As part of the founding, the priests claimed the land south of the mission for 16 miles for raising crops and for fodder for cattle and sheep. In 1778, the priests and soldiers marked out a trail to connect San Francisco to the rest of California. At the top of Mission Hill, the priests named the gap between San Bruno Mountain and the hills on the coast &quot;La Portezuela&quot; (&quot;the Little Door&quot;). La Portezuela was later referred to as Daly&#x27;s Hill, the Center of Daly City, and is now called Top of the Hill.

During Spanish rule, the area between San Bruno Mountain and the Pacific remained uninhabited. Upon independence from Spain, prominent Mexican citizens were granted land parcels to establish large ranches, three of which covered areas now in Daly City and Colma. Rancho Buri Buri was granted to Jose Sanchez in 1835 and covered , including parts of modern-day Colma, Burlingame, San Bruno, South San Francisco, and Millbrae. Rancho Laguna de la Merced was acres and covered the area around a lake of the same name. The third ranch covering parts of the Daly City–Colma area was named Rancho Cañada de Guadalupe la Visitación y Rodeo Viejo and stretched from the Visitacion Valley area in San Francisco, to the city of South San Francisco covering .

Following the Mexican Cession of California at the end of the Mexican–American War, the owners of Rancho Laguna de la Merced tried to claim land between San Bruno Mountain and Lake Merced. An 1853 US government survey declared that the contested area was, in fact, government property and could be acquired by private citizens. A brief land rush occurred as settlers, mainly Irish, established ranches and farms in parts of what is now the neighborhoods of Westlake, Serramonte, and the cities of Colma and Pacifica. A decade later, several families left as increases in the fog density killed grain and potato crops. The few remaining families switched to dairy and cattle farming as a more profitable enterprise. In the late 19th century as San Francisco grew and San Mateo County was established, Daly City also gradually grew, including homes and schools along the lines for the Southern Pacific railroad. Daly City served as a location where San Franciscans would cross over county lines to gamble and fight. As tensions built in approach to the American Civil War, California was divided between pro-slavery, and Free Soil advocates. Two of the main figures in the debate were US Senator David C. Broderick, a Free Soil advocate, and David S. Terry, who was in favor of extension of slavery into California. Quarreling and political fighting between the two eventually led to a duel in the Lake Merced area, at which Terry mortally wounded Broderick, who died three days later. The site of the duel is marked with two granite shafts where the men stood, and is designated as California Historical Landmark number 19.

===20th century===

On the morning of April 18, 1906, a major earthquake struck just off the coast of Daly City near Mussel Rock. After the quake and subsequent fire destroyed many San Franciscans&#x27; homes, they left for temporary housing on the ranches of the area to the south, including the large one owned by John Daly. Daly had come to the Bay Area in 1853, where he had worked on a dairy farm, and after several years, married his bosses&#x27; daughter and acquired at the Top of the Hill area. Over the years, Daly&#x27;s business grew, as did his political clout. When a flood of refugees from the quake came, Daly and other local farmers donated milk and other food items. Daly later subdivided his property, from which several housing tracts emerged.

As some of the refugees established homes in the area, the need for city services grew. This, combined with the fear of annexation by San Francisco and being ignored by San Mateo County, whose seat far to the south left residents feeling ignored, created a demand for incorporation. The first such attempt was proposed in 1908 for incorporation as the city of Vista Grande. Vista Grande would have spanned from the Pacific to the Bay, with San Francisco as its northern border and South San Francisco and the old Rancho Buri Buri as its southern border. The proposal was rejected over the scope of the planned city, which was too broad for many residents. The initial proposal also revealed rifts in the community among the various regions, including the area around the cemeteries, which were excluded from further plans of incorporation. On January 16, 1911, an incorporation committee filed a petition with San Mateo County supervisors to incorporate the City of Daly City, which would run from San Francisco along the San Bruno Hills until Price and School Streets with San Francisco and west to the summit of the San Bruno Hills. The city would have an estimated population of 2,900. On March 18, 1911, a special election was held, with incorporation narrowly succeeding by a vote of 132 to 130.

It remained a relatively small community until the late 1940s, when developer Henry Doelger established Westlake, a major district of homes and businesses, including the Westlake Shopping Center. Beginning in the 1950s, Filipino Americans began to purchase homes east of Junipero Serra Boulevard, as they were barred from the Westlake development due to racial covenants. On March 22, 1957, Daly City was again the epicenter of an earthquake, this one a 5.3-magnitude quake on the San Andreas Fault, which caused some structural damage in Westlake and closed State Route 1 along the Westlake Palisades. In 1963, Daly City annexed the city of Bayshore. The Cow Palace, located in Bayshore and now within the city limits of Daly City, was the site of the following year&#x27;s Republican National Convention; it had also hosted the 1956 RNC. The Daly City BART station opened on September 11, 1972, providing northern San Mateo County with rail service to downtown San Francisco and other parts of the Bay Area. The line was extended south to Colma in 1996 and then to Millbrae and the San Francisco International Airport in 2003.

In October 1984, Taiwanese American writer Henry Liu was assassinated in his garage in Daly City, allegedly by Kuomintang agents.

The Daly City History Museum, opened in March 2009, is located in the building that housed the John Daly Library, Daly City&#x27;s first library. The museum houses exhibits related to Daly City&#x27;s history, and maintains an archive of photos and documents.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Daly City is bordered by the cities of San Francisco, Brisbane, Pacifica, South San Francisco, and the town of Colma. The city borders several unincorporated areas of San Mateo County. It surrounds Broadmoor, and borders San Bruno Mountain State Park, the Olympic Club, Lake Merced, and unincorporated areas near Colma. Seismic faults in and near Daly City include the San Andreas Fault, Hillside Fault, and Serra Fault.

===Neighborhoods===

Neighborhoods of Daly City include Westlake, St. Francis Heights, Serramonte, Top of the Hill, Hillside, Crocker, Southern Hills, and Bayshore. Westlake is notable for its distinct architecture and for being among the earliest examples of a planned, large-tract suburb. It was the inspiration for Malvina Reynolds&#x27; 1962 song &quot;Little Boxes&quot;, and later a coffee-table book and documentary &quot;Little Boxes: The Architecture of a Classic Midcentury Suburb&quot;. Bayshore, the easternmost neighborhood of Daly City, was an incorporated city, Bayshore City, from 1932 to 1940; it was annexed to Daly City in 1963. Several Daly City neighborhoods, such as Crocker, Southern Hills, and Bayshore, share a street grid and similar characteristics with adjacent San Francisco neighborhoods, such as Crocker-Amazon and Visitacion Valley.

Several neighborhoods associated with Daly City lie outside of its city limits. Broadmoor is an unincorporated area completely surrounded by Daly City. Colma is an incorporated town sandwiched between Daly City, South San Francisco, and San Bruno Mountain. These enclaves are in charge of their own police and fire services, but also share some services with Daly City.

===Climate===
Daly City&#x27;s climate is similar to that of San Francisco&#x27;s western areas such as the Richmond District and Sunset District areas, with fog occurring in the spring and early-to-late summer. Julys and Augusts, on rare occasions, peak over 75°F. Summers are cool and dry, whereas winters are mild and wet.

The Cow Palace arena grounds straddle the border with San Francisco and is the home for the annual Grand National Rodeo, Horse, and Stock Show. It has hosted events such as concerts by the Beatles, the now-Golden State Warriors and their early appearances in the NBA Finals, the NHL San Jose Sharks hockey team, two short-lived minor-league hockey teams (the IHL San Francisco Spiders and ECHL San Francisco Bulls), and two Republican National Conventions (in 1956 and 1964).

Century 20 Daly City is a modern megaplex movie theatre opened in 2002 as part of the Pacific Plaza business and retail development.

Several golf courses are located within or straddle the border with San Francisco.

The private San Francisco Golf Club and Lake Merced Golf Club have part or all of their courses in Daly City. The Golden Gate National Recreation Area includes the city&#x27;s Thornton Beach. The topography of this area (due to the San Andreas Fault) is conducive to paragliding and hang gliding.

Daly City and neighboring Colma have emerged as shopping meccas for San Francisco residents. A combination of plentiful free parking space (compared to the constrained and expensive parking options in San Francisco) and San Mateo County&#x27;s historically slightly lower state sales tax rate have contributed to this trend. Many big box retailers that are unable to operate in San Francisco due to real-estate prices, space restrictions, or political or community opposition have opened stores in the Serramonte and Westlake neighborhoods. Daly City&#x27;s shopping centers are Serramonte Center and Westlake Shopping Center.

Daly City is a major hub for public transit. Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) serves Daly City at a namesake station, as well as at Colma Station, which abuts the Daly City limits). In the 1980s, planning was conducted for the BART extension south from San Francisco, the first step being the Daly City Tailtrack Project, upon which turnaround project the San Francisco Airport Extension later built. Daly City station is the terminus of BART&#x27;s Green and Blue lines, and the furthermost point in the BART network where every destination in the system can be reached without a transfer during normal hours.

In addition to BART, Daly City station serves as the northern terminus of SamTrans&#x27; ECR route and southern terminus of Muni&#x27;s 14 Mission Rapid.

<text>East Palo Alto ( ; abbreviated E.P.A.) is a city in San Mateo County, California, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of East Palo Alto was 30,034. It is situated on the San Francisco Peninsula, roughly halfway between the cities of San Francisco and San Jose. To the north and east is the San Francisco Bay, to the west is the city of Menlo Park, and to the south the city of Palo Alto. East Palo Alto was founded as an unincorporated community and was incorporated in July 1983. The two cities are separated only by San Francisquito Creek and, largely, the Bayshore Freeway (the vast majority of East Palo Alto is northeast of the freeway, while all of the residential part of Palo Alto is southwest of the freeway). The revitalization projects in 2000, and high income high-tech professionals moving into new developments, including employees from Google and Facebook, have begun to slowly eliminate the historically wide cultural and economic differences between the two cities. East Palo Alto and Palo Alto share both telephone area codes and postal ZIP codes.

In 1990, 43% of East Palo Alto&#x27;s residents were African Americans, which was the result of redlining practices and racial deed restrictions in Palo Alto, while 34% were Latinos. As of 2020, African Americans were 11%, while Latinos are about 66%. A small minority of Pacific Islanders also reside in East Palo Alto, most of Tongan, Samoan, and Fijian origin.

The prosperity that benefited Silicon Valley during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s largely bypassed East Palo Alto. The Ravenswood City School District, which serves East Palo Alto and part of adjoining Menlo Park, has struggled with low academic performance. Eventually, however, the Peninsula&#x27;s shortage of land and soaring property prices meant that East Palo Alto became an option for urban regeneration.

East Palo Alto includes a small piece of land southwest of the Bayshore Freeway (U.S. Route 101), across the freeway from the Gateway 101 shopping center. This land is roughly triangular and sits between the freeway and San Francisquito Creek. This land was formerly the site of a two-block-long retail business district known as Whiskey Gulch. Since 1888, Stanford University, on the west side of Palo Alto, prohibited alcohol sales within a radius of from the campus. Whiskey Gulch, which was just outside these limits, became home to a number of liquor stores, bars, and music venues. The rules were relaxed in 1970, but the neighborhood still retained this character until 2000, when the city tore down Whiskey Gulch and replaced it with the University Circle office complex. A 200-room Four Seasons hotel opened in University Circle in 2006.

Over 25% of East Palo Alto (400+ acres) has been bulldozed and replaced with brand new housing and brand-name retail establishments since approximately 1997, attracting an entirely new demographic. The University Square community has become particularly appealing to young high-tech professionals and high-income couples, including many employees from Google, Facebook, Sun Microsystems, Yahoo!, and various other software and startup companies.

==History==

The Ohlone tribe of Native Americans inhabited this area at least by 1500 to 1000 BC. One tumulus was discovered in 1951 during development of the University Village subdivision near today&#x27;s Costaño School. After a year-long excavation of 60 graves and 3,000 artifacts, researchers concluded Native Americans had utilized the area as a cemetery and camp, rather than as a permanent settlement. In later years another mound was found near Willow Road and the railroad right-of-way.
From the 1850s through the 1940s, the area which was to become East Palo Alto went through many changes. In 1849, Isaiah Churchill Woods (1825–1880) attempted to make the area around what is now &quot;Cooley Landing&quot; in the northeast of the current city a major shipping town and named the area &quot;Ravenswood&quot;. In 1868, after Woods&#x27; investments failed he sold the wharf to Lester Phillip Cooley (1837–1882), who leased the land to the brick factory &quot;Hunter and Schakleford&quot;. When the brick factory left the landing in 1884, the land around the landing was reverted to a ranch.

With the outbreak of World War I, the north side of East Palo Alto became a military training ground, of which only the Veterans Administration Hospital in Menlo Park still exists (now as part of the VA Sierra Pacific Network). In the 1940s, East Palo Alto was a farming community with many Japanese residents. During the war, the Japanese were forced out, many to relocation centers, and did not return after the war.

In the 1950s the farms were built over with cheap housing and many African-American families moved in, the result of redlining housing policies. In particular, in 1954 the then-president of the California Real Estate Association, Floyd Lowe, implemented a strategy that turned a neighborhood on the East side of Palo Alto from predominantly white to predominantly black in a very short amount of time. He did this by &quot;blockbusting,&quot; which is a strategy that was employed all over the country to similar results. Blockbusting involves instilling panic in white neighborhoods by warning of a &quot;Negro invasion&quot; when a black family considers purchasing a house in an area, in order to produce white flight and an ensuing drop in property values, which can then be purchased at a heavy discount and sold or rented to African Americans for a profit. In 1954, Lowe alerted the neighborhood that a &quot;Negro invasion&quot; was imminent, and as intended, white flight ensued. Lowe profited due to the low prices at which the white families fleeing were willing to sell their homes, and within a few years, the demographics of the area had flipped. As white-owned businesses fled the area, it became poorer and overcrowded – a legacy that has persisted. This segregationist act was never questioned by the government, and it led to many of the demographic and socioeconomic differences that exist between Palo Alto and East Palo Alto today.

These differences in demographics and wealth perversely accelerated with the introduction of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which banned redlining. Home prices doubled by 1979, and many of the more educated and upwardly mobile African Americans took advantage of their newfound freedom to move into wealthier communities with more amenities, leaving the remaining community even poorer and with less access to home ownership than had been the case before the Act.

During the civil rights movement of the 1960s there was a renewed interest in African history, one expression of which was a fad for Swahili. In 1968 the area was almost renamed Nairobi, after the center of the Swahili-speaking area, to reflect the population&#x27;s African roots. Critics of the change pointed out that Nairobi was the capital of Kenya, in East Africa, and had little to do with the cultural roots of most black Americans. In the end, the change was not made.
Historically East Palo Alto had relatively little shopping and business compared to surrounding areas, and most of it constituted an unincorporated &quot;island&quot; within San Mateo County, depending on county government for services and on the San Mateo County Sheriff for police protection and ineligible for many revenue benefits requiring city status. After several years of pro-incorporation campaigning by local community groups, including Barbara A. Mouton and East Palo Alto&#x27;s Senior Citizen Center president Ruth I. Myers, 1982 ballot measure that was stopped by a lawsuit, and a subsequent election the next year, East Palo Alto became a city on July 1, 1983, with Barbara A. Mouton as its first Mayor. However, because of subsequent legal challenges to the last ballot measure, it was not until 1987 that the city was officially recognized as such. The legal challenges were led by former U.S. Congress member Pete McCloskey, who represented one of the real-estate brokers whose original blockbusting campaign had turned EPA into a mostly black town. The final tally was 1,777 for and 1,764 against, a margin of 13 votes and a majority of 50.2%.

In the 1980s, large numbers of Hispanics moved into East Palo Alto and by 1990, the city had lost its Black majority population which declined from 60 percent in 1980 to 41.5 percent in 1990 while the Hispanic population increased from 14 percent to 36 percent.

Significant gentrification occurred in East Palo Alto from around the founding of Facebook, with the construction of a large shopping center named Ravenswood 101 and several upscale housing communities intended for high-earning Silicon Valley workers. This development faced opposition from some residents, who charged that it priced locals out of one of the region&#x27;s only affordable communities while providing only low-paying retail jobs and consuming disproportionate land area (2.2 square miles). Supporters pointed to an increased tax base.

In 2008, after twenty years without a supermarket, East Palo Alto individuals and organizations established the East Palo Alto Community Farmers&#x27; Market. In November 2009, the Mi Pueblo Food Center grocery store opened in the Ravenswood 101 shopping center in the location of the former Circuit City store. Mi Pueblo was the city&#x27;s first full-service supermarket in 23 years.

Starting in 2006, a large real estate investor, Page Mill Properties, purchased almost the entire west side of East Palo Alto and contested most of the city&#x27;s rent control laws in what some claimed was a &#x27;predatory equity scheme&#x27;. Page Mill left East Palo Alto in the fall of 2009 after defaulting on a $240-million bank loan.

In 1992, the city had the country&#x27;s highest per-capita murder rate, with 42 murders for 25,000 residents. In 2023, the city had no murders, the first time in its history.

Burnham&#x27;s other works included overseeing the design for the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago and designing the 1902 Flatiron Building in New York City. Burnham&#x27;s plan was commissioned by the Ocean Shore Railroad, which developed El Granada as a seaside resort for visitors who would use the railroad to travel between San Francisco and El Granada. The city was originally named &quot;Granada&quot; after the city in Spain but the Post Office mistakenly recorded the name as &quot;El Granada&quot; in 1909. Financial difficulties and the advent of the automobile caused the railroad to abandon the plan, and El Granada subsequently became a residential community.

<doc id="108109" wikidata="Q2042944" url="?curid=108109" title="Emerald Lake Hills, California">
<text>Emerald Lake Hills or Emerald Hills is a census-designated place and neighborhood in unincorporated San Mateo County, in the state of California, United States. Situated among oak-studded hills between Woodside, Redwood City, and San Carlos roughly bounded by Edgewood Road, Alameda de las Pulgas, Farm Hill Boulevard, and Interstate 280. The population was 4,406 at the 2020 census and the per-capita income was $68,966, making it the 22nd wealthiest place in California and the 82nd highest income places in the United States

Emerald Lake Hills was originally conceived as a resort community for city-weary San Franciscans during World War I. Emerald Lake Hills actually consists of two large subdivisions created around 1920: Emerald Lake (even though there are two lakes) and Emerald Hills. Residents refer to the area by either Emerald Hills or by Emerald Lake Hills. The name Emerald Hills is now more commonly adopted due to mailing designation rules, as the U.S. Post Office would allow only a two-word name.

According to an interview with Yuji Naka, Emerald Hills is the namesake for the famous Emerald Hill Zone, the first level of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;.

==Points of interest==
Edgewood County Park and Natural Preserve
Renowned throughout the San Francisco Bay Area for its spectacular display of spring wildflowers, Edgewood Park occupies of grasslands, chaparral, and wooded foothills between Highway 280 and the homes of Emerald Hills. Known for its biotic diversity, this small wilderness was declared a permanent natural preserve in 1993 with support from the EHHA, thus protecting it from any future development. The park has four entrances: Old Stage Coach Road off Edgewood Road, the Sunset Trailhead off Hillcrest Way, Clarkia Way off Cañada Road, and the Sylvan Way Access. A well-maintained system of trails is open for hikers, joggers, and equestrians.

Emerald Lakes
Named for the distinctive emerald green water that fills them, the two lakes created by the original developers of Emerald Hills still exist to enhance the beauty of the area. While Upper Emerald Lake on Jefferson Avenue is privately held by the owners of its surrounding shoreline, Lower Emerald Lake is owned and operated by the Emerald Lake Country Club. Formed in 1920, the club is located at 500 Lake Boulevard on the intersection of Oak Knoll and Vista Drive. Club members and their families enjoy swimming, sunbathing, picnicking, and fishing in Lower Emerald Lake during the summer months.

Handley Rock Park
Located on Handley Trail Way in the center of Emerald Hills, Handley Rock Park features a monolith of sandstone of , the largest formation of its kind in San Mateo County Situated on a lot of , this County-approved private park is operated by the Handley Rock Association, a group of local residents and rock-climbing enthusiasts.

==Early history==
Emerald Lake Hills is located in what was once the Rancho de las Pulgas (&quot;Flea Ranch&quot;). This land was granted in 1795 to José Darío Argüello, one of the last governors of Spanish California. The land was later passed on to his son, Luis Antonio Argüello, who in 1822 became California&#x27;s first native, elected governor. Luis Argüello died in 1830, probably never having lived on the Rancho. In 1835, the Mexican government officially granted land ownership rights to his heirs.

Luis Argüello&#x27;s widow, Soledad Ortega, did move to the ranch; her home was near what is now Argüello Park in San Carlos. Some accounts say she moved to the ranch right after his death; others say it was in the 1840s, during the Mexican War, when U.S. troops were occupying California.

==Early statehood==
In the early 1850s, Mexico having ceded California and gold having been discovered, there was a huge rush for land. Squatters began occupying the Argüello rancho amid rumors that the family&#x27;s title to the ranch was no good. The Argüellos hired lawyer Simon Mezes to defend their claim. His payment was 15 percent of their land, a prime bayfront parcel. Mezesville later became Redwood City, port for the logging industry.

Before Soledad Argüello died in 1874, the rancho would be further divided. By the mid-1850s, legislator Horace Hawes had a big parcel between Whipple and Woodside roads, with a house on the site of Sequoia High School. Hawes used a former stock pond on the ranch for irrigation—the pond that would become Lower Emerald Lake. By 1885 the northern part of Hawes&#x27; estate had been bought by Moses Hopkins (brother of Mark Hopkins), who dammed the pond to increase its capacity. An existing rock wall at Rose Gate, a home on Lakeview Way above the lake, is said to be a boundary wall of the Argüello ranch, suggesting that the western sections of the original parcel remained intact toward the around the start of the 20th century.

==Roaring &#x27;20s resort==
In the early 1920s, San Francisco developers had an eye on the area as a site for recreational summer homes. The name Emerald Hills was first used in a 1920 brochure distributed by George Irvine, who had big plans but inadequate cash . When he lost the property near the lake, it was purchased by Charles Holt, the Anglo-California Bank employee assigned to the foreclosure. Holt brought in builder George Leonard, and Emerald Lake Hills became the prime property of the Leonard &amp; Holt Real Estate &amp; Mortgage Co. (Another of their projects was Ingleside Terraces, on Junipero Serra Boulevard and Ocean Avenue in San Francisco.) Early on in the development, Irvine&#x27;s original sewer system became overtaxed and the dam burst; Leonard and Holt had to drain the lake and rebuild the dam.

The developers aimed their marketing at San Francisco families, emphasizing the proximity of Emerald Lake Hills as a weekend or vacation retreat and especially singing the praises of its largely fog-free climate. They cited the &quot;climate best by government test&quot; and compared it to &quot;the eternal summer which Lord Byron ascribed to Greece.&quot; A Leonard &amp; Holt newsletter says the area &quot;rivals the beauty of fine old European towns,&quot; and predicts it will become a resort famous throughout California. The company would regularly bus potential buyers in for free picnics at the lakes. A golf course was built atop the hill to the north of the lake, with the clubhouse at 530 Lakeview Way.

In 1926, 20 land owners of lakeside homes banded together and bought the lake to increase the value of their properties. They established their consortium as the Emerald Lake Country Club, and their grant deed forbid the construction of &quot;any barroom, livery stable, hospital or undertakertaking establishment&quot;. One of the early members of the Country Club was famous San Francisco attorney Vince Hallinan, who led the campaign against a swim dress code, citing the chic European women he&#x27;d seen in modern swimwear.

With the lake out of their hands, Leonard and Holt decided to build another, Emerald Lake No. 2 or Upper Emerald Lake. It was to be the centerpiece of the 3,000-resident community the Highlands of Emerald Lake. By summer 1927 they had built the lake by damming a creek and had created a beach, water slide, diving platforms and a playground with &quot;equipment of the most novel design.&quot; The lake&#x27;s clubhouse was what is now the residence at Lakeview and Edgecliff; (it was owned and restored by the Kenneth McBain family from 1964 until 2012); a structure at Lakeview and Jefferson is recalled as a roadhouse.

By 1927, of roads in the Emerald Lakes area had been completed, most of them paved. In 1929, the Easter Bowl, an outdoor amphitheater, was built at the crest of California Way, and a large concrete cross above it at the high point of the development. (The cross would later be vandalized and rebuilt larger—at , nearly as tall as the cross atop San Francisco&#x27;s Mount Davidson—which is just a bit taller at . Tony Gardenier related to the Tum Sudens along with the other family owners who had deep ties attempted to keep this cross lighted nightly, but the city council found it too expensive. The Tum Sudens, owned the upper property from Tum Suden Way, to their estate down the hill just east of Jefferson Ave. The hand prints of two of the boys Tony and Ricky who perished in swimming pool are pressed into the cement. From Jefferson Ave., across from the upper home on Tum Suden Way, are 2 stone columns hidden among the trees. The lower estate would eventually be sold to the Elks Club.

In the late 1920s, Leonard and Holt aggressively marketed Upper Emerald Lake to San Franciscans. However; the stock market crash hit both Emerald Lake developments hard. The golf course was sold and became the Wellbanks tract. The upper lake and an adjacent area of were sold in 1938 to Simpson Reinhard, a prominent jewelry store owner.

==After the war==
Within a few years of the end of World War II, Emerald Hills was making the transition from a vacation resort to a residential area, albeit a rustic one. The Emerald Lake Homeowners Association was established in the 1950s to contest the planned routing of an interstate highway through the neighborhood. (Completed in the early 1970s, Interstate 280 runs west of Emerald Hills, sticking close to the San Andreas Fault.) In the adjacent Farm Hill subdivision—part of Redwood City—kids discovered mercury in 1955 on the property of Andy Oddstad. The mercury market was not as vigorous, however, as it was in the years when the New Almaden Quicksilver Mine was a major industry in San Jose; the most visible result of the Farm Hill discovery today is a street named Silver Hill.

In 1968, Emerald Hills had 430 families, of which 110, about 25 percent, had resided there less than a year and 180 from one to nine years; four years later, the newcomer rate had dropped to 10 percent. Also near the lake was a convent occupied by Franciscan sisters from 1967–70; the order then built a large compound, Mount Alverno, adjacent to the Elks golf course. In 2008 it was sold to the Buddhist order Shinnyo-en, which currently uses it as their U.S. Head Temple.

A survey of homeowners at this time showed that, having staved off the interstate threat, they were most concerned with keeping the neighborhood&#x27;s rustic nature. On the whole, they opposed annexation to Redwood City, and supported bigger lot sizes for a maximum of 1,400 homes in the area, more trails, and preservation of the lakes and two unique features, the Easter Cross and Handley&#x27;s Rock. At the time, a large parcel adjacent to the proposed freeway at the community&#x27;s northern edge was being considered for a possible Cal State campus. That plan was abandoned, and, because the presence of a little butterfly called the bay checkerspot helped lead to the defeat of attempts to build a golf course there, the land is now Edgewood County Park.

==Maxing out==
Emerald Hills used septic tanks until the early 1980s, a factor that limited building: In 1982, the year the sewer system was installed, the neighborhood had 900 homes. A building moratorium from the late 1970s to 1986 forestalled the boom—but by 1992, the count had boomed to 1,400, eliminating most of the vacant lots. Many of the new homes were large and expensive. Among the new residents were several players of the San Francisco 49ers, including Joe Montana, as the team was then training in nearby Redwood City. Today, only a few lots remain open, and though building of homes continues, most of them are on the sites of former cabins and vacation homes.

==Resolved issues==
Annexation is no longer an issue.
Trails are limited to the parkland, though residents have been successful in limiting road width.

Upper Lake is owned by 11 households that border it. Lower Lake is owned by 50 families, and open to 105 more as summer club members.

The Easter Cross remains standing, visible to highway drivers as far south as Palo Alto. The Easter Bowl, however, was abandoned in the early 1980s, and the traditional services and animal parade are no longer held.

Handley&#x27;s Rock was bequeathed as public land by its owner, and has remained open to public despite neighboring residents&#x27; complaints of noise and fire danger.

<text>Foster City is a master-planned city located in San Mateo County, California, United States. Foster City is sometimes considered to be part of Silicon Valley for its local industry and its proximity to Silicon Valley cities.

==History==

Foster City was founded in the 1960s, built on the existing Brewer Island in the marshes of the San Francisco Bay on the east edge of San Mateo, enlarged with engineered landfill. The city was named after T. Jack Foster, a real estate magnate who owned much of the land comprising the city and who was instrumental in its initial design. His firm, Foster Enterprises, now run by his descendants, relocated to San Mateo in 2000 and is still active in real estate affairs throughout the San Francisco Bay Area.

The first residents moved into Foster City on March 7, 1964. Charles Zerbe, a San Francisco firefighter with a wife and two young sons, paid $23,500 for his five-bedroom house on Pilgrim Drive.

In the early 1960s, the first homes built in Foster City were sold for under $18,000. By the late 1960s, the average home price was just under $30,000.

<doc id="108111" wikidata="Q983652" url="?curid=108111" title="Half Moon Bay, California">
<text>Half Moon Bay is a coastal city in San Mateo County, California, United States, approximately south of San Francisco. Its population was 11,795 2020 census. Immediately north of Half Moon Bay is Pillar Point Harbor and the unincorporated community of Princeton-by-the-Sea. Half Moon Bay is known for Mavericks, a big-wave surf location. It is called Half Moon Bay because of its crescent shape.

Originally an agricultural outpost to Mission San Francisco de Asís, the town was founded in the 1840s first as San Benito, and then as its Anglo fishing community grew, it was renamed Spanishtown. In 1874, it was again renamed Half Moon Bay. After rail and road connections in the early 1900s, the town grew. The foggy weather of the coast made the town a popular destination for booze-running during Prohibition.

The city&#x27;s infrastructure is heavily integrated with the coast, including the Pillar Point Harbor, major roads, and the fire department. The economy of Half Moon Bay is dominated by a handful of businesses, the biggest of which is the Ritz-Carlton Half Moon Bay which employs 500 people and is a major source of property tax and tourism income for the city. Because of this geography, found that the city had over 123 buildings vulnerable to sea level rise.

==History==


Half Moon Bay began as a rural agricultural area, primarily used by Mission San Francisco de Asís (established in 1776) for grazing cattle, horses, and oxen. After the Mission&#x27;s secularization, Tiburcio Vásquez received the Rancho Corral de Tierra Mexican land grant in 1839 and Candelario Miramontes was granted Rancho Miramontes (later known as Rancho San Benito) in 1841.

The community began to develop in the 1840s as San Mateo County&#x27;s first real town. Originally, San Benito, the town was renamed Spanishtown and attracted a thriving fishing industry in addition to its continued importance to coastal agriculture. Spanishtown became a racially diverse community, settled by Canadians, Chinese, English, Germans, Irish, Mexicans, Italians, Scots, Portuguese, and Pacific Islanders. Regular stagecoach service was established with San Mateo; coaches also served Purissima, Lobitos, and San Gregorio. Levy Brothers opened a department store downtown. Spanishtown was officially renamed Half Moon Bay in 1874.

The area grew very slowly, even after the Ocean Shore Railroad began serving the community in 1907. The construction of Pedro Mountain Road in 1914 provided better access to San Francisco and probably contributed to the railroad&#x27;s demise by 1920. The USS &quot;DeLong&quot; ran aground at Half Moon Bay on December 1, 1921. During Prohibition &quot;rum runners&quot; took advantage of dense fog and hidden coves in the area to serve several roadhouses and inns, some of which operate today as restaurants (e.g., Moss Beach Distillery). Real growth in the area came after World War II with the construction of numerous subdivisions, eventually leading to Half Moon Bay&#x27;s incorporation in 1959. The city preserves a historic downtown district that has buildings dating as far back as 1869.

===2008 economic downturn and subsequent recovery===

In 2008, financial setbacks endangered the city&#x27;s viability. The economic crisis severely affected tourism, which generates the most revenue, and just when the city had finalized an $18million settlement over a property lawsuit. As the municipal budget was typically $14million or less, city fathers had issued bonds with annual payments of approximately $1 million over 25years. As a result of these obstacles, the threat of bankruptcy was very real. Dozens of meetings were held to decide where to cut the budget and finally, 75percent of municipal employees were laid off and replaced with contract workers. Employee contributions toward retirement benefits were also raised. The city council sought to regain the money paid in the settlement, believing that it should have been paid by the city&#x27;s insurers. A lawsuit against the insurers was decided in 2013 and the insurer was ordered to pay the city more than $13million; the Association of Bay Area Governments partially covered the costs of the lawsuit.

The city&#x27;s finances improved afterward. It was able to retire the first of its two 30-year Judgment Obligation Bonds (2009A Series Bonds) 20years early. The early retirement was expected to save the city over $426,000 in annual General Fund expenses starting in 201516.

As of the publication of the Fiscal Year 201516 Budget the General Fund budget was balanced and had a structural surplus of $4million.

===2023 mass shootings===
On January 23, 2023, mass shootings occurred in Half Moon Bay. A spree killer opened fire at two farms with a semi-automatic pistol, killing seven people and critically injuring an eighth person. A 66-year-old suspect was taken into custody after he arrived in his SUV at the parking lot of the sheriff&#x27;s office substation.

===2024 blocking of affordable housing===
In 2024, Half Moon Bay politicians were criticized by California Governor Gavin Newsom for repeatedly delaying approval of a 40-unit apartment building for senior farmworkers. Newsom threatened to take legal steps against the city if they continued stalling on the housing. Half Moon Bay Commissioner Rick Hernandez said that they were resistant to approving the senior farmworker housing because &quot;we love the character of our small-town community&quot; claiming that once this proposal is approved, it will trigger more requests for other constructions.

==Geography==


Half Moon Bay is approximately south of San Francisco, west of San Mateo, and north of Santa Cruz. Neighboring towns include El Granada, Princeton-by-the-Sea, Moss Beach, and Montara to the north and Purissima, San Gregorio, and Pescadero to the south.

Major local industries include agriculture (houseplants, floriculture, Christmas trees, pumpkins, artichokes), fishing, and tourism. Historically, Half Moon Bay had been known as San Benito and Spanishtown. A 2022 study of the effects of sea level rise, found that both major tourism attractions, and other infrastructure would be under threat from projected Sea level rise caused by global warming. The study found at least 123 buildings, including the Ritz Carlton (a major employer for the town), Pigeon Point Lighthouse and the Pescadero Cal Fire Station would be seriously threatened by erosion if sea level were to rise by .

A popular spot at Half Moon Bay is the &#x27;Jetty,&#x27; or as it is sometimes called, &#x27;The Breakwater.&#x27; This is a man-made break with unusual waves shaped by reflections from the breakwater at Pillar Point Harbor. Creeks in Half Moon Bay include Frenchmans, Pilarcitos and Naples.

Montara State Marine Reserve &amp; Pillar Point State Marine Conservation Area extend offshore from Montara, just north of Half Moon Bay. Like underwater parks, these marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.

<text>Hillsborough is an incorporated town in San Mateo County, California, United States, in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is located south of San Francisco on the San Francisco Peninsula, bordered by Burlingame to the north, San Mateo to the east, Highlands-Baywood Park to the south, and Interstate 280 to the west. The population was 11,387 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Hillsborough is located on the Rancho San Mateo Mexican land grant which was purchased by William Davis Merry Howard, son of a wealthy Hillsborough, New Hampshire, shipping magnate, in 1846. Howard settled his family in this area, which attracted wealthy San Franciscans. On May 5, 1910, Hillsborough residents voted to incorporate. From the town&#x27;s foundation until 1963, it was an exclusive community for wealthy whites. In 1963, Jack and Betty Ken, the first-generation children of Chinese Immigrants, purchased land in the town. This made them the first non-white people to own land in the town, effectively desegregating Hillsborough.

==Geography and environment==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land. The area&#x27;s considerably winding, hilly topography, and impossibility of a grid layout make Hillsborough notoriously challenging to navigate. Many lots include fairly steep slopes, particularly the western side of the town, with the landscape generally flattening to the east as it descends from the 280 freeway to El Camino Real and the towns of Burlingame and San Mateo.

Three prominent streams drain the mostly wooded slopes of Hillsborough: San Mateo Creek, Cherry Canyon Creek, and Sanchez Creek. In all 3 cases the upper watersheds are closed-canopy California oak woodlands, with dominant trees of Coast Live Oak, Pacific Madrone and California Bay.

The upper drainage area of San Mateo Creek in Hillsborough contains significant serpentinite outcrops, which are known habitats for several rare plant species including the San Mateo woolly sunflower. Other common plants include toyon, gooseberry, lupine, monkeyflower and coffeeberry. Commonly observed mammals include California mule deer, raccoons, opossum, coyotes, rabbits, squirrels, and skunks. Mountain lions are known to live and roam in the green belts that surround the city.

Hillsborough is bordered by Burlingame to the north, San Mateo to the east, Highlands-Baywood Park to the south, and Interstate 280 to the west.

Hillsborough&#x27;s landscape is dominated by large homes; the town zoning and subdivision ordinances require a minimum house size and minimum lot size of . As a result, there are no apartments, condominiums or townhouses in the city limits.

The town has no commercial zoning and thus no businesses within the town limits; the only non-residential properties are the town&#x27;s four public and three private schools, town and county government facilities, a golf course, a country club, and small parks.

<text>Millbrae is a city located in northern San Mateo County, California, United States. To the northeast is San Francisco International Airport; San Bruno is to the northwest, and Burlingame is to the southeast. It is bordered by San Andreas Lake to the southwest. The population was 23,216 at the 2020 census. Millbrae has Sister City relationships with La Serena, Chile and Mosta, Malta, as well as a friendship city agreement with Hanyu, Japan, Taishan, China, Ramallah, Palestine, and Dongguan, China. 

==History==

The oral tradition of the Ohlone people suggests they have been living in the Bay Area for thousands of years. Anthropological evidence suggests Ohlone ethnogenesis occurred around 700 CE following a wave of migration from the Central Valley. The local Ohlone people are today called the Ramaytush Ohlone; however, this name is a linguistic designation that arose relatively recently. Prior to colonization, the Ohlone did not operate as a single consolidated unit; they identified more with their local tribe and village than with the nation at large. The several local tribes that lived in the area prior to colonization coalesced into the modern Ramaytush people following the precipitous decline of their population in the 1800s. The closest villages to what is now Millbrae were located by the banks of San Bruno Creek, and they are known as Urebure and Siplichiquin. A third nearby village—whose original name is unknown—is called CA-SMA-299.

=== 1500s ===
Anthropological evidence and oral tradition indicate the Ohlone people were living in the Bay Area prior to the 1500s. The Spanish empire claimed much of what is now the United States during the early period of Spanish colonization of the Americas. In 1535, the Spanish empire established the kingdom of New Spain, which inherited the empire&#x27;s claims to much of what is now the western United States.

In 1542, Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo explored the Pacific coast near what is today Millbrae, though the expedition did not see the Golden Gate or the San Francisco Bay, likely due to the San Francisco fog. The Ohlone people may have met this expedition as they explored the Monterey Bay, about 50 miles southeast of Millbrae.

In 1595, Philip II of Spain tasked Sebastião Rodrigues Soromenho with mapping the west coast of the Americas. Soromenho set sail on Manila Galleon &quot;San Agustin&quot; on July 5, 1595, and in early November they reached land between Point St. George and Trinidad Head. The expedition followed the coast southward and on November 7 the &quot;San Agustin&quot; anchored in Drakes Bay, about 40 miles northwest of Millbrae. In late November, a storm sank the &quot;San Agustin&quot; and killed between 7 and 12 people. On December 8, 80 remaining crew members set sail on the &quot;San Buenaventura&quot;, a launch which was partially constructed en route from the Philippines. Seeking the fastest route south, the expedition failed to notice the Golden Gate, arriving at Puerto de Chacala, Mexico on January 17, 1596.

=== 1600s ===
In 1601, New Spain tasked Sebastián Vizcaíno with mapping the California coastline in detail and locating safe harbors in Alta California for Manila Galleons to use on their return voyage to Acapulco from Manila. In 1602, members of Vizcaíno&#x27;s expedition explored as far north as Coos Bay, however like previous expeditions, they missed the Golden Gate. In 1603, this expedition landed in Monterey Bay, about 50 miles southeast of Millbrae, leading to the first documented interaction between the Ohlone people and European explorers. Little came of this expedition, and for the next 150 years, Alta California remained a distant frontier land, largely outside of the kingdom&#x27;s control, despite its claims. Anthropological evidence and oral tradition indicate the Ohlone people were living in the Bay Area throughout this time.

=== 1700s ===
The San Francisco Bay may have been explored and mapped in the early 1700s. José Cabrera Bueno&#x27;s 1734 &quot;Navegación Espéculativa y Práctica&quot; describe it with the following:Through the opening in the center enters an estuary of salt water without any breaking of the waves at all, and by going in one will find friendly Indians and can easily take on water and wood.On November 4, 1769, the Portolà expedition climbed Sweeney Ridge and descended southeast parallel to San Andreas Creek before camping overnight near what is today San Andreas Lake and Millbrae&#x27;s western border. The Portolà expedition continued southeast along the peninsula before turning back and returning to San Diego.

Gaspar de Portolá returned to the Bay Area the following year, accompanied by Junípero Serra, who established Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo—the second Spanish mission in Alta California—in what is today Monterey on June 3, 1770. Between 1769 and 1824 a total of 21 missions were established across Alta California.

The sixth Spanish mission in Alta California, Mission San Francisco de Asís was established on October 9, 1776, in what is today San Francisco&#x27;s Mission District, about 10 miles north of Millbrae. Over the next few decades, many of the Ohlone people who lived in and around what is today Millbrae relocated to Mission San Francisco de Asís, where they were baptized. Nearly all the Indigenous people of the area around what is today Millbrae were baptized between 1777 and 1783, and by 1793, the 8 village sites in what are today San Francisco and northern San Mateo county had been abandoned and most of the Indigenous people of that area had relocated to Mission San Francisco.

The missions maintained authority over much of Alta California even after Mexico&#x27;s independence from Spain 1821.

=== 1800s ===
The First Mexican Empire came and went with little change for residents of the area. The First Mexican Republic was established in 1824, and one of the most significant changes came when José María de Echeandía, Governor of Alta California, issued a &quot;Proclamation of Emancipation&quot; (or &quot;&quot;Prevenciónes de Emancipacion&quot;) on July 25, 1826. Following this proclamation, the Indigenous people within the military districts of San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Monterey who were found qualified were freed from missionary rule and made eligible to become Mexican citizens. In 1827, Echeandía granted permission for sub-lieutenant José Antonio Sánchez to occupy Mission San Francisco&#x27;s Rancho Buri Buri—which included parts of present-day Millbrae and Burlingame—for “grazing and agricultural purposes.&quot;

The Mexican Secularization Act of 1833 opened the lands of nearby Mission Dolores to civilian settlement, and the small town of Yerba Buena, which later changed its name to San Francisco, was established that year. Settlement was slow however; in 1847 San Francisco was said to have only 459 residents. Few people lived in what is now Millbrae at this time, likely only a few Californio families. California came under American rule in 1848 following the Mexican–American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and the Mexican Cession and California became the 31st state in of the United States in 1850. The discovery of gold relatively nearby in 1848 led to massive population growth, with San Francisco&#x27;s population growing 5446% in just a few years, from 459 residents in 1847 to 25,000 in 1850. San Francisco County was one of the state&#x27;s 18 original counties established at California statehood in 1850, however in 1856, the California state government divided the county. A straight line was then drawn across the tip of the San Francisco Peninsula just north of San Bruno Mountain, and everything south of the line became the new San Mateo County while everything north of the line became the new consolidated City and County of San Francisco.

In the 1860s, Darius Ogden Mills purchased a portion of Rancho Buri Buri from José de la Cruz Sánchez to build a country estate. The San Francisco and San Jose Railroad, predecessor to Caltrain, began operations in 1863, directly connecting Millbrae and other peninsula towns to Market Street, with service extending to San Jose in 1864. In 1872, members of the Sánchez family built the original Sixteen Mile House, a historical restaurant and rest stop near the Mills estate, and direct link to Millbrae&#x27;s early days. The Mills estate was bordered by what is now Skyline Boulevard, U.S. Route 101 (the Bayshore Freeway), Millbrae Avenue and Trousdale Drive. The estate became known as &quot;Millbrae&quot; from &quot;Mills&quot; and the Scottish word &quot;brae,&quot; which means &quot;rolling hills&quot; or &quot;hill slope.&quot; Millbrae grew slowly during the 19th century; according to the 1890 US Census, the town had only 243 residents.

The early 20th century saw rapid growth in Millbrae&#x27;s population, which increased 3692% from 243 in 1890 to 8,972 in 1950. Transportation has shaped Millbrae&#x27;s growth; Legislative Route Number (LRN) 2, which is today known as California State Route 82 or El Camino Real, was established in 1909 largely parallel to the San Francisco and San Jose Railroad, and in 1919, Skyline Boulevard, which runs along Millbrae&#x27;s western boundary, was established as LRN 55, connecting San Francisco and Santa Cruz via the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Construction on the Bayshore Freeway, which runs parallel to El Camino and the SF&amp;SJ railroad tracks, began in 1924 and by 1929, it connected Millbrae with the East Bay via the newly completed San Mateo-Hayward Bridge. Southern Pacific double tracked the SF&amp;SJ railroad in 1904 and by the 1940s, 26 trains ran between SF and SJ per day, with headways as low as 5 minutes (traveling north) in the mornings and 3 minutes (traveling south) in the evening. Additionally, until 1948, Muni&#x27;s #40 &quot;interurban&quot; streetcar traveled through Millbrae, providing passenger rail service between San Francisco and San Mateo.

Millbrae&#x27;s Green Hills Country Club was built in 1929 and designed by famed golf course architect Dr. Alister MacKenzie, who also designed other noteworthy courses such as Augusta National, Cypress Point, Royal Melbourne, and Pasatiempo. The course was originally known as the Union League Golf Club of San Francisco (1930 to 1933) and Millbrae Country Club (1933 to 1945). The course provides a green belt in the center of the city that is the home of many animals, such as the red-tail fox, that otherwise would not be able to survive in the urban setting. It also may be the only area of the city where natural creeks still flow above ground.

In 1931, citizens organized a volunteer fire department, which remained entirely volunteer until 1938. The police and fire departments were housed together for several years at Hillcrest Boulevard and El Camino Real before the vital services moved to their permanent location in Millbrae&#x27;s civic center, a few blocks west of El Camino. Millbrae used a private patrol financed by fees from merchants and residents until 1941, when the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors created the Millbrae Police District. Records of the Internal Revenue Service document the licensing of several Millbrae bars for gambling; only after incorporation were gambling laws enforced in Millbrae and not until the 1950s was gambling defeated.

In the 1940s, a hilltop was shaved away to produce landfill for the expanding San Francisco Airport, which received an &quot;international&quot; designation in 1954 with the completion of the Central Terminal. Spurred largely by the desire to secure the Mills estate for residential use and by the efforts of Millbrae&#x27;s weekly newspaper, the &quot;Millbrae Sun&quot;, residents heatedly discussed incorporation for over a decade before voting to incorporate. Finally, on January 14, 1948, residents of Millbrae traveled to Sacramento to present their new city&#x27;s charter. W.F. Leutenegger was elected mayor to represent Millbrae&#x27;s nearly 8,000 residents. That year, Green Hills Elementary School opened as Millbrae&#x27;s first new school in over 25 years, in anticipation of the educational needs of the post-war &quot;baby boom&quot; children. The new city&#x27;s chief industries were agriculture, floriculture, dairy, and porcelain manufacturing.

In the 1950s, Millbrae residents united to resist efforts to divide the city by the planned Junipero Serra Freeway (I-280), which was later routed parallel to Junipero Serra Boulevard, then through a canyon in San Bruno up to Skyline Boulevard. The streetcar line that connected Millbrae with San Francisco and San Mateo was dismantled just after Millbrae&#x27;s incorporation in 1948, leaving the Southern Pacific Railroad as the only railway linking Millbrae with surrounding areas. Millbrae&#x27;s high school students rode the streetcar to attend Burlingame High School until Capuchino High School opened on September 11, 1950. The original Sixteen Mile House was located where Millbrae O&#x27;Reilly Auto Parts stands today, at the intersection of El Camino Real and Center Street. The Millbrae estate mansion burned down in June 1954. After the fire the estate was subdivided and sold, with the bulk of the land going to the Paul W. Trousdale Construction Company in 1953 and eventually becoming the location for Mills High School, Spring Valley Elementary School, and Peninsula Hospital.

An unsuccessful effort to save the original Sixteen Mile House in the 1970s led to the birth of the Millbrae Historical Society and eventual successful crusades to save the Millbrae train station and the historic building that has become the Millbrae Historical Museum. Such challenges, though inevitable, have only strengthened Millbrae&#x27;s resolve to preserve the city&#x27;s unique character and rich history. 

Millbrae&#x27;s population skyrocketed for decades, increasing 10728% from 195 residents in 1880 to just shy of 21,000 in 1970, however the population decreased 4.1% between 1970 and 1980, and Millbrae would not reach its 1970 peak again until after the 2000 census. 

=== 2000s ===
Following its population loss in the 1970s, and its negligible growth in the 1980s and &#x27;90s, Millbrae&#x27;s population began to rebound in the early 21st century. The population of Millbrae was 20,718 at the 2000 census, 21,532 at the 2010 census, and 23,216 at the 2020 census. This growth may be attributed to a recent shift towards constructing transit-oriented development; in 1998, Millbrae created an area-specific plan for the Millbrae station area, in 2007, a lot near Millbrae station with surface parking and a large single story retail building was redeveloped into the condo buildings at 88 S. Broadway, in 2010 a large surface parking lot with two small retail buildings across El Camino Real from Millbrae station was redeveloped as the Belamor Condo Buildings. and in 2023, three large surface parking lots adjacent to Millbrae station were redeveloped as the Gateway at Millbrae, which maintained some surface parking, and created a new hotel, a new office building, and two new apartment buildings—one of which features ground-floor retail space. Several chains including Chick-fil-A, Panda Express, Crumbl Cookies, and Starbucks have signed leases to move into the new retail space at the Gateway. 

Transportation continues to be a large driver of Millbrae&#x27;s growth; SFO has become one of the busiest airports in the world, Junipero Serra Freeway, El Camino Real, and the Bayshore Freeway remain major thoroughfares between San Francisco and San Jose, and since 2003 Millbrae station has been the only station served by both BART and Caltrain. Millbrae station is also the only planned California High-Speed Rail stop between San Francisco and San José. In 2023, SamTrans announced that it would move its headquarters from San Carlos to the new office building at the Gateway at Millbrae, and in 2024, Caltrain, whose headquarters was in the same San Carlos building as SamTrans, announced that they would join SamTrans in relocating to the new office building at the Gateway. Millbrae nevertheless largely remains a bedroom community whose residents commute to jobs in various industries throughout the Bay Area. 

In addition to the increasing awareness that came with becoming a BART terminus in the early 2000s, the city gained notoriety in the early 2020s following spats with the California High-Speed Rail Authority and the San Mateo County government, as well as a possible hate crime targeting then councilmember Anders Fung.

<text>Montara () is a census-designated place (CDP) in San Mateo County, California, United States. The population was 2,833 at the 2020 census. Nearby communities include Moss Beach and Princeton-by-the-Sea.

==Etymology==

According to historical sources, the name &quot;Montoro&quot; was initially used, at least in 1867, for Montara Mountain and Montara Point by the Whitney Survey (also known as the California Geological Survey). In 1869, the United States Coast Survey referred to the area by its current name of Montara; the name is thought to be a misspelled interpretation of a Spanish word, or even a combination of several Spanish words for mountains or wilderness, such as &quot;montuoso&quot; (mountainous), &quot;montaraz&quot; (the wild) or the word for mountain, &quot;montaña&quot;. Additionally, the Spanish verb &quot;montar&quot; (meaning “to ride”), or one of its conjugated forms, could have influenced the name by referencing “riding” through or traversing the land on horseback or by wagon. &quot;Montará&quot; is a future-tense conjugation of “to ride”, becoming “will ride”, more or less. This could have been further confused by non-Spanish speakers as sounding like “montaña” (mountain), interpreted as “riding the mountain”.

“Montara” could also refer to a corruption of the Spanish word &quot;Montosa&quot;; &quot;Cañada Montosa&quot; (valley of brush) was allegedly written on an 1838 design of Rancho San Pedro, located in Southern California, but the connections between this plan and the town are unclear.

==Geography and environment==
Montara is located at (37.539639, -122.506426), approximately south of San Francisco and north of Santa Cruz, California. Neighboring towns include Pacifica to the north, Moss Beach, El Granada, and Half Moon Bay to the south. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land.

The rare and endangered species Hickman&#x27;s potentilla occurs at the northern extremity of Montara on the slopes above Martini Creek at elevations ranging from .

Nearby Montara Mountain, part of the Santa Cruz Mountains, rises to an elevation of above sea level. The mountain is accessible by a gravel fire road. On a few occasions light snowfall has fallen on the upper reaches of the mountain.

The town is surrounded by open space (Rancho Corral de Tierra) and a popular recreation area includes Montara State Beach. The nearly long stretch of sand drops steeply into the ocean, making this beach hazardous for swimming. It is, however, a fairly popular surfing destination for experienced surfers. Waves of at least can be common during winter storm swells.

Montara State Marine Reserve &amp; Pillar Point State Marine Conservation Area extend offshore from Montara. Like underwater parks, these marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.

==Climate==
Montara enjoys exceptionally mild weather throughout the year. Typical of Northern California, most of the rainfall falls from November through April, normally totaling more than . Due to its proximity to the Pacific Ocean, heavy fogs and low overcasts are common throughout the year, sometimes producing light drizzle. Stray showers sometimes occur during the mostly dry summer months. January, the coldest month, normally sees daytime high temperatures around 50°-60 °F (between 10° and 15 °C), with overnight lows in the forties (4°-10 °C). Freezing temperatures are extremely rare, especially near the ocean. September, the warmest month, normally experiences daytime highs in the upper sixties (15°-21 °C) and lows in the lower fifties (around 10 °C). Temperatures rarely exceed , and, whenever there are daytime temperatures above , the overall temperate still cools into the fifties (~13 °C) at night. During experimental observations by a U.S. Geological Survey volunteer (from 1985 to 1989), the highest temperature was an amazing , and the lowest was . The nearest official National Weather Service station is at Half Moon Bay. Recently, an automated weather station was set up in Montara, providing regular observations on the National Weather Service&#x27;s website, weather.gov.

==Government==
In the California State Legislature, Montara is in , and in .

In the United States House of Representatives, Montara is in .

Montara is an unincorporated community. All planning and zoning is the responsibility of the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors, which is elected at large by the voters of San Mateo County. The Midcoast Community Council is an elected advisory body to the Board of Supervisors, is chosen by residents of Montara, Moss Beach, and El Granada.

Montara is also part of the Cabrillo Unified School District, Coastside Fire Protection District, Montara Water and Sanitary District, and the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District. Because it is in the coastal zone, Montara is under the jurisdiction of the California Coastal Commission.

==History==

A lighthouse was established at Point Montara in 1875. The Montara area was first settled by farmers in the late nineteenth century. A commercial flower farm, still in operation, was established in 1900. In 1905, Montara became a stop on the new Ocean Shore Railroad, then under construction. The railroad built a hotel next to the train station. The trains encouraged weekend visitors to the area, but development of the community was very slow. The railroad went bankrupt and ceased operations in 1920, but the hotel remained and, although greatly remodeled, is still standing today, between State Route 1 and Main Street, next to the remodeled train station.

The Montara Grammar School opened in 1915; the historic two-story building still stands, serving as a community center. The newer Farallone View Elementary School, a few blocks north of the original school, services the town&#x27;s children today.

California&#x27;s second paved highway, Pedro Mountain Road, was completed in 1914, providing another connection between Montara and San Francisco. This highway was replaced in 1937 by State Route 1, which followed the old railroad route through the Devil&#x27;s Slide. A tunnel was opened in 2013 to replace this dangerous route, which had been closed periodically due to landslides. The United States Navy operated an anti-aircraft training center at Point Montara during World War II.

Real growth in Montara began in the 1950s as more people moved away from San Francisco during the postwar boom. As Montara has continued to grow, the community has still maintained its generally rural image. Most of Montara&#x27;s streets were dirt or gravel until the early 1990s; the rustic quality of the town has not been lost since the streets were oiled or paved (only some of the streets are actually paved).

== Notable ==

In 2003, Montara Water and Sanitary District purchased its water system from the German industrial firm RWE. Montara and Moss Beach residents overwhelmingly supported a bond for the purchase and repair of the system. The high, spiraling rates and a decades-long water moratorium were key motivations behind the bond measure.

Point Montara Light is a lighthouse in Montara, located just west of the Cabrillo Highway at Point Montara. Montara Light was originally established in 1875 as a fog signal station after several ships ran ashore in the late 1860s. The cast-iron lighthouse was brought from Wellfleet Harbor, Cape Cod, Massachusetts in 1925. It continues to operate as an aid-to-navigation maintained by the U.S. Coast Guard. The lighthouse demarks the northern point of the Fitzgerald Marine Reserve, a holding of Special Biological Significance owned by the State of California. The lighthouse grounds also serve for an international hostel, Point Montara Lighthouse.

==Transportation==
Primary road access is via State Route 1 (the Cabrillo Highway) from the north and south.

SamTrans route 117 provides service to Montara with service from Linda Mar in Pacifica to Half Moon Bay.

<text>North Fair Oaks is a census-designated place and an unincorporated area located in San Mateo County, California adjacent to Redwood City, Atherton, and Menlo Park. As of the 2020 census the area had a total population of 14,027. Because of the large number of residents from one Mexican state the area is also known as Little [[Michoacán de Ocampo|Michoacán]]. The larger area including North Fair Oaks and adjacent parts of Redwood City has a large Hispanic/Latino population and is known locally as Little Mexico. The neighborhood is distinctive, as it is one out of only three communities (the others being East Palo Alto and Pescadero) in San Mateo County that have a majority-Hispanic/Latino population.

== History ==
Fair Oaks was a residential area north of Menlo Park. In 1923, Menlo Park attempted to incorporate Fair Oaks first, but instead, Fair Oaks incorporated itself separately as the town of Atherton (see Atherton for details and history). This left North Fair Oaks unincorporated.

One of the two Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct utility corridors on the San Francisco Peninsula was installed through the area at an angle diagonal to the existing street grid.

==Geography and climate==
North Fair Oaks is located at (37.475170, -122.203506).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the area has a total area of , all of it land.

Proximity to mountains by the Pacific coast and the San Francisco Bay creates a microclimate that makes the area sunny and warm with temperatures moderated by ocean and bay breezes most of the time. Similar conditions are also found on the Canary Islands and the Mediterranean coast of North Africa. This local microclimate is centered on nearby Redwood City which claims the slogan &quot;climate best by government test&quot;.

== Law and government ==
Essential services are provided through San Mateo County by the Board of Supervisors using input from the North Fair Oaks Community Council. They also are included within the boundaries of the Sequoia Healthcare District, which provides health care benefits supported by property taxes collected from District residents. 

Children attend elementary school in the Redwood City School District, but then attend Menlo-Atherton High School within the Sequoia Union High School District.

<text>Pacifica (, meaning &quot;Peaceful&quot;) is a city in San Mateo County, California, on the coast of the Pacific Ocean between San Francisco and Half Moon Bay.

==Overview==
The City of Pacifica is spread along a stretch of sandy coastal beaches and hills in north central California. The city comprises several small valleys spread between Sweeney Ridge in the east, Montara Mountain to the south, and the Pacific Ocean&#x27;s rocky bluffs to the west.
Pacifica is well known regionally as a popular surfing destination. Surfers and families often visit Linda Mar Beach. Rockaway Beach is a scenic location and offers recreation, shopping and dining. 2005 marked the opening of the top ranked Pacifica Skatepark. Pacifica is also a popular mountain biking destination, with many trails crossing the hillsides that surround the city, including Pedro Mountain Road, Sweeney Ridge, and areas of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Fishermen frequent the local beaches and the Pacifica Pier, often catching striped bass and salmon. Pacifica is also a popular place to hike, with many trails that wind along the beaches and bluffs, including Mori Point, San Pedro Valley County Park, Frontierland Park, the Sanchez Adobe, Milagra Ridge, and the privately owned Rockaway Quarry. For live local theater and performing arts, Pacifica Spindrift Players is a local and popular favorite, in addition to Pacifica Performances which regularly provides both musical presentations and performing arts as well. Pacifica is also home to the Sharp Park Golf Course, which was designed in 1931 by architect Alister MacKenzie. The world class bromeliad nursery, Shelldance Orchid Gardens is located just off Highway 1 in Pacifica, adjacent to the Sweeney Ridge hiking trailhead.

Pacifica is divided into roughly eleven districts from north to south:

#Fairmont
#Westview (Pacific Highlands)
#Pacific Manor (Manor)
#Edgemar
#Sharp Park 
#Fairway Park 
#Vallemar
# Rockaway Beach
#Pedro Point and Shelter Cove in the south west 
#Linda Mar, Linda Mar Valley, (formerly Pedro Valley or San Pedro Valley) in the south.
#Park Pacifica in south east portions of the city (called the Back of the Valley).

==History==

Before European settlers arrived, Pacifica was home to two significant Ohlone Indian villages: Pruristac located at San Pedro Creek near present-day Adobe Drive, and Timigtac on Calera Creek in the Rockaway Beach neighborhood.

Pacifica is the location of the oldest European encounter with the San Francisco Bay. An expedition led by Gaspar de Portolà sighted the bay by climbing the hills of Sweeney Ridge in Pacifica on November 4, 1769. Before then, earlier Spanish maritime explorers of the California coast Juan Cabrillo and Sebastian Vizcaino had missed the San Francisco Bay because heavy fog so frequently shrouded its entrance from the Pacific Ocean (the Golden Gate). Sighting the San Francisco Bay accelerated the Spanish colonization of Alta California because it was the only large, safe, centrally located harbor on the Alta California coast. The Spanish had known about Monterey Bay since the sixteenth century, but, unlike San Francisco Bay, it was too exposed to rough currents and winds to be used as major harbor for their trade between Asia and Mexico. In the Spanish era, Pacifica was the site of the San Pedro Valley Mission Outpost (1786–1793) of Mission Dolores. That was dissolved when a newly independent Mexico secularized the mission system. Pacifica is also the site of the still-extant Mexican-era Sánchez Adobe, built in 1846. The city is located on a part of the Mexican land grant Rancho San Pedro given to Francisco Sanchez in 1839.

During World War II, the area around the present-day Sharp Park recreational area held the Sharp Park Detention Station, an INS processing facility for Japanese Americans, Japanese nationals, and other &quot;foreign enemies&quot; during Japanese internment. The Stanford professor Yamato Ichihashi spent six weeks in Sharp Park. He described the facility, writing, &quot;The ground is limited by tall iron net-fences and small in area; barracks 20&#x27; x 120&#x27; are well-built and painted outside and inside and are regularly arranged; there are 10 of these for inmates, each accommodating about 40, divided into 5 rooms for 8 persons each; if double-decked (beds), 80 can be put in.&quot;

On February 20, 1956, the Hazel&#x27;s Inn raid occurred in Sharp Park. Sheriff Earl Whitmore told the &quot;San Mateo County Times&quot; at the time, &quot;The purpose of the raid was to let it be known that we are not going to tolerate gatherings of homosexuals in this county.&quot; Ninety people were arrested that night, and the majority were San Francisco residents.

Pacifica was incorporated in 1957, relatively recently in the history of San Mateo County. Its first elected mayor was Jean Fassler, one of the first women mayors in California. It was the union of nine previously separate, unincorporated communities–Fairmont, Westview, Pacific Manor (or just Manor), Sharp Park, Fairway Park, Vallemar, Rockaway Beach, Linda Mar and Pedro Point–some of which were stops on the short-lived Ocean Shore Railroad. The name &quot;Pacifica&quot; was chosen from Thomas Barca, by vote; &quot;Coastside&quot; was a close runner-up.

<text>Portola Valley is an incorporated town in San Mateo County, California, United States. Located on the San Francisco Peninsula in the Bay Area, Portola Valley is a small, wealthy community nestled on the eastern slopes of the Santa Cruz Mountains.

== History ==

Portola Valley was named for Spanish explorer Gaspar de Portolá, who led the first party of Europeans to explore the San Francisco Peninsula in 1769.

The Native Americans already present were Ohlone and specifically the group (or groups) known as Olpen or Guemelento but these were later moved to Mission Dolores and Mission Santa Clara de Asís which claimed the land and peoples. 
The area&#x27;s written history dates back to 1833, when a square league of land was given to Domingo Peralta and Máximo Martínez by Governor José Figueroa to form the Rancho Cañada del Corte de Madera. In those days it was used for lumbering and cattle grazing.

By the 1880s Andrew S. Hallidie, a wire rope manufacturer, had built his country home of Eagle Home Farm in what is now Portola Valley. He built a 7,341 foot long aerial tramway from his house to the top of Skyline in 1894 though it was removed after his death in 1900.

In 1886 the name Portola-Crespi Valley was bestowed on the area from the then community of Crystal Springs (now under Crystal Springs Reservoir to the then community of Searsville (in the area of the present day Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve); Crespi is for Juan Crespí, a Franciscan friar with the Portolà expedition.

The town was incorporated in 1964. Bill Lane, known as the publisher of &quot;Sunset&quot; magazine, was the first mayor.

===Housing issues===
In recent years, due to the California housing shortage, the state government has increased its pressure on local governments to allow construction of more housing, using a process called the Regional Housing Needs Assessment. In late 2021, this assessment declared that Portola Valley needed to allow for the construction of 253 new housing units over the next 8 years. The state requires localities to submit plans to satisfy this requirement detailing how much housing and what types (low-income, luxury housing) the locality has planned for, and to make zoning changes to allow those types of housing to be built. Previously, Portola Valley&#x27;s exclusionary zoning has not allowed any multifamily housing, resulting in a town that is much whiter and wealthier than average for the area, (75% white vs. 35% in San Mateo county as a whole), with the median household income at $250,000 and the average home costing $3.8 million.

In 2023, during the process of generating the town&#x27;s housing plan (called a &quot;housing element&quot;), NIMBY homeowners lashed out at the town&#x27;s workers and Councilmembers, resulting in over two thirds of the town&#x27;s employees quitting and several of the Councilmembers being replaced. Additionally, according to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, about a dozen residents threatened the mayor that if housing plans were not to their liking, they would sue the town in order to force the town to incur such large litigation costs that it would go bankrupt.

In March 2024, the California Department of Housing and Community Development decertified Portola Valley&#x27;s housing plan because the town had failed to re-zone to allow for the new housing. By December 2024, fiscal issues arising from the higher costs of using consultants to do the jobs of employees who quit, the costs of lawsuits fighting residents who oppose new housing, and an expected 60% increase in costs for the policing contract with the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office, led some to consider dissolving Portola Valley and merging it with the county or another nearby city, Woodside.

==Geography==
Portola Valley is located on the San Francisco Peninsula on the eastern slope of the Santa Cruz Mountains. The town is west of Interstate 280 and the southwest boundary is along Skyline Boulevard which more or less is the ridge of the mountains. The Windy Hill Open Space Preserve is a large part of the town&#x27;s southwest side and the north side of the town borders Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve. Woodside borders it to the northwest and Palo Alto to the southeast The unincorporated subdivision of Ladera is adjacent to the northern boundary of the town. It is in a mostly wooded area, with some open fields. The San Andreas Fault bisects the town.

Alpine Road and Portola Road are the two relatively main roads in the town and their intersection forms a small shopping nexus.

Portola Valley can generally be divided into 7 subdivisions: Central Portola Valley, The Ranch, Corte Madera, Los Trancos/Vista Verde, Woodside Highlands, Westridge, and Blue Oaks.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , 99.98% of it land and 0.02% of it water.

Portola Valley School is a one-room former school house built in 1909 and is on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. It is now used for town council meetings.
The Alpine Inn, also known as &quot;Casa de Tableta&quot;, &quot;Rossotti&#x27;s&quot; or &quot;Zott&#x27;s&quot;, is one of the oldest existing drinking establishments in California; it started around 1852 when Felix Buelna built it as a gambling house. The first two-network TCP/IP transmission was between a specialized SRI van and ARPANET on August 27, 1976; the van was parked next to the Alpine Inn and wires were run to one of the picnic tables. In 2018, the inn was acquired by new owners, who closed it temporarily for remodeling. It was re-opened in August 2019.

=== Trails ===
Portola Valley is known for its expansive trail network both maintained by the town and also in the Windy Hill Open Space Preserve maintained by the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District.

<doc id="108120" wikidata="Q505549" url="?curid=108120" title="Redwood City, California">
<text>Redwood City is a city on the San Francisco Peninsula in Northern California&#x27;s Bay Area, approximately south of San Francisco, and northwest of San Jose. Redwood City&#x27;s history spans its earliest inhabitation by the Ohlone people to being a port for lumber and other goods. The county seat of San Mateo County in the heart of Silicon Valley, Redwood City is home to several global technology companies including Oracle, Electronic Arts, Evernote, Box, and Informatica. The city&#x27;s population was 84,292 according to the 2020 census. The Port of Redwood City is the only deepwater port on San Francisco Bay south of San Francisco.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and , comprising 44.34%, is water. One major watercourse draining much of Redwood City is Redwood Creek, to which several significant river deltas connect, the largest of which is Westpoint Slough.

==History==
The earliest known inhabitants of the area that would become Redwood City were the Ohlone, who were present when the Spanish claimed the land and established missions.

Redwood City incorporated in 1867, being the first city in San Mateo County to do so; it has remained the county seat since the county&#x27;s formation in 1856. The land had been part of the Rancho de las Pulgas granted to the Argüello family in 1835 by the Mexican government. Their control was challenged after the Mexican–American War when California became part of the United States. The family lawyer, Simon M. Mezes, in 1854 defended the claim somewhat successfully and was allowed to buy the part of the estate that is now Redwood City. Mezes sold some of the land to people already squatting on it along the banks of Redwood Creek and named the settlement &quot;Mezesville&quot;. Though the city did not keep that name, Mezes Park still exists on land that Mezes had given for open space.
In 1907, Eikichi and Sadakusi Enomoto, Japanese immigrant brothers, grew what may perhaps have been the first commercially grown chrysanthemums in the United States in Redwood City. In 1926, the chamber of commerce proclaimed the city the &quot;Chrysanthemum Center of the World&quot; though the internment of Japanese Americans in 1941 and other factors would contribute to the end of flower growing as a major industry in the city.

== Geography ==
Redwood City stretches from the San Francisco Bay towards the Santa Cruz Mountains between San Carlos to the northwest and Atherton to the southeast with Woodside to the southwest. It is divided by Highway 101 and further inland El Camino Real on the northwest–southeast axis and &quot;Woodside Road&quot; on the north-northeast/south-southwest axis. Locally, the former two are regarded as north–south and the latter east/west, as 101 and El Camino connects Redwood City to San Francisco and San Jose and Woodside Road runs from San Francisco Bay to the Santa Cruz Mountains.

Neighborhoods include Bair Island to the northeast of Highway 101. The northern planned community of Redwood Shores, also to the northeast of Highway 101, is part of Redwood City, although it is not possible to travel by road from one to the other without passing through the neighboring city of San Carlos, or through Belmont via San Mateo County. Stretching along Highway 101 to the southeast of Woodside Road is Friendly Acres, further inland and still to the southeast of Woodside Road are Redwood Village and then Redwood Oaks. Most neighborhoods are to the northwest of Woodside Road and southwest of Highway 101. Centennial, Downtown, and Stambaugh Heller are adjacent to 101. Next inland are Edgewood, Mt. Carmel, Central and Palm then Canyon, Eagle Hill, Roosevelt, and Woodside Plaza. Furthest inland is Farm Hills (or Farm Hill).

Neighborhoods associated with Redwood City but not part of the incorporated city include Emerald Lake Hills and Kensington Square inland and to the north and 
North Fair Oaks to the southeast. Palomar Park, just north of Emerald Hills and east of San Carlos&#x27; Crestview area, is another Redwood City neighborhood that is formally part of unincorporated San Mateo County. Although Redwood City has a large middle class, the southeastern section of Redwood City strongly resembles working-class North Fair Oaks in both demographic makeup and income level.

=== Downtown ===

In an attempt to revitalize Redwood City&#x27;s downtown, city officials decided to consider development. In February 1999, the San Mateo County History Museum opened inside the old San Mateo County Courthouse in downtown Redwood City. The courthouse had been built in 1910 and in the late &#x27;30s an addition was built in front of the original structure, obscuring the view. As part of the revitalization, this addition was torn down and replaced with a large courtyard flanked by water fountains on either side, leading to the main steps of the courthouse. The courthouse&#x27;s glass dome is lit at night and changes colors every 11 seconds.

In August 2006, a 20-screen theater and various shops opened in a prime downtown location. The theater complex boasts restaurant and retail space at street level and a two-level underground parking structure.

<text>San Bruno () is a city in San Mateo County, California, United States, incorporated in 1914. The population was 43,908 at the 2020 United States Census. The city is between South San Francisco and Millbrae, adjacent to San Francisco International Airport and Golden Gate National Cemetery; it is approximately south of Downtown San Francisco.

==Geography==
The city is located between South San Francisco and Millbrae, adjacent to San Francisco International Airport to the east and Golden Gate National Cemetery to the northwest. It is approximately south of Downtown San Francisco.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. The city spreads from the mostly flat lowlands near San Francisco Bay into the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains, which rise to more than above sea level in Crestmoor and more than above sea level in Portola Highlands. San Bruno City Hall sits at an official elevation of above sea level.

Portions of Mills Park, Crestmoor, and Rollingwood are very hilly, featuring canyons and ravines. Creeks, many of them now in culverts, flow from springs in the hills toward San Francisco Bay. Just west of Skyline Boulevard and outside of city limits is San Andreas Lake, which got its name from the San Andreas Fault. The lake is one of several reservoirs used by the San Francisco Water Department, providing water to San Francisco and several communities in San Mateo County, including San Bruno west of I-280.

==Climate==

San Bruno has a mild Mediterranean climate characterized by mild to warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. San Bruno has much milder temperatures than most of the state. Owing to its relatively mild temperatures, the city&#x27;s climate closely resembles that of an oceanic climate. Since 1927, the National Weather Service (formerly the U.S. Weather Bureau) has maintained a weather station at the nearby San Francisco International Airport (formerly Mills Field). According to the official records, January is the coldest month with an average high of and an average low of . Freezing temperatures occur on an average of only 1.3 days annually. The coldest winter temperature on record was on December 11, 1932, a day on which of snow also fell. A week-long cold spell in December 1972 caused hard freezes throughout the area, damaging trees and plants and causing some water pipes to break; the temperature dropped as low as at the airport and in Crestmoor, which also reported snow flurries several times that week. There was of snow at the airport on January 21, 1962, with several inches falling in the hills.

September is the warmest month with an average high of and an average low of . Temperatures exceed on an average of 4.0 days annually. Fog and low overcast are common during the night and morning hours in the summer months, which are generally very dry except for occasional light drizzle from the fog. On rare occasions moisture moving up from tropical storms has produced thunderstorms or showers in the summer. Gusty westerly winds are also common in the afternoon during the summer. The highest summer temperature was on June 14, 1961, breaking a record of set in June 1960. A high of was recorded on July 17, 1988, and a high of was recorded on September 1, 2017. Until August 1, 1993, it had never reached in August, which is one of the foggier months in the area. Due to thermal inversions, summer temperatures in the higher hills are often much higher than at the airport.

Thunderstorms occur several times a year, mostly during the winter months, but are usually quite brief. Total annual precipitation, most of which falls from November to April, ranges from at the nearby National Weather Service station at San Francisco International Airport to over in the higher hills (according to observations by Gayle Rucker for the Army Corps of Engineers and Robert E. Nylund for the U.S. Geological Survey from 1962 to 1985). Nylund also took temperature observations for several years and published weekly weather reports in the &quot;San Bruno Herald&quot; from 1966 to 1969, which were included in official reports for the Golden Gate National Cemetery. The annual average days with measurable precipitation is 65.2 days. The most rainfall in a month at the airport was in February 1998, and the most rainfall in 24 hours was on January 4, 1982. Nylund reported in Crestmoor during a 24-hour period in January 1967. Winter storms are often accompanied by strong southerly winds.

San Bruno City Park, bordered by Crystal Springs Avenue and El Crystal School, is the largest municipal park. It offers shaded walkways and hiking trails, picnic tables, a playground, a small ballpark, a municipal swimming pool, and a recreation center that includes an indoor basketball court once used for training by the San Francisco Warriors basketball team. There are smaller municipal parks in other parts of the city.

Junipero Serra County Park, also accessible from Crystal Springs Avenue, is a park owned by San Mateo County which includes numerous hiking trails, as well as picnic shelters, barbecue pits, and picnic tables. The wilderness area was named for Junípero Serra, a Franciscan friar who founded many of the Spanish missions in California during the eighteenth century; Serra regularly passed through what is now San Bruno whenever he visited the mission at San Francisco. The park is administered by the San Mateo County Parks and Recreation Department, which charges a $6 entry fee for vehicles from the entrance off Crystal Springs Road; there are two pedestrian entrances, one from San Bruno City Park and the other from Helen Drive.

==History==

===Early years===
San Bruno was the location of the Ohlone village &quot;Urebure&quot;. It was explored in November 1769 by a Spanish expedition led by Gaspar de Portolà. Later, more extensive explorations by Bruno de Heceta resulted in the naming of San Bruno Creek after St. Bruno of Cologne, the founder of a medieval monastic order. This creek apparently later gave its name to the community.

With the establishment of the San Francisco de Asís (St. Francis of Assisi) mission, much of the area became pasture for the mission livestock. Following the decline of the missions, the area became part of Rancho Buri Buri granted to José de la Cruz Sánchez, the eleventh &quot;Alcalde&quot; (mayor) of San Francisco. After Jose Antonio Sanchez died, his heirs divided the Rancho and sold it off. Dairy farms later became common in much of the area.

The city began as Clarks&#x27;s Station, a stop on the Butterfield Overland Mail stagecoach route, utilizing an inn built in 1849, which was initially called Thorp&#x27;s Place and later Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin or 14 Mile House. The inn was demolished in 1949 and replaced with a Lucky&#x27;s supermarket (now a Walgreens drugstore, on the corner of El Camino Real and Crystal Springs Avenue). Gus Jenevein (for whom Jenevein Avenue was named) built another landmark called San Bruno House, which burned several times and was not rebuilt after the third fire. A few homes and farms were developed in the area. The railroad between San Francisco and San Jose built a train station at San Bruno in the 1860s. The railroad eventually became part of the Southern Pacific system, which ran both passenger and freight trains on the line. Today it is known as Caltrain.

A U.S. Post Office was first established at San Bruno in 1875. Postal services were discontinued for several months in both 1890 and 1891, then from 1893 to 1898. There has been a post office in San Bruno continuously since 1898. The present post office is located near the Tanforan Shopping Center.

=== 20th century ===
Real growth and development began after the 1906 earthquake and fire. The city&#x27;s first public school was completed in late 1906. With the construction of Edgemont Elementary School in 1910, all classes were moved there and the original school building became a public facility named Green Hall. Another school, North Brae Elementary School, opened in 1912; among its earliest students was future actor Eddie &quot;Rochester&quot; Anderson. Paving of California&#x27;s first state highway, El Camino Real, began in 1912 in front of San Bruno&#x27;s Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin; the highway is now designated as State Route 82. The adjoining San Francisco International Airport opened in early 1927 and included a Weather Bureau station, now operated by the National Weather Service. Charles Lindbergh was an early visitor to the airport, during his national tour following his successful transatlantic flight; his airplane (&quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;) became stuck in the mud.

On January 18, 1911, aviator Eugene Ely made naval aviation history when he took off from Tanforan Racetrack and made a successful landing on the armored cruiser anchored in San Francisco Bay. This marked the first successful shipboard aircraft landing.

Following a campaign by the local newspaper, the &quot;San Bruno Herald&quot;, the community was incorporated in 1914, mainly so the streets could be paved. Green Hall became the first city hall. San Bruno grew rapidly, passing 1,500 residents by 1920 and 3,610 residents in 1930. Additional schools, including New Edgemont (later renamed Decima Allen) and Crystal Springs, were built during the 1940s.

In 1930, the El Camino Theater opened at the corner of El Camino Real and San Mateo Avenue. The popular theater, wired for sound, replaced the earlier Melody Theater, which had presented silent films. The El Camino showed double features, cartoons, short comedies, adventure serials, and newsreels during its history, including Saturday matinees and summer Wednesday matinees for children. Normally, films changed every week, but in 1958 Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; ran for two weeks to packed audiences. The theater closed in the early 1970s when a four-screen movie theater opened in the Tanforan shopping center. The El Camino Theater building was remodeled, but later demolished. The lot is now home to mixed-use apartment and retail space. A larger, multi-screen complex was later built north of Tanforan, but it has been replaced by an even larger complex, Century at Tanforan, in the remodeled shopping center.
In 1939, the War Department created the Golden Gate National Cemetery in San Bruno as space was starting to run out for veterans to be buried at the Presidio of San Francisco. In 1942, after the start of World War II, the local racetrack became the Tanforan Assembly Center, a temporary detention site for Japanese Americans evicted from the West Coast under Executive Order 9066.

Following World War II, there was continued growth and new subdivisions were built in Mills Park, Rollingwood, and Crestmoor. In 1947, the Bayshore Freeway (U.S. Route 101) was opened from South San Francisco to Redwood City and included an interchange at San Bruno.

Prior to 1950, San Bruno&#x27;s high school students attended San Mateo High School (opened in 1902) and then Burlingame High School (opened in 1923), traveling to and from school on the streetcars that ran next to the Southern Pacific railroad. Finally, on September 11, 1950, Capuchino High School opened in San Bruno. After years of using Green Hall as a multi-purpose building, the city dedicated a library and city hall in 1954. That same year saw the dedication of the current central terminal at the airport, part of a major expansion program. A central fire station was later built next to the city hall; an additional station was built in Crestmoor.

Actress and businesswoman Suzanne Somers was born in San Bruno in 1946. She attended local schools and graduated from Capuchino High School in June 1964.

In 1953, San Bruno annexed the adjoining unincorporated community of Lomita Park, bounded by San Felipe Avenue, El Camino Real, San Juan Avenue, and the railroad tracks. Until the annexation, Lomita Park had its own Southern Pacific train station and some community services.

Parkside Intermediate School was opened in 1954, followed by additional elementary schools: Rollingwood, Crestmoor, John Muir, and Carl Sandburg. A second intermediate school, Engvall, was built in Crestmoor Canyon, only to be closed, along with North Brae and Sandburg, when enrollment fell. These were all part of the San Bruno Park School District. Students in northwestern San Bruno were included in the Laguna Salada district. Highlands Christian School, a private school, is also located in San Bruno. Founded in 1966, Highlands Christian School is an interdenominational school, and offers preschool through college preparatory school instruction.

San Bruno considered new annexations in the mid-1950s that would have extended the city limits to the Pacific Ocean. The unincorporated communities west of San Bruno were against annexation, and collectively incorporated as the city of Pacifica in 1957.

On March 22, 1957, a magnitude 5.7 earthquake was centered in the area of the city. It inflicted minor damage throughout the city.

Eitel-McCullough operated a large manufacturing plant in San Bruno for many years. William Eitel and Jack McCullogh formed the company in 1934. It specialized in the manufacture of power grid tubes. Known as Eimac, the company also made vacuum tubes used in communication equipment, as well as other products for military and commercial applications. Due to its work on broadcast transmission parts, Eimac operated an FM radio station, KSBR, which transmitted on 100.5 megahertz. The station began operations in 1947 and, that same year, was one of only two in the nation to test Rangertone tape recorders. (The other station was WASH-FM in Washington, D.C.) The recorders were based on the German Magnetophon. In need of more space, the company moved to San Carlos in 1959. Eimac&#x27;s San Carlos plant was dedicated on April 16, 1959. In 1965, Eimac merged with Varian Associates and became known as the Eimac Division. In 1995, Leonard Green &amp; Partners purchased the entire Electron Devices Business from Varian and formed Communications &amp; Power Industries.
Crestmoor High School opened in September 1962, but was closed in June 1980 due to a decline in school enrollment. The city has a two-year community college, Skyline College.

A major landmark in San Bruno for many years was Tanforan Racetrack, which opened in 1899. Such famous racehorses as Seabiscuit and Citation raced there. Famed Hollywood director Frank Capra filmed scenes for two of his films, &quot;Broadway Bill&quot; and &quot;Riding High&quot;, at the racetrack. For six months in 1942, it served as one of the main Bay Area centers for those forced into Japanese American internment, processing about 8,000 Japanese before they were sent out to larger facilities in the desert of Utah and Manzanar in Owens Valley. The track closed in 1964 and was about to be demolished when it was destroyed in a major fire on July 31, 1964. The Shops at Tanforan mall was later built on the site; surrounding city streets were named for some of the racehorses who appeared at Tanforan.

The city was the site of the crash of Flying Tiger Line Flight 282 on December 23, 1964.

During the late 1960s, the I-280 (Junipero Serra Freeway), followed by I-380, was built through San Bruno. The San Bruno Planning Commission (then chaired by Peter Weinberger, brother of Caspar Weinberger) reviewed and approved plans for two major shopping centers, Bayhill (located on the old U.S. Navy property between San Bruno Avenue and Sneath Lane) and Tanforan. With final approval from the San Bruno City Council, construction proceeded on these major retail developments. Prior to these developments, most of the city&#x27;s retail businesses were located on San Mateo Avenue and El Camino Real.

San Bruno is one of two cities in the Bay Area that manages its own cable TV and internet system.

The October 17, 1989, Loma Prieta earthquake (6.9 magnitude) caused some damage in the city. The U.S. Postal Service&#x27;s Western Regional headquarters, which was then the tallest building in San Bruno, had to be demolished due to severe structural damage. The site was rebuilt as part of an expansion of The Gap clothing company world headquarters campus. The building now houses the headquarters for Wal-Mart&#x27;s online retail services, Walmart.com, and is now the tallest building in the city.

=== 21st century ===
The San Bruno BART station opened in 2003, when the transit system was extended to Millbrae and the San Francisco International Airport.

====September 2010 explosion and fire====


On September 9, 2010, at about 6:15 p.m. PDT, a gas line ruptured leading to a fire that severely damaged a residential neighborhood. Eight people were killed, nearly 60 others were injured, 38 homes were destroyed and 123 additional homes were damaged. The resulting fire &quot;hot spots&quot; were easily detected using meteorological satellite images.

The explosion, which took place west of San Francisco International Airport (), was initially thought to have been a plane crash, but the FAA and airport officials confirmed no downed aircraft was reported.

During the days prior to the explosion, some residents reported a strong smell of natural gas in the area.

On September 10, a team from the National Transportation Safety Board began an investigation into the cause of the explosion.

On September 13, PG&amp;E agreed to set aside a $100 million fund to the victims of the explosion. This does not preclude residents from taking any further action against PG&amp;E. Parts of the exploded material were taken to Washington, D.C., a couple of days after the explosion for examination.

====YouTube headquarters====
In 2007, YouTube had moved its headquarters from San Mateo, California to San Bruno, on Cherry Avenue next to Interstate 380. The main building was initially built for Gap Inc. in 1997. It had been designed in 1994, has a green roof, and was built with energy efficient ventilation systems. Across more than six properties, YouTube has over 2,000 employees working in the city, and is San Bruno&#x27;s largest employer. On April 3, 2018, a shooting took place at the headquarters complex, leaving four wounded and the female shooter dead.

===Former Naval Facility San Bruno===
During World War II the United States Navy established a base on what was a dairy opened by Richard Sneath. There it operated a Classification Center and a Naval Advance Base Personnel Depot. After the war it continued operation, and became host to the consolidated Western Division of Naval Facilities, supporting the multiple navy bases that were operating in the greater San Francisco Bay Area. Due to the 1993 BRAC and its closure of neighboring bases although recommended for realignment, the Navy decided to close the facility, carrying through with its decision in October 1994.

The federal government retained part of the former Naval Facility. The Pacific Region (San Francisco) facility of the National Archives and Records Administration was established. One of the buildings became a Navy and Marine Corps Reserve Center, which hosts the Headquarters Company of the 23rd Marine Regiment, amongst other units. The rest of the facility was sold to a private developer who has since built multi-story apartment buildings on the former base. The area of the former U.S. Navy complex is bounded by San Bruno Avenue, El Camino Real, Sneath Lane, and I-280.

==Economy==

===Top employers===
According to San Bruno&#x27;s 2020 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report and the &quot;San Mateo Daily Journal&quot; the top employers in the city were:

== Transportation ==

=== Roads ===

Interstate 280, running concurrent with California State Route 1, passes through San Bruno, and Interstate 380, which is entirely located within the city, flanks the northern part of San Bruno and connects with U.S. Route 101. The town is bisected by California State Route 82.

=== Public transit ===

SamTrans operates bus public transport within San Mateo County, with several routes through San Bruno. Commuter rail to and from San Bruno is served by Caltrain, and Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) has its Red and Yellow lines serve San Bruno.

Both the San Bruno Caltrain and BART stations are very close to the Shops at Tanforan; the BART station is adjacent to both the shopping mall and an intermodal transfer station for samTrans, serving its primary line, ECR, which operates between Daly City and Palo Alto along El Camino Real.

<text>Route 55 is a freeway in the southern part of the U.S. state of New Jersey. Also known as the Veterans Memorial Highway, it runs from an intersection with Route 47 in Port Elizabeth north to an interchange with Route 42 in Gloucester County. The Route 55 freeway serves as a main road through Cumberland and Gloucester counties, serving Millville, Vineland, and Glassboro. It is used as a commuter route north to Philadelphia and, along with Route 47, as a route from the Delaware Valley to the Jersey Shore resorts in Cape May County. Route 55 has a posted speed limit of for most of its length.

What is now Route 55 was originally proposed in the 1950s as a toll road called the Cape May Expressway that was to run from the Walt Whitman Bridge to Cape May. In 1962, the New Jersey Expressway Authority was created to build the Cape May Expressway and the Atlantic City Expressway. However, by 1965, the road to Cape May was turned over to the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) and designated as Route 55, which was to run from Westville to Cape May Court House. The first portion of the route opened around Millville in 1969 while the section bypassing Vineland was completed in the 1970s. Route 55 was completed north to Deptford in 1989.

Meanwhile, the portion between Route 47 in Port Elizabeth and the Garden State Parkway in Middle Township was canceled in 1975 due to the impact the highway would have on the surrounding environment.

==Route description==

===Cumberland and Salem counties===

Route 55 begins at a signalized intersection with Route 47 in the Port Elizabeth section of Maurice River Township, Cumberland County, heading to the north as a two-lane freeway through wooded areas. At the southern terminus, the road continues south as part of Route 47. A short distance after beginning, the road becomes a four-lane freeway and comes to a southbound exit and northbound entrance with Schooner Landing Road. Past this interchange, Route 55 enters Millville and crosses over the Manantico Creek as it heads into built-up areas. The freeway continues north to an interchange with Route 49.

Past the Route 49 interchange, Route 55 continues through Millville, passing over County Route 552 Spur (CR 552 Spur). The route passes to the east of WheatonArts, which is also home to the Creative Glass Center of America, before turning northwest and crossing into Vineland, where it interchanges with CR 555.

The freeway turns to the west past the CR 555 interchange and crosses over Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Vineland Secondary railroad line before entering Millville again. At this point, the route comes to a modified cloverleaf interchange with Route 47 adjacent to the Cumberland Mall. From Route 47, the freeway enters forested areas again and makes a turn to the north, crossing back into Vineland. In Vineland, it interchanges with CR 552 near Inspira Medical Center Vineland. This exit also serves the Rowan College of South Jersey Cumberland Campus to the east.

Route 55 continues between rural areas near the Maurice River to the west and development to the east, coming to a cloverleaf interchange with Route 56. Past this interchange, the route passes over a Winchester and Western Railroad line before crossing over CR 540. Farther north, a modified cloverleaf interchange serves CR 674 (Garden Road), which provides access to the northern part of Vineland. Past the Garden Road interchange, Route 55 continues through farmland and woodland, passing to the east of Rudys Airport. The freeway crosses Scotland Run and briefly runs through Pittsgrove Township in Salem County.

===Gloucester County===
Route 55 continues northwest into Franklin Township, Gloucester County, and reaches a cloverleaf interchange with U.S. Route 40 (US 40). Past this interchange, the freeway heads north, crossing over CR 538. Route 55 comes to a diamond interchange with Little Mill Road before entering Clayton and turning to the west. A short distance later, Route 55 continues into Elk Township and comes to an interchange with CR 553.

The route continues north into Glassboro, where it has an interchange with CR 641. Past this interchange, Route 55 crosses into Harrison Township and meets US 322 and CR 536 at a cloverleaf interchange near Inspira Medical Center Mullica Hill. US 322 heads east into Glassboro and serves Rowan University.

Past the US 322 interchange, the freeway continues through agricultural areas and enters Mantua Township, where it turns northeast and crosses under CR 553 Alternate. Route 55 passes under Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Vineland Secondary railroad line before intersecting CR 553 again at a modified cloverleaf interchange. This interchange provides access to The Broadway Theatre of Pitman.

Past CR 553, the route turns north again and passes near more suburban surroundings, briefly entering Washington Township before crossing into Deptford Township. In Deptford Township, Route 55 comes to a cloverleaf interchange with Route 47. Northbound Route 47 heads toward the Rowan College of South Jersey Gloucester Campus in Sewell. It crosses CR 534 before coming to a trumpet interchange with Deptford Center Road that provides access to CR 621 and the Deptford Mall. Past this interchange, Route 55 passes under CR 544 and CR 621 before merging onto Route 42 and coming to an end.

==History==

Following the completion of the Walt Whitman Bridge in the 1950s, two controlled-access toll roads were proposed to connect the bridge to Atlantic City and to Cape May. In 1962, the New Jersey Expressway Authority Act was signed into law. This act created the New Jersey Expressway Authority, which was to manage both the Atlantic City and Cape May expressways.

While the Atlantic City Expressway was completed by the authority in 1965, the Cape May Expressway was turned over to the state about this time. The Cape May Expressway was designated Route 55 and legislated to run from US 130 in Westville to US 9 near Cape May Court House. This proposed freeway was projected to cost $90 million (equivalent to $ in 2025) and be completed in 1975.

In 1969, the first segment of Route 55 opened between Maurice River Township and the Vineland-Millville border, connecting to Route 47 at both ends. In the 1970s, the planned northern terminus of Route 55 was moved to Route 42 in Deptford. The portion of Route 55 between Route 47 in Millville and US 40 in Franklin Township was completed in the mid-1970s while the portion between US 40 and Route 42 was completed in October 1989. The Route 55 freeway has been instrumental in bringing economic development to southern New Jersey. The most common use of the highway is as a commuting route northward to Philadelphia. Following its completion, residential development in the southern part of Gloucester County has increased.

While the freeway was under construction in 1983, it was discovered that it ran through Native American burial grounds in Deptford. This revelation led to unsuccessful lawsuits to cease construction of the route. After the lawsuits, a couple of incidents happened to construction workers, including a construction worker being run over by an asphalt truck, another being blown off a bridge by strong winds, and a van carrying five construction workers randomly erupting into flames.
Meanwhile, the portion of freeway south of Route 47 in Maurice River Township was not yet built. In 1972, NJDOT wanted to provide adequate access to the Cape May Peninsula by extending the freeway southeast from the current terminus to the Garden State Parkway in Middle Township. NJDOT conducted an environmental study on this proposal in 1975. The route was projected to cost $155 million (equivalent to $ in 2025) and be finished by 1995. Plans resurfaced for a southern extension in 1993 when a feasibility study was conducted to see if the extension of Route 55 could be built. This study, which estimated the extension would cost between $423 million and $483 million (equivalent to $ and $ in 2025), concluded that the road should not be built because it crossed too many wetlands.

The Route 55 freeway, like many other highways in New Jersey, once had solar-powered emergency call boxes every mile (about 1.6 km); the use of the call boxes became limited due to the increasing popularity of cell phones. To save on maintenance costs, NJDOT removed these call boxes in 2005.

Despite the fact that the southern extension was held up for decades, it was revisited due to the disturbing images of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in 2005 in the Gulf states. Route 55 could have been extended in order to provide a proper evacuation route for Cape May Peninsula and surrounding area. In addition, traffic jams along Route 47 during the summer also led to a possible revival of the proposal. There were efforts and studies to consider finishing the remaining of the missing freeway.

In 2009, State Senator Jeff Van Drew introduced a plan for an extension of Route 55 into Cape May County where the South Jersey Transportation Authority would build the road. In order to reduce the impact on the environment, the freeway would have been elevated. The extension of Route 55 would have been tolled. This effort followed two years of failed attempts for a feasibility study to relieve traffic on Route 47.

However, all of these efforts faced considerable environmental opposition, which has been successful in blocking these plans, which were estimated to cost as much as $2 billion.

==Public transportation==
In 1975, the Delaware River Port Authority (DRPA) proposed that a Port Authority Transit Corporation (PATCO) rail line be added along the median of Route 55 between Deptford and Glassboro; however, plans were canceled. In the 2000s, another proposal resurfaced to add a PATCO line along the Route 55 corridor. The alternative called for park and ride lots to be constructed along the Route 55 corridor, providing access to the line. Phase I would have run to Glassboro (Rowan University) and Phase II would have extended down to the Millville area and service the Cumberland Mall area.

New Jersey Governor Jon S. Corzine and the DRPA announced a comprehensive transportation plan for South Jersey on May 12, 2009. This plan would introduce express bus service along the Route 55 freeway and the adjacent Route 42 freeway. It would also include a diesel light rail line called the Glassboro–Camden Line between Camden and Glassboro via Woodbury over an existing railroad right-of-way (as opposed to the expanded PATCO line via Route 55), improvements to NJ Transit&#x27;s Atlantic City Line, and enhanced connections to the Atlantic City International Airport.

<text>San Carlos (Spanish for &quot;St. Charles&quot;) is a city in San Mateo County, California, United States. The population is 30,722 per the 2020 census.

==History==
===Native Americans===

Prior to the Spanish arrival in 1769, the land of San Carlos was occupied by a group of Native Americans who called themselves the Lamchins. While they considered themselves to have a separate identity from other local tribes, modern scholars consider them to be a part of the Ohlone or Costanoan tribes that inhabited the Bay Area.

The Lamchins referred to the area of their primary residenceprobably on the north bank of Pulgas creekas &quot;Cachanihtac&quot;, which included their word for vermin. When the Spanish arrived, they translated this as &quot;the fleas&quot;, or &quot;las Pulgas&quot;, giving many places and roads their modern names.

The Native American life was one of traditional hunting and gathering. There was plentiful game and fowl available, and fish could be caught in the San Francisco Bay. There were also grasses, plants and oak trees (for acorns), and archaeological finds of mortars and pestles indicate that these source were processed for food. No doubt they also participated in the regional trading networks for goods that could not be gathered or grown locally.

The Lamchin permanent village is thought to have been between the modern streets of Alameda de las Pulgas and Cordilleras Avenue, near San Carlos Avenue.

===Spanish colonial era===

In 1769, Gaspar de Portolá was the first westerner to reach the San Francisco Bay. While early historians placed his approach to the Bay from the Pacific Ocean as coming over the San Carlos hills, present researchers believe this &quot;discovery&quot; actually occurred in present-day Belmont.

The Spanish, with overwhelming military and economic advantages over the native population, quickly dominated the Bay Area. Initially, the missionaries invited local people to join them at Mission San Francisco de Asís (&quot;Mission Dolores&quot;) and convert to Christianity. Facing the end of their way of life, the local population had little choice but to seek assistance from the missions and convert to Christianity. Traditional trade routes and alliances fell apart. The Lamchin were one of the first local peoples to move to the mission. The first Lamchin were baptized at the mission in 1777 and last 1794. A total of 139 Lamchin people appear in the mission&#x27;s baptismal records.

Afterward, the land was deeded in large &quot;ranchos&quot;, or ranches, to prominent and wealthy Spaniards, with no concern for the native populations that lived on them. The new ranch owners raised cattle on the lands, displacing the native game populations and disrupting the food supply of the indigenous population. As well, the Spanish strongly discouraged the Native Americans from their periodic controlled burns, which helped maintain the grasslands.

The land now occupied by the city of San Carlos was deeded as a single large rancho to Don José Darío Argüello. He and his family did not live there, but rather raised cattle and crops for money on &quot;Rancho Cachinetac&quot; (a Spanish derivation of &quot;Cachanihtac&quot;). José&#x27;s son Luis Argüello was the first California-born governor of the state, and after his death in 1830 the remaining family moved to the ranch, now known as Rancho de las Pulgas. The family abode was located at the present-day intersection of Magnolia and Cedar streets.

===Late 19th century===

While the California Gold Rush of 1849 found no gold nearby, disappointed Sierra Nevada prospectors made their way to the region, bringing the first non-Spanish western settlers. The Argüello family retained deed to their ranch through the transfer of governments to the United States, and, in the 1850s, began selling parcels of it through their agent S. M. Mezes.

While the port of Redwood City, to the south, and the town of Belmont, to the north, both grew quickly in the late 19th century, San Carlos&#x27; growth was much slower. Major portions were purchased by the Brittan Family, the Hull Family, the Ralston family and Timothy Guy Phelps.
Timothy Phelps, a wealthy politician, made an early attempt to further develop the San Carlos area. He paid for significant improvements such as sewer lines and street grading, and began to promote lot sales in what he immodestly called &quot;The Town of Phelps&quot;.

Phelps&#x27; sales were largely unsuccessful, and he eventually sold much of his land to Nicholas T. Smith&#x27;s San Carlos Land Development Company. Other developers were not overly fond of Phelps&#x27; eponymous efforts, and decided to rename the town. Some maps are existent referring to the area as &quot;Lomitas&quot; (&quot;little hills&quot; in Spanish) but eventually due to historical legend, the name &quot;San Carlos&quot; was chosen. As noted previously, it was believed that Portolá had first seen the San Francisco Bay on November 4 from the San Carlos hills. November 4 is the feast day of St. Charles. As well, the Spanish king at the time was Carlos III, and the first ship to sail into San Francisco bay was the &quot;San Carlos&quot;.

The newly named regionnot yet incorporatedreceived a boost with the construction of the Peninsula Railroad Corridor in 1863, and the addition, of a station at San Carlos in 1888.

Growth remained slow through the turn of the 20th century, with most residents enjoying the short 35-minute train ride to San Francisco while living in a rural setting. The Hull family operated a dairy located at the modern intersection of Hull and Laurel. Many of the other residents which were not involved in agriculture were wealthy business and professional men who worked with the railroad or in San Francisco.

Despite the efforts of the developers, growth was very slow in this period, and San Carlos ended the 19th century with fewer than one hundred houses and families.

===1900–1941===
The turn of the 20th century saw the layout of the initial town streets. While &quot;Old County Road&quot; east of the railroad track had been in use as a stage line since at least 1850, the present-day layout west of the railroad track was constructed in the first years of 1900. Cedar, Elm, Laurel, Magnolia, Maple (renamed El Camino Real) and Walnut were put down in this time.

Growth remained slow through the first fifteen years of the new century, but in 1918 the town had grown enough to build a school at 600 Elm Street. One year previously Frederick Drake (&quot;The Father of San Carlos&quot;) had purchased of real estate in San Carlos in foreclosure, and began marketing it. Growth came quickly, and the early 1920s saw Drake build an office at the southwest corner of Cypress (now San Carlos Ave) and El Camino Real, which is still existent, and is home to Drake&#x27;s Restaurant dedicated to Frederick Drake.
In the early 1920s, the cypresses along Cypress Ave. were removed, and the street widened and renamed San Carlos Ave. In 1923 the growing municipality founded a fire station, and in July 8, 1925 the founders voted to incorporate.

The Great Depression affected families in San Carlos, as it did everywhere, but growth continued, and population grew from approximately 600 at incorporation in 1925 to 5,000 in 1941.

In 1932, Charles Litton Sr. founded Litton Engineering Laboratories in San Carlos, revolutionizing vacuum tube production with his invention of the glass-blowing lathe. This innovation laid the groundwork for advancements in electronics and communications, making the company a key precursor to Litton Industries in 1953.

While services such as stores increased in this period, by the beginning of World War II San Carlos was still known in the Bay Area as a rural community. Most of the land in the municipality was still used for agricultural purposes, and photographs of the time show a landscape with few houses separated by large fields.

===1941–1945===
====War Dogs====
During World War II, not long after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the American Kennel Club and a new group calling itself &quot;Dogs for Defense&quot; mobilized dog owners across the country to donate quality animals to the Quartermaster Corps. Dogs donated by a patriotic public to the Army saved the lives of a number of soldiers in combat.

In October 1942, the US Army and “Dogs for Defense” came to San Carlos. The 178-acre site, at the top of today&#x27;s Club and Crestview Drives, which was locally known as the H and H Ranch, was selected to become the US Army War Dog Reception and Training Center (also known as Western Remount Area Reception and Training Center). It was established between October 15, 1942, and November 7, 1942.

The first enlisted men for the army post were temporarily housed in the San Carlos Fire Station (located on Laurel Street between San Carlos Ave. and Holly St.) from December 15 to 28, 1942. Each dog handler was given four dogs to train, and at the end of the course, the trainer selected the best one and shipped out. Dogs were trained for sentry, attack, scout, and messenger roles, and later to detect mines. 1,200 dogs could be accommodated at any one time.

The first army dog platoon to go overseas in the Pacific was the 25th Quartermaster Corps War Dog Platoon, under the command of 1st Lt. Bruce D. Walker. When they left San Carlos, on May 11, 1944, none of the handlers knew what their final destination would be. They left via San Francisco aboard the Liberty ship SS &quot;John Isaacson&quot; for assignments in the Pacific Theatre.

The facility closed in October 1944, with approximately 4,500 dogs going through the facility during the war.

===1945 to the end of the 20th century===

In 1944, Dalmo Victor established the city&#x27;s first large electronics plant, followed soon after by Eitel McCullough, Varian Associates (Later occupied by Tesla Motors and currently by Devil&#x27;s Canyon Brewing Company), and Lenkurt Electric Company.

Establishment of these two firms was a factor in the quadrupling of San Carlos population in the decade after 1940. In 1950, when the population was 14,371, the city boasted a total of 89 industries: wholesalers, manufacturers and distributors, producing a variety of commodities from electronics to cosmetic. By 1958, the electronic industry comprised a substantial segment of the city&#x27;s industrial area.

In the late 1940s when Bayshore was a two-lane road, the San Carlos Airport was moved from its former location between Brittan and San Carlos Avenues to its present site. The airport was bought by the county from Cal West Yacht Harbor in 1964 for $990,000.

In 2022, the city received national attention after a woman was beheaded with a sword.

In 2025, San Carlos is set to celebrate its Centennial Year.

Within the city, there are several elementary schools (grades K–3), two upper elementary schools (grades 4–5), and two middle schools (grades 6–8). Since the 1982 closure of San Carlos High School, local students have attended Sequoia High School in Redwood City and Carlmont High School in Belmont.

In 1996, Vice President Al Gore came to speak at Arundel Elementary School in regards to Net Day 1996. Former president Bill Clinton came to Charter Learning Center in 1997 to recognize the site as the second charter school in the nation.

* White Oaks

====Upper elementary schools====

====Middle schools====
* Central Middle School
* Tierra Linda Middle School
* Charter Learning Center (Kindergarten through 8th grade)

====High schools====
Up until 1982 San Carlos had its own public high school, San Carlos High School. It was closed due to a decline in student enrollment from an overall aging of San Carlos residents, with the students of San Carlos middle schools divided up among the nearby Carlmont High School in Belmont and Sequoia High School in Redwood City. The playing fields were kept and converted into Highlands Park, which now hosts many local youth sporting groups, while the school was replaced with new housing. By the late 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century, city demographics changed again to a new generation of younger families with children, with the concurrent growth in student populations a new challenge for local schools.

In December 2014, the Sequoia Union High School District proposed development of a small high school in east San Carlos. Due to community opposition, the District instead selected a location in Menlo Park, which opened in 2019 as TIDE Academy.

San Carlos is served by both bus and rail provided by SamTrans and Caltrain, respectively; both agencies are headquartered in downtown San Carlos. In 2002, the city began experimenting with a free shuttle bus service named SCOOT, short for San Carlos Optimum Operational Transit, to help with transportation difficulties for those living in the hills of the town, and especially to make up for a lack of school buses. However, voters rejected a parcel tax that placed 100% of the financial burden on property owners and the SCOOT program was dismantled on June 17, 2005.

<text>San Mateo ( ) is the most populous city in San Mateo County, California, United States, on the San Francisco Peninsula. About south of San Francisco, the city borders Burlingame to the north, Hillsborough to the west, San Francisco Bay and Foster City to the east and Belmont to the south. The population was 105,661 at the 2020 census. Some of the biggest economic drivers for the city include technology, health care and education.

==History==
The earliest known settlers of the Bay Area were the Ramaytush people, since at least 10000 BC.

===Spanish era===
In 1789, the Spanish missionaries had named a Native American village along Laurel Creek as &quot;Los Laureles&quot; or the Laurels (Mission Dolores, 1789). At the time of Mexican Independence, 30 native Californians were at San Mateo, most likely from the Salson tribelet.

=== Mexican era ===
Captain Frederick William Beechey in 1827 traveling with the hills on their right, known in that part as the Sierra del Sur, began to approach the road, which passing over a small eminence, opened out upon &quot;a wide country of meadow land, with clusters of fine oak free from underwood... It strongly resembled a nobleman&#x27;s park: herds of cattle and horses were grazing upon the rich pasture, and numerous fallow‑deer, startled at the approach of strangers, bounded off to seek protection among the hills... This spot is named San Matheo, and belongs to the mission of San Francisco.&quot;

The city of San Mateo was documented by Spanish colonists as part of the Rancho de las Pulgas and the Rancho San Mateo; the earliest history is held in the archives of Mission Dolores. Rancho San Mateo was granted in May 1846 from Pío Pico to his secretary, Cayetano Arenas; this tract included approximately half of present-day San Mateo, all of Burlingame and Hillsborough, and the Spring Valley lakes (now Crystal Springs Reservoir and San Andreas Lake). William Davis Merry Howard purchased Rancho San Mateo from Arenas in 1846 for and spent an equal sum erecting a fence around the property.

=== Post-Conquest era ===
In the 1850s, following the American Conquest of California, many San Franciscans began building summer homes in the mid-Peninsula, because of the milder climate. The area that is now the city of San Mateo was owned by a few large landowners, including Howard, whose Rancho San Mateo occupied in 1853 north of San Mateo Creek, pushing most of this early settlement into adjacent Hillsborough, Burlingame, and Belmont; other significant landowners in the area included John Parrott, who purchased in 1860 south of the creek and southwest of El Camino Real and Alvinza Hayward, who owned the land south of the creek and east of El Camino. Much of the remaining land south of these areas was used for agriculture until the early 1900s; the owners included John Whipple, who had a large horse farm south of Parrott&#x27;s land, Lemuel Murray, J.S. Colegrove, and David McClellan.

In 1858, Sun Water Station, a stage station of the Butterfield Overland Mail route, was established in San Mateo. It was from both Clarks Station (to the north) in what is now San Bruno and the next station south at Redwood City.

Several historically important mansions and buildings were constructed in San Mateo around this time. A.P. Giannini, founder of the Bank of Italy (which later became the Bank of America), lived here most of his life. His mansion, Seven Oaks, is listed in the National Register of Historic Places (No. 99001181). Located at 20 El Cerrito Avenue, it has been deteriorating as it has not been preserved or occupied for years.

The Howard Estate was built in 1859 on the hill accessed by Crystal Springs Road; the building, named &quot;El Cerrito&quot;, eventually was moved to Hillsborough and served as its Town Hall starting from in 1910, but it has since been demolished. The Parrott Estate was erected in 1860 in the same area, giving rise to two conflicting names for the hill, Howard Hill and Parrot Hill. After use of the automobile changed traffic patterns, neither historic name was commonly applied to that hill. Once San Mateo was incorporated on September 4, 1894, its first mayor was Captain A.H. Payson, a son-in-law of Parrott.

When the San Francisco and San Jose Railroad was under construction during the 1860s, one of its corporate directors, Charles Polhemus, purchased the land south of the creek, now the site of downtown San Mateo, and began laying out the town; the first town plat was laid out in 1862. Polhemus settled on the land which is now Central Park and one of the succeeding owners, William Kohl, built the iron and stone fence which still encloses the park.

The Borel Estate was developed near Borel Creek in 1874 by Antoine Borel. It has been redeveloped since the late 20th century for use as modern offices and shops. The property is managed and owned by Borel Place Associates and the Borel Estate Company.

Hayward Park, the 1880 American Queen Anne-style residence of Alvinza Hayward (often said to be &quot;California&#x27;s first millionaire&quot; from his silver and banking fortunes), was built on an estate in San Mateo which included a deer park and racetrack, roughly bounded by present-day El Camino Real (on the west), 9th Avenue (on the north), B Street (on the east) and 16th Avenue (on the south). A smaller portion of the property and the mansion, was converted into The Peninsula Hotel in 1908, following Hayward&#x27;s death in 1904. The hotel burned down in a spectacular fire on June 25, 1920.

William H. Howard, eldest son of W.D.M. Howard, is credited with the first subdivisions in the region, resulting in what is now the Western Addition of San Mateo in 1888; he followed up by creating the first subdivision of Burlingame and Highland Park in San Mateo.

=== 20th century ===
In 1893, Pedro Evencio had been called the last of the Ramaytush Native American of San Mateo. Although Joseph (José) Evencio (the younger) was reported to be his descendant living at Coyote Point until World War II, &quot;Indian Joe&quot;, (Joe Mestes) was the American Indian who was actually hired by the Howard family to oversee their land holding at Coyote Point. He is reported to have had a tribal affiliation in Montana. His final whereabouts were reported to be a care facility in Oakland after he had been removed from Coyote Point when a Merchant Marine Academy was established there.
In the early 20th century, Japanese immigrants came to San Mateo to work in the salt ponds and flower industry. Although Japanese-Americans only account for 2.2% of the population today, they continue to be a major cultural influence and a draw for the rest of the region. The Eugene J. De Sabla Japanese Teahouse and Garden was established in 1894 at 70 De Sabla Road, designed by Makoto Hagiwara, designer of the Japanese garden in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. He arranged for Japanese artisans to be brought to the United States primarily for its teahouse construction.

The parcel was purchased in 1988 by San Francisco businessman Achille Paladini and wife Joan, who have restored it. The garden features hundreds of varieties of plants and several rare trees. A large koi pond surrounds an island. The property was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.
In December 1967, Sgt. Joe Artavia, then serving in Vietnam with Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division wrote to his sister, Linda Giese, who was a resident of San Carlos working in San Mateo, asking if San Mateo or San Francisco could adopt the company, saying that it would bring &quot;the morale of the guys up as high as the clouds&quot;. San Mateo passed a resolution on March 4, 1968, officially adopting Alpha Company and letters and gifts began arriving from the citizens of San Mateo. Joe would be killed in action on March 24, 1968, less than three weeks after the resolution. Linda would travel to Vietnam to meet with the men of Alpha Company for Christmas in 1968 and deliver personalized medallions from the City of San Mateo. In 1972, San Mateo requested and received permission to have Alpha Company visit the city when they left Vietnam, later holding a parade in January 1972, believed to be the only parade honoring the military during the Vietnam War. In 1988, Joseph Brazan wrote a screenplay entitled &quot;A Dove Among Eagles&quot; chronicling the adoption of Alpha Company by San Mateo and the real-life romance between Linda and Artavia&#x27;s commander, Lt. Stephen Patterson. The city expanded its support to the entire 1st Battalion in 1991, when they were deployed to Kuwait under Operation Desert Storm.

=== 21st century ===

Bay Meadows horse-racing track was torn down in 2008.

In the November 2022 election, Councilmember Diane Papan was elected to the California State Assembly, creating a vacancy on the five-person city council. At the December 5, 2022, council reorganization meeting, two of the remaining four councilmembers chose not to follow the standard precedent of selecting a new mayor, which normally rotates to the councilmember who has been in office the longest. With the vote split at 2–2, the city went a week without a mayor. After a second meeting that also ended without a decision, Amourence Lee was selected as the mayor at the third meeting on December 12.
==Geography==
San Mateo is located at (37.554286, −122.313044). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , comprising 23.63%, are covered by water.

The best-known natural area is Coyote Point Park, a rock outcropped peninsula that juts out into the San Francisco Bay. The early Spanish navigators named it &quot;la punta de San Mateo.&quot; Crews of American cargo ships carrying grain in the bay renamed it &quot;Big Coyote&quot;. Sailors had a penchant for naming promontories at the edge of San Francisco Bay after the coyote; across the bay in Fremont are the Coyote Hills, part of Coyote Hills Regional Park. By the 1890s, the shore area was developed as a popular beach called San Mateo Beach. In 1842, the Spanish had named it &quot;playa de San Mateo&quot;. Today, Coyote Point is home to CuriOdyssey, formerly known as the Coyote Point Museum, a major natural history museum and wildlife center in the state. The animal care facility for the Peninsula Humane Society is also situated at Coyote Point, where the adoption facility is located in Burlingame.

The variety of natural habitats includes mixed oak woodland, riparian zones, and bayland marshes. One endangered species, the California clapper rail, was sighted feeding on mudflats by the Third Avenue bridge in San Mateo. The marsh areas are also likely habitat for the endangered salt marsh harvest mouse, which inhabits the middle and high zones of salt and brackish marshes, as well as for the endangered marsh plant, Point Reyes bird&#x27;s beak.

Sugarloaf Mountain, whose name has been documented in 1870, is a prominent landform between the forks of Laurel Creek. In the late 20th century, this mixed oak woodland and chaparral habitat was a site of controversy related to proposals to develop a portion of the mountain for residential use. It has been preserved for use as park and open space area, and is home to the endangered mission blue butterfly.

Sawyer Camp Trail, located on the western edge of San Mateo along the Crystal Springs Reservoir, is another popular destination for joggers, pedestrians, and bikers. This roughly trail begins in San Mateo and stretches north toward Hillsborough and San Bruno, parallel to the 280 freeway.

===Neighborhoods===
In general, San Mateo&#x27;s downtown core and the neighborhoods east of El Camino Real are more populous and have a greater density than the neighborhoods to the west of El Camino Real, where there is a lower population density.

;Downtown
San Mateo has one of the larger, better-developed suburban downtowns in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is located roughly between Tilton Ave. to the northwest, 9th Ave. to the southeast, Delaware St. to the northeast and El Camino Real to the southwest. The downtown core contains over 800 shops and restaurants, many located in historic buildings from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The non-profit Downtown San Mateo Association (DSMA) works on behalf of downtown businesses to promote them and improve the downtown area.

Central Park is considered to be San Mateo&#x27;s signature park with a baseball field, tennis courts, sculptures, picnic areas, playground, Japanese tea garden, recreation center, miniature train, rose garden and the San Mateo Arboretum. The property was purchased by the city in 1922. A historically influential area for the Japanese-American community, the downtown is home to many Japanese restaurants and shops. A large, 12-screen movie theater complex is located off the Main Street alley between 2nd and 3rd Ave. The San Mateo Caltrain station is situated downtown. The area also contains many large and small multi-story office buildings, apartments, government buildings and Mills Medical Center.

Segments of South B Street between 1st and 3rd Ave. and the southbound lane between Baldwin and 1st Ave. were temporarily closed to vehicular traffic in 2020 to allow for expanded outdoor dining. The San Mateo City Council extended the temporary closure through the end of 2021 and voted in September 2021 to create a permanent pedestrian mall between 1st and 3rd Ave. The plan requires a fire lane in the center of the street for public safety vehicles and necessary garbage or delivery services. The city aims to conduct the project in two phases: First, by installing retractable bollards and updating traffic signals and signage, then by raising the level of the street to be flush with sidewalk and reimagining its landscaping.

;Bay Meadows
The Bay Meadows neighborhood is an mixed-use transit-oriented development on the site of the former Bay Meadows Racetrack, a horse racing venue that closed in 2008. The area includes hundreds of new residential units, office space, retail space and parks and a town square. Ground broke in 2012 and construction on various projects continues as of 2021.

;Hillsdale
Hillsdale Shopping Center is a mall in San Mateo County, featuring over 120 stores in the mall itself and surrounded by many big box stores. Tenants include anchors Nordstrom, Ethan Allen and Macy&#x27;s. The construction of a new food court and the outdoor North Block Plaza expanded the mall in 2019. New entertainment additions include luxury movie theater Cinépolis and a Pinstripes bowling alley off El Camino Real. The Hillsdale Caltrain station is located across El Camino.

==Climate==
San Mateo has a Mediterranean climate with warm, dry summers and mild, damp winters. The city is generally shielded from the Pacific Ocean by the Montara Mountain block of the Santa Cruz Mountains, but two gaps in the mountains (the San Bruno Gap, between Montara Mountain and San Bruno Mountain; and the Crystal Springs Gap, near where State Route 92 meets State Route 35, west of the College of San Mateo) can channel ocean weather, resulting in gusty afternoon winds that bring fog toward San Mateo in the late afternoon through early morning in the summer.

The National Weather Service maintained a cooperative weather station in San Mateo until 1978; records for the period show that January, the coolest month, had an average maximum of and an average minimum of , and September, the warmest month, had an average maximum of and an average minimum of .

The most precipitation in one month was of rainfall in December 1955 and the most precipitation in 24 hours was of rainfall on December 23, 1955. Based on comparison with the existing NWS office at San Francisco International Airport, San Mateo is generally a few degrees warmer in summer than the airport and a few degrees cooler in winter, while annual precipitation is almost the same at the airport and in San Mateo. In recent years, daily temperature reports for San Mateo from local weather observers have been published in the &quot;San Mateo Times&quot; and the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;.

==Public libraries==
The City of San Mateo operates one central (Main) and two branch (Hillsdale and Marina) libraries within the city; all three are part of the Peninsula Library System.

The newest Main Library building, at 55 West 3rd Avenue near Central Park in downtown, opened in 2006 after residents passed a $35 million bond measure; the remaining funds came from state ($20 M) and private sources ($10 M). It was designed by EHDD. Upon opening, the three-story, building earned numerous design awards and was LEED-certified NC Gold. Floor-to-ceiling windows provide abundant natural light. The technologically advanced building is modeled after a retail bookstore.

The first public library in San Mateo was organized in 1883, and a building named Library Hall was completed in 1885, sharing the structure with other municipal uses. The library moved to a dedicated Carnegie library building in 1907 at 129 2nd Avenue, the northwest corner with San Mateo Drive, one year after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake damaged Library Hall. The Hillsdale and Marina branches opened in 1957 and 1966, respectively. The Carnegie building was torn down in 1969 after a new library building designed by William Garwood was dedicated on December 15, 1968 at the present-day location on 3rd.
