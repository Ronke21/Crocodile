==History==
The Rio Linda/Elverta community is located on part of the Rancho Del Paso Mexican land grant of 1844. In 1910, a Fruit Land Company of Minneapolis acquired of the Grant and in 1912 the area was subdivided. Renamed Rio Linda in 1913, it was known as &quot;Dry Creek Station&quot;, a flag stop for the Northern Electric Railroad, renamed the Sacramento Northern Railway after joining the San Francisco–Sacramento system to improve service the Sacramento Valley. Two families settled in Rio Linda by 1912, three more arrived in 1913, and nine more in 1914. By 1918, approximately 50 families in the community, mostly of Scandinavian and German descent. By 1920, poultry farming had proved to be feasible in the area which was advertised throughout several Eastern states during the 1920s. The Sacramento Northern Railway stopped commuter services in 1940, redirecting focus to freight in the wake of World War II. An association was formed between Rio Linda and Elverta in 1942 as the area became more well known for its excellent poultry production. Steady growth throughout the second half of the 1900s aided by its proximity to the Sacramento metropolitan area and an urban exodus known as white flight from the early 1950s to the mid-1960s.

==History==
Established in 1850 by John W. Sharp, Walnut Grove is one of the earliest settlements along the Sacramento River. Sharp journeyed west from Ohio with his young family and chose the site of Walnut Grove because of the abundant walnut and oak forests in the area. The town quickly prospered as an agricultural center and riverboat stop (the forests were timbered for steamboat firewood). It was also a major shipping port by 1865 for agricultural produce and fish, with the Bartlett pear as its primary product. By 1870, it had become a thriving town full of small businesses (many owned by the Sharp family), a school, post office, and Union Guard Armory.

After Sharp&#x27;s death in 1880, the heirs sold a large portion of the estate to Agnes Brown and her son Alex. The Brown family subsequently became heavily involved in the commercial life of the community, operating a general store, hotel, and asparagus packing house, as well as the Bank of Alex Brown. Due to the demands for rich agricultural land over time, although the town has remained compact in size, it holds the distinction of being the only river town along the Sacramento River to occupy both the east and west riverbanks.

Ferry service operated for many years between parts of town on either side of the river until the first bridge was opened in 1916. The bridge, since replaced by a modern span, was the first cantilevered counterweight bascule drawbridge constructed west of the Mississippi River. It was officially opened by the Governor of California, who traveled with various dignitaries to Walnut Grove on the gubernatorial yacht.

As early as 1914, a large Japanese community lived in Walnut Grove, which they called &quot;Kawashimo&quot;. The &quot;Nichi-Bei Nenkan&quot; (&quot;Japanese American Yearbook&quot;) of 1914 includes a directory of 67 Japanese-owned businesses, including one tofu shop: Sakai Tofu-ya. There was still a tofu shop in town in 1975, according to &quot;The Book of Tofu&quot;.

The community was racially segregated up to the start of World War II. Only whites were allowed to own homes on the west side of the river. Even on the east side, the Asians separated into a Japanese section and a Chinese section. There were two elementary schools, a &quot;white&quot; school and Walnut Grove Oriental Elementary, until the Japanese were forcibly moved out of the area at the start of World War II. Then, the two elementary schools were combined. After elementary school, the students were bused to Courtland for high school, until that school became identified as an earthquake hazard.

The Chinese residents primarily immigrated from two different areas of the Guangdong Pearl River Delta region of China; immigrants from Zhongshan resided in Locke, while those from Taishan populated Walnut Grove. During the Sino-Japanese War in the 1930s, the Walnut Grove-Locke-Isleton area was a prime target for visiting Chinese government VIPs to raise funds for the Chinese government.

The principal activities in the Walnut Grove Chinese community were operating illegal gambling houses and Chinese restaurants. These services were primarily for migrant farm workers from the Philippines. &quot;Whites&quot; were not allowed to enter for fear they might be police authorities. Routine police raids were staged during election times to demonstrate the Sacramento County Sheriff&#x27;s &quot;fight against crime&quot;.

In the early 1930s, Walnut Grove was a thriving community until fire again consumed the Chinese section in the mid-1930s. In its glory days of the 1930s and early 1940s, a daily shuttle operated by the Ow family carried Chinese to and from San Francisco; it also accepted and executed orders for merchandise from San Francisco. The route started from Courtland with stops at Locke, Walnut Grove, and Isleton and returned nightly.

After World War II, gambling operations ceased. Members from the small Chinese community in Walnut Grove moved to the cities and many elder Filipinos returned to their homeland. The town now hosts both the and Walnut Grove Japanese-American Historic District.

Sugar beet harvesting was active up to the late 1940s. There were two leading areas where beets were unloaded from trucks into a hopper, then conveyed up a belt to fill Southern Pacific railroad cars for the trip north to Sacramento for processing. Asian women worked in fruit packing houses throughout the Delta area [Locke, Walnut Grove, Ryde, Isleton] while men worked in the fields.

In 1961, documentary photographer Pirkle Jones did a photo essay on Walnut Grove.

==Sites of interest==

===Towers===

Walnut Grove&#x27;s location has made it the site of a rare collection of very tall radio and television transmission towers. The first major tower here was the KXTV/KOVR/KCRA Tower built in 1962, which dominated the skyline for over twenty years with its 1,548-foot height. In 1985 the old tower was joined by taller structures. The guyed KXTV/KOVR Tower is, with a height of 2,048 feet, one of the tallest constructions in the world. Two other guyed towers of similar height are the 1,996-foot-high Channel 40 Tower (KTXL), and the 2,000-foot-high Hearst-Argyle Tower. Towers sited here at the natural corner of the California Central Valley have line of sight coverage of flat valley floor for over 60 miles (100 kilometers) to the north and to the south-southeast, and quite good coverage into the Sierra foothills and mountains across the valley to the northeast and east. However, these towers and their guy-wires are a significant hazard to aircraft, which can otherwise freely cross most of the Central Valley at 656 feet of altitude.

Delta Meadows State Recreation Area

Located along the Railroad Slough Levee, and accessed from the River Road between Walnut Grove and Locke, via a small gravel road just north-east of the Delta Cross Channel, a water diversion facility on the Sacramento River. Additionally, a docent program through Delta Natural History Association provides canoes with guides in the spring and fall, reserved through Brannan Island State Park.

===Walnut Grove Buddhist Church===
The Walnut Grove Buddhist Church in the Japanese district was founded in 1926 to serve the spiritual needs of the community, with over 100 members prior to WWII. It also served as a temporary hostel to house families who had lost their homes following their incarceration during the war.

Through the 80s and 90s, church membership fell as many of the older generation passed away, although many local residents as well as the children and grandchildren of the original members continue to support the church through the popular annual summer Bazaar and Obon, providing much needed income to the church coffers.

===Locke===
Chan Tin-San is commonly credited as the earliest resident of Locke, California. He was the first Chinese person to construct a building on the Locke brothers&#x27; property, where he realized the business potential of the Southern Pacific wharf and warehouse. After the October 1916 fire which destroyed the Walnut Grove Chinatown, a number of Chung-San District people moved to the area and Locke was officially established. Lee Bing, the leader of the group, financed nine of the buildings. Locke is one of the few towns in the United States built entirely by Chinese. It was built in 1915 and burned down twice. Locke was a bustling place with gambling houses, merchant stores and a movie house all owned by the Chinese. Locke today is much like it was many years ago. Most of the original buildings are still standing. The Southern Pacific wharf and warehouse was built in three stages, the first in 1906. It grew to over in length. During the harvest season a half dozen or more fruit packers would rent space in the warehouse, among them were Scobel &amp; Day, Simons &amp; French, Earl Fruit Company, and the California Packing Corporation. The rail spur served the warehouse and connected with the Walnut Grove Branch line. The warehouse operated two freight elevators which raised produce from the decks of the riverboats. The warehouse is now used to store and launch pleasure boats.

<doc id="107979" wikidata="Q936919" url="?curid=107979" title="Hollister, California">
<text>Hollister is a city in and the county seat of San Benito County, located in the Central Coast region of California, United States. With a 2020 United States census population of 41,678, Hollister is one of the most populous cities in the Monterey Bay Area and a member of the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments. The city is an agricultural town known primarily for its local Blenheim apricots, olive oil, vineyards, pomegranates, and chocolate.

==History==
The area of modern-day Hollister was historically inhabited by the Mutsun band of the Ohlone Indians. With the construction of Mission San Juan Bautista in 1797, the Ohlone went into the California mission system.

The town of Hollister was founded on November 19, 1868, by William Welles Hollister on the grounds of the former Mexican land-grant Rancho San Justo. At the time, Hollister was located within Monterey County, until San Benito County was formed by the California Legislature in 1874 from portions of Monterey, Merced, and Santa Cruz counties.

The city is intermittently the site of an annual motorcycle rally around July Fourth. The riot at the original 1947 event was the basis for the 1953 film &quot;The Wild One&quot;. The rally was revived in 1997 as the Hollister Independence Rally.

In 2005, the Hollister City Council discontinued their contract with the event organizers, the Hollister Independence Rally Committee, due to financial and public safety concerns. The event was canceled in 2006 due to lack of funding for security, but returned in 2007 and 2008. The format of the rally in 2007 differed markedly from previous rallies, with vendors on San Benito Street instead of motorcycles. The bikes were forced to park on side streets and a strict downtown curfew was imposed, with the entire area being locked up at 9:00 pm. This event was popular with bikers and some local establishments profited, but the city footed the bill for much of the expenses and was left liable when organizers filed bankruptcy.

The 2009–2012 rallies were canceled, but the annual rally was reinstated in 2013, and was expected to be profitable for the town. Following a biker gang shooting at the 2014 rally, Hollister mandated that bars must stop selling alcohol after midnight during the 2015 rally. The 2015 rally unexpectedly left the city with a $92,000 loss following a dispute with the promoter. In 2016, the city hired its third promoter in four years; turnout for the 2016 rally was expected to be around 40,000. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; characterized the 2017 rally crowd as &quot;retired, friendly, weather-worn and excruciatingly law abiding&quot;, and estimated the motorcycle attendance around 10,000. The 2018 rally was cancelled due to loss of a major sponsor and concerns about the cost of workers compensation liability. However, 2018 and 2019 both saw non-city-sanctioned &quot;rebel rallies&quot;. The 2020 rally was cancelled due to &quot;shelter in place&quot; policies related to the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic. A non-city-sanctioned rally occurred in 2021. The 2021 turnout was smaller than at the official rallies of the mid-2010s. In 2022 the city council declined to sponsor a rally amid a shortage of law enforcement officers.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Hollister has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;) that has warmer summers than the Monterey–Salinas area but is cooler than many other inland cities in the Central Valley. Daytime temperatures of around are typical between June and October, but heat extremes can be much more severe.

===Geology===
Hollister is well known among geologists because it represents one of the best examples of aseismic creep anywhere in the world. The Calaveras Fault (a branch of the San Andreas Fault system) bisects the city north and south, roughly along Locust Ave. and Powell St. The streets running east–west across the fault have significant visible offsets. The fault runs directly under several houses. Even though they are visibly contorted, the houses are still habitable as the owners have reinforced them to withstand the dislocation of their foundations.

Although there was extensive damage in the town after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, and the governor of California came to visit, this was due to a slip of the San Andreas Fault proper and was not related to the aseismic creep on the Calaveras Fault. The San Andreas Fault (proper) (not to be confused with the Calaveras Fault) runs, at its closest, through San Juan Bautista to the west and through the Hollister Hills State Vehicular Recreation Area to the south.

Hollister is one of at least three California towns to claim the title of &quot;Earthquake Capital of the World,&quot; the other two being Coalinga and Parkfield.

Hollister sits on the western foothills of the Diablo Range.

Around early 2014, Hollister hired four additional police officers to battle a perceived increase in methamphetamine use. In addition, the early 2010s saw an increase in heroin use among young adults, possibly related to tighter regulation of prescription drugs such as Oxycontin which have similar effects to heroin. Furthermore, youth violence spiked around 2013 and 2014.

===Confusion with Hollister Co.===
Hollister Co. is an American lifestyle brand by Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. that projects a Southern California image. According to Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, the name Hollister was pulled out of thin air. The city of Hollister is not affiliated with Hollister Co., and Hollister Co. does not manufacture goods or operate a store in the city of Hollister. In 2009, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch threatened to sue local merchants in the city of Hollister for trademark infringement for attempting to sell clothes bearing the name Hollister, prompting at least one merchant to back down.

<text>San Juan Bautista (Spanish for &quot;Saint John the Baptist&quot;) is a city in San Benito County, in the U.S. state of California. The population was 2,089 as of the 2020 census. San Juan Bautista was founded in 1797 by the Spanish under Fermín de Lasuén, with the establishment of Mission San Juan Bautista. Following the Mexican secularization of 1833, the town was briefly known as San Juan de Castro and eventually incorporated in 1896. Today, San Juan is a popular tourist destination, as the home of the San Juan Bautista State Historic Park and other important historic sites, as well as cultural institutions like El Teatro Campesino.

==History==

Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the area around San Juan Bautista was populated by the Mutsun, a tribe of the Ohlone Nation of Indigenous Californians. The Mutsuns lived in villages in the area around San Juan Bautista, in settlements composed of thatched huts made of willow and native grasses.

===Spanish period===
In 1797, the Spanish Franciscan priest fray Fermín de Lasuén founded Mission San Juan Bautista to facilitate the conversion of the native people to Catholicism; in the process, he claimed the land for the Spanish Empire. Lasuén chose the site because of the area&#x27;s fertile cropland, steady water supply, and sizable Indian population.

Construction of the current mission church began in 1803, and it has served the community continuously since 1812. The mission was located on the Camino Real, a &quot;royal highway&quot; which connected the California missions and which remained well-used until the 19th century.

===Mexican period===

In 1821, Mexico revolted against Spain, winning independence for itself, and making California a province of the newly independent Mexico. By 1834, a town known as San Juan de Castro had sprouted up around the mission. It drew its name from the town&#x27;s prominent &quot;alcalde&quot; José Tiburcio Castro. In 1834 the mission was secularized, and Castro appointed executor of the property. Accordingly, he divided and auctioned off the former mission properties. His son, José Castro, built the Castro Adobe on the south side of the Plaza de San Juan in 1840; however, Castro&#x27;s frequent involvement in government kept him from spending much time there. Castro was a key member of the overthrow of governors Nicolás Gutiérrez in 1836 and Manuel Micheltorena in 1844.

After defeating Micheltorena and his ill-equipped army, José Antonio Castro was appointed Comandante General of California, in charge of the Mexican Army&#x27;s operations in California. From San Juan Bautista, Castro ordered the army against potential foreign incursions. He kept especially close watch over the movements of John C. Frémont, an American military officer who had been let into California to conduct a survey of the interior. Though given explicit instructions to stay away from coastal settlements, Frémont soon broke the agreement by taking his team to Monterey, a potential military target. When Castro told Frémont he would have to leave the country, the situation came close to war when he obstinately refused to leave and instead set up a base on Gavilán Peak, overlooking the town of San Juan. However, fighting was avoided and Frémont, grudgingly, withdrew.

===American period===

San Juan Bautista incorporated as a city on May 4, 1896.

In June 1904, early aviation pioneer John J. Montgomery made a series of successful test flights using his tandem-wing glider in San Juan. This was a prototype to his 1905 gliders that were used to make the first successful high-altitude flights in heavier-than-air flying machines in the world.

Recently, using old photographs and eyewitness accounts, researchers were able to estimate the location of the hypocenter of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake as offshore from San Francisco, or near the city of San Juan Bautista, confirming previous estimates.

In 1930, the last native speaker of Mutsun, Ascención Solórzano de Cervantes, died, rendering the Mutsun language extinct.

In 1971, Luis Valdez moved El Teatro Campesino, one of the most important cultural institutions of the Chicano Movement, to San Juan. Initially, they only had use of La Calavera Theatre, but eventually also built out a larger theatre, simply known as El Teatro Campesino.

<doc id="107982" wikidata="Q823026" url="?curid=107982" title="New Jersey Route 53">
<text>Route 53 is a state highway in Morris County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It runs from U.S. Route 202 in Morris Plains north to U.S. Route 46 in Denville Township. The route, which is a two-lane undivided highway most of its length, intersects with Route 10 and Interstate 80. For most of its length, the route runs a short distance to the east of New Jersey Transit&#x27;s Morristown Line. It passes through industrial areas and wooded residential neighborhoods along its route.

From 1916 to 1927, the route was a part of pre-1927 Route 5, which ran from Delaware in Warren County east to Newark. In 1927, the portion of pre-1927 Route 5 that is today Route 53 was not made a part of a different route and became Route 5N to distinguish it from a newly created Route 5. In 1953, the route became Route 53. A freeway was planned for the route in 1966, running from a planned Route 24 freeway in Morris Plains north to a planned Route 208 freeway in Greenwood Lake in Passaic County. This planned freeway was scaled back in 1967 to end at Interstate 80. It was later designated Route 178 before being canceled in 1975.

==Route description==

Route 53 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 202 (Littleton Road) in Morris Plains. It proceeds north as Tabor Road, a two-lane undivided road closely paralleling New Jersey Transit’s Morristown Line, which runs along the west side of the route. Route 53 bends farther east from the tracks and runs through an industrial area. After passing through the industrial area, the road heads through wooded residential areas, passing under a set of power lines. Further north, Route 53 comes to an interchange with Route 10.
Past the Route 10 interchange, the road enters Parsippany–Troy Hills and continues north through wooded residential neighborhoods, running parallel to Interstate 80 (I-80) while passing to the east of a couple small lakes. It begins to turn northwest before passing by the Mt. Tabor Country Club. Route 53 continues north through Mount Tabor before crossing into Denville Township, where the route becomes East Main Street. In Denville, the route passes under New Jersey Transit&#x27;s Montclair-Boonton Line near Denville Station. Route 53 then comes to an interchange with I-80, where the route becomes a four-lane, divided highway. Shortly after meeting I-80, the route terminates at an interchange with U.S. Route 46.

==History==

What is now Route 53 was once part of a Lenape Trail running from Morristown to Denville. In 1916, present-day Route 53 was designated as part of pre-1927 Route 5, which ran from Delaware in Warren County east to Newark. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, this route became Route 6 (now U.S. Route 46) between Delaware and Denville, Route 32 (now U.S. Route 202) between Morris Plains and Morristown, and Route 24 (now Route 124) between Morristown and Newark. The portion of pre-1927 Route 5 between Morris Plains and Denville, however, was not replaced by a different route and became Route 5N to distinguish it from a newly created Route 5. The northern terminus of Route 5N was at U.S. Route 46/Route 6 (Bloomfield Avenue) in Denville; when those routes were moved to a bypass, Route 5N&#x27;s northern terminus remained at Bloomfield Avenue. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 5N was renumbered to Route 53.

In 1966, a freeway was planned for the Route 53 corridor, intended to reduce traffic congestion. The freeway was intended to run from a planned Route 24 freeway in Morris Plains and continue north, crossing Interstate 80 and Route 23 before ending at a planned Route 208 freeway near Greenwood Lake in Passaic County that would connect to the New York State Route 208 freeway that was to continue north into Orange County, New York. In 1967, the northern terminus of the Route 53 freeway was cut back to Interstate 80. This freeway was designated Route 178 in 1969. Right-of-way acquisition began for the freeway but was stopped in 1971 due to lack of funds. The freeway was officially cancelled in 1975 when NJDOT did not include it in the five-year highway program. Despite the cancellation of the proposed freeway, several large corporations in Morris County pushed for the freeway to be built as it would reduce commuter traffic on Route 53 and US 202 in the area.

<doc id="107983" wikidata="Q354110" url="?curid=107983" title="Adelanto, California">
<text>Adelanto (Spanish for &quot;Advance&quot;) is a city in San Bernardino County, California, United States. It is approximately northwest of Victorville in the Victor Valley area of the Mojave Desert, in the northern region of the Inland Empire. The population was 38,046 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The area was originally inhabited by the Serrano Native American tribe.

Adelanto was founded in 1915 by E. H. Richardson, the inventor of what became the Hotpoint electric iron. He sold his patent and purchased land for $75,000. He had planned to develop one of the first planned communities in Southern California.

The name &quot;Adelanto&quot; means &#x27;progress&#x27; or &#x27;advance&#x27; in Spanish, and was first given to the post office that was established on the site in 1917.

Acres of deciduous fruit trees once grew in the city, which became known in the state for its fresh fruit and cider. The orchards thrived until the Great Depression, when they were replaced by poultry ranches. As the wartime emergency developed early in 1941, the Victorville Army Air Field was established with land within the Adelanto sphere of influence. In September 1950, the airfield was named George Air Force Base in honor of the late Brigadier General Harold H. George.

Adelanto continued as a &quot;community services district&quot; until 1970 when the city incorporated, and Adelanto became San Bernardino County&#x27;s then smallest city. The city became a charter city in November 1992.

Adelanto had a card room called the Hi Desert Casino which operated from 1975 to 1997. The casino was located across from city hall at the corner of Air Expressway and U.S. Highway 395. It boasted a fine restaurant and bar and people came from all over San Bernardino County to play cards.

During the 2000s United States housing bubble, many large suburban subdivisions were built in the southern portion of the city, along Highway 18. Like neighboring Victorville, Adelanto suffered severely from the collapse of real estate values after the 2007–2008 financial crisis. While most of California has seen property values rise to historic highs, much of the Victor Valley region has yet to recover to the 2006 peak. However, in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a resurgence in suburban and exurban housing demand. Formerly affordable areas in the Inland Empire have become increasingly expensive, and the region has experienced a major boom in logistics and industrial development. As a result, residents and businesses seeking affordable properties have been increasingly looking further north along Interstate 15 and into Victorville and Adelanto.

==Economy==
Historically Adelanto was a fruit-growing town. Prior to 1992, much of the economy was related to the George Air Force Base. After its closure the city began having economic difficulties. The openings of several area prisons began in 1991, and the city government approved the construction of two private prisons. The prisons were not required to hire people within the Adelanto city limits. The city, as of 2016, collects $160,000 annually in total from the prisons within the city limits. That year Jimi Devine of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote that the prisons &quot;had mixed effects on the community for 25 years.&quot; Matt Tinoco of &quot;Vice&quot; wrote that &quot;the prisons have failed to stimulate lasting growth in Adelanto&quot; and that &quot;all ultimately ended up contributing little to the city&#x27;s coffers.&quot; Tinoco further stated that Adelanto had an &quot;image as one big jail.&quot;

The privately owned Adelanto Detention Center, run by the GEO Group to house immigrant detainees, was built in Adelanto in 1991 as a state prison. In 2014, when a private developer proposed another prison, the city council approved a development agreement with the private developer that under California subdivision law allows the city to negotiate terms to provide additional benefits to the city. The city had little latitude to deny the private project as the land was appropriately zoned for use as a prison.

The city has only a few retail stores and restaurants. A bed tax contributes about $200,000 annually from the detention facilities. The small city has struggled as tax revenue fell far short of the city budget. In 2013, they closed a fire station and laid off a quarter of the town&#x27;s staff. Residents though turned down a nearly 8% utility users tax in November 2013.

===Cannabis===

Upon the legalization of the sale and distribution of cannabis in 2016, marijuana cultivation was considered a possible new source of revenue for the city. Companies must be licensed by the local agency and the state to grow, test, or sell cannabis and the city may authorize none or only some of these activities. Local governments may not prohibit adults, who are in compliance with state laws, from growing, using, or transporting marijuana for personal use.

The city decided to allow multiple types of marijuana businesses, including cultivation, manufacturing and retail sales. By 2019, two cannabis dispensaries were serving recreational users as the city council considered proposed changes to the city&#x27;s cannabis laws to generate additional revenue to help close the city budget gap. The city is the only Victor Valley municipality to allow storefront cannabis dispensaries. A indoor cultivation facility was opened in 2019 by the California arm of Tikun Olam.

===Federal prisons===

==Arts and culture==

Established in 1921 as part of the San Bernardino County&#x27;s library system, the Adelanto Library began in the office of a fruit company.

El Mirage Dry Lake, west of Adelanto, has been used for filming movies and television commercials, most notably the opening sequence of the later episodes of the TV series &quot;Sky King&quot;.

== Sports ==

From 1991 to 2016, the city was home to the High Desert Mavericks, a Minor League Baseball team of the Class A-Advanced California League.

For the 2017 season, the Pecos League established the High Desert Yardbirds to fill the void at Adelanto Stadium. The team closed their last season at the stadium in 2019.

The Adelanto Elementary District has nine elementary schools, three combined K-8 schools (one of them a virtual school, and three middle schools. High school-aged students in all of those elementary and middle school districts attend schools in the Victor Valley Union High School District (VVUSD), including Adelanto High School, the first high school in Adelanto city limits, or in the neighboring Snowline Joint Unified School District centered in Phelan.

Charter schools include:
*Taylion Academy
*Mojave River Academy
*Desert Trails Preparatory Academy - Formed in 2013 after a parent trigger law was used to remove Desert Trails Elementary from AESD control

==Infrastructure==
Until 2001, Adelanto had its own police department, which was disbanded due to corruption, but now contracts with the San Bernardino County Sheriff&#x27;s Department for police services. The Adelanto Substation is on US Highway 395 and Bartlett Avenue. The station provides full service law enforcement for the City of Adelanto, and unincorporated areas of the Victor Valley such as Phelan, Lucerne Valley, and Spring Valley Lake. The former regional station (next to the Victorville Courthouse), serving unincorporated areas of the Victor Valley, was consolidated into the Adelanto Station in 2009.

Until 1999, fire protection was provided by the city&#x27;s own fire department. The city now contracts with the San Bernardino County Fire Department. There is one station within the city limits providing paramedic service as well as fire and rescue services. Ambulance and patient transportation is provided by American Medical Response.

<text>Apple Valley is an incorporated town in the Victor Valley of San Bernardino County, California, United States. Its population was 75,791 as of the 2020 United States Census. The town is east of and adjoining to the neighboring cities of Victorville and Hesperia, south of Barstow, and north of San Bernardino through the Cajon Pass. It was incorporated on November 14, 1988, and is one of the 22 incorporated municipalities in California that use &quot;town&quot; in their names instead of &quot;city&quot;.

==History==
For centuries, Apple Valley was populated by Shoshonean, Paiute, Vanyume, Chemehuevi, and Serrano who were attracted to the water and vegetation around the Mojave River. The Mojave people came later and were the tribal group encountered in 1542 by a detachment of Coronado&#x27;s men. These were the first Spanish to come to the Mojave desert.

Pedro Fages came through the area in 1772, looking for deserters. Father Francisco Garcés spent time in the area in 1776. He was on good terms with local tribes. He killed one of his mules to feed a group of starving Vanyumes. Garcés established a trail across the Mojave to the Colorado River passing through the Apple Valley area.

The area was explored by various Spanish gold seekers in the 18th and 19th centuries. Jedediah Smith established the Old Spanish Trail through the southern Mojave and Cajon Pass. Smith was in the area in 1826 and again in 1827.

Throughout the 19th century, Apple Valley became a thoroughfare of people traveling to Southern California for various reasons. Ute horse thieves, led by Chief Walkara, brought through an estimated 100,000 horses from their raids on the Lugo Rancho and San Gabriel Mission.

In 1848, members of the Mormon Battalion, mustered out of the U.S. Army after constructing the first wagon road across the southwest to San Diego and up to Los Angeles, brought 135 mules and the first wagon through the Cajon Pass up through the Mojave River Valley on the way to the Salt Lake Valley. Battalion leader Jefferson Hunt and a crew of cowboys followed the trail with the first cattle drive from Southern California to hungry members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in present-day Utah. Hunt led a Latter-day Saint group of settlers to the San Bernardino Valley in 1851.

In 1885, the railroad came northward through the Cajon Pass and established a train stop, calling it Victor (Victorville) on the Mojave River in the area then known as Mormon Crossing. John Brown helped build some of the first roads through Apple Valley, opening up freight and stagecoach travel from the mining camps at Gold Mountain and Holcomb Valley to the railroad. In the 1860s, LaFayette Mecham built the wagon road, a short-cut across the desert, now known as Stoddard Wells Road. Over the next few decades, Victorville boomed as the commercial center of the area with gold refineries, quarries, and dance halls and saloons, while Apple Valley remained more pastoral with ranches and apple orchards.

The Apple Valley name was officially recognized when a post office was established in 1949.

One well-known apple orchard was owned by Max Ihmsen, publisher of the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; newspaper. In 1915, he developed of apples and pears. The fame of Apple Valley spread as Ihmsen&#x27;s fruit won many agricultural awards. In the late 1930s, Ihmsen&#x27;s son-in-law, Cal Godshall, took over the business operations and made the ranch famous as the birthplace of California college rodeo with the first intercollegiate rodeo competition held in the United States.

Apple farming in the area started to decline about the time Ihmsen Ranch fruit production was at its prime. Water rates shot up with a switch to electric pumps. World War I took owners and workers away with the draft. During the Great Depression, many families left the mostly agricultural area looking for work. Washington and British Columbia apple growers had lower prices because they shipped their produce by river transportation, whereas Apple Valley apples were transported by rail or by truck. A series of outbreaks of a virulent fungal infection coupled with frost, heat, and hail in 1944, 1945, and 1946 ended commercial production.

A small orchard was maintained on the grounds of the Apple Valley Inn until it closed in 1986.

Apple Valley was home to Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, whose museum was first established in Apple Valley (in 1967) before the museum was relocated to Victorville in 1976. In 2003, the museum moved again, to Branson, Missouri. The move was made in hopes of reaching more fans; however, the museum closed for financial reasons on December 12, 2009.

<text>Barstow is a city in San Bernardino County, California, in the Mojave Desert of Southern California. Located in the Inland Empire region of California, the population was 25,415 at the 2020 census. Barstow is an important crossroads for the Inland Empire and home to Marine Corps Logistics Base Barstow.

==History==

Prehistoric Native American tribes inhabited the region as long as 3,000 years ago. The Native Americans hunted, fished and gathered turquoise. The indigenous people left hardly any discernible footprints along faint pathways as they traveled up to the Mexican territory to trade goods. The written history of the Mojave Valley dates back to the 1700s and the missionary excursions of Spanish Franciscan friar Francisco Garcés. Garcés followed the earliest faint footpaths to the Mojave River Valley and from there across the desert around Barstow on his way to Spanish missions beyond the mountains of California.

The settlement of Barstow began in the late 1840s in the Mormon Corridor. Every fall and winter, as the weather cooled, the rain produced new grass growth and replenished the water sources in the Mojave Desert. People, goods, and animal herds would move from New Mexico and later Utah to Los Angeles, along the Old Spanish Trail from Santa Fe, or after 1848, on the Mormon Road from Salt Lake City. Trains of freight wagons traveled back to Salt Lake City and other points in the interior. These travelers followed the course of the Mojave River, watering and camping at Fish Ponds on its south bank (west of Nebo Center) or 3.625 miles up river on the north bank, at a riverside grove of willows and cottonwoods, festooned with wild grapes, called Grapevines (later the site of North Barstow). In 1859, the Mojave Road followed a route that was established from Los Angeles to Fort Mojave through Grapevines that linked eastward with the Beale Wagon Road across northern New Mexico Territory to Santa Fe.

Troubles with the Paiute, Mojave, and Chemehuevi tribes followed, and from 1860 Camp Cady, a U.S. Army post east of Barstow, was occupied sporadically until 1864, then permanently, by soldiers occupying other posts on the Mojave Road or patrolling in the region until 1871. Trading posts were established at Grapevines and Fish Ponds that supplied travelers on the roads and increasingly the miners that came into the Mojave Desert after the end of hostilities with the native people.

Barstow&#x27;s roots also lie in the rich mining history of the Mojave Desert following the discovery of gold and silver in the Owens Valley and in mountains to the east in the 1860s and 1870s. Due to the influx of miners arriving in Calico and Daggett, railroads were constructed to transport goods and people. The Southern Pacific built a line from Mojave, California through Barstow to Needles in 1883. In 1884, ownership of the line from Needles to Mojave was transferred to the Santa Fe Railroad.

Paving the major highways through Barstow led to further development of the city. Much of its economy depends on transportation. Before the advent of the interstate highway system, Barstow was an important stop on both Routes 66 and 91. The two routes met in downtown Barstow and continued west together to Los Angeles. The intersection of U.S. Route 91 and U.S. Route 466 was among the busiest intersections in the country—with about 800 gallons of gasoline being pumped per day nearby, during the year before U.S. Route 40 was extended to bypass Barstow. By the end of the 20th century, U.S. Routes 40, 91, and 466 were renamed or truncated as to no longer cover California and Nevada—with Interstates 15 and 40 now being the main interstate highways going in and out of Barstow.

Barstow is named after William Barstow Strong, former president of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. Some early Barstow names were Camp Sugarloaf, Grapevine, Waterman Junction and Fishpond.

<text>Big Bear City is an unincorporated community in San Bernardino County, California, United States along the east shore of Big Bear Lake and surrounded by the San Bernardino National Forest. It is northeast of the city of San Bernardino, and immediately east of the incorporated city of Big Bear Lake. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Big Bear City as a census-designated place (CDP). Its population was 12,304 at the 2010 census, up from 5,779 at the 2000 census. Big Bear City is mostly residential, with smaller houses and cabins laid out in typical square block fashion. Big Bear is on the Pacific Crest Trail.

Standard Air Lines of Los Angeles began a regular airline service to the community in the summer of 1929. Its post office was founded as Van Duesen in 1927 but changed its name to Big Bear City six months later. The Big Bear City Post Office opened in 1928 and still operates.

Despite the name, Big Bear City is not an incorporated city, and should not be confused with the adjacent incorporated city of Big Bear Lake.

==Etymology==

Big Bear got its name due to the large number of grizzly bears that once roamed the area. Although grizzly bears went extinct in the valley at the turn of the 20th century, there are still thousands of black bears found in Big Bear Valley.

==History==

===Pre-colonial period===
The first humans to inhabit Big Bear Valley were the Serrano Indians, who trace their beginnings to Bear Valley. Serrano means &quot;mountaineers&quot;, or &quot;those of the Sierras&quot;. The Serrano people that settled much of the San Bernardino Mountains, called themselves Yuhaviatam, or: &quot;people of the pines&quot;.

It is estimated that the Serrano natives first settled in Big Bear between 1,500 and 2,000 years ago. The Serranos had both winter and summer settlements throughout the area. While their winter village was located in Lucerne Valley, they relocated to villages in the San Bernardino mountains during summer, as the altitude provided cooler temperatures. Villages were often located by rivers and lakes, however, mountain hunting camps were also established on higher elevations. Besides hunting, they also consumed pinyon nuts, mesquite beans, screw-beans, juniper berries and seeds. One of four major Serrano ethnographic sites was located in Big Bear City, called: Kayah-pia-t. Big Bear, and Lucerne Valley clans, both belonged to the same tribe: the &quot;Coyote Pervetum&quot;.

Settling here because of the region&#x27;s many natural resources, they harvested acorns and herbs, but also hunted deer, rabbits, and other wildlife. A number of mortar holes can be seen in Big Bear City; these holes made by the Serranos, were utilized to ground acorns into meals. The oldest known remains of a human settlement in Big Bear Valley can be seen at the Indian Grinding Rocks in Big Bear City, called: The Eye of God, which is a sacred site to the Serrano people. The Serrano&#x27;s creation narrative took place at &quot;The Eye of God&quot;, which was known as Hatauva.

The earliest known contact with European settlers in Big Bear occurred when Spanish Father Francisco Garcés arrived during his 1774-1776 expedition. Another source states, that the first contact happened in 1845 during a punitive expedition against the Native-Americans.

==Geography==

For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Big Bear City as a census-designated place (CDP). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , 99.95% of it land, and 0.05% of it water.

The nearby ski resorts consist of Snow Summit and Bear Mountain.

Most of the town and the business district are centered on Big Bear Boulevard. Its limits are defined on the west by Division Road and on the east by the left turn at Highway 38, which goes to Redlands and Highway 18 which goes south to San Bernardino and north to Lucerne Valley. Though its south boundary is loosely defined by the residential boundary, the north side is defined by North Shore Road. The east-west postal divider of Big Bear City is Green Way Drive. It is here that Highway 18 (Big Bear Boulevard) turns north and crosses over to North Shore Drive heading east toward Lucerne Valley, and Highway 38 coming from the east turns north to North Shore and heads west to Big Bear Dam in the city of Big Bear Lake, California.

Sugarloaf is a large residential area that lies to the south of Big Bear City.

<text>Big Bear Lake is a city in San Bernardino County, California, located in the San Bernardino Mountains along the south shore of Big Bear Lake, and surrounded by the San Bernardino National Forest. The city is about northeast of the city of San Bernardino, and immediately west of the unincorporated town of Big Bear City. The population was approximately 5,019 at the 2010 census, down from 5,438 at the 2000 census. However, as a popular year-round resort destination, the actual number of people staying in or visiting the greater Big Bear Valley area regularly surges to over 100,000 during many weekends of the year.

==History==
Big Bear Lake was inhabited by the indigenous Serrano people for over 2,000 years before it was explored by Benjamin Wilson and his party. Once populated by only the natives and the grizzly bears, from which the area received its name, the population of the Big Bear Valley grew rapidly during the Southern California gold rush from 1861 to 1912. Grizzly bears were not found in the region after 1908. Black bears have been in the region since their introduction in 1933, and they are sometimes sighted in residential areas.

A trip to Big Bear Lake from San Bernardino took two days on horse-drawn coaches. Kirk Phillips was a local who took a trip to New York City and saw the world&#x27;s first bus line. This inspired him to create the world&#x27;s second bus line from San Bernardino to Big Bear Valley using white trucks with several rows of seats. This made it possible for the villages to grow and for Big Bear Lake to become the first mountain recreation area in Southern California.

Many people traveled to enjoy recreation on the lake. However, another major draw was the natural hot spring. Emile Jesserun bought of land that included the hot spring and built the first major resort in Big Bear, the Pan Hot Springs Hotel, in 1921. This resort was followed with others that strove to be the best by creating a country club atmosphere, complete with the amenities required to lure the Hollywood celebrities of the time including Cecil B. DeMille, Shirley Temple, and Ginger Rogers. By 1924, Big Bear was populated with 44 resorts and a constant stream of vacationers. The Pan Hot Springs Hotel, like many of the other resorts and hotels in Big Bear, was extensively damaged by fire in 1933.

In 1933, the California Fish and Game Commission transported around 27 black bears from Yosemite National Park to Southern California, releasing them near Big Bear. Sightings of the newly released bears in cities stoked fear among residents. J. Dale Gentry, chairman of the Fish and Game Commission, resigned shortly after. 

For Hollywood&#x27;s film industry, the area has been a popular place for shooting on location since the silent era. In late November 1915, Universal Studios filmed there for its three-reel production of &quot;John o&#x27; the Mountains&quot; starring Sydney Ayres and Louella Maxam. The 1920 version of &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot; was filmed there as well, as were some scenes for the 1936 film &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, 20th Century Fox&#x27;s 1960 film &quot;North to Alaska&quot;, Disney&#x27;s &quot;Old Yeller&quot;, the 1969 musical film &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot;, the 1983 movie &quot;War Games&quot;, and the 1985 &quot;dark comedy&quot; &quot;Better Off Dead&quot;. Many television series have filmed sequences there too, including opening sequences in 1969 for the NBC children&#x27;s program &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot;.

Winter activities are also popular in Big Bear. The first ski jump in Big Bear was erected in 1929 and quickly claimed a world ski jump record. More jumps were built in Big Bear Lake and the Viking Ski Club of Los Angeles began to use them for competition and events. The move to a winter resort town was solidified in 1952 when Tommy Tyndall opened a resort in Big Bear Lake, now known as Snow Summit. In some winters the area gets little snow, but snow machines keep the resorts in business.

In the summer of 1968, Caltech began construction of Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) located on the north shore of Big Bear Lake. Due to extensive rain and snow, the lake rose several feet and BBSO was surrounded by water at the time construction was completed using makeshift barges in May 1970. BBSO, now operated by the New Jersey Institute of Technology, is still a major Big Bear Lake landmark connected to the north shore by a dirt and rock causeway.

Since 1970, Big Bear Lake has held an annual Oktoberfest. The Big Bear Lake Oktoberfest sports the highest beer garden, by elevation, in the United States. Big Bear Lake was incorporated as a city on November 28, 1980.

During the 1990s, the city became famous as a training spot for boxing champions. Oscar De La Hoya, Mike Tyson, Fernando Vargas, Gennady Golovkin, and Shane Mosley are among the famous boxers who have trained at Big Bear.

In February 2013, a major manhunt occurred in the Big Bear Lake area to find Christopher Dorner, who by that point had killed three people. A standoff ended in nearby Angelus Oaks.

Big Bear Lake is the highest and coldest incorporated city in southern California.

In contrast to most of southern California, the Big Bear Lake region normally receives significant winter snow because of its high elevation. Snowfall, as measured at lake level, averages per season; upwards of can accumulate on the forested ridges bordering the lake, at elevations above . In February 1990, of snow were recorded. The most snow in 24 hours was on March 27, 1991. The greatest snow depth was on February 3, 1979. Snow has fallen in every month except July and August.

<text>Bloomington is an urban unincorporated community in San Bernardino County, California, United States. The population was 23,851 at the 2010 census, up from 19,318 at the 2000 census. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Bloomington as a census-designated place (CDP).

Though currently unincorporated, many of the town&#x27;s political activists are pushing for Bloomington to attain cityhood, while the nearby cities of Rialto and Fontana are attempting to annex the community. The incorporation effort is led by the Bloomington Incorporation Committee.

==History==
Bloomington was originally developed as part of the land holdings of the Semi-Tropic Land and Water Company, which was formed in 1887.

In 1907, the Riverside Portland Cement Company built a large plant near the Crestmore Quarries (South Bloomington), and to provide transportation for employees built a standard gauge railroad to Riverside. On May 20, 1911 the line was opened to Bloomington. The original community, known as Crestmore, is generally located between Locust Avenue and Larch Avenue, south of Jurupa Avenue, extending to the Riverside County line. The Pacific Electric Crestmore Line (Riverside–Rialto) provided local service for many years.

The Semi-Tropic Land and Water Company (now known as West Valley Water District) laid out the town sites of Bloomington, Rialto, Fontana, and Sansevaine. The town site for Bloomington, after being surveyed in April, 1888, was bounded on the north by Valley Boulevard, on the south by Slover Avenue, on the east by Larch Avenue, and on the west by Linden Avenue.

Part of the community is still rural and many residents continue to keep and raise animals. The cities of Rialto and Colton are both trying to annex much of the land now within Bloomington.

In 1989, full incorporation was not completed due to budget and staff constraints.

In 2007, the Bloomington Incorporation Committee (BIC) applied with the Local Agency Formation Commission for another attempt for incorporation. It failed in late February and early March, when the Local Agency Formation Commission denied an extension that BIC needed in order to pay a $109,000 deposit for feasibility and financial studies.

===Community Protests of Warehousing===
In 2022, there was protest by community members, when the county approved to destroy an elementary school in favor of a warehouse

In 2024, community members protested the demolition of 117 homes in favor of warehouses that were approved by the county supervisors

In late September 2024, a San Bernardino County Superior Court Judge halted all construction on the Bloomington Business Park, finding that the San Bernardino County officials had failed to conform to state law in its Environmental Review by not sufficiently informing stake-holders (decision-makers and the public) of the environmental consequences of the proposed development. The County will have to re-do the Environmental Review so as to conform to State Law. Community members bemoaned the loss of over 100 homes in a project that may not proceed.

<doc id="107991" wikidata="Q506395" url="?curid=107991" title="Chino, California">
<text>Chino ( ; Spanish for &quot;Curly&quot;) is a city in the western end of San Bernardino County, California, United States, with Los Angeles County to its west and Orange County to its south in the Southern California region.

Chino&#x27;s surroundings have long been a center of agriculture and dairy farming, providing milk products in Southern California and much of the southwestern United States. Chino&#x27;s agricultural history dates back to the Spanish land grant forming Rancho Santa Ana del Chino. The area specialized in fruit orchards, row crops, and dairy.

Chino is bounded by Chino Hills and Los Angeles County to the west, Pomona to the northwest, unincorporated San Bernardino County (near Montclair) to the north, including the unincorporated community of Narod, Ontario to the northeast, Eastvale to the southeast in Riverside County and Orange County to the southwest. It is easily accessible via the Chino Valley (71) and Pomona (60) freeways. The population was 91,403 at the 2020 census.

==Etymology==
The land grant on which the town was founded was called Rancho Santa Ana del Chino. &quot;Santa Ana&quot; is Spanish for Saint Anne, but the exact meaning of &quot;Chino&quot; has been explained in different ways. One explanation is that the &quot;Chino&quot; (curly-haired person or mixed-race person) was the chief of the local Native American village. The president of the Chino Valley Historical Society, drawing on Civil War-era letters, designates the &quot;curl&quot; referenced in the toponym as that at the top of the grama grass that abounded in the valley.

==History==
The Tongva had a settlement called Wapijangna in the Santa Ana River watershed. Some residents of Wapijanga were baptized at Mission San Gabriel, which was established in 1771. The Spanish crown claimed the land until Mexican independence was finalized and possession fell to the Mexican government.

Some twenty years later, Mexican governor of Alta California Juan Bautista Alvarado granted Rancho Santa Ana del Chino to Antonio Maria Lugo of the Lugo family. Two years later, his successor, Governor Micheltorena, granted an additional three leagues to Lugo&#x27;s son-in-law Isaac Williams, who took charge of the rancho. Williams kept large quantities of horses and cattle, which attracted the envy of raiding Native Americans as well as unscrupulous whites. One of the latter was James Beckwourth, who, in 1840, posed as an otter hunter and stayed at Rancho Chino to determine the location of the area&#x27;s animals, which he then reported to Walkara, the Ute mastermind of the raids.

Early in the Mexican–American War, the Battle of Chino took place at Williams&#x27; rancho. The battle ended prior to the arrival of the Mormon Battalion, dispatched on behalf of the United States, who instead labored in the rancho&#x27;s agricultural harvest and constructed a grist mill.

During the California Gold Rush, the rancho was a popular stopover for travelers, and in the mining fury, coal was discovered there. In 1850, California was admitted to the union, and the process of separating privately held lands from the public domain began. The Williams claim to the Chino Rancho was patented in 1869.

Richard Gird was the next owner of the Rancho. Beginning in 1887, his land was subdivided and laid out. It became the &quot;Town of Chino&quot;, and incorporated into a city in 1910. Sugar beets, corn, and alfalfa were raised there.

The Chino Valley, located at the foot of an alluvial plain with fertile topsoil reaching depths of , was an agricultural mecca from the 1890s up through the mid-20th century. Sugar beets were a significant part of the economy in the early 1900s, followed by sweet corn (marketed as &quot;Chino corn&quot; throughout the Pacific coast area), peaches, walnuts, tomatoes, and strawberries. The city&#x27;s official logo/crest features an overflowing cornucopia.

The dairy industry flourished from the 1950s through the 1980s, with dairy-friendly zoning in the southwest corner of San Bernardino County encouraging many ethnic Dutch families to locate there and become the cornerstone of the industry. Chino&#x27;s large, highly efficient dairies made it the largest milk-producing community in the nation&#x27;s largest milk-producing state.

Because of its pastoral setting and rural flavor, Chino was a popular site for Hollywood crews to shoot &quot;Midwestern&quot; settings. 1960s movies included &quot;Bus Riley&#x27;s Back in Town&quot; starring Ann-Margret and Michael Parks; &quot;The Stripper&quot;, with Joanne Woodward; and the mid-1960s TV series &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot;, refashioning Chino&#x27;s rural airport into a British airfield with quonset huts among farm fields.

In the 1970s, Chino developed into a small suburban city, forming the western anchor of the Inland Empire region, and now the city&#x27;s development has gradually taken on a more middle-class character. There are still many industrial areas as well as farm animals such as goats and chickens.

<text>Chino Hillsis a city located in the southwestern corner of San Bernardino County, California, United States. The city borders Los Angeles County on its northwest side, Orange County to its south and southwest, and Riverside County to its southeast.

==History==
===Indigenous===
Prior to the colonization of the area by the Spanish Empire in the late 18th century, the Tongva village of Wapijanga was the major point of influence in what would come to be referred to as Chino Hills. The village was an important point of connection between the Tongva and the Serrano.

=== Spanish and Mexican eras===
After the Spanish founded Mission San Gabriel in 1771, the Chino Hills region was used extensively for grazing by mission cattle. During the Mexican Republic era, the hills were used as spillover grazing from such surrounding Mexican ranchos as Santa Ana del Chino and Rancho La Sierra (Yorba).

=== Early American era===
This land was sold to Richard Gird, the founder of nearby Chino subdivision and from which the town of Chino sprung in 1910. With the building of the Carbon Canyon Mineral Springs in the modern-day Sleepy Hollow region of the city and the new Los Serranos Country Club in Los Serranos, Chino Hills, California, the area became a destination for both Los Angeles tourists and bootleggers during the prohibition because of its isolation. For the same reason, Sleepy Hollow became a destination for hippies and artists during the 1960s. During the late 1980s, an incorporation effort began and in 1991, the city was incorporated with a population of 42,000.

===Development===
Due to its topography of rolling hills, Chino Hills was primarily rural prior to the mid-1970s; most land was utilized for equestrian purposes and for dairies, except for the multi-use purposes of the State of California, promoting jobs for the community through day labor from the Chino Institute for Men on Central Avenue. Rapid and extensive housing developments followed throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, only slowing down in recent years. Most neighborhoods are arranged in a village-type format with strategically placed shopping centers and parks designed to be within walking distance of nearby homes.

The Vellano Country Club, a private golf course and housing development, was designed by golf champion Greg Norman, his first project in the Greater Los Angeles area.

Chino Hills also includes the developed golf course development neighborhood of Los Serranos. Other large master-planned subdivisions without amenities include &quot;Woodview/Village Crossing&quot;, &quot;Gordon Ranch&quot;, &quot;LaBand Village&quot;, &quot;Butterfield Ranch&quot;, &quot;Rolling Ridge&quot;, &quot;Fairfield Ranch&quot;, and &quot;Payne Ranch&quot;.

<doc id="107993" wikidata="Q846606" url="?curid=107993" title="Colton, California">
<text>Colton is a city in San Bernardino County, California, United States. Nicknamed &quot;Hub City&quot;, Colton is located in the Inland Empire region of the state and is a suburb of San Bernardino, approximately south of the city&#x27;s downtown. The population of Colton is 52,154 according to the 2010 census, up from 47,662 at the 2000 census.

Colton is the site of Colton Crossing, which was one of the busiest at-grade railroad crossings in the United States. The crossing was installed in 1882 by the California Southern Railroad to cross the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks while building northward from San Diego. As a result of railroad acquisitions and mergers, this became the point at which the Burlington Northern Santa Fe&#x27;s &quot;Southern Transcontinental Route&quot; crossed the Union Pacific&#x27;s &quot;Sunset Route&quot;. As traffic on each line began to soar in the mid-1990s, fueled largely by the vast increase in imports passing through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the primitive crossing became a serious bottleneck. On August 28, 2013, the at-grade crossing was officially replaced by a fly-over that raises the east–west UP tracks over the north–south BNSF tracks.

Despite its status as a railroad town, Colton does not have passenger rail service. Passenger trains operated by Amtrak and Metrolink pass through Colton but do not stop there.

==History==

===Indigenous peoples===
Before Spanish settlement, the area was inhabited by the Tongva, Serrano, and Cahuilla. The Tongva village of Homhoangna was located in the area that is now Colton, situated near the base of the foothills of Reche Canyon, historically known as Homhoa Canyon, derived from the Tongva language word &quot;homhoabit&quot; or &quot;hilly place.&quot;

===Spanish and Mexican settlement===
During the Mission Era the Mission San Gabriel established a Spanish settlement Politana in 1810, just northeast of what is now Colton. By 1840, Colton was part of two private ranchos, Jurupa and San Bernardino Rancho. From southwest area of modern-day Colton was known as &quot;Agua Mansa&quot; (Gentle Waters). It had been settled by New Mexico pioneers in 1842. What is currently known as Cooley Ranch was known as Indian Knolls for nearly 100 years. This is because the Indians living in what is now the San Bernardino Valley found refuge on the knolls of the property during the flood of 1862.

===American settlement===
The original owner of the property was George Cooley of Kent, England who had moved to Colton in 1853 and who purchased 200 acres at $3.50 an acre along the Santa Ana River the next year. Cooley was chairman of the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors in San Bernardino County. By 1873, the property had mushroomed into a 400-acre property. Eventually, when property taxes had increased, the property was sold to Villelli Enterprises of La Habra. The city was named after David Douty Colton, who had been a brigadier general of the California State Militia in 1855, prior to the Civil War. He was later the vice president of the Southern Pacific Railroad Company.

Colton was created in its modern form when the Southern Pacific Railway was built heading east from Los Angeles in 1875. It was founded in 1875 and incorporated in 1887. Colton was the site of conflict between the Southern Pacific Transportation Company and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway at Colton Crossing when both railroads wanted to cross through the town.

Virgil Earp lived in Colton at 528 West “H” Street where he was the town&#x27;s first marshal. He resided in Colton from 1883 to 1889. Morgan Earp is buried at Hermosa Cemetery.

===1950s to present===
In 1953, a significant portion of the historic downtown of Colton was bulldozed to make room for the Ramona Freeway, which would later be named the San Bernardino Freeway. This included the block on the west side of Eighth Street north of J, including the then 70-year-old Helman&#x27;s Department Store building, originally housing the First National Bank of Colton, on the corner and the Willet&#x27;s Department Store building to its north. Both stores moved to locations further north on Eighth.

<doc id="107995" wikidata="Q491128" url="?curid=107995" title="Fontana, California">
<text>Fontana is a city in San Bernardino County, California, United States. Founded by Azariel Blanchard Miller in 1913, it remained essentially rural until World War II, when entrepreneur Henry J. Kaiser built a large steel mill in the area. It is now a regional hub of the trucking industry, with the east–west Interstate 10 and State Route 210 crossing the city and Interstate 15 passing diagonally through its northwestern quadrant. The city is about east of Los Angeles.

The United States Census Bureau reported that Fontana&#x27;s 2020 population was 208,393, making it the second-most-populous city in San Bernardino County and the 20th largest in the state.

==History==
Native Americans inhabited the area.

Fontana, formerly Rosena from 1898 to 1919, was founded in 1919 by Azariel Blanchard Miller. The name &quot;fontana&quot; is Italian for fountain or water source; the city is close to the Santa Ana River to the east. Within a few years, it became an agricultural town of citrus orchards, vineyards and chicken ranches and astride U.S. Route 66 (now known as Foothill Boulevard). The Fontana area was radically transformed during World War II when Henry J. Kaiser built the Kaiser Steel plant just outside the city limits. At the time, it was one of only two steel mills west of the Mississippi River. To provide for the plant workers&#x27; health needs, Henry J. Kaiser constructed the Fontana Kaiser Permanente medical facility, now the largest managed care organization in the United States.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Fontana was home to a drag racing strip that was a venue in the NHRA circuit. Mickey Thompson&#x27;s Fontana International Dragway was also referred to as Fontana Drag City or Fontana Drag Strip. The original Fontana strip is gone, but the owners of NASCAR&#x27;s new Auto Club Speedway opened a NHRA-sanctioned drag strip just oustside Fontana in mid-2006.

Ro-Val&#x27;s automobile museum, located on Foothill Boulevard on the western outskirts between Fontana and Cucamonga, was the home for many classic automobiles of the 1920s and 1930s, including a huge vehicle once owned by screen actor Fatty Arbuckle. When the Ro-Val museum closed, the vehicles were sold to Bill Harrah, a Nevada casino owner and automobile collector, who placed them on display in the museum located at his casino.

In 2000, the city had a total population of 128,929; by 2020, the city had 212,704 residents. This rapid growth was largely due to the numerous large, new residential developments built in the sparsely populated northern part of the city, as well as with the city&#x27;s aggressive (and highly successful) campaign to annex several unincorporated, but developed, San Bernardino County areas in 2006–2007.

In 2019, the California Air Resources Board advised the City against housing people within 1,000 feet of industrial warehouses because of harmful truck pollution. The city was also sued by San Bernardino County, the Center for Biological Diversity, the Sierra Club and the Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice over the approval of West Valley Logistics Center, which violated state environmental laws.

In 2021, the city was sued by the State of California Attorney General&#x27;s office for violation of the California Environmental Quality Act by encouraging warehouse development in low-income areas.

==Geography==
Most of the city of Fontana, like its eastern neighbors Rialto and San Bernardino, is built atop a geologically young, gently southward-sloping alluvial fan from nearby Lytle Creek, deposited mainly during the Holocene and late-Pleistocene epochs. There are also sedimentary deposits of similar age from Etiwanda Creek on the western edge of the city. However, the northern and southern edges of the city are formed by the much older San Gabriel and Jurupa mountain ranges, respectively. The Jurupa Mountains are composed primarily of Cretaceous and Paleozoic-era rocks, as are the San Gabriels, which also include even older, Proterozoic formations. The most prominent of the San Gabriel Mountains visible from Fontana is Cucamonga Peak, elevation . Additionally, the Cucamonga Fault Zone, contiguous with the Sierra Madre Fault Zone, runs through the northern part of the city, along the base of the San Gabriels, notably through the Hunter&#x27;s Ridge and Coyote Canyon planned communities. It is estimated to be capable of producing earthquakes approximately of magnitude 6.0-7.0.

The city&#x27;s listed elevation, measured from the northeast corner of the intersection of Upland Avenue and Sierra Avenue, downtown by City Hall, is . The highest elevation within the city limits is approximately , in the northernmost part of the Panorama neighborhood of Hunter&#x27;s Ridge. The lowest point within the city limits is approximately , at the intersection of Etiwanda and Philadelphia avenues, in the extreme southwestern corner of the city. This difference in elevation is due to the southward slope of the Lytle Creek alluvial fan.

===Climate===
The city is frequently affected by the strong, hot and dry Santa Ana winds as they blow through the nearby Cajon Pass of the San Gabriel Mountains, from the Mojave Desert. Fontana can also be extremely hot in summer, well over .

<text>Grand Terrace is a city in San Bernardino County, California, United States. The population was 12,040 at the 2010 census, up from 11,626 at the 2000 census. Grand Terrace is located between Highgrove and Colton, along the I-215 and Agua Mansa industrial corridors. The city is located between two mountain ridges: Blue Mountain to the east and the La Loma Hills to the west.

==History==
Grand Terrace&#x27;s roots go back to Mexican land grants dating from the period between 1830 and 1840. Mormon settlers came shortly after, arriving in the San Bernardino Valley, during the 1850s. According to the &quot;Riverside Press&quot;, in 1876, there were nine buildings in the Terrace-Colton area. Originally, the area was simply referred to as &quot;the Terrace&quot;, but the word &quot;Grand&quot; was added around 1898 due to the beautiful views which surround the city. In 1905, Seventh-day Adventists, whose medical university is now located in nearby Loma Linda, settled in the area. Grand Terrace, at the time known as &quot;South Colton&quot;, experienced continued growth and development during the Southern California suburbia and sunbelt periods in the late half of the 20th century.

The development of Grand Terrace, or East Riverside, as the Grand Terrace-Highgrove area was called, became a reality with the construction of the Gage Canal. This 22-1/2-mile canal, built at a cost of 2 million dollars, brought water from the Santa Ana River marshlands below The Terrace. With plenty of irrigation water, Grand Terrace rapidly became an agricultural community featuring fine, quality citrus. The severe &quot;freeze&quot; of 1913 destroyed many groves. Walnuts, a hardier tree, were planted as replacements along with peaches as a quick-profit crop.

The social activities in the early 1900s centered around the Farm Bureau Extension Service and the Women&#x27;s Club, followed by the PTA, in the 1930s. Since there were no local churches, people traveled to surrounding communities for worship and other church activities.

In 1962, the Grand Terrace Chamber of Commerce was organized. From the very beginning the Chamber was interested in preserving the local identity of the area, and therefore, was a strong supporter of cityhood. This group did much of the groundwork, which led to the formation of a local governing body in 1976, which was called the Municipal Advisory Council or MAC. After nearly two years of meetings and negotiations with the county, the residents went to the polls to decide the issue of cityhood. The response was an 82% vote for incorporation. On November 30, 1978, the Charter City Council was installed at Terrace Hills Junior High and Grand Terrace officially became the 16th city in San Bernardino County.

Grand Terrace was named one of the &quot;Top 100 Cities to Live In&quot; by &quot;Money&quot; magazine in 2007.

The name &quot;Hesperia&quot; means &quot;western land&quot;. The 2019 census report estimates that the city has a population of 95,750.

==History==
The first inhabitants of the area were the Desert Serrano (Vanyume). The village of Wá’peat, among several other villages that were located along the Mojave River, were within the vicinity of what is now Hesperia. These villages were occupied into the early 1800s and had deep ties with one another. An acorn-gathering festival was held at Wá’peat that involved villagers from across the Mojave River area.

Hesperia began as a Spanish land grant: &quot;Rancho San Felipe, Las Flores y el Paso del Cajon&quot;, founded in 1781. The land was sparsely inhabited desert during Spanish-Mexican rule in the 19th century. The U.S. annexed the region along with Southern California after the Mexican-American War in 1848.

In 1869, Max Stobel purchased from the United States Government Land Office for $40,000. While several attempts were made to subdivide and encourage colonization, the land was primarily used for agricultural purposes, with raisin grapes the primary product.

The town site was laid out in 1891 by railroad company land developers of the Santa Fe Railroad, which was completed that year. Hesperia was named for Hesperus, the Greek god of the West. The railroad land developers published pamphlets distributed across the country with boosterism of Hesperia, California, as a potential metropolis, to become &quot;the Omaha of the West&quot; or projections to have over 100,000 people by 1900, but only 1,000 moved in.

Hesperia grew relatively slowly until the completion of US Routes 66, 91, and 395 in the 1940s, followed by Interstate 15 in the late 1960s. About of land were laid out for possible residential development.

In the early 1950s, land developer M. Penn Phillips and his silent financial partner, boxer Jack Dempsey, financed the building of roads and land subdivisions, promoting lots sales on television. They built the Hesperia Inn and golf course, which attracted a variety of Hollywood celebrities. The Hesperia Inn also housed the Jack Dempsey Museum.

The main wave of newcomers, though, arrived at Hesperia in the 1980s. Suburban growth transformed the small town of 5,000 people in 1970 to a moderate-sized city with a population over 60,000 by 2000, and an estimated population over 95,000 as of July 1, 2018.

==Geography==

Hesperia is a city in the Mojave Desert, and the California Aqueduct traverses the area. Much of the native flora of Hesperia is classified as California desert vegetation, dominated by junipers, joshua trees, and sagebrush.

<text>Lake Arrowhead is an unincorporated community and a census-designated place (CDP) in the San Bernardino Mountains of San Bernardino County, California, surrounded by the San Bernardino National Forest, and surrounding the eponymous Lake Arrowhead Reservoir. Lake Arrowhead is located 13 miles north east of the San Bernardino city limits. The population of the CDP was estimated at 12,424 in the 2010 census.

Tourism is the primary economic generator for the area, contributing several million dollars per year to the county and providing hundreds of full-time and part-time jobs for local residents. The area is host to over four million visitors a year. There are 400 guest rooms in hotels, motels and bed and breakfasts, vacation cabin rentals, condos, and rustic cabin lodges and resorts.

One author visiting in 1978 described it as a &quot;clean, Swiss-like community with many chalets.&quot; Lake Arrowhead Village also hosts events all year long including a free Summer Concert Series, the county&#x27;s largest free Oktoberfest and many other themed events such as car shows, dog shows, the Tour de Lake Arrowhead, Home Expo, and the popular Antique Wooden Boat Show.

The University of California, Los Angeles operates the nearby UCLA Conference Center, a full-service conference facility with lodging and meeting space. Other major employers include Mountains Community Hospital and Rim of the World Unified School District.

Logging in the San Bernardino Mountains was once done on a large scale, with the Brookings Lumber Company operation one of the largest. It operated on between Fredalba and Hunsaker Flats (present-day Running Springs), between 1899 and 1912. It built a logging railroad to bring logs to the mill at Fredalba. The Shay locomotives had to be disassembled and hauled by wagon up the mountain, since the railroad operated in the high country but did not connect to other railroads in lowlands. Finished lumber was hauled by wagon down the steep grades to the Molino Box Factory in Highland, California.

== Architecture ==

Located approximately from downtown Los Angeles, many Hollywood stars and wealthy Angelinos built homes in the area starting in the 1920s and 30s. These homes and estates were designed by some of the most significant architects practicing in Southern California at the time. These architects included:

*John Byers
*Roland Coate
*Robert Farquhar
*Gordon Kaufman
*Marston, Van Pelt &amp; Maybury
*Morgan, Walls &amp; Clements
*Lutah Marie Riggs
*Lloyd Wright (Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s son)
*Rudolf Schindler
*McNeal Swasey
*Paul Revere Williams
*William Woollett
In the early years of development, the architectural committee of the resort community mandated that homes be built in the French Norman or English Tudor Style. Rudolf Schindler, a modernist architect, designed what is known as the first modern A-frame house in 1936 for Gisela Bennati, as his interpretation of French Norman style architecture. The first known sketches for the Bennati Cabin date from 1934. Schindler did sketches for &quot;triangle-based house designs&quot; as early as 1922, but none of those designs were built. Lake Arrowhead is also home to what has been sometimes referred to as the world’s largest A-frame structure, the clubhouse of the Lake Arrowhead Country Club.

The following is a list of people who have owned or built homes in Lake Arrowhead: John O&#x27;Melveny, J.B. Van Nuys (one of the developers of Lake Arrowhead and son of Isaac Newton Van Nuys, founder of Van Nuys, CA), Rhoda Rindge &amp; Merritt Adamson (founders of Malibu, CA), John Northrop, Katherine Iten (Iten Biscuit Company/NABISCO), Edward L. Doheny, Jules Stein, Conrad &quot;Nicky&quot; Hilton, Jr., Dan Dureya, Max Factor, Thomas F. Hamilton, Prince Massianoff, Leo McCarey, Charlie Chaplin, Myrna Loy, Ruth Hussey, Shirley Temple, Lon Chaney, Doris Day, June Lockhart, Walter Huston, Robert Taylor, Loretta Young, Liberace, Brian Wilson, Priscilla Presley and Frankie Avalon to name a few.

<text>Montclair is a city in the Pomona Valley, in southwestern San Bernardino County, California, east of downtown Los Angeles. The population was 37,865 in the 2020 United States Census.

==History==
The earliest known inhabitants of the area were from the Serrano tribe of Native Americans. The Serrano established their village along a creek named Arroyo de los Alisos, now named San Antonio Creek, which flowed along a route that is now Mills Avenue, the western border of the city.

In 1897, a &quot;Township of Marquette&quot; was founded within the borders of the modern city of Montclair. In 1900, a tract of land was surveyed and named &quot;Monte Vista&quot;. A small settlement to the south of Monte Vista was established in 1907 and named &quot;Narod&quot;. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the settlement was largely devoted to citrus orchards. The Monte Vista tract experienced growth in residential development after the Second World War, and the tract was incorporated as the city of Monte Vista on April 25, 1956. Due to conflict with the Post Office, which refused to open an office in Monte Vista due to a name conflict with a community in Northern California, the city was renamed Montclair on April 8, 1958.

<doc id="108007" wikidata="Q1901255" url="?curid=108007" title="Muscoy, California">
<text>Muscoy is a census-designated place (CDP) in San Bernardino County, California, United States. The population was 10,644 at the 2010 census, up from 8,919 at the 2000 census. Muscoy shares ZIP code 92407 with the communities of Verdemont, Devore Heights, Rosena Ranch and Arrowhead Farms in northwestern San Bernardino. Residents enjoy a semi-rural setting with large lots where they can raise horses and other livestock, nursery plants, and fruit trees. For this reason, much of Muscoy is included in the county Additional Agriculture (AA) overlay, which specifies the types and quantities of animals that may be kept on each parcel. A distinctive feature of Muscoy life today is motor vehicles and equestrians sharing the roadways.

==History==
Muscoy was developed in the mid-1890s as a community designed to accommodate family agricultural
enterprises. Roads and water service were developed to serve one to ten acre parcels. Vineyards, orchards and various field crops were planted and cultivated. After World War II, population growth accelerated and the area began a transition from agricultural use to a more suburban residential character. During the 1950s and 1960s, the San Bernardino area became a popular stop during road trips. This resulted in more shops opening up to serve the needs of travelers, and more people establishing permanent residences around the Muscoy area. In 1989, a gasoline pipeline explosion caused two deaths.

==Geography==
Muscoy is located at (34.156009, -117.346552). Elevation ranges from 1240&#x27; in the south to 1600&#x27; in the north.

<text>Needles is a city in eastern San Bernardino County, California, in the Mojave Desert region of Southern California. Situated on the western banks of the Colorado River, Needles is located near the California border with Arizona and Nevada. The city is accessible via Interstate 40 and U.S. Route 95. The population was 4,959 at the 2020 census, up from 4,844 at the 2010 census.

==History==

Mojave Indians first inhabited the area.

Needles was founded in May 1883 during the construction of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, which originally crossed the Colorado River at Eastbridge, Arizona, three miles southeast of modern Needles. Needles was named after &quot;The Needles&quot;, a group of pinnacles in the Mohave Mountains on the Arizona side of the river. The crossing was a poor site for a bridge, lacking firm banks and a solid bottom.

A bridge was built, but it was of poor quality. Not only was it a &quot;flimsy looking structure&quot;, but it was an obstacle to navigation on the river. Flooding on the Colorado River destroyed the bridge three times – in 1884, 1886 and 1888. The railway built Red Rock Bridge, a high cantilever bridge, at a narrower point with solid rock footings, ten miles downstream near today&#x27;s Topock. The bridge was completed in May 1890, and the old bridge was dismantled.

At first it was a tent town for railroad construction crews, but the railway would eventually build a hotel, car sheds, shops and a roundhouse. Within only a month, Needles would have a Chinese laundry, a newsstand, a restaurant, several general stores, and nine or ten saloons. Needles quickly became the largest port on the river above Yuma, Arizona. The railway and the Fred Harvey Company built the elegant Neoclassical and Beaux-Arts style El Garces Hotel and Santa Fe Station in 1908, which was considered the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of the entire Fred Harvey chain. The landmark building is on the National Register of Historic Places and is being restored.

Needles was a major stop on the historic U.S. Route 66 highway from the 1920s through the 1960s. For migrants from the Midwest Dust Bowl in the 1930s, it was the town that marked their arrival in California. The city is lined with motels and other shops from that era. The &quot;Carty&#x27;s Camp&quot;, which appears briefly in &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; as the Joad family enters California from Arizona, is now a ghost tourist court, its remains located behind the 1940s-era 66 Motel.

In 1949, the United States Bureau of Reclamation began an extensive project to dredge a new channel for the Colorado River that would straighten out a river bend that caused serious silt problems after the Hoover Dam was completed.

Needles is a tourism and recreation center. The city is the eastern gateway to the Mojave National Preserve, a scenic desert area.

<text>Ontario is a city in southwestern San Bernardino County in the U.S. state of California, east of downtown Los Angeles and west of downtown San Bernardino, the county seat. Located in the western part of the Inland Empire metropolitan area, it lies just east of Los Angeles County and is part of the Greater Los Angeles Area. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 175,265.

The city is home to Ontario International Airport, which is the 9th-busiest airport in the United States by cargo carried, as of 2021. Ontario handles the mass of freight traffic between the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach and the rest of the country.

It takes its name from the Ontario Model Colony development established in 1882 by the Canadian engineer George Chaffey and his brothers William Chaffey and Charles Chaffey. They named the settlement after their home province of Ontario.
==History==
=== Tovaangar (before 1771) ===

Ontario was inhabited by the Tongva people for over 1,000 years. Their country is now known as Tovaangar. The Ontario area was connected to the village of Cucamonga, whose location is not now precisely known.

The Spanish Empire&#x27;s New Spain Portolá expedition found and named the Santa Ana River in 1769. They also explored the Cucamonga area.

=== Spanish Empire (1771–1822) ===

In 1771, Franciscans from New Spain settled nearby, and established the Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, founding what is today San Gabriel. They enslaved the Tongva people. The area was now part of the New Spain Province of Las Californias.

Juan Bautista de Anza is said to have passed through the area on his 1774 expedition, which created a land route between the province of Sonora and San Gabriel. An Ontario city park and a middle school now bear his name. The route became known as the El Camino Real.

In 1804, the northern part of Las Californias became the new province of Nueva California.

In 1810, the San Gabriel Franciscans took over the Tongva village of Kaawchama (in today&#x27;s west Redlands), replacing it with the Guachama rancheria. This included a chapel devoted to San Bernardino (beginning the association of the saint with the area). The rancheria was destroyed by the Serrano in 1812, and was rebuilt nearby as the San Bernardino de Sena estancia in 1819.

=== Mexico (1822–1847) ===

In 1822, word of the Mexican triumph in the Mexican War of Independence reached Nueva California, and the lands previously controlled by the Spanish Empire passed to the custody of the Mexican government.

In 1824, the province of Nueva California was renamed Alta California.

In 1826, American explorer Jedediah Smith passed through what is now Upland on the first known overland journey from the east coast to the west coast of North America. He used Native American trails that he helped establish as the California Trail. (This later became the National Old Trails Road, Route 66, and today&#x27;s Foothill Boulevard.)

Use of the San Gabriel mission&#x27;s Rancho Cucamonga was in 1839 granted to Tiburcio Tapia by Alta Californian governor Juan Bautista Alvarado as part of the secularization of California land holdings. This emancipated the Tongva enslaved there.

The name &quot;Mount San Antonio&quot; was probably bestowed by Antonio Maria Lugo, owner of Rancho San Antonio near present-day Compton circa 1840, in honor of his patron saint, Anthony of Padua.

In 1845, Rancho Cucamonga was inherited by Tapia&#x27;s daughter, Maria Prudhomme, and her husband Leon Prudhomme.

=== United States (1847 onward) ===

==== 1800s ====
In January 1847, the area became controlled by the United States following the conquest of California as part of the Mexican-American War, and was formalised by the Treaty of Cahuenga. Under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, the United States recognised the existing land tenure, and took formal control of the land. It ruled it under a military administration until a new civilian body was established in December 1849, which became the state of California in September 1850. In February 1850, the interim California government established Los Angeles County. (The earlier Los Angeles municipal government did not cover today&#x27;s Ontario.)

The new Californian administration soon began a war of extermination against the Tongva, which came to be known as being part of the California genocide. 1850&#x27;s Act for the Government and Protection of Indians ensured that slavery of the people it covered remained legal.

San Bernardino County was founded in 1853, following the establishment of a new Mormon settlement. A road was built between San Bernardino and Los Angeles that year, passing through Rancho Cucamonga.

Rancho Cucamonga was sold in 1858 to John Rains.

Slavery of Native Americans became illegal in California in 1865.

John Rain&#x27;s heirs sold Rancho Cucamonga in 1870 to an Isaias Hellman-led syndicate, the &quot;Cucamonga Company&quot;. 20 years after the initial application, the California government formally converted the title of the rancho to freehold in 1872.

In 1881, the Chaffey brothers, George and William, purchased a parcel of Hellman&#x27;s Rancho Cucamonga land, and rights to Mount San Antonio water. The brothers established a settlement they named &quot;Ontario&quot; in honor of the province of Ontario in Canada, where they were from.

The land was sometimes referred to the &quot;San Antonio lands&quot;, as they included half the water rights to Mount San Antonio (colloquially known as &quot;Mount Baldy&quot;). They engineered a drainage system channelling water from the foothills of the mountain down to the flatter lands below that performed the dual functions of allowing farmers to water their crops and preventing the floods that periodically afflict them.

They also created the main thoroughfare of Euclid Avenue (California Highway 83), with its distinctive wide lanes and grassy median. A mule-drawn passenger tramway was used from 1887 to 1895 on the central reservation the Avenue, operated by the Ontario and San Antonio Heights Railroad Company.

The San Antonio Water Company was incorporated in October 1882. Since then it has served the area that is today Ontario, Upland and San Antonio Heights, and to a lesser extent Montclair.

In 1885, the Chaffey brothers opened a campus of the University of Southern California. This included a secondary school.

Also in 1885, the &quot;Ontario Record&quot; newspaper was founded. (It would later be known as &quot;The Daily Report&quot;.)

The new &quot;Model Colony&quot; (called so because it offered the perfect balance between agriculture and the urban comforts of schools, churches, and commerce) was originally conceived as a dry town, early deeds containing clauses forbidding the manufacture or sale of alcoholic beverages within the town.

Ontario attracted farmers (primarily growing citrus) and ailing Easterners seeking a drier climate (often to treat tuberculosis). To impress visitors and potential settlers with the &quot;abundance&quot; of water in Ontario, a fountain was placed at the Southern Pacific railway station. It was turned on when passenger trains were approaching and frugally turned off again after their departure. The original &quot;Chaffey fountain&quot;, a simple spigot surrounded by a ring of white stones, was later replaced by the more ornate &quot;Frankish Fountain&quot;, an art nouveau creation now located outside the Ontario Museum of History and Art. Agriculture was vital to the early economy, and many street names recall this legacy. The Sunkist plant remains as a living vestige of the citrus era.

The Chaffey brothers left in 1886 to found the Australian irrigation settlements of Mildura and Renmark, selling their Ontario assets to the Ontario Land &amp; Improvement Company. Its president was Charles Frankish. He founded the Ontario State Bank in 1887, the settlement&#x27;s first bank.

Central Ontario was incorporated as a city in 1891. The San Antonio Electric Light &amp; Power Company was organized in 1891 to provide electricity to Ontario, Pomona and Redlands. 

The Graber Olive House was established in 1894, and is now the longest operating olive packing business in the United States.

In 1895, the Ontario Electric Company was established by Charles Frankish. In its first year it took over the mule-cars, and replaced them with electrical powered vehicles.

==== 1900s ====
The City of Ontario&#x27;s territory was greatly expanded in 1900.

Tens of thousands of European immigrants came to work in agriculture. In the early 1900s, the first Filipinos and Japanese farm laborers arrived, and later many came to own plant nurseries.

In 1901, the original college closed, and a new Ontario High School replaced it. This soon became Chaffey College, and offered college courses as well as high school education.

Ontario was declared a &quot;model colony&quot; by an act of Congress in 1903.

North Ontario broke away from the city in 1906, calling itself Upland.

In 1912, the streetcar line became the Upland–Ontario Line of Pacific Electric. It was closed in 1928.

In 1929, the city of Ontario established the Ontario Municipal Airport. This is now the Ontario International Airport, and is the largest employer in the city.

AM radio station KOCS began in 1946, which was followed by sister station KOCS-FM in 1947. The stations initially operated as part of The Daily Report, and would go on to change their name, format and ownership many times.

In 1960, the higher education part of Chaffey College moved to nearby Rancho Cucamonga.

From 1970 to 1980, the Ontario Motor Speedway hosted motor racing events including the California 500, and music events like California Jam.

The Cardenas supermarket chain began in Ontario in 1981.

&quot;The Daily Report&quot; merged with the nearby &quot;Progress Bulletin&quot; to become the &quot;Inland Valley Daily Bulletin&quot; in 1990.

An Ontario station of the Metrolink rail service opened in 1993 (it later became known as &quot;Ontario – East&quot;).

Large shopping mall Ontario Mills opened to the public on November 14, 1996, on the old Ontario Motor Speedway parking lot.

On December 13, 1996, AMC Theatres opened AMC Ontario Mills 30 in Ontario, which it billed as the &quot;world&#x27;s largest theater&quot;. Three months later, Edwards Theaters opened the Edwards Ontario Palace 22 across the street. Ontario now had 52 screens on the one site, more than any other location in the United States. The opening of that many screens in the Inland Empire came about as the culmination of a lifelong rivalry between AMC&#x27;s Stanley Durwood and Edwards Theaters&#x27; James Edwards. Edwards was infuriated when he learned Durwood had beaten him to a deal with Ontario Mills, and later told him, &quot;I had to teach you a lesson&quot;.

The Ontario Convention Centre opened in 1997.

In 1999, the large agricultural area in the south of Ontario (the &quot;ag preserve&quot;) was re-zoned for residential and commercial use. This area was now described as the &quot;New Model Colony&quot;, before being renamed Ontario Ranch, and finally New Haven.

==== 2000s ====
The University of La Verne opened a law-focused campus in Ontario in 2001.

In 2008, the Ontario Community Events Center opened. It hosts a number of professional minor-league indoor sports teams. Also that year, West Coast University opened a campus in the city.

The headquarters of the Southern Baptist Convention&#x27;s Gateway Seminary moved to Ontario in 2016.

Amazon opened their largest United States warehouse in Ontario in 2024.

==Economy==
In the years following Ontario&#x27;s founding, the economy was driven by its reputation as a health resort. Shortly thereafter, citrus farmers began taking advantage of Ontario&#x27;s rocky soil to plant lemon and orange groves. Agricultural opportunities also attracted vintners and olive growers. The Graber Olive House, which continues to produce olives, is a city historical landmark and one of the oldest institutions in Ontario. Dairy farming is also prevalent, as it continues to be in neighboring Chino. Much of southern Ontario still contains dairy farms and other agricultural farms. However, the area is currently under planning to be developed into a mixed-use area of residential homes, industrial and business parks, and town centers, collectively known as the New Model Colony.

A major pre-war industry was the city&#x27;s General Electric plant that produced clothing irons. During and after World War II, Ontario experienced a housing boom common to many suburbs. The expansion of the Southern California defense industry attracted many settlers to the city. With California&#x27;s aerospace industry concentrated in Los Angeles and the Bay Area, the Ontario International Airport was used as a pilot training center. Today, Ontario still has a manufacturing industry, the most notable of which are Maglite, which produces flashlights. Manufacturing has waned, and Ontario&#x27;s economy is dominated by service industries and warehousing. Major distribution centers are operated by companies such as AutoZone, Cardinal Health, MBM, Genuine Parts/NAPA, and Nordstrom.

Ontario is also home to Niagara Bottling, The Icee Company, clothing companies Famous Stars and Straps and Shiekh Shoes, Scripto U.S.A., and to Phoenix Motorcars, who employs over 150 employees in Ontario.

===Top employers===
According to the city&#x27;s 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:

===Tourism===
The Greater Ontario Convention and Visitors Bureau implemented a tourism marketing district and adopted an aggressive five-year strategic plan focusing on marketing initiatives to bring visitors to the region, build brand and destination awareness while enhancing the local economy.

==Arts and culture==
Ontario is home to three museums, the Ontario Museum of History and Art, the Chaffey Community Museum of Art, and the Ontario Police Museum.

Built in 1925, The Granada Theatre was leased to West Coast Junior Theater. By the 1940s, the theater had become part of the Fox West Coast Theater chain. The Granada Theatre was designed by architect L.A. Smith.

Ontario is also the home to the second largest consumer Quilt Show in the United States, &quot;Road to California&quot;. The quilt show books over 2,400 room nights and has a recorded attendance of over 40,000 attendees.

The Ontario post office contains two oil on canvas murals, &quot;The Dream&quot; depicting founder Chaffey with surveyors and &quot;The Reality&quot; which shows a view of the completed Euclid Avenue, painted by WPA muralist Nellie Geraldine Best in 1942.

Since 1958, Ontario has placed three-dimensional nativity scenes on the median of Euclid Avenue during the Christmas season. The scenes, featuring statues by the sculptor Rudolph Vargas, were challenged in 1998 as a violation of church-state separation under the California Constitution by an atheist resident, but the dispute was resolved when private organizations began funding the storage and labor involved in the set-up and maintenance of the scenery in its entirety. To support the nativity scenes the Ontario Chamber of Commerce started a craft fair called &quot;Christmas on Euclid&quot;.

The All-States Picnic, an Independence Day celebration, began in 1939 to recognize the varied origins of the city&#x27;s residents. Picnic tables lined the median of Euclid Avenue from Hawthorne to E Street, with signs for each of the country&#x27;s 48 states. The picnic was suspended during World War II, but when it resumed in 1948, it attracted 120,000 people. A 1941 Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not! cartoon listed Ontario&#x27;s picnic table as the &quot;world&#x27;s longest&quot;. As native Californians came to outnumber the out-of-state-born, the celebration waned in popularity until it was discontinued in 1981. It was revived in 1991 as a celebration of civic pride.

==Sports==
The Toyota Arena is a multipurpose arena which opened in late 2008. It is owned by Ontario, but is operated by SMG Worldwide. It is an 11,000-seat multi-purpose arena, the largest enclosed arena in the Inland Empire. Over 125 events are held annually featuring sporting competitions, concerts, and family shows.

The arena had been the home of the Ontario Reign, a former team in the ECHL, that called the arena home from 2008 to 2015. The Los Angeles Kings&#x27; affiliate played at the 9,736-seat Toyota Arena. In their debut season of 2008–09, they were second in the league in attendance, averaging 5856 fans per game. The Reign led the ECHL in average attendance in every subsequent year.

In January 2015, the American Hockey League, a minor league above the ECHL, announced that it was forming a new Pacific Division and would be replacing the ECHL Ontario Reign with a relocated team. The Kings relocated the Manchester Monarchs, a franchise they had owned and operated since 2012, and became the Ontario Reign beginning with the 2015–16 AHL season.

The Ontario Motor Speedway was located in Ontario, and held races for USAC, Formula One, NHRA, and NASCAR. It was demolished in 1980 after the Chevron Land Company bought the property.

National University, Argosy University, San Joaquin Valley College and Chapman University have a satellite campus near the Ontario Mills mall. Ontario Christian is located there. Gateway Seminary has a campus in Ontario.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
The Ontario International Airport provides domestic and international air travel. Because of the many manufacturing companies and warehouses in the city, the airport also serves as a major hub for freight, especially for FedEx and UPS.

Because Ontario is a major hub for passengers and freight, the city is also served by several major freeways. Interstate 10 and the Pomona Freeway (State Route 60) run east–west through the city. Interstate 10 is north of the Ontario airport while the Pomona freeway is south of the airport. Interstate 15 runs in the north–south directions at the eastern side of the city. State Route 83, also known as Euclid Avenue, also runs in the north–south direction at the western side of the city.

The Amtrak station is serviced by the Sunset Limited and Texas Eagle lines. The Amtrak Thruway 19 provides twice daily connections from this station to/from Bakersfield to the north, and San Bernardino to the east, with several stops in between.

The Ontario-East Metrolink station is located off of Haven Avenue. It connects Ontario with much of the Greater Los Angeles area, Orange County, and the San Fernando Valley.

Public bus transportation is provided by Omnitrans. Additional bus and rail connections to Los Angeles and elsewhere are available at the nearby Montclair station. A bus rapid transit line known as the sbX Purple Line is currently being constructed, which will run through the city.

<doc id="108011" wikidata="Q495365" url="?curid=108011" title="Rancho Cucamonga, California">
<text>Rancho Cucamonga ( ) is a city located just south of the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and Angeles National Forest in San Bernardino County, California, United States. About east of Downtown Los Angeles, Rancho Cucamonga is the 28th most populous city in California. The city&#x27;s seal, which centers on a cluster of grapes, alludes to the city&#x27;s agricultural history including wine-making. The city&#x27;s proximity to major transportation hubs, airports, and highways has attracted the business of several large corporations, including Coca-Cola, Frito-Lay, Big Lots, Mercury Insurance Group, Southern California Edison, and Amphastar Pharmaceuticals.

The city had a population of 174,453 according to the 2020 United States Census.

&quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; popularized the city&#x27;s name, in particular the word &quot;Cucamonga&quot;.

==History==

By 1200 AD, Kukamongan Native Americans had established a village settlement in the area around present-day Red Hill, near the city&#x27;s western border, where Red Hill Country Club stands today. Kukamonga derives its name from a Tongva word meaning &quot;sandy place.&quot; Anthropologists have determined that this cluster of settlers likely belonged to the Tongva people or Kich people, at one time one of the largest concentrations of Native American peoples on the North American continent. In the 18th century, following an expedition led by Gaspar de Portola, the land was incorporated into the Mission System established by Father Junipero Serra and his group of soldiers and Franciscan friars. 

After a half century of political jockeying in the region, the land finally came under the control of Juan Bautista Alvarado, governor of Mexico. On March 3, 1839, Alvarado granted of land in the area called &quot;Cucamonga&quot; to Tubercio Tapia, a first-generation Spanish native of Los Angeles, successful merchant, and notorious smuggler. Tapia went on to establish the first winery in California on his newly deeded land. Rancho Cucamonga was purchased by John Rains and his wife in 1858. The Rains family&#x27;s home, Casa de Rancho Cucamonga, was completed in 1860 and now appears on the National Register of Historic Places.

During the ensuing years the town prospered and grew. In 1887, irrigation tunnels were dug into Cucamonga Canyon by Chinese laborers and the Santa Fe Railroad was extended through the area. Among the town&#x27;s economic mainstays was agriculture, including olives, peaches, citrus, and, most notably, vineyards. In 1913, the Pacific Electric Railway was extended through Rancho Cucamonga in an effort to improve crop transportation. Several landmarks in existence today pay tribute to the city&#x27;s multicultural founding. In particular, Our Lady of Mt. Carmel remains as a relic of the area&#x27;s Mexican agriculture laborers while the Chinatown House stands as a reminder of the Chinese immigrants who labored in constructing the area&#x27;s infrastructure.

In 1977, the unincorporated communities of Alta Loma, Cucamonga, and Etiwanda voted to incorporate, forming the city of Rancho Cucamonga.

===Grapeland===
The former community of Grapeland, first settled in 1869, lay roughly between today&#x27;s Victoria Groves Park and Central Park. There was a schoolhouse which also doubled as a church. In 1890 an irrigation district was formed and $200,000 in bonds were sold to pay for improvements. The Sierra Vista reservoir was built in 1886-87 by J.L. Scofield as the focal point of a network of irrigation pipes. The system was unused, however, because the bond issue was declared illegal. &quot;Orchards and vineyards began to die,&quot; &quot;The Daily Report&quot; newspaper reported in a retrospective. &quot;Residents moved out. The post office closed in 1905. Homes, buildings were destroyed or abandoned.&quot; The reservoir remained unused until 1956, when the Fontana Union Water Company filled it with of water. The local school district was merged with the Etiwanda district in 1901. In 1957 the settlement was practically deserted, but there were still rabbit-proof stone walls marking boundaries of previous citrus orchards.

==Economy==
While most of the city&#x27;s land area is devoted to residential areas, Rancho Cucamonga, like its neighbors Ontario and Fontana, is a major center for the logistics industry in Southern California. This is due to its proximity to two interstate highways and Ontario International Airport, and the space afforded by the large tracts of former agricultural land in the southern section of the city.

In the area around Milliken Avenue, between Archibald and Etiwanda Avenues, Foothill Boulevard, and Fourth Street, about seven square miles of land are primarily occupied by numerous massive distribution centers, and even more, smaller manufacturing companies. This area is ringed by office parks, mostly along Haven Avenue, and shopping strips, such as the Terra Vista Town Center (part of a nearly two-square-mile master-planned community in the center of the city), and malls, such as Victoria Gardens, and the Ontario Mills, across Fourth Street in Ontario.

The city is also home to a CMC Steel (formerly Gerdau, formerly TAMCO Steel) minimill, the only producer of long steel in California. This mill recycles ferrous scrap, such as junked cars and appliances, to produce rebar.

The city hosts LoanMart Field (formerly known as The Epicenter), a minor-league baseball stadium, home of the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes. The Quakes&#x27; mascot, Tremor, is a &quot;Rallysaurus.&quot;

===Victoria Gardens===

Victoria Gardens is a lifestyle center near the eastern end of the city, at the intersection of Foothill and Day Creek Boulevards. Since the city had never developed a traditional commercial downtown like neighboring cities Ontario and Upland had, efforts were made in the design of Victoria Gardens to bring elements of more traditional and urban town design to what had historically been a suburban city. While retaining many characteristics of traditional shopping malls, such as large anchor stores, a food court, and vast parking lots and garages, the smaller stores are arranged as city blocks in a grid of two-lane streets, featuring lush landscaping and metered &quot;teaser parking&quot; in front of the stores, which open onto the sidewalk. There are two &quot;Main Streets&quot;, which run from west to east across the center. Running from north to south between them is a pedestrian axis leading from one of the Macy&#x27;s anchor stores, through a &quot;town square&quot; between a pair of mixed-use office buildings, to the Victoria Gardens Cultural Center, which contains the Lewis Playhouse (a 570-seat theater) and a branch of the city library. The east side of the development has Southern California&#x27;s first Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World superstore; the {{Convert|180000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility includes a Tracker Boat Center and the Islamorada Fish Company restaurant. There are restaurants throughout the center, both well-known chains and unique eateries. The center also features a 12-screen movie theater.

{{more citations needed|date=November 2010}}
===Transportation===
Rancho Cucamonga is served by Omnitrans bus service, train service from Metrolink&#x27;s Rancho Cucamonga station on the San Bernardino Line, and nearby Ontario International Airport, one of four major Los Angeles-area passenger airports with multiple daily flights by most domestic carriers as well as a major shipping hub for companies like UPS and FedEx.

Rancho Cucamonga has been identified as the initial western end-point of the Brightline West High Speed Rail (HSR) project to connect Southern California with Las Vegas. On December 5, 2023, it was announced that the project would be awarded a grant of USD3 Billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Interstate 15 (I-15) and State Route 210 (SR-210) run through Rancho Cucamonga as well as the historic U.S. Route 66 (as Foothill Boulevard).

I-15 sits atop an elevated berm, and cuts a curve through the southeastern part of the city, isolating a mostly industrial area, a small shopping center, and several housing tracts from the larger part of the city. Further north, I-15 forms part of the northeastern border with neighboring Fontana before entering the Cajon Pass through the San Gabriel Mountains. I-15 provides connectivity with the High Desert, Nevada, and points north for the Inland Empire and much of Southern California.

At {{cvt|640|MW}} net capacity, it was Reliant&#x27;s second-highest-capacity plant on the West Coast. It utilized four steam turbine generators; of which units three and four remained active after turbines one and two, as well as a combustion turbine, were retired in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Several systems are in place to control gas emissions, and annually, over {{cvt|900000000|USgal|impgal GL}} of recycled water are used for cooling. As of 2024, all turbines and stacks and the entire electrical plant have been removed.

On November 29, 2011, the Inland Empire Utilities Agency installed the first wind turbine in Rancho Cucamonga.

<doc id="108012" wikidata="Q753830" url="?curid=108012" title="Redlands, California">
<text>Redlands ( ) is a city in San Bernardino County, California, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 73,168, up from 68,747 at the 2010 census. The city is located approximately northwest of Palm Springs and east of Los Angeles.

Redlands was founded in 1881 on land that encompassed native Serrano, Morongo and Cahuilla tribes. Redlands absorbed the communities of Terracina, Barton, Gladysta, and Lugonia along with portions of Mentone, Crafton and Bryn Mawr when it incorporated in 1888. Redlands is home to the Asistencia Mission founded in 1819 by early European settlers. By the early 20th century, it was a major focal point of California&#x27;s citrus industry and boosted the world&#x27;s largest producer of naval oranges in the world.

Throughout its past, Redlands has a history of philanthropic residents establishing lasting legacies. The Smiley Library in 1898, the University of Redlands in 1907, the Redlands Bowl in 1924, the Lincoln Memorial Shrine in 1932 and the Redlands Bicycle Classic in 1985.
Today, Redlands is a strong growing community with a diverse economy, and growing population in the Inland Empire region of southern California. Redlands is home to Esri, Citrus Plaza, the Redlands Historical Glass Museum and the San Bernardino County Museum.

== History ==
The area now occupied by Redlands was previously part of the territory of the Morongo and Aguas Calientes tribes of Cahuilla people. Explorations such as those of Pedro Fages and Francisco Garcés sought to extend Catholic influence to the indigenous people and the dominion of the Spanish crown into the area in the 1770s. The Tongva village of Kaawchama, located just to the west of present-day Redlands, was visited by Fr. Francisco Dumetz in 1810, and was the reason the site was chosen for a mission outpost. Dumetz reached the village on May 20, the feast day of Saint Bernardino of Siena, and thus named the region the San Bernardino Valley. The Franciscan friars from Mission San Gabriel established the San Bernardino Asistencia in 1819 and embarked on the usual program of training the native tribes to raise crops and encouraging permanent settlements. By 1820, a ditch, known as a &quot;zanja&quot;, was dug by conscripted native labor for the friars from Mill Creek to the Asistencia. In 1822, word of the Mexican triumph in the War of Independence reached the inland area, and lands previously claimed by Spain passed to the custody of the newly established Mexican government.

===Lugonia and founding===
In 1842, the Lugo family bought the Rancho San Bernardino Mexican land grant and this became the first fixed settler civilization in the area. The area northwest of current Redlands, astride the Santa Ana River, would become known as Lugonia. The region was part of Alta California, a Mexican federal province until 1848, when it became part of the United States after the Mexican-American War. By 1850, California as a US state was established. The area received its first Anglo inhabitants in the form of several hundred Mormon pioneers, who purchased the entire &quot;Rancho San Bernardino&quot;, founded nearby San Bernardino, and established a prosperous farming community watered by the many lakes and streams of the San Bernardino Mountains. The Mormon community left wholesale in 1857, recalled to Utah by Brigham Young during the tensions with the US federal government that ultimately led to the brief Utah War. Benjamin Barton purchased from the Latter-Day Saints and planted extensive vineyards and built a winery.

&quot;The first settler on the site of the present Redlands is recorded to have erected a hut at the corner of what is now Cajon St. and Cypress Ave.; he was a sheep herder, and the year, 1865,&quot; reported Ira L. Swett in &quot;Tractions of the Orange Empire.&quot; Lugonia attracted settlers including, Barry Roberts in 1869, followed a year later by the Craw and Glover families. &quot;The first school teacher in Lugonia, George W. Beattie, arrived in 1874—shortly followed by the town&#x27;s first negro settler, Israel Beal.&quot;

In the 1880s, the arrival of the Southern Pacific and Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroads, connecting Southern California to San Francisco and Salt Lake triggered a land boom, with speculators such as John W. North flooding the area now known as the Inland Empire. North and others saw the area, with its hot, dry climate and ready access to water as an ideal center for citrus production. The city of Redlands was soon established by Frank E. Brown, a civil engineer, and E. G. Judson, a New York stock broker, to provide a center (along with North&#x27;s nearby settlement at Riverside) for the burgeoning citrus industry. They named their city &quot;Redlands&quot; after the color of the adobe soil. So large had the area grown by 1888 that it was decided to incorporate. &quot;A red-letter day in the Annals of Redlands,&quot; pronounced Scipio Craig, editor of &quot;The Citrograph&quot; newspaper, of the November 26 incorporation. The original communities of Lugonia, Bryn Mawr, Barton, Terracina, Gladysta, parts of Mentone, and parts of Crafton were absorbed at this time. The newspaper was first published in July 1887 by The Citrograph Printing Company, which remains in 2023 as both Redlands&#x27; oldest business and the longest-operating printing company in California. E. G. Judson served as the first mayor of Redlands.

===Railroads===
The Redlands Street Railway Company was incorporated on March 22, 1888, acquiring on June 5 a franchise from the San Bernardino County Supervisors dating to December 1887, conveying the right to construct, operate and maintain for a term of 50 years a line of street railways in Redlands, Terracina and vicinity. The initial operations began in June 1889 with a single-track line operating two-mule-team cars, the first street railway company of several to provide service to the community. Electrification and new rails replaced mules in 1899, with electrical operation beginning in December. Most Redlands street railways would pass to the San Bernardino Valley Traction Company in a consolidation on June 3, 1903, and thence to the Pacific Electric in the &quot;Great Merger&quot; of Huntington properties under new ownership by the Southern Pacific Transportation Company on February 8, 1911. Henry E. Huntington, nephew of late Southern Pacific president Collis P. Huntington, had gained control of the streetcar line of the Redlands Central Railway Company in 1908.

The Pacific Electric Railway (PE) completed an interurban connection between Los Angeles and San Bernardino in 1914, providing a convenient, speedy connection to the fast-growing city of Los Angeles and its new port at San Pedro, bringing greater prosperity to the town and a new role as a vacation destination for wealthy Angelenos. Redlands was the eastern terminus of the &quot;Big Red Car&quot; system. At its peak, PE operated five local routes in Redlands, with streetcars running to Smiley Heights and on Orange, Olive, and Citrus Avenues. Pacific Electric&#x27;s interurban service to Redlands was abandoned on July 20, 1936, with of track into the city lifted, although PE and Southern Pacific (parent company of PE) provided freight service as far as the Sunkist packing plant at Redlands Heights on San Bernardino Avenue into at least the 1970s. The Smiley Heights line was abandoned at this time, as well. Bus service operated by the Motor Transit Company, a subsidiary of Pacific Electric, began on July 20. This also affected mail delivery in Redlands as &quot;Approximately 80 percent of our mail from all directions arrives on the 5 a.m. electric car,&quot; explained Postmaster James B. Stone. &quot;This dispatch is sorted and morning deliveries started by 8:30 a.m. on most routes. The post office department has temporarily arranged for this mail to be brought in by the Santa Fe train at 6:05 a.m. As this arrival is an hour later, our service will be one hour later.&quot; The abandoned Pacific Electric La Quinta trestle over the Santa Ana River stood immediately south of San Bernardino International Airport into the 2010s but was removed when an Amazon facility was built adjacent to the site.

===Electricity===
&quot;History was made in the electrical industry July 27, 1892, when a franchise was granted to the Electric Light &amp; Power Co., which was incorporated Oct. 6 and began building a powerhouse in Mill Creek canyon. Thus the groundwork was laid for the world&#x27;s first (three)-phase transmission line, which brought electricity to Redlands and later became a unit in the Southern California Edison Co.&quot; The 250 kilowatt AC Mill Creek No. 1 Hydroelectric Plant was designed by Almirian Decker. Electric arc lamps were first illuminated over Redlands streets on August 5, 1893. George B. Ellis, one of seven men who spearheaded the undertaking, is largely credited with originating the plan.

&quot;The first line was extended from the Mill Creek powerhouse to East Citrus avenue, thence to Redlands and to Mr. Ellis&#x27; Terracina hotel. By September the company was advertising power for sale to the public. The firm boasted of ability to supply current enough for 55 arc lamps, and 1,500 homes.&quot; Engineer O. H. Ensign was &quot;largely responsible for the success of the undertaking.&quot; When gas lighting became available in Redlands in 1900, many homes already had electricity.

&quot;The same group of men in 1894 organized the Southern California Power Co. Later it was merged with the Edison Electric Co., of Los Angeles, a forerunner of the Southern California Edison Co.&quot;

===Citrus===
In the spring of 1882, Mr. E. J. Waite of Wisconsin planted the first orange grove in the city. For almost 75 years, the city was the center of the largest navel orange-producing region in the world. By the late 1930s, Redlands was a fruit-packing center surrounded by more than of citrus groves. The city produced more than 4,200 railcars of navel oranges and 1,300 cars of Valencia oranges during the 1937–38 growing season. During the 1930s and 1940s, labor activists campaigned in the canneries and packing houses for union representation and higher wages. The United Cannery, Agricultural, Packing, and Allied Workers of America (UCAPAWA) won 13 National Labor Relations Board representation elections in the Riverside-Redlands area in 1943. In 1945, the first annual Orange Queen Ball at the Redlands City Auditorium was held to raise funds for the union.

The citrus industry declined in the area as more agricultural areas were replaced by subdivisions, and all three citrus packing houses (two in downtown and one on San Bernardino Avenue) had closed by the end of the 1900s. Today only one packing house remains to serve the needs of approximately the of citrus that remains in production in the area.

===Community===
At the turn of the 20th century, Redlands was the &quot;Palm Springs&quot; of the next century, with roses being planted along many city thoroughfares. Some of these plantings would survive as wild thickets into the 1970s, especially adjacent to orange groves where property management was lax. Washingtonia palms (&quot;Washingtonia robusta&quot;) were planted along many main avenues. So beautifully kept was the area, with the dramatic mountain backdrops, that for several years the Santa Fe Railroad operated excursion trains along the loop that passed through the orange groves of Redlands and Mentone, across the Santa Ana River, and back into San Bernardino via East Highlands, Highlands and Patton, and advertised as the &quot;Kite Route&quot; due to its multi-sided alignment. The trestle over &quot;the Wash&quot; north of Mentone was carried away during a flood in March 1938 and never replaced, the line being truncated there. The Southern Pacific branch line from the San Timoteo Canyon to Crafton was abandoned after the downtown packing house business died. A thru-truss bridge over the &quot;Zanja&quot; (locally pronounced &quot;san-kee&quot;) exists today, abandoned in place. Burlington Northern Santa Fe, result of the AT&amp;SF-Burlington Northern merger, applied to abandon its San Bernardino-connected branch line east of downtown Redlands in 2007, the last shippers at Crafton and Mentone having ceased operations. A move was made by transit activists beginning in the 1990s to have this branch revitalized as part of the Southern California transit districts, but it came to nothing for many years. After Metrolink regional commuter rail became involved and funds secured, reconstruction began in 2019 and named Arrow. It was completed in 2022, a Metrolink branch from San Bernardino to end-of-track on the eastern side of town adjacent to the campus of the University of Redlands. 5 new stations with mostly local service to and from the San Bernardino Transit Center and one daily ride to Los Angeles Union Station.

The city has been visited by three U.S. Presidents: William McKinley was the first in 1901, followed by Theodore Roosevelt in 1903 and William Howard Taft in 1909. Local landmarks include the A.K. Smiley Public Library, a Moorish-style library built in 1898, and the Redlands Bowl, built in 1930 and home of the oldest continuously free outdoor concert series in the United States. Located behind the Smiley Library is the Lincoln Shrine, the only memorial honoring the &quot;Great Emancipator&quot;, the sixteenth president Abraham Lincoln, west of the Mississippi River. Famous homes include &quot;America&#x27;s Favorite Victorian,&quot; the Morey Mansion, on Terracina Boulevard, and the Kimberly Crest House and Gardens, a home museum featured on the PBS series &quot;America&#x27;s Castles.&quot; Named after the family that purchased the house, the owners of Kimberly-Clark (makers of paper goods and Kleenex), it is a beautiful mansion set high on a hill overlooking the whole valley. Redlands is still regarded as the &quot;Jewel of the Inland Empire.&quot;

In the mid-late 20th Century, Redlands was home to various light manufacturing firms, and became a bedroom community for the military personnel and contractor employees of the aerospace industry that supported missions at Norton Air Force Base, as well as the Lockheed Propulsion Company plant in Mentone.

Prior to European colonization, local tongva Serrano people practiced spirituality for millennia, web of life customs. The first known monothistic religious establishment in Redlands, was of the Christian faith. The catholic San Bernardino de Sena Estancia by Francisco Dumetz was established in 1819 on the feast day of Saint Bernardine. Part of an outpost of the Mission San Gabriel Arcángel located 56 miles from Los Angeles, CA., a days trip walking. This outpost, was used to convert local native Tongva, Serrano, and Cahuilla Native Americans to christianity. With Spanish colonization and the subsequent Mexican era, San Bernardino Valley was a sparsely populated land grant rancho, considering it unsuitable for an actual mission. The estancia was later sold to José del Carmen Lugo who made it his home in 1842. The Catholic presence remains with the Holy Name of Jesus Catholic Church and the Discalced Carmelite Friars retreat compound established in 1952. Known as The Carmelo Retreat House.

Rich, establishing a Mormon colony in nearby San Bernardino, CA. Mormon presence remains in Redlands after the property was sold to Dr. Ben Barton in the late 1850s.

<text>Rialto is a city in San Bernardino County, California, United States, 56 miles east of Los Angeles, near the Cajon Pass, Interstate 15, Interstate 10, State Route 210 and Metrolink routes.

Its population was 104,026 as of the 2020 census, up from 99,171 at the 2010 census. Its population and economic activity have grown rapidly in recent years due to the building of major distribution centers in the region.

Rialto is home to major regional distribution centers: Staples Inc., which serves stores across the entire West Coast of the United States, Amazon, Under Armour, Medline Industries, Niagara Bottling, Monster Energy and Target in the northern region of the city, in the Las Colinas community. One of the United States&#x27; largest fireworks companies, Pyro Spectaculars, is also headquartered in Rialto.

==History==

Ancient artifacts discovered by archaeologists suggest that what is now the city of Rialto was settled prior to 1500. Such artifacts, now found at the Rialto Historical Society, indicate that the Serrano Indians lived in the Rialto area between 1500 and 1800 AD.

An adobe building from the early 19th century, which has been used for many purposes over the years, is the oldest building still standing in Rialto and stands restored near Bud Bender Park, formerly known as &quot;Lilac Park&quot; on Second Street and Riverside Avenue.

In 1842, the Lugo family was granted the Rancho San Bernardino—a holding of 37,700 acres—which encompassed Rialto. In 1851, the Mountain Family purchased part of the Lugo family&#x27;s Rancho San Bernardino, and claimed several other portions of the ranch which later became known as Rialto. This claim was later amended by the United States Government, permitting them a smaller fraction of the initial purchase.

In 1887 a railroad connector line was built between San Bernardino and Pasadena by the Santa Fe Railroad. Along the line, townsites were located every [mile and a half] and by the fall of that year over 25 new towns were being built. This same year the Semitropic Land and Water Company was formed to organize the purchase and selling of real estate, water, and water rights and privileges. A Methodist colony developed which was named after the Rialto Bridge in Venice, Italy, considered a central meeting place for Venetians.

In the fall of 1888, the first school was built and Brooke School District was formed. Records show that up until 1920, the Brooke School District was in continuous operation, except for a very short time in 1888. The prominent Rialto Trapp family bought the first school house in 1921, remodeled the building, and members of the family resided in it until it was destroyed by fire. The Rialto School District (today Rialto Unified School District), was formed in 1891. The staff consisted of two teachers and a principal with separate play areas for the boys and girls.

In 1901 a cemetery was established in the township. It is administered by the City Treasurer.

The Chamber of Commerce was established in 1907. The Chamber incorporated in the spring of 1911. By 1911 the population had grown to 1,500 with 40 businesses and a local newspaper. The election results on October 31 of the same year were 135 votes for the incorporation of the city and 72 against.

Foothill Boulevard was repaired in 1913 and became U.S. Route 66, a section of the U.S. highway system. In 1914 Los Angeles&#x27; Pacific Electric Railway completed its San Bernardino Line through the City of Rialto, with a junction at Riverside Avenue for the Riverside Line. Today the Tracks above First Street are a part of the Union Pacific and the Pacific Electric depot on Riverside Avenue is Cuca&#x27;s Restaurant.

A fire in the 1920s swept through and destroyed many of the buildings in the downtown area.

The U.S. Army Rialto Ammunition Storage point which was used during World War II to support operations in the Pacific theater. The was operated between 1941-1945 and the land later sold to defense contractors and private corporations. The site is a Superfund Site that was scheduled to begin remediation in 2020.

In the late 1990s, the city&#x27;s drinking water was contaminated by perchlorate leaking from a site owned by a defense contractors and fireworks manufacturer that handles perchlorate salts and hazardous materials. The city launched lawsuits against 42 parties. The United States Environmental Protection Agency designed a groundwater pump and treatment system to remove and clean contaminated water, and negotiated settlements to several lawsuits. Cleanup costs reached $100 million in 2014, and a pumping station was estimated to begin treating contaminated water between 2020 and 2021.

Running Springs is a member community of the Rim of the World, an inhabited stretch of the San Bernardino Mountains and wholly contained in the San Bernardino National Forest. The Rim (as it is locally known) extends from Crestline to Big Bear, a distance of some . Running Springs is served by Rim of the World High School and Mary Putnam Henck Intermediate School situated in Lake Arrowhead.

Logging in the San Bernardino Mountains was once done on a large scale, with the Brookings Lumber Company operation the largest. It operated on between Fredalba and Hunsaker Flats (present-day Running Springs), and extending northward to Heap&#x27;s Ranch and Lightningdale (near Green Valley Lake) between 1899 and 1912. It built a logging railroad to bring logs to the mill at Fredalba. The Shay locomotives had to be disassembled and hauled by wagon up the mountain, since the railroad operated in the high country but did not connect to other railroads in the lowlands. About 60% of the finished lumber was hauled by wagon down the steep grades to the Molino box factory in Highland, which made packing crates for the citrus grown in the area. The remaining 40% went to the company&#x27;s retail lumber yard in San Bernardino. In 1912, the company dismantled the Fredalba sawmill and moved much of the machinery to Brookings, Oregon.

==Star house and Community==
Beginning in 1958, a private residence directly north of Euclid Avenue in San Antonio Heights displayed an enormous five-point star of lights each holiday season. Traditionally the 35-foot star was lit each night between Thanksgiving and New Year&#x27;s Day and was visible for miles throughout the Pomona Valley.

The star and the two-story home to which it was attached were destroyed October 25, 2003 in the Grand Prix Fire that swept through the area. More than $20,000 was raised to assist the property owner in rebuilding the star, so a temporary replacement measuring 65 feet tall was erected with a crane during the 2003-2005 holiday seasons. The star was not lit in 2006 after its copper wiring was stolen from the site. Because of this, hundreds of residents of San Antonio Heights purchased smaller stars that year and put those on their houses during the holiday season. It&#x27;s a tradition that has continued.

Ken Petschow, a commercial airline pilot who owns the property, lit the star again beginning in 2007.

The community holds three annual events: A pancake breakfast on the weekend preceding Memorial Day, a Steakfest in mid-September—both at San Antonio Park—and a Holiday Sing-Along on Christmas Eve at Local Fire Station 12.

<text>San Bernardino ( ) is a city in and the county seat of San Bernardino County, California, United States. Located in the Inland Empire region of Southern California, the city had a population of 222,101 in the 2020 census, making it the 18th-largest city in California. San Bernardino is the economic, cultural, and political hub of the San Bernardino Valley and the Inland Empire. The governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Mexico have established the metropolitan area&#x27;s only consulates in the downtown area of the city. Additionally, San Bernardino serves as an anchor city to the 3rd largest metropolitan area in California (after Los Angeles and San Francisco) and the 12th largest metropolitan area in the United States; the San Bernardino–Riverside MSA. Furthermore, the city&#x27;s University District serves as a college town, as home to California State University, San Bernardino.

San Bernardino was named in 1810, when Spanish priest Francisco Dumetz led an expedition through the area. In 1839, the Mexican government granted Californio ranchero José del Carmen Lugo the right to settle the area, which was formalized when he was granted Rancho San Bernardino in 1842. Following the American Conquest of California, the community on the rancho was incorporated as a city in 1854. The city grew significantly in the late 19th century as a commercial hub at the crossroads between Southern California and the American Southwest. Today, San Bernardino is an important hub for the Inland Empire and Southern California.

==History==

=== Indigenous ===
The city of San Bernardino, California, occupies much of the San Bernardino Valley, a valley long inhabited by the Tongva. Several of their villages dotted the San Bernardino valley prior to the arrival of Europeans in the valley. Kaawchama was perhaps the most significant in the region, being a regional center for trade that was connected to villages in Southern California and the Colorado River through the Mohave Trail, that was used by the Mohave, Serrano, Cahuilla, Payomkawichum, and others. The village was located in the eastern expanse of Tovaangar, and was established along the Santa Ana River.

===Spanish and Mexican era===
With the establishment of Mission San Gabriel in 1771, Spanish missionaries traveling through the area expressed a desire to establish a supply station in the area, which became the Guachama Rancheria. The settlement was also referred to as Politana and became the first Spanish settlement in what they referred to as San Bernardino Valley, named for Bernardino of Siena, being established in 1810 as a mission chapel and supply station by the Mission San Gabriel.

Two years later the settlement was destroyed by local tribesmen, following powerful earthquakes that shook the region. Several years later, the Serrano and Mountain Cahuilla rebuilt the Guachama Rancheria, and in 1819 invited the missionaries to return to the valley. They did and established the San Bernardino de Sena Estancia. Serrano and Cahuilla people inhabited Politana until long after the 1830s decree of secularization and the 1842 inclusion into the Rancho San Bernardino land grant of the José del Carmen Lugo family.

===Post-Conquest era===
The area was not largely settled until 1851, following the American Conquest of California. The first Anglo-American colony was established by pioneers associated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Following the Mormon colonists&#x27; purchase of Rancho San Bernardino, and the establishment of the town of San Bernardino in 1851, San Bernardino County was formed in 1853 from parts of Los Angeles County. Mormons laid out the town based on the &quot;City of Zion&quot; plan which was typical of Mormon urban planning. Mormon colonists developed irrigated, commercial farming and lumbering, supplying agricultural produce and lumber throughout Southern California.

The city was officially incorporated in 1857. Later that year, most of the colonists were recalled by Brigham Young in 1857 due to the Utah War. Once highly regarded in early California, news of the Mountain Meadows Massacre poisoned attitudes toward the Mormons. Some Mormons would stay in San Bernardino and some later returned from Utah, but a real estate consortium from El Monte and Los Angeles bought most of the lands of the old rancho and of the departing colonists. They sold these lands to new settlers who came to dominate the culture and politics in the county and San Bernardino became a typical American frontier town. Many of the new land owners disliked the sober Mormons, indulging in drinking at saloons now allowed in the town. Disorder, fighting and violence in the vicinity became common, reaching a climax in the 1859 Ainsworth - Gentry Affair.

In 1860 a gold rush began in the mountains nearby with the discovery of gold by William F. Holcomb in Holcomb Valley early 1860. Another strike followed in the upper reach of Lytle Creek. By the 1860s, San Bernardino had also become an important trading hub in Southern California. The city already on the Los Angeles – Salt Lake Road, became the starting point for the Mojave Road from 1858 and Bradshaw Trail from 1862 to the mines along the Colorado River and within the Arizona Territory in the gold rush of 1862–1864.

Near San Bernardino is a naturally formed arrowhead-shaped rock formation on the side of a mountain. It measures 1375 feet by 449 feet. According to the Native American legend regarding the landmark arrowhead, an arrow from Heaven burned the formation onto the mountainside in order to show tribes where they could be healed. During the mid-19th century, &quot;Dr.&quot; David Noble Smith claimed that a saint-like being appeared before him and told of a far-off land with exceptional climate and curative waters, marked by a gigantic arrowhead. Smith&#x27;s search for that unique arrowhead formation began in Texas, and eventually ended at Arrowhead Springs in California in 1857.

By 1889, word of the springs, along with the hotel on the site (and a belief in the effect on general health of the water from the springs) had grown considerably. Hotel guests often raved about the crystal-clear water from the cold springs, which prompted Seth Marshall to set up a bottling operation in the hotel&#x27;s basement. By 1905, water from the cold springs was being shipped to Los Angeles under the newly created &quot;Arrowhead&quot; trademark.

Indigenous people of the San Bernardino Valley and Mountains were collectively identified by Spanish explorers in the 19th century as Serrano, a term meaning highlander. Serrano living near what is now Big Bear Lake were called Yuhaviatam, or &quot;People of the Pines&quot;. In 1866, to clear the way for settlers and gold miners, state militia conducted a 32-day campaign slaughtering men, women, and children. Yuhaviatam leader Santos Manuel guided his people from their ancient homeland to a village site in the San Bernardino foothills. The United States government in 1891 established it as a tribal reservation and named it after Santos Manuel.

In 1867, the first Chinese immigrants arrived in San Bernardino.

In 1883, California Southern Railroad established a rail link through San Bernardino between Los Angeles and the rest of the country.

===Modern era===

In 1905, the city of San Bernardino passed its first charter.

Norton Air Force Base was established during World War II. In 1994, Norton Air Force Base closed to become San Bernardino International Airport.

In 1940, Richard and Maurice McDonald founded McDonald&#x27;s, along with its innovative restaurant concept, in the city.

In 1955, Glen Bell started his first taco stand after learning from Gloria Hoyle at Mitla Café, later developing into the first Taco Bell.

San Bernardino won the All-America City award in 1977.

On May 12, 1989, a massive derailment took place along Duffy street at the Muscoy area, killing 4 people and destroying seven homes. Then on May 25, an underground petroleum pipeline ruptured, killing 2 more people and burning down 11 more homes.

In August 2012, San Bernardino filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, with more than $1 billion in debt. The move froze the city&#x27;s payments to creditors, including its pension payments to the California Public Employees&#x27; Retirement System for nearly a year. San Bernardino became the largest city at the time to file for a Chapter 9 bankruptcy, superseded by Detroit&#x27;s filing in July 2013. Following a judge&#x27;s approval, the city emerged from bankruptcy in February 2017, making it one of the longest municipal bankruptcies in the United States.

On December 2, 2015, a terrorist attack left 14 people dead and 22 seriously injured.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.74%, is water.

The city lies in the San Bernardino foothills and the eastern portion of the San Bernardino Valley, roughly east of Los Angeles. Some major geographical features of the city include the San Bernardino Mountains and the San Bernardino National Forest, in which the city&#x27;s northernmost neighborhood, Arrowhead Springs, is located. At the base of the mountains lies the San Andreas Fault, which passes through the northern areas of the city, and where several smaller faults lie in close proximity. The Cajon Pass adjacent to the northwest border; City Creek, Lytle Creek, San Timoteo Creek, Twin Creek, Warm Creek (as modified through flood control channels) feed the Santa Ana River, which forms part of the city&#x27;s southern border south of San Bernardino International Airport. The city has several notable hills and mountains; among them are Perris Hill (named after Fred Perris, an early engineer, and the namesake of Perris, California); Kendall Hill (which is near California State University); and Little Mountain, which rises among Shandin Hills (generally bounded by Sierra Way, 30th Street, Kendall Drive, and Interstate 215).

San Bernardino is unique among Southern Californian cities because of its wealth of water, which is mostly contained in underground aquifers.

Seccombe Lake, named after a former mayor, is a manmade lake at Sierra Way and 5th Street.

===Climate===

San Bernardino features a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot; in the Köppen climate classification) with warm winters and hot, dry summers. Relative to other areas in Southern California, winters are colder, with frost and with chilly to cold morning temperatures common. The particularly arid climate during the summer prevents tropospheric clouds from forming, meaning temperatures rise to what is considered by NOAA scientists as Class Orange. Summer thus has temperatures approaching those typical of hot desert climates, with the highest recorded summer temperature at on July 6, 2018. In the winter, snow flurries occur upon occasion. San Bernardino gets an average of of rain, hail, or light snow showers each year. Arrowhead Springs, San Bernardino&#x27;s northernmost neighborhood gets snow, heavily at times, due to its elevation of about above sea level.

The seasonal Santa Ana winds are felt particularly strongly in the San Bernardino area as warm and dry air is channeled through nearby Cajon Pass at times during the autumn months. This phenomenon markedly increases the wildfire danger in the foothills, canyon, and mountain communities that the cycle of cold, wet winters and dry summers helps create.

===Ethnic diversity===

Western, central, and parts of eastern San Bernardino are home to mixed-ethnic working class populations, of which the Latino and African-American populations comprise the vast majority of the city. Historically, many Latinos, primarily Mexican-Americans and Mexicans, lived on Mount Vernon Avenue on the West Side. Since the 1960s, the Medical Center (formerly known as Muscoy) and Base Line corridors were mostly black, in particular in the east side and west side areas centering on public housing projects Waterman Gardens and the public housing on Medical Center drive. The heart of the Mexican-American community is on the West and Southside of San Bernardino, but is slowly expanding throughout the entire city. San Bernardino&#x27;s only Jewish congregation moved to Redlands in December 2009.
Some Asian Americans live in and around the city of San Bernardino, as in a late 19th-century-era (gone) Chinatown and formerly Japanese-American area in Seccombe Park on the east end of downtown, and a large East-Asian community in North Loma Linda. Others live in nearby Loma Linda to the south across the Santa Ana River. Filipinos are the largest Asian ethnic group in San Bernardino.

==Economy==
The city&#x27;s location close to the Cajon and San Gorgonio passes, and at the junctions of the I-10, I-215, and SR-210 freeways, positions it as an intermodal logistics hub. The city hosts the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway&#x27;s intermodal freight transport yard, the Yellow Freight Systems&#x27; cross-docking trucking center, and Pacific Motor Trucking. Large warehouses for Kohl&#x27;s, Mattel, Pep Boys, and Stater Bros. have been developed near the San Bernardino International Airport.

The closing of Norton Air Force Base in 1994 resulted in the loss of 10,000 military and civilian jobs and sent San Bernardino&#x27;s economy into a downturn that has been somewhat offset by more recent growth in the intermodal shipping industry. The jobless rate in the region rose to more than 12 percent during the years immediately after the base closing. As of 2007 households within one mile of the city core had a median income of only $20,480, less than half that of the Inland region as a whole. Over 15 percent of San Bernardino residents are unemployed as of 2012, and over 40 percent are on some form of public assistance. According to the US Census, 34.6 percent of residents lived below the poverty level in 2012, making San Bernardino the poorest city for its population in California, and the second poorest in the United States after Detroit.

<text>The Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC), also known as 29 Palms, is the largest United States Marine Corps base. The base covers a total area of 1,102 square miles.

It was a census-designated place (CDP) officially known as Twentynine Palms Base located adjacent to the city of Twentynine Palms in southern San Bernardino County, California. As of the 2000 census, the base had a total population of 8,413. The Zip Code of the base is 92278; base housing&#x27;s zip code is 92277. The CDP was discontinued prior to the 2010 census.

== History ==
From 1942 through July 1944, during World War II, the airfield at Twentynine Palms was utilized by the U.S. Army Air Force for primary flight training. What is now the &quot;Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center&quot; was taken over by the Eleventh Naval District, headquartered in San Diego, as Naval Auxiliary Air Station Twentynine Palms, in July 1944. After the war, its future was uncertain. Then, on August 20, 1952, Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton Headquarters issued Post Order 343 creating the Marine Corps Training Center, Twentynine Palms.

During the Korean War, it became obvious that more live-fire training ranges were needed. Pendleton&#x27;s Marines looked to the abandoned Condor Field, a World War II Army and Navy glider base located in the vicinity of what is now mainside. The base was designated on February 6, 1953, as Marine Corps Training Center, Twentynine Palms. By February 1, 1957, it grew to base status and was designated as Marine Corps Base, Twentynine Palms, Calif.

Only 70 Marines comprised the detachment at the center. Manned by Marines from Camp Pendleton, its primary mission was to prepare the new base for the arrival of permanent personnel. By mid-December, 1952, a fresh 3rd Marine Division, with assistance from the 12th Marine Regiment, conducted the first large-scale, live-fire field exercise aboard the base. The exercise gave Marines a glimpse of the facility&#x27;s potential and foreshadowed the large-scale combined arms exercises for which the base is known.

In 1976, under the command of Brigadier General Ernest R. Reid Jr., work began to add an expeditionary airfield to the base&#x27;s growing infrastructure. Following completion of the expeditionary airfield, its name was changed to Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Training Center on October 1, 1978, and changed yet once more to Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC) on February 16, 1979. It was also during this time that plans for the combined arms exercises were conceived. Supplanting an earlier exercise known as Desert Palm Tree, the new combined arms exercises were remarkable in two respects: the practice of combined arms, and live-fire and movement during the exercises were unprecedented in scale. Just as noteworthy was the creation of a Tactical Exercise Control Center with the primary purpose of controlling, instructing and critiquing the exercises. In the words of base historian, Colonel Verle E. Ludwig, &quot;Twentynine Palms was to be a permanent &#x27;combined-arms exercise college&#x27; for all of the Marine Corps.&quot;

On October 1, 2000, after 21 years as MCAGCC, the command was designated as Marine Air Ground Task Force Training Command, Twentynine Palms, California. This designation accompanied a change in policy that placed MAGTF Training Command under the auspices of Training and Education Command, Headquarters Marine Corps, MCCDC, Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. The expeditionary airfield and surrounding accommodations for visiting units was named &quot;Camp Wilson&quot;.

The base is currently home to one of the largest military training areas in the nation. The program known as Mojave Viper has become the model of pre-Operation Iraqi Freedom deployment training. The majority of units in the Marine Corps deploying to Iraq were trained at Mojave Viper or a mixed training venue using the Mountain Warfare Training Center (south of Lake Tahoe) for Afghanistan. Live fire exercises, artillery, tank, and close air support training are used for training, in addition to the sprawling &quot;Combat Town,&quot; a fabricated Middle Eastern village, complete with a mosque, native role-players, an &quot;IED Alley,&quot; and other immersive touches.

In August 2008, the Marine Corps submitted a land withdrawal application to the Bureau of Land Management for approximately contiguous to base as part of an ongoing study by the Marine Corps for possible base expansion, along with the establishment of corresponding special-use airspace, necessary to train a Marine expeditionary brigade at the Combat Center.

== Geography ==
Twentynine Palms Base is located within the Morongo Basin and the High Desert region of the Mojave Desert in Southern California. MCAGCC Twentynine Palms is approximately 98 miles from the Marine Corps Logistics Base Barstow, Barstow, California. It is approximately 111 miles from the Barstow-Daggett Airport in Daggett, California.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the base has a total area of . This area is all land with none covered by water. This area covers only the main cantonment, which includes the base housing; the entire installation is far larger, with of surface area, all land. There was a resident population of 14,090 on this territory as of the 2000 census.

The terrain is consistent, with steeply sloped mountains and flat valleys running northwest–southeast, with elevations ranging from 1,800 to above sea level. The training area is also characterized with ancient lava flows, as well as dry lake beds and arroyos (or wadis) that fill quickly during rain, presenting the danger of powerful floods and washouts that can move armored vehicles. Many abandoned mines dot the terrain, as well as unexploded ordnance and shrapnel, making unauthorized travel in the training areas dangerous.

The climate is described best as arid and upland desert. Summer temperatures can peak at 120 °F and bottom at 15 °F in the winter, with an annual average of 67 °F. Precipitation averages annually, most often in the fall and winter months. Weather is generally clear and sunny with low humidity.

<text>Victorville is a city in Victor Valley in San Bernardino County, California. Its population as of the 2020 census was 134,810.

Victorville is the principal city of a Victor Valley–based urban area defined by the United States Census Bureau: the Victorville–Hesperia–Apple Valley urban area had a population of 355,816 as of the 2020 census, making it the 117th largest in the United States.

==History==
The Serrano people were the first Native Americans to inhabit the area.

In 1858, Aaron G. Lane came to what is now known as Victorville and founded a waystation called &quot;Lane&#x27;s Crossing.&quot; For many years it provided shelter and supplies for people journeying across the desert from the east to San Bernardino. Lane&#x27;s Crossing was on the Mojave River on today&#x27;s Turner Road, two miles north of where Interstate 15 crosses the river. Lane was a veteran of the Mexican–American War who had had malaria during that war. Originally he migrated west to join the California gold rush, but he learned that he could make a better living selling supplies to the miners.

Lane settled in Ione, near Sutter&#x27;s Mill in northern California, during those years, but migrated to San Bernardino in 1857. He settled on the Mojave River in 1858, where he established his waystation. He later sold out to Texan John Fry Miller, who changed the name of Lane&#x27;s Crossing to Pioneer Station. Miller was a rancher and became involved in Mojave Valley politics, setting up the first polling place in the area at his home. That first year, ten citizens cast their votes at Lane&#x27;s residence rather than making the long trip to San Bernardino.

Census records show that ten people lived in two residences on the river by 1860. Listed in Dwelling No. 703 were Aaron Lane, William R. Levick, and the Nicholson family, consisting of George, Frances, and their three children aged 9 to 13. Joseph and Mary Highmoor lived in Dwelling No. 704, with a seven-year-old girl named Anna.

The Levick, Nicholson and Highmoor families were Mormon pioneers. Highmoor established a way station called Highmoor&#x27;s Crossing near today&#x27;s Oro Grande bridge of the National Trails Highway (known as U.S. Route 66), over the Mojave River at what is called the Lower Narrows. The Nicholson family moved downriver a few miles and established a way station at &quot;Point of Rocks&quot; in today&#x27;s Helendale area.

In 1867, Lafayette Meacham, a Mormon who ran a way station near today&#x27;s Barstow area, made a new wagon road from his stage stop to what is now Old Town Victorville. It crossed the Mojave River at today&#x27;s Sixth Street. This new road, now called Stoddard Wells Road, was a shortcut across the desert and became a popular route for muleskinners and freighters. The river crossing was called Mormon Crossing and the surrounding area became known by that name.

In the 1870s, Heber &quot;Pete&quot; Huntington established a stage stop, Huntington Station, at Mormon Crossing. Also a Mormon pioneer, Huntington was leader Brigham Young&#x27;s nephew. Huntington later bought out the Stoddard brothers, who had a waystation halfway to today&#x27;s Barstow from Victorville, and the Meachams, who ran the stage stop named Fish Ponds or Mormon Grocery.

In 1885, the newly established telegraph station at the railroad siding of &quot;Victor&quot;, named for the California Southern Railroad&#x27;s General Manager Jacob Nash Victor, was the beginning of what developed as today&#x27;s Old Town Victorville. The village that sprang up around that railroad facility became known by the same name of Victor.

In 1901, at the suggestion of local postmistress Abbey Turner, the U.S. Post Office Department changed that name to Victorville to stop the postal confusion with the town of Victor, Colorado.

In 1926, U.S. Route 66 was begun, being marked in many areas on existing roads. In Victorville, US 66 is marked on D and Seventh streets, with a section of Interstate 15 going towards the Cajon Pass. It is the primary street through Old Town Victorville.

In 1940, Herman J. Mankiewicz and John Houseman wrote the first two drafts of the screenplay for the film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; in Victorville. They worked in seclusion for 12 weeks while residing at the North Verde Ranch, now called the Kemper Campbell Ranch. The quiet ranch allowed Mankiewicz to complete his writing without the temptation of drinking, as he struggled with alcoholism.

The Victorville Army Airfield was constructed beginning in 1941. It was renamed the George Air Force Base when the U.S. Air Force was established in October 1947. After decades of service to the Air Force, in 1992 George Air Force Base was closed. Its land was turned over to other uses. Part of it is now the Southern California Logistics Airport. The former Air Force base housing area is now vacant. It forms a ghost town used for military training by troops from the U.S. Army&#x27;s Fort Irwin Military Reservation. The Victorville Federal Penitentiary has been built on another part of the former air base.

The city of Victorville was officially incorporated by the State of California on September 21, 1962.

In 2003, the Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Museum was moved from Victorville to Branson, Missouri. It closed before 2015.

On November 3, 2007, Victorville hosted the DARPA Urban Challenge, a six-hour autonomous robot driving contest through the streets of the Southern California Logistics Airport. The $2 million first prize went to the Carnegie Mellon University team.

==Geography==
Victorville is located at the southwestern edge of the Mojave Desert, northeast of Los Angeles, north of San Diego, southwest of Las Vegas, south of Barstow, east of Palmdale, and north of San Bernardino through the Cajon Pass on Interstate 15. Victorville is the location of offices of the &quot;Mojave Desert Branch&quot; of the San Bernardino County government.

Victorville is bordered by Apple Valley on the east, Hesperia on the south, and Adelanto on the west. The Mojave River flows sporadically through Victorville. The elevation at City Hall is approximately above sea level.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of it is land and of it is water. The total area is 0.76% water.

===Climate===
The city is in the High Desert, an area known for its unique and moderate weather patterns. The National Weather Service has maintained a weather station in Victorville since 1917. Official records show that Victorville has a cool arid climate (Köppen &quot;BWk&quot;) with four distinct seasons. Due to the higher elevation and inland location of the High Desert, the climate tends to be more extreme than in the Los Angeles Basin and other Southern California lowland regions.

Winter is the region&#x27;s wet season, when Victorville receives the most storms. Due to the rain shadow effect caused by the San Bernardino Mountains and San Gabriel Mountains, the rainfall received is less than in the Los Angeles basin or even the San Bernardino Valley. Temperatures tend to be cool, with overnight low temperatures dropping to or below freezing on average. While the high temperatures average around a pleasant , there are periods in which the high temperature fails to reach or even . Low temperatures can dip below on occasion, with very cold temperatures possible; the record lowest temperature was . Snowfall and other wintry precipitation is also possible, although any snowfall tends to be very light and melt quickly; significant snowstorms as seen in the San Bernardino Mountains and San Gabriel Mountains are very rare. Black ice is also possible during the winter.

Summer days are generally hot to sweltering, with average high temperatures approaching . It is also the time of year in which Victorville, and Southern California as a whole, receives the least precipitation. The higher elevation prevents the temperatures from matching the extreme heat seen in lower desert cities such as Palm Springs or Needles. However, heat waves can still raise the temperature to , with the all-time record high being . Also unlike lower desert communities, the diurnal temperature variation is greater, allowing substantial relief to occur at night with average low temperatures approaching . In the later part of the season, the average precipitation amount experiences an uptick due to the North American Monsoon bringing possible thunderstorms to the region. These thunderstorms can cause flash flooding, lightning, hail, and bring relief from the very hot summer days.

Spring is a transitional season, with warm high temperatures and low temperatures remaining quite cool. Summer-like weather usually begins to appear in May while rainfall tapers off. Autumn also has generally warm to very warm high temperatures on average, with temperatures falling from hot in September to pleasant in November, and rainfall rates increasing. Winter-like weather usually begins to appear by late November. High wind events are common in Victorville year-round and particularly during the spring; they can down power lines and cause dust storms that reduce visibility.

There are an average of 109 days with highs of or higher and an average of 79 days with lows of or lower. The average annual rainfall in Victorville is . There is an average of 28 days annually with measurable rain. The wettest “rain year” recorded was from July 1982 to June 1983 with and the driest from July 1960 to June 1961 with . The most precipitation in one month was in February 1944. The most precipitation in 24 hours was on February 24, 1998. Snowfall in Victorville averages only annually. The most snowfall in one month was in January 1949, including on January 14.

<text>Wrightwood is a census-designated place in San Bernardino County, California. It sits at an elevation of . The population was 4,525 at the 2010 census, up from the population of 3,837 at the 2000 census. Wrightwood is located northeast of Los Angeles. It is on the Pacific Crest Trail.

==History==
Located in a pine-covered valley in the San Gabriel Mountains, the Wrightwood area was first developed as cattle ranches in the 19th century by Nathan and Truman Swarthout. Later, the main ranch, owned by Sumner Wright, was broken up into residential and commercial lots, and by the 1920s a community had taken root. Early ski enthusiasts discovered the north-facing slopes of the San Gabriels above the Swarthout Valley. Until 1937, the ski area, originally known as Big Pines, was part of a Los Angeles County park. After World War II, Big Pines opened their 1946–47 ski season with a new chairlift and the Sepp Benedikter Ski School (according to their ad in the February 1947 issue of &quot;Western Skiing&quot; magazine). Highways were built connecting to the major routes in the Cajon Pass, making Wrightwood accessible without serious mountain driving.

In 1934, on two separate occasions a black bear was shot and killed by a Wrightwood resident. J. Dale Gentry, chairman of the California Fish and Game Commission, applied pressure to file charges against the two men. One of the men, Clyde Steele, was found not guilty at trial; the charges were dropped against the other man.

The former vacation community is now home to over 4,000 full-time residents. Serrano High School in the neighboring community of Phelan opened in 1982; it also serves Wrightwood and the neighboring community of Piñon Hills.

In August 2016, part of Wrightwood&#x27;s population was evacuated as part of mandatory evacuations of over 82,000 people in San Bernardino County due to the Blue Cut Fire. In September 2020, the Bobcat Fire caused evacuation warnings for the Wrightwood area as it raged across the San Gabriel Mountains. In September 2024, the Bridge Fire caused the entire town to be evacuated.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , 99.94% of it land and 0.06% of it water. The climate is Mediterranean (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;) influenced by its highland position. Summers are vastly moderated by the cooling down of the air at the higher elevation compared to the hot plains to its north and the San Bernardino Valley to the south, although share the similar dry features and a lack of summer thunderstorms. In winter, the Mediterranean tendencies of the more semi-arid lowland areas are exaggerated by orographic lift, causing precipitation comparable to areas much further north in California. However, due to the elevation, a lot of winter precipitation falls as snow. Even so, daytime highs year-round average above freezing, rendering snowpacks unstable and unreliable.

<text>Yucaipa (Serrano: &quot;Yukaipa&#x27;t&quot;) is a city located east of San Bernardino, in San Bernardino County, California, United States. The population was 54,542 at the 2020 census, up from 51,367 at the 2010 census. Yucaipa has the distinction of being the longtime home to a large population of Serrano Native Americans.

== History ==
Prior to the Spanish colonization of the Americas and the arrival of European settlers from Mexico, the Yucaipa Valley was known as &quot;Yukaipa&#x27;t&quot;, which meant &quot;green valley&quot; in the Serrano American Language. The land was home to the Serrano Native Americans for thousands of years. Today, some of their descendants are enrolled in the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians.

===Yucaipa Rancheria===
Yucaipa Valley supported a large population of Serrano Native Americans. The fertile valley was watered by springs and creeks running out of the San Bernardino Mountains. The Serrano Americans lived in this location most of the year, but would make excursions into the mountains to gather acorns and other food items during their harvest season. The Rancheria is marked by California Historical Landmark #620.

===Yucaipa Adobe===
Near the Rancheria is the Yucaipa Adobe, which is believed to be the oldest house in San Bernardino County. Diego Sepúlveda, nephew of Antonio María Lugo, built the Adobe in 1842 on land that was part of the Rancho San Bernardino granted in 1842 to the Lugos. It had formerly been land controlled by San Gabriel Mission. The Rancho suffered losses of cattle and horses from raids by Native Americans coming through Cajon Pass and Banning Pass from the deserts. Eventually, they sold the Rancho to Mormon settlers in September 1851. The Adobe&#x27;s later owners included John Brown Sr., James W. Waters, and the Dunlap family; it was acquired by San Bernardino County in 1955. The site is marked by California Historical Landmark #528.

The nearby Oak Glen area is best known for its apple orchards, some of which are operated by the direct descendants of the original founders (the Parrish, Wilshire, Rivers, and Law families). The Parrish Pioneer Ranch and orchard were founded by Enoch Parrish in 1876, with the other families coming into the area later.

===21st century===
At 1:53 p.m. on June 16, 2005, Yucaipa experienced a 4.9 Mw earthquake that was centered four miles (6 km) north of the center of town. It had a maximum Mercalli intensity of VI (&quot;Strong&quot;) and was felt from downtown Los Angeles to some areas of San Diego. Three people were injured.

In 2016, Yucaipa broke ground on a multipurpose performing arts center on the corner of Acacia Avenue and California Street. Sitting on in the heart of uptown, the venue hosts a variety of events, including community theater, open-air concerts, dance, and other arts-related events. The performing arts center officially opened in Spring 2019.

<text>Yucca Valley is an incorporated town in San Bernardino County, California, United States. The population was 21,738 as of the 2020 census. Yucca Valley lies north of Palm Springs, and east of San Bernardino. Bordered to the south by the Joshua Tree National Park and to the west by the San Bernardino Mountains, the town of Yucca Valley is located in the Mojave Desert at roughly above sea level.

==History==

Native Americans inhabited the area.

Norman J. Essig was key in the late 1950s in working towards establishing Yucca Valley as a place for entertainment celebrities to come and live in privacy. He personally acquired hundreds of acres of land during this time and owned and ran Glenn Realty. He helped to put in the main roads that are running throughout the town off of Hwy 62. He was personal friends with Jimmy Van Heusen the composer and gave him prime real estate in Yucca Valley to build his house which can still be seen atop the highest hill in the center of the town.

In 1992, three large earthquakes occurred near the city, the magnitude 6.1 Joshua Tree earthquake on April 22, and on June 28 the 7.3 Landers and 6.5 Big Bear earthquakes.

The 7.1 magnitude Hector Mine earthquake on October 16, 1999, had an epicenter north of town.

On July 11, 2006, a wildfire started by lightning raced through neighboring Pioneertown. The blaze, named the Sawtooth Complex fire, also burned into Yucca Valley and nearby Morongo Valley and destroyed roughly of desert landscape.

<text>Alpine is a census-designated place (CDP) in the Cuyamaca Mountains of San Diego County, California. Alpine had a population of 14,696 at the 2020 census, up from 14,236 at the 2010 census. The town is largely surrounded by Cleveland National Forest and borders two reservations of the Kumeyaay, Viejas and Sycuan tribes, and the rural unincorporated areas around the city of El Cajon.

==History==
Before its modern settlement, the area was part of the home of the Kumeyaay Indians, whose ancestors had lived here for possibly as long as 12,000 years.

The community&#x27;s name was suggested by a resident in the 1880s who said that the environment reminded her of her native country of Switzerland.

The small commercial district along Alpine Boulevard has seen some suburban development in recent decades, and it is surrounded by large stretches of less densely populated rural areas that began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Horse ranches and small farms are still common, along with open chaparral hillsides and riparian canyons.

In 2003, the Cedar Fire ravaged the Alpine area.

==Geography==
Alpine sits on both sides of Interstate 8 at the eastern extent of the California coastal region and the western extent of the Peninsular Ranges, about east of downtown San Diego, at an elevation of about .

The location of Alpine is not precisely defined since it is an unincorporated area. According to the United States Geological Survey, it is at (32.8350521, -116.7664109), which is near the intersection of Alpine Boulevard and Tavern Road. That is approximately where most maps place Alpine. Kumeyaay tribes are indigenous to the area, and the Ewiiaapaayp Band and Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians both have headquarters in Alpine.

According to the United States Census Bureau, it is at (32.834563, -116.770615), which is approximately west of the USGS location. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , 99.99% land and 0.01% water.

<text>Bonita (Spanish for &quot;Beautiful&quot;) is a census-designated place (CDP) in southern San Diego County, California, nestled between the cities of Chula Vista, National City, and San Diego. The population was 12,917 at the 2020 census, up from 12,538 at the 2010 census.

== Geography ==
Bonita is located at .

According to the United States Census Bureau, Bonita has a total area of . of it is land and of it (2.71%) is water.

While Bonita is politically designated as an unincorporated community, bounded by the incorporated cities of Chula Vista, San Diego and National City, it is closely associated with the geography of the Lower Sweetwater Valley. Thus considered, Bonita occupies about a five-mile (8 kilometer) stretch of the Sweetwater River, its valley, and surrounding hills on either side, bounded upstream (east) by Sweetwater Reservoir, and downstream (west) effectively by Interstate 805. The community crosses west of I-805—an area less than —reaching as far south and west as East H Street and Hilltop Drive. Its northern boundary is State Route 54 and its southern extent reaches approximately one-mile (1.6 km) south of the river.

Large portions of modern Bonita consist of housing tracts built throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, including:
* Bonita Verde Estates
* Bonita Downs
* Bonita Fairways
* Bonita Glen
* Bonita Highlands
* Bonita Long Canyon
* Bonita Woods
* Bonita Woods Park
* Emerald Ranch
* Lynwood Hills
* Ames Ranch
* Villas de Bonita
* Rancho Robinhood

The Bonita area is populated by coyote, racoon, fox, rabbit, squirrel, bobcat, opossum, and skunk, among other wildlife.

== History ==
Before the arrival of the Spanish, Kumeyaay lived in the area around Sweetwater Valley, and called it Apusquel. After the establishment of Mission San Diego de Alcalá, the valley was used for cattle raising but was not significantly settled. After gaining independence from the Spanish Empire, the valley became part of a land grant awarded to John (Don Juan) Forster. The word &quot;Bonita&quot; is a feminine word for &quot;pretty&quot; in the Spanish language. It was the name of a ranch owned by Henry Ernest Cooper, Sr. in 1884, and was used by the nearby post office. The ranch itself was used to cultivate lemons, which were first grown in the area beginning in 1871. During the early years lemon industry was thriving, where it became the originator of the Bonnie Brae Lemon variety, named after the first lemon ranch in the community.

In 1888, Sweetwater Dam was built, creating Sweetwater Reservoir and forever changing the geography of the region. Soon after, in 1906, the dam broke as a result of extensive rains which overfilled the reservoir, and the Lower Sweetwater Valley was completely flooded.

Bonita has experienced minor flooding throughout history, generally as a result of high seasonal rains attributed to El Niño. The floods most affect the Central Avenue river crossing, as no bridge has ever been built, unlike the Bonita Road and Willow Road crossings which are bridges, the former of which was rebuilt in the late 1990s.

In the 1990s and 2000s, the development of State Route 125 (The South Bay Expressway) became a major issue to Bonita residents, much as Interstate 805 and State Route 54 did during their development. Opponents argued that Bonita&#x27;s rural nature would be compromised without benefit while proponents argued that the highway would reduce the significant increase in surface-street car traffic the community had seen since the 1980s when the eastern Chula Vista communities surrounding Eastlake were developed. The tollway opened in November 2007 and sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy on March 22, 2010, when the cost of litigation over the construction of the road threatened to overwhelm its ability to operate and pay off its loans. On April 14, 2011, South Bay Expressway LP emerged from bankruptcy, and in a closed session on July 29, 2011, the SANDAG board of directors voted to purchase the lease to operate the State Route 125 toll road for approximately $345 million.

In 2007, Glen Abbey Memorial Park was declared a historic district, having been designed by architects who also worked on Balboa Park, and other landscapes and architectures that are significant to the history of San Diego. It is one of only three historic districts in unincorporated San Diego County.

The Bonita Historical Society, which operates the Bonita Museum &amp; Cultural Center, is the principal repository of historical information for the Lower Sweetwater Valley.

== Climate ==

The climate in Bonita is a combination of the coastal and inland valley climates of San Diego County: warmer (and sunnier during the May Gray and June Gloom periods) than areas directly adjacent to San Diego Bay or the coast, but not as hot as communities in inland valleys such as El Cajon, or even nearby Spring Valley. In summer, Bonita&#x27;s climate is pleasant.

== Government ==

In the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, Bonita is in District 1.

In the California State Senate, Bonita is in California&#x27;s 40th State Senate district. In the California State Assembly, Bonita is split between , and .

In the United States House of Representatives, Bonita is in .

== Parks and recreation ==

Bonita is considered a rural and equestrian enclave in the middle of suburbia.

To visitors and residents alike, one of the most visible features of Bonita&#x27;s recreational life is the walking trail that loops the Chula Vista Municipal Golf Course in central Bonita. Hundreds of residents walk, run, and ride this trail every day for pleasure and fitness, and the trail has become a vital component of Bonita&#x27;s life for many residents. During El Nino years, this golf course and surrounding walking trails have flooded, closing the golf course and preventing many residents from using the walking trails.

In the late 1990s, Sweetwater Regional Park was expanded and significantly improved, extending the walking and equestrian trails to an even greater number, and introducing a camping area at Summit Meadow Road. Now, virtually the entire valley from the reservoir to I-805 formally serves recreational purposes as either park or golf course. Sweetwater County Park, at the intersection of Briarwood Road and Sweetwater Road, is a wildlife preserve with a small pond that supports some fishing.

Equestrianism has long been a part of the Bonita community, and many trails exist throughout the Lower Sweetwater Valley. There are several connections to trails external to Bonita as well. Many residents still keep their own horses and can be seen riding the trails regularly. The Bonita Valley Trails organization monitors and supports the network of trails throughout the valley.

The following parks serve the Bonita community:
* Rohr Park
* Sweetwater Regional Park
* Sweetwater County Park
* Sweetwater Reservoir Riding and Hiking Trail
* Bonita Golf Course
* Chula Vista Municipal Golf Course

== Events ==
Bonitafest is an annual community event, held in early autumn, highlighted by a parade and street fair along Bonita Road which includes crafts, music, entertainment, and food. The Kiwanis Club hosts a Bonitafest Golf Tournament in conjunction with this event. At this time, there is also an annual community play called the Bonitafest Melodrama, co-founded by Max Branscomb in the 1970s.
In 2008, Bonita did not have enough funds to pay for traffic police to redirect traffic during the parade, so no parade was held during the Bonitafest.
