<text>Metropolis is a fictional city appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, best known as the home of Superman and his closest allies and some of his foes. First appearing by name in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #16 (Sept. 1939), Metropolis is depicted as a prosperous and massive city in the Northeastern United States, in close proximity to Gotham City. In recent years, it has been stated to be located in New York.

The co-creator and original artist of Superman, Joe Shuster, modeled the Metropolis skyline after Toronto, where he was born and lived until he was ten. Since then, however, the look and feel of Metropolis has been greatly influenced by New York City.

Within the DC Universe, Metropolis is depicted as being one of the largest and wealthiest cities in the world, having a population of 11 million citizens.

In addition to Superman, the city has also been home to other superheroes, such as Booster Gold and Black Lightning.

==Creation==
Like many other fictional cities in DC Comics, the location of Metropolis has varied over the years but is usually portrayed as a major city in the Northeast, sharing various qualities with New York City. Superman co-creator Joe Shuster moved to Cleveland at age ten, where he met co-creator and Ohio native Jerry Siegel.

Originally intending to sell the Superman strips to a Cleveland newspaper, they decided to set the stories there, but when the strips were re-used for the comic books, they changed the location to the fictional Metropolis. Shuster was quoted as having modeled his Metropolis cityscape on that of his hometown, Toronto, and in the early versions of Superman, Clark Kent worked for a newspaper called the &quot;Daily Star&quot;, modeled after the real-life &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. &quot;Action Comics&quot; #2, however, mistakenly portrays Clark Kent as a reporter for the &quot;Cleveland Evening News&quot;.

==Geography==

In &quot;Superman&quot; #2 (Fall 1939), Metropolis was actually placed in the U.S. state of New York, making it the earliest specific reference to the location of Metropolis. In that issue, Clark Kent (Superman) sends a telegram to George Taylor, the editor of the &quot;Daily Star&quot; (the antecedent to the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;), addressed to &quot;Metropolis, N.Y.&quot;

In the 1940s &quot;Superman&quot; cartoons, produced by Paramount Pictures, Fleischer Studios and Famous Studios, Superman is said to live on the island of Manhattan. In the seventh cartoon of the series, &quot;Electric Earthquake&quot; (1942), a Native American mad scientist claims that his people are the rightful owners of Manhattan, thus placing these cartoons on the island. In the fifth cartoon in the series, &quot;The Bulleteers&quot; (1942), the name of the city is identified as Metropolis, as the Bulleteers address in that cartoon the population of Superman&#x27;s city as &quot;citizens of Metropolis&quot;; and in the thirteenth cartoon &quot;Destruction, Inc.&quot; (1942), Metropolis is even seen spelled out twice on the Metropolis Munition Works.

In a 1970s edition of &quot;Ask the Answer Man&quot;, a column that ran occasionally in DC publications, it was stated that Metropolis and Gotham City were adjacent to New York City; across the harbor from each other. That same column stated that Green Arrow&#x27;s home, Star City, was in Connecticut, Flash&#x27;s Central City was in Ohio, and Hawkman&#x27;s Midway City was in Michigan. An earlier issue of DC&#x27;s fanzine &quot;Amazing World of DC Comics&quot;, however, stated that Metropolis was located in Delaware, while Gotham was placed in New Jersey. The 1990 &quot;Atlas of the DC Universe&quot; role playing game supplement, published by Mayfair Games, states that Metropolis is in Delaware.

In June 1976, &quot;Superman&quot; #300 featured an out-of-canon story about the infant Kal-El arriving on Earth in that year, triggering an increase in Cold War tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union. In that story&#x27;s version of the year 2001, passing reference is made to the merging of the eastern seaboard cities from Boston to Washington, D.C., into a &quot;newly incorporated urban center&quot; called &quot;Metropolis&quot;.

In his 1978 work, &quot;The Great Superman Book&quot;, an encyclopedia of the first forty years of the Superman comics, author Michael Fleisher cites many examples which demonstrate that Metropolis equates with New York City. The most blatant of these might be the statement he cites from &quot;Action Comics&quot; #143 (April 1950), which states that the Statue of Liberty stands in &quot;Metropolis Harbor&quot;. The Statue of Liberty, in fact, stands in New York Harbor.

In the pre-&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; comics, Smallville was often shown as being within driving distance of Metropolis, although with no definitive location. John Byrne&#x27;s 1986 revamp of Superman cited the city as being in Kansas.

The 1992 &quot;Death of Superman&quot; storyline depicts Doomsday on a path from Ohio through the state of New York, ending in Metropolis, and the 2005 comic &quot;Countdown to Infinite Crisis&quot; also places Metropolis in the state of New York.

The 2003 DC Comics/Marvel Comics crossover mini-series &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot; depicts the city as along the multi-state Interstate 95, which is the main highway on the East Coast of the United States, and portrays the corresponding location in the Marvel Universe as forests and fields, explaining that Marvel&#x27;s Earth and DC&#x27;s Earth have different surface areas to account for their different geography (no Metropolis on Marvel&#x27;s Earth, no Latveria on DC&#x27;s Earth, and so on).

On the television series &quot;&quot;, the second part of the episode titled &quot;Little Girl Lost&quot; depicts Darkseid&#x27;s minion using a machine hidden in or around Metropolis to attempt to pull a comet into the earth. The beam from that machine is depicted originating from the area of the mid-western United States where Kansas is located. In the second part of the episode &quot;Last Son of Krypton&quot; when Lois is introduced to Clark Kent, she is told he is from Smallville, she replies &quot;Smallville? Never heard of it&quot;, prompting Clark Kent to ask her if she had ever been to Kansas. Lois replies &quot;God No!&quot; while turning her head in a sign of visible disgust.

Frank Miller has said that &quot;Metropolis is New York in the daytime; Gotham City is New York at night.&quot; Gotham City is home to Batman, whose activities are more often nocturnal, while Metropolis is home to Superman, who usually operates during the day. In terms of atmosphere, &quot;Batman&quot; writer and editor Dennis O&#x27;Neil has said that, figuratively, &quot;Batman&#x27;s Gotham City is Manhattan below 14th Street at eleven minutes past midnight on the coldest night in November, and Metropolis is Manhattan between 14th and 110th Streets on the brightest, sunniest July day of the year&quot;. New York City has been more recently used as a locale in the DC Universe, like the Marvel Universe, in which it exists as a separate city from Metropolis and Gotham City. The Justice Society of America, for example, is based in New York, as were the Teen Titans.

===In relation to Gotham City===

Metropolis is frequently depicted as being within driving distance of Gotham City, home of Batman. This happens, for example, in the three-issue 1990 mini-series of &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; by Dave Gibbons, Steve Rude, and Karl Kesel. The distance between the two cities has varied greatly over the years, ranging from being hundreds of miles apart to Gotham and Metropolis being twin cities on opposite sides of Delaware Bay, with Metropolis in Delaware and Gotham City being in New Jersey.

In Bronze Age stories that depicted Metropolis and Gotham City as twin cities, the Metro-Narrows Bridge was said to be the main route connecting Metropolis to Gotham City. Stated as being the longest suspension bridge in the world, the Metro-Narrows Bridge is likely based on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which stretches between Staten Island and Brooklyn in New York City.

In &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Superheroes&quot; newspaper comic strip, a 1978 Sunday strip shows a map of the east coast of the United States; the map places Metropolis in Delaware and Gotham City across Delaware Bay in New Jersey, with the Metro-Narrows Bridge linking the two cities. A similar map appeared in &quot;The New Adventures of Superboy&quot; #22 (October 1981), with Smallville shown within driving distance of both cities (in post-Crisis comics, Smallville was officially relocated to Kansas). 1990&#x27;s &quot;The Atlas of the DC Universe&quot; also places Metropolis in Delaware and Gotham City in New Jersey.

However, the exact location of the two cities has varied. A map of the United States in the Secret Files &amp; Origins Guide to the DC Universe 2000 depicts Metropolis and Gotham City (alongside Bl√ºdhaven) as being somewhere in the tri-state area.

In the TV series &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, when Lois finds out about Superman&#x27;s secret identity and yells at Clark about how he&#x27;s been hiding his secretly being Superman, he responds, &quot;A little louder, Lois. I don&#x27;t think they could hear you in Gotham City.&quot; In the TV series &quot;Smallville&quot;, Linda Lake, a columnist for the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;, once boasted that she could see Gotham City from her new office. In &quot;&quot;, Bruce Wayne is shown taking his private jet aircraft to Metropolis, indicating that the two cities have at least some distance between them.

In the 2016 film &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;, director Zack Snyder confirmed that Metropolis and Gotham City would be portrayed as geographically situated right next to each other, on the opposite sides of a bay, similar to Jersey City and Manhattan.

==History==
A Native American tribe sold Metropolis Island to the first European settlers in 1644, similar to the history of New York City, in which Native Americans sold Manhattan Island to Dutch settlers in 1626.

==Features==
Over the years, Metropolis&#x27; features have greatly changed in the comics; however, Metropolis is always presented as being a global city. It is often referred to as &quot;The Big Apricot&quot; just as New York City is nicknamed &quot;The Big Apple&quot;. It is commonly portrayed as having an Art Deco style of architecture, much like New York City. The skyline and many of the notable landmarks in Metropolis are based on real-life landmarks in New York City. Frank Miller has said that &quot;Metropolis is New York in the daytime; Gotham City is New York at night.&quot;

Metropolis&#x27; features became more defined and more obviously based on New York following both 1985&#x27;s &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; miniseries and John Byrne&#x27;s subsequent revamping of Superman, including the late 1980s comic special &quot;The World of Metropolis&quot;.

According to &quot;Action Comics&quot; #143 (April 1950), the Statue of Liberty is said to stand in &quot;Metropolis Harbor&quot;, while the real-life Statue of Liberty stands in New York Harbor. However, most stories indicate the Statue of Liberty is actually in New York City, which also exists in the DC Universe as a separate city from Metropolis.

The map of Metropolis designed for Mayfair Games&#x27; first edition of the &quot;DC Heroes Role-Playing Game&quot; resembled that of Manhattan.

===Districts and boroughs===
Metropolis is made up of six boroughs, the largest being New Troy. Each of the boroughs has its own distinct character and feel, which resemble and mimic New York City&#x27;s boroughs.

====New Troy====

New Troy is the largest borough in Metropolis. Resembling Manhattan, New Troy is a skyscraper island bustling with commerce and business. The concrete and steel canyons of the city rise to dizzying heights. &quot;1930s architecture stretched like a rubber band&quot; as cited in the &quot;Art of Superman Returns&quot; book.

The &quot;Daily Planet&quot; Building is the most recognizable landmark in the Metropolis skyline, much like the Empire State Building for New York City. Located in &quot;Planet Square&quot;, it is particularly known for the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; globe atop the building. Other prominent skyscrapers include the Emperor Building (a reference to the Empire State Building), the Newstime Building (home of the national &quot;Newstime&quot; magazine, a reference to and combination of &quot;Newsweek&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;) which is secretly owned for several years by Lord Satanus posing as &quot;Colin Thornton&quot;, and the Twin Towered LexCorp Tower, (a reference to the former twin towers of the World Trade Center), headquarters for Lex Luthor&#x27;s company.
Besides the Financial District, notable areas of New Troy include:
* Chinatown ‚Äì Metropolis&#x27; Asian District.
* Little Bohemia ‚Äì The arts capital of Metropolis and a reference to Little Italy and Greenwich Village in Manhattan.
* Glenmorgan Square ‚Äì An area that is based on Times Square.

Famous streets in New Troy include Fifth Avenue, Bessolo Boulevard, and Topaz Lane. The latter two are Metropolis&#x27; versions of Broadway in New York City. Bessolo Boulevard&#x27;s name is derived from &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; lead actor George Reeves&#x27; legal name before entering films. Other Metropolis boulevards in the New Troy borough are similarly named for other actors from that series and from its radio predecessor of the same name, such as Coates, Larson, and Collyer.

Centennial Park (sometimes labeled as Metropolis Park) is Metropolis&#x27; largest city park and is based on real life Central Park of New York City. Its most noteworthy feature is a statue of Superman with an American bald eagle erected after his apparent death fighting Doomsday. A statue of Superboy (Conner Kent) was built next to it after the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;.

In 1990s and 2000s stories, the married Clark Kent and Lois Lane live in an apartment in New Troy, at 1938 Sullivan Lane, which is a tribute to the year Superman first appeared. The apartment was a wedding gift to the couple by Bruce Wayne, who owned the building. Clark Kent&#x27;s traditional address of 344 Clinton Street, Apartment 3D, was usually described as being located in midtown Metropolis.

=====Suicide Slum=====
In northwestern New Troy is the impoverished and crime-infested neighborhood of Suicide Slum, best known for the 1940s adventures of the Guardian and his street urchin companions the Newsboy Legion and in more contemporary times with Gangbuster. Although the northwestern location is similar to the relationship of Harlem to midtown Manhattan, the neighborhood bears more physical and cultural resemblance to Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side. The Ace o&#x27; Clubs is a bar owned by Bibbo Bibbowski in Suicide Slum.

=====Other locations in New Troy=====
Other notable places and their NYC inspirations in New Troy include:

* Wireless City Movie Theater ‚Äì A spoof of Radio City Music Hall.
* Metropolis International Airport ‚Äì A spoof of LaGuardia Airport
* Halldorf Hotel ‚Äì A spoof of Waldorf Astoria.
* Lacey&#x27;s Department Store ‚Äì A spoof of Macy&#x27;s.
* Stacey&#x27;s Department Store ‚Äì Another homage of Macy&#x27;s
* Spiffany&#x27;s Jewelry Store ‚Äì A spoof of Tiffany&#x27;s.

====Boroughs and suburbs====
New Troy is separated from the suburban boroughs by the West River and Hobb&#x27;s River, based on New York&#x27;s East River and Hudson River, respectively.

=====Midvale=====
Midvale is a suburb of Metropolis, more well known as the home of Supergirl and the site of the Midvale Orphanage prior to the events of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. It is located 60 miles northwest of Metropolis.

=====Bakerline=====
Bakerline is another borough of Metropolis. Located north of New Troy, Bakerline is the home of newspaper reporter Jimmy Olsen and appears to be based on The Bronx in New York City.

=====Other boroughs and suburbs=====
Other boroughs and suburban areas, almost all of which are based on real places in New York City, include Queensland Park (a reference to Queens), Hell&#x27;s Gate (a reference to Hell Gate Bridge), St. Martin&#x27;s Island (a reference to Staten Island), Park Ridge (a reference to Park Slope), Metrodale, and Highville.

==Cultural, educational, and research institutions==

In the Silver Age and Bronze Age comics, a major Metropolis landmark is the Superman Museum. The Superman Museum features various exhibits dedicated to Metropolis&#x27; favorite superhero, similar to the Flash Museum in Central City. The Museum&#x27;s exhibits were responsible for the origin of the Composite Superman. Members of the criminal organization the 100 at one point secretly used the Superman Museum as their base of operations, which was discovered by the superhero Black Lightning and his nemesis the Whale. Superman, under the effects of hypnosis, once went on a rampage and wrecked several pieces at the museum. The Superman Museum, like the Flash Museum, is also usually shown as existing well into the Legion of Super-Heroes&#x27; era, as shown in various stories and the 2000s television series &quot;Legion of Super Heroes&quot;.

The central branch of S.T.A.R. Labs, a major scientific research institution, is also located in Metropolis.

The Metropolis Museum of Natural History was featured in the film &quot;Superman Returns&quot;.

===Education===
Metropolis University, Clark Kent&#x27;s alma mater, is located in the city of Metropolis; Clark graduated with a degree in journalism. The college has a floating aquarium anchored just offshore called the &quot;Ark&quot;.

==Law and government==

===Mayors===
At least four mayors are considered part of Metropolis&#x27; history:

* Mayor Frank Berkowitz - Mayor Frank Berkowitz began his term prior to Superman&#x27;s first known public meeting with Lex Luthor as depicted in the &quot;Man of Steel&quot; #4 mini-series by John Byrne. Superman was given a choice: join Luthor and receive a generous check from him as first payment for his services, or arrest Luthor for the events in #4 as Berkowitz asked him to. Superman&#x27;s decision made Lex Luthor his deadliest enemy to this day. Some years later, Frank Berkowitz was killed by a sniper hired by Lex Luthor.
** Mayor Frank Berkowitz appeared in the &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; episode &quot;The Man of Steel Bars&quot; portrayed by Sonny Bono. In different points of this episode, Mayor Berkowitz made references to the titles of the songs that his actor performed with Cher. He talked about the Metropolis heat wave in November when scientists suspected that Superman was responsible when it was secretly a factory owned by Lex Luthor that was emitting large amounts of heat. Once Superman fixed up the factory upon Lois begging on TV for Superman to return, Mayor Berkowitz noticed the temperature change as Lex Luthor uses a loophole to keep himself from getting incriminated.
* Mayor &quot;Buck&quot; Sackett - &quot;Buck&quot; Sackett was elected as Berkowitz&#x27;s successor. He was covertly Lex Luthor&#x27;s &quot;puppet&quot;.
* Mayor Fleming - Mayor Fleming is an African-American female who has been introduced in Nick Spencer&#x27;s &quot;Jimmy Olsen&quot; back-ups. She chose Jimmy Olsen and Sebastien Mallory to show the Dalwythians around the city.
* Mayor Rob Morrisroe - Mayor Rob Morrisroe is the mayor of Metropolis in the first issue of &quot;Superman&quot; (vol. 3), as of DC&#x27;s 2011 New 52 reboot.

===Metropolis Police Department===
The Metropolis Police Department headed by Commissioner David Corporon possesses a Special Crimes Unit dedicated to defending the city against superhuman menaces in case Superman is absent. The unit is headed by Maggie Sawyer and Dan Turpin, both of whom maintain frequent contact with the Man of Steel. Another of Superman&#x27;s police contacts over the years has been Inspector William Henderson, who is currently the Metropolis police commissioner. The police unit is featured in a 1994‚Äì1995 limited series, &quot;Metropolis SCU&quot;. At some point during the missing year following Infinite Crisis, the division of the Metropolis Police Department dedicated to superhuman crime was renamed the Science Police, seemingly a reference to the similarly named group in the Legion of Super-Heroes&#x27; 31st Century.

Stryker&#x27;s Island Penitentiary (based on New York&#x27;s Riker&#x27;s Island) is the name of Metropolis&#x27; largest prison facility, as well as the name of the island on which it sits; it is located in Metropolis&#x27; West River south of New Troy (the real-life Riker&#x27;s Island sits in the East River, connected by a foot and vehicle bridge to the nearby borough of Queens, although the island itself and its jail complex are technically and officially part of The Bronx).

===Metropolis Fire Department===
Post-Crisis, Fireman Farrell is shown to be a member of the Metropolis fire department. As of &quot;Batman &amp; Superman: World&#x27;s Finest&quot; #4 (July 1999), Farrell is now a captain in the Metropolis FD.

==Media==
Metropolis&#x27; premier newspaper is the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;, one of the most renowned news organizations in the DC Universe. The city is also home to the national &quot;Newstime&quot; magazine, where Clark Kent held the position of editor during the Eradicator story arc until he was fired by his superior, Collin Thornton, in &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; #465, for his increasingly strange behavior due to the Eradicator (including firing of some employees).

Other major media located in Metropolis include WGBS-TV, flagship station of the Galaxy Broadcasting System (GBS) television network, both subsidiaries of media conglomerate Galaxy Communications. Popular shows included &quot;The Midnight Show Starring Johnny Nevada&quot; (a fictional version of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, with Johnny Nevada being an analogue of Johnny Carson).

Between the early 1970s and mid-1980s, both Clark Kent and Lois Lane worked for WGBS after Galaxy Communications purchased the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; in a 1971 storyline, with Clark as the anchorman for the WGBS evening news. He was eventually joined by Lana Lang as a co-anchor. After John Byrne&#x27;s revamp of Superman&#x27;s origins, though, Clark and Lois were reverted to working at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; once again. Galaxy Broadcasting and WGBS-TV still exist post-Crisis, however, and are usually used in any story where a television station or network is needed or shown. Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;, Clark, Lois and Lana never worked for the station. During the 1990s however, both Jimmy Olsen and Cat Grant did work there.

==People and culture==
The people of Metropolis are depicted as a diverse group of large city-dwellers within the comics. They live in one of the world&#x27;s largest, wealthiest, and most important cities.

===Sports===
As befitting any world city, Metropolis is represented by teams in all major-league sports. Like New York City, it is home to two teams in baseball and football. Of the two baseball teams, the Metropolis Monarchs are Clark Kent&#x27;s favorite, while the other team, the Metropolis Meteors, is mentioned in &quot;52&quot; as having a rivalry with the St. Louis Cardinals.

In American football, Metropolis is home to the Metropolis Metros and the Metropolis Meteors. The latter football team (sharing the same name as the above baseball team) once featured Steve Lombard as its star quarterback. On the TV show &quot;Smallville&quot;, there is a football team called the Metropolis Sharks.

The city is also home to the Metropolis Generals basketball team, who play in Shuster Sports Arena, presumably named for Superman co-creator Joe Shuster.

Professional ice hockey is also present in Metropolis; its NHL team is the Metropolis Mammoths.

Several sports stadiums have been mentioned over the years. One such stadium is Metropolis Stadium, which was built in 1940. (Pre-Crisis, Metropolis Stadium had an Earth-Two counterpart, which was named &quot;Sportsman&#x27;s Stadium&quot;.) This was perhaps influenced by the real-life Sportsman&#x27;s Park in St. Louis, for many years the shared home of baseball&#x27;s St. Louis Cardinals and St. Louis Browns.

==Legion-Era Metropolis==
Metropolis is traditionally depicted as continuing to survive, thrive and expand well into the 30th- and 31st-century timeframes used as the backdrop of the &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; in all that series&#x27; varied incarnations to date.

During the original incarnation of the series, Metropolis would be depicted as covering anything ranging from the entire Atlantic American coast to a more narrowed jurisdiction ‚Äì according to one map officially published during Paul Levitz and Keith Giffen&#x27;s initial partnership on the series, in &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; (vol. 2) #313 (July 1984) ‚Äì covering most of Massachusetts, all of Rhode Island and Connecticut, New York State from Long Island&#x27;s eastern tip up into the Catskills, and a large portion of northern New Jersey. In one imaginary &quot;Superman&quot; tale published in 1976 and partly set in then-futuristic 2001, &quot;Metropolis&quot; is the name of the new megalopolis of the Eastern seaboard corridor, comprising the cities of Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, New York and Boston and all the territory in between (&quot;Superman&quot; #300, June 1976).

Whatever version was used, it was generally viewed as given that the original city, as well as Gotham City, were considered within Legion-era Metropolis&#x27; boundaries, from the mid-1960s until the events of &quot;Zero Hour&quot;.

The first post-&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; version of the series as published in the &quot;three-boot&quot; edition has described Metropolis as having expanded over the intervening millennium up the &quot;entire Atlantic seaboard&quot; of North America in one issue (reminiscent of New York&#x27;s future expansion in Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot; and in Poul Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Corridors of Time&quot;, and to an extent &quot;Mega-City One&quot; of the &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; comics). In &quot;Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds&quot;, it is revealed that this version of Metropolis belongs to the newly restored Earth-Prime&#x27;s 31st Century.

In &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; (vol. 2) #12, Metropolis during the Legion&#x27;s first year is described by Brainiac 5 as having a population of &quot;78 million sentient inhabitants in the urban zone before you reach the greenbelt&quot;.

===Film===
*In 1978&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot; and its sequels, Metropolis is shown as taking the place of New York City. The original movie series made no attempt to hide this similarity, as prominent New York landmarks are seen throughout the movies, including the Statue of Liberty, the World Trade Center, the Chrysler Building, Rockefeller Center, the United Nations Headquarters, the Empire State Building, the Brooklyn Bridge, Grand Central Terminal, and the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; offices. (However, in &quot;Superman IV: The Quest for Peace&quot;, in the scene involving a runaway train in the Metropolis &quot;Metro City Transit&quot; subway system, an advertising poster on the subway station wall soliciting public donations for the then-ongoing Statue of Liberty restoration effort urges the donations be sent to &quot;The Lady, P.O. Box 1986, New York 10018&quot; - implying that Metropolis and New York are, in fact, two separate places.) In &quot;Superman III&quot;, some Calgary, Alberta landmarks can be seen, including the Calgary Tower and the St. Louis Hotel, as parts of the film were filmed there.

*&quot;Superman Returns&quot; director Bryan Singer intended his version of Metropolis to be a stylistic cross between 1930s New York and current New York. The many shots of Superman flying high above the city establish that although Metropolis has a rectangular park reminiscent of Central Park, the city overall has a slightly different shape from New York City. Several New York City landmarks, such as the American International Building, Battery Park, the MetLife Building, the Woolworth Building, World Financial Center, 7 World Trade Center, and the Brooklyn Bridge, were clearly shown, as was the street grid of lower Manhattan, with a fictional bridge inserted north of Battery Park City and a fictional pier in the middle of Battery Park. The map of Metropolis shown in this article, however, tries to make the city&#x27;s form as different as possible from New York City&#x27;s, given the scenery shown. Photographs of some automobiles used in filming show license plates bearing the phrase &quot;New York State&quot; along the bottom, although the featured vehicles (including Lois Lane&#x27;s car) are shown in the film to have license plates reading &quot;The First State&quot; Lex Luthor&#x27;s map onscreen portrays the city as directly in the location of New York City. Senior production designer Guy Dyas said in &quot;The Art of Superman Returns&quot; (Chronicle Books, 2006): &quot;We wiped out, I think, half of New Jersey to put in Metropolis.&quot; The map showed Metropolis clearly being in place for New York City but in New York State. Long Island was not shown. Midtown Manhattan was only shown twice, both in brief high aerial shots of the city at night. The first had the Empire State Building and Chrysler Building obstructed by clouds while the GE Building was visible. The second, all three buildings would appear but very briefly. License Plates show the Daily Planet Building as the main symbol for Metropolis. With no World Trade Center due to the September 11, 2001 attacks (which took place during Superman&#x27;s five-year departure from Earth), the real life Empire State Building, or in this case the Emperor Building as named in the comics, would be the tallest in Metropolis. In past &quot;Superman&quot; movies, Metropolis was suggested to be New York City itself. Landmarks like the World Trade Center and Statue of Liberty were seen on film. In &quot;Superman Returns&quot;, Metropolis is New York City with minor changes. The movie focused primarily on Lower Manhattan with Midtown Manhattan only shown twice in the distance. 17 State Street, which is a recognizable glass tower at the tip of the island was replaced by an older looking tower and the tops of the two World Financial Center Towers were removed. A small cluster of tall Art-Deco Towers along with the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; building were added to the skyline near the Civic Center. The LexCorp Tower never appeared in the movie; comics suggest LexCorp had a Twin Towered Headquarters, which suggests that if they still existed, the World Trade Center North and South towers were the LexCorp Towers, but being 2006, unlike the older &quot;Superman&quot; movies, the World Trade Center&#x27;s Twin Towers, did not appear, being that the setting is after the September 11, 2001 attacks. It is implied that 9/11 happened shortly after Superman&#x27;s five-year departure from Earth, as in 2006, five years ago it was 2001 where the world was in no major wars until the events of 9/11. Despite this, one aerial shot showed several small buildings over the site, probably suggesting that they never existed, yet a quick scene showed footage of the War on Terror on television news. Parts of &quot;Superman Returns&quot; was filmed in Sydney, Australia, and some minor landmarks in Sydney can be identified such as &quot;Martin Place&quot;, when Superman catches the car. License plates on cars that state the first state may also refer to NSW license plates.

*Metropolis appears extensively the DC Extended Universe, first appearing in &quot;Man of Steel&quot; and later &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; and &quot;Justice League&quot;. Areas of Vancouver, downtown Chicago and Detroit have been used as filming locations for the city, with several fictional buildings being added. Much of Metropolis is destroyed during the fight between Superman and General Zod in the first film&#x27;s climax. It also appears to be a federal district similar to Washington, DC, with a ZIP code of 33866. Director Zack Snyder confirmed that Metropolis and Gotham City are portrayed as being in close geographical proximity to each other but are separated by Delaware Bay. In &quot;Justice League&quot; it is revealed there is a tunnel connecting the two, constructed as part of the abandoned &#x27;Metropolis Project&#x27; in 1929 to connect the two cities. There are multiple islands located in the bay also, with one of them being named Braxton Island. During Super Bowl 50, an advertisement for Turkish Airlines showcased a rebuilt Metropolis, with Lex Luthor (played by one of the film&#x27;s stars, Jesse Eisenberg) declaring the city open for business again. A &quot;Gotham City&quot; version of the ad, starring Ben Affleck&#x27;s Bruce Wayne and sharing an identical theme, also aired during the game.

*Metropolis also appears in most of the DC Comics animated films in which Superman makes an appearance, namely &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Superman/Batman: Public Enemies&quot;, &quot;Superman/Batman: Apocalypse&quot;, &quot;All-Star Superman&quot;, &quot;Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths&quot;, &quot;Justice League: Doom&quot;, &quot;Superman vs The Elite&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;DC League of Super-Pets&quot;. It additionally appears in the live action/animated hybrid film &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;.

===Video games===
Metropolis appears in several video games, including &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Superman Returns&quot;, &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot;, where it is shown partially in ruins following the Justice League&#x27;s fight with Darkseid, and it appears in &quot;DC Universe Online&quot;.

Metropolis appears in the game &quot;&quot;, in two different forms- a Prime Earth version, in which the Joker attempts and fails to destroy the city with an atomic bomb, and an alternate universe Earth version, which occurs as a result of the Joker succeeding in his plot, which also involved the death of Lois Lane and Superman&#x27;s unborn son. The alternate universe, or &quot;Regime&quot; Metropolis is used as a playable fighting stage. Here, it has been rebuilt into a more dystopian city, which is where the &quot;prime&quot; Batman and Joker end up when they are accidentally transported there. The Prime Earth version, however, is not a playable stage in the game, and is only shown as a cameo in the game&#x27;s story mode. One notable feature in each version of Metropolis is a statue depicting Superman with a globe. In the Prime universe, the statue depicts Superman standing below the globe, carrying it above his head, symbolizing that he follows the world&#x27;s rules. On the other hand, in the Regime universe, the statue depicts Superman standing above the globe with his arms folded, symbolizing that the world follows his rules, as he has become a tyrant following the destruction of the original Metropolis and the deaths of Lois Lane and their unborn son. Metropolis is the only stage in the game to have three sections: the city streets, the top of the Daily Planet, and a museum featuring past superhero costumes and weapons.

Metropolis appears in &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;, where it is taken over by Sauron from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; franchise, With Superman being sucked into an alternate dimension, Batman, Gandalf, and Wyldstyle oppose Sauron.

Metropolis appears as a playable stage in &quot;Injustice 2&quot;. The two sections consist of Memorial Station (which contains statues of Superman and his downfall and Lex Luthor&#x27;s opposition) and the Ace O&#x27; Clubs bar. In the story mode, Metropolis is one of the cities Superman fails to restore on Brainiac&#x27;s ship.

In &quot;Lego DC Super-Villains&quot;, part of the open world is Metropolis. LexCorp Tower, The Daily Planet, and S.T.A.R. Labs are featured.

An open-world Metropolis is the main setting of &quot;Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&quot;, with Brainiac taking over the Justice League through mind control and having them capture and destroy the city, so he can rebuild it new.

===Theme parks===
Metropolis appears in the &quot;Justice League: Alien Invasion 3D&quot; dark ride designed and created by Sally Corporation for Warner Bros. Movie World in Gold Coast, Australia. The city also appears in the &quot;Justice League: Battle for Metropolis&quot; dark ride created by Sally Corporation and is located at several Six Flags theme parks. A section of Warner Bros. World Abu Dhabi is themed after Metropolis, with major landmarks serving as entrances to attractions such as the Daily Planet for a Superman attraction, the Hall of Justice for a Justice League ride, and the Metropolis Observatory for a Green Lantern attraction. Patrons can also eat at a restaurant themed after Big Belly Burger.

==Metropolis, Illinois==
The real town of Metropolis, Illinois, has been proclaimed the &quot;hometown of Superman&quot; by the Illinois State Legislature, and the town celebrates its &quot;local hero&quot;. Among the ways it celebrates the character include a large Superman statue in the city, a Superman museum, an annual Superman festival, and its local newspaper &quot;The Metropolis Planet&quot;, a name inspired by the major newspaper in fictional Metropolis, the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. A version of the town has appeared in the comics itself, as a city whose citizens idolize the hero who lives in their &#x27;sister&#x27; city.

<text>English is a town in and the county seat of Crawford County, Indiana, United States. The population was 645 at the 2010 census, making it one of Indiana&#x27;s smallest county seats. The settlement was named Hartford (1839-1884) prior to its incorporation.

==History==
English was called Hartford when it was laid out in 1839. When the town incorporated in 1884 it was renamed English for William Hayden English, an Indiana politician of the day. On December 28, 1893, the county seat of Crawford County was relocated from Leavenworth to English.

The first community was located at the confluence of two small rivers (Bird Dog Creek and Brownville Creek) with Blue River. It was a thriving community during the first half of the 20th century, with population rising to above 800 by 1950, but economic activity slowed thereafter (partly due to recurring flooding), and commercial establishments closed. Most residents now live on the higher ground surrounding the original settlement. A large swath of the previous inhabited level area has been converted into the Lucas Oil Golf Course.

From 1959 to 1990, English suffered six floods. The town council decided that the only solution to the flooding problem was to move the town. of high ground were purchased, a partnership was formed with Lincoln Hills Development Corporation, and a major portion of the town was relocated.

According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, English previously had a humid continental climate, but as of the 2016 update it now has a humid subtropical climate due to climate change. As Southern Indiana is in a transitional zone between these two areas, localized climate does not firmly adhere to either classification.

==Music==
Music in the area has widely been known to be Country or Bluegrass with music festivals in that area supporting that genre of music. In 2024, an alternative band by the name &#x27;Faith In Humanity&#x27; recorded their 2nd album &#x27;The Dark Wave&#x27; making them the first band to have recorded a full studio album in that area despite living in a poverty stricken part of town due to multiple floods damaging that area over the years. With Country music being predominantly popular within the area, Punk and Synthwave are currently also playing a major factor in music in the area.

<text>Leavenworth is a town in Jennings Township, Crawford County, Indiana, along the Ohio River. The 2010 US Census recorded a population of 238 persons.

== History ==

=== Foundation and early settlement ===

Leavenworth was laid out in 1818 in a horseshoe shaped bend of the Ohio River, directly under a large bluff called Mt. Eden. The bluff forms part of the Indiana Ridge and faces directly across the river toward Kentucky. &quot;Old Leavenworth&quot; (the original town, now practically abandoned) was almost completely wiped out by the huge 1937 Ohio River flood, as it was built directly on the floodplain.

The town was founded by Zebulon Leavenworth and his brother Seth, natives of Connecticut.

In 1824, a wood yard was established in the town to provide fuel to steamboats, and David Lyon had a boatbuilding industry here in 1830. The Whitcomb brickyard was also a flourishing industry.

&quot;The Crisis&quot;, Crawford County‚Äôs first newspaper, was begun in Leavenworth in 1839.

In 1835, Zebulon started a stage line from Leavenworth to the new state capitol in Indianapolis, a route intended primarily for students going to the new State College in Bloomington (later Indiana University) and for boatmen returning from downriver.

Riverboat men returning from New Orleans were thought to be carriers of the yellow fever and cholera epidemics that often devastated the Ohio Valley frontier. Seth Leavenworth advocated the construction of a marine hospital for the purpose of quarantine and medical treatment, which he hoped to build somewhere near the town of Leavenworth. The bill he put before the Indiana legislature was never enacted.

In 1843, Leavenworth supplanted Fredonia as the county seat. Leavenworth remained the county seat until 1896, when the county records were stolen by a mob in a notorious armed ‚Äúcourthouse war&quot; against the town of English.

Seth Leavenworth eventually left Indiana and moved to Missouri, where he died in 1854. His son Zebulon, named after the boy&#x27;s uncle in Indiana, became a famous riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River and was a friend of Mark Twain before Twain became a writer. Together, they piloted the steamboat &quot;Nebraska&quot; past Memphis at the outbreak of the Civil War, receiving gunshots across their bow as a warning to halt.

=== The Hines Raid, 1863 ===

In June 1863, a 25-year-old Confederate spy from Kentucky, Thomas Hines, was sent by General John Hunt Morgan to ride north into Indiana and reconnoiter with Southern sympathizers there, whose dedication to the Southern cause Morgan drastically overestimated. Hines and his party of nearly a hundred men stole uniforms from a Union supply depot in Brownsville, Kentucky, then robbed a train in Elizabethtown to acquire Union currency. Dressed as Federal troops, they crossed the Ohio River on horseback a few miles downstream from Leavenworth, then struck out for Paoli, pretending to be in pursuit of Union deserters.

In French Lick, they met with the local Copperhead leader, Doctor William A. Bowles, who headed the Confederate-leaning Democratic party in southern Indiana and was a supporter of slavery. Bowles told them he was unable to help them. Indiana Home Guards were then in pursuit of the Confederates. Hines hired a Leavenworth local to guide them to a safe ford over the river where they could escape into Kentucky, but the local was actually a Union supporter and betrayed them. Residents of Leavenworth carried ammunition to Union troops, who gunned several of the horsemen down as they tried to get across the river at Little Blue Island. Three Confederate soldiers were killed and a large number were taken prisoner and kept in the Methodist Church in Leavenworth. The spy, Hines, escaped.

At the end of the Civil War, Leavenworth was a thriving town, a regular stop for steamboats on the Ohio River.

=== The Fire of 1890 ===
In the Fall of 1890 a fire ravaged a portion of the town and many business were destroyed. The hotel, the newspaper, and most of the stores in the town suffered a complete loss. The fire was discovered by Lyman Davis, a porter at the Hawn Hotel, but all attempts to extinguish the blaze were to no avail.

=== Button Making and Lime Quarries ===

Button-making was an important industry, relying on shell banks in the river. The industry declined in the 1920s, when shell banks were exhausted. A total of 700 people lived in the town in 1910 and three button factories employed twenty-four families. Other industries included boat-making, freight hauling, and barrel production.

Quarries opened up in the 1880s and lime was shipped out on flatboats. In October 1890, a fire destroyed about one-third of Leavenworth. The population at this time was over five hundred.

===The 1937 Ohio River Flood===

The river&#x27;s waters began to rise in January 1937. Record rainfalls by late January resulted in a huge flood, the most destructive in the Ohio Valley&#x27;s history. Of 145 houses in Leavenworth, twenty floated away and sixty-five were lifted off their foundations. Four hundred of the town‚Äôs population of 418 were forced to evacuate.

Laborers enlisted by Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s Works Progress Administration (WPA) and the Salvation Army salvaged what they could, but when the waters receded, it was decided to move what was left of Leavenworth uphill. Under the direction of Indiana Work Relief Administrator John K. Jennings, the town decided to relocate to the top of the bluff, rendering &quot;Old&quot; Leavenworth a ghost town. Rebuilding was complete by December 1938. Leavenworth was then the only completely rebuilt community in Indiana, though in the 1950s and 1990s, English was ravaged by floods on the Blue River and eventually relocated to higher ground in the mid 1990s, the second largest relocation of a town in U.S. history.

<text>Montgomery is a town in Barr Township, Daviess County, Indiana, United States. The population was 792 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Montgomery was laid out in 1865 by Valentine B. Montgomery. Montgomery was a station and shipping point on the Ohio and Mississippi Railway.

St Peter&#x27;s church is one of the oldest Catholic parishes in Indiana. The first church was a log-cabin built in 1818, followed by frame church in 1823. In 1841, bishop C√©lestine Guynemer de la Hailandi√®re gave the parish and the land to French priest and missionary Edward Sorin, CSC who came with seven Brothers of the Congregation of Holy Cross. At the time the property consisted in 160-acre tract of land, the frame church with two additional small rooms, and two log cabins. One cabin was used as a school conducted by Charles Rother who took the name Brother Joseph. In the early months of 1842, Sorin started to conceive the idea of founding a college, although one was already present in Vincennes (the College of St. Gabriel, which failed soon after). Sorin thought of founding the college there in St Peters, but he met the opposition of the bishop who lamented that this was not in the original plans and it conflicted with the existence of St. Gabriel&#x27;s college. However, the bishops also stated that he was not against a founding of a college elsewhere, provided that this effort would not prevent him his Brothers from accomplishing their education duties. Near the end of October the bishop offered Sorin certain lands at the furthermost limits of the diocese in South Bend. Sorin left St. Peters and proceeded to found the University of Notre Dame.

Greensburg was laid out in 1822 by Col Thomas Hendricks, a veteran of the War of 1812. 

Michigan Road was completed in 1837, bringing more people to settle and visit the growing town. After the Cincinnati, Indianapolis, and St. Louis Railroad was completed in 1853, the town boomed. Agriculture, foundries, millineries, wholesale grocers, and other businesses took advantage of Greenburg&#x27;s strategic rail position.

===20th century===
At the beginning of the twentieth century, race relations in Greensburg worsened, leading to the expulsion of African Americans from the city after race riots against them in 1906 and 1907. According to James W. Loewen, Greensburg then was for decades a sundown town, a town that was purposely all-white.

&quot;The Indianapolis News&quot; reported that the incident on April 30, 1907, in which white residents drove non-whites from Greensburg, began as local outrage increased following a reported assault on a well-known Decatur County woman by John Green, a Black man. The &quot;News&quot; asserted that the incident was not a race war and was instead &quot;the work of whiskey and every good citizen of Greensburg deplores it.&quot; The &quot;News&quot; put further blame on a &quot;wide-open policy&quot; that allowed &quot;disreputable whites and depraved negroes&quot; that had been in force for two years.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Greensburg has a total area of , of which (or 99.52%) is land and (or 0.48%) is water.

Mass production of the Honda Civic (eighth generation) sedan commenced at IAP on October 9, 2008. A second shift was added in fall 2011. Production capacity was increased by 25% to accommodate the start of production of the Civic hybrid in early 2013. In 2018, Honda invested US$32.5 million to expand its plant with a new 19,200 square-foot building for new in-house subassembly of vehicles&#x27; front end module, including radiator and cooling fan.

==Culture==
===Historical society===
The Historical Society of Decatur County established a museum in 1976 in a historic former residence. The museum underwent an expansion and renovation in 2006, providing better facilities for storage, record keeping, and exhibits. Visits to the Historical Society Museum and a Pioneer Day event provide students an interactive learning experience on the life of the area&#x27;s first settlers. Another school enrichment project allows students to research historic buildings, focusing on the age, architecture, use and other information that would help place the structure within the community&#x27;s story. The results are then condensed onto bronze plaques placed on the exterior of the buildings. The incentive package included $5,000 to offset moving expenses, a year&#x27;s membership to the local co-working space and YMCA, gift cards to the seasonal farmers market, tickets throughout the year to productions at the local playhouse, home-cooked meals and a program called &quot;Grandparents on Demand&quot;, which offered babysitting hours and a stand in on Grandparents Day at school.

===Landmarks===
The Bromwell Wire Works, Decatur County Courthouse, Greensburg Carnegie Public Library, Greensburg Downtown Historic District, Bright B. Harris House, Jerman School, and Knights of Pythias Building and Theatre are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Tree on the Courthouse Tower===
The Decatur County Courthouse in Greensburg is known for a tree which grows from the top of the Courthouse Tower, giving Greensburg its nickname, &quot;Tree City&quot;.

There have been one or more trees growing continually since the first tree was noticed in the early 1870s. Later, other small trees appeared on the clock tower.

County officials were initially concerned that the trees would cause damage to the roof, and a steeplejack was hired in the 1880s to remove some of them. Two trees were left, with one ultimately growing to a height of nearly . By the time it died, another tree had appeared.

Today, there are two trees on the tower. During a recent tree trimming a piece of the tree was examined by several Purdue University foresters and they positively identified the tree as a mulberry tree.

<text>Auburn is a city in DeKalb County, Indiana, United States. The population was 13,412 at the 2020 census. Founded in 1836 by Wesley Park (1811‚Äì1868), the city is the county seat of DeKalb County. Auburn is also known as &quot;Home of the Classics&quot;.

==History==
Auburn&#x27;s site on Cedar Creek was chosen by Wesley Park and John Badlam Howe at the intersection of two major trails, Goshen-Defiance Road and Coldwater Road, and next to the land of John Houlton. The name for the community likely came from &quot;The Deserted Village&quot; by Oliver Goldsmith, that begins &quot;Sweet Auburn! Loveliest village of the plain.&quot; The plat of the Village of Auburn is dated April 21, 1836, but it was held by Howe and not recorded until March 12, 1879. John Drury purchased the first lot (Lot 73) for $25.00 on September 5, 1837. The first store was built at Park&#x27;s corners by Thomas Freeman, applying for a license on March 5, 1838, and bringing supplies by horseback from Fort Wayne. Daniel Altenburg, Levi Walsworth, the Sherlock family, Samuel Sprott, David Weave, David Shoemaker, Henry Curtis, Lyman Childsey, James Cosper, and David Cosper were among the early residents.

A post office was established in 1839. In 1841, malaria ran through the town, and in 1843 a terrible storm wreaked havoc on cabins and crops. The Church of God was built by the Presbyterians in 1846. The Village of Auburn was incorporated in 1849, divided into wards, and governed under a town board and constable. By the end of the American Civil War, the town included over 700 inhabitants. The storm of September 29, 1872, destroyed Odd Fellow&#x27;s Hall and damaged the Methodist Episcopal church. A few months later, on April 6, 1873, the new brick block of Seventh Street (Snyder&#x27;s Building) collapsed, also destroying the Ensley Building. Auburn Water and Lights was constructed in 1898. The change in status to the City of Auburn on March 26, 1900, followed a referendum. Notable citizen Charles Eckhart erected a public library and a YMCA building.

The Auburn Automobile Company, which was founded in 1900, produced its first automobile in 1903. William Wrigley, Jr. and Errett Lobban Cord controlled interests in the company, which eventually acquired Duesenberg, Lexington, and Lycoming Engines, and started Cord Car Company. The company failed in August 1937. Other makes of cars built in Auburn include Black, De Soto (Not De Soto by Chrysler), IMP, Kiblinger, McIntyre and Zimmerman.

The Auburn Rubber Company was started in 1913 as the Double Fabric Tire Company, making tires for Auburn Automobile Company. In the 1920s, as Auburn Rubber, it became a large manufacturer of rubber toys, leaving Auburn in 1959. Auburn was home to early automobile company DeSoto in 1913. This company has no connection with the DeSoto that was manufactured by Chrysler.

Bank robber John Dillinger and some accomplices raided Auburn&#x27;s police station on October 14, 1933, stealing a submachine gun, two steel vests, three rifles, six pistols and over 1000 rounds of ammunition.

The acts that led to the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Stump v. Sparkman&quot;, 435 U.S. 349 (1978), the leading American case on judicial immunity, took place in Auburn in 1971. On June 28, 1988, four workers were asphyxiated at a local metal-plating plant in the worst confined-space industrial accident in U.S. history; a fifth victim died two days later.

The Auburn Community Mausoleum, Auburn Cord Duesenberg Automobile Museum, Downtown Auburn Historic District, and Eckhart Public Library and Park are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="112215" wikidata="Q2161311" url="?curid=112215" title="Hamilton, Indiana">
<text>Hamilton is a town located on the border of Steuben County, Indiana and DeKalb County, Indiana. In Steuben County, it is in Otsego Township, and in DeKalb County it is in Franklin Township. The population was 1,532 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
In the late 1830s, the land that present-day Hamilton was built on was sold by the owner Niconar Munson to Dr. Samuel Tuttle, who was the first to plat the town. The original name of the town was &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Dr. Tuttle went to New York shortly thereafter, where he met Fisher Howe, president of a syndicate of capitalists. Dr. Tuttle sold all but one-sixteenth of the plat to him for $15,000. In the spring of 1838, Howe sent Sidney Gambia, an agent, to Enterprise to sell goods and develop the settlement. However, Enterprise was heavily ladened with illness that year, to such an extent that it became known for it. To improve the settlement&#x27;s reputation, the name was changed to Hamilton. Eventually the town was sold to Sidney Gambia for $1 (and for other terms), and the name was officially recorded as the Town of Hamilton in 1844.

A post office was established under the name Enterprise in 1837, and was renamed to Hamilton in 1844. The post office remains in operation.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Hamilton has a total area of , of which (or 75.87%) is land and (or 24.13%) is water.

The town is served by Indiana Highway 1, Indiana Highway 427, and Bellefontaine Road, which connects to Old US 27 in Pleasant Lake. The town is mainly a resort town that sees an influx of vacationers known colloquially as &quot;lakers&quot; during the summer months. The town is served by the Hamilton Police Department and the Hamilton Volunteer Fire Department. The main feature of the town is its namesake lake which the town was built around. Author Edward Eager vacationed here as a child in the 1920s, and featured the lake and local places like the hotel at Cold Harbor in one of his children‚Äôs books, ‚ÄúMagic by the Lake‚Äù.

A few years ago, the Flegal Brothers Gravel Pit, located on the Northwest end of the lake, was shut down and sold. After getting the go-ahead from state and federal officials, the closed pits were allowed to flood and then the portion of land separating the old gravel pit from the lake was removed and the newly created additions to the lake were named Crystal Bay and Crystal Cove and were sold off to a developer for the construction of new homes.

Neighborhoods in the town include Russels Point, Oakwood, Penn Park, Forest Park, and Island Park.

Wes-Del Middle/High School has produced WDN, a weekly video featuring students reporting the current events occurring in the school, and released it on YouTube. Wes-Del Middle/High School also became the first school to let students work on personal projects to be released to the school if desired and give out awards red carpet style in 2016.

The motorcade transporting Vice President Mike Pence and Karen Pence passed through Gaston on May 18, 2019. The motorcade passed in front of Wes-Del High School where contestants and volunteers in the school&#x27;s first color run had gathered and the vice president was saluted by volunteer fireman and Gaston police as he made his way to deliver a speech at Taylor University&#x27;s graduation. He also delivered a speech at the nearby Delta High School.

Gaston is hoping to grow by opening new businesses and attractions. The town is hoping to reach a population goal of 2,500 by 2025.

<text>Muncie ( ) is an incorporated city and the seat of Delaware County, Indiana, United States. It is located in East Central Indiana about northeast of Indianapolis. At the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population was 65,195, down from 70,085 in the 2010 census. It is the principal city of the Muncie metropolitan statistical area, which encompasses all of Delaware County. The city is also included in the Indianapolis‚ÄìCarmel‚ÄìMuncie combined statistical area.

The Lenape people, led by Buckongahelas, arrived in the area in the 1790s. They founded several villages, including one known as Munsee Town, along the White River. The trading post, renamed Muncietown, was selected as the Delaware County seat and platted in 1827. Its name was officially shortened to Muncie in 1845 and incorporated as a city in 1865. Muncie developed as a manufacturing and industrial center, especially after the Indiana gas boom of the 1880s. It is home to Ball State University. As a result of the Middletown studies, sociological research that was first conducted in the 1920s, Muncie is said to be one of the most studied United States cities of its size.

== History ==
===Early settlement===
The area was first settled in the 1790s by the Lenape (Delaware) people, who were forced west from their tribal lands in the Mid-Atlantic region (all of New Jersey, southeastern New York, eastern Pennsylvania, and northern Delaware) to new lands in present-day Ohio and eastern Indiana. The Lenape founded several towns along the White River, including Munsee Town, near the site of present-day Muncie.

Contrary to popular legend, the city&#x27;s early name of Munsee Town is derived from the &quot;Munsee&quot; clan of Lenape people, the white settlers&#x27; name for a group of Native Americans whose village was once situated along the White River. There is no evidence that a mythological Chief Munsee ever existed. (&quot;Munsee&quot; means a member of or one of their languages.)

In 1818, the area&#x27;s native tribes ceded their lands to the federal government under the terms of the Treaty of St. Mary&#x27;s and agreed to move farther west by 1821. New settlers began to arrive in what became Delaware County, Indiana, , shortly before the area&#x27;s public lands were formally opened for purchase. The small trading village of Munsee Town, renamed Muncietown, was selected as the Delaware County seat and platted in 1827. On January 13, 1845, Indiana&#x27;s governor signed legislation passed by the Indiana General Assembly to shorten the town&#x27;s name to Muncie. Soon, a network of roads connected Muncie to nearby towns, adjacent counties, and to other parts of Indiana. The Indianapolis and Bellefontaine Railroad, the first to arrive in Muncie in 1852, provided the town and the surrounding area with access to larger markets for its agricultural production, as well as a faster means of transporting people and goods into and out of the area.

Muncie incorporated as a town on December 6, 1854, and became an incorporated city in 1865. John Brady was elected as the city&#x27;s first mayor. Muncie&#x27;s early utility companies also date to the mid-1860s, including the city&#x27;s waterworks, which was established in 1865.

After the American Civil War, two factors helped Muncie attract new commercial and industrial development: the arrival of additional railroads from the late 1890s to the early 1900s and the discovery of abundant supplies of natural gas in the area. Prior to the discovery of nearby natural-gas wells and the beginning of the gas boom in Muncie in 1886, the region was primarily an agricultural area, with Muncie serving as the commercial trading center for local farmers.

===Industrial and civic development===
The Indiana gas boom of the 1880s ushered in a new era of prosperity to Muncie. Abundant supplies of natural gas attracted new businesses, industries, and additional residents to the city. Although agriculture continued to be an economic factor in the region, industry dominated the city&#x27;s development for the next 100 years. One of the major manufacturers that arrived early in the city&#x27;s gas-boom period was the Ball Brothers Glass Manufacturing Company, which was renamed the Ball Corporation in 1969. The Ball brothers, who were searching for a new site for their glass manufacturing business that was closer to an abundant natural-gas supply, built a new glass-making foundry in Muncie, beginning its glass production on March 1, 1888. In 1889 the company relocated its metal manufacturing operations to Muncie.

In addition to several other glass factories, Muncie attracted iron and steel mills. Kitselman Steel &amp; Wire Company was the largest employer in Indiana in 1900 with 11,000 employees; it later became Indiana Steel &amp; Wire. Others included Republic Iron and Steel Company and the Midland Steel Company. (Midland became Inland Steel Company and later moved to Gary, Indiana.) Indiana Bridge Company was also a major employer. By the time the natural gas supply from the Trenton Gas Field had significantly declined and the gas boom ended in Indiana , Muncie was well established as an industrial town and a commercial center for east-central Indiana, especially with several railroad lines connecting it to larger cities and the arrival of automobile industry manufacturing after 1900.
Numerous civic developments also occurred as a result of the city&#x27;s growth during the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s, when Muncie citizens built a new city hall, a new public library, and a new high school. The city&#x27;s gasworks also began operations in the late 1870s. The &quot;Muncie Star&quot; was founded in 1899 and the &quot;Muncie Evening Press&quot; was founded in 1905. A new public library, which was a Carnegie library project, was dedicated on January 1, 1904, and served as the main branch of the city&#x27;s public library system.

The forerunner to Ball State University also arrived at the turn of the twentieth century. Eastern Indiana Normal School opened in 1899, but it closed after two years. Several subsequent efforts to establish a private college in Muncie during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries also failed, but one proved to be very successful. After the Ball brothers bought the school property and its vacant buildings and donated them to the State of Indiana, the Indiana State Normal School, Eastern Division, the forerunner to Ball State University, opened in 1918. It was named Ball Teachers College in 1922, Ball State Teachers College in 1929, and Ball State University in 1965.

Beginning in the late nineteenth century, in tandem with the gas boom, Muncie developed an active cultural arts community, which included music and art clubs, women&#x27;s clubs, self-improvements clubs, and other social clubs. Hoosier artist J. Ottis Adams, who came to Muncie in 1876, later formed an art school in the city with fellow artist William Forsyth. Although their school closed with a year or two, other art groups were established, most notably the Art Students&#x27; League (1892) and the Muncie Art Association (1905).

By the early twentieth century several railroads served Muncie, which helped to establish the city as a transportation hub. The Cincinnati, Richmond and Muncie Railroad (later known as the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway) reached Muncie in 1903. The Chicago, Indiana, and Eastern Railroad (acquired by a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad system) and the Chicago and Southeastern (sometimes called the Central Indiana Railroad) also served the city. In addition to the railroads, Muncie&#x27;s roads connected to nearby towns and an electric interurban system, which arrived in the early 1900s, linked it to smaller towns and larger cities, including Indianapolis and Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Dayton, Ohio.

With the arrival of the auto manufacturing and the related auto parts industry after the turn of the twentieth century, Muncie&#x27;s industrial and commercial development increased as the population grew. During World War I, local manufacturers joined others around the county in converting their factories to production of war materiel. In the 1920s Muncie continued its rise as an automobile-manufacturing center, primarily due to its heavy industry and skilled labor force. During this time, the community also became a center of Ku Klux Klan activity. Muncie&#x27;s Klan membership was estimated at 3,500 in the early 1920s. Scandals within the Klan&#x27;s leadership, divisions among its members, and some violent confrontations with their opponents damaged the organization&#x27;s reputation. Increasing hostility toward the Klan&#x27;s political activities, beliefs, and values also divided the Muncie community, before its popularity and membership significantly declined by the end of the decade.

Muncie residents also made it through the challenges of the Great Depression, with the Ball brothers continuing their role as major benefactors to the community by donating funds for construction of new facilities at Ball State and Ball Memorial Hospital. (The hospital, which opened in 1929, later affiliated with Indiana University Health.) The Works Progress Administration (WPA) also provided jobs such as road grading, city sewer improvements, and bridge construction.

===Middletown studies===

In the 1920s, Robert and Helen Lynd led a team of sociologists in a study of a typical middle-American community. The Lynds chose Muncie as the locale for their field research, although they never specifically identified it as &quot;Middletown&quot; the fictional name of the town in their study. Muncie received national attention after the publication of their book, &quot;Middletown: A Study in Contemporary American Culture&quot; (1929). The Lynds returned to Muncie to re-observe the community during the Depression, which resulted in a sequel, &quot;Middletown in Transition: A Study in Cultural Conflicts&quot; (1937). The Lynds&#x27; Middletown study, which was funded by the Rockefeler Institute of Social and Religious Research, was intended to study &quot;the interwoven trends that are the life of a small American city.&quot;

The Lynds were only the first to conduct a series of studies in Muncie. The National Science Foundation funded a third major study that resulted in two books by Theodore Caplow, &quot;Middletown Families&quot; (1982) and &quot;All Faithful People&quot; (1983). Caplow returned to Muncie in 1998 to begin another study, Middletown IV, which became part of a Public Broadcasting Service documentary titled &quot;The First Measured Century&quot;, released in December 2000. The Ball State Center for Middletown Studies continues to survey and analyze social change in Muncie. A database of Middletown surveys conducted between 1978 and 1997 is available online from the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA). Due to the extensive information collected from the Middletown studies during the twentieth century, Muncie is said to be one of the most studied cities of its size in the United States.

In addition to being called a &quot;typical American city&quot;, as the result of the Middletown studies, Muncie is known as Magic City or Magic Muncie, as well as the Friendly City.

===World War II to the present===

During World War II, the city&#x27;s manufacturers once again turned their efforts to wartime production. Ball State and Muncie&#x27;s airport also trained pilots for the U.S. Navy. The postwar era was another period of expansion for Muncie, with continued growth and development of industries, construction of new homes, schools, and businesses. A population boom brought further development, especially from 1946 to 1965.

Since the 1950s and 1960s, Muncie has continued as an education center in the state and emerged as a regional health center. As enrollment at Ball State increased, new buildings were erected on the college&#x27;s campus. Ball Memorial Hospital also expanded its facilities. However, by the 1960s, industrial trends had shifted. Beginning in the 1970s several manufacturing plants closed or moved elsewhere, while others adapted to industrial changes and remained in Muncie. Ball Corporation, for example, closed its Muncie glass manufacturing facilities in 1962 and its corporate headquarters relocated to Broomfield, Colorado in 1998. Muncie was also home to other manufacturing operations, including Warner Gear (a division of BorgWarner), Delco Remy, General Motors, Ontario Corporation, A. E. Boyce Company, and Westinghouse Electric, among others.

In 2017, the Muncie Community Schools system was declared a &quot;distressed political subdivision&quot;, and put in direct control of the state government. In 2018, the school district was reformed and a new board was appointed by Ball State&#x27;s Board of Trustees.

In 2021, following the Fall of Kabul and the U.S. withdrawal from the War in Afghanistan, several Afghan refugees arrived in Camp Atterbury, near Edinburgh, Indiana. Munsonian members of the nationwide organization, Afghan Women&#x27;s and Kids&#x27; Education and Necessities (AWAKEN) formed the Muncie Afghan Refugee Resettlement Committee (MARRC) to help Afghan refugees resettle in Muncie. Afghan refugees began arriving in Muncie soon after. As the AWAKEN organization wanted to continue work directly in Afghanistan, the temporary MARRC organization was closed. However, the presence of 130 Afghan refugees in Muncie in late 2022 compelled continued work in medical advocacy, employment, legal aid, and financial and reading education. A new organization, Refugee Alliance of Delaware County (RADC), was formed to welcome any refugees in Muncie and help them in establishing and building a new life.

===African-American history===
The black population in Muncie grew from 3.7% in 1890 to 5.6% in 1920 to 13.2% in 2013. Muncie&#x27;s Riverside and Normal City neighborhoods had imposed sundown town rules by 1904, meaning &quot;that unknown negroes who are found on the streets after nightfall are liable to be severely dealt with.&quot; In 1920, the city had the fifth-largest black population in Indiana, with 2,054 black residents. Two major parades were held by the Ku Klux Klan in 1922 and 1924, with the mayor and police chief attending the 1924 parade.

The first black police officer in Muncie was hired in 1899, and the city&#x27;s first black police chief took his position in 1995. The first black teacher in the city was hired in 1952, and the first black principal was appointed in 1956.

According to Hurley Goodall, the first serious black political candidate in Muncie was Wayne Brooks, who ran for the Republican nomination for mayor in 1934. Ray Armstrong was elected as the first black member of the city council in 1951, and Alice McIntosh was elected as the first black female member of the city council in 1983. Goodall was the first black person elected to the city&#x27;s school board and later to represent the area in the state house. No other black person served on Muncie&#x27;s school board after Goodall&#x27;s election to the state house until Carl Kizer Jr.&#x27;s appointment to the board in 1993. The school board became majority black for the first time after the 2008 election.

== Economy ==
From its early days as a regional trading center for the surrounding agricultural community to its first wave of industrial development brought on by the Indiana gas boom in the mid-1880s, Muncie has retained its ties to an industrial economy, and to a lesser extent its agricultural roots. In addition, the arrival of the forerunner to Ball State in the early twentieth century contributed to Muncie&#x27;s development as an educational center, while Ball Memorial Hospital, established in 1929, led to the city&#x27;s reputation as a healthcare center for east-central Indiana.

Muncie&#x27;s major industrial development included glass manufacturing, iron and steel mills, and automobile manufacturing and auto parts factories. Among its early major employers was the Ball Corporation, established by the Ball brothers of Buffalo, New York, who opened a glass factory in Muncie in 1888. Other notable manufacturers in addition to the Ball Corporation with operations in Muncie have included BorgWarner, The Broderick Company (aformer division of Harsco), Dayton-Walther Corporation, Delco Remy, General Motors, New Venture Gear, Hemingray Glass Company, Ontario Corporation, A. E. Boyce Company, Indiana Steel and Wire, and Westinghouse Electric.

Changing industrial trends caused shifts in the city&#x27;s economic development. As in many mid-sized cities in the Rust Belt, deindustrialization, which began in the 1960s, impacted Muncie&#x27;s economy. Several manufacturing plants closed or moved elsewhere. From 2001 to 2011, Muncie lost thousands of jobs as the city continued transitioning from a blue-collar workforce to a white-collar service economy primarily based on health care, education, and retail.

Muncie has attracted some new manufacturers, while older factories have been converted to other industrial uses. In 2009, Muncie became the U.S. headquarters for Brevini Wind, an Italian-based company that manufactures gearboxes for wind turbines. In 2011, locomotive maker Progress Rail (a subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc) opened in a former Westinghouse facility that had been vacant since 1998.

The local economy is a controversial topic among Munsonians. While many older unemployed or underemployed residents strongly identify with the manufacturing identity of the city, newer residents identify with the city&#x27;s shift towards educational and health services. Contention is greatest among residents living in the once-industrialized sections of the city&#x27;s south side, as much of the economic growth over that last few decades has taken place on Muncie&#x27;s north side. The city also struggles to retain college graduates. Despite Ball State&#x27;s presence, only 32.2 percent of Delaware County&#x27;s working-age adults (ages 25‚Äì64) hold a two-year or four-year college degree, which is below the national average.

The first decade of the 21st century saw a cultural shift toward local businesses and economic empowerment, boosted by the Muncie Downtown Development Partnership and the residents, patrons, and business owners of the downtown community. In 2007, Muncie was rated the most affordable college town in America by real estate company Coldwell Banker. In 2015, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Muncie 27th among small places for business and careers and 18th for cost of doing business. First Merchants Corporation is based in Muncie, and the first Scotty&#x27;s Brewhouse location opened in the city in 1996.
 (compare to October 2014), the largest employers in the city were:
==Arts and culture==

The Horizon Convention Center, located downtown, offers of exhibition space and houses the Muncie Children&#x27;s Museum. The city also has a large group of independent art galleries.

Three of the city&#x27;s largest performing arts centers belong to Ball State University: the 3,581-seat Emens Auditorium, the 600-seat Sursa Performance Hall, and the 410-seat University Theatre. Downtown performing arts spaces include the Muncie Civic Theatre and Canan Commons, an outdoor amphitheater and greenspace that opened in 2011. In addition, the Muncie Ballet and the Muncie Symphony Orchestra are prominent in the city&#x27;s arts community.

Minnetrista Museum &amp; Gardens, just north of downtown along the White River, is a cultural heritage museum featuring exhibits and programs focusing on nature, local history, and art. The campus includes historic homes that were once owned by the Ball family, themed gardens, outdoor sculptures, and a portion of the White River Greenway. The Cardinal Greenway, Indiana&#x27;s longest rail trail project, stretches from Richmond to Marion, Indiana. Designated a National Recreation Trail in 2003, it is part of the American Discovery Trail. The Ball State campus is home to Christy Woods, an arboretum, three greenhouses, and the Wheeler Orchid Collection and Species Bank.

&quot;Passing of the Buffalo&quot; and &quot;Appeal to the Great Spirit&quot; are public sculptures in Muncie by Cyrus Edwin Dallin.

<doc id="112226" wikidata="Q2043354" url="?curid=112226" title="Yorktown, Indiana">
<text>Yorktown is a town in Mount Pleasant Township, Delaware County, Indiana, United States. The population was 11,548 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Muncie, Indiana Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
During the Woodland period Native Americans built an earthen enclosure just to the east of Yorktown, still visible on Google Earth at . Yorktown lies at the junction of the White River and Buck Creek. According to local legend, the Miami Indians believed that the peculiar configuration of the junction made Yorktown immune from tornadoes.

Yorktown was platted in 1837 by Oliver H. Smith who represented Indiana in the U.S. Senate from 1837 to 1843 and was a member of the Committee on Public Lands. Smith eventually became involved in the railroad business, and Yorktown was joined to Indianapolis by railroad in the early 1850s. Yorktown&#x27;s main street bears Smith&#x27;s name.

Yorktown benefited from the 1880s natural gas boom in the area, and was the site of several glass factories in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. (The gas gave names to nearby the towns of Gaston and Gas City and drew the Ball Brothers to Muncie.)

In 1892, a developer platted &quot;West Muncie&quot; on land immediately adjacent to Yorktown (but roughly ten miles from Muncie). Buck Creek was dammed to form &quot;Lake Delaware&quot; which became the focus of a 73-room resort hotel opened in 1893. However, the dam ruptured within a few years and the entire West Muncie project was abandoned. Its most enduring legacy was perhaps that Yorktown was erroneously labeled &quot;West Muncie&quot; on some road maps into the 1960s and perhaps later, puzzling most local residents, who had neither seen nor heard the name in any other context.

The town has been served by the Big Four Railroad and its successors: the New York Central, Penn Central, Conrail and CSX. The town was also served by an electric interurban line, the Union Traction Company of Indiana and its successor Indiana Railroad, in the early twentieth century.

In the mid twentieth century, many residents found employment in automotive plants in nearby Muncie and Anderson, most associated with General Motors. General Motors in Muncie, closed down in 2003. Borg Warner in Yorktown closed in 2009. Yorktown also served as corporate headquarters of the Marsh Supermarkets chain from 1952 until 1991, a fact reflected in the chain&#x27;s &quot;Yorktown&quot; store brand. Marsh Supermarkets and Village Pantry headquarters relocated in Indianapolis until Marsh went bankrupt and shut down in 2017.

Former Yorktown Clerk-Treasurer Beth Neff was the defendant in high-profile court proceedings (&quot;State of Indiana v. Beth A. Neff&quot;, 18S-IF-478) that saw the Indiana Supreme Court clarify state statutes relating to the conditions under which Indiana judiciaries may remove publicly elected municipal officials from office.

<text>Elkhart ( ) is a city in Elkhart County, Indiana, United States. The population was 53,923 at the 2020 census. The city is located east of South Bend, Indiana. It is the most populous city in the Elkhart‚ÄìGoshen metropolitan area, which in turn is part of the South Bend‚ÄìElkhart‚ÄìMishawaka combined statistical area, in a region commonly known as Michiana.

==History==

When the Northwest Territory was organized in 1787, the area now known as Elkhart was mainly inhabited by the Ottawa, Chippewa, and Potawatomi Indian tribes. In 1829, the Village of Pulaski was established, consisting of a post office, mill, and a few houses on the north side of the St. Joseph River. Dr. Havilah Beardsley moved westward from Ohio, and on August 9, 1821, purchased one square mile of land from Pierre Moran (a half-French, half-Native American Potawatomi Chief) in order to establish a rival town named Elkhart. The town of Elkhart was first plotted with 48 lots on April 30, 1832. In 1839, the Pulaski Post Office was officially changed to Elkhart.

Elkhart County was founded exclusively by immigrants from New England. These were old-stock &quot;Yankee&quot; immigrants, that is to say, they were descended from the English Puritans who settled New England in the 1600s. The completion of the Erie Canal caused a surge in New England immigration to what was then the Northwest Territory. The end of the Black Hawk War led to an additional surge of immigration, once again coming almost exclusively from the six New England states as a result of overpopulation combined with land shortages in that region. Some of these later settlers were from upstate New York and had parents who had moved to that region from New England shortly after the Revolutionary War. New Englanders and New England transplants from upstate New York were the vast majority of Elkhart County&#x27;s inhabitants during the first several decades of its history. These settlers were primarily members of various Protestant religions.

Correspondingly, many inhabitants of Elkhart County fought in the Union Army during the Civil War. In the late 1880s and early 1890s Irish and German migrants began moving into Elkhart County, most of these later immigrants did not move directly from Ireland and Germany, but rather from other areas in the Midwest where they had already been living, particularly the state of Ohio.

By the late 19th and early 20th century, musical instrument factories, Miles Medical Company, and numerous mills set up shop and became the base of the economy. In 1934, the first recreational vehicle factory opened in Elkhart. Similar companies followed suit for the remainder of the decade, and the economy continued to grow until the rationing of materials in World War II. After the war, growth picked back up, and, by 1949, Elkhart was dubbed the &quot;RV Capital of the World.&quot;

===Infrastructure===
In 1851, the Michigan Southern &amp; Northern Indiana Railroad Company built the first rail line through the city, and by 1852 the first passenger train passed through town. This, in turn, caused major population growth. Today, Norfolk Southern has the biggest railroad presence in town, although Elkhart has two other railroads: Shortline-Elkhart and Western (operated by Pioneer Railcorp) and Regional-Grand Elk (operated by Watco). Amtrak has two trains that stop in Elkhart, &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; and &quot;Capitol Limited&quot;, both of which stop at the Elkhart station. Canadian Pacific runs 6-8 trains through town on Norfolk Southern&#x27;s trackage.

In 1867, Elkhart Hydraulic Company built the first hydraulic dam across the St. Joseph River which would power the city&#x27;s machinery. Unfortunately, the hydraulics were prone to flooding as was common in those days, the wooden structures were eventually destroyed by fire. The hydraulics were purchased by the Indiana &amp; Michigan Electric Company and they soon reconstructed the dam and by 1913, it powered the city. Today, the dam still produces electric power and is operated by Indiana Michigan Power, a subsidiary of American Electric Power.

In 1889, the world&#x27;s second electric streetcar system began operating on the city&#x27;s streets. It has since been decommissioned.

The Beardsley Avenue Historic District, Albert R. Beardsley House, Dr. Havilah Beardsley House, Emmanuel C. Bickel House, Bridge Street Bridge, Charles Gerard Conn Mansion, Elkhart Downtown Commercial Historic District, Green Block, William and Helen Koerting House, Lerner Theatre, Mark L. and Harriet E. Monteith House, Morehous Residential Historic District, State Street-Division Street Historic District, and Young Women&#x27;s Christian Association are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Name===

The name Elkhart is a deliberate misspelling or corruption of &quot;Elks-heart&quot;, which refers to the now extinct Eastern elk. The name has been attached to the Elkhart River and surrounding area since at least 1749, when it was recorded in French as (&quot;elk&#x27;s heart&quot;) as the name of a Miami village there. The place name in Miami-Illinois is (&quot;elk&#x27;s heart&quot;). Later in the 18th century the area was inhabited by the Potawatomi; in the Potawatomi language, the place is likewise known as , &quot;at the elk heart&quot;.

The name may reflect a prehistoric association of the Elkhart area with the Kaskaskia people, whom the Miami called &quot;elk hearts&quot;. The Kaskaskia are not associated with the area in any historical records, however, having been pushed further south and west by the wars of the 17th century.

Other explanations have been suggested. According to an account by two Miami leaders (Jean Baptiste Richardville and Le Gros) recorded in 1824, the name arose from two women fighting over an elk&#x27;s heart that had been hung up to dry. Alternatively, some historians including Jacob Piatt Dunn have associated the name with the shape of an island in the Elkhart River that is stated to resemble an elk&#x27;s heart.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Elkhart has a total area of , of which (or 96.04%) is land and (or 3.96%) is water.

The city sits on the St. Joseph and Elkhart Rivers. The Elkhart River drains into the St. Joseph at Island Park just north of downtown. There are also numerous small lakes around the city.

===Climate===
Elkhart has a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen &quot;Dfa&quot;), with cold, snowy winters and warm, humid summers.

A second shopping mall, Pierre Moran Mall, was partially demolished in 2006 for a new development called Woodland Crossing.

===Industry===
Elkhart is best known for two industries: recreational vehicles and musical instruments (for example, Stephanh√∂user Saxophones). For decades, it has been referenced as the &quot;RV Capital of the World&quot; and the &quot;Band Instrument Capital of the World&quot;. Other notable industries in Elkhart include; pharmaceuticals, electronic components, manufactured housing and mobile homes. Numerous manufacturers of musical instruments and accessories, of which most of the surviving companies have been absorbed into the Conn-Selmer conglomerate, have a long history in the city. Elkhart is also home to the Robert Young Rail Yards, which are the second-largest freight classification yards in the world.

In 1884, Franklin Miles launched the Miles Medical Co. in Elkhart, which in later decades produced products such as Alka-Seltzer and Flintstones Vitamins. The Miles Medical Co. was purchased by the German company Bayer in 1978, and was consolidated into the larger Pittsburgh-based Bayer, Inc. in 1994. In 1999, Bayer Consumer Care moved out of Elkhart. By 2006, Bayer had pulled all manufacturing out of Elkhart. Most of the facilities were torn down while just a few buildings remained, mostly unused.

Manufacturers in Elkhart include Forest River Inc, Hy-Line, Keystone, and Thor Motor Coach.

NIBCO INC. (Northern Indiana Brass Company), has called Elkhart home for over 100 years and is now a fifth-generation family business. NIBCO Inc. manufactures and markets flow control products.

Elkhart Brass Manufacturing manufactures fire-fighting equipment.

The unemployment rate reached 18.8% in April 2009 and due to Elkhart&#x27;s economic troubles, the city and some of its unemployed residents were featured on the February 8, 2009, edition of ABC News. The unemployment rate rebounded over the next decade and has remained below the national average since 2013.
==Arts and culture==
===Theater===
In 1884, the Bucklen Opera House opened its doors for the first time, with a seating capacity of 1200. It was common for one performance to take place every week. Elkhart&#x27;s location on the railroad made it a good stopping point for shows traveling from New York to Chicago. In 1896, the first movie was shown in the theater, which was also used as Elkhart High School&#x27;s auditorium until 1924. The Bucklen was demolished in 1986.

The Lerner Theatre, formerly the ELCO Performing Arts Center, is a small theater located downtown. After being built in 1924 and undergoing two name changes, it became the ELCO in 1934. Ownership switched hands several times, but the end of the Lerner appeared to be in sight when owner William Miller died in 1987. In 1990, the city bought the theater to prevent further deterioration due to vacancy. Also, that year, some locals formed a commission to oversee the restoration. Funding issues led the city to get involved further in the form of getting a federal grant. The grant helped with major upgrades and the hiring of full-time staff.

The ELCO was renamed The Lerner when it reopened after an $18 million renovation and expansion in June 2011. It is now used for a wide range of concerts, special events, and local productions.

===Museums===
There are many different museums located in the city.

* Woodlawn Nature Center is a small natural history museum and activity center that includes 10 acres of woods.
* The Midwest Museum of American Art has over 6,000 works in its collection and offers 8-10 temporary showings per year.

* The Ruthmere Museum was the mansion once occupied by Albert R. and Elizabeth Baldwin Beardsley, the descendants of the city&#x27;s founder. This museum features a world-class fine arts collection and a historical recreation of the home as it was in the 1910s and 20s. 
* The Havilah Beardsley House is also part of the Ruthmere Museum Campus. Built in 1848, this home once belonged to the founder of Elkhart, Havilah Beardsley. Today, it has been restored to the style of the 1870s, at which time Havilah&#x27;s son, James Rufus Beardsley, gutted and remodeled the entire home into its current Italianate style.

===Events===
The Elkhart Jazz Festival is a three-day event that takes place in late June on the banks of the Elkhart River. It is known as one of the premier Jazz festivals in the nation. In 2007, the festival celebrated its 20th anniversary.

Also, the Elkhart Air Show was an annual event that took place at the Elkhart Municipal Airport at the end of July. It featured a wide variety of airplanes old and new. The event was canceled in 2007 due to financial issues. It is unclear whether the show is on hiatus or gone for good.

===Public library===

==Sports==
The Elkhart Miracle is a proposed independent minor league baseball team that was scheduled to begin to play in the Northern League in 2015. The stadium was to be located on the city&#x27;s southwest side on State Road 19. As of December 2017, the stadium had not yet been built, and the team was not formed, due to construction delays. As of May 2023, the team is playing out of NorthWood Field of Dreams in Nappanee, IN 

The Elkhart Express was a semi-professional men&#x27;s basketball team in the International Basketball League. Their home games were played at North Side Gymnasium, located inside Elkhart&#x27;s North Side Middle School. The franchise began operation in 2006 and won the International Title in 2006 and 2007. The Elkhart Express officially released news that they were folding under bankruptcy on January 5, 2009. In January 2010, head coach and founder Daimon Beathea announced that the Express would return for the 2010 season, but those plans never came to fruition.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Major roads====
Elkhart is located on the Indiana Toll Road (Interstates 80/90) at exits 92 and 96 and on the eastern portion of the St. Joseph Valley Parkway (U.S. Route 20) which bypasses the southern side of the city. State Road 19 runs through the city while U.S. Route 33 and State Road 120 terminate in the city. U.S. 33 used to run through the city, and that route was part of the original Lincoln Highway.

====Rail====
Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, serves the Elkhart Train Station. Two routes, the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; and &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot;, stop at the station, along the former New York Central Railroad line. The &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; connects Chicago to Washington, DC and the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; connects Chicago to New York City and Boston. Both lines connect to their eastern destinations via Cleveland with one train offered for each direction on each route daily.

====Airports====
Elkhart Municipal Airport (EKM) is located on the city&#x27;s northwest side. No commercial flights are offered, but two charter flight services operate out of the airport. South Bend International Airport (SBN) is the closest airport with commercial airline service.

The Mishawaka Pilots Club Airport (3C1) is just outside the southwest edge of the city of Elkhart. Mishawaka Pilots Club Airport is a privately owned, public-use facility.

====Interurban Trolley====
Elkhart is a central hub for the &quot;Interurban Trolley&quot; regional public bus service, which stops at various destinations throughout the city and connects it to neighboring Goshen, Osceola, Dunlap and Mishawaka. It was originally known as the BUS system. The system&#x27;s name is derived from its use of vintage-trolley-style buses that run between several different cities and towns, evoking the interurban train networks that were common in the United States during the first half of the 20th century. The Interurban Trolley operates each day, except Sundays or major holidays.

=====Connections to other transit systems=====
Bittersweet/Mishawaka Route links up with TRANSPO&#x27;s Route 9 in Mishawaka, which in turn connects riders to downtown South Bend and the South Shore Station, TRANSPO&#x27;s transit hub. North Pointe Route stops at Elkhart&#x27;s Greyhound station. Elkhart-Goshen and Concord route both stop near the Elkhart Train Station.

<text>Nappanee is a city in Elkhart and Kosciusko counties in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 6,648 as of the 2010 U.S. Census and had grown to 6,913 by the 2020 U.S. Census. The name Nappanee is thought to mean &quot;flour&quot; in the Algonquian language.

==History==
Several hundred years ago, the indigenous Mound Builders built their settlements in an area to the north of the city&#x27;s marshes. Pottawatomi arrived in the area from near Green Bay, Wisconsin in the 1700s, partially displacing the previous Miami inhabitants. The Pottawatomis had settlements on the Elkhart River at Elkhart, Goshen, and Waterford, and at Monoquet between Leesburg and Warsaw in what became Kosciusko County, Indiana. Thus, the Plymouth-Goshen Road near Nappanee probably follows the course of an old Indian Trail. The first European settlers came to the area in 1830, as various treaties and a process the Pottawatomi call the &quot;Trail of Death&quot; led to the relocation of Native Americans away from their traditional territories.

===Railroad town===

By 1870, seven farms had been established and forty people were settled around Nappanee. Locke Township had been founded in 1836 and named after Samuel Lockwood, and by 1863 a settlement called Wisler Town existed, but the actual platting of the village of Locke Town, approximately six miles from Nappanee, took place in December 1867. It would receive its last addition in 1874, the year that Nappanee was platted (on December 12, 1874).

The B&amp;O Railroad sought a route westward from Sandusky, Ohio to the booming inland port of Chicago, Illinois in 1872. While the land around what became Nappanee and nearby Bremen was flat, permitting a straight crossing from Walkerton, it was also marshy, which led to various engineering challenges. The section through Nappanee was finally completed as a single track in the late summer of 1874 and replaced by steel rails in 1882. Farmers sold the railroad land so that its tracks would run right next to Nappanee on its route to Chicago, although the railroad was unable to acquire the five acres needed to build a side track to the existing town of Locke. Nonetheless, on December 6, 1874, about three weeks after the railroad reached the outskirts of Chicago, it commenced service to what it first called Locke&#x27;s Station. By the month&#x27;s end, Daniel Metzler, Henry Stahly, and John Culp Jr. had platted the town of Nappanee; Culp gave the railroad three acres for a station and Metzler two acres. By 1875, trains arrived almost daily at the new depot and discharged freight and passengers. The Eby brothers of Locke said they suggested the name because they came from Napanee, Ontario; one of the Metzlers said their father selected the name in part because of its native American connotations. Over time the B&amp;O Railroad eventually became CSX.

===Development===

The town&#x27;s first industry was a sawmill, and later additions were box-making, charcoal, and furniture businesses. The first brickyard (using local resources) was established before 1879. The first canning company was established in 1894, and a hemp factory was built by 1913. The hemp factory never reached full capacity, and was burned down in 1920, not rebuilt. Mobile home construction had started in Elkhart and Goshen by World War II, and the Walco and Franklin Coach Company were built in Nappanee after the war. Once the land was cleared, corn and wheat were planted, and agriculture has long been important in the area. By the early 20th century, onions had become a major crop (inspiring an autumn festival), and other farmer-entrepreneurs grew hemp, spearmint and peppermint.

Nappanee was governed as a township from 1874 until 1889 when it incorporated as a town (then electing a town marshal and establishing a fire company and soon a waterworks). The town library was started as a ladies&#x27; subscription service in 1895 and became a public library in 1925 after sufficient building funds were amassed to purchase an existing house, although a dedicated building wasn&#x27;t opened until 1937. In 1895, some tried to establish a college in Nappanee, but unlike various fellowships and fraternal and literary societies, the proposal never was implemented. In 1925 Nappanee incorporated as a city.
Early in the 20th century, various Nappanee natives became noted cartoonists, including Merrill Blosser, , Bill Holman, Fred Neher and Henry Maust, and political cartoonist Francis (Mike) Parks was educated in Nappanee before working for New York, Omaha and San Francisco newspapers. A marker outside the public library notes Nappanee&#x27;s cartooning history.
The Frank and Katharine Coppes House, Downtown Nappanee Historic District, Arthur Miller House, Nappanee Eastside Historic District, Nappanee West Park and Pavilion, and Stahly-Nissley-Kuhns Farm are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

A tornado touched down in Nappanee around 10:30 PM on 18 October 2007, injuring at least five people and damaging 200 to 250 buildings, half of them severely. The tornado was classified as an EF3. The damage included three recreational vehicle factories that are among the community&#x27;s largest employers: Fairmont Homes, Franklin Coach, and Gulf Stream Coach.

===Amish migration to Nappanee===
The Amish religious group that broke off from the Mennonites was formed in 1525 in Switzerland as part of the Radical Reformation and quickly spread to Germany and the Netherlands. As a more radical branch of the wider Protestant Reformation against Catholic practices, the Mennonites were vigorously persecuted by religious and worldly authorities. During the last decade of the 17th century a group from the Mennonites led by Jakob Ammann separated to form the Amish group which was named after its leader.

During the 18th century, the Amish were attracted to the promise of religious freedom in William Penn&#x27;s colony and thus settled in Pennsylvania. Amish then migrated to Middlebury in 1841 coming from Holmes County, Ohio, where they had migrated to from Pennsylvania, starting in 1809. Nappanee&#x27;s Amish originate from the early Amish immigrants from southwest Germany, notably the Palatinate, to Pennsylvania in the middle of the 18th century.

Amish families who became Old Order Amish in the second half of the 19th century first arrived in southwest Elkhart County in the early 1840s, and various other religious conservative denominations followed them. The First Mennonite Church in the area was founded in 1854, but members worshiped in homes, then built a schoolhouse in 1867 and also used it for services for several years (as did other denominations with their permission).

The first permanent building was erected in 1878, two years after the United Brethren Church moved from the schoolhouse into its own building (only to sell it and build a new building in 1888 and remodel it in 1928). Nappanee is still surrounded by family farms of conservative Anabaptists, including the Amish, Mennonites, and the Schwarzenau Brethren.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, the city has a total area of of land.

Nappanee is now surrounded by fertile farmland as the headwaters of the Wabash River in northern Indiana, but initially was one of the least desirable areas of what became Elkhart County, due to dense woods and widespread swamps, particularly tamarack marshes. The water drains into two watersheds‚Äîprecipitation south of what became Market Street drains into the Wabash River, thence to the Ohio River, Mississippi River, and ultimately the Gulf of Mexico. Precipitation north of Market Street drains into the Great Lakes, and ultimately the St. Lawrence River and the Atlantic Ocean.

Many Amish and Mennonite families live in the area, employed in the farming industry as well as working in the recreational vehicle industry or woodworking trade. Following a devastating tornado in 2007, Nappanee suffered a sluggish economy and slow recovery, resulting in significant job losses for the city. It has since recovered. Since 2014, the town has been home to a major bus assembly plant owned by British maker Alexander Dennis.

<text>Wakarusa is a town in Harrison and Olive townships in Elkhart County, Indiana, United States. The population was 1,758 at the 2010 census.

Wakarusa is a small farming and manufacturing community located on Indiana 19 just north of Indiana 119. The town is south of Elkhart, southeast of South Bend, east of Chicago, and north of Indianapolis.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Wakarusa has a total area of , of which (or 96.62%) is land and (or 3.38%) is water.

==History==
In 1836, rural Olive Township was formed in western Elkhart County, and in 1849, as the population grew, a post office named Mt. Olive opened. After more population growth, a new village named Salem was established to prevent people from having to travel to either Goshen or Elkhart to conduct business. Since there is already a town named Salem in Indiana, the name was changed to Wakarusa in 1859. The Mt. Olive Post Office was renamed for Wakarusa a year later.

Railroad - In 1891 work began on the Wabash Railroad line through town, with the official opening of the line in the spring of 1893. The line, which connected Chicago with Montpelier, Ohio, became part of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway in 1964 and lasted until the 1980s. Today, the original Wabash depot along with two Norfolk &amp; Western rail cars are featured along with many other displays at the Wakarusa Historical Museum.

The etymology of the name &quot;Wakarusa&quot; is not known. According to tradition, the name &quot;Wakarusa&quot; is from a Native American language, meaning &quot;knee-deep in mud&quot;. A more recent source claims a settler named it after a location in Kansas.

==Economy==

Originally solely a farming community, a lumber mill opened in 1866. By the 1880s, several factories and businesses existed, despite the fact that the railroad would not roll into town until 1893. At one point, three different lumber mills operated in the town, though none exist today.

Today, Wakarusa continues to have a thriving farming economy and has two grain mills within the town&#x27;s limits. Wakarusa&#x27;s location in Elkhart County places it within a strong industrial area, and because of this, multiple manufacturers are located in the area. Recreational vehicle manufacturing, modular home manufacturing and custom truck production are the base of the industrial economy. Forest River employs nearly 600 in the RV industry.

It was announced in February 2012 that Utilimaster, a manufacturer of walk-in vans and commercial truck bodies, was moving all of its manufacturing and headquarters to nearby Bristol, about 20 minutes to the northeast in Elkhart County. Since then, RV company Forest River has purchased nearly all of the buildings and currently employs around 600 in Wakarusa.

On July 17, 2008, Monaco Coach Corporation announced the closing of its Wakarusa production plant and laid off its approximately 1400 workers. Since then, the massive complex has been bought by Thor Industries, and they are using it for multiple operations for some of their RV brands. Currently, they employ around 700.

Today, the historic town center has several antique shops, hair salons, a furniture store, a hardware store, a general contractor, a florist, an I.T. business, a mechanic, insurance companies, restaurants, and a dime store candy shop that sells locally made maple syrup and jumbo jelly beans to a small but growing number of regional tourists.

==Festivals==
Once a year, the town hosts the Maple Syrup Festival and holds a parade as well as other activities associated with small-town celebrations. The festival was started in 1969 by the then Chamber of Progress. Originally held in March, the festival now occurs during the end of April.

<text>Connersville is a city in Fayette County, Indiana, United States, east by southeast of Indianapolis. The population was 13,324 at the 2020 census. The city is the county seat of and the only incorporated town in the county. The city is in the center of a large rural area of east central Indiana; the nearest significant city is Richmond, to the northeast by road. Connersville is home to Fayette county&#x27;s only high school. The local economy relies on manufacturing, retail, and healthcare to sustain itself. However, there has been a consistent decline in both employment and population since the 1960s, placing it among the least affluent areas in the state of Indiana, as indicated by measures such as median household income and other economic indicators.

The city is among the oldest cities in Indiana and the former Indiana Territory, having been established in 1813 by its namesake, John Conner.

==History==

Connersville is named for settler John Conner, older brother of William Conner, an early Indiana settler and politician. There was also, at least through 1795, Connerstown, a small Shawnee village near Lancaster, Ohio, named for John&#x27;s father, Richard Conner.

===Whitewater Valley and pre-European inhabitants===

The Whitewater River valley running north-south through eastern Indiana and southwestern Ohio was created by the Late Wisconsin Glaciation ending 13,600 years ago. Fayette County was at the southern fringe of the glaciation at that time. The Ice Age was punctuated by several prolonged warm periods during which the glaciers disappeared entirely from the temperate latitudes and a climate similar to modern times or even warmer prevailed. The flood waters produced resulted in lakes; breaching of the lakes resulted in rivers and streams carving its hills and valleys.

In the Northwest Territory during the latter half of the 18th century, the Miami Indians were dominant in the region, but the Potawatomi and Shawnee had a significant presence. Delaware Indians, displaced from their eastern homelands by European settlement, migrated west and settled along the forks of the Whitewater River. The Whitewater and Ohio River valleys had also been inhabited earlier by other Native Americans called mound builders for their characteristic large burial mounds still in evidence.

The geological aspects of the Whitewater River Valley contributed to early settlement after defeat of the Delaware Indians by General Anthony Wayne at Fallen Timbers in 1794, followed on August 3, 1795, by the Treaty of Greenville ceding most of Ohio and a sliver of southeastern Indiana to the United States. The valley, running south and southeasterly from east central Indiana to the Ohio River Valley, provided a convenient conduit for migration through Fort Washington (Cincinnati) from points east, settlements on the Ohio River, and settlers from Kentucky to northern and central Indiana Territory. Squatters engaged in agriculture and trading were occupying federal lands well before land sales in Indiana Territory began in 1801. An Indian trail paralleled the river from the Ohio Valley northward to the forks, then went along the East Fork to Eli Creek, thence taking a northwesterly direction passing through what was later Connersville, and then on to the Delaware villages strung along the White River from north of modern-day Indianapolis to modern Muncie.

===Conner&#x27;s Post===
John Conner, his brother William, and others arrived in the Whitewater Valley from south central Ohio in 1802, establishing a fur trading post in an unpopulated area near what was later to become Cedar Grove on the Whitewater River (Franklin County) at the very fringe of the European penetration into the wilderness of Indiana. By 1808, as a result of reduction of Indian hunting grounds by treaty, the trading post, known as &quot;Conner&#x27;s Post&quot;, had been relocated north at the Whitewater River junction with an Indian trail between the Ohio River to the southeast and hunting grounds to the north. According to research by J. L. Heineman, the trading post was located in the middle of what is now Eastern Avenue, at the west end of Charles Street. At that time, the region was inhabited by Delaware Indians. In 1809, the Treaty of Fort Wayne was signed, by the terms of which the land locally known as the &quot;Twelve Mile Purchase&quot; was ceded by the Indians to the government. This tract included a strip in width lying west of the 1795 Greenville treaty line that ran from the midpoint of the Indiana/Ohio border southwest to the Ohio River, cutting off a thin wedge of southeastern Indiana. The strip included most of Fayette County except the extreme northern portion (part of the later &quot;New Purchase&quot;). Sales of public land by the United States government in Indiana began in 1801. In that year the Cincinnati, Ohio, Land Office began selling land in a wedge of government land in southeastern Indiana known as the &quot;Gore&quot; (organized as Dearborn County in 1803) which included all of what became Fayette County. Conner obtained title to his plat in 1811.

===First 50 years ‚Äì through the Civil War===
The exodus of the Delaware Indians from Indiana after the War of 1812, completed by June 1813, deprived John Conner of his field for trading. After 1812, Indian resistance to settlement in the Indiana Territory became nearly non-existent, so Conner busied himself with another task.

John Conner laid out the town on the north side of the west fork of the Whitewater River in March 1813, adjacent to the fur trading post. The original plat was for 62 lots bounded by what are today Central Avenue to the west and Water Street to the east, Third Street to the south, and Sixth Street to the north. The first constructions in the town were a saw mill and grist mill north of town utilizing water power, and a general store and distillery in town. The influx of settlers was initially sparse ‚Äì as late as 1815, there were only four cabins in the town. The boundary lines for Fayette County were established in December 1818, and Connersville was chosen as the county seat.

Conner served briefly as sheriff of the newly organized Fayette County. In 1820, he helped plat the new capital of Indianapolis, and in 1822 relocated his fur trading business to Noblesville, north of Indianapolis. He also served as state senator and representative. He died in Indianapolis in April 1826 and was buried there. No trace remains of his grave.

The first post office in Connersville opened in January, 1818. The first courthouse was started in 1819 and finished in 1822. The first newspaper, the &quot;Indiana Statesman&quot;, was started in 1824. The first church in the village was Presbyterian, constructed in 1824. A seminary building was constructed in 1828, later razed, and the first regular school building in Connersville was constructed on the site in 1858. The &quot;Indiana Gazetteer&quot; in 1833 stated the population of Connersville as 500. The village was incorporated as a town in 1841. Connersville served as an important link on the Whitewater Canal that opened in1847and connected the Whitewater River and the Ohio River. The canal ceased to be used for through traffic in 1849, though limited local commerce continued. The first railroad, the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Indianapolis Railroad, reached Connersville in 1862. It extended from Rushville through Connersville and Oxford to Hamilton, Ohio.

For many years prior to the Civil War, and even for some time after, the main industries of the town were milling, pork packing, and woolen manufacturing.

In 1857, a separate village, East Connersville, was platted on the south bank of the west fork of the Whitewater River, and had its own government. It was annexed by Connersville some time in the 1920s.

===Early growth ‚Äì pre-industrial age===
The Roots blower, a type of air turbine, was invented by the Roots brothers in Connersville in the 1850s, patented in 1859, and manufactured in Connersville for over 150 years.

The town of Connersville became a chartered city in June 1869, and William H. Beck was chosen as its first mayor. The first high school opened in 1875. In 1882, James H. Fearis of Connersville started the Bell telephone exchange. The Connersville Electric Light Company commenced operations in August 1890 as the first supplier of electric power in the city. Central Avenue was paved with brick in 1902, and became the first paved street in the city.

Prior to the advent of automotive manufacturing, Connersville for decades was colloquially known as the &quot;furniture and buggy town&quot; because of the dominance of those two industries in the town.

In 1898, Stant was founded in Connersville, and became the world&#x27;s largest producer of piano tuning pins.

During the school year 1906‚Äì07, Dr. W. Otto Miessner established the first public high school band in the U.S. at Connersville High School.

===Automotive and industrial age to 1960s===
In the early 20th century, the town became known as &quot;Little Detroit&quot; because of its importance to the automobile industry, with over 500,000 jeep bodies produced in the town during the Second World War. Automobile manufacturing in Connersville began as early as 1909 and included Auburn, Cord, Duesenberg, Ansted, Empire, Lexington, and McFarlan. The Willys MB Jeep body was manufactured in Connersville during the 1940s. Much of the western portion of town was occupied by light industry for the 150 years prior to 1990. Companies included Roots Blower (later Dresser Industries), Stant, McQuay-Norris, Design &amp; Manufacturing Co. (D&amp;M), H. H. Robertson, Visteon, and Philco Ford.

McQuay-Norris, manufacturer of auto parts based in St. Louis, got its start in Connersville in 1921 by the acquisition of Wainwright Engineering, a privately held local company manufacturing automotive engines. In 1969, it was acquired by Eaton, Yale &amp; Towne, and closed its Connersville and Indianapolis plants in 1983.

Design &amp; Manufacturing (D&amp;M) company got its start when Rex Regenstrief purchased American Kitchens in 1958 and renamed the company. By 1972, D&amp;M controlled 25% of the nation‚Äôs dishwasher market. Design &amp; Manufacturing‚Äôs assets were sold to White Consolidated Industries in 1987 and the firm was dissolved in 1990.

Architectural Products Division of H. H. Robertson purchased land owned by the defunct Lexington Motor Car Company in February 1960. Robertson was a victim of hard times for the industry in the late 1980s and the Connersville plant was merged with operations in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, starting in 1986.

===Decline from 1960s onward===
The 1980s were the beginning of the end for Connersville automotive manufacturing, which had been on the wane for more than a decade. Due to high cost of local union labor and economies of scale elsewhere, most industry departed in the 1980s and 1990s. Connersville union labor decreased from a high of 10,000 to about 600 workers in 2012. Connersville‚Äôs role in automobile manufacturing ceased when the Visteon factory shut down in 2007. Part of the decline may be logistical ‚Äì with the construction of the interstate highway system in the 1950s, Connersville found itself not directly in line with routes between major cities: Interstate 70 from Indianapolis to Columbus, Ohio, Interstate 74 from Indianapolis to Cincinnati, and U.S. Route 40 from Indianapolis to Richmond, none intersecting Connersville. The former Roots Blower/Dresser Industries, now GE Energy, remains, but with a skeleton staff of fewer than 100 full-time employees. Stant also remains with a little over 200 employees. There are still some furniture making, machine shops, and other local manufacturing establishments.

In March 2014, the city declared a fiscal emergency when revenue fell short of expenses, and the city nearly fell into bankruptcy.

<doc id="112245" wikidata="Q507585" url="?curid=112245" title="Greenville, Indiana">
<text>Greenville is an incorporated town in Floyd County, Indiana. The population was 595 at the 2010 census. Greenville is located in the greater Louisville metropolitan area.

== History ==
=== Founding ===
Greenville was platted in 1816 by Andrew Mundell and Benjamin Haines some three years before Floyd County was established. During the first three years of Greenville&#x27;s development, the village was a part of Clark County.

=== Notable people ===

==== John Baptiste Ford ====
Captain John Baptiste Ford found his way to Greenville as a 14-year-old runaway from Danville, Kentucky. Ford began as an apprentice with his future father-in-law in the local saddle shop which led him into his first business venture. Ford purchased the &quot;Old Mill&quot; and saddle shop from its owner, added a grocery and began making tin pie safes which he sold throughout the country. Later, Ford moved to New Albany and established several businesses, and became the first man to succeed in making plate glass in the United States. That success was the precursor to several glass companies, most notably the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company now known as PPG. Ford became the father of American plate glass.

That original building that housed the mill, saddle shop and grocery still stands today. Historically referred to as the &quot;Old Mill&quot; and &quot;Ford&#x27;s Flour Mill&quot;, the Greenville Station is believed to be the oldest commercial building in Greenville. Construction on the original wooden structure began in 1810 and finished in 1812. In 1840, Ford helped to erect the present brick structure. Besides housing Ford&#x27;s grocery and the saddle shop, the &quot;Old Mill&quot; was the Greenville Post Office from 1823 until the early 1940s when it was relocated to H. Miller&#x27;s house at the corner of East First Street and Hwy 150. The Station was a stop for the 104-mile stagecoach route that ran from Falls Cities to the Wabash River. The building also served as a stop along the Pony Express route from 1861 to 1867. The Greenville Station served as lodge hall for two civil organizations: the fraternal order of the Free and Accepted Masons and the International Order of Oddfellows. Through a majority of the early 20th century, the Greenville Station was referred to by the townspeople as the &quot;lodge building&quot; or the &quot;lodge.&quot;

Ford was on the board for the Floyd County Seminary from 1850 - 1852. Ford was a philanthropist and always gave back to the community even after he left Greenville. He paid for the construction of the Simpson Memorial United Methodist Church in 1899. In 2017, the Greenville Town Council named a road &quot;John Baptiste Ford Drive&quot; to honor Ford&#x27;s history and significant contributions to both the community and industrialism. The Greenville Historic Preservation Commission had a historic marker approved by the Indiana Historic Bureau in 2019. The historic marker is the only John B. Ford specific historic marker in the country and the first IHB approved marker in Floyd County outside of New Albany.

===Civil War===

Morgan&#x27;s Raid came through Greenville on July 10, 1863, led by Confederate General John Hunt Morgan. After the Battle of Corydon, Morgan sent a column of troops through Greenville. Confederate troops were reported east of Greenville, at eight o&#x27;clock, and some of the scouts burned the railroad bridge at Farrabee Station, fifteen miles further north, at ten o&#x27;clock.

Greenville resident Ephraim L. Girdner enlisted with the Union Army in 1861. He was captured by the Confederates during the Battle of Richmond in 1862, he was promoted to Captain of his regiment in 1864, and was also part of Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea engaging is several battles along the way. Much of Girdner&#x27;s communications and military documents during the Civil War were preserved by his family and donated as the &quot;Girdner Papers&quot; to the library at Emory University in Atlanta.

===County Seat===
Early in Floyd County&#x27;s history, Greenville was initially to be the county seat. It was proposed that either New Albany or Greenville would become the county seat. The contest was left up to who could make the largest donation. The contest was animated but New Albany added the donation of a bell for the court house. The offer of the bell was irresistible and vanquished Greenville from the contest.

===Incorporation===
Greenville was surveyed by George Smith, county surveyor, and incorporated October 28, 1879.

===Fire of 1908===
On March 26, 1908, a fire destroyed most of the town&#x27;s original buildings. Today, the Station stands just two doors from one of the city&#x27;s oldest home (rebuilt in 1908), which still boasts some of John B. Ford&#x27;s original plate glass works.

===The Town Flag===
The Greenville Town Flag was designed by Glenn Burkhart in 1969, then just a 5th grader at Greenville Elementary School. The design was part of a contest held by the Greenville Town Council and the Greenville Park Board. Glenn received a $25 bond as a prize for winning the contest. His original drawing and the original flag from 1969 have been preserved. The Greenville Historic Preservation Commission held a flag re-dedication ceremony in January 2019 for the Flag&#x27;s 50 year anniversary.

<text>New Albany is a city in Floyd County, Indiana, United States, situated along the Ohio River, opposite Louisville, Kentucky. The population was 37,841 as of the 2020 census. The city is the county seat of Floyd County. It is bounded by I-265 to the north and the Ohio River to the south, and is considered part of the Louisville metropolitan area. The mayor of New Albany is Jeff Gahan, a Democrat; he was re-elected in 2023.

==History==

===Early history===

The land of New Albany was officially granted to the United States after the American Revolutionary War. The territory had been captured by George Rogers Clark in 1779. For his services Clark was awarded large tracts of land in Southern Indiana including most of Floyd County. After the war, Clark sold and distributed some of his land to his fellow soldiers. The area of New Albany ended up in the possession of Col. John Paul.

New Albany was founded in July 1813 when three brothers from New York ‚ÄîJoel, Abner, and Nathaniel Scribner‚Äîarrived at the Falls of the Ohio and named the site after the city of Albany, New York. They purchased the land from Col. John Paul. New Albany was platted by John Graham on land owned by the Scribner brothers. In 1814, Joel and Mary Scribner built their home in New Albany; the Scribner House still stands today.

New Albany was incorporated as a town in 1817 as part of Clark County. In 1819, three years after Indiana was admitted as a state, New Albany became the seat of government for newly established Floyd County. A courthouse was finally built in 1824.

New Albany grew rapidly and was the largest city in Indiana from 1816 until 1860, when it was overtaken by Indianapolis. Before the Civil War, over half of Hoosiers worth over $100,000 (~$ in ) lived in New Albany, making it by far the wealthiest part of the state. The steamboat industry was the engine of the city&#x27;s economy during the mid-19th century. Fueled by abundant forests for lumber, at least a half-dozen shipbuilders were in operation and turned out a multitude of steamboats and packet boats, including the &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot;, &quot;Eliza Battle&quot;, the &quot;Eclipse&quot;, and the &quot;A.A. Shotwell&quot;. Shipbuilding was accompanied by a wide range of ancillary business including machine shops, foundries, cabinet and furniture factories, and silversmith shops. Its second largest business was the American Plate Glass Works.

In 1847, the city was connected to the port at Michigan City, Indiana on Lake Michigan via the Monon railroad. In 1853, the New Albany High School opened, the first public high school in the state. The original school was built at the corner of West First Street and Spring Street. New Albany would also be the first in the state to create a consolidated school district several years later.

Ashbel P. Willard, governor of the state of Indiana, dedicated the Floyd County Fairgrounds in 1859. That year, the Indiana State Fair was held in New Albany. During the Civil War, the fairgrounds were converted to become Camp Noble and used as a muster point for the area&#x27;s regiments.

===Civil War===
During the American Civil War, New Albany served as both a supply center for Union troops and as a medical care center for wounded soldiers. Up to 1,500 wounded soldiers were treated in New Albany during the war, and many non-medical buildings were converted into makeshift hospitals. 
In 1862, Abraham Lincoln established one of the first seven national cemeteries in New Albany for burying the many war dead. Despite the ongoing war, a new courthouse was built in 1865, which was used until the 1960s, when the current City-County courthouse was constructed, also the first in Indiana.

The Town Clock Church, now the Second Baptist Church, was used as the New Albany stop in the Underground Railroad. The original steeple was destroyed by a lightning strike in 1915, and a new replica steeple was not completed until 101 years later in 2016.

During the Civil War, New Albany businesses were boycotted by Confederates because it was in a Union state and by the North because it was considered too friendly to the South. Indianapolis overtook New Albany as Indiana&#x27;s largest city in 1860, and across the river, Louisville&#x27;s population grew much faster. New Albany never regained its original stature. The once robust steamboat industry ended by 1870, with the last steamboat built in New Albany named, appropriately, the &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot;.

During the second half of the 19th century, New Albany experienced an industrial boom despite the collapse of the steamboat industry. The advent of railroads created economic opportunity for the city as a pork packing and locomotive repair center. A bridge was built across the Ohio River in 1886, providing a rail and road connection with Kentucky. American Plate Glass Works opened in 1865 and employed as many as 2,000 workers. When the factory relocated in 1893, New Albany lost a large part of its population and went into economic decline.

===20th century===

In the early 20th century, New Albany became a center of plywood and veneer manufacturing, and its largest employer was the New Albany Veneering Company. By 1920, New Albany was the largest producer of plywood and veneer in the world, with other producers including Indiana Veneer Panel Company and Hoosier Panel Company.

On March 23, 1917, a tornado struck the north side of New Albany, killing at least 46 people.

Interstate 64 was built through New Albany in 1961 and led to the construction of the Sherman Minton Bridge. The project cost $14.8 million. The bridge was named for U.S. Senator and later U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sherman Minton, who was a native of nearby Georgetown and practiced law in New Albany. The bridge was named the &quot;most beautiful long-span bridge of 1961&quot; by the American Institute of Steel Construction.

====Education innovation====
Charles A. Prosser lived in New Albany for much of his life. Charles Allen Prosser School of Technology was named in honor of his accomplishments as the &quot;father of vocational education.&quot;
In the mid and late 20th century, New Albany became an innovator in using electronic media in education. New Albany High School, a public school, started WNAS-FM in 1949, which is the nation&#x27;s oldest continuously operating high school radio station. In the late 1960s, Slate Run Elementary School started WSRS, a non-licensed student-produced closed-circuit television service for its classrooms, one of the nation&#x27;s first in an elementary school.

====Ohio River flood====
In January 1937, a major flood struck the region. New Albany, like the other river towns, had no flood walls and no methods of regulating the river. The Ohio River rose to 60.8 feet at New Albany, leaving most of the town under 10 or more feet of water for nearly three weeks. The flood was the worst disaster to befall the city.

After the flood, New Albany was the first city in the region to begin construction on massive flood walls around the city. New Albany&#x27;s flood walls served as examples for those constructed around Louisville and Clark County.

<text>Attica is a city in Logan Township, Fountain County, Indiana, United States.

==History==
Attica was laid out by George Hollingsworth and platted by David Stump in 1825. The completion of the Wabash and Erie Canal through the town in 1847 brought a considerable amount of growth to the area, and ended (in Attica&#x27;s favor) a long-standing rivalry with the neighboring communities of Rob Roy, Williamsport and Covington.

Attica is the nearest town to the location where Paul Dresser is believed to have written the state song, &quot;On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away&quot;, in 1897, and the bridge over the Wabash River bears his name.

The growth of Attica led to its inclusion of neighboring unincorporated communities such as Vine, for which a post office has been established in 1895, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1900. According to one source, the name Vine had been chosen for its brevity. Modernly, the location is marked by the southern termination of North Vine School Road.

<text>Covington is a city in, and the county seat of, Fountain County, Indiana, United States. The population was 2,645 at the 2010 census.

==History==

Fountain County was formed on April 1, 1826. Later that year, the county seat was established at Covington, and a two-story frame courthouse was built in 1827. The location of the county seat was a point of contention for some years, as Covington was not centrally located in the county. In 1831 an act was passed that called for the relocation of the county seat, but after further discussion it was decided that it should remain where it was. Eventually the coming of the railroads helped to alleviate the geographical concern. A brick courthouse was completed in 1833.

<text>Wallace, originally named Jacksonville, is a town located in Jackson Township, Fountain County, Indiana, United States. At the 2010 census, the town had a total population of 105.

== History ==
Jacksonville, one of Fountain County&#x27;s early settlements, was established by John Bowman and his father Henry in the early 1830s on land situated just north of Mill Creek and was named for Andrew Jackson. The town&#x27;s name in informal speech was often shortened to &quot;Jackville&quot;. The first settler at the site was Richard Williams who erected a cabin as early as 1826, several years before the town was laid out, with the first house erected after Jacksonville&#x27;s platting belonging to William Guilliams. By the 1880s, it contained about two dozen houses.

Early tradesmen in Jacksonville included William Snooks, the township&#x27;s first blacksmith, Samuel Glass who operated a house of entertainment, shoemaker Alvah Doke, cabinet-maker George McCline, physicians Dr. Reeves, Dr. A. M. C. Hawes and Dr. Joseph Roberts and various general storekeepers. An 1881 history offers the following description of the town&#x27;s businesses:
In comparatively recent times Noah and Charles Grimes, Bayless and Jacob Carter, ‚Äî Cunningham &amp; Smith, and several others, had stores. The present dealers are John Murphy, David Oliver, and Johnson Clore. Henry Newlin is selling drugs. His predecessor in this business was W. H. Spinning. A blacksmith and a chair shop are in this place, and a house which welcomes the hungry traveler and jaded animal with entertainment is also to be found. Somebody with business sagacity keeps constantly on hand a stock of coffins as a sign that there are two doctors in the village.
The town gained a post office during the administration of Indiana Governor David Wallace, and was named by John Bowman and Judge Mitchell C. Black in the governor&#x27;s honor. The town itself later assumed this name. Bowman was the office&#x27;s first postmaster and Black the first mailcarrier.

In 1950, the list of merchants in Wallace included; Ira Wilkinson General Store, J. W. Grimes Grocery (which also housed the post office), Ralph Myers TV and Appliances, Carl Starnes Insurance, Uplinger Cafe, Paul Mitchell Barber Shop, McGinnis Garage, Clores Grocery and Lunch, Ellingwood&#x27;s Lumber Yard, Alward&#x27;s Skelgas Service and the office of H. M. Rusk physician. A blacksmith shop and food processing plant were also present. The Wallace School, grades 1 through 12, served all of Jackson Township.

<doc id="112255" wikidata="Q2788730" url="?curid=112255" title="Batesville, Indiana">
<text>Batesville is a city in Ripley and Franklin counties in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 7,202 at the 2020 census, making it the largest community in both counties but is not the county seat of either. The Batesville Casket Company is headquartered here. Batesville is noted for its central location between Indianapolis, Cincinnati, and Louisville.

==History==
Central Batesville Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.

===Beginning===
Batesville was founded by George H. Dunn, owner of the John Callahan Trust Company. The company bought land and created new towns along rail lines that it began since Dunn was president of the Cincinnati and Indianapolis Railroad. Joshua Bates, who platted the town of Batesville, is thought to be the source of the name. On November 1, 1853, the first train from Cincinnati to Indianapolis passed through Batesville.

===Development===
Once the railway opened, Dunn and Bates constructed more buildings. George Sims laid out Batesville&#x27;s first addition in 1858. The following year, German immigrant Henry Boehringer became Batesville&#x27;s first major builder. A three-story building with a basement on East Pearl Street (formerly known as Broadway Street) became known as the Boehringer Hall because of the dance floor on the third story. The Catholic congregation used the basement before they had built their church.

Louis Walter established Batesville&#x27;s first gristmill in 1858. Between 1860 and 1870, Boehringer built a row of apartments and homes on the north side of Batesville on Boehringer Street. Along with building the apartments and housing, Boehringer owned the lot where the Ward School now stands. In 1863 Conrad Rapp purchased numerous lots on East Broadway and bought Walter&#x27;s gristmill. In 1865, John Brinkman built a hotel and restaurant called the Sherman House, named after William Tecumseh Sherman, a major general that led the Union Army to its final victory of the Civil War in a campaign that became known as &quot;Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea&quot;.

Sebastian Messersmith built Union Hall in 1865. It was a two-story building on the west side of Main Street (Batesville, Indiana)|Main Street and just north of South Street (Batesville, Indiana)|South Street. Union Hall was used by the fire department for meetings and it was used by the public school while the school building was being rebuilt. It was also used as a boarding house for mill workers and visiting lumber salesman. This was an important building to the citizens of Batesville. Batesville has been known for its many factories built between the 1870s and the present.

In 1873 the Greeman Bracket Company began manufacturing under the Greeman family name, which was one of the leading businesses for 30 years. The Schrader Furniture Factory was built in 1873, but had to be rebuilt in 1875 after the factory was destroyed by a fire. When the founder Herman Schrader died, the business was bought by John Hillenbrand|John and William Hillenbrand. In 1874, the Union Furniture Factory also burned down and the Blank Bros. Furniture Manufacturing Company was erected the following year. Also, in 1879, Batesville published its first newspaper, &quot;The Prairie Farmer&quot;.

During the 1880s the town of Batesville started its first form of government appointed by the community. The first mayor was George M. Hillenbrand. The first town board served without pay. The board consisted of five officers: Jacob Blank Jr., John Lehmkuehler, John Hillenbrand, William Hillenbrand, and Christian Schwieler. Much of the money that was put toward the town came directly out of the officers&#x27; pockets. For example, in February 1883, they donated $153.06 to go toward paying for the town&#x27;s bills. By September, when the financial report was reviewed, Batesville only had $1.82 in its account. Also during 1883, Batesville began major road construction.

In 1884 Batesville organized the Batesville Casket Company. It was managed by J. Spiegel and later purchased by George M. Hillenbrand in February 1906. Also in 1884, the town jail was completed at a cost of $211.55. The inmates were forced to break stone to pay for their stay in the prison.

Several developments took place in 1887, including new additions to the town and telephone connections to the town of Oldenburg. These developments were funded by a grant applied for by Mr. Haverkos. Also in 1887, John Hillenbrand and Victor Oberting opened a stone quarry on some of Mr. Hillenbrand&#x27;s land near Batesville. In December 1887, the town hall was completed. The town hall was separated into two parts: one for the town board and the other for the fire company. The town hall was also rented out for public gatherings.

In March 1888, the school board made a decision to construct an addition onto the schoolhouse. This proposal estimated that the total cost of the addition would be $1,500. Also in 1888, the first city attorney (James H. Connelly) was appointed at a salary of $35 per year, and many new businesses were added. In this year, Henry F. E. Schrader moved to Batesville and opened a tin shop and built homes. Also, Henry H. Kramer started a grocery store on the corner of Walnut and Boehringer. As well as new stores, a covered bridge was built over the Laughery Creek, making travel much easier.

In 1889, Batesville finally paved its roads with stone that came from the Hillenbrand and Oberting Stone Quarry. As well as the paving of the roads, Batesville opened the Batesville State Bank. In February 1890, Batesville had built its first sidewalks. Also in the 1890s, street lamps were introduced to Batesville. Originally, these lamps were oil lamps. However, in October, a proposal was written to turn them all into electric lamps, but the proposal was denied. On January 29, 1894, the first electric lamp was placed in front of Town Hall.

In 1895 a petition was written and accepted to build another school. The total estimated cost would be $5,700. The land would cost $700 and the school building would cost $5,000. In 1897 Batesville decided to stop the use of the electric lamps because of the rates that people had to pay to keep them going, but then in 1898 Batesville decided that they would reduce the rates and only use the lamps when needed.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Batesville has a total area of , of which (or 98.93%) is land and (or 1.07%) is water.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Batesville has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Economy==

Like Princeton, Fort Branch is also largely a blue-collar town although of somewhat smaller size. For a long time the town&#x27;s largest employer was the Emge Foods processing and packing plant, still located along the southwest portion of the town. When the plant closed in May 1999, it had been in operation for nearly 90 years.

As the Emge plant was starting to close, Toyota announced that it would be building a manufacturing facility on a patch of farmland located halfway between Fort Branch and nearby Princeton. While most of the suppliers for the new Toyota plant are located closer to Princeton, most of the population gains from employees moving closer to work moved into either Fort Branch, or into Haubstadt or Owensville.
Recently, Vincennes University announced plans to build an advanced manufacturing education facility just south of Fort Branch along U.S. 41 to provide such education to an area becoming more diverse in manufacturing methods. This is expected to provide a major boost to lifestyle in the Fort Branch-Haubstadt Area. Ground Broke on the new facility on October 23, 2009. The facility opened in August 2011.

On June 18, 2010, a fire started at the former Emge Foods plant. By June 22, the fire had destroyed the vacant meat processing plant portion of the complex but was put out. Fire departments from three counties battled to control the fire, dealing with the unstable structure of the 100+-year-old building and the 95+-degree temperatures that occurred during the five-day period the fire burned. As of February 2014, only the smokestack remains of the plant, with the remains being demolished along with the original water tower between September 2013 and January 2014. As of December 2014, there are no known plans for the future of the property.

==Notable person==

Its heyday was in the mid-1850s during use of the ill-fated canal to ship goods and produce south to Evansville. Mills, grain warehouses and packing establishments thrived during the decade. Remnants of the old canal are still visible just south of Highway 64 and west of town.

The Lions Club pictured in the Gallery at the bottom of this page was built to serve as grades 5-8 during construction of a new school. Also used for classroom space was the Methodist, Baptist and Nazarene churches.

A small one-room school house once stood near the intersection of Green and School Streets and is why today the current school is not even located on the same side of town as School Street.

==Other points of interest==
Wabash &amp; Erie Canal

Francisco was a town built on the East Banks of the Wabash and Erie Canal. The Manmade Canal ran from Lake Erie in Ohio to the Ohio River at Evansville. Francisco was home to many Rowdy Irishmen who came to help build the canal. The Heyday for the Wabash &amp; Erie Canal was mid-1850s and the canal was closed to traffic around 1870.

A large outbreak of cholera broke out among canal workers near Francisco around 1852; as many as 100 workers died and many more fled from the area. Those who stayed and survived were assigned the task of burying the dead. Many were buried along the banks in long trenches, while others were burnt in piles on the floor of small shanties along the canal.

Drinking establishments or Doggeries were popular among canal workers and in that day were very prominent around Francisco. Whiskey was supplied by &quot;Jigger Bosses&quot; to workers four times a day and caused many fights among the Irish and Americans. The Irish were generally assigned to digging with shovels, while Americans built culverts and bridges.

<text>Haubstadt is the second largest town, after Fort Branch, and fourth largest community in Gibson County, Indiana, United States. The population was 1,638 at the 2020 census. Haubstadt has recently become a bedroom community of Evansville and such, is part of the Evansville, Indiana, Metropolitan Area.

==History==
Haubstadt was originally called Haub&#x27;s Station, and under the latter name, meaning &quot;Haub town&quot; in German, was laid out in 1855. Named after an early settler, Henry Haub, the town was incorporated in 1913.

Haub built the community&#x27;s first home, combining a stagecoach shop, general store, and trading post to accommodate travelers on the Noon Day Stage Coach route running to Vincennes. A dance hall was later also built above Mr. Haub&#x27;s tavern and store, and the complex would later become known as The Log Inn, the area&#x27;s famous restaurant. The Log Inn is officially recognized as the oldest restaurant in Indiana.

The Haubstadt State Bank (now Town Hall) was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

=== Haubstadt Train Wreck of 1990 ===
On June 14, 1990, a train, operated by Jacksonville, Florida-based CSX Transportation, was coming into Haubstadt from the south and around 7:00pm suddenly there was a large crash followed by a lightning-like flash from an electric pole accompanied by a thunderclap and a town-wide power failure. It did not take long for people to realize that a train had de-railed. In the derailment, at least five buildings, most of downtown and much of Haubstadt&#x27;s history was destroyed in about ten seconds. When it was later learned the train was possibly carrying ammonia, Haubstadt was mostly evacuated, mainly by people with respiratory illnesses such as asthma. It was later found that the ammonia cars were empty and that the smell was residue that was released into the air. It was also discovered that the tracks had not been maintained properly and that a couple of loose ties coupled with the speed at which the trains move through Haubstadt and neighboring Fort Branch (between 55 - 65¬†mph) were to blame for the accident. There is fear among many in Haubstadt and nearby Fort Branch and Princeton that a worse train wreck may occur as the track&#x27;s speed limit was increased to 70¬†mph from Princeton to Darmstadt in 2000.
==Geography==

According to the 2010 census, Haubstadt has a total area of , of which (or 98.59%) is land and (or 1.41%) is water.

Haubstadt has several schools, including Haubstadt Community School (or HCS), Saints Peter and Paul (or Sts. P&amp;P), and Saint James, located approximately 2 miles south of town.

The Haubstadt area has two catholic churches, Saint James and Saints Peter &amp; Paul, both having their own K-8 schools, plus several smaller churches scattered in town or around the surrounding Johnson Township.

<text>Hazleton is a town in White River Township, Gibson County, Indiana, United States. The population was 263 at the 2010 census making it the second smallest community in the county. While having almost no connection to it, it is part of the Evansville, Indiana, Metropolitan Area.

==History==
Hazleton is the second-oldest town in Gibson County after Patoka. It was named in honor of Gervas Hazleton, believed to be the second settler to permanently locate to the county. Hazleton first lived in a crude camp lit by large log fires that was a popular stopover for early migrants to the area.

The town was platted in 1856 by Lucius French. T. S. Fuller erected the town&#x27;s first frame building, and John Breedlove built the town&#x27;s blacksmith shop. The first steamboat of any note to travel up the White River was the &quot;Cleopatria&quot; in 1884.

On March 10, 1897, a passenger train of the Evansville and Terre Haute Railroad (now the Chicago &amp; Eastern Illinois) wrecked near Hazleton. An embankment which carried the tracks past the White River had been weakened by the river&#x27;s flood waters, and collapsed under the weight of the train, causing it to derail. Around a dozen people are believed to have been killed, though most bodies were never found.

==Geography==

In 1965, that school in turn merged into Princeton Community High School. Nathan Blackford of &quot;Evansville Living&quot; described White River High as &quot;Possibly the shortest-lived high school of the consolidation era&quot; as many school districts and schools in 1960s Indiana were merging with one another.

==Economy==

Unlike Princeton and Fort Branch, Owensville&#x27;s economy practically consists of a scant few family-owned business with only three exceptions: Goodlettsville, Tennessee-based Dollar General, Mount Carmel, Illinois-based Community Natural Gas, and Mount Vernon, Indiana-based Schultheis Insurance. The largest family-owned business in Owensville is Holder&#x27;s Furniture. However, like Fort Branch, Owensville is largely surrounded by unincorporated subdivisions, primarily north of the town. The two largest employers of Owensville&#x27;s residents are the Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indiana plant located halfway between Princeton and Fort Branch, as well as Gibson Generating Station located 5.5 miles north-northwest of Owensville, as well two coal mines that opened up in 2008 and 2014, located 6 miles and 1 mile north of town respectively.

Like the other communities in Gibson County, Owensville&#x27;s prime economy is based on agriculture. The farms immediately around the town primarily produce corn, soybeans, strawberries, and wheat. Like many other communities along the Lower Wabash Valley, the surrounding Montgomery Township is particularly known for its watermelons, pumpkins, squash, cantaloupes, and zucchini, all heavily produced in the sandy bottom grounds located from the north to the southwest of the town. In addition, milo tends to be produced in place of corn in areas prone to flooding from the Wabash, Patoka, or Black Rivers or any of the other smaller creeks or streams that flow into them.

Owensville High School, which merged with Fort Branch and Haubstadt high schools to form Gibson Southern, had the first high school gymnasium in Indiana with a glass backboard. One of those backboards is now in the Indiana High School Basketball Hall of Fame in New Castle, Indiana.
