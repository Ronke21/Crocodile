<text>LaGrange is a city in and the county seat of Troup County, Georgia, United States. The population of the city was estimated to be 30,858 in 2020 by the U.S. Census Bureau. It is the principal city of the LaGrange, Georgia Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Gainesville, Georgia-Alabama (part) combined statistical area. It is about southwest of Atlanta and located in the foothills of the Georgia Piedmont.

LaGrange is home to LaGrange College, the oldest private college in the state. Started as a girls&#x27; academy, it has been affiliated since the late 19th century with the Methodist Church, and what is now the North Georgia Conference of the United Methodist Church. The city&#x27;s proximity to West Point Lake, a few miles to the west, helps attract bass fishermen and water sports enthusiasts to the city.

The Troup County Courthouse, Annex, and Jail, built in 1939, is one of LaGrange&#x27;s properties that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==

LaGrange is named after the country estate near Paris of the wife of the Marquis de La Fayette. When La Fayette, a Revolutionary War hero, visited Georgia in 1825 on a national tour, he remarked on the similarity of local topography to his wife&#x27;s property.

The European-American settlement of LaGrange began in the early 19th century, soon after the territory was ceded to the United States by the Creek Indians and the territorial legislature established Troup County. The city was incorporated in December 1828. The area was developed for cotton plantations, and planters migrating from the eastern areas of the South brought along or bought enslaved African Americans in the domestic slave trade to use as laborers.

By 1860 Troup County had become the fourth-wealthiest county in Georgia, based on cotton as a commodity crop. It was the fifth-largest slaveholding county in the state. As the county seat, LaGrange was a center of trade for this prosperous area, and wealthy planters built more than 100 significant homes in the city.

During the American Civil War, LaGrange was defended by a volunteer women&#x27;s auxiliary group known as the Nancy Harts or Nancy Hart Rifles, named after Nancy Hart. After defeating the Confederates in nearby West Point, Georgia, Colonel Oscar H. La Grange led his Union troops to the county seat of LaGrange. He placed Confederate prisoners near the front of the column. The Nancy Harts negotiated a surrender with the colonel.

Although local assets were burned and looted by Union troops, Colonel La Grange spared the private homes of LaGrange, including Bellevue, the home of former US Senator and then Confederate senator Benjamin Harvey Hill, a slave owner. La Grange may have been returning positive treatment which he had earlier received while in captivity. He had been given medical care by Confederates and was attended by a niece of Senator Hill. After recovery, Col. La Grange was exchanged for a Confederate prisoner, and he returned to battle duty.

To show their gratitude for his sparing their homes, one of the Nancy Harts hosted a dinner for Col. La Grange. He paroled some local prisoners so they could attend. Many women of the town cooked all night to provide the meal. The next morning the Federal troops marched out, taking various men of the town as prisoners of war. They were soon released, when it was learned that General Robert E. Lee had surrendered at Appomattox.

===19th century===
In the late 19th century, LaGrange developed as a railroad center and as an industrial center. Textile mills were developed here and elsewhere in the upland region. Initially they employed only white workers. They increased in regional, state and national economic importance into the mid-20th century.

=== 20th century to present ===
Gradually in the late 20th century, much textile manufacturing moved offshore, out of the United States.

The city has transitioned to a mixed economy with some new industries. Interstates 85 and 185 pass through LaGrange, which is a transportation hub in the area. The city has industrial and commercial access, and a Wal-Mart Distribution Center was developed here.

Interface, the world&#x27;s leading manufacturer of carpet tile, was founded in LaGrange in 1973. It has its largest manufacturing center here. LaGrange is also home to a plant for Weiler Forestry.

The city of LaGrange is a full-service utility provider for the region, including electricity, natural gas, water, sewer, refuse collection, and telecommunication. In 2000 the city was named &quot;Intelligent Community of the Year&quot; by the Intelligent Community Forum, joining other cities such as New York, Singapore, Seoul, Glasgow and Toronto. Since 2000 the city has provided free Internet service to every household. It also has been ranked as a Georgia City of Excellence, and received a Government Technology Leadership Award.

LaGrange was in the news in late January 2017 for the public apology of its police chief and mayor for the city&#x27;s failure in 1940 to protect Austin Callaway, a 16-year-old African-American resident, from being lynched. The police did not report nor investigate his murder very thoroughly.

On November 8, 2021, it was announced that Upstate New York-based firearms manufacturer, Remington Arms, would be moving their global headquarters from Ilion, New York to La Grange, and would be hiring 865 people over the span of five years. Construction is expected to cost $100 million.

The southern half of the city was heavily damaged by an EF2 tornado on January 12, 2023. The tornado injured four people along its path as well.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 30,858 people, 11,246 households, and 6,862 families residing in the city.

==Government==
LaGrange is governed by a mayor and six-person city council. The mayor is elected citywide (at-large). Three council members are elected to one post each from each of two council districts, designated as 1a, 1b, and 1c from the first district, with similar naming for posts in the second district. Candidates must declare for a post in one of the districts at the time of their filing, and must win a majority to be elected. This system was established for the first municipal election in 2011. (This was in compliance with a consent decree and court order settling litigation since 1982 under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.)

Previously a smaller number of city council members were elected at-large; as each candidate had to command a majority of electors, the minority seldom could elect a candidate of their choice. The Department of Justice recorded objections to the city of LaGrange changes to election methods in October 1993 and December 1994. The 1993 objection related to the use of two at-large seats in a mixed city council plan with four single-member districts; the 1994 objection related to the use of one at-large seat in a mixed city council plan with two &quot;super-districts&quot; and four single-member districts.
From 1997, more city council seats were established in LaGrange. Municipal elections are held in odd-numbered years.

The current mayor of LaGrange is Jim Arrington. He was elected mayor on May 21, 2024, filling a seat vacated by the death of former mayor Willie T Edmondson, who was the first African-American elected Mayor of LaGrange. The mayor and all council members are elected for four-year terms on a nonpartisan basis. The city council hires a full-time city manager, who oversees daily operations of city departments.

In January 2017, Police Chief Louis M. Dekmar apologized publicly for his department&#x27;s failure in 1940 to protect a 16-year-old black youth, who was lynched.

==Peanut Statue==
In 1975, the Peanut Statue was constructed in Ashburn and was then considered an official state monument in 1998. In the year 2018 it was destroyed by Hurricane Michael. The newer peanut statue appears smaller than the original peanut statue, although the exact measurements are unknown. The woods that the original peanut was next to was cleared out, and the small picnic table as seen in the first image was presumably destroyed by Hurricane Michael, the same hurricane that destroyed the original peanut statue.

The small tower constructed of brick was reused for the newer peanut statue, as was the crown. The original peanut statue was made of fiberglass. The brick tower is 15 feet tall and has a crown attached to it.

<text>Blairsville is a city and the county seat of Union County, on the northern border of Georgia, United States. It was founded near the Nottely River, which was dammed in 1942 as part of the Tennessee Valley Authority project, forming Lake Nottely. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 616.

==History==
During the 1830s, the United States conducted Indian Removal of the Cherokee Nation and other Southeast tribes, to what was designated as Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. This area along the Nottely River was part of the large Cherokee territory and the leader Goingsnake was born here in 1758.

After American settlers moved into this area, in 1835 the Georgia General Assembly designated Blairsville as the Union County seat. The town is named after American Revolutionary War veteran James Blair.

The neighboring city of Dahlonega was known as the first site of gold in the United States, but the Blairsville area was known to have the purest gold in the mountains of northern Georgia. Assayers in Washington, D.C. could tell by looking that gold ore was from the Coosa Mines because it was “the yellowest gold” submitted and its brilliant color set it apart.

This area of northern Georgia was still rural and isolated before World War II. During the Great Depression, under the President Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, the Nottely River was selected as part of the Tennessee Valley Authority projects. The river was dammed in order to form a reservoir to generate hydroelectric power. It also created a lake with recreational opportunities. This was one of the projects that produced electrification in a rural area.

Blairsville&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;North Georgia News&quot;, was first published in 1909. United Community Banks, Inc., one of the largest financial institutions in the Southeast U.S., was founded in Blairsville in 1949.

==Geography==

U.S. 76 and GA-515 run through the city together, leading northeast to Young Harris and west to Blue Ridge. Atlanta is to the south via U.S. 19.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
Blairsville has a humid subtropical climate, yet due to its elevation of , typically records far lower temperatures at night than what is encountered in much of the Southeastern U.S., and has slightly higher precipitation totals ( annually) than most locations in the state; the average diurnal temperature variation exceeds in each of the spring and autumn months. Snow usually occurs several times every year. The average annual snowfall is 4 inches. The monthly daily mean temperature ranges from in January to in July. There are 7.6 days of highs and 4.6 days where the high fails to rise above freezing annually.

<text>Chickamauga is a city in Walker County, Georgia, United States. The population was 2,917 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Chattanooga, TN–GA Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Before the 1800s, the Chickamauga Cherokee settled around Chickamauga Creek, where they farmed and hunted the lands. They stayed there until their forced exodus during the Trail of Tears (1838). In the early to mid-19th century, the present town of Chickamauga was a large plantation in the rolling hills of northern Georgia. When the Cherokee Nation was divided into districts and courts in 1820, Crawfish Springs was made the capital of the new Chickamauga District. After the Cherokee removal, the first court in Walker County was held there in the former Cherokee courthouse. The local post office was Crawfish Springs.

During the War of 1812, 500 Cherokee warriors from the area fought alongside General Andrew Jackson at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, against the Creek Indians, who were aligned with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The battle ended in a victory for the U.S. Army.

The Lee and Gordon families greatly influenced Chickamauga&#x27;s post-Cherokee history. In 1836 Gwinnett County native James Gordon established a plantation at Crawfish Springs and built a grist mill two miles east of town, on Chickamauga Creek. Lee and Gordon&#x27;s Mill, which contained the area&#x27;s first general store, was situated near a blacksmith shop and stagecoach stop. From 1840 to 1847, Gordon built his Doric-columned brick house (known today as the Gordon-Lee Mansion), which overlooks Crawfish Springs.

The area was settled by many other farm families and life was busy and fruitful in the fertile valleys, until even this remote part of the South was visited by the sounds of cannon and guns during the American Civil War. The Battle of Chickamauga, named for nearby Chickamauga Creek, was fought on September 19–20, 1863. It involved more than 150,000 soldiers from the Union and Confederate armies. Before the battle, Union Gen. William Rosecrans put his headquarters at the Gordon Lee Mansion. During the battle, wounded and injured soldiers were cared for in the home and nearby buildings. Many Union doctors remained behind to care for their patients after the Southern victory. Parched soldiers of both sides drank from the town&#x27;s namesake springs.

Crawfish Springs was the site of an 1889 reunion of veteran soldiers, Northern and Southern, who had fought in the Battle of Chickamauga. Called the &quot;Blue and Gray Barbecue&quot;, hundreds of soldiers and their families visited the sites of the bloody battle over 25 years before, smoking the pipe of peace, healing the wounds, and helping start the Chickamauga National Park. The Chickamauga Battlefield, established in 1890, is just north of the City of Chickamauga, and is a part of the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park, the first and largest in the country.

In 1888, a railroad line was built through Crawfish Springs. A syndicate bought the land and used some of it to develop a summer resort, complete with the Park Hotel, which opened in 1891. Around this same time, the Central of Georgia Railway built a stone depot for visitors to the hotel (both the tracks and depot remain today). After passenger service ceased in the 1950s, the city schools, library system, and recreation department used the depot. It now houses the Walker County Regional Heritage and Model Train Museum. Occasional tourist train excursions stop at the Chickamauga depot. The Durham Iron and Coal Company built coke ovens on Chickamauga&#x27;s north side, used to transform coal into coke for iron and steel foundries in Chattanooga. Beginning in 1891, coal was transported by train twice daily from Lookout Mountain to Chickamauga. Production peaked in 1904, at about 700 to 1,000 tons of coal per day, and ended entirely during the Great Depression. These coke ovens were restored in the 1990s for exhibition.

In the early 20th century, Chickamauga became a textile-mill town. New England native Daniel Ashley Jewell, who had moved to middle Georgia prior to the Civil War, built a cotton mill. The small community in central Georgia that grew up around his mill is still called Jewell. His sister subsequently married a Colonel W.L.L. Bowen. Jewell and his brother-in-law reorganized the bag company and it became the Bowen-Jewell Bag Company. Soon after, Colonel Bowen&#x27;s nephew, A. S. Bowen, joined the company as a salesman.

The company&#x27;s best customers were the large grain mills in east Tennessee. For this reason, it was determined to move the company to Chattanooga in 1905. D.A. Jewell and business partner Colonel Bowen bought land in Chickamauga in 1907 from US Senator Gordon Lee. The men had heard that Lee, the owner of the springs, was proud of his sharp business dealings and had sold Crystal Spring several times, only to repossess it as soon as the first payment was missed. Jewell and Bowen dressed themselves in their worst clothes and tried to look like a less than affluent rural men. They approached Lee and discussed buying the land. When a price had been quoted, they told Lee to have his attorney draw up the papers and they would return to work out the terms of purchase. When they came back, they were wearing their normal clothes and had their attorney with them. Rather than seeking terms, they paid in cash, and Lee had no choice but to relinquish the property.

Jewell and Bowen also built the Crystal Springs Bleachery Company (in 1909). The Crystal Springs Bleachery Company was a major local employer and a significant player in the development of the town. The mill remained in operation until 2013. Other notable manufacturers have interests in Chickamauga such as Shaw Industries.

Over the last century, the city has changed and grown, from a population of 95 (in 1900) to 3,101 (in the 2010 official Census). The city is surrounded by the north Georgia mountains and valleys, and the history of the area has been rediscovered and restored wherever possible. Today Chickamauga is host to a wide variety of antique, boutique and specialty shops, cafes and restaurants. Within a few blocks of the main shopping district are public parks and historic sites, including Crawfish Springs Park, Coke Oven Park, and Holland-Watson Veterans Memorial Park. From April to September the Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum offers weekend train excursions from Chattanooga to Chickamauga.

When the city was incorporated in 1891, the city&#x27;s north–south avenues were named for Confederate generals. Today avenues named for Longstreet, Hood, Crittenden, Stewart, and more are clearly marked by large, wood framed signs displaying a description of the General&#x27;s accomplishments, his picture, and flags of the day.

Several major Civil War battle sites and museums are near the city: Chickamauga &amp; Chattanooga National Military Park, Lookout Mountain, Lee &amp; Gordon&#x27;s Mill, McLemore&#x27;s Cove, and the Martin-Davis House, on the site of the Battle of Davis&#x27;s Cross Roads.

==Culture and tourism== 

=== Tourist attractions ===
Chickamauga offers a variety of tourist attractions.

Lee and Gordon&#x27;s Mills, one of the oldest mills in the state of Georgia, is located about two miles east of the center of town on the west bank of the Chickamauga Creek.

The Walker County Regional Heritage and Model Train Museum is housed in the stone train depot building. The museum exhibits Civil War collectibles, Indian artifacts and Cherokee arrowheads, World War I artifacts, antique guns and furniture and a complete working display of Lionel Old Gauge model trains that date back to 1947.

The Chickamauga coke ovens are located just north of downtown Chickamauga on Highway 341. The beehive ovens of the Durham Iron and Coal Company were designed to turn coal into coke for use in the iron and steel foundries in nearby Chattanooga, Tennessee.

The Gordon Lee Mansion was originally the Gordon residence built by James Gordon, who began construction in 1840 and completed in 1847. The mansion and surrounding buildings are now used as a bed and breakfast as well as a restaurant and banquet center.

Crawfish Spring, the main water supply for the early settlements, and later for the city of Chickamauga in the early to mid-20th century, is located on Cove Road just south of the main town and across the road from the Gordon Lee Mansion. The spring is no longer used as a water supply and has been converted into a park setting with picnic tables, a swing, and a gazebo.

The Holland-Watson Veterans&#x27; Park was dedicated on May 27, 2002. It is named after two Chickamauga soldiers, Sgt. Eddie H. Holland and Cpl. Thomas A. &quot;Tommy&quot; Watson, who lost their lives during Vietnam. A Huey helicopter is mounted on a pedestal in the center of the walking track as a symbol of the war and those who fought and died for their country.

<text>Jersey is a town in Walton County, Georgia, United States. The population was 146 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Prior to, and until around 1904, this community was originally known as Centerville since it was almost equidistant from the surrounding towns of: Monroe, Social Circle, Covington, and Loganville. But, when the town decided to establish a US Post Office of its own, rather than have to travel to the county seat, or... to collect mail, a problem arose. Federal Postal Regulations (logically) prohibited two towns in the same State having the same name. This prompted an extended and hot debate in the community that lasted most of the winter. At the time, this area was primarily agricultural and was very well known for its high quality in dairy farming and production of high quality milk.. Only a couple of months prior to this event, Old Man H. D. Ambercrombie (a quite prominent businessman, and early settler in that area) had just taken possession of his newly imported—at great expense—full blooded, Jersey Bull from the European Isle of Jersey, acquired to improve the quality of his herd and to increase their milk production. After much debate, the town applied for and was awarded a name change to &quot;Jersey&quot;. They were thus able to establish their own unique Postal Address and establish a US Post Office of their own.

The Georgia General Assembly incorporated Jersey as a town in 1905.

==Geography==

Jersey is located at (33.716872, -83.803943).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 163 people, 61 households, and 45 families residing in the town. By 2020, its population was 146.

==Education==
Up until the early 1960s, the town of Jersey had its own School and virtually all of the teachers were also local area residents who knew each one of the children, and their entire families. Many attend the same Local Churches, some had their own children as their Students. Some Teachers were Graduates of Jersey&#x27;s School, and some taught multiple generations of students from the same families.. In 1962, due to a reduction in local school age population and a movement to consolidate local schools, the local school was closed down and students (mostly) transferred to Social Circle Public Schools. There were limited (other) options at that time. A few teachers followed, but most simply Retired from teaching.

The town is now officially considered part of the Walton County School District., although a (small?) percentage do attend Higher Rated Private Schools in the area.

==History==

Established by British settlers in Creek territory in the 18th century, shortly after the American Revolution, the town of Sandersville became the county seat of Washington County in 1796. Creek leaders had not yet ceded their territory when Sandersville was settled. According to a book on Georgia place names, the city was named after M. Saunders, a local store owner. The settlement was located at an intersection of Native American Indian trails, and later the site of Saunders&#x27; general store.

The town appears on Anthony Finley&#x27;s 1827 map of Georgia.

In 1864, during the Civil War, General William T. Sherman skirmished and then paused in Sandersville during his March to the Sea. Brief resistance to the advancing Union forces was centered on the courthouse. As they left, Sherman&#x27;s troops burned both it and the jail, but left the rest of the town intact. A new Washington County Courthouse was built in 1869.

The Sandersville Railroad was built in 1893 as a part of the Central of Georgia Railway, but still operates today as a privately owned shortline that connects to Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Georgia Division Savannah District at Tennille, Georgia, 4 miles to the south.

<text>Helen is a city in White County, Georgia, United States, located along the Chattahoochee River. The population was 531 at the 2020 census. The city has now been made over, as a tourist attraction, to look like an old-world Bavarian village. This idea was suggested by John Kollock, an Atlanta artist.

==History==
===20th-century===
Helen was laid out by John E. Mitchell of St. Louis during the years 1912 and 1913. When a name for the small settlement was being sought, a lumber official suggested the name of his daughter and there was little opposition. Called the &quot;Star of the North,&quot; Helen was incorporated on August 18, 1913. Helen was built along the former route of the Unicoi Turnpike, a 1,000-year-old Native American trail connecting Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia.

Formerly a logging town in decline, Helen resurrected itself by becoming a replica of a Bavarian alpine town, in the Appalachians instead of the Alps. This design is mandated through zoning first adopted in 1969, so that the classic southern German style is present on every building, even on the small number of national franchisees present. In 1975, Documerica photographer Al Stephenson documented the life, recreation, and economy of the Helen area before and during the reconstruction of the settlement.

===21st-century===

Tourism is a key economic activity in Helen, catering mostly to weekend visitors from the Atlanta area and also motorcyclists who enjoy riding the roads in Helen and its surrounding areas. Helen can be crowded in late October, when autumn leaves typically peak. It also hosts its own Oktoberfest during September, October and November. Events and festivals are held throughout the year, including the &quot;Southern Worthersee&quot;, which is a stateside Volkswagen and Audi event that pays tribute to the Worthersee Tour in Austria. An annual hot-air balloon race is also held here on the first weekend in June.

The main road through town is north–south Georgia 75. The Helen stream gauge (HDCG1) is located on its bridge over the Chattahoochee in the middle of downtown. A parallel route to the west is labeled Georgia 75 Alt to identify it as a bypass route around the town and its traffic jams in the autumn and on some weekends.

Unicoi State Park and Lodge, spanning , is located immediately northeast of Helen on Georgia 356. The park encompasses Unicoi Lake, a freshwater lake, offering outdoor activities for all seasons. Among these are a swimming beach, trout streams, wheelchair-accessible fishing docks, seasonal canoe, kayak and paddle boat rentals, seven picnic shelters with charcoal grills, three playgrounds for children, spots for birding, of hiking within the park (with adjacent trails in the Chattahoochee National Forest), of mountain biking trails within the park, and a number of places to enjoy the natural environment of the lake and park. Unicoi State Park also offers lodging in several forms. Access to Anna Ruby Falls, part of the Chattahoochee National Forest, is through the park.

Hardman Farm State Historic Site is located near Helen.

<text>Cohutta () is a town in Whitfield County, Georgia, United States. It is part of the Dalton Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 764 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The architecture of the small city gives the impression that it once displayed a vibrant downtown; this is perhaps due to the once-booming railroad system that still rumbles through Cohutta. Cohutta reflects the trajectory of many smaller towns in the United States. The town emerged as a stop on the railroad from Cleveland, Tennessee, to Dalton, Georgia, and served as a transportation and commercial center for the surrounding farming areas. According to local lore, the town was originally known as &quot;Shakerag,&quot; from the rag would-be passengers would wave to stop trains passing through.

In the 1920s, the town had a bank and a hotel, as well a high school, and was frequented especially in summer by inhabitants of Chattanooga seeking cooler temperatures. The high school burned down in 1952 and was not rebuilt.

As recently as the late 1960s, Cohutta had a small supermarket, three smaller &quot;sundry&quot; stores, a feed and seed, and a hair salon. The improvement of roads and the ease of access to larger cities (in this case, Dalton) drew shoppers away, so that by the 1990s, Cohutta had no large businesses at all with the exception of a downtown hardware store, a general store near the main road leading downtown from SR-71, and two convenience stores located at each end of town on the state highway route. Over the last decade, the surrounding area has become something of a bedroom community for Dalton, with housing developments taking over many of the farms in the area. Regardless, Cohutta maintained all town services during this time as required by the charter to include town police, fire, and sanitation services to incorporated properties.

Town services are still fully maintained in 2022 with two town clerks, a staffed public works department, municipal court staff with judge and solicitor, an environmental court, and a full-service town police department which is available 24-7-365. In 2021-2022 the town has approximately 20+ employees in various roles and positions.

==Geography==
Cohutta is located at (34.959202, -84.952908).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (1.59%) is water. Cohutta also has 4.2 miles of state highway (SR-71 also known as Cleveland Highway), from the Tennessee state line to Bank of Dalton Drive in their jurisdiction, per Georgia state databases.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2010, there were 661 people, 275 households, and 170 families residing in the town. The population density was . The racial makeup of the town was 95.76% White, 2.27% African American, 0.30% Native American, 0.61% Asian, 0.61% from other races, and 0.45% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.97% of the population.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 23.0% under the age of 18, 63.7% between the ages of 18 and 64, and 13.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 89.1 males.

In 2000, the median income for a household in the town was $41,563, and the median income for a family was $44,444. Males had a median income of $30,592 versus $22,232 for females. The per capita income for the town was $17,510. About 8.2% of families and 6.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 8.1% of those under age 18 and 3.4% of those age 65 or over.

==Culture==

Cohutta prides itself on the Red Clay State Historic Park that serves as a national Native American meeting ground, Cherokee memorial with a museum, and outdoor park and recreation center for visitors. This part of the state is rich in Cherokee history as well as classic southern heritage.

The city is home to the Cohutta Fish Hatchery, formerly a part of the U.S. Game and Fish Department and is now operated by the University of Georgia. The hatchery has a small visitors&#x27; center and aquarium, open to the public.

Since 2019, the Town of Cohutta has begun a revitalization of the historic downtown district to include family-owned small businesses and restaurants that have been successful even through the COVID-19 pandemic. The Town of Cohutta community growth before and during COVID-19 has remained positive. Cohutta also prides itself with many annual events to include the hallmark Town of Cohutta Independence Day Celebration that sees upwards of 5000+ visitors to the town due to the event. Other annual community events include a street dance, Ruritan Club Chicken-Q and Christmas parade with annual caroling on the historic downtown Martin&#x27;s Corner. Information regarding the Town of Cohutta, administration, community events, and much more may be located on the town&#x27;s website, which is updated regularly per town administration.

The Creative Arts Guild is the oldest multi-disciplinary community arts center in the state of Georgia. Founded in 1963 by a group of civic leaders, the Creative Arts Guild began as a grass-roots community movement originally housed in the Old Firehouse on Pentz Street in historic Downtown Dalton. The Guild began offering art, music, dance and theatre classes as well as gallery shows and exhibitions. As programming and class attendance grew, plans for a larger facility were developed. In 1981, the Guild moved to its permanent home at 520 West Waugh Street. The vision of that small group of patrons has grown into an organization that now houses four educational departments (visual art, dance, gymnastics, and music) as well as the Arts in Education outreach programs, events, gallery exhibits, music and dance concerts and recitals and acts as a hub of culture for North West Georgia and South East Tennessee.

==History==
=== Pre-history ===
Woodland Indians and Creek Nation initially held the area of present-day Dalton, Georgia. The first recorded white man in the area was Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto (1540). By the mid-18th century, when the Cherokee forced the Creek Nation out of their homelands, to the west and south, the Cherokee Indians called the mountains of north Georgia their &quot;Enchanted Land&quot; until their own forced removal in 1838.

=== Industrialization ===
By the time the last Cherokees were removed from the land, work was underway for a railroad, the Western and Atlantic Railroad (W&amp;A), to join the Tennessee River with the Georgia Railroad then under construction. In 1847, Dalton was defined as a mile radius from the city center, the Western and Atlantic Depot. The final segment of this pivotal railway was completed in Tunnel Hill, Whitfield County in 1850. A second railroad, East Tennessee and Georgia, was completed in 1852.

Catherine Evans Whitener&#x27;s revitalization of the pre-Civil War-era craft of candlewicking gave rise to a cottage chenille bedspread industry. Homes along U.S. Highway 41 displayed brightly patterned homemade bedspreads on front yard clotheslines in hopes of luring tourists into a purchase. The stretch of highway passing through Whitfield County became known colloquially as &quot;Peacock Alley&quot; in reference to one of the most common patterns depicted on the bedspreads. The bedspread business boomed to a multimillion-dollar industry by the 1950s, and from this early origin, the carpet tufting industry grew in Dalton after Glenn Looper developed an adaptation that allowed the mechanism used to tuft yarn into muslin or cotton for bedspreads to tuft into jute, shifting the nation&#x27;s carpet manufacturers from woven wool products in the northeast to tufted synthetic carpets in northwest Georgia. Today, carpet mills remain the region&#x27;s major employers and economic drivers.

Dalton was named for Edward Dalton White.

===Civil War===

During the Civil War, the city of Dalton saw its first action during the Great Locomotive Chase, on April 12, 1862. More than a year later, on September 18–20, 1863, massive Union and Confederate forces battled a few miles west of Dalton at the Battle of Chickamauga, and later during the Chattanooga campaign. The war came to Whitfield County at the First Battle of Dalton, a series of skirmishes between February 22 and February 27, 1864, during which Union Major General George H. Thomas probed Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston&#x27;s Army of Tennessee to determine if the loss of two full divisions to reinforce Confederate forces elsewhere had made the Army of Tennessee vulnerable to Union attack. Johnston&#x27;s forces held and Thomas withdrew to Chattanooga. At the beginning of the Atlanta campaign, the Battle of Rocky Face Ridge and Dug Gap began on May 7, 1864, and ended when Johnston completed the withdrawal of his forces from Dalton on May 12. The Second Battle of Dalton occurred during the Atlanta campaign on August 14–15, 1864.

In John Bell Hood&#x27;s Tennessee campaign, soldiers of Major General Samuel G. French&#x27;s Division of Lieutenant General Alexander Stewart&#x27;s Corps of the Confederate Army of Tennessee attacked a Union blockhouse in Tilton before passing through Dalton and heading west.

The U.S. government recently declared Dalton and Whitfield County to have more intact Civil War artifacts than any other place in the country. Also of interest is the site of the historic Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad Station; one of the few still standing and restored to its original architectural state, this site used to be the location of the Dalton Depot Restaurant (closed since 2015). The steel center marker for the original surveying of the city of Dalton is still inside the depot.

=== Modern history ===
The A. D. Strickland Store was once a rural county store, built c. 1878, and is now part of the National Register of Historic Places.

The Bohannon Gang was arrested in Dalton on the 27th of August, 1897. The gang of &quot;car thieves&quot; were believed to have been robbing area cargo trains for about a decade before their capture, and were accused of over $100,000 in cargo theft, now over $3.7 million today. Led by Hiram Walter Bohannon, the gang&#x27;s trial was quickly followed by the &quot;merchant&#x27;s trials&quot; in which many Dalton area businessmen were accused and convicted of receiving stolen goods. The trial was widely publicized and even appeared in the October 24th, 1897 New York Times. The ring leaders were sentenced to the Cole City Convict Camp, in Cole City, Georgia. The last to be released was Hiram Walter Bohannon, in 1903, after receiving a pardon from Joseph M. Terrell.

==Carpet industry==
Dalton is often referred to as the &quot;Carpet Capital of the World,&quot; home to over 150 carpet plants. The industry employs more than 30,000 people in the Whitfield County area. More than 90% of the functional carpet produced in the world today is made within a radius of the city.

The agglomeration of the carpet industry in Dalton can be traced back to a wedding gift given in 1895 by a teenage girl, Catherine Evans Whitener, to her brother, Henry Alexander Evans, and his bride, Elizabeth Cramer. The gift was an unusual tufted bedspread. Copying a quilt pattern, she sewed thick cotton yarns with a running stitch into unbleached muslin, clipped the ends of the yarn so they would fluff out, and finally, washed the spread in hot water to hold the yarns by shrinking the fabric. Interest grew in young Catherine&#x27;s bedspreads, and in 1900, she made the first sale of a spread for $2.50. Demand for the spreads became so great that by the 1930s, local women had &quot;haulers,&quot; who would take the stamped sheeting and yarns to front porch workers. Often entire families worked to hand-tuft the spreads for 10 to 25 cents per spread. Nearly 10,000 area cottage &quot;tufters,&quot; men, women, and children were involved in the industry. Income generated by the bedspreads was instrumental in helping many area families survive the Depression. Chenille bedspreads became popular all over the country and provided a new name for Dalton: the Bedspread Capital of the World.

When a form of mechanized carpet making was developed after World War II, Dalton became the center of the new industry because specialized tufting skills were required and the city had a ready pool of workers with those skills.

By the 1970s manufacturers had begun to develop techniques to move from plain tufted carpet to sculpted carpet. Improved patterning, stain and wear resistance, and colors have made the modern tufted carpet the choice for functional carpet for the vast majority of homes and moved woven carpet to a decorative role.

By the 1990s carpet scraps had made up 60% of the area&#x27;s waste, and a balefill site called the Carpet Landfill was created to accommodate the unique issue. It currently stores over 500,000 tons of baled carpet.

From June 2011 to June 2012 as carpet mills that had employed thousands restructured, downsized, cut back productivity and closed, Dalton lost 4,600 jobs—according to the U.S. Labor Department—making it the city with the worst job loss in the United States.

The city&#x27;s unemployment rate has since dipped to as low as 5.5%.

== The solar industry ==

Dalton is poised for a remarkable transformation as it emerges as a leader in the solar industry. This shift began in 2019 when Hanwha Qcells, one of the world&#x27;s largest solar panel manufacturers, opened a massive factory in Dalton, employing 750 people to produce an impressive 1.7 GW of solar panels. This facility stands as the largest solar manufacturing site in the Western Hemisphere.

The initial investment significantly boosted local employment, and subsequent expansion plans by Qcells have promised even more growth. On October 18, 2023, Qcells completed expansions that added an additional 2 GW of solar capacity, increasing the factory&#x27;s total output to over 5.1 GW and creating 510 new jobs in solar manufacturing.

Today, Qcells’ Dalton factory operates as a powerhouse, producing nearly 30,000 solar panels daily and solidifying its position as the fourth-largest manufacturer in Dalton, trailing only three established flooring giants.

This growth has been supported by Sen. Jon Ossoff&#x27;s Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, which was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on November 19, 2021. This legislation provides tax credits to American manufacturers across the entire solar supply chain, from polysilicon production to fully assembled solar modules. By encouraging local manufacturing in the solar sector, the act aims to strengthen Georgia&#x27;s renewable energy infrastructure, reduce dependence on imports, create local jobs, and contribute to broader green economy goals in the United States.

The shift towards solar energy presents Dalton with an opportunity to diversify its economy, potentially cultivating a new generation of Daltonians employed in the clean energy sector.

==Environmental problems==
Dalton&#x27;s carpet production has taken up to one-third of the Conasauga River summer water flow. The river and city water supply has been contaminated with perfluorinated compounds used to make carpets stain-resistant. Dalton Utilities&#x27; has processed wastewater using a land application system, that spread effluent on more than nine thousand forested acres in an area called Looper&#x27;s Bend. Runoff was found to drip down into the river.

==Education==
===Public schools===
The Dalton City School District, which covers the entire city of Dalton, holds pre-school to grade twelve, and consists of six elementary schools, a middle school, and two high schools. The district has 366 full-time teachers and over 5,739 students.
The Whitfield County School District serves areas outside of the Dalton city limits, even if they have &quot;Dalton, GA&quot; postal addresses. Coahulla Creek High School, Phoenix High School, and Southeast Whitfield High School have Dalton postal addresses but lie outside of the city limits and serve areas not in the city limits.

==Infrastructure==
===Air===
Dalton Municipal Airport, a general aviation airport, lacking scheduled commercial flights, is southeast of the city. International airports are in Chattanooga to the north and Atlanta to the south.

===Rail===
The Southern Railway had two Cincinnati to Florida named trains, &quot;Ponce de Leon&quot; (Cincinnati to Florida via Lexington, Chattanooga and Atlanta) and &quot;Royal Palm&quot; (Cincinnati to Florida via Lexington, Chattanooga and Atlanta) that made stops in the town into the 1960s. The Louisville and Nashville Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Dixie Flagler&quot; (Chicago and St. Louis to Florida), &quot;Dixie Flyer&quot; (Chicago and St. Louis to Florida) and &quot;Georgian&quot; (Chicago and St. Louis to Atlanta) also made stops in Dalton. The last train was an unnamed L&amp;N Evansville, Indiana - Atlanta, Georgia remnant of the &quot;Georgian,&quot; ending service on April 30, 1971.

===Roads===
Interstate 75 runs a short distance west of the city. The modern U.S. Route 41 and U.S. Route 76 circumvent Dalton, but historically they ran through the city. Georgia State Route 52 runs through the city&#x27;s downtown.

<text>Tunnel Hill is a city in northwest Whitfield County and southern Catoosa County, Georgia, United States. It is part of the Dalton Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 963 at the 2020 census. The city is named for the Chetoogeta Mountain Tunnel, a railroad tunnel built in the late 1840s.

==History==
The community was first known as Doe Run. It was incorporated on March 4, 1848, as Tunnelsville, and changed its name in 1856 to Tunnel Hill.

Cooper on behalf of the state-owned Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad.

The Georgia General Assembly incorporated Tunnel Hill as a town in 1856.

Throughout the American Civil War, the homes around Tunnel Hill were used as part of a major hospital system. The Clisby Austin House also served as the headquarters for Union Gen. William T. Sherman while he made his plans for attacks against nearby Dalton and Resaca, which became the opening battles of what would later be known as the Atlanta Campaign. The area hosted many engagements and camps throughout the course of the war. These are remembered through an annual Battle Reenactment held in September.

The dates of the actual military engagements were September 11, 1863; February 23, 24-25 1864; May 5–7, 1864; and March 3, 1865.

<text>Washington is the county seat of Wilkes County, Georgia, United States. Under its original name, Heard&#x27;s Fort, it was for a brief time during the American Revolutionary War the Georgia state capital. It is noteworthy as the place where the Confederacy voted to dissolve itself, effectively ending the American Civil War.

The population was 4,134 as of the 2010 census. The city is often referred to as Washington-Wilkes, to distinguish it from other places named Washington.

==History==
Heard&#x27;s Fort was established in 1774 by colonist Stephen Heard. The settlement served as the temporary capital of the new state of Georgia from February 3, 1780, until early 1781.

===American Revolutionary War===
The Battle of Kettle Creek, one of the most important battles of the American Revolutionary War to be fought in Georgia, was fought on February 14, 1779, in Wilkes County, about eleven miles (17.7 km) from present-day Washington. The American Patriots were victorious, taking 75 prisoners and killing roughly 70 Loyalists, while losing 32 of their own men.

===American Civil War===
As a child, Alexander H. Stephens had studied at the school in Washington presided over by Presbyterian minister Alexander Hamilton Webster. He later became a politician and was elected as Vice-President of the Confederacy.

No major battles of the Civil War were fought in or near Washington, but the city is notable as the site where Confederate President Jefferson Davis held his last meeting with his cabinet. On April 3, 1865, with Union troops under General Ulysses S. Grant poised to capture the capital at Richmond, Virginia, Davis escaped for Danville, together with the Confederate cabinet.

After leaving Danville, and continuing south, Davis met with his Cabinet for the last time on May 5, 1865, in Washington, along with a hand-picked escort led by Given Campbell, including his personal body guard, Sgt. Joseph A Higgenbotham, Jr., of Amherst/Nelson County, Virginia. The meeting took place at the Heard house (now used as the Georgia Branch Bank Building), with fourteen officials present.

===Historic sites===
Several historic sites in Washington are on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Wilkes County Courthouse, the Robert Toombs House State Historic Site, the Washington-Wilkes Historical Museum, the Mary Willis Public Library, Cherry Grove Baptist Church Schoolhouse, and the recently restored historic Fitzpatrick Hotel, built in 1898.

==Geography==
Washington is located at (33.735394, −82.741420).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.25%) is water.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 3,754 people, 1,646 households, and 904 families residing in the city.

==Education==

*Washington-Wilkes Primary School
*Washington-Wilkes Middle School
*Washington-Wilkes Comprehensive High School

Michelle Smith is the Superintendent of Schools.

==In popular culture==
One of Washington&#x27;s most lingering mysteries is that of the lost Confederate gold. As the last recorded location of the remaining Confederate gold, the Washington area is thought to be the site where it is buried. Worth roughly $100,000 when it disappeared in 1865, at 2016 prices its value would be around $3.6 million. The cable television channel A&amp;E produced a documentary focusing on this legend.

In April 2012, Bumgardner and Bill Lucado, who also owned property, announced they were seeking a buyer for the properties by advertising &quot;Toomsboro for sale&quot; although the existing community of Toomsboro maintains its own identity. They suggested a movie production company might be interested in using Toomsboro as a film set. In September 2018, 36 pieces of property over went up for sale for an asking price of $1.7 million, with an eye toward a preservation-minded buyer &quot;who appreciates its history&quot;. In the aftermath of the murder of Ahmaud Arbery in 2020, 19 families cooperatively bought of land in Toomsboro to establish a Black community &quot;where all Black people feel safe without fear of being murdered for who they are&quot;. The Freedom Georgia Initiative promotes the new community as Freedom, Georgia.

<doc id="110452" wikidata="Q1987749" url="?curid=110452" title="Poulan, Georgia">
<text>Poulan is a city in Worth County, Georgia, United States. The population was 780 in 2020. Poulan is part of the Albany, Georgia metropolitan area.

Poulan is notable for its police department&#x27;s speed trap tactics from 2006 to 2012. In 2009, Poulan&#x27;s small police force generated nearly $900,000 from fines and fees, a number comparable to a city 30 times its size and due to the charges and fees being more than most cities. The per capita revenue from fines and fees is $1,019.15.

==History==
The Georgia General Assembly incorporated Poulan as a town in 1889. The city was named for Judge W. A. Poulan. The remnants of what was once a bank and pharmacy are still standing on Broad Street. Poulan is also home to the only two historical registered properties in Worth County; the Poulan Library and Possum Poke. Poulan was settled in 1877 along the Brunswick and Albany railroad.

==Speed trap==
The Poulan Police Department has been featured in numerous articles by investigative journalists, most notably for its speed trap tactics since 2009. The city attorney; former Albany, Georgia mayor Tommy Coleman has repeatedly defended the enforcement tactics, as well as the Poulan and Warwick Police Departments.

Between 2008 and 2012, Poulan is estimated to have received $1,676,402.80 (a per-capita amount of $2,012.49) from their Police Department&#x27;s tactics inside the Poulan city limits on U.S. Route 82 (GA State Route 520). Residents of Poulan have publicly voiced their concern over their police department&#x27;s tactics multiple times with department leadership specifically denying quotas for summons and citations for traffic related offenses.

In August 2014, a local resident of Poulan placed a sign that warned drivers traveling on U.S. Route 82 (GA State Route 520) of the speed trap tactics. A local NBC/ABC affiliate, WALB, featured a story on the resident who claimed that Poulan Police Officers were given specific quotas. Poulan Police Chief Larry Whisenant, explicitly refuted this claim and denied that any officers were given quotas for speeding citations. In February 2015 the sign was stolen from its placement along U.S. Route 82 (GA State Route 520).

In December 2023, local NBC/ABC affiliate WALB produced a report about the Poulan Police Department and showcased the speed trap tactics that the Police Department continues to use. The report calculated that the Poulan Police Department produced more income than the cost of the agency to the city&#x27;s budget. Poulan Police commanders were specifically asked for documents showing the amount of income received from speeding related citations. According to the article, Poulan &quot;declined to comment&quot;. According to Georgia law, a county or municipal law enforcement agency&#x27;s budget may not exceed 35% of its annual budget from speeding related fines.

In July 2024, local NBC/ABC affiliate WALB produced another report on both the Poulan and Warwick Police Departments. City attorney Tommy Coleman defended the City of Poulan and the Police Department in an interview, claiming that Poulan&#x27;s budget percentage from speed enforcement was at 22% for the years 2023 to 2024. Worth County Sheriff Don Whitaker also defended the City of Poulan in an interview he participated in for the report. Disturbingly, Worth County officials (including a member of the County Commission) and City of Poulan officials, admitted that Poulan required the revenue from speed related citations because their tax base was so small.

== Controversy ==
In December 2007, then Police Chief Angie Schlosser, was fired from the Poulan Police Department after the city claimed she had performed an illegal background investigation into a city council member. While Schlosser denied the allegations, she stated that there were concerns about the background and supposed criminal past of the council member. Despite the seriousness of the allegation, Schlosser was never charged with a crime, and no outside investigation was conducted.

In September 2012, then Poulan Mayor, Dustin Grubbs, was arrested in Dougherty County and charged with felony possession of various narcotic prescription pills including oxycodone, oxycontin, and two different mixtures of Vicodin in different dosages with a total prescription pill count of 57. The arrest showcased the continued synthetic opioid epidemic in the United States. Despite the charges, Grubbs remained the Mayor of Poulan until his death in October 2020.

In August 2017, Rosemary Jones, a police officer employed by Poulan Police, was arrested and charged by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (along with her husband) with two counts of felony cruelty to children in the first degree, two counts of aggravated assault, and one count of felony false imprisonment. Their arrest made national and international news. Despite the arrest, Jones was retained by the Poulan Police Department, and eventually promoted to captain.

== COVID-19 ==
During the COVID-19 epidemic, Worth County Sheriff Don Whitaker deputized members of the Poulan Police Department so that county ordinances specifically related to COVID-19 regulations could be enforced by Poulan Police Officers inside the city limits of Poulan, GA.

==Geography==

Poulan is located at (31.513739, -83.791041). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.7 square miles (4.3 km), all land.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 946 people, 365 households, and 273 families residing in the city. By 2020, its population declined to 760.

Halaula is within the Bond District, a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places.

The nucleus of this rambling New England dwelling was built in 1840 by the Rev. Isaac Bliss who was assisted by a carpenter from Honolulu. First occupied in January 1841, it was of &quot;native wood and plaster on stone foundation with a good cellar.&quot;

Assigned to the Kohala Station in June 1841, Rev. and Mrs. Elias Bond moved into the thatched mission house. Mr. Bond described the first addition in 1842: &quot;Our dwelling house is 40 feet long by 36 feet wide. The study and native room are 21 feet by 24 feet.&quot;

Through the years the home was expanded and modified to accommodate several generations who lived under its roof. Lived in until 1930, it is now kept as a family retreat with all its old furnishings. Surrounded by the original outbuildings, the Bond House remains the last mission complex still intact in Hawaii.

<text>Hawaiian Ocean View (usually referred to as &quot;Ocean View&quot;) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Hawaii County, Hawaii, United States located in the District of Kaū. It includes the subdivisions of Hawaiian Ocean View Estates (HOVE), Hawaiian Ocean View Ranchos, Kahuku Country Gardens, Kula Kai View Estates, Kona Gardens, Keone&#x27;s Ranchos, and Kona View Estates. The population was 4,437 at the 2010 census, up from 2,178 at the 2000 census.

==History==
The HOVE development consisted of 10,697 lots north of the Hawaii Belt Road in the western part of the District of Kaū. The terrain varies from rugged lava fields to ohia trees and other vegetation. Elevation ranges from about up to the level. Initial sales began in the late 1950s. The original developer of HOVE was the Crawford Oil Company. Later, other subdivisions were put in place downslope of HOVE and the Hawaii Belt Road. In the early 1980s a service station and a hardware store were built.

In 1989 the Ocean View Town Center was developed, and the Ocean View Road Maintenance Corporation began an extensive rebuilding program of the roads. Shortly thereafter the Ocean View Development Corporation started a new market which included a laundromat and restaurant. Ocean View now has two shopping centers.

In January 2004, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park purchased the nearby property previously known as Kahuku Ranch.

Ocean View has a post office with the ZIP code of 96737. The USPS does not provide street delivery of mail except on Mamalahoa Highway. It is, therefore, difficult to get confirmation of a Street address for mail order companies to send purchases.

==Geography==
Ocean View is located at the southern end of the island of Hawaii at (19.107649, -155.767186), on the southwest rift zone of the shield volcano Mauna Loa. Its elevation ranges from above sea level along the southern edge of the CDP, to along the northern edge.

Hawaii Route 11 passes through the community, leading northeast to Hilo and northwest to Kailua-Kona.

The area is prone to earthquakes.

===Climate===
The Hawaiian Ocean View climate borders between a Tropical Savanna Climate (Köppen &quot;As&quot;) and a Hot Semi-arid Climate (Köppen BSh). The average temperature in January is almost cool enough to qualify this climate as a warm-winter form of a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csb&quot;) or a uniform rainfall Subtropical highland climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;).

<text>Hilo () is the largest settlement in and the county seat of Hawaii County, Hawaiʻi, United States, which encompasses the Island of Hawaiʻi, and is a census-designated place (CDP). The population was 44,186 according to the 2020 census. It is the fourth-largest settlement in the state of Hawaiʻi, the largest settlement in the state outside of Oahu, and the largest settlement in the state outside of the Greater Honolulu Area.

Hilo is in the District of South Hilo. The city overlooks Hilo Bay and has views of two shield volcanoes, Mauna Loa, an active volcano, and Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano. The Hilo bayfront has been destroyed by tsunamis twice. The majority of human settlement in Hilo stretches from Hilo Bay to Waiākea-Uka, on the flanks of the volcanoes.

Hilo is home to the University of Hawaii at Hilo, ʻImiloa Astronomy Center, as well as the Merrie Monarch Festival, a week-long celebration, including three nights of competition, of ancient and modern hula that takes place annually after Easter. Hilo is also home to the Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corporation, one of the world&#x27;s leading producers of macadamia nuts. Hilo is served by Hilo International Airport.

==History==
Around 1100 AD, the first Hilo inhabitants arrived, bringing with them Polynesian knowledge and traditions. Although archaeological evidence is scant, oral history has many references to people living in Hilo, along the Wailuku and Wailoa rivers during the time of ancient Hawaiʻi. Oral history gives the meaning of &quot;Hilo&quot; as &quot;to twist&quot;.

Originally, the name &quot;Hilo&quot; applied to a district encompassing much of the east coast of the island of Hawaii, now divided into the District of South Hilo and the District of North Hilo. When William Ellis visited in 1823, the main settlement there was Waiākea on the south shore of Hilo Bay. Missionaries came to the district in the early-to-middle 19th century, founding Haili Church.

Hilo expanded as sugar plantations in the surrounding area created jobs and drew in many workers from Asia. For example, by 1887, 26,000 Chinese workers worked in Hawai&#x27;i&#x27;s sugar cane plantations, one of which was the Hilo Sugar Mill. At that time, the Hilo Sugar Mill produced 3,500 tons of sugar annually.


A breakwater across Hilo Bay was begun in the first decade of the 20th century and completed in 1929. On April 1, 1946, an 8.6-magnitude earthquake near the Aleutian Islands created a tsunami that hit Hilo 4.9 hours later, killing 159 total in the islands, with 96 deaths in Hilo alone. In response, an early warning system, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, was established in 1949 to track these killer waves and provide warning. This tsunami also caused the end of the Hawaii Consolidated Railway, and instead the Hawaiʻi Belt Road was built north of Hilo using some of the old railbed.

On May 22, 1960, another tsunami, caused by a 9.5-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Chile that day, claimed 61 lives, allegedly due to the failure of people to heed warning sirens. Low-lying bayfront areas of the city on Waiākea peninsula and along Hilo Bay, previously populated, were rededicated as parks and memorials.

Hilo expanded inland beginning in the 1960s. The downtown found a new role in the 1980s as the city&#x27;s cultural center with several galleries and museums opening; the Palace Theater reopened in 1998 as an arthouse cinema.

Closure of the sugar plantations (including those in Hāmākua) during the 1990s hurt the local economy, coinciding with a general statewide slump. Hilo in recent years has seen commercial and population growth.

==Geography==
Hilo is on the eastern and windward side of the island. It is classified by the U.S. Census Bureau as a census-designated place (CDP), and has a total area of , of which is land and of which (8.4%) is water.

=== Climate ===
Hilo has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen: &quot;Af&quot;), with substantial rainfall throughout the year. Its location on the windward coast (relative to the trade winds), makes it the fourth-wettest city in the United States, behind the southeast Alaskan cities of Whittier, Ketchikan and Yakutat, and one of the wettest in the world.

The wettest year was 1994 with , and the driest was 1983, with . The most rainfall in one month was in December 1954. The most rainfall in 24 hours was on November 2, 2000.

Hilo&#x27;s location on the shore of the funnel-shaped Hilo Bay also makes it vulnerable to tsunamis.

A main source of tourism in Hilo is the annual week-long Merrie Monarch Festival, the world&#x27;s preeminent hula competition and festival, which brings in visitors and participants from all over the world. It is held in the spring of each year beginning on Easter Sunday.

The local orchid society hosts the largest and most comprehensive orchid show in the state, the annual Hilo Orchid Show, which has been presented since 1951 and draws visitors and entrants worldwide.

Hilo is home to Hawaii&#x27;s only tsunami museum, mostly dedicated to the 1946 Pacific tsunami, and is notable for the banyan trees planted by Babe Ruth, Amelia Earhart and other celebrities. It is home to the Panaʻewa Rainforest Zoo, shopping centers, cafés and other eateries, movie theaters, hotels, restaurants, and a developed downtown area with a Farmers Market. Downtown Hilo is bounded approximately by the Wailuku River, Kamehameha Avenue, Ponahawai Street, and Kapiolani Street.

===Corporations and science===
The Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corporation is in Hilo, south of the main town off Hawaiʻi Belt Road, north of Keaau.

Hilo is home to most of the astronomical observatories on Mauna Kea as well as the ʻImiloa Planetarium and Museum. Astronomy has an economic impact of $100 million annually on the island. Astronomy on Mauna Kea was developed at the invitation of the Hawaiʻi Chamber of Commerce following the collapse of the sugarcane industry.

== History ==
Honokaa&#x27;s economy was based primarily on the sugar production of the Hāmākua Sugar Company from 1873 to 1994. With the closing of the Honokaa sugar production and the most recent staggered tourism, the local economy has been in decline. It has become increasingly a bedroom community for Hilo. As the gateway to the Hāmākua Coast, Honokaa provides the first unobstructed view of the Pacific Ocean traveling downslope from Waimea.

The Hāmākua Coast was the classic plantation community in the early 20th century, but since the closing of the Big Island&#x27;s sugar industry, the district has had to diversify its economy. Presently, with much of the district still zoned for agriculture, Hāmākua has seen rising prospects in other crops including pineapples, coffee, papaya, macadamia nuts, and tea.

== People ==
Honokaa is the home of the fourth governor of Hawaii since statehood, John D. Waihee III, who served from December 2, 1986, to December 2, 1994. Waihee is the first Native Hawaiian to hold that office anywhere in the United States.

Honokaa was also home to Yoshito Takamine, the late Hawaii state representative and labor leader.

Roseanne Barr, an American actress, comedian, writer, producer and politician, resides in Honokaa.
== Culture ==

Honokaa boasts a historic downtown district. In 1930, the Honokaa People&#x27;s Theatre was built on Māmane Street by the Tanimoto family. The theater hosted the Hāmākua Music Festival every fall from 1993 to 2006, and again in 2009. Proceeds went to fund local music education on the island. The festival has hosted a number of jazz, classical, and Hawaiian folk musicians, including Ray Brown, Gene Harris, James Moody, Howard Alden, Big Brother and the Holding Company and Hubert Laws.

Ranching, along with nascent diversified agriculture, is the primary industry in Honokaa and the Hamakua District. Honokaa hosts a Saturday farmers&#x27; market, held on Māmane Street, The Farmers&#x27; Market at Hāmākua Harvest on Sundays from 9:00am – 2:00pm on the corner of Māmane Street and Māmalahoa Highway, and the Honoka&#x27;a Country Market features Hawaii Big Island Beef, a locally raised and grass-fed beef.

While ranching and rodeos may seem idiosyncratic to some visitors, ranching in Hawaii has a long history. This tradition has been celebrated annually on Western Weekend beginning in 2006, and included children&#x27;s activities, country western bands, a block party with paniolo barbecue, a rodeo, and the ribald Saloon Girl Contest. Western Weekend was sponsored in part by a grant from the County of Hawaii Department of Research &amp; Development, Hawaii Tourism Authority.

== Cinema ==
Honokaʻa is the namesake and setting in the 2009 Japanese film &quot;Honokaʻa Boy&quot; (Japanese: ホノカアボーイ). The world premier occurred in the Honokaʻa People&#x27;s Theatre, which was featured prominently in the film.

There is reference to a marketplace in the town in the film &quot;Cloud Atlas.&quot;

== School ==
Honokaa High &amp; Intermediate School is located in the CDP. Honokaʻa Elementary School shares some campus facilities such as the cafeteria and library.

<doc id="110474" wikidata="Q627970" url="?curid=110474" title="Kailua-Kona, Hawaii">
<text>Kailua-Kona is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Hawaii County, Hawaii, United States. It is most commonly referred to simply as Kona (a name it shares with the district to which it belongs), but also as Kona Town, and occasionally as Kailua (a name it shares with a community on the windward side of Oahu), thus its less frequent use. Kailua-Kona is the second-largest settlement on the island of Hawaii (after Hilo) and the largest on the island&#x27;s west side, where it is the center of commerce and the tourist industry. Kailua-Kona is served by Kona International Airport, just to the north in the adjacent CDP of Kalaoa. The population was 19,713 at the 2020 census, up from 11,975 at the 2010 census.

Kailua-Kona was the closest major settlement to the epicenter of the 2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake.

Kailua-Kona&#x27;s boundaries were altered significantly for the 2020 census. The eastern portion of Kailua-Kona became part of the neighboring Holualoa CDP, while the western portion of Holualoa became part of Kailua-Kona.

== History ==
The community was established by King Kamehameha I to be his seat of government when he was chief of Kona before he consolidated rule of the archipelago in 1795. It was later designated as the capital of the newly unified Kingdom of Hawaii. The capital was later moved to Lāhainā, and then to Honolulu.

Royal fishponds at Kaloko-Honokōhau National Historical Park were the hub of unified Hawaiian culture. The town later functioned as a retreat of the Hawaiian royal family. Up until the late 1800s, Kailua-Kona was primarily a small fishing village. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the region has undergone a real estate and construction boom fueled by tourism and investment.

== Attractions and events ==

Kailua-Kona is the host of the annual Ironman World Championship triathlon, the annual Kona Coffee Festival, and the Hawaiian International Billfish Tournament.

Kona coffee is the variety of &quot;Coffea arabica&quot; cultivated on the slopes of Hualālai and Mauna Loa in the North and South Kona Districts. The Kona Historical Society manages two coffee related historical sites: the Kona Coffee Living History Farm and the H.N. Greenwell Store Museum just south of Kailua-Kona.

Ali&#x27;i Drive, Kailua&#x27;s oceanfront downtown street, starts at Kailua-Kona Pier. It has also been given the designation as a Hawaii Scenic Byway called the &quot;Royal Footsteps Along the Kona Coast&quot;. This byway features archaeological sites that have survived for hundreds of years.

North of the pier is the Kamakahonu royal residence and Ahuena Heiau, and nearby now stands the King Kamehameha&#x27;s Kona Beach Hotel. Another royal residence is Hulihee Palace, used by members of the Hawaiian royal family until 1914. The Historic Kona Inn and other shops are on the street.

Churches on the drive include Mokuaikaua Church, Hawaii&#x27;s first Christian church (the congregation began in 1820), Saint Michael the Archangel Catholic Church, and Living Stones Church, a historical structure built after Mokuaikaua and used as a Christian Missionary landing location in the 1800–1900. Parks include La&#x27;aloa Bay (also known as Magic Sands or White Sands Beach) and Kahaluu Bay, a popular snorkeling location.

Boat tours that allow tourists to watch dolphins and whales, swim with manta rays, turtles and fish in the ocean usually depart from the Kailua-Kona pier or nearby Honokohau and Keauhou harbors.

<text>Pahala is a census-designated place (CDP) in Hawaii County, Hawaii, United States. The population was 1,403 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Pahala was created by a sugarcane plantation. The area selected to house the sugar refinery had several key features: 
* a flat plateau on a sloping mountainous region
* direct access to a water well
* a strategic central location to sugarcane fields
In Hawaiian, &quot;Pāhala&quot; refers to the ashes of leaves from the hala tree (&quot;Pandanus tectorius&quot;). Long ago, when cracks were found in the sugarcane fields, workers would stuff them with hala leaves and burn them.

For years, Pahala consisted of a manager&#x27;s house, several plantation homes, a general store, and the sugar refinery. Many of the sugarcane workers were housed in small camps in and around Pahala and in camps situated throughout the outlying sugarcane fields. Many of these camps were self-sufficient. They consisted of eight to twelve plantation dwellings with a small store. Some camps had specialty shops such as a blacksmith or a simple barbershop. As time passed some installed gas stations.

In 1881, the first public school in the district of Kau was established in Kapapala. The humble campus consisted of just two buildings. Some years later the school and its two buildings were relocated to Pahala and called Pahala High and Elementary School. In 1959, as Hawaii Territory became the state of Hawaii, the last class of the Pahala High School held commencement ceremonies. The school then became Kaū High and Pahala Elementary School. It is the second oldest public school in the state of Hawaii, behind Lāhaināluna School in Lāhainā. Still in use today at Kaū High is Kapono Building, the oldest public school building west of the Rocky Mountains. The only other public school in the district of Kaū is Nāālehu Elementary. Nāālehu once had a high school. Today, students attend grades kindergarten through 6th grade in Nāālehu.

As time progressed, Pahala became the focal town of the northeastern side of the district of Kaū; Nāālehu became the other focal town to the south of the district. Businesses from outer camps migrated to Pahala to set up shop. With social and economic changes came the demands for convenience. Soon, more stores opened up. A bank and gas stations were built. For leisure, a town hall or &quot;Club House&quot; was built and used by the plantation and the community to hold meetings and parties. In the early 1940s Pahala Theatre was built.

By the early 1960s, C. Brewer &amp; Co. had decided to phase out all of the camps and move homes and other structures to Pahala. At this time C. Brewer explored other alternatives to diversify into, eventually settling on macadamia nuts. Considered a weed in their native Australia, macadamia trees flourished into a new niche market for Hawaii.

The early 1970s demonstrated how influential the world&#x27;s economy can be to Pahala. The 1970s brought about fuel shortages, and developing nations began to produce cheaper sugar. During the 1970s C. Brewer proposed the perfect opportunity to diversify. A gentleman by the name of Bob Shleser had proposed to Doc Buyers (then CEO of C. Brewer) the idea and technology to convert the Pahala Sugar Mill to produce ethanol fuel from sugarcane. Shleser also proposed that Hawaii County pass a bill that would require 25% of all vehicles on the island to be retrofitted to use ethanol by 1985. Doc Buyers, however, decided against it.
By the late 1970s, with sugar&#x27;s looming demise, C. Brewer instead decided to expand its macadamia nut operations. They began to phase out sugarcane fields that encircled Pahala, converting them to grow macadamia trees.

By the mid 1980s it was apparent that sugar had seen its heyday. Honuapo&#x27;s mill had closed in 1972 and its workers transferred to Pahala. But other sugarcane plantations around the island began to close as well. Still, the Pahala Sugar Mill continued to produce record tons per acre, but at a steep price. At the time it cost $1.50 to produce , which would then sell for $0.60. Congress had proposed bills that placed huge tariffs and taxes on imported sugar. But economically, even those measures could not stave off the inevitable.

In the 1990s, it was all too evident that sugarcane had lost its lustre. C. Brewers&#x27; investors were getting older and demanded Doc Buyers cut their losses and liquidate. In 1994, Buyers made a last-ditch effort to keep the mill running. But it required all workers to take drastic pay cuts; most would have had to accept minimum wage. The workers refused. That sealed the fate of the sugar legacy in Pahala. The last sugarcane was hauled and processed at the mill. Over the next two years the mill was dismantled and sold as parts to other manufacturing plants around the world. The sugarcane plantation and mill shut down in April 1996.

Many who lived and worked in Pahala moved on to other jobs around the island. Some took jobs in the hotel industry. Some commute up to five hours a day to and from jobs at resorts along the Kohala coast. Some moved to Maui and Kauai and worked at sugarcane plantations there. Others moved to the mainland to try a fresh start. Many old timers that have generations of family ties to Pahala had passed on. Many in the younger generation have chosen not to return.

Still, there are those that have found their roots and figured out a way to remain in Pahala. In fact, unlike many other places where the larger plantation homes were purchased by outsiders coming to live in Hawaii, the manager homes in Pahala were mostly purchased by local people who have stepped up to the new economy and have such jobs as doctor, bakery manager, fisherman, policeman, painting contractor and other jobs important to the community. Some new people have also moved in, restored the historic homes and established their roots, and now call Pahala home.

There has also been a movement to preserve the shoreline near Pahala, called the Kaū Coast, which is the longest uninhabited coast in Hawaii. Its now include of oceanfront park, for which the community raised more than $4 million to purchase and set aside forever. Another along the coast called Kawa is likely to be preserved. Inland, more than have been added to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which now circles Pahala in the mountains above the village.

==Geography==
Pahala is located in the southern part of the island of Hawaii at . Hawaii Route 11 forms the southeast border of the community. The highway leads northeast to Hilo and southwest to Nāālehu. The main entrance to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is to the northeast of Pahala on Route 11.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land.

==Climate==
Pahala has a dry-summer tropical savanna climate (As) with hot daytime temperatures and mild nighttime temperatures year round and a summer dry season. Precipitation peaks during the month of November.

On April 27, 1931, the temperature reached 100 °F (37.8 °C) in Pahala, which is the highest temperature recorded in Hawaii.
==Economy==

Pahala&#x27;s main industries include one of the world&#x27;s largest macadamia nut growing orchards, cattle and horse ranching, small independent Kaū Coffee farms, and the Kaū Coffee Mill &amp; Visitor Center. Kaū Coffee has won many international coffee tasting competitions.

A former sugar plantation town, Pahala is the district hub for education and health services, including a pharmacy, hospital, clinic, preschool and public school as well as a library.

Plantation houses, from small cottages to large homes and the former plantation manager&#x27;s manor, have been restored around the village, serving local families and visitors to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and Punaluu Black Sand Beach. The village has a post office, swimming pool, two food stores, fire station and gas station. Fisherman sell their catch and farmers sell their produce on the roadside in the village. There is a Catholic, an Assembly of God, and a Baptist church, as well as a Buddhist Hoangwanji and a Tibetan Buddhist temple up the mountain in Wood Valley.

The Kaū District&#x27;s regional newspaper – the &quot;Kaū Calendar&quot; – with offices in Pahala, is online daily and printed monthly.

Pahala hosts the annual Kaū Coffee Festival and Kaū Coffee Trail Run, Science Camps of America for teenagers each summer, and many family reunions and weddings, as well as NGO, company, music and dance retreats.

<text>Pāhoa () is a census-designated place (CDP) in the District of Puna in Hawai‘i County, Hawai‘i, United States. The population was 924 at the 2020 census. The population dropped by 1.8% from 945 in the 2010 census.

==History==
===2014 lava flow===

In June 2014, a lava flow dubbed the June 27th flow started running from a vent in the Puu Ōō cone in a northeast direction towards the villages of Ka&#x27;ohe Homesteads and Pāhoa.

In early September it appeared that the lava flow was en route to the small community of Ka&#x27;ohe Homesteads. Community leaders and state officials began to draw up plans for evacuations and the mayor signed an emergency proclamation as the flow approached to within 0.8 miles, a distance it was expected to cover in approximately a week. On September 13, a release from the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory stated that the flow had begun to shift away from the subdivision as it had interacted with both the cracks and down-dropped blocks within the East Rift Zone of Kīlauea volcano and a natural valley that leveled away from Ka&#x27;ohe Homesteads.

The lava flow then advanced on Pāhoa. On October 25, the flow had reached the town&#x27;s recycling facility, which was closed and temporarily relocated as a result. The flow was quickly advancing on a nearby cemetery and triggered the first series of evacuations. On November 10, the flow claimed one home.

Officials feared that the lava would cover Hawaii Route 130, the only route in and out of Pāhoa and of the entire lower Puna section of the island. On October 22, The National Park Service announced that it would help state and county officials create an emergency route along 8 miles of the buried Chain of Craters Road in order to help Puna residents who would potentially lose access to the rest of Hawaii. Construction of the Chain of Craters alternate route began by making a path over a wall of lava rock covering the road in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The eruption eventually stopped short of Route 130, and work on the emergency route was called off in November 2014.

===2018 eruption===
The 2018 lower Puna eruption which featured destructive lava flows resulting in the loss of approximately 700 homes, originated in nearby Leilani Estates.

==Geography and environment==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land. Soils underlying the Pāhoa area are volcanic in origin, deriving from the currently active Kīlauea Volcano (Earth Metrics Inc., 1986). Kīlauea is one of the Earth&#x27;s most active volcanoes, with the January 2006 eruption being the longest rift zone eruption in Kīlauea&#x27;s 200-year recorded history (Volcanology, 2007). The volcanic soils underlying Pāhoa are considered to have been generated by lava flows within the last 125 to 500 years. For example, the eruption of 1840 is known to have deposited a lava flow within of Pāhoa. Both Hawaii Route 130 and Hawaii Route 132 enter the town boundaries.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2010, there were 945 people in 321 households residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 356 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 14.92% White, 0.42% African American, 1.48% American Indian &amp; Alaska Native, 43.49% Asian, 12.59% Native Hawaiian &amp; Pacific Islander, 0.95% from other races, and 26.14% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 6.56% of the population.

There were 321 households, out of which 24.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them. The average household size was 2.94.

The age distribution was 22.3% under the age of 18, 7.3% from 18 to 24, 12.0% from 25 to 34, 18.1% from 35 to 49, 23.0% from 50 to 64, and 17.4% who were 65 years of age or older. For every 100 females, there were 105.0 males. For every 100 males age 18 over there were 95.2 females.

The median income for a household in the CDP at the 2000 census was $33,333, and the median income for a family in 2000 was $43,571. Males had a median income of $26,103 in 2000 versus $23,571 for females. The per capita income for the CDP in 2000 was $13,850. About 15.7% of families and 18.0% of the population were below the poverty line in 2000, including 28.9% of those under age 18 and 5.2% of those age 65 or over.

==Culture ==
In the Hawaiian language, the word means dagger or knife. The held pointing downwards, such as the statue at Pāhoa High and Intermediate School, is a symbol of peace and strength. It is unknown when indigenous Hawaiians settled the area during pre-contact times, but the deep, rich soil and important protected archeological sites in the area suggest a long history of habitation. Legends associated with the Pāhoa area are referenced in Hawaii&#x27;s ancient oral history in the Pele and Hiiaka Myth.

== Education ==
There are two primary schools in the Pāhoa area, Pāhoa Elementary School and Keonepoko Elementary School, in the Hawaiian Beaches subdivision. There are two secondary schools, Pāhoa High and Intermediate School on Pāhoa Village Road and the Hawaii Academy of Arts and Sciences.

<text>Waimea is a landlocked community in Hawaii County, Hawaii, United States. Waimea is the center for ranching activities and &quot;paniolo&quot; culture. The name Waimea means &quot;reddish water.&quot; For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined that community as a census-designated place (CDP). The population was 7,028 at the 2000 census and 9,212 at the 2010 census. Since each U.S. state cannot have more than one post office of the same name, and there is a post office in Waimea, Kauai County, the official U.S. Post Office designation for Waimea is Kamuela, although this name is only used by the post office, not by locals or the local government.

The Parker Ranch in and around Waimea is the largest privately owned cattle ranch in the United States, and the annual Fourth of July rodeo is a major event. The Waimea Cherry Blossom Heritage Festival is held annually in the first week of February.

Waimea is home to the headquarters of two astronomical observatories located on Mauna Kea, the W. M. Keck Observatory and the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope. It is headquarters of the International Lunar Observatory Association.

Waimea is the home of Hawaii Preparatory Academy and Parker School, two of the top independent schools in Hawaii.

==History==

===Native Hawaiian===
It is believed that the watershed area of the Kohala mountains once supported several thousand native Hawaiians, who practiced subsistence agriculture, made kapa, and thatched dwellings. As the Europeans arrived in the area, most of the sandalwood (&quot;Santalum ellipticum&quot;) forests were harvested and the land became ideal for grazing animals. California longhorn cattle were given as a gift to Hawaiian King Kamehameha I by British Captain George Vancouver in 1793. In 1809, John Palmer Parker arrived to the area after jumping ship and over time became employed by the king to hunt and tame the population of cattle, which at this point had grown out of control. In 1815 Parker married Kipikane, the daughter of a high-ranking chief, and as a family developed what is now Parker Ranch, the largest ranch in the area.

===Spanish===
The early 19th century also saw the arrival from the Viceroyalties of New Spain and Río de la Plata of the horse and Spanish &quot;vaqueros&quot; (&quot;cowboys&quot;), bringing the traditional Euro-Latin culture of riding and roping skills. The king hired these &quot;vaqueros&quot; to teach Hawaiians herding and ranching skills, and by 1836 the island had working cowboys. As the Hawaiian culture and Latin &quot;vaquero&quot; cultured commingled, a unique breed of cowboy emerged, the &quot;paniolo&quot;.

===World War II===
During World War II, beef and vegetable prices increased, and farmers returned to cultivate corn, beets, cabbage and a variety of other green vegetables. Farm and ranchland acreage increased from 75 in 1939 to 518 in 1946. Waimea saw many soldiers during this time, who were stationed at Camp Tarawa. When the war was over and the military had left, Waimea had an entertainment center, the Kahilu Theatre, and an airstrip, Waimea-Kohala Airport.

==Geography==
Waimea is located in the northern part of the island of Hawaii at an elevation of above sea level. It sits at the southern foot of Kohala, the oldest volcano on the island, and it is near the northwestern base of Mauna Kea, the highest volcano.

Waimea&#x27;s post office name &quot;Kamuela&quot; is the Hawaiian name for &quot;Samuel&quot;, after Samuel Parker (1853–1920), the grandson of John Parker.

Hawaii Route 19 passes through the community, leading southeast to Hilo and southwest to Kailua-Kona via a route close to the shore. Hawaii Route 190 leads south from Waimea and provides a shorter inland route to Kailua-Kona of .

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Waimea CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.10%, are water.

===Climate===
Waimea displays a warm summer Mediterranean Climate (Köppen climate classification Csb). The town sits at the transition between the wet and dry sides of the Big Island, and its weather therefore often changes dramatically over less than a mile.

<text>ʻAiea (; , ) is a census-designated place (CDP) located in the City and County of Honolulu, Hawaii, United States. As of the 2010 Census, the CDP had a total population of 9,338.

== Geography ==

Kamehameha Highway (Hawaii Route 99) divides most of ʻAiea from the shore of Pearl Harbor (mostly US government property), and the parallel major thoroughfare, Interstate H-1, further cuts the town&#x27;s commercial district into two distinct areas. These east–west routes (and other streets, such as Moanalua Road) connect ʻAiea to Pearl City, immediately adjacent on the west, and Halawa, adjacent on the east. The residential area known as ʻAiea Heights extends up the ridgeline above the town. The communities of Newtown Estates and Royal Summit are located at the western edge of ʻAiea near its border with Pearl City at Kaahumanu Street. Residents of the census-designated places (CDP) of Waimalu and Hālawa use ʻAiea in their postal address.
== Climate ==


== History ==
&quot;Aiea&quot; was originally the name of an &quot;ahupuaa&quot;, or Hawaiian land division. The name was derived from a species of plant in the nightshade family, &quot;Nothocestrum latifolium&quot;. It stretched from Aiea Bay (part of Pearl Harbor) into the mountains to the north.

At the end of the 19th century, a sugarcane plantation commonly known as ʻAiea Sugar Mill was opened in the district by the Honolulu Sugar Company.

In July 1941, five months before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Commander Thomas C Latimore from , vanished while walking in the hills above ʻAiea. Despite several major searches and a naval investigation, his disappearance has never been explained. Within the U.S. Navy, many believed he might have been abducted and killed by a local Hawaiian Japanese spy ring because he had either stumbled upon their activities in the hills or had been specifically targeted because of his background in Naval Intelligence.

On December 7, 1941, a large part of the Japanese attack focused on the military installations around the town and the ships moored off shore. For example, one damaged ship, , beached in ʻAiea Bay to prevent sinking. Many people photographed the attack from the hills in ʻAiea. Part of Naval Base Hawaii was built in ʻAiea, including the Aiea Naval Hospital and the Nimitz Bowl.

After World War II the plantation shut down and the mill was converted into a sugar refinery. Meanwhile, developers started extending the town into the surrounding former sugarcane fields. In the years since then, ʻAiea has grown into an important suburb of Honolulu. The town&#x27;s sugar history came to a close in 1996, when C&amp;H Sugar closed the refinery. Then in 1998, the 99-year-old sugar mill was torn down by the owners, amid protests from town residents and the County government.

<text>Kalaeloa () is a census-designated place (CDP) in Honolulu County, Hawaii, United States. The population was 2,364 at the 2020 census. The community occupies the location of the former Naval Air Station Barbers Point, which was closed in 1999 and subsequently transferred to the State of Hawaii. The geographical name, &quot;Ka lae loa&quot;, means &quot;long point&quot; in Hawaiian and is the native name for what has been called Barbers Point on Oahu. The area was known as Barbers Point because Captain Henry Barber wrecked his ship on a coral shoal at this location on October 31, 1796.

In 1993, after the federal government listed Barbers Point for closure, the state legislature established the Barbers Point Naval Air Station Redevelopment Commission (BPNAS-RC) to guide the redevelopment of the former military facilities comprising John Rodgers airfield and of land along the south shore of Oahu between the towns of Ewa, Kapolei, and Campbell Industrial Park. On July 1, 2002, the Hawaii Community Development Authority became the redevelopment authority for Kalaeloa. The former Naval Air Station runways and associated facilities are now Kalaeloa Airport.

Barbers Point Housing is that part of Kalaeloa retained temporarily by the United States Navy for housing.

==Geography==
Kalaeloa is located at (21.324550, -158.083156).

===Climate===
Tropical savanna climates have monthly mean temperature above 18 °C (64 °F) in every month of the year and typically a pronounced dry season, with the driest month having precipitation less than 60mm (2.36 in) of precipitation.

==Demographics==

As of the 2000 Census, there were 67 people, 16 households, and 16 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 127 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 88.06% White, 5.97% Asian, 2.99% Pacific Islander, and 2.99% from two or more races. 2.99% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 16 households, out of which 87.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 100.0% were married couples living together, and 0.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 4.19 (average family size was also 4.19).

In the CDP the population was spread out, with 50.7% under the age of 18, 1.5% from 18 to 24, 38.8% from 25 to 44, 9.0% from 45 to 64, and none who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 18 years. For every 100 females, there were 91.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 106.3 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $65,625. Males had a median income of $49,531 versus $0 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $21,083. None of the population was below the poverty line.

==History==
In October 1795, during a trading voyage to China, the ship, the &quot;Arthur&quot; arrived in Hawaii led by Captain Henry Barber. He set sail for Kauai after stopping for provisions at Waikiki. After passing the entrance to Pearl Harbor, the &quot;Arthur&quot; wrecked on a reef in high surf and was completely destroyed. Six crew members drowned, but Barber and the other fifteen members of his crew made it ashore in their small boats. The point where the wreck occurred was known thereafter as Barbers Point.

==Nearby facilities and installations==
The immediate vicinity of Kalaeloa, which extends over the southwestern tip of the island of Oahu, includes Coast Guard Air Station Barbers Point, Barbers Point Lighthouse, Kalaeloa Airport, Campbell Industrial Park, including AES Hawaii Power Plant, Hawaii Refinery owned by Par Petroleum Corporation to the southwest and the Barbers Point Harbor. Remnants of the old base remain, such as the streets named after aircraft carriers (i.e. Yorktown, Lexington, etc.), chapels, a post office, and the Navy Exchange which reopened as an indoor go-cart track in January 2011.

In 2017, the state of Hawaii under the Kalaeloa Authority within the Hawaii Community Development Authority (HCDA) rejected a plan to allow SunStrong II LLC to lease 19 acres and build a 5-megawatt photovoltaic solar farm north of the Kalaeloa Heritage Park. Aloha Solar Energy Fund II is leasing 24 acres of HCDA land near the Kalaeloa Airport to build a 5-megawatt photovoltaic solar farm. The United States Navy supplies power to Kalaeloa. SunStrong II&#x27;s project included a 12-kilovolt line extension to Hawaiian Electric Co.&#x27;s (HECO) grid which would have allowed HECO an opportunity to provide power to the Kalaeloa district.

==Education==
Hawaii Department of Education operates Barbers Point Elementary School in Kalaeloa CDP.

== History and etymology ==
The word &quot;ewa&quot; means &quot;stray&quot; in Hawaiian. The name comes from the myth that the gods Kāne and Kanaloa threw a stone to determine the boundaries, but it was lost and later found at Pili o Kahe. Hawaiian settlement on the Ewa Plain dates back at least to the 12th century C.E., at which time kanaka maoli expanded the main channel of Puuloa (Pearl Harbor) before creating fishponds and terraced agricultural fields in the surrounding area. Scholars have recognized Ewa&#x27;s ancient fishponds as exemplary evidence of Native Hawaiian ingenuity.

Before Ewa Beach became a town, it was first a huge plantation farm. With of land sublet by Benjamin Dillingham, W.R. Lowrie became the first plantation manager in 1891, when Hawaiʻi was under the rule of Queen Liliʻuokalani. Ewa Beach is significant for its association with Ewa Sugar Plantation. Throughout the twentieth century, it played a very influential role in Hawaii&#x27;s culture, economy, and politics.

Along much of the South Shore of Oahu, Ewa is a reference to the direction of Ewa Beach, roughly westwards along the shore.

<text>ʻEwa Villages is a census-designated place (CDP) located in the ʻEwa District and the City &amp; County of Honolulu on the leeward side of Oʻahu in Hawaiʻi approximately from downtown Honolulu. As of the 2020 census, the CDP had a population of 7,825.

This area was previously known as Ewa (in Hawaiian, ʻ&quot;ewa&quot; means &quot;crooked&quot;). In the late 19th century to early 20th century, ʻEwa was one of the large population centers on the island of Oʻahu, with industry focused around sugar cane production. The ʻEwa Mill was a major employer that set up residential villages within ʻEwa (from which the modern name arose). Sugar cane is no longer grown on the ʻEwa Plain and ʻEwa is now one of Oʻahu&#x27;s suburban growth centers—an area of substantial sprawl spreading unbroken to ʻEwa Gentry and ʻEwa Beach on the south, Kalaeloa on the southwest, and Kapolei on the west. This area is now referred to as Oʻahu&#x27;s Second City, with a city center (downtown) located in Kapolei.

Honouliuli is a former village and now a place name for the north end of ʻEwa, lying along Honouliuli Stream between ʻEwa Villages and Waipahu.

<doc id="110504" wikidata="Q2611824" url="?curid=110504" title="Halawa, Hawaii">
<text>Halawa () is a census-designated place (CDP) in the ‘Ewa District of Honolulu County, Hawaii, United States. Halawa Stream branches into two valleys: North and South Halawa; North Halawa is the larger stream and fluvial feature. Their confluence is within the H-3/H-201 highways exchange. Most of Halawa Valley is undeveloped. As of the 2020 census, the CDP had a population of 15,016.

Camp H. M. Smith, the headquarters of the United States Indo-Pacific Command, is located here. The Hālawa (Aloha Stadium) Skyline station is located at the base of the valley.

==Cultural history==
The entire ahupuaʻa of Halawa is highly sacred to Kanaka Maoli. At the far Makai (ocean) side at Puʻuloa or Pearl Harbor, it is, according to Kanaka Maoli beliefs, the home of the shark goddess Kaʻahupahau, known as the &quot;Queen of Sharks&quot;, who protected Oʻahu and strictly enforced kind, fair behavior on the part of both sharks and humans. Until the late 1890s, the home of Kaʻahupahau was famously lined with beds of pearl oysters, however, according to Kanaka Maoli religious experts who follow the goddess, Kaʻahupahau removed all of the oysters (and some say, herself) because the area was being abused by human misdeeds. Today, the water of Pearl Harbor has been highly contaminated by nuclear defueling and other toxic influences, and has thereby been designated as a Superfund site.

The upland, or Mauka, portion of Halawa is sacred to Papahānaumoku, the Kanaka Maoli form of Mother Earth, as it is, according to legend, her birthplace and primary home, as well as one of only two or three known remaining Hale o Papa, womenʻs temples where Papa is worshipped. The valley contains many religious and other cultural sites sacred to Kanaka Maoli. Although many sites were destroyed by the invasion of Kahekili II and especially by the building of the highly controversial H-3 Freeway, many remain and are cared for by Kanaka Maoli Aloha ʻAina practitioners to this day.

In the last two decades, North Halawa has been the site of a very public battle over the religious sites and ecological resources destroyed by H-3, which is the most expensive freeway per mile in human history. At least two species were driven to probable extinction (none have been sighted since construction began), many more are declining rapidly, the main aquifer of the area was badly damaged, and religious sites were seriously impacted. Although the freeway was opened in 1997, many are still fighting for mitigation of these impacts, and some are asking for the freewayʻs closure. In 1993, thirteen cultural practitioners were arrested while conducting a ceremony to pray for the healing of the valley. Their lele (religious altar) was destroyed, and the caretakers of the area were barred from entrance to the sites. Today, some of these caretakers, many of them kupuna (elders), have returned to care for the sites, although they now do so through a layer of soot and with the roar of the freeway as a constant sonic backdrop. Many kanaka maoli do not use the freeway because of these impacts, and because of the lasting belief that the road is haunted—an often-attributed explanation for the high accident rate on the freeway (more generally believed to be caused by the high speeds often used by the motorists who traverse it).

There is evidence in the documentary record that upper Halawa was highly significant to Kanaka Maoli. Most of the evidence may be, however, be in the oral record. The Hale O Papa and luakini are mentioned in the massive collection of Bishop Museum reports that took many years to finally be released. However, there was no archaeological evidence that these structures existed by the time of highway construction. The area has been greatly impacted by sugarcane plantations, homesteading, and light industrial use. The site of Waipao Heiau, for example, is currently occupied by a food distribution warehouse.

The Papa temples were associated with the great Ku temples (luakini), which demanded human sacrifice and were usually in areas of greater population and state sponsorship. Without a luakini, there would be no Hale o Papa, according to Samuel Kamakau (see Bishop Museum, H-3 project reports).

&quot;Neighborhoods&quot; of Halawa are very disjointed, in part because of the significant highway exchanges (see below) that now occupy nearly all of the lower end of Halawa Valley between Red Hill and Aloha Stadium. Much of the remainder of the valley along both sides of Interstate H-3 is developed into commercial and light industrial properties. On the east side of H-3 are found the State Animal Quarantine Station and the Halawa High and Medium Security Facility (main O‘ahu prison).

Where the valley widens out closer to Pearl Harbor occur residential neighborhoods: Foster Village adjacent to Āliamanu; and the stadium area between Aloha Stadium and Makalapa. The interfluve (uplands between valleys) on the west comprises Halawa Heights, extending up to Camp H. M. Smith. Along the lower, western edge, Halawa Heights merges with the neighborhoods of ‘Aiea.

The U.S. Postal Code for Halawa Heights is 96701 (the same as for Aiea). The postal code for Foster Village, the stadium area, and Makalapa is 96818 (the same as Āliamanu).
== Geography ==

Halawa is located at (21.377633, -157.922759).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

The route of H-3 extends from its western terminus with east–west Moanalua Freeway (H-201; connecting eastward to Honolulu or westward to H-1 and Aiea) to the 1100-foot (335-m) elevation entrance into the Tetsuo Harano Tunnels, penetrating the Ko‘olau crest. The freeway continues beyond to Kaneohe on windward Oahu.

A significant proportion of H-3 within the valley is carried on the Windward Viaducts; although very expensive to construct, the viaduct is the only way to construct a freeway of this magnitude through such a narrow valley without flooding and destabilization concerns; it is also believed to offer some returns in terms of preservation of both archeological sites and stream ecology.

He also built a railway line from Honolulu to Waialua along the west coast around Kaena Point, which opened the same year and ended in front of his hotel. The railroad inaugurated a passenger train, the Haleiwa Limited, which took two hours for this trip. This railroad was chartered as the Oahu Railway and Land Company. 
Haleiwa was designated a State Historic, Cultural and Scenic District in 1984 by the City and County of Honolulu.

<text>Heeia () is a census-designated place comprising several neighborhoods located in the City &amp; County of Honolulu and the Koʻolaupoko District on the island of Oʻahu north of Kāneʻohe. In Hawaiian the words &quot;heʻe ʻia&quot; mean &quot;washed away&quot;, alluding to a victory achieved by the populace against others from leeward Oʻahu, aided by a tsunami that washed the combatants off the shore.

Heʻeia includes Haʻikū Valley and Heʻeia Kea. The population was 5,001 at the 2020 census. The area is almost entirely one of homes and apartments. Parts of Heʻeia lie along Kāneʻohe Bay, but public access is non-existent owing to private ownership of the property behind the shore.

Notable in the Heʻeia area are:
* Haʻikū Valley, a former United States Coast Guard radio transmitter site with the Haiku Stairs
* Site of the former receiving antenna tower for Station HYPO, the naval cryptanalytic station that did so much toward breaking Japanese naval codes in 1941-1942 that resulted in US victory in the Battle of Midway, seen by most historians as the turning point of the Pacific War. The site of their antenna was He&#x27;eia, not the site of Station HYPO itself. Station HYPO got its name from the phonetic for the letter &quot;H&quot;, because of He&#x27;eia where its antenna was sited
* Heʻeia Fishpond, the largest remaining fishpond on Oʻahu

Heeia Kea is a community and small, undeveloped valley separated from Heʻeia by Heʻeia Marsh and Kealohi Point. Heʻeia Kea Small Boat Harbor, the only public pier and boat ramp on Kāneʻohe Bay, is found here. Several fishponds have been restored in recent years. Although fishponds were developed on most of the islands, the largest concentrations were found in Keʻehi Lagoon, Pearl Harbor, and Kāneʻohe Bay on Oʻahu.

The U.S. ZIP code for Heʻeia and Heʻeia Kea is the same as for Kāneʻohe: 96744.

== Geography ==

<text>Hickam Air Force Base is a United States Air Force (USAF) installation, named in honor of aviation pioneer Lieutenant Colonel Horace Meek Hickam. The installation merged in 2010 with Naval Station Pearl Harbor to become part of the newly formed Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam, on the island of Oʻahu in the State of Hawaiʻi. The base neighbors Daniel K. Inouye International Airport and currently shares runways with the airport for its activities and operations.

==Major units==

Hickam is home to the 15th Wing (15 WG) and 67 partner units including Headquarters of Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), Hawaii Air National Guard and the 154th Wing (154 WG) of the Hawaii Air National Guard. The Air Mobility Command&#x27;s 515th Air Mobility Operations Wing (515 AMOW) provides tactical and strategic airlift within the Pacific region.

In addition, Hickam supports 140 tenant and associate units.

The 15th Wing is composed of four groups each with specific functions. The 15th Operations Group (15 OG) controls all flying and airfield operations. The 15th Maintenance Group (15 MXG) performs aircraft and aircraft ground equipment maintenance. The 15th Mission Support Group (15 MSG) has a wide range of responsibilities but a few of its functions are Security, Civil Engineering, Communications, Personnel Management, Logistics, Services and Contracting support. The 15th Medical Group (15 MDG) provides medical and dental care.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
In 1934, the Army Air Corps saw the need for another airfield in Hawaii when Luke Field on Ford Island became too congested for both air operations and operation of the Hawaiian Air Depot. of land and fishponds adjacent to John Rodgers Airport and Fort Kamehameha were purchased by the War Department from the Bishop, Damon and Queen Emma estates for a new air depot and air base at a cost of $1,095,543.78. It was the largest peacetime military construction project in the United States to that date and continued through 1941.

The Quartermaster Corps was assigned the job of constructing a modern airdrome from tangled algaroba brush and sugar cane fields adjacent to Pearl Harbor. Planning, design, and supervision of construction were all conducted by Capt. Howard B. Nurse of the QMC. The site consisted of ancient, emerged coral reef covered by a thin layer of soil, with the Pearl Harbor entrance channel and naval reservation marking its western and northern boundaries, John Rodgers Airport (HNL today) to the east, and Fort Kamehameha on the south. The new airfield was dedicated on 31 May 1935 and named in honor of Lt Col Horace Meek Hickam, a distinguished aviation pioneer who was killed in an aircraft accident the previous November 5 when his Curtiss A-12 Shrike, &quot;33-250&quot;, hit an obstruction during night landing practice on the unlighted field at Fort Crockett in Galveston, Texas and overturned. Construction was still in progress when the first contingent of 12 men and four aircraft under the command of 1st Lt Robert Warren arrived from Luke Field on September 1, 1937.

Hickam Field was completed and officially activated on September 15, 1938. By November 1939 all Air Corps troops and activities—including most facilities such as the chapel, enlisted housing, and theater, which were dismantled and ferried in sections across the channel—had transferred from Luke Field with the exception of the Hawaiian Air Depot, which required another year to move. In early 1939 construction began on the main barracks, a single three-story nine-winged structure to house 3,200 men at a cost of $1,039,000. Personnel began moving into the barracks in January 1940, and by its completion on 30 September 1940, it was fully occupied and the largest structure of any kind on an American military installation. It included barber shops, a 24-hour medical dispensary, a laundry, a post exchange, multiple squadron dayrooms, and a massive consolidated mess hall at its center, and thus was dubbed the &quot;Hickam Hotel&quot;.

Hickam was the principal army airfield in Hawaii and the only one large enough to accommodate the B-17 Flying Fortress bomber. In connection with defense plans for the Pacific, aircraft were brought to Hawaii throughout 1941 to prepare for potential hostilities. The first mass flight of bombers (21 B-17Ds) from Hamilton Field, California arrived at Hickam on 14 May 1941. By December, the Hawaiian Air Force had been an integrated command for slightly more than one year and consisted of 754 officers and 6,706 enlisted men, with 233 aircraft assigned at its three primary bases: Hickam, Wheeler Field (now Wheeler Army Airfield), and Bellows Field (now Bellows Air Force Station).

=== World War II ===

When the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked Oahu on 7 December 1941, its planes bombed and strafed Hickam to eliminate air opposition and prevent American aircraft from following them back to their aircraft carriers. Hickam suffered extensive damage and aircraft losses, with 189 people killed and 303 wounded. Notable casualties included nine Honolulu Fire Department (HFD) firefighters (three killed, six injured) who fought fires at Hickam during the attack; they later received Purple Hearts for their heroic actions that day in peacetime history, the only civilian firefighters awarded as such to date.

During World War II, the base became a major center for training pilots and assembling aircraft. It also served as the hub of the Pacific aerial network, supporting transient aircraft ferrying troops and supplies to—and evacuating wounded from—the forward areas—a role it would reprise during the Korean and Vietnam wars and earning it the official nickname &quot;America&#x27;s Bridge Across the Pacific&quot;.

=== Cold War ===

After World War II, the Air Force in Hawaii consisted primarily of the Air Transport Command and its successor, the Military Air Transport Service (MATS), until 1 July 1957 when Headquarters Far East Air Forces completed its move from Japan to Hawai‘i and was redesignated the Pacific Air Forces (PACAF). The 15th Air Base Wing, host unit at Hickam AFB, supported the Apollo astronauts in the 1960s and 1970s; Operation Homecoming (return of prisoners of war from Vietnam) in 1973; Operation Babylift / New Life (movement of nearly 94,000 orphans, refugees, and evacuees from Southeast Asia) in 1975; and NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle flights in the 1980s and 1990s. Hickam is home to the 65th Airlift Squadron which transports theater senior military leaders throughout the world in the C-37B and C-40 Clipper aircraft. In mid-2003, the 15th Air Base Wing (15 ABW) was converted to the 15th Airlift Wing (15 AW) as it prepared to bed down and fly the USAF&#x27;s newest transport aircraft, the C-17 Globemaster III. The first Hickam-based C-17 arrived in February 2006, with seven more to follow during the year. The C-17s will be flown by the 535th Airlift Squadron.
On September 16, 1985, the Secretary of the Interior designated Hickam AFB a National Historic Landmark, recognizing its key role in the World War II Pacific campaign. A bronze plaque reflecting Hickam&#x27;s &quot;national significance in commemorating the history of the United States of America&quot; took its place among other memorials surrounding the base flagpole. Dominating the area is a large bronze tablet engraved with the names of those who died as a result of the 1941 attack. Other reminders of the attack can still be seen. Bullet holes mark many buildings in use, including World War II era hangars and the base hospital., including the tattered American flag that flew over the base that morning. It is on display in the lobby of the Pacific Air Forces Headquarters building, whose bullet-scarred walls (the structure was a barracks and mess hall known as &quot;the Big Barracks&quot; in 1941) have been carefully preserved as a reminder to never again be caught unprepared.

===Accidents and incidents===
On 22 March 1955, a United States Navy Douglas R6D-1 Liftmaster on descent to a landing in darkness and heavy rain strayed off course and crashed into Pali Kea Peak in the southern part of Oahu″s Waianae Range, killing all 66 people on board. It remains the worst air disaster in Hawaii″s history and the deadliest heavier-than-air accident in the history of U.S. naval aviation.

==Geography==
Hickam Air Force Base consists of , valued at more than $444 million. It was originally bounded on the north by Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, on the west by the Pearl Harbor entrance channel, on the south by Fort Kamehameha, and on the east by the airport complex. The original main gate is reached via Nimitz Highway (Hawaii Route 92) from Honolulu, and it shares its western terminus with the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard&#x27;s main gate. This part of Nimitz Highway can be reached from the expressway Interstate H-1 (Exit 15) southeast from Halawa or west from Honolulu (Exit 15B) and from Kamehameha Highway (State Hawaii Route 99), the eastern termination of which is at Nimitz Highway.

The housing around the base is within the Hickam Housing CDP.

Hickam AFB is the location of Region 6 of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.

==History==
The name of Iroquois Point was derived from the name USS &quot;Iroquois&quot; which was held by two U.S. Navy ships. Both ships had history that related to that spot at the entrance to Pearl Harbor. USS &quot;Iroquois&quot;, a steam sloop of war commissioned in 1850, was outfitted as a hospital ship to provide care to U.S. sailors aboard vessels anchored in Honolulu Harbor, and it is believed that the ship was anchored near the present Iroquois Point site. The second USS &quot;Iroquois&quot;, a commercial steam tug commissioned in 1898, was assigned to Commander F. Merry as part of his operations at Naval Station Honolulu.

During WWII the Seabees built a Seabee encampment of four 1000 man Construction Battalion areas at Iroquois Point with a chapel. They also built an Advance Base Reshipment Depot (ABRD) and an Advance Base Construction Depot (ABCD). Construction Battalion Maintenance Unit 523 was stationed at the ABRD.

Iroquois Point also had an annex to the Bishop point Section Station and Net Depot across the harbor channel. The annex had a barracks, officer&#x27;s quarters and 600&#x27; of pier.
Starting in the summer of 2003 this U.S. Navy property was leased to Hunt Building Co. and Fluor Federal Services LLC—a joint venture now operating as Ford Island Properties—in exchange for in-kind construction and infrastructure repairs on Ford Island. This unprecedented arrangement was made possible through special legislation passed by Congress in 1999. The Navy gave the developers a 65-year lease of Iroquois Point/Puuloa, a parcel on Ford Island, and the Hālawa Landing—all underutilized Navy properties. The developers also were allowed to purchase of housing at Kalaeloa after three years and given outright ownership of the former Waikele Naval Magazine (Gordon, 2005).

Built in the 1960s, the homes on the north side of Puuloa Lagoon were empty when renovations began in August 2003, with more than 100 tradesmen working on a daily basis, moving block by block through the housing development. Something less than half of the 1,463 homes were upgraded with an initial investment of about $20 million. Beyond that, several million dollars is to be invested for amenities, such as a community center (Gordon, 2005). Iroquois Point housing lies directly under the glideslope of runway 8L of Honolulu International Airport. Neighborhood residents are often witness to large commercial and military jets that land at the airport flying low over the area.

==Education==
Hawaii Department of Education operates public schools. Iroquois Point Elementary School is in the area though it is outside the CDP and has an Ewa Beach postal address.

<text>Stralsund (; Swedish: &quot;Strålsund&quot;), officially the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] City of Stralsund (German: &quot;Hansestadt Stralsund&quot;), is the fifth-largest city in the northeastern German federal state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania after Rostock, Schwerin, Neubrandenburg and Greifswald, and the second-largest city in the Pomeranian part of the state. It is located on the southern coast of the Strelasund, a sound of the Baltic Sea separating the island of Rügen from the Pomeranian mainland.

The Strelasund Crossing with its two bridges and several ferry services connects Stralsund with Rügen, the largest island of Germany and Pomerania. The Western Pomeranian city is the seat of the Vorpommern-Rügen district and, together with Greifswald, Stralsund forms one of four high-level urban centres of the region.

The city&#x27;s name as well as that of the Strelasund are compounds of the Slavic (Polabian) &quot;stral&quot; and &quot;strela&quot; (arrow; Polish: &quot;strzała&quot;, Czech: &quot;střela&quot;) and the Germanic &quot;sund&quot;, a strait or sound. The canting arms of the city make reference to that etymology as well as to Stralsund&#x27;s Hanseatic past in featuring a silver cross pattée (a Hanseatic Cross) above a silver arrow.

Stralsund was granted city rights in 1234 and is thus the oldest city in Pomerania. It was one of the most prosperous members of the medieval Hanseatic League. In 1628, during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the city came under Swedish rule and remained so until the upheavals of the Napoleonic Wars. It was the capital of Swedish Pomerania (New Western Pomerania) from 1720 to 1815. From 1815 to 1945, Stralsund was part of Prussia.

Stralsund&#x27;s old town is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site &quot;Historic Centres of Stralsund and Wismar&quot; alongside the old town of Wismar in Mecklenburg because of its outstanding Brick Gothic buildings and its importance during the time of the Hanseatic League and when the city belonged to Sweden. St Mary&#x27;s Church has been the tallest church in the world from 1549 to 1569 and from 1573 to 1647. The city&#x27;s other two large churches are St Nicholas&#x27; and St James&#x27;. Stralsund is the seat of the German Oceanographic Museum (&quot;Deutsches Meeresmuseum&quot;) with its satellites Ozeaneum (in Stralsund), Nautineum (on Dänholm Island), and Natureum (on the Fischland-Darß-Zingst Peninsula).

The main industries of Stralsund are shipbuilding, fishing, mechanical engineering, and, to an increasing degree, tourism, life sciences, services and high tech industries, especially information technology and biotechnology.

==Geography==
===Location===
The city of Stralsund is located in northeastern Germany in the region of Western Pomerania in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Stralsund is located south west of Rügen. It is separated by a small body of water named the Strelasund, which stretches out to the Baltic Sea.

===Climate===
Its annual precipitation is 656 mm (25.8 inches) and comparatively low, falling within the lowest third of all precipitation values in Germany. The driest month is February; the most precipitation falls in July. The precipitation varies relatively moderately throughout the year. Only 40% of weather stations in Germany exhibit lower seasonal variation.

===Landscape===
The city lies on the sound of Strelasund, a strait of the Baltic Sea. Its geographic proximity to the island of Rügen, whose only fixed link to the mainland, the Strelasund Crossing, runs between Stralsund and the village of Altefähr, has given Stralsund the sobriquet &quot;Gateway to the Island of Rügen&quot; (&quot;Tor zur Insel Rügen&quot;). Stralsund is located close to the Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park.

Stralsund&#x27;s city borough includes municipal forest and three municipal ponds (the &quot;Knieperteich, Frankenteich&quot; and &quot;Moorteich&quot;. The three ponds and the Strelasund lend the Old Town, the original settlement site and historic centre of the city, a protected island ambience. The highest point of the city is the &quot;Galgenberg&quot; (&quot;Gallows Hill&quot;) on its western approaches.

===Subdivisions===
The city&#x27;s territory covers an area of 54.07 km2, which makes Stralsund, with its nearly 58,000 inhabitants one of the most densely populated cities in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (1,480 inhabitants per km2).

The borough of the Hanseatic city of Stralsund is divided into as follows:

The city also possesses estates in the local area as well as on the islands of Rügen, Hiddensee and Ummanz.

===Neighbouring municipalities===
Larger cities in the nearby area are Greifswald and Rostock. In the local area around Stralsund there are also the towns of Barth and Ribnitz-Damgarten.

Many of the smaller villages in the vicinity, like Prohn or Negast, have grown sharply after 1990 as a result of the influx of those living or working in Stralsund.

==History==

In the Middle Ages the Stralsund area formed part of the West Slavic Principality of Rügen. At that time the Dänholm isle and fishing village, both at the site of the latter city, were called &quot;Strale&quot; or &quot;Stralow&quot;, Polabian for &quot;arrow&quot; (this meaning underlies the city&#x27;s coat of arms, which shows an arrow). The full Polabian name can be rendered in Polish as &quot;Strzałów&quot;.

The village also had a ferry to the island of Rügen. In 1168, following the siege of Arkona, the Principality of Rügen became part of Kingdom of Denmark.

In the course of German Ostsiedlung, many German settlers, gentry and merchants were invited to settle in the principality, and they eventually populated the &quot;Strale&quot; settlement. Merchants from other countries as well as locals were attracted to the area and made up one third of the settlement&#x27;s population. The Danish navy used the isle as well. When the settlement had grown to town size, prince Wizlaw I of Rügen granted Lübeck law to &quot;our town Stralow&quot; in 1234, although a significant settlement had existed long before the formal founding. In 1240, when the prince gave additional land to the town, he called it &quot;Stralesund&quot;.

The success of the settlement challenged the powerful Free City of Lübeck, which burnt Stralsund down in 1249. Afterwards the town was rebuilt with a massive town wall having 11 town gates and 30 watchtowers. The &quot;Neustadt&quot;, a town-like suburb, had merged with Stralsund by 1361. &quot;Schadegard&quot;, a nearby twin city to Stralsund also founded by Wizlaw I, though not granted German law, served as the principal stronghold and enclosed a fort. It was given up and torn down by 1269 under pressure from the Stralsund &quot;Bürger&quot;.

In 1293 Stralsund became a member of the Hanseatic League. A total of 300 ships flying the flag of Stralsund cruised the Baltic Sea in the 14th century. In 1325 the Principality of Rügen became part of the Duchy of Pomerania, Stralsund however maintained a considerable independence.

In the 17th century opposing forces in the Thirty Years&#x27; War fought over Stralsund. In the Battle of Stralsund (1628), the Imperial (Catholic) forces commanded by Albrecht von Wallenstein besieged the city after the council refused to accept the Capitulation of Franzburg of November 1627. Stralsund resisted with Danish and Swedish support. The Swedish garrison in Stralsund was the first on German soil in history. With the Treaty of Stettin (1630), the city became one of two major Swedish forts in the Duchy of Pomerania, alongside Stettin (now Szczecin, Poland).

After the war, the Peace of Westphalia (1648) and the Treaty of Stettin (1653) made Stralsund part of Swedish Pomerania. Lost to Brandenburg in the Battle of Stralsund (1678), it reverted to Sweden in the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679). In the Great Northern War in 1715 Charles XII led the defence of Stralsund for a year against the united European armies. Stralsund remained under Swedish control until the Battle of Stralsund (1807), when Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s army occupied it. Seized by Ferdinand von Schill&#x27;s freikorps in 1809, it subsequently reverted to French control, with Schill killed in action. With the Congress of Vienna (1815), Stralsund became a part of the Prussian Province of Pomerania and the seat of a government region resembling the former Swedish Pomerania.

Following the First World War Stralsund suffered the same sort of political unrest and unemployment that afflicted much of Germany. In May 1919 Stralsund workers clashed with police, and martial law was declared. In the early 1920s the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD) became the strongest party in Stralsund, but its political fortunes waned rapidly, and in September 1922 it reunited with the Social Democratic Party (SPD). The &quot;Stralsunder Zeitung&quot; was published as a local newspaper in Stralsund.

In the national parliamentary election of May 1924, the conservative German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP) polled 8,547 votes in Stralsund, the SPD 3,534, the Communists 1,825 and the German People&#x27;s Party (DVP) of Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann 1,417. However, in keeping with national trends, Hitler&#x27;s National Socialists made rapid gains in the late 1920s, and by the time of the last free national election in July 1932 the Nazis polled twice as many votes in Stralsund as the SPD.

During the Nazi period (1933–1945), Stralsund&#x27;s military installations expanded, and a naval training base opened on the nearby island of Dänholm. In World War II the city was subjected to repeated Allied bombing. Attacks by the U.S. Army Air Forces in 1944 killed some 800 Stralsunders and destroyed an estimated 8,000 dwellings. The 354th Rifle Division of the Red Army occupied Stralsund on April 28, 1945 – 10 days before the end of the war in Europe. Approximately half its population had fled.

During the period of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), Stralsund saw the construction of numerous &quot;Plattenbau&quot; prefabricated apartment blocks. Its economic life centered on the now state-owned shipyard, which largely focussed on building ships for the Soviet Union.

After German reunification in 1990, the city&#x27;s historic old town was thoroughly restored, and Communist-era apartment blocks were renovated and upgraded. In 2002 the old towns of Stralsund and Wismar, some 120 km to the west, were listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Stralsund&#x27;s shipyard was privatized, and thereafter specialized in constructing container ships.

==Culture and sights==
===Main sights===
* The historic Stralsund old town island is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It features many valuable remnants of the Hanseatic time, Brick Gothic, renaissance, baroque, historicist and Jugendstil buildings.
* The heart of the old town is the Alter Markt Square (&quot;Old Market&quot;), with the Gothic city hall (13th century). Behind the city hall soars the imposing St. Nicholas&#x27; Church, built in 1270–1360. The square is surrounded by houses from different periods, including the Gothic &quot;Wulflamhaus&quot; (a 14th-century patrician house, today a restaurant), and the Baroque &quot;Commandantenhus&quot; of 1751, the old headquarters of the Swedish military commander.
* Saint James&#x27; Church, built in mid-14th century. It was destroyed several times, e.g. by Wallenstein and in World War II.
* Saint Mary&#x27;s Church, built in 1383–1473 in Gothic style, is the largest church in Stralsund, and from 1625 to 1647 it was the world&#x27;s tallest structure. Its octagonal tower (104 meters high) offers a panorama view of Stralsund and the neighboring islands of Rügen and Hiddensee.

* St. John&#x27;s Abbey (Franciscan monastery built in 1254) is one of the oldest buildings in the city.
* Stralsund is the port of registry for the former German Reichsmarine Navy Sail Training ship &quot;&quot;Gorch Fock&quot; 1&quot;. It is now a floating museum.
* The Monastery of Saint Catherine, mainly built in the 15th century, houses two museums today: Stralsund&#x27;s &quot;Museum of Cultural History&quot; (known for e.g. the &quot;Gold Jewellery of Hiddensee&quot;), and the German Oceanographic Museum, Germany&#x27;s largest aquarium and oceanographic collection. The ancient refectory of the monastery is one of the most spectacular Gothic interiors in Germany.
* Besides the mentioned German Oceanographic Museum at the Katharinenkloster, Stralsund has other museums dedicated to marine life, including the popular Ozeaneum that was voted &quot;European Museum of the Year&quot; in 2010. There is also a nautical centre, the Nautineum, on Dänholm island and the &quot;Marinemuseum Dänholm&quot;, showcasing the military history of the German Navy, especially the interwar Reichsmarine. It also hosts one of the last remaining GDR Volksmarine (People&#x27;s Navy) torpedo boats.

===Buildings and monuments===

;Old Town (&quot;Altstadt&quot;)
The centre of Stralsund has a wealth of historic buildings. Since 1990, large parts of the historic old town have been renovated with private and public capital, and with the support of foundations. As a result of the contempt for historic buildings in East Germany many houses were threatened by ruin. The Old Town in particular offers a rich variety of historic buildings, with many former merchants&#x27; houses, churches, streets and squares. 

Of more than 800 listed buildings in Stralsund, more than 500 are designated as individual monuments in the Old Town. In twenty years, from the &quot;Wende&quot; (turning point) in 1990 to November 2010, 588 of the more than 1,000 old buildings were completely refurbished, including 363 individual monuments. Because of its historical and architectural significance, in 2002 Stralsund&#x27;s old town together with the old town of Wismar were added to entitled the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage list as the &quot;Historic Centres of Stralsund and Wismar&quot;.
;Alter Markt Square
On the Alter Markt Square there is the main landmark of Stralsund: the Brick Gothic city hall from Hanseatic times. This building from 1278 features a remarkable &quot;show façade&quot; that serves the sole purpose of displaying wealth of the city. Citizens can walk through the city hall and its gallery. It also features one of Europe&#x27;s largest Gothic cellar vaults. The ensemble of buildings on the Alter Markt Square includes the St. Nicholas Church, the Artushof, the Wulflamhaus, the Commandantenhus, the Gewerkschaftshaus and a new apartment complex. 
;Old Town houses
The historic houses with their distinctive gables, often renovated at a high financial cost, dominate the scene in the streets of the Old Town. The former Swedish Government Palace is now home to the city construction department. The Museum of Cultural History Museum in &quot;Mönchstrasse&quot;, in one of the most important surviving original houses of the Hanseatic era, was refurbished with funds from the German Foundation for Monument Conservation It offers a guide to understanding the city&#x27;s history over seven centuries.

;Churches
Three large medieval Brick Gothic buildings – St. Mary&#x27;s Church, St. Nicholas Church and St. James Church, point to the medieval significance of Stralsund. Today St. James&#x27; is used purely as a cultural venue, its parish being served now by the Church of the Holy Spirit, which also dates from the 14th century. Two other churches on the Alter Markt Square and the Neuer Markt are still used for church services. The tower of St. Mary&#x27;s on the Neuer Markt offers a panoramic view over Stralsund and the island of Rügen. 
;Monasteries
St. John&#x27;s Abbey, a Franciscan monastery from 1254, now houses the Stralsund City Archives. Regular cultural events also take place here, such as open-air theatre productions.

The Gothic abbey of St. Anne and St. Bridget in &quot;Schillstrasse&quot; was established around 1560 from the merger of the abbey of &quot;St. Anne&quot; (1480) and the double abbey of &quot;Mariakron&quot; (1421).

The Abbey of St. Jürgen on &quot;Mönchstrasse&quot; was mentioned in 1278 for the first time. It served in the 14th century as an old people&#x27;s home. In 1743 a new building, the &quot;Kleines St. Jürgen Kloster&quot;, was built at &quot;Kniepertor&quot; and the site was extended in 1754 to create old people&#x27;s flats and in 1841 for widow&#x27;s apartments.

First mentioned in 1256, the &quot;Heilgeistkloster&quot; is now the Hospital of the Holy Spirit.
;Port
Ferries to Hiddensee and Altefähr, as well as harbor tour boats, dock at the port. In the summer months the port is a berthing places for river cruisers. There are several yacht harbors and marinas near the Old Town. Hundreds of yachts and boats tie up along the north mole in summer. Architecturally the pilot station and the harbor warehouse (&quot;Hafenspeicher&quot;), as well as the silhouette of the Old Town, form a unique tableau of different historical eras. The barque and former sailor&#x27;s training ship, &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; is another tourist attraction at the harbor.

==Education==

The Fachhochschule Stralsund is a &quot;University of Applied Sciences&quot; with a modern campus, north of the old town at the Strelasund. It has around 2,500 students and is among the best ranked public universities in Germany in various fields, especially in economics. Other university departments are Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Information Technology. The FH Stralsund also offers international study programs, such as &quot;Leisure and Tourism Management&quot; and &quot;Baltic Management Studies&quot; (international business management).

==Transport==
Stralsund is linked to the A20 motorway (towards Berlin and Hamburg), via the B96n dual-carriageway. Other major roads include the B105 (beginning in the city centre and continuing to Rostock) and the B96 (major road to Rügen) and the B194 to the town of Grimmen.

Stralsund Hauptbahnhof is on the line to Berlin, Rostock, Pasewalk and Bergen.

When travelling by air, passengers usually do so via Rostock-Laage Airport with connecting flights from Munich. A small airport, Stralsund Barth Airport, also serves the city locally.

City buses are run by SWS (Stadtwerke Stralsund).

==Governance==
The current mayor of Stralsund is Alexander Badrow (CDU) since 2008. The most recent mayoral election was held on 8 May 2022, and the results were as follows:

<doc id="110515" wikidata="Q532459" url="?curid=110515" title="Kailua, Hawaii">
<text>Kailua () is a census-designated place (CDP) in Honolulu County, Hawaii, United States. It lies in the Koolaupoko District of the island of Oahu on the windward coast at Kailua Bay. It is in the judicial district and the ahupua&#x27;a named Ko&#x27;olaupoko. It is northeast of Honolulu – over Nu‘uanu Pali.

In the Hawaiian language &quot;Kailua&quot; means &quot;two seas&quot; or &quot;two currents&quot;, a contraction of the words &quot;kai&quot; (meaning &quot;sea&quot; or &quot;sea water&quot;) and &quot;elua&quot; (meaning &quot;two&quot;); it is so named because of the two former fishponds in the district (Kawainui and Kaelepulu) or the two currents that run through Kailua Bay.

Kailua is primarily a residential community, with a centralized commercial district along Kailua Road. The population was 50,000 in 1992. In 2017 census, the population had dropped to 38,000. The population was 40,514 at the 2020 census.

Places of note in Kailua include Kailua Beach Park, Kaōhao or Lanikai Beach, Kawainui Marsh, Maunawili Falls, and Marine Corps Base Hawaii. It was home to Barack Obama’s winter White House.

== History ==
===Early history===
During the reign of King Kākuhihewa and his successors, Kanekapu, Kahoowaha, Kauakahiakahoowaha, and Kualiʻi, Kailua replaced Waikiki as the residential seat of the Oʻahu Rulers (&quot;aliʻi nui&quot; of Oʻahu). Many ancient temple ruins, such as those at Ulupo Heiau State Historic Site, are in the area. After the Oʻahu army&#x27;s defeat by King Kamehameha the Great at the Battle of Nuʻuanu in 1795, the political capital and residential seat of the aliʻi nui of Oʻahu was relocated from Kailua to Honolulu.

==Beach==
Kailua Beach is crescent-shaped, about long, and ranging between wide. The ocean bottom fronting the beach slopes gently to overhead depths without any coral heads. Light to medium waves support surfing and bodysurfing. The steady trade winds make Kailua Beach a top windsurfing and kitesurfing destination. Robby Naish, first World Champion of windsurfing and Professional Windsurfers Association Hall of Fame inductee, grew up in Kailua.

Sea kayaking and stand-up paddleboarding to the protected seabird sanctuaries Flat Island and the Nā Mokulua, popularly known as &quot;the Mokes&quot;, have become increasingly popular water activities at the beach.

== Geography ==

Kailua is located at (21.397370, −157.739515). Nearby towns include Kāneohe, Maunawili, and Waimānalo.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has an area of , of which is land and (26.62%) is water. A significant portion of the water area is Kawainui Marsh, the largest wetland in the Hawaiian Islands and a Ramsar Convention site.

===Kaʻōhao/Lanikai===
Kaʻōhao () is the earliest known Hawaiian name for the place known as &quot;Lanikai.&quot; Kaʻōhao means &quot;the tying&quot; and is derived from an old story in which &quot;two women were tied together here with a loincloth after being beaten in a kōnane game&quot;. Kaʻōhao was commercially developed in the 1920s and renamed &quot;Lanikai.&quot; It is now an unincorporated community in Kailua on the windward coast at Kailua Bay. Lanikai Beach was rated one of the world&#x27;s top ten beaches by &quot;Sherman&#x27;s Travel Magazine&quot;. The area is known for its white, powder-like sandy beach and its hiking trail along the Kaiwa Ridge to the World War II military bunkers commonly known as the &quot;Lanikai Pillboxes&quot;. Because of its small community and easy access to its famous beach, Lanikai has one of Hawaii&#x27;s most expensive real estate markets. It is served by Kailua&#x27;s zip code, 96734.

==Climate==
Kailua has a tropical savanna climate.

== Demographics ==

As of the census of 2020, there were an estimated 40,514 people and 12,387 households with an average of 3.04 people per household in Kailua. The population density was , which was less dense than that of Honolulu (5842.0 per square mile or 2255.6/km2). There were 4,322 housing units in Kailua at an average density of .

The racial makeup of Kailua was 44.8% White, 0.9% Black or African American, 0.2% Native American, 19.3% Asian, 4.4% Pacific Islander, 1.4% from other races, and 29.0% from two or more races. The Kailua population had a greater percentage of White residents and a lower percentage of Asian residents than the state in aggregate (25.3% and 38.6% respectively). 8.6% of the Kailua population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

12.7% of Kailua residents reported having a language other than English spoken at home, less than the state average of 26.1%. The age of the population in Kailua was varied, with 5.8% of inhabitants being under the age of 5, 21.6% being under the age of 18, and 19.3% being above the age of 65.

==Government and infrastructure==
The Honolulu Police Department operates the Kailua Substation in Kailua. The United States Postal Service operates the Kailua Post Office.

The Hawaii Department of Public Safety operates the Women&#x27;s Community Correctional Center; it was defined in the Maunawili CDP as of the 2000 U.S. Census, but was redefined as being in the Kailua CDP as of the 2010 U.S. Census. NBC News stated that the prison was in Kailua.

The Hawaii Department of Human Services operates the Hawaii Youth Correctional Facility (HYCF), which was defined as Maunawili by the Census Bureau in 2000, and as Kailua by the same organization in 2010. The United States Department of Justice also stated the facility was in Kailua.

== Tourism ==


Historically, most tourism on the island of O&#x27;ahu has centered around Waikiki and other tourism-designated areas. But tourism has also been a major economic force in Kailua, and tourism-related jobs have historically made up roughly one-third of total employment in Hawaii. The Obama family vacations, as well as coverage from various social media and travel sites, sparked new interest in Kailua as a tourist destination and led to an influx of tourists to Kailua. This influx led to pushback from some Kailua residents, prompting proposals of legislation to limit tourist activity there.

===Winter White House===
Barack Obama vacationed in Kailua between 2008 and 2012. In 2010, 2011, and 2012, the Obama family stayed in the rented, ocean-front house Plantation Estate in the Paradise Point Estates. The house was built by developer Harold Kainalu Long Castle, who also lived there. Obama also took a vacation break in August 2008 at a different house in Kailua, Oahu Lani, during the 2008 United States presidential election.
=== Controversy ===
Although tourism is the primary driver of Kailua&#x27;s economy, it remains a contentious issue among the town&#x27;s residents. On several occasions, residents have successfully introduced legislation to discourage tourism in the town. One such example is Bill 41, introduced to the Honolulu City Council in October 2021. In 2022, Honolulu County Mayor Rick Blangiardi signed Bill 41 into law at a press conference held on Kailua beach. The bill places additional limits and restrictions on short-term rental units. These include requiring a permit to rent living space in a residential area for less than 90 days, as well as requiring hosting platforms (such as Airbnb) to report all listings in Honolulu County (which includes Kailua town) to the county government. Proponents of Bill 41 expect its passage to dramatically reduce the volume of tourists in Kailua.

MCBH is home for the 3rd Marine Littoral Regiment, Marine Aircraft Group 24, Combat Logistics Company 33 (CLC-33), 3rd Radio Battalion, and the Navy&#x27;s Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing 2.

The base lies between the two largest windward O&#x27;ahu communities of Kailua and Kāne&#x27;ohe, and the main gate is reached at the eastern end of Interstate H-3. The main access to the base is by either H-3 or Mokapu Road. MCB Hawaii is located on the windward side of Oahu, approximately northeast of Honolulu. Marine Corps Base Hawaii occupies the entire Mokapu Peninsula, an area of . Two areas of the base are classified as conservation land, including the Ulupaʻu Crater area (northeast peninsula) and the Nu&#x27;upia Pond area (at the Mokapu Road).

==History==
In 1918, President Woodrow Wilson designated of land on Mokapu Peninsula for the military. The Kuwaahoe Military Reservation, became known later, in 1942 as Fort Hase. In 1941, Army artillery units moved into the area. In 1939, the Navy constructed a small seaplane base and upon its completion, Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay&#x27;s role was expanded to include the administration of the Kaneohe Bay Naval Defense Sea Area.

===Attack on Pearl Harbor===
On 7 December 1941, Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay was attacked approximately 9 minutes before the attack on Pearl Harbor. The gunners there shot down 3 airplanes, two went into Kaneohe Bay while another one crashed into the base of Radar Hill. The crash site has a memorial to the pilot who died. 

===Post World War II===
In 1951, the Marines assumed control of the air station activities when naval aviation moved to Barbers Point Naval Air Station. On 15 January 1952, Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay was commissioned. On 15 April 1994, the Marine Corps consolidated all of its installations in Hawaii. MCAS Kaneohe Bay, Camp H. M. Smith, Molokai Training Support Facility, Manana Family Housing Area, Puuloa Range, and the Pearl City Warehouse Annex combined to form a new command, the Marine Corps Base Hawaii, headquartered at MCBH Kaneohe Bay.

All U.S. military units located in Hawaii fall under the command of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) which is headquartered at Camp H. M. Smith on Oahu. The Commanding General of Marine Forces Pacific (MARFORPAC) also commands 12 Marine Corps bases and stations in Arizona, California, Hawaii, and Japan, operational forces in Hawaii and Okinawa Prefecture, and units deployed to Southeast/west Asia.

In 2010, parts of the movie &quot;Battleship&quot; were filmed aboard MCBH.

===Incidents===
On 20 November 2023, a P-8A Poseidon of the US Navy approached to land on Runway 22 in rain and reduced visibility. It was unable to stop and overshot the runway, ending in Kāneʻohe Bay. The crew of 9 was rescued by US Coast Guard boats. The plane was from Patrol Squadron 4 (&quot;Skinny Dragons&quot;) based at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island in Washington state.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the base has a total area of , of which is land and , or 24.74%, is water. It is dominated by two large volcanic formations, Radar Hill and Ulapau Crater. Radar Hill stands 646ft tall and is home to Kansas Tower which is a former Radar Station hence the name Radar Hill. On the other side of the base lays Ulapau Crater. It stands 659ft tall and loms over the base. 

==Demographics==
For census purposes, the area is demarcated as the Kaneohe Base census-designated place (CDP), with a population at the 2020 Census of 9,483. The CDP was formerly known as Kaneohe Station.

===2020 census===
===2000 Census===
As of the 2000 census, there were 11,827 people, 2,332 households, and 2,283 families residing on the base. The population density was . There were 2,388 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the base was 66.6% White, 12.1% African American, 1.1% Native American, 5.3% Asian, 1.2% Pacific Islander, 7.6% from other races, and 6.1% from two or more races. 14.6% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. For every 100 women, there were 202.6 men. For every 100 women age 18 and over, there were 258.8 men. The median income for a household on the base was $34,757.

==Education==
The Hawaii Department of Education operates Mokapu Elementary School on the MCBH property which goes from kindergarten to 6th grade. its enrollment was about 900, making it the largest school by enrollment on the Windward side of the island.

==Renewable energy and &quot;green&quot; initiatives==
Since 2004, MCBH has partnered with Ocean Power Technologies to test the generation of electric power from ocean waves using a &quot;PowerBuoy&quot; wave energy converter, one of the first wave power projects in the U.S.

The Azura wave power device is currently being tested in a 30-meter site at the base.

Marine Corps Base Hawaii, under commanding officer Col. Robert Rice, installed solar water heaters on all base housing units, and on 8 December 2010, was scheduled to debut a &quot;Net Zero&quot; sustainable energy home, which uses solar power. The base fleet of government vehicles is also being changed over to hybrid and electric vehicles and most other &quot;FlexFuel&quot; vehicles now operate on E85 ethanol-based fuel. MCB Hawaii installed the first E85 pump in the state of Hawaii in November 2010, the first U.S. military installation in the world to do so.

<text>Kawela Bay is a census-designated place and small community in the Koolauloa District on the northern coast of the island of Oahu, City &amp; County of Honolulu, Hawaii, United States. In Hawaiian, &quot;ka wela&quot; means &quot;the heat&quot;. As of the 2020 census, the CDP had a population of 325.

==Description==
Kawela Bay is adjacent to (just west of) the Turtle Bay Resort. Land for a Kawela Bay Beach park was allocated, but not improved. Coastal features and shorelines (including Kawela Bay itself) are mostly hidden from the traveler along Kamehameha Highway, although access to the shore can be found at Waialee Beach Park with Kukaimanini, an offshore islet. This area to the west is the North Shore of Oahu. For those travelling east, the road turns inland at Kawela to cross the Kahuku Plain where the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge preserves some wetland habitat, coming again to the coast at Hukilau Beach in Lāie on the windward (&quot;koolau&quot;) side of Oahu.

The U.S. postal code for Kawela Bay, Turtle Bay and nearby Kuilima is 96731.

<text>Laie (, ) is a census-designated place (CDP) located in the Koolauloa District on the island of Oahu () in Honolulu County, Hawaii, United States. In Hawaiian, means &quot; leaf&quot; ( is a climbing screwpine: &quot;Freycinetia arborea&quot;). The population was 5,963 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Historically, was a , a sanctuary for fugitives. While a fugitive was in the , it was unlawful for that fugitive&#x27;s pursuers to harm him or her. During wartime, spears with white flags attached were set up at each end of the city of refuge. If warriors attempted to pursue fugitives into the , they would be killed by sanctuary priests. Fugitives seeking sanctuary in a city of refuge were not forced to permanently live within the confines of its walls. Instead, they were given two choices. In some cases, after a certain length of time (ranging from a couple of weeks to several years), fugitives could enter the service of the priests and assist in the daily affairs of the . A second option was that after a certain length of time the fugitives would be free to leave and re-enter the world unmolested. Traditional cities of refuge were abolished in 1819.

The history of began long before European contact. The name is said to derive from two Hawaiian words: meaning &quot;leaf&quot;, and referring to the (red-spiked climbing screwpine, &quot;Freycinetia arborea&quot;), which wreaths forest trees of the uplands or regions of the mountains of the Range behind the community of . In Hawaiian mythology, this red-spiked climbing screwpine is sacred to , god of the earth, god of life, and god of the forests, as well as to , the patron goddess of the hula.

The name becomes more environmentally significant through the Hawaiian oral history () entitled . In this history, the term , which means &quot;in the water&quot;, also belongs to the food-producing tree called . The tree was planted in a place called &#x27;s garden, which is closely associated with the spiritual home, after her birth and relocation of . According to Hawaiian oral traditions, the planting of the tree in the garden of is symbolic of the reproductive energy of male and female, which union in turns fills the land with offspring. From its close association with nature through its name, and through its oral traditions and history, the community of takes upon itself a precise identification and a responsibility in perpetuating life and in preserving all life forms. Sometimes the land itself provided sanctuary for the Hawaiian people. was such a place. The earliest information about states that it was a small, sparsely populated village with a major distinction: &quot;it was a city of refuge&quot;. Within this city of refuge were located at least two , traditional Hawaiian temples, of which very little remains today. was destroyed, but its remains can be found in taro patches (seaward) of Laie Hawaii Temple belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Towards the mountain (), the remains of can be found on a small ridge. All that is left of is a coral platform.

Between 1846 and 1848, the traditional Hawaiian feudal ownership of land by the king, the , and his leading chiefs or was changed through the Great, or major land division. The at the time was King Kamehameha III, and his (leading chief) for was (which means &quot;The Chief without Riches&quot;); the wife to this descended directly from the of named Kakuiewa, making his wife of higher rank than he. The result of the was not in compliance with the original intent of Kamehameha III. The result was that the chiefs received about , the king kept about , which were called crown lands, and about were set aside as government lands.

The land of the itself was cut up into parcels, much like the traditional Hawaiian land divisions, centering on the , which followed a fairly uniform pattern. Each parcel was shaped roughly like a piece of pie with the tip in the mountains, the middle section in the foothills and coastal plain, and the broad base along the ocean front and the sea. The size and shape of the varied. However, the purpose of these remained the same. The village of is located in the of . As such, followed the general pattern of life in the , but only the valleys in the foothills had ample water. There were ten streams that flowed through the of before 1865 (see 1865 map). Their names were , , , , , , , , , and . There were more streams flowing through the of than through any of the other surrounding , including and to the southeast and , , and to the northwest.

===Latter-day Saints===
A new phase of development for began when the plantation of that name was purchased by George Nebeker, the president of the LDS Church&#x27;s Hawaiian Mission. The Latter-day Saints in Hawaii were then encouraged to move to this location. This purchase occurred in 1865. The sugarcane plantation was rarely profitable, and through 1879 the church had subsidized its operations with about $40,000.

Soon after the settlement a sugar factory was built. Much of the land was used to grow sugar, but other food crops were also raised. Significantly, was one of the few sugarcane plantations where both (taro) and sugar were grown simultaneously. This was unusual because sugar and are both thirsty crops. In the plantation economy of Hawaii in the late 19th century and early 20th century, usually lost out to sugar. One of the reasons both and sugar grew on the plantation is because of the commitment of Hawaiian plantation workers to growing their staple. Their dedication to growing included their insistence that Saturday not be a work day on the plantation so that they could make for their families. Both schools and church buildings were constructed in the town in the ensuing years.

Samuel E. Woolley, who served as the LDS Church&#x27;s mission president for 24 years, pushed the expansion of the operations at Laie. In 1898 he negotiated a $50,000 loan that allowed for the building of a new pump.

The Hawaiian Mission was headquartered in until 1919 when the headquarters were moved to Honolulu, but by then the temple had been built in , so it remained the spiritual center of the Latter-day Saint community in Hawaii.

<text>Mākaha (Hawaiian for &quot;fierce&quot;, or &quot;savage&quot;, ) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Honolulu County, Hawaii, United States. It is a town located along the Pacific coast, west of the Mākaha Valley, and at the foot of Mt. Ka&#x27;ala in the Wai’anae Mountain Range. It is the last of the leeward towns on O&#x27;ahu. North of Mākaha there is no development, i.e. no towns, no gas stations, or restaurants. The population of Mākaha was 8,278 at the 2010 census. It is located 35 miles northwest of Honolulu, but is a part of Honolulu County.

In the Hawaiian language its name means “fierce” or “savage”, which refers to the group of bandits who were based in the Mākaha Valley. They would hide and wait for unsuspecting passersby to show up, and then plunder and pillage them. Mākaha has a higher percentage of Native Hawaiians and other Pacific islanders than most settlements on O’ahu; 26.2% of the population were Pacific Islanders in 2010. Mākaha Resort stages weekend traditional Hawaiian arts and crafts fairs and other Hawaiian cultural programs in order to preserve the Native Hawaiian traditions in Mākaha.

The town is particularly known for its surfing waves and surfing history, the Hawaiian temple Kāne’āki Heiau, and Mākaha Beach Park, which is a nesting place for several species of sea turtles. Aside from surfing, other water activities include diving, canoe-surfing, fishing, tandem surfing, bodysurfing, and other recreational water sports. Kāne’āki Heiau is Hawaii&#x27;s most thoroughly restored ancient heiau, it was excavated by Bishop Museum archeologists in 1970 and can now be visited Tuesdays-Sundays. It originated as an agricultural temple to the god Lono in the 15th century. 200 years later, it was converted into a luakini, where human sacrifices were dedicated to the god Kū – a typical progression indicating Mākaha now supported a large enough population to have its own chief.

== Surfing ==

Surfing is sometimes recognized as starting in Mākaha in the early 1950s, even though it has most likely been utilized as a surfing spot for Native Hawaiians for hundreds of years. During summer, the waves tend to be at maximum four feet; however, during the winter surf season, the waves often exceed fifteen feet. Attracted by these waves, sometimes as high as 25 feet high, the Waikīkī Surf Club established the Mākaha International Surfing Championships in 1952, the first of the many international surfing contests that are now held in Hawaii. One of the most popular events still held at Mākaha is Buffalo&#x27;s Big Board Contest, an annual surf contest named in honor of Mākaha lifeguard and surfing legend Richard “Buffalo” Keaulana. In these waters, Buffalo not only invented some of the most outrageous methods of surfing, but also raised his world champion son Rusty. He also made Mākaha the home of the world&#x27;s first international surf meet in 1954 and still hosts his Big Board Surfing Classic. Rell Sunn&#x27;s Menehune Triple Lei of Surfing is another annual surfing event that finds place in Mākaha. Besides Mākaha Beach Park, other surfing areas in Mākaha includes for instance Aki&#x27;s Beach, the Blowhole, Bowl, Charlie&#x27;s Reef, and Cornets. water

The residential developments extend only part way back into the valley, which is quite large and fairly wet, supporting limited agriculture (mostly banana growing) behind the housing. Water from the numerous streams is diverted by a ditch to much drier Waimānalo to support agricultural activities there.

A golf course and the Hawaiian Agriculture Research Center are located in the valley. The agriculture research station is also home to a sugar cane, coffee and cacao breeding program. An attraction of increasing popularity is the Maunawili Demonstration Trail, a state-maintained trail that traverses the breadth of upper Maunawili Valley from the Pali Highway (access at the &quot;Horseshoe Curve&quot;) to Waimānalo. A connecting side trail (Maunawili Falls Trail) is accessible from the neighborhood in upper Maunawili.

<doc id="110525" wikidata="Q2003096" url="?curid=110525" title="Mililani, Hawaii">
<text>Mililani () is a city located near the center of the island of Oahu in Honolulu County, Hawaiʻi, United States. It consists of two census-designated places, Mililani Town, with a population of 28,121 at the 2020 census, and Mililani Mauka, with a 2020 census population of 21,075.

==History==
Mililani sits on former plantation fields owned by Castle &amp; Cooke, which began planning for its development in 1958 under its Oceanic Properties subsidiary. Castle &amp; Cooke&#x27;s plan was to collaborate with planners and architects on making Mililani Town a satellite city that would satisfy Oʻahu&#x27;s pent-up demand for housing with a new affordable community. It was planned to eventually support a population of 75,000 people. Architect and developer Al Boeke, who would later create the planned community of Sea Ranch, California, was the development director of Mililani. The first homes in Mililani went on sale on June 23, 1968.

In 1976, Interstate H-2 opened for Mililani, cutting travel time from Mililani to Honolulu in half. In 1986, Mililani was named an All-America City in recognition of a community effort to clean up drinking water contaminated with agricultural pesticides. It is the only community in Hawaiʻi ever to receive this distinction.

On April 6, 1990, ground was broken for Mililani Mauka, a newer and more upscale community east of the Interstate H-2. The first homeowners moved into Mauka in 1992.

In 2003, Mililani was designated as the pilot site for the City and County of Honolulu&#x27;s curbside recycling program. In 2005, &quot;Money&quot; magazine named Mililani as one of the best places to live in the U.S. In 2006, Mililani ʻIke Elementary School first grade teacher Phyllis Nakama-Kawamoto was named Hawaiʻi&#x27;s American Star of Teaching by the U.S. Department of Education.

==Description==
Mililani is the third wealthiest zip code (96789) in the state of Hawaiʻi, according to the 2006 ranking by Pacific Business News. Although it is largely a bedroom community for Honolulu, Mililani has its own commercial shopping centers, schools (such as Mililani High School), parks, community centers, and a golf course. Mililani homeowners must pay dues to the Mililani Town Association, which enforces covenants and design standards, and provides recreational facilities including several pools.

The Mililani Golf Club is a par-72, 6,455-yard course that is open to the public. The Mililani Technology Park is a nearby campus-like park that is zoned for high-tech industries.

The older portion of Mililani to the west of Interstate H-2 is known as Mililani Town. The newer portion of Mililani to the east of Interstate H-2 is known as Mililani Mauka. Almost all of Mililani&#x27;s commercial and retail centers are in Mililani Town. A third region of Mililani is Launani Valley, a secluded, master planned development located below Mililani Tech Park on Wikao Street. The area was developed by Towne and contains a blend of townhome and single family units.

Nānākuli is home to one of the oldest Hawaiian Home Land Divisions established through the Native Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1921, promoted by Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole. The presence of DHHL (Department of Hawaiian Home Lands) has heavily influenced the Nānākuli community. Uniquely in the state of Hawaiʻi and for the last 50 years, three Nānākuli public schools have campuses located on Hawaiian Home Lands. These are Nānākuli High and Intermediate, Nānā I Ka Pono, and Nānākuli Elementary. Within the last two decades, Native Hawaiian based learning has been offered for students of the valley; at Nānākuli Elementary, kids can join a Hawaiian language immersion program (Kula Kai O Puni). 
Aside from the Department Of Education, there also exists &quot;Ka Waihona O Ka Naʻauao Hawaiian Public Charter School&quot;. 
In recent years, the neighborhood board acknowledged the long-standing history of the valley and DHHL by renaming Nānākuli Beach Park after Kalaniʻanaole.
Some other Native Hawaiian organizations that have reached out to this community are the Liliʻuokalani Trust (Formerly known as the Queen Liʻliʻuokalani Children&#x27;s Center, The Office Of Hawaiian Affairs, and Kamehameha Schools). 
Only 3,970 reported residents identify with having some sort of Hawaiian ancestry out of the approximate population of 12,000.

In April 2021, Kamehameha Schools opened the Kalanihookaha Community Learning Center in Nānākuli.

==Education==
The Hawaii Department of Education operates the public schools. Two elementary schools, Nanaikapono and Nanakuli, and the Nanakuli High &amp; Intermediate School are in the CDP.

<text>Pūpūkea () is a community and census-designated place (CDP) in the Koolauloa District on the island of Oahu, City &amp; County of Honolulu, Hawaii, United States. In Hawaiian, &quot;pūpūkea&quot; means &quot;white shell&quot;. As of the 2020 census, the CDP had a population of 5,130. The Koolauloa District ends at Waimea Bay, with the Waialua District extending south and westward.

Pūpūkea is a popular area on Oahu&#x27;s North Shore for living and for visiting. The best known surfing sites of Velzyland, Sunset (at Sunset Beach Park), Kammieland, Pūpūkea, Ehukai, Pipeline (these latter two off adjacent Ehukai Beach Park and Banzai Beach) and lesser breaks are arrayed off this shore. Popular diving and snorkeling areas known as Three Tables and Sharks Cove are located at Pūpūkea Beach Park. At the southwest end of Pūpūkea is Waimea Bay, with one of the most popular beaches on the island forming the shore at Waimea Beach Park.

Popular residential areas here include the beach lots at Sunset Beach and the uplands of Pūpūkea. As the properties in this area were subdivided in the 1950s and 60s and classified then as &quot;country&quot;, the lots in the uplands were all measured out in 1 acre or greater parcels. The biggest drawback to living in this part of the island, however, is the considerable driving distance of 37 miles (60 km) to Honolulu.

The U.S. postal code for Pūpūkea and the communities of Waialee, Sunset Beach, Lihilani, Waimea, and Kawailoa is 96712.
