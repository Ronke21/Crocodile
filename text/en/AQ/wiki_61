<text>Equality is a village in Gallatin County, Illinois, United States. The population was 539 at the 2020 census. Near the village are two points of interest, the Crenshaw House and the Garden of the Gods Wilderness. Equality was the county seat of Gallatin County from 1826–1851.

==History==

On Jan. 26, 1826, Equality was officially established by the General Assembly as the county seat of Gallatin County. The courthouse was built in 1827 for the amount of $1,300.00. Court was held there until 1851, when all legal documents were removed to Shawneetown, The building was later used as a school, church &amp; local society meetings. It was destroyed by fire Nov. 28, 1894.

===Salt Works===
French settlers extracted salt near Equality as early as 1735, while Native Americans made salt here long before then. In 1803, the American Indians ceded their &quot;Great Salt Springs&quot; to the US government by treaty. The government then leased the springs, requiring the holder to produce a certain quantity of salt each year or pay a penalty. The salt works is referred to as the &quot;United States Saline&quot; in old documents.

Isaac White was in charge of the salt works in 1811. White volunteered for the Indiana Militia that year, and was killed at the Battle of Tippecanoe.

Special territorial laws permitted exceptions to anti-slavery treaties at these salines, and slaves were used extensively in manufacturing salt. The census of 1820 for Gallatin County listed 239 slaves or servants.

During the 1820s, Gallatin County included what is now Saline County as its western half. In 1826, the county seat was moved from Old Shawneetown, on the eastern edge of the county, to the new village of Equality, near the center of what was then Gallatin County. Equality remained the county seat until the formation of Saline County in 1847.

In 1838, a local salt maker and illegal slave trader, John Hart Crenshaw, began building his manor house at Hickory Hill just five miles east of Equality; he used the house for his business of kidnapping free blacks and breeding slaves to sell into slavery as part of the Reverse Underground Railroad.

The Great Salt Springs are located southeast of Equality, on federal land along the south bank of the Saline River, seven-tenths of a mile west of Illinois Route 1 on Salt Well Road. Half Moon Lick, where the saltworks first developed as a large industry, is on private property southwest of Equality.

==Geography==
Equality is located in western Gallatin County at (37.736472, -88.344473), on the north side of the Saline River, a southeast-flowing tributary of the Ohio River.

According to the 2010 census, Equality has a total area of , of which (or 98.23%) is land and (or 1.77%) is water.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census there were 539 people, 218 households, and 129 families residing in the village. The population density was . There were 280 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the village was 96.67% White, 0.19% Asian, 0.19% from other races, and 2.97% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.04% of the population.

There were 218 households, out of which 27.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 36.70% were married couples living together, 20.64% had a female householder with no husband present.

The median income for a household in the village was $40,833, and the median income for a family was $48,750. About 20.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 12.9% of those under age 18 and 15.3% of those age 65 or over.

<text>Junction is a village in Gallatin County, Illinois, United States. The population was 56 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Junction was founded in the 1880s, and was named for its location at the junction of the L&amp;N and B&amp;O railroads. When a post office was established in 1884, it was named &quot;Cypress Junction.&quot; The name was changed to &quot;Junction City&quot; in 1888, and shortened to &quot;Junction&quot; in 1894.

Junction&#x27;s location in a relatively flat area leaves it prone to flooding along the Ohio River, which can cause waters in the nearby Saline River to back up. A major flood in March 1997 displaced several area residents and blocked all but one road leading into the village.

On June 1, 2022, Junction General Baptist Church burned down after lightning struck the steeple. 

===Crenshaw House===
The Hickory Hill mansion, almost five miles west of Junction, is the 19th-century home of illegal slave trader and slave breeder John Hart Crenshaw. It was infamously known as the &quot;Old Slave House,&quot; as it was used as a criminal front for the kidnapping of free blacks who were illegally sold into the Southern slave trade on the Reverse Underground Railroad, as well as a farm for slave breeding.

==Geography==
Junction is located at the center of Gallatin County at (37.722726, -88.237973). The village lies along Illinois Route 13, a few miles west of the Ohio River, and north of the Shawnee National Forest. The Saline River, a tributary of the Ohio, passes just to the south.

According to the 2010 census, Junction has a total area of , of which (or 99.66%) is land and (or 0.34%) is water.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 census, there were 56 people, 35 households, and 38 families residing in the village. The racial makeup of the village was 92.9% White. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.79% of the population.

There were 35 households, out of which 10.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 68.6% were married couples living together, 22.9% had a female householder with no husband present.

The median income for a household in the village was $32,375, and the median income for a family was $42,500. 45.5% of those over 64 were living below the poverty line.

<doc id="111218" wikidata="Q2597931" url="?curid=111218" title="Old Shawneetown, Illinois">
<text>Old Shawneetown is a village in Gallatin County, Illinois, United States. As of the 2020 census, the village had a population of 113, down from 193 at the 2010 census. Located along the Ohio River, Shawneetown served as an important United States government administrative center for the Northwest Territory. The village was devastated by the Ohio River flood of 1937. The village&#x27;s population was moved several miles inland to New Shawneetown.
==History==
At least one record suggests that a village was established here by the Pekowi Shawnee led by Peter Chartier about 1758. In early November 1803, Lewis and Clark are believed to have stopped at Old Shawneetown on their way to Fort Massac, just down the Ohio River.

After the American Revolution, Shawneetown served as an important United States government administrative center for the Northwest Territory. Shawneetown and Washington, D.C., share the distinction of being the only towns chartered by the United States government.

Old Shawneetown is the site of the first bank chartered in Illinois, in 1816. Originally in a log cabin, it was replaced in 1822 with a brick structure (only the second one in the town) now known as the John Marshall House.

Local legend states that the Shawneetown Bank refused to buy the first bonds issued by the city of Chicago on the grounds that no city located that far from a navigable river could survive.

Another historic bank building, the Bank of Illinois, was constructed in 1839-41 to house the offices of the Bank of Illinois at Shawneetown. It later housed numerous other financial institutions before it was closed in the 1930s. This fine example of Greek Revival architecture survives as the Shawneetown Bank State Historic Site.

Residents long remembered the visit by Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette of France to the city on May 8, 1825, as a high point for the early community&#x27;s social history.

After the Great Flood of 1937, many residents moved to the current location of Shawneetown. The old courthouse was torn down and a new Gallatin County Courthouse was constructed in 1939.

==Geography==
Old Shawneetown is located in southeastern Gallatin County at (37.698197, -88.136857), on the northwest bank of the Ohio River. Illinois Route 13 passes through the village. To the east it crosses the Shawneetown Bridge over the Ohio, becoming Kentucky Route 56 and leading to Morganfield, Kentucky. To the west, IL 13 leads to Shawneetown, the Gallatin County seat, and to Harrisburg.

According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Old Shawneetown has a total area of , all land.

In 2019, Old Shawneetown was featured on PBS NewsHour in a segment on communities subjected to repeated flooding. Because of the town&#x27;s historically flood-prone location, it is prohibitively difficult to insure, and some researchers have recommended a total relocation of the remaining residents as a preventative policy.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census there were 113 people, 40 households, and 21 families residing in the village. The population density was . There were 65 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the village was 92.92% White, 1.77% from other races, and 5.31% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.77% of the population.

There were 40 households, out of which 32.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 17.50% were married couples living together, 15.00% had a female householder with no husband present.

Below the poverty line was 75% of those under the age of 18 and 8.3% of those age 65 or over.

==History==

(From the Illinois Valley Cultural Heritage Association website) William Shelton, a ranger from Ft. Russell, Edwardsville, chose the alcove at the mouth of Hurricane Creek (creek at Eldred also called Hurricane), in 1826, to build a cabin. He left no record except Shelton&#x27;s Hill, Shelton’s Spring, and Shelton’s Graveyard. A back water lake bore the name of another early settler, Bucks Lake, for Joseph Buck, 1825. Another family name is Bishop’s Dell for James Bishop, 1830. The farm where Bishop&#x27;s Dell was located is bordered on the south by Trimley creek and the barn that James Bishop constructed using wooden pegs still stands as well as the foundation of his one-room stone home built against the bluff. Seely and Hodges built a mill on the creek in 1833. W. D. Wells came from North Carolina in 1834 and planted a small apple orchard on his farm. Later the McClay Orchard became famous for its varieties of apples and methods in orchard management. When the Chicago and Alton Railroad connected with the Kansas City branch at Roodhouse, Hillview was a lumber camp called Happy Ville. This is the same on the Illinois Atlas map of Greene County, 1876. In 1893 Hapeville was replaced by with Pegram P.O. and was locally reoffered to as both Hapeville and Pegram. The village of Hillview was incorporated in 1903. It still remains the route of the Illinois Central Gulf West.

==Indian history ==

In the 1980s, the Kampsville Archeological Center, located in Kampsville, Illinois, dug in the sand ridge area west of Hillview. Pottery, axes, grinding stones and arrowheads are not uncommon in this area, and it was theorized that the area was a factory for arrowheads at one time, without permanent settlement.

==History==
Braceville was founded under the name &quot;Sulphur Springs&quot; by Reverend L. S. Robbins in 1834. In 1848, after Robbin&#x27;s death, the town elected its first official supervisor, B. R. Dowd, who changed the name to Braceville after his home town of Braceville Township, Ohio. When coal was discovered in the region, residents became interested in the mining industry. However, no mines have ever been opened, and gradually, the town shifted its focus on other industries. The population has fluctuated over time, but is now growing at a steady rate.

==Geography==
According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Braceville has a total area of , of which (or 93.17%) is land and (or 6.83%) is water.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census there were 724 people, 288 households, and 202 families residing in the village. The population density was . There were 308 housing units at an average density of .

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.83% of the population.

There were 288 households, out of which 33.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 60.07% were married couples living together, 8.68% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.86% were non-families. 23.26% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.99% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.77 and the average family size was 3.08.

The village&#x27;s age distribution consisted of 37.2% under the age of 18, 4.5% from 18 to 24, 22.2% from 25 to 44, 22.6% from 45 to 64, and 13.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34.7 years. For every 100 females, there were 164.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 138.6 males.

About 9.9% of families and 9.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 9.4% of those under age 18 and 3.4% of those age 65 or over.

==Illinois Route 129 Bridge==
For many years, Route 66 (and later Route 129) crossed a railroad line and a creek via a bowstring arch bridge south of Braceville. Route 53 on the south side of the railroad line did not cross anything, so there was only one bridge on the northern highway. The two state highways traveled parallel to each other for several miles. In 1994 however, the arch bridge was closed off, and was removed in 2000.

<doc id="111233" wikidata="Q2672298" url="?curid=111233" title="Channahon, Illinois">
<text>Channahon ( ) is a village in Grundy and Will counties in the U.S. state of Illinois. The population was 13,383 at the 2020 census.

Located in a rural area southwest of Joliet, Illinois, Channahon lies at the confluence of the Des Plaines, Kankakee, and DuPage rivers, where they form the Illinois River. The Illinois and Michigan Canal runs through the village, intersecting the DuPage at Channahon State Park. Most of the village is within Channahon Township of Will County. The current village president is Missey Moorman Schumacher.

==History==
Archaeological evidence suggests that the land on which the village now stands was inhabited as long as three to four thousand years ago by Mound Builders. When white settlers arrived in the early 1830s, the region was populated by Potawatomi, with whom the early settlers had friendly relations. The settlers came to call the area &quot;Channahon,&quot; a Potawatomi phrase translated as &quot;meeting of the waters.&quot;

When construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal began in 1836, Channahon&#x27;s location was chosen as the site for two of the waterway&#x27;s locks. In 1845, Myrvin Benjamin plotted a new settlement to take advantage of the two rivers and the almost-completed canal surrounding the location. At first called &quot;Du Page,&quot; the settlement was officially named Channahon when the township government was organized in 1850. By the 1870s Channahon was home to a growing population and contained a post office, a schoolhouse, a Methodist church, two blacksmithies, and several stores. The community prospered until the rise of railroad transportation in the late 19th century caused commerce and population in the canal town to diminish. The Village of Channahon was first incorporated in 1896, but dissolved in 1908 to avoid liability after an automobile fell into the DuPage River due to a bridge failure. Becoming a mainly agricultural community after the decline of canal commerce, Channahon saw slow growth in the first half of the 20th century. 

On December 11, 1961 the area was reincorporated as the Village of Channahon. In the following decades, Channahon&#x27;s proximity to two major interstates, I-80 and I-55, resulted in the village&#x27;s rapid industrialization—notably including such facilities as a Mobil oil refinery, two petrochemical plants, a soybean oil production facility, CenterPoint Intermodal Center in neighboring Elwood, and numerous warehouses in both Elwood and Joliet, among which are Amazon and Walmart distribution centers. Experiencing significant residential and commercial development in response to its industrial economy, Channahon has since grown into an affluent semirural suburb of Chicago.

==Geography==
According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Channahon has a total area of , of which (or 92.50%) is land and (or 7.50%) is water. Channahon borders the neighboring communities of Minooka, Shorewood, Joliet, Elwood, Wilmington, and Morris.

==References in popular culture==

The little town of Coal City was mentioned in the classic comedy &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;. Elwood Blues (as played by Dan Aykroyd) explains that his brother Jake (John Belushi) was in prison for holding up a gas station, and then says &quot;He pulled that job to pay for the band&#x27;s room service tab from that Kiwanis gig in Coal City.&quot; For years residents of Coal City wondered if Aykroyd really said &quot;Coal City&quot; or said &quot;Cal City&quot; (a nickname for Calumet City, a much bigger city in Illinois). However, when watching the DVD of Blues Brothers with subtitles on, the text says &quot;Coal City.&quot;

The Steve Martin and John Candy comedy, &quot;Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles&quot;, was partially filmed in Coal City and other nearby towns.

<text>Dwight is a village located mainly in Livingston County, Illinois, with a small portion in Grundy County. The population was 4,032 at the 2020 census. Dwight contains an original stretch of U.S. Route 66, and from 1892 until 2016 continuously used a railroad station designed in 1891 by Henry Ives Cobb. Interstate 55 bypasses the village to the north and west.

==Geography==
Dwight is located in northeastern Livingston County. It extends north into southern Grundy County to include the commercial area near the northern exit with Interstate 55. I-55 leads northeast to Chicago and southwest to Bloomington. Illinois Route 17 passes through the center of Dwight as Mazon Avenue, leading east to Kankakee and west to Wenona. Illinois Route 47 (Union Street) passes through the east side of Dwight, leading north to Morris and south to Gibson City.

According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Dwight has a total area of , of which (or 99.70%) is land and (or 0.30%) is water.

===Climate===
==History==

===Founding===
Dwight was laid out on January 30, 1854, by Richard Price Morgan Jr. (1828-1910), James C. Spencer (1828 – after 1890), and John Lathrop (1809 – 1870). Each of these three men took a quarter of the land. All were working as engineers for the Chicago and Mississippi Railroad. The final quarter was jointly owned by two Bloomington brothers, Jesse W. Fell (1808 – 1878) and Kersey H. Fell (1815 – 1893). All five men had links to the railroad which was to open from Bloomington to Joliet in 1854.

Spencer was born in the Hudson River valley south of Albany; his ancestors included a United States Supreme Court Chief Justice and two governors of New York State; he was later to have an important career in Wisconsin railroads. Lathrop was a civil engineer with a long history of working with canals and railroads in New York; he would soon return to Buffalo. Morgan was the son of a noted civil engineer, and he later became nationally known for his work on electric railroads in New York. The Fell brothers were Bloomington land developers who had been active in helping found many central Illinois towns including Clinton, Normal, Pontiac, and Towanda. They were employed by the railroad as land agents; the Fells had a role in persuading Abraham Lincoln to write his autobiography.

The plan of the founders was to purchase a block of land along the route of the railroad, and to divide it into four equal parts. Morgan would then take charge of the operation. He would draw up a plan of the new town, sell the lots, and divide the proceeds among the others. The station was to be placed at the point where the four quarters met. Any unsold lots would be divided among the partners. The other men seemed to believe that Morgan was acting in the interest of the railroad. The town was named for Henry Dwight, who had funded most of the construction of this part of the railroad. The Chicago and Mississippi soon became the Chicago and Alton Railroad. Attempts in 1858 to rename the settlement &quot;Jersey&quot;, &quot;Beckman&quot;, or &quot;Dogtown&quot; failed.

===Early Dwight===
When the surveyors, working for the railroad&#x27;s chief engineer, Oliver H. Lee, reached the proposed location of the town in 1853, the speculators found that the tracks would pass slightly east of the planned central point and would go through lands in Morgan&#x27;s area. This would have made Morgan&#x27;s lots more valuable than the others. The men revised the plan so that everyone would convey their lots to Morgan, who would then sell the lots and split the total profits. This was done. In 1855 the partnership was dissolved and all unsold lots were divided among the five men. To announce to the public that a town would be located here, a tin pan was placed on top of a telegraph pole. Railroad workers flooded into the townsite. Morgan was afraid that they would cover lots with “Irish shanties” and make the lots unsellable. Therefore, he had John Campbell erect a boarding house. This was the first building in Dwight. The first house in town was built by Augustus West in June 1854. The first passenger train reached Dwight on July 4, 1854, and regular traffic on the railroad began in August of that year. The first store was a two-story building put up by David McWilliams in 1855 and painted white to attract customers. The first item sold was a pattern for a &quot;lawn dress&quot; that one of the workmen purchased for the wife of the station master. In 1857 John Spencer began buying grain and erected a grain warehouse. A grain elevator soon followed, and a large stone mill was built in 1859.

===Original design of Dwight===

Like most new towns founded in Illinois in the 1850s, Dwight was designed without a town square. It was centered instead on a depot ground. This was a widened area of railroad property, about long and wide, where the tracks passed through the town. Such depot grounds were common in towns of the 1850s and may still be found at Gridley, Chatsworth, Odell, Towanda, McLean and many other central Illinois places. By the 1870s depot grounds had begun to fall out of favor. Morgan had deeded the central band to the Chicago and Mississippi, but he never turned over the remainder of the depot grounds to the railroad. This led to a lawsuit which was settled by the United States Supreme Court. The suit provides information on the early history of Dwight. Dwight&#x27;s original town was quite large, consisting of 24 blocks, each of which contained 28 lots. Unlike Odell, where the entire original town was aligned with the railroad, only the small central part of the original town of Dwight paralleled the tracks, with West Street running diagonally on the northwest side of the railroad and East Street on the south side. In the remainder of the original town, streets ran true north-south or east-west. This created two odd triangles of land where these streets met the diagonal streets at the center of town. The southeastern triangle became the site of Dwight’s waterworks. The early depot was on the northwest side of the tracks.

===Prince Albert&#x27;s visit===

In 1860 Queen Victoria&#x27;s son Prince Albert, the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, came to stay several days in the town, which at the time was known as Dwight&#x27;s Station. The prince was traveling as Lord Renfrew, using one of his lesser titles, but this fooled no one. The visit was important enough that local people recorded the exact time the prince arrived: twenty-seven minutes after six in the afternoon on Saturday, September 22, 1860. He was to stay with James C. Spencer, one of Dwight&#x27;s founders, at Spencer&#x27;s farm south of town. Local couches and chairs were deemed insufficient for him, so Spencer&#x27;s furniture was stored, and the prince&#x27;s own furniture, which had been shipped ahead, was placed in the house.

Soon after the Crown Prince arrived he began hunting and over several days the royal party killed over 200 prairie chickens and quail. Prince Albert attended Sunday services at the local Presbyterian church. On Wednesday, September 26, he left, having planted an elm on Spencer&#x27;s farm. In 1878 the grounds of the house where the prince stayed were improved by the American landscape architect Ossian Cole Simonds and in the 21st century were given to the town and have become Renfrew Park.

===Growth of Dwight===

In 1869 the prospects of Dwight were improved when a second railroad line was constructed linking Dwight with Streator by the St Louis, Jacksonville and Chicago Railroad. In the same year the Chicago and Alton Railroad, successor to the Chicago and Mississippi Railroad, was double-tracked from Odell to Gardner.

The first brick house in Dwight was built in 1872.

In 1879 Dwight physician, Dr. Leslie Keeley, working with Richard Oughton, announced that he had found a cure for alcoholism based on gold chloride. The Keeley Institute soon became world-famous treating hundreds of thousands of patients including Elliott Roosevelt, the brother of President Theodore Roosevelt. Profits paid for the John R. Oughton House, on the south side of Dwight, which was constructed in 1891 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

in 1881, the Illinois, Indiana and Iowa Railroad was built east to west through the town from South Bend, Indiana, to Streator, giving it a second railroad station. This line later became part of the New York Central Railroad.

By 1891 it became clear that the growing town needed a new main-line railroad station, and the C&amp;A Railroad hired Henry Ives Cobb to design the building. The result was a splendid Richardsonian Romanesque edifice, which in 1982 was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Dwight Railroad Station. Another new downtown building now on the National Register was the Frank L. Smith Bank, opened in 1906, which was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.

In 1906, the Bloomington, Pontiac and Joliet Electric Railway opened to the town from Pontiac. This was intended as part of a fast electric passenger interurban service from Chicago to St. Louis, but no further construction was done.

In 1921 paving was finished on the Chicago to Springfield road, which in 1926 was designated as Route 66. The improvement of the road doomed the interurban railway, which shut down in 1925. In 1964 the first phase of Interstate 55 was completed, and Dwight became increasingly a highway-oriented town.

In 1930 the state of Illinois established the Oakdale Reformatory for Women, which later became the Dwight Correctional Center, west of the village.

===June 2010 tornado===
On June 5, 2010, an EF-3 tornado ripped through Streator and later Dwight. As described by one reporter who covered the disaster, the tornado &quot;literally rearranged these towns of Dwight and Streator, with the worst damage in mobile home parks and downtown Streator. The residents of Dwight are thankful for the fact that the tornado largely spared their town.&quot;

==Monuments==

Dwight is home to the First National Bank of Dwight, one of only three banks designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. A historic U.S. Route 66 Texaco gas station, Ambler&#x27;s Texaco Gas Station, and a 1891 railway station are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The 1857 Dwight Pioneer Gothic Church is a rare example of a wooden Carpenter Gothic church building. John R. Oughton House is also located in Dwight.

Dwight station, a train station designed in 1891 by Henry Ives Cobb, operated continuously from the spring of 1892 until October 2016 when a new station opened several blocks away. The original station is now the home of the Dwight Historical Society Museum and the Dwight Chamber of Commerce.

The Dwight Veterans&#x27; Administration Hospital occupied the triangular-shaped block between Main Street, Mazon Avenue, and Prairie Avenue. Part of the facility was built in 1891 for the Keeley Institute. In 1930 it became the Dwight V.A. Hospital, and an addition opened on May 11, 1947, with a modern surgical suite, wards, clinic, and physical therapy facilities. The buildings survive and are partially occupied by the Fox Developmental Center.

Sadie planned a trip to Dwight in the &quot;Sadie&#x27;s Trip to Dwight&quot; episode of the radio serial &quot;Vic and Sade&quot;, originally aired on June 4, 1937. The series, set in a vaguely fictionalized Bloomington, Illinois, often used towns near Bloomington in its scripts.

==Industries==
The Allen Paper Car Wheel Works were based on East North Street in Morris, which supplied the Pullman Palace Car Company in Chicago from 1867 to 1890 with composite wheels for their railway carriages. By the 1920s, the paper mill had become one of the largest employers in Morris, producing cardboard boxes of various shapes, sizes, and colors that were shipped throughout the US.

The Lyondell Chemical Company is located about from the city center. The plant, located just off U.S. Route 6 heading eastbound away from Morris, employs many Morris residents. In addition to the chemical plant, three nuclear power plants are located within a radius of the center of Morris. The closest nuclear plant is only away, called the Dresden Nuclear Power Station. The LaSalle Nuclear Station is away, and Braidwood Generating Station is about away. All of the stations are owned by Exelon Corp. Among the stations, Dresden Generating Station generates energy for Chicago and surrounding areas.

==Telephone switching history==
In early 1960, the world&#x27;s first electronic switching system was installed at the Morris central office. The system was a milestone in telephone switching history, an experiment whose planning started in the early 1950s, and led to the largest sustained research and development program toward a single goal in the Bell System. After conversion of the existing manual telephone system using telephone operators for completing telephone calls, with an automatic electromechanical crossbar switching system starting in ca. 1958, a few hundred subscribers received dial service from June 1960 through January 1962 from the first mostly electronic system, that used cold-cathode electron tubes, instead of mechanical relays and switches. For telephone subscribers, the most notable characteristic of what is usually called the &quot;Morris System&quot; was the use of electronic tone ringers which used up to eight different tones produced by a tweeter, rather than the traditional bell ringer.

<text>Seneca is a village in LaSalle and Grundy counties in the U.S. state of Illinois. The population was 2,353 at the 2020 census, down from 2,371 at the 2010 census.

The LaSalle County portion of Seneca is part of the Ottawa Micropolitan Statistical Area, while the small portion that lies in Grundy County is part of the Chicago–Naperville–Joliet Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

A French missionary by the name of Father Gabriel de la Ribourde brought Catholicism to the Seneca area 175 years before St. Patrick’s Parish was founded. In 1680, he was traveling with an exploratory party from Quebec when he was ambushed and killed by a band of Kickapoo Indians. A wooden cross marks the spot where Illinois’ first martyr to the Catholic faith is believed to have died (which is located next to St. Patricks Catholic Church).

Seneca was first settled by Jeremiah Crotty, an entrepreneur and contractor who helped build the Illinois and Michigan Canal. Crotty built the first residence in 1850 and established the town in 1854 with a post office in his name. Residents retained the name Crotty Town until 1957, when they incorporated the town as Seneca. Before 1957 Seneca was known as Crotty in paper but known locally as Seneca.

The village of Seneca, formerly named Crotty after its founder, Jeremiah Crotty, was incorporated in 1865. The town was created during the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal for which Crotty was a contractor.

The Rock Island Railroad and the Illinois River also supported the creation and business of our town. Seneca is most known for its contributions during World War II when Chicago Bridge and Iron operated the Prairie Shipyard. 157 Landing Ship, Tanks (LST) were built here.

Seneca High School houses students from Seneca as well as students from the nearby towns of Mazon, Verona, Kinsman, and Marseilles.

The 2005 Illinois State Board of Education&#x27;s 2005 Illinois District Report Card shows that the Seneca High School was strongly funded - in large part through payments made by Commonwealth Edison&#x27;s power generation plant located approximately ten miles south of Seneca. For example, the above cited 2005 high school district Report Card shows the Illinois State average instructional expenditure per pupil at $5,216, but Seneca was able to provide $8,647 in instructional expenditures per pupil. Similarly, while the state average operating expenditure per pupil was $8,786, Seneca was able to dedicate $17,305 per pupil, which is reflected in the grade school, middle school, and high school facilities. These payments made by Commonwealth Edison have since decreased along with the impact they once had.

<doc id="111245" wikidata="Q2669056" url="?curid=111245" title="South Wilmington, Illinois">
<text>South Wilmington is a village in Grundy County, Illinois, United States. The population was 710 at the 2020 census.

Although the name might indicate proximity to the city of Wilmington, South Wilmington is approximately 11 miles southwest of Wilmington, and is separated from it by several communities, including Gardner, Braceville, Godley, and Braidwood.

==History==
South Wilmington came into existence August 23, 1900.  The first election for village officers was held September 10, 1899, and the first set of officers elected were: Robert McXulty, St., president; Mike Finn, clerk; Walter Ferguson, treasurer; Charles McLean, constable; William Walker, street commissioner; Levi Simms, police magistrate, and William Purdy, Martin Ferrero. Patrick Corrigan, Hugh Young and John Hammer, trustees.

The family of Mr. Gibson Simpson were the first to locate at South Wilmington, moving into a house taken there from Braidwood that had belonged to Ed Blandey. The second family was that of Patrick Corrigan, who came to take charge of the hotel which was built by the C. W. and C. Coal Company, it being the first to be put in South Wilmington. In 1899 the coal company commenced to build new houses and sell them to their employees, and a great many were moved in from the surrounding towns of Braceville, Braidwood, Coal City, and Clarke City.

A meeting of the citizens was held in the fall of 1899 and donations were asked for the commencement of a school for the benefit of the few children here. School commenced that same fall, being held in an old store building which had been moved in on Third Avenue. Miss Carrie Peart was employed as the first teacher. The miners would pay a fee of twenty-five cents per week to operate the school and to pay Miss Carrie Peart.

The area around present-day Dahlgren was known in the 1860s as the Shelton Precinct in Hamilton County before townships were formally established. In 1869 surveyors for the St. Louis &amp; South-Eastern Rail Road (predecessor to the Louisville and Nashville Railroad) referred to the future town site as &quot;Little Prairie.&quot; Construction of the railroad commenced in 1870 and was completed through the area in late 1871. At that time railroad officials applied to establish a post office in the nascent town which was to be home to the local railroad section boss. After the name &quot;Cottonwood&quot; was rejected by the U. S. postmaster (having already been used in Illinois) the name &quot;Dahlgren&quot; was assigned and the post office commenced operation on December 11, 1871. The village was named for John A. Dahlgren (1809–1870), a U.S. naval officer prominent during the American Civil War. On March 29, 1872, the official founding date of the village, A. M. Sturman executed a Deed of Dedication whereby he ceded 1 square mile of land centered on present day Main and 3rd Streets to formally layout the town. All land titles in Dahlgren derive from this original Deed of Dedication which was itself based on the original surveys conducted pursuant to Northwest Ordinance of 1787. The original settlement of Dahlgren extended roughly from the railroad depot/Chestnut St. (originally &quot;A&quot; Street) south to Sturmman St (originally &quot;D&quot; Street) and from 1st St. west to 5th St., a total of 12 square blocks.

Since the digital television transition of 2009 there have been many ownership and affiliation changes in television markets. The Harrisburg, IL / Cape Girardeau, MO / Paducah, KY DMA has been no exception. In 2019 major players include Sinclair, Paxton Media Group, Raycom Media, Quincy Media, and the University of Southern Illinois. WPXS (Daystar), licensed to Mt. Vernon, moved its transmitter northwest of Breese, IL in the St. Louis, MO DMA and is no longer available over-the-air in Dahlgren. Viewers with a rotator and suitably elevated antenna can also receive virtually all over-the-air broadcasts from Evansville, Indiana.

Cable television service (analog), previously available from Longview Communication, was terminated in 2006. Hamilton County Communications (a wholly controlled subsidiary of the Hamilton County Telephone Cooperative - HCTC) acquired the cable-operating rights upon Longview&#x27;s demise and operated an IPTV-based television service under the Futiva brand until 2019 when HCC exited the business.

Mobile telephony services are provided by ATT (formerly Cingular) and Verizon. At one time 6 providers offered cellphone coverage, either directly or through roaming agreements. This included First Cellular of Southern Illinois (which HCTC co-owned) and T-Mobile.

Local landline telephone and DSL service is available through the Hamilton County Telephone Cooperative (and/or Hamilton County Communications). Wireless broadband service is provided by all mobile providers. Satellite broadband service is available from Exede/ViaSat and HughesNet.

== Government and schools ==

Dahlgren is governed by a non-partisan village president (mayor) and six-member non-partisan Board of Trustees, half of whom are elected to staggered four-year terms in odd-numbered years. Steve Wilkerson was re-elected village president in 2017. The village provides basic utility services including water, sewer, and gas and contracts on a fee-for-service basis with a third party for refuse removal.

Dahlgren is located within the Hamilton County Unit 10 school district. Elementary-age children attend Dahlgren Grade School through sixth grade. Junior high school and high school students travel to the county seat of McLeansboro, where a new combined school complex was completed in 2001.

<text>Carthage is a city in and the county seat of Hancock County, Illinois, United States. Its population was 2,490 as of the 2020 census. Carthage is best known for being the site of the 1844 murder of Joseph Smith, who founded the Latter Day Saint movement.

==History==
The first European-American settlers arrived in Carthage and in Hancock County in the first few decades of the 19th century. By 1833, they had erected simple buildings in Carthage. That year, a log cabin was built to serve as the county courthouse, and the county seat was moved from Montebello to Carthage. The town was platted in 1838.

The only person legally hanged in Hancock County, Efram Fraim, had been defended in his trial by roaming circuit attorney Abraham Lincoln. Fraim was found guilty of murder. Lincoln filed an appeal with the judge in the trial, which was as far as most appeals in those days went. Because Carthage then had no jail, Fraim was kept at the courthouse, which was next to the school. Fraim conversed with the children from his second-floor window. As a result of those conversations, most of the school children were present when their new friend, Efram, was hanged. The hanging is believed to have taken place near the current city sewer plant east of town, where a natural amphitheater allowed for a crowd to view the spectacle.

While they were incarcerated in the Carthage Jail in June 1844, Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, and his brother Hyrum Smith were killed by a mob on Thursday, June 27, 1844.

On October 22, 1858, Lincoln spoke in Carthage while he was campaigning for the US Senate. A large stone on the south side of the Courthouse Square commemorates the spot.

Over the years, the jail has been modified and used for different purposes. For a while, it was home to Carthage College. The jail has been restored to a close approximation of its appearance in 1844 and is now owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The site, a full city block, is a historical visitor center.

The regionally-noted botanist, philanthropist, and traveler Dr. Alice L. Kibbe called Carthage home. Along with her personal collections, Carthage&#x27;s Kibbe Hancock Heritage Museum houses a variety of exhibits celebrating local and regional history.

Carthage is the only city in Illinois to have all of the jails that it has ever used still in existence: the old jail, called the Mormon Jail; the jail next built, which was also the Sheriff&#x27;s residence, is on the south side of Courthouse Square; and the new jail, which is on Highway 136 in the city&#x27;s west side.

The Hancock County Courthouse in Carthage was built in 1908 and is the third courthouse for the county. It is at the center of the square in Carthage. The courthouse and the shops surrounding the square have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1986.

<text>Dallas City is a city in Hancock and Henderson counties in the U.S. state of Illinois. The population in 2020 stands at an estimate of 805, a decline from the 2010 census of 945, which was a decline from 1,055 in 2000.

The Hancock County portion of Dallas City is part of the Fort Madison–Keokuk, IA–IL–MO Micropolitan Statistical Area, and the Henderson County portion of Dallas City is part of the Burlington, IA–IL Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
According to historical records, a man named Israel Atherton purchased the land around present-day Dallas City in 1836. He built a log cabin but he didn&#x27;t seem to stay very long. He sold the land to John Finch, who built a village, which today is still recognized as, Dallas City. It was laid out in 1848, and named in honor of George Mifflin Dallas, 11th Vice President of the United States of America, from 1845 to 1849. A post office has been in operation at Dallas City since 1850.

== Abraham Lincoln Monument ==
On October 23, 1858, Abraham Lincoln stopped in Dallas City, Illinois to deliver a speech. Many local men were instrumental in persuading Lincoln to visit Dallas in 1858, including George M. Ames, H.F. Black, and Ben Mendenhall. According to the Dallas City Review newspaper, several efforts were made by Democrats to tear down the platform that had been erected for Lincoln to use during his speech. Republican forces, however, were present and did not allow it to happen. A monument to represent Lincoln&#x27;s visit sits on the Mississippi River on the Riverfront Park at the end of Oak St.

There was supposed to be two stones with bronze plaques, one for Lincoln&#x27;s visit, the other for President James Polk along with his Vice-President, George M Dallas. There is no information given as to why that other plaque was not included on the stone, but it is assumed Lincoln&#x27;s was more impactful.

The day before (October 22, 1858), Lincoln had spoken at the second courthouse made in Hancock County, the county Dallas City is a part of, to residents as he and Stephen A. Douglas were running against one another for the US Senate.

In 2008 the Nauvoo-Colusa district closed its high school and redirected students to Warsaw Community Unit School District 316&#x27;s Warsaw High School. Upon promoting from the eighth grade, students attend high school at Illini West in Carthage, Illinois.

<text>La Harpe is a town in Hancock County, Illinois, United States. The population was 1,175 at the 2020 census.

==History==
During the 18th century, French explorers headed by Bernard de la Harpe were forced to spend the winter just north of the present city of La Harpe. About 1896, four stone tablets dated June 15, 1715, and inscribed in French were reportedly found a few miles east of the old fortification built by the explorers. Stones were translated locally by the only French family in town as follows: &quot;We are surrounded by indians and have no hope for survival unless help soon arrives.&quot; Said stone tablets were reported to be sent to the Smithsonian for authentication, and were ruled a hoax. Their whereabouts are currently unknown.

Soon after 1830, landowners in the area began to develop a town which they called &quot;Franklin&quot;. In 1836, they applied for a post office and were informed another town in Illinois was already named Franklin. The first postmaster, Louis Rice Chaffin, suggested the name be registered as &quot;La Harpe&quot;, for the Frenchman who spent the winter over 100 years earlier. The City of La Harpe was granted a charter by the Illinois legislature in 1859. The charter was amended in 1861 to change the size of the town, and the boundaries have changed through the years. Today the city has 22 streets and avenues.

In 1867, the TP&amp;W railroad line was completed through the town. In 1888, the city council bought the first fire engine, but a fire in October 1893 still destroyed nearly all the businesses in one block of Main Street. City Hall was built in 1894. The election of 1895 was the first election in which the women of La Harpe were allowed to vote on the issue of liquor licenses. (The women had a separate ballot box.) The La Harpe Carnegie Public Library was built in 1905, with local support and a donation from Andrew Carnegie. Today it is listed on the National Register of Historic Sites. The City Park was donated by Marvin Tyron, one of the town&#x27;s founders, as a public square.

In 1986, La Harpe celebrated 150 years of history. During that year, a sesquicentennial history entitled &quot;La Harpe, Illinois, 1836-1986&quot; was published.

Each summer the town used to celebrate their Summerfest on the town square. The annual Fred Gibb Car Show is held in August. Gibb&#x27;s claim to fame was as the sponsor of the original ZL-1 COPO Camaros and Novas during the pony car era of the early 1970s. Gibb&#x27;s name has since been omitted from the car show.

Today, many of the surviving buildings in La Harpe&#x27;s business districts, including the City Hall, are on the National Register of Historic Places. La Harpe had the only four-story building in Hancock County. The park district includes a community clubhouse, swimming pool, the LaMoine Valley golf course, and a complex of lighted ball fields. The city park has a lighted shelter house and stage.

==Geography==
La Harpe is located in northeastern Hancock County at , south of the South Branch La Moine River. Illinois Route 9 passes through the city as its Main Street, leading east to Bushnell and west to Dallas City on the Mississippi River. Illinois Route 94 intersects IL 9 at the western edge of the city, and leads north to Stronghurst.

According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, La Harpe has a total area of , all land.

===Illini West High School===

* Home of the Chargers

In August 2007, La Harpe High School, as well as Dallas City and Carthage High Schools, were deactivated through the first school convergence to be approved by voters in the state of Illinois, with much regret. Former La Harpe students are now attending the newly formed Illini West High School in Carthage, Illinois.

===La Harpe Grade School/Jr. High===

The La Harpe Community School District #347 was formed with the dissolution of District #335. The former High School facility was renovated extensively.

La Harpe Elementary was recently named an Illinois Spotlight School. A Spotlight School is a high poverty school where academic performance is closing the &quot;achievement gap&quot;.

===La Harpe High School===

* Former home of the Eagles/Thunder/Cyclones

In 1996, the Northwestern-La Harpe Thunder football team was the first athletic team with La Harpe High School students to ever participate in the IHSA State Finals. They were defeated 35-28 by the Chenoa Redbirds. In 2000, the team once again made it to the IHSA State Finals and were defeated by the Carthage Blueboys 14–0.

In 1839, a log cabin was built to be used as a blacksmith shop. After a few years it became the first school house in La Harpe. The log cabin served as a school house until 1844, when it was sold and became a blacksmith shop again. The next school building was a brick building that had an enrollment of 98 students. This building served as a public school until the academy was built in 1857. The Academy was located on the present site of the elementary school building. A new building was built in 1898 for a larger student body. This building served as the high school and elementary school until it was destroyed by fire in 1927. A new structure was built in 1929. This building was in use until 2012 when it was dismantled in anticipation of grant funding for a new school from the State of Illinois, which never materialized. The school became La Harpe Community School District on April 20, 1942. In 1958, the current high school building was built. On May 2, 1961, the former La Harpe Community School District #335 was formed from the communities of Fountain Green, Terre Haute, La Harpe, and Durham. On May 27, 2007, the high school hosted its final graduation.

<text>Nauvoo ( ; from the ) is a small city in Hancock County, Illinois, United States, on the Mississippi River near Fort Madison, Iowa. The population of Nauvoo was 950 at the 2020 census. Nauvoo attracts visitors for its historic importance and its religious significance to members of several groups: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; the Community of Christ, formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (RLDS); other groups stemming from the Latter Day Saint movement; and the Icarians. The city and its immediate surrounding area are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Nauvoo Historic District.

==History==
The area of Nauvoo was first called Quashquema, named in honor of the Native American chief who headed a Sauk and Meskwaki settlement numbering nearly 500 lodges. By 1827, white settlers had built cabins in the area, and by 1829, it was sufficiently settled to warrant a post office. In 1832, the town, by then called Venus, was one of the contenders for the new county seat. However, the honor was awarded to a nearby city, Carthage. In 1834, the name Venus was changed to Commerce.

In late 1838, Apostle Brigham Young counseled Israel Barlow and 32 other Latter-day Saints to leave Far West, Missouri, to search for a place for more than 12,000 homeless Saints to find refuge. While journeying in exile, Barlow would separate from the group and eventually make the acquaintance of Dr. Isaac Galland, the owner of land near Montrose, Iowa, and Commerce, Illinois. After hearing of the dire plight of the Saints, Galland offered Barlow to sell the Saints the properties on good terms, an offer that Barlow relayed to Church leaders. The Church purchased the property from Galland in 1839 and the dispersed Saints once again began to gather together, particularly along the Mississippi River at Commerce.

In April 1840 Commerce was renamed Nauvoo by Joseph Smith, who led the Latter-day Saints there to escape conflict with the state government in Missouri. The name Nauvoo is derived from the traditional Hebrew language with an anglicized spelling. The word comes from Isaiah 52:7, &quot;How beautiful upon the mountains...&quot; By 1844 &quot;Nauvoo&#x27;s population had swollen to 12,000, rivaling the size of Chicago&quot; at the time.
John C. Bennett, Smith&#x27;s Assistant President and first commander of the Nauvoo Legion, was elected mayor of Nauvoo in 1841. He was replaced by Smith himself in 1842. After Smith&#x27;s death two years later, continued violence from surrounding non-LDS members forced most Latter-day Saints to leave Nauvoo. Most of these followers, led by Brigham Young, emigrated to the Great Salt Lake Valley. In 1849, Icarians moved to the Nauvoo area to implement a utopian socialist commune based on the ideals of French philosopher Étienne Cabet. The colony had nearly 500 members at its peak, but Cabet&#x27;s death in 1856 led some members to leave this parent colony.

After the departure of the Icarians, Nauvoo became the largest German-speaking community in Illinois and remained so for fifty years. German was spoken widely in town and in the Catholic, Lutheran, Presbyterian, and Methodist churches. During this period, wine-making and fruit production thrived in Nauvoo. Notable residents from this era included the Swiss memoirist Heinrich Lienhard. During World War I, most of Nauvoo&#x27;s native-German speaking residents stopped using German in public, and the use of German had entirely faded away by World War II.

==Nauvoo today==
On the city&#x27;s higher ground are the temple, residential areas, and the business district along Mulholland Street (Illinois Route 96), much of it devoted to the needs of tourists and those interested in Latter-day Saint history. The flatlands are occupied by a small number of 19th-century brick houses and other buildings that have survived the city&#x27;s vicissitudes, with large empty spaces between them where houses and whole neighborhoods have disappeared.

The Community of Christ previously owned much of the southern end of the flatlands as well as several key historic sites in and around Nauvoo, including the Joseph Smith Homestead, the Nauvoo House, the Red Brick Store, the Mansion House, and the Smith Family Cemetery. On March 5, 2024, it was announced that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had acquired all of these properties with the exception of the Smith Family Cemetery as part of a larger transfer of historically significant properties and artifacts from the Community of Christ.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also owns most of the other historic sites in Nauvoo, including the homes of Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and other early members of the church, as well as other significant buildings. Most of these sites are open to the public, with demonstrations and displays, and there are self-guided driving tours as well as wagon tours. These tours are free, as are the stage and riverside theatrical productions. There is a large visitors&#x27; center complete with two theaters and a relief map of 1846 Nauvoo.
The creation of Nauvoo as a historical tourism destination was largely a result of the work of J. LeRoy Kimball (1901–1992). Kimball was a descendant of early LDS leader Heber C. Kimball, and bought his ancestor&#x27;s home in 1954 with the intention of restoring it. He was the president of Nauvoo Restoration, Inc. from 1962 to 1986.

A Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints congregation was established in Nauvoo in 1956, from its inception consisting largely of elderly LDS couples serving as missionaries and historical guides. The &quot;City of Joseph&quot; pageant, an outdoor musical produced by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, began to run each summer in 1976. A stake was organized with headquarters at Nauvoo in 1979. In addition to the many homes that had been restored, the Relief Society Memorial Garden was dedicated in 1978, featuring statues designed by Dennis Smith and Florence Hansen.

In June 2002, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints completed construction of a new temple on the site of the original temple. The exterior, and much of the interior, is a copy of the original. The exterior matches the original exactly except in three ways: The temple was positioned south to allow for parking on the north side, there are two new exterior doors (with an entrance on the north for disabled persons and emergency exits in the basement on the east) and there is a standing Angel Moroni as is seen on most modern temples; the original was an unspecified flying angel, also with a horn in hand but in a horizontal position with the compass, square and flame above.

The rebuilding of the Nauvoo Temple was an occasion of great joy and enthusiasm for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. During the public open house prior to its dedication, 331,849 visitors toured the building. Following 
Church custom, the temple is now used only by Church members.
The work to renovate various sites of historical significance in the area is coordinated by &quot;Nauvoo Restoration, Incorporated&quot;. NRI is a nonprofit organization supported by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Community of Christ, as well as others interested in Nauvoo&#x27;s history. Due to the work of NRI and its members, Nauvoo has been dubbed the &quot;Williamsburg of the Midwest.&quot; In March 2007, Nauvoo was nominated to compete as one of the Seven Wonders of Illinois.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints sponsors numerous activities throughout the year in Nauvoo including The Nauvoo Pageant (July/August). The 2020 pageant was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The community sponsors the Grape Festival (Labor Day weekend) and Pumpkin Walk (October).

Because most of the city is well above flood level, Nauvoo has not historically had problems when the Mississippi River has risen. In both the floods of 1993 and 2008, very little damage was sustained within city limits. Topography maps show a unique feature of Nauvoo with main street starting at the edge of the Mississippi River on the south side of town and ending at the Mississippi River&#x27;s edge on the north.

Nauvoo has many places of worship, among them: United Methodist Church, St Peter &amp; Paul Catholic Church, Cornerstone of Zion Church, Living Hope Church (non-denominational), a Community of Christ (formerly known as The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), and three wards of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

The Nauvoo Blue Cheese company began to produce cheese in the 1930s. It was discovered the cool, moist wine cellars in the area were ideal for aging cheese. The wine cellars, and the wine-making business originally started by the Icarians, saw a decline in use because of prohibition. In 2003 the Nauvoo Cheese company went out of business when Saputo food company purchased it and relocated to other facilities.

Nauvoo is also home to Baxter&#x27;s Vineyards, a small family-owned winery begun in 1857 by Emile Baxter that is Illinois&#x27; oldest established winery.

Tourism is the major industry in Nauvoo, with Nauvoo Restoration Inc., employing approximately 30, while an estimated 200 missionaries (unpaid) from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints also provide a boost to local businesses during the tourist season.

Additionally, there are appointed positions for city treasurer, chief of police, and public works positions.

Separate from the city are the Nauvoo Fire Protection District (FPD) and Nauvoo-Colusa School System. The Nauvoo FPD covers all of the city plus the surrounding five townships. The fire department currently provides both fire and EMS coverage for its district. In 1991 the Nauvoo FPD became a BLS non-transporting agency, relying on the county ambulance service to transport patients to local hospitals. Because of longer response times from county-run ambulances, the citizens of the Nauvoo FPD passed a referendum by 74% on April 17, 2007, for ambulance services that would transfer the ambulance tax money to the FPD that was being paid to the county. The Nauvoo FPD completed its fundraising efforts on November 30, 2007, to purchase its ambulance, which entered service in January 2008.

<text>Warsaw is a city in Hancock County, Illinois, United States. The population was 1,510 at the 2020 census, a decline from 1,607 in 2010. The city is notable for its historic downtown.

==History==
The city of Warsaw began in 1814, when young Major Zachary Taylor founded Fort Johnson on the eastern bank of the Mississippi River across from the mouth of the Des Moines River. Fort Johnson was occupied only for a few weeks before it was burned. In 1815 another military camp, Fort Edwards, was built nearby at a different location. Warsaw became an important fur trading post and one of the earliest American settlements in northern Illinois.

During the 1840s, Warsaw was a center of opposition to Mormon settlement in Nauvoo and other areas in Hancock County during the conflict sometimes known as the &quot;Mormon Illinois War&quot;. The local newspaper at the time, the &quot;Warsaw Signal&quot; edited by Thomas C. Sharp, was a vocal opponent of Mormon settlement and practices in western Illinois. The Mormons, led by Willard Richards, attempted to establish a settlement at a site just south of Warsaw during this period, but abandoned these plans due to local opposition and other problems.

The city is notable for its well-preserved downtown with a number of remaining historic businesses. Founded by German immigrants, the Warsaw Brewery opened in 1861 and operated for more than 100 years, ending production in 1971. The facility was renovated and reopened in 2006 as a bar and restaurant.

==The Cave==

Cave-in-Rock&#x27;s primary feature is a striking riverside cave formed by wind and water erosion and by cataclysmic effects of the 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes. The cave is located at , just upriver (east) from the village. The first European to come across it was M. de Lery of France, who found it in 1739 and called it &quot;caverne dans Le Roc&quot;. Other names for the cave include Rock-In-Cave, Rocking Cave, Rock-and-Cave, House of Nature, The Cave, Big Cave, and Murrell&#x27;s Cave. The cave is the main feature of Illinois&#x27; Cave-in-Rock State Park, established in 1929.

==History==
From the 1790s to the 1870s, the area around Cave-in-Rock was plagued by what historians as early as the 1830s referred to as the &quot;Ancient Colony of Horse-Thieves, Counterfeiters and Robbers&quot;, and better known today due to Otto Rothert&#x27;s history early in the 20th century as the &quot;Outlaws of Cave-in-Rock&quot;.

In 1790, counterfeiters Philip Alston and John Duff (or John McElduff) used the cave as some type of rendezvous, though details are scarce. Although folklore printed in 19th century histories failed to establish a prior connection between the two men, both had lived in the area of Natchez, Mississippi, at the start of the Revolutionary War.

Duff was living upriver a few miles, either at Battery Rock or across the Ohio River at what would become Caseyville, Kentucky, when in 1797 Samuel Mason moved his base of operations from Diamond Island and Red Banks to the cave and made it the home of river pirates. Two of Mason&#x27;s brothers had been business partners of Duff in Kaskaskia, Illinois, in the 1780s. Mason created a combination tavern, gambling den, brothel, and criminal refuge. His men lured in gullible river travelers and then robbed and killed them.

James Wilson, also known as Bully Wilson, may actually have been an alias for Samuel Mason, the next leader of the gang after Mason&#x27;s hasty departure, or possibly the front man for Mason&#x27;s operation. He may be the Wilson who married one of Mason&#x27;s nieces. In 1799, he hung a sign over the cave&#x27;s entrance saying &quot;Wilson&#x27;s Liquor Vault and House for Entertainment&quot;.

By this time, Duff and his associates had been making salt (or looking for silver) in the area around the Illinois Salines along the Saline River in southeastern Illinois. A detachment from the U.S. Army garrison at Fort Massac, down river from Cave-In-Rock, captured him and three of his men, Blakely, Hazle and Hall. The soldiers took their prisoners by boat down the Saline River to the Ohio River, intending to return to the fort. Old histories do not explain why they stopped at the cave. Subsequent events suggest it took place during the spring of 1799, when Wilson was in business, making it a stop for entertainment. Duff and his men escaped and overpowered the soldiers. They tied them up, put them in a boat, and pushed it into the river to float downstream to the fort. On June 4, 1799, the commandant of Fort Massac, Captain Zebulon Pike Sr., father of the future explorer of Pikes Peak, hired a French Canadian coureur de bois and three Shawnee warriors to assassinate Duff, which they did.

The infamous Harpe brothers also reached the cave region in the spring of 1799. They are associated with two separate stories at the cave and one at the infamous Potts Spring area to the north. The first story has them pushing a young couple off the top of the cliff above the cave. They survived. The second was an act of piracy in which only one man survived. Later, he was forced off the cliff as well, this time involving the man being tied down to a horse. Neither survived. The Potts Spring story is recalled as a murder of two or three hunters. This Harpe murder site within twenty years would become the future location of the legendary Potts Inn, which was presumed to be a human death trap for unsuspecting travelers along the Ford&#x27;s Ferry High Water Road, an early frontier highway, who wanted to spend the night for food and lodging.

Mason and Wilson&#x27;s time at the cave may have come to an end during the summer of 1799, when they were attacked by a group of bounty hunters/vigilantes under the leadership of Captain Young calling themselves &quot;The Exterminators&quot;. No contemporary accounts attest to river pirates occupying the cave in the first decade of the 19th century. The Harpes retreated back into Kentucky, while Mason traveled downriver and began to focus on highway robbery along the Natchez Trace.

The next generation of outlaws in the region sprang either from the Sturdivant Gang, a group of counterfeiters based at Sturdivant Fort, on top of the bluffs overlooking the Ohio River at what is now Rosiclare, Illinois; or the Ford&#x27;s Ferry Gang led by James Ford, based a few miles upriver from the cave at what became known as Ford&#x27;s Ferry, Kentucky. Law enforcement officials led three raids against Sturdivant Fort in 1822 and 1823. Although it is not clear what happened following the raids, the gang had disappeared from the area by 1830. The Ford&#x27;s Ferry Gang was broken up following the mysterious deaths or murders of James Ford&#x27;s two sons, followed by his own assassination in 1833.

Even after the death of Ford, outlaws remained. Isaiah L. Potts operated Potts Inn on the Ford&#x27;s Ferry High Water Road in Illinois north of the cave. Travelers checked in, but sometimes failed to check out. This presumed frontier hotel was very similar to the Bloody Benders&#x27; Wayside Inn, which appeared fifty years later in Labette County, Kansas. The legend of Billy Potts, the returning son who was murdered unknowingly by his father, likely took place in the months following Ford&#x27;s assassination. This tragic story of poetic justice has taken on folklorish proportions. Records show the elder Potts and his wife separated in 1834 or 1835.

Eson Bigsby (the first name sometimes spelled &quot;Eason&quot; or &quot;Enos&quot; and the last name sometimes spelled &quot;Bixby&quot;) took up counterfeiting in Hardin County in the decades following the Sturdivants. His attack on his wife Anna in an effort to find out where her first husband&#x27;s money was buried dates to the early 1860s and led to the legends of Anna Bixby, her treasure and her ghost. She survived running off a cliff in the dark. She is the namesake of the Anna Bixby Women&#x27;s Center in nearby Harrisburg, Illinois.

Although not completely connected to the &quot;Ancient Colony&quot;, Logan Belt and the Logan Belt Gang terrorized Hardin County in the 1870s and 1880s, until Belt was assassinated.
In the middle of the 1800s, church services were being held in the cave. This earliest Christian congregation eventually formed the Big Creek Baptist Church. Founded in 1807, it was the first church organized in southeastern Illinois. Cave-In-Rock incorporated in 1839, in the same year that Hardin County was created from a section of Pope County.

According to the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, &quot;in 1929, the State of Illinois acquired for a park that since has increased to . The well-wooded, hills and the rugged bluffs along the river—commanding expansive views of the famous waterway—became Cave-In-Rock State Park&quot;.

==In popular culture==
In Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Davy Crockett and the River Pirates&quot;, Davy Crockett and Mike Fink anachronistically fight Sam Mason and his pirates. Also, at Walt Disney World&#x27;s Magic Kingdom, there is a scene called &quot;Cut-Throat Corner&quot; and &quot;Wilson&#x27;s Cave Inn&quot; that can be seen on the bank of the Rivers of America while riding the &quot;Liberty Belle&quot; Riverboat around Tom Sawyer&#x27;s Island. This scene is based upon the real life Cave-In-Rock and the activity of river pirates during that time period.

A scene of the MGM classic &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; was filmed at the cave as well as at Battery Rock. In 1997, The History Channel show &quot;In Search of History&quot; filmed at the site for an episode entitled &quot;River Pirates&quot;.

The &quot;ninth book&quot; of Christopher Ward&#x27;s 1932 novel &quot;The Strange Adventures of Jonathan Drew; A Rolling Stone&quot; is titled &quot;Cave-In-Rock&quot;. The action is set in 1824. Jonathan rescues two slaves duped into running away and working for a gang of dangerous outlaws who use Cave-In-Rock as their base of operations.

The Gathering of the Juggalos was held in Cave-In-Rock from 2007 to 2013.

The multi-day heavy metal festival Full Terror Assault (FTA Open Air) takes place once a year at the Hogrock Ranch and Campground.

L. A. Meyer&#x27;s novel &quot;Mississippi Jack&quot; features the heroine leading an anachronistic raid against river pirates as an homage to the aforementioned Davy Crockett episode.

In 2009, artist Greg Stimac photographed Cave-In-Rock&#x27;s cave for his series of outlaw hideouts. In 2013, his photograph &quot;Ancient Colony of Horse-Thieves, Counterfeiters and Robbers&quot; was included in &quot;The Seven Borders&quot;, an exhibition curated by Joey Yates at the Kentucky Museum of Art and Craft.

About 10.3% of families and 12.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 15.5% of those under age 18 and 4.1% of those age 65 or over.

==History==
The Sauk and Meskwaki peoples once thrived on flatlands that gently fold into the Mississippi River. They called the area Oquawkiek, meaning “yellow banks.” White settlers arrived and kept the peace, thanks to Stephen S. Phelps, the founder of the village of Oquawka, who harbored respect for the native peoples. Phelps would befriend Abraham Lincoln, who was said to spend a lot of time visiting Oquawka. Here, long before his presidency, Lincoln supposedly met Jefferson Davis, then a faithful officer with the U.S. Army. And in 1858, Lincoln made a stump speech here, as did his rival and another Phelps family friend, Stephen Douglas, the first circuit judge in this seat of Henderson County.

That period saw the peak of commerce in Oquawka, as a mill and shipping concern. Civic leaders saw great promise for growth, but — in a familiar story from the 19th century — that went to the wayside when railroads went elsewhere. Still, Oquawka survives well as a village, with 1,539 residents and a half-shuttered downtown that supports locals as well as visiting boaters. In fact, east-west Illinois Route 164 stops in — not at, but in — the river, where the pavement slopes into the waterway to accommodate boat trailers.

===Norma Jean===
On July 17, 1972, the circus was in town. The main attraction of the Clark &amp; Walter Circus was a 29-year-old elephant named Norma Jean. History records little of her background, except that she was born in the U.S. She was an Asian elephant, which have smaller ears and bodies than the African variety, and weighed .

As nightfall approached, head elephant caretaker &quot;Possum Red&quot; tethered Norma Jean to a tree at the village park in the center of town, using a metal chain to hook her up. Not long after, in rolled storm clouds. A bolt of lightning ripped through the sky and found Norma Jean’s tree — the only one in the park. The voltage fired through the tree, along the metal chain, and into Norma Jean. Possum Red, who was still on the scene, was thrown by the electrical blast. Norma Jean thudded to the ground, lifeless. Possum Red and the rest of the circus scurried out of town. The following year, without its lone elephant — uninsured and worth the then-princely sum of $10,000 — the circus folded.

Townsfolk used a backhoe to dig a hole, rolled the three-ton-plus pachyderm corpse into the grave and marked it with a plywood sign. After town druggist Wade Meloan had raised enough money to erect a memorial, he and a mason friend rounded up two tons of rock and cemented together a tall wall stretching over the grave. Atop the monument, they secured a concrete elephant statue and ringed the wall with flowers. They affixed a glass case to the wall with newspaper accounts about Norma Jean. The plaque on the wall proclaims:

When they finished they invited hundreds of well-wishers to the dedication. They even rented a baby elephant to carry a wreath in its trunk to lay at the marker. Meloan became something of a sideshow barker for Norma Jean. He printed professional postcards of the memorial, selling them in Oquawka and beyond to drum up tourism. When reporters came calling, he’d gush over the lore of Norma Jean.

John Behnke, a graduate student from Southern Illinois University&#x27;s cinema program, filmed a 15-minute documentary on the marker, which later appeared on Showtime. By the mid-1990s, the site averaged two visitors a day. Tourism would get a boost when Oquawka would host a yearly fest to honor Norma Jean, with an elephant walk, white elephant sale and a bake sale featuring elephant ears.

Meloan, Norma Jean’s biggest supporter, died in 2004. Norma Jean has gone from a headline to a footnote. Hardly anyone ever stops by the grave anymore. A few years ago, unknown vandals destroyed the original elephant atop the memorial. The village got a replacement, but locals otherwise no longer pay much notice to the grave.

===1993 Flood===
During the month of July, The Flood of 1993 turned Oquawka into an island. There was no getting in, and no getting out. Oquawka, which sits above the Mississippi, for the most part stayed dry. The roads didn’t. Due to flash flooding of all the creeks, the town was cut off from the outside world for at least a day and a half.

===2008 Flood===
On the early morning of June 14, the town of Oquawka, Illinois, was evacuated, due to a levee breach along the swollen Iowa River. The city council believed this would affect the flood waters in the already flooding Mississippi River. The same day, two levees broke near the town of Keithsburg, Illinois, flooding the entire town.

It was located at the junction between two lines of the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad, and a since-razed depot was located at the junction. The north-south branch between Galesburg and Savanna crossed an east-west branch between Galva and New Boston. The east-west line has been abandoned and the north-south line is in operation as the BNSF Barstow Subdivision. The village was named Alpha (the first letter of the Greek alphabet), because Calkins believed it to be the beginnings of a great city. It was incorporated on January 11, 1895. In the early 1980s, director Barry Levinson looked at Alpha&#x27;s railroad car diner as a possible location for filming scenes for his 1982 film &quot;Diner.&quot;

==History==
Daniel Morton came to the area in 1846 and built the first log cabin. Gilbert Morton was the first child born here that year to Daniel and his wife Sarah. The following year a schoolhouse was built on the Morton property. The land the Mortons found was a swampy marsh to the north with higher ground to the south. Mud Creek meandered through the area and Green River paralleled the current Interstate 80 to the north.

In 1850, a survey of the right-of-way for the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad was made through Henry County. The selected route passed through the area inhabited by the Mortons and a few fellow pioneer families. In 1853, when the railroad was almost complete, Charles Atkinson and James Grant, owners of the land adjoining the railroad, plotted the town of Annawan. The town of Annawan, which some say was named after a Winnebago Indian Chief, was born.

At the turn of the twentieth century, a new channel of Green River was developed, drainage ditches were completed and tile installed. This allowed the marsh north of Annawan to become productive farmland.

With the completion of Interstate 80 through Henry County in the 1960s, Annawan began to grow at a steady pace, with various services such as restaurants and gas stations appearing along the interstate. By the dawn of the 21st century, several projects were planned in Annawan. The North Meadow subdivision was completed in the early 2000s as a community for retirees with a community center at the center of the development. A new interstate side hotel was also completed just off Canal Street adjacent to Interstate 80. Midway through the decade plans for an ethanol plant were made.

== Present day ==
Today, Annawan supports a variety of different businesses that serve Henry County and Interstate 80 travelers. As of 2013, the North Meadow retirement community development has been discontinued; however, the subdivision remains one of the newer housing developments in town. The library and the town offices have made their home in the former North Meadow community center. The aforementioned ethanol plant, Patriot Renewable Fuels, opened in 2007, providing Annawan with around 100 jobs. Annawan supports one hotel, three gas stations, five restaurants/taverns, a grocery store, and a gift shop, to name a few different services available in the community.

From 2000 to 2012, retail sales in Annawan have increased 123%. In addition, 48 businesses were open in Annawan in 2009, while 66 operate in the town today. On November 27, 2013, ground was broken for a new 5 million gallon biodiesel plant to be built adjacent to the existing ethanol plant in eastern Annawan.

It also has a camper store and a campground. Annawan is also home to Howes Park, which hosts the Annawan-Wethersfield Titans baseball team. The park also offers Youth soccer, Grades K through 5. About a mile west of Annawan is Mud Creek, which serves as the midpoint for the Carol M. Guthrie 5 Kilometer (3.5 mi) run.

== Rolle Bolle ==

Annawan&#x27;s Rolle Bolle courts are located in Howe&#x27;s Park, the location of the annual Rolle Bolle World Tournament, which is typically held in July. The yard game originated in Belgium (where it is known as &quot;krulbollen&quot;) and was brought over by Belgian immigrants to the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century. The game is also played in the nearby towns of Moline, Atkinson, Manlius, Geneseo, Kewanee, and Hooppole.

== Municipality type dispute ==
Annawan claims to be a village; however, per the Illinois Secretary of State, which has the duty of keeping track of incorporated municipalities in Illinois, Annawan is an incorporated town, not a village.

==History==

===Eric Jansson===

The village was founded in 1846 by Swedish immigrants affiliated with the Pietist movement, led by Eric Jansson. Prior to founding the Bishop Hill Colony, Jansson preached to his followers in Sweden about what he considered to be the abominations of the Lutheran Church and emphasized the doctrine that the faithful were without sin. As Jansson&#x27;s ideas became more radical, he began to lose support from many of his sympathizers and was forced to leave Sweden in the midst of growing persecution. Jansson had previously sent Olof Olsson, a trusted follower, as an emissary to the United States to find a suitable location where the Janssonists could set up a utopian community centered on their religious beliefs. According to Jansson, this community would become the &quot;New Jerusalem&quot;, and their beliefs would soon spread across the world. As a result, 1400 colonists emigrated from Sweden to their new home in western Illinois.

The colony struggled early on after its founding. Many of the first 1000 colonists died from disease on the way to Bishop Hill (named for Eric Jansson&#x27;s birthplace, Biskopskulla), while others became disillusioned and stayed in New York. The quarters in Bishop Hill were cold and crowded and food was scarce. After the first winter, life at the colony began to improve. In the next few years housing was upgraded from dugouts to brick living areas, and crops were planted on of land. By 1849, Bishop Hill had constructed a flour mill, two sawmills, a three-story frame church, and various other buildings. The Bishop Hill colony was communistic in nature, as dictated by Jansson. Thus, everything was owned by everyone and no one had more possessions than another. Work in the colony was highly rigorous and regimented. It wasn&#x27;t uncommon to see hundreds of people working together in the fields or large groups of laborers engaged in other tasks.

===After Jansson and today===

The Bishop Hill colony underwent a major upheaval in 1850 after the murder of Eric Jansson. Jansson was assassinated by a former colony member, John Root, who was upset with Jansson for interfering with his marriage to one of Jansson&#x27;s cousins. After their leader&#x27;s death, the people of Bishop Hill appointed a group of seven trustees to run the affairs of the colony. Among the trustees were Jonas Olsson and Olof Johnson, who would become the primary leaders of the colony as they had been two of Jansson&#x27;s closest aides. Under these two men and the rest of the trustees, the colony continued to grow and flourish. The workforce was reorganized to become more efficient and more buildings were erected. However, despite Bishop Hill&#x27;s success, in 1857 financial problems arose in the midst of accusations of mismanagement against Olof Johnson. Johnson had made several large investments, without colony approval, that had turned out to be disastrous. As Bishop Hill headed for financial ruin, colonists voted to end the communal system. In 1861 the formal dissolution of the colony was official, and many of its people would soon be forced to move away.
The Janssonist emigrants were a significant group of men and women to move from Sweden to the United States. Letters home from Janssonists to their friends and family, telling of the fertile agricultural land in the interior of North America, stimulated substantial migration for several decades and contributed to the formation of the Swedish-American ethnic community of the American Midwest.

Descendants of Eric Jansson still lived in the colony until December 20, 2004, when Eric&#x27;s great-great-grandson and Bishop Hill volunteer fireman Theodore Arthur Myhre Sr. died south of the Colony while on a fire service call. Other known descendants remain in Illinois.

Surviving buildings built by the Janssonists are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Bishop Hill is interpreted as a living community of Swedish-American heritage. Due to state budget cuts the Bishop Hill State Historic Site was closed for nearly 5 months from December 1, 2008, to April 23, 2009.

<text>Cambridge is a village and the county seat of Henry County, Illinois, United States. The population was 2,086 at the 2020 census.

==History==
After European-American settlement in this area and before 1843, Rev. Ithamar Pillsbury owned a large plot of land that was later developed as the town of Cambridge. He was well known among the numerous Yankee settlers (migrants from New England and upstate New York, who were largely descended from the English colonists in New England) who were migrating to Henry County at that time. Reverend Pillsbury deeded a large portion of his land to the town council for use as a town plot. Lots were sold to incoming migrants and on June 9, 1843 (after some quarreling among the town founders about how to finance it) construction began on the town. 

They laid out roads, established post routes, and erected public buildings to attract new residents. The original settlers were almost entirely of New England origins or were Yankees from upstate New York, whose families had moved to that area in the period after the Revolutionary War. They were land hungry. 

As a result, Henry County was part of the Northern Tier, with its culture being closely aligned with that of upstate New York and early New England.

==Geography==
According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Cambridge has a total area of , of which (or 99.30%) is land and (or 0.70%) is water.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census there were 2,086 people, 795 households, and 576 families residing in the village. The population density was . There were 910 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the village was 93.48% White, 0.62% African American, 0.19% Native American, 0.29% Asian, 0.00% Pacific Islander, 0.34% from other races, and 5.08% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.44% of the population.

There were 795 households, out of which 36.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 59.12% were married couples living together, 9.18% had a female householder with no husband present, and 27.55% were non-families. 24.78% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.81% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.94 and the average family size was 2.58.

The village&#x27;s age distribution consisted of 20.7% under the age of 18, 9.9% from 18 to 24, 25.8% from 25 to 44, 27.3% from 45 to 64, and 16.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40.9 years. For every 100 females, there were 111.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 111.2 males.

The median income for a household in the village was $66,250, and the median income for a family was $75,982. Males had a median income of $43,000 versus $20,114 for females. The per capita income for the village was $28,932. About 4.5% of families and 4.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 6.0% of those under age 18 and 4.8% of those age 65 or over.

==Court House==
As the county seat of Henry County, Illinois, Cambridge hosts the county government. The Henry County Court House, designed by Thomas J. Tolan &amp; Son, Architects, of Fort Wayne, Indiana (1875–1878), is the key architectural landmark of the village. The courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.

== Schools ==
Cambridge has a single school district, School District #227, which includes a single elementary school, junior high (attached to the high school), and high school. The high school graduates around 50-60 students annually. As in many small towns, the cultural life of the community revolves around the arts and sports related to the school. The elementary school was selected as a 2006 Blue Ribbon School, part of the No Child Left Behind Act. It was one of 18 selected in Illinois.

== Links to Bishop Hill==
Historically, Cambridge has been linked to nearby Bishop Hill, Illinois. This latter community was founded in 1846 by a sect of Swedish immigrants led by their prophet, Erik Janson. They had broken with the established Lutheran Church of Sweden, which did not tolerate much dissent. But for several years, local Americans and their Swedish neighbors traded and lived in peace. 

In 1850, Erik Janson was murdered by a former follower in the court house in Cambridge. The historic record reveals some tension between the Swedes in Bishop Hill and the residents of Cambridge. Also, the concentration of Swedish immigrants here attracted more of their countrymen to the Henry County area. As the population grew, they sought religious leadership from the established Lutheran Church of Sweden, then an official branch of the Swedish government.

Before fleeing from Sweden, Erik Janson and his followers had a contentious break from the Lutheran Church. The Cambridge Lutheran church was established as an offshoot of Lars Paul Esbjörn&#x27;s Augustana Lutheran Church in nearby Andover, Illinois, and was in line with the established church. But religious-related 
tensions continued between the Augustana Lutherans (including Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois) and the people of Bishop Hill well into the late 20th century. (For more information on Cambridge&#x27;s relationship with Bishop Hill see Troy Swanson&#x27;s &quot;Those Crazy Swedes: Outside Influence on the Bishop Hill Colony&quot; in &quot;Nobler things to View: Collected Essays on the Erik-Janssonists&quot;, published by the Bishop Hill Heritage Association in 1998.)

<text>The village of Coal Valley is located in both Rock Island County and Henry County in the U.S. state of Illinois. The population was 3,873 at the time of the 2020 census, up from 3,743 at the 2010 census. It is mostly residential, housing families who work in or out of the greater Quad Cities Area and is considered a suburb. The students of the Rock Island County part of Coal Valley attend the Moline-Coal Valley School District, and in the Henry County portion, Orion Community Unit School District 223

Oakwood Country Club, located in Coal Valley, was host of the Hardee&#x27;s Golf Classic from 1986 through 1994. The tournament was later renamed to &quot;John Deere Classic&quot; once sponsorship was taken over by Deere &amp; Company. The tournament is now hosted at the TPC at Deere Run course in Silvis, Illinois.

==History==

The first settlers in Coal Valley were trappers and farmers who came from Wales, England, Ireland, Germany and Sweden. The pioneer settlers of the community are thought to have been William and Charles Bailey who built the first house within the present village limits. It is also believed that they operated a small mine, which could have been the first discovery of coal in the vicinity.

The Coal Valley Mining Company was formed in 1856. The men who incorporated the company were Holmes Hakes, Charles Buford, S. S. Guyer, Ben Harper and N. B. Buford. They gave the community its name. The booming years for coal mining in Coal Valley were from the 1850s to about the middle of the 1870s. Over the years other mining companies moved in. 1942 saw the end of coal mining in and around the community.

In March 1876, a vote was taken and passed to form the Village of Coal Valley. On April 22, 1876, the first Board of Trustees was made. On April 22, 1876, H. B. Sudlow was chosen president and Harvey Clark was appointed the first Constable.

In May 1892, a petition was signed by twenty-eight citizens of Coal Valley, asking that a town hall be erected. The lots needed for the building site were purchased from Gustave Krapp Sr. Mr. Johnson of Orion was contracted to erect the building. The hall was built identically to Orion&#x27;s town hall. Work began in September and by Thanksgiving the building was up. In January 1893, the hall was officially accepted. The total cost was under $3,000.

In April 1900, the Village Board purchased a fire engine and hose cart for the sum of $875. In November 1900, the Village Board purchased the land and built a one-story fire station.

In 1929, the construction of Highway 150 was completed through the Village, and in 1933, it was extended as far east as Orion.

In 1939, the Coal Valley High School was built at the cost of $70,000 and that fall forty-six pupils were enrolled. The first members to graduate from the new Coal Valley High School were Ruth Schroeder, Evelyn Martin, Mary Kepple, Florence Robinson, Raymond Johnson, Harlan Raub, Robert Anderson, Sydney Bradford and Francis Creger. The Coal Valley High School was dissolved in 1952 and used as the junior high, and high school students attended the new high school in Moline.

<text>Galva is a city in Henry County, Illinois, United States. The population was 2,470 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Cousins William L. Wiley (1820–1900) and James Wiley (1817–1886) founded Galva in 1854. The name Galva honors the Swedish immigrants of nearby Bishop Hill and refers to Gävle, Sweden which is the town&#x27;s sister city. Today around 80% of the town has Scandinavian ancestry.

Galva was a railroad town. Galva was laid out along the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (Burlington Route) with the help of Bishop Hill trustees who invested heavily in Galva. This was the first of three rail lines to locate there. This group was formed in 1852 and ran a line from Aurora, Illinois to Galesburg, Illinois. A second branch of the Burlington Route later also came through. Later the Peoria and Rock Island Railroad (Rock Island Railroad) came through Galva. Several Amtrak lines run through the town, including the California Zephyr and Southwest Chief, but none stop in Galva. A station is located 10 miles north in Kewanee for the Illinois Zephyr and Carl Sandburg, and 25 miles south in Galesburg for all trains.

<doc id="111288" wikidata="Q577536" url="?curid=111288" title="Geneseo, Illinois">
<text>Geneseo is a city in Henry County, Illinois, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 6,539. Geneseo is 20 miles east of the Quad Cities, at the intersection of Interstate 80, U.S. Route 6 and Illinois Route 82. It is known for its historically successful high school football and music programs, and Victorian architecture.

==History==
Geneseo was founded as a Christian colony in 1836 by seven families of the Congregationalist denomination from Geneseo, New York and Bergen, New York seeking to establish a &quot;church in the wilderness&quot;. Roderick R. Stewart, one of the city&#x27;s founding members, named the town Geneseo after the settlers&#x27; town of origin in New York. The name &quot;Geneseo&quot; is a variation of the Iroquois word Genesee, meaning &quot;shining valley&quot; or &quot;beautiful valley&quot;.

===Establishment===
Planning for the colony began as early as 1829. In May 1836 the founding seven families of Geneseo sent an exploratory committee to survey the precise location of their new community in the Old Northwest. This group, known as the &quot;New York Committee&quot;, or &quot;New York Group&quot; was composed of John C. Ward, Lukas T. Seyller, and Roderick R. Stewart. Advised at a meeting in Chicago by the future Governor of Illinois, Thomas Ford, the small committee rode by wagon and horseback to investigate the 2,000-acre tract. The transaction of the land was completed in what is today Colona Township and purchased at a dollar and a quarter per acre.
On September 17, 1836, the settlers embarked on their journey from Geneseo, New York and Genesee County, New York across Canada, down through Michigan, then across Indiana and Illinois. The subsequent winter was so bad that the families remained in Princeton, Illinois and what was known as Providence County while their structures were being established. Cromwell K. Bartlett constructed the first structure just south of the town in the winter of 1836, and Elisha Cone and J.C. Ward built the first cabin and frame house in town, respectively, in 1837. 

The town was split into lots by the trustees: John C. Ward, Cromwell K. Bartlett, and R.R. Stewart. They split the land into five blocks east to west and three blocks north to south with locations for a cemetery, a block for the school and church, a public square, and the &quot;gospel lot,&quot; which, in 1846, became a seminary. Lots would be drawn by chance, assuming that the settlers would build on them, and immediately the town established its Christian and education-focused philosophy. A mandatory tithe on all proceeds (over a certain amount) was set aside to build a religious and educational seminary in the center of town, now the Geneseo City Park. This building, originally known as the Geneseo Manual Labor High School, was later renamed the Geneseo Seminary and was borne of the self-denial philosophy of the town&#x27;s leaders. However, due to considerable debt, the Geneseo Seminary ended up closing in the year 1857 and was folded into the public school system as Geneseo Central School.

Further proving their religious and educational convictions, when many of the town&#x27;s founding families hadn&#x27;t arrived and while the remainder battled frostbite, the settlers began a temperance society in 1836 with several families in Hanna Township and Cleveland, Illinois. Construction on the original First Congregationalist Church began in 1837 and its first communion was held on April 18, 1838. The Congregationalist Church was a central fixture of the town&#x27;s community in its first century.

These strong religious beliefs also strongly influenced the town&#x27;s political leanings as well, being strong abolitionists and Republicans. As a result, Geneseo became a station on the Underground Railroad.Even before the church was constructed, the first school was established when R.R. Stewart&#x27;s daughter, Susannah Stewart, began teaching classes in a one-room school house in 1837. It was built with puncheon floors, round poles, and the old wagon covers they used to make the journey.

===Expansion===
The Chicago, Rock Island, and Pacific Railroad, also known as the Rock Island Line, was surveyed in 1850 to run from Chicago to Rock Island with a prominent stop in Geneseo. The line was completed in June 1854 and, immediately thereafter, the Grand Excursion promotional voyage that took prominent politicians and well-off citizens on a voyage to and down the Mississippi, stopped in the small town. Although Geneseo had grown at a near stand-still since its inception, reaching only 500 persons by 1850, it soon exploded to 5,500 just 11 years later (within the 10-square mile area). Due to its large growth, Geneseo officially became a town in 1855 and a city in 1865. Like many towns that experienced a growth spurt in the middle of the 19th century, Geneseo&#x27;s wealthier families constructed many of their homes in accordance with Victorian Architecture and a large number of them remain today, giving credence to the name &quot;Victorian Geneseo.&quot;

Simultaneously with the expansion of the town, Geneseo&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Geneseo Democratic Standard&quot;, started in August 1855 by James Bowie. It collapsed not a year and a half later. In June 1856, I.S. Hyatt founded the &quot;Geneseo Republic&quot; and began publishing in a building on Main Street. Although founded as a Republican Party newspaper, it is no longer affiliated with any political party. It is still in operation and remains the only Geneseo-only newspaper.

Geneseo Central School, the first high school in Geneseo, was built in 1856 and became coalesced with Geneseo Seminary in 1857. It was used until 1866 when the North Side Building, was constructed. It was expanded in 1871 and was demolished in 1970. South Side School, constructed by John W. Ross in 1889 on the corner of College Avenue and Second Street, became the official high school for Geneseo in 1890.

In 1883, two higher-education institutions were established in Geneseo: the Geneseo Collegiate Institute (GCI) and the Northwestern Normal School (NNS). GCI was a Presbyterian academy which housed a small religious high school for a time. Although a large expansion was planned for GCI in the early 1900s, the school financially collapsed in 1922 and was razed in 1930. The Northwestern Normal School was a secular college. It, too, collapsed financially and in 1901 John C. Hammond purchased NNS&#x27; old dormitory and presented it to the City of Geneseo to establish Hammond Henry Hospital on November 28, 1901.

===20th century school expansion===
In 1909 the Township High School District was established. It received a major expansion in 1932.&lt;ref name=&quot;III district/facts.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Officially known as Township High School, it was erected between 1910 and 1911 The old South Side School was then used as an additional grade school for K-8 students until a new junior high was built in 1954. South Side was then used as an administrative building until the 1960s when it was demolished to make room for a new district unit office. In the 1960s, Geneseo High School switched places with Geneseo Junior High and became J.D. Darnall Senior High School (until reverting to Geneseo High School in 2005). The old &quot;Township High School&quot; was then used as Geneseo Junior High School until the 1990s when Geneseo Middle School was built next door to J.D. Darnall. Township High was subsequently demolished for additional space for the city park.

Kewanee was once known for its fire-tube boiler industry. The Kewanee Boiler Corporation manufactured and sold boilers throughout the world for over one hundred years. The company shuttered in 2002, however, boilers manufactured in Kewanee are still in common use. The Kewanee High School athletic teams are nicknamed the &quot;Boilermakers&quot;. In 2023, the boiler shop burned down and now has a sign that says &quot;Kewanee Boiler Workers Memorial, dedicated to over 130 years of boiler-making.&quot;

Kewanee was home to minor league baseball. The Kewanee Boilermakers minor league baseball team played in the Central Association from 1908–1913. In 1948–1949, the Kewanee A&#x27;s rejoined the Central Association. Kewanee was an affiliate of the Philadelphia Athletics (1948–1949). Kewanee minor league teams played at Terminal Park (1908–1913) and Northeast Park (1948–1949).

==Parks==
Kewanee has many different types of parks in the immediate area, offering a variety of activities such as boating, camping, hunting, fishing, playgrounds, baseball fields, and more. Parks inside the city limits are run by the Kewanee Park District.

==Schools==
Kewanee has had two school districts, dating to when the community of Wethersfield was a separate municipality. Though the towns merged long ago, the two school districts both remain in the city of 13,400, divided at Division Street in the middle of Kewanee. While Kewanee School District #229 has around 2,015 students (533 High School), Wethersfield #230 has about 600 students. The two schools enjoy a usually friendly rivalry, since both district high schools are in different divisions for most sports. However, this rivalry did become very heated in the sports the two high schools once competed in, most notably basketball. Black Hawk College-East Campus is recognized nationally for its equestrian program, as well as livestock judging teams. (Another Campus is located in the Quad Cities.)

==Festivals==
The most notable festival held in the community is Hog Days. It is held annually on Labor Day weekend. Events include a carnival, mud volleyball, a parade, and more.

<text>Beaverville (formerly St. Marie) is a village in Beaverville Township, Iroquois County, Illinois, United States. The population was 306 at the 2020 census.

==History==

In 1851, 32 families from the area of Montreal, Canada, mostly newlywed or single, came up the St. Lawrence River in search of farmland on the prairie. They traveled across the Great Lakes and stopped at Fort Dearborn (Chicago). Then they pushed south through the swamps and frontier until they reached the area that is now Beaverville. The settlement, named &quot;St. Marie,&quot; was led by Francis Besse, who became a general merchant. The group consisted of families with names such as Fortin, Dionne, Boudreau, Benoit, Nourie, Lafond, Lemna, and at least six Arseneau families. They settled here because of the good land and the many creeks.

In 1905, the village name was changed to &quot;Beaverville&quot;, when the village founders realized that there was another town in Illinois named St. Mary. The new name was inspired by the profusion of beavers in the area in the early 19th century, when Beaver Lake right across the border in Indiana still existed.

==The Cathedral of the Cornfields==

Beaverville is home to St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church, known as the &quot;Prairie Cathedral&quot; or the &quot;Cathedral of the Cornfields&quot;.

The three ministers, who had been given their land by Mr. Cassady of Danville, played no further role in the development of the town.

Judge Chamberlain was the man most responsible for the early growth of Gilman. He was born in Charlestown, New Hampshire, the son of a lawyer. Chamberlain had served in the New York Legislature and had moved to Iroquois County in 1853. He was elected judge, was active in county politics, and lived in Watseka, Illinois. Chamberlain took as a partner Joseph Thomas ( ? -1858) from nearby Onarga.

The town of Gilman was founded at the point where the Peoria and Oquawka Railroad would soon cross the Illinois Central Railroad. The Peoria and Oquawka became the Toledo, Peoria and Western Railway. In return for establishing a station at Gilman, Octave Chanute, the chief engineer of the Peoria and Oquawka Railroad, asked for and was given one half of all the lots in the original town of Gilman. This was standard practice for the railroad and was done at El Paso, Fairbury and probably other new towns established along the route of the railroad. Town founders were aware that the lots were not personally for Chanute, but for the railroad company; Today Chanute is best known for his publications on aviation and for his assistance to the Wright brothers. Chanute was involved in the foundation of many towns along the railroad, usually in association with local individuals. Railroad companies in Illinois were forbidden to found towns themselves.

Iroquois Democrats had wanted to name the town &quot;Douglas&quot;, after the Illinois senator, but Cruger Secor and Company had been given the right to name the town and they decided to honor Samuel Gilman, a director of that company.

===Original design of Gilman===

The design of Gilman in general followed the standard plan used by the Peoria and Oquawka Railroad. This was based on a Depot Ground, a wider area of railroad-owned land where the tracks pass through a town. In the original town of Gilman, east–west streets were given numbers, 6th to 2nd with Front Street where 1st Street would have been expected. The north–south streets, often given standard tree names in other Peoria and Oquawka towns, were here assigned distinctive local names including Chamberlain, Thomas and Douglas. Except for a slight bend in Central and Chamberlain streets, the plan is generally similar to that of Chatsworth, Fairbury, Gridley and Watseka (platted as &quot;South Middleport&quot;). The Gilman plat was exceptionally large with 73 blocks, most having sixteen lots. Unlike most towns of the era, Gilman never developed a single commercial focus. This was evident early in its history when Beckwith remarked, &quot;The town is the most diffusely settled, probably, of any of like population in the state. It would be very difficult to tell which is the center of the town.&quot;

===Early Gilman===

The first new inhabitant of the area was W. P. Gardner from Pennsylvania, who at first lived in a shanty maintained by the railroad for its workers. When the survey of Gilman was done in September 1857, Gardner built the first house in Gilman. That same fall James Wright built a house in Gilman. This was soon followed by a much more expensive structure, a three-story hotel costing $4,000 with a third-floor assembly area. The first recorded event in Gilman&#x27;s history was a ball held on 22 February 1858 at the hotel to celebrate George Washington&#x27;s birthday. Some of the less respectable young men of the neighborhood objected to the ladies being inside the hotel while they were left out on the frigid street. They began calling for the ladies to come outside and join them. One of those invited guests was the builder of the hotel, a man named Lawrence. Wise in the ways of frontier towns, Lawrence had taken the precaution of bringing a stout stick to the dance. Rushing downstairs he burst out the door swinging his shillelagh and quickly dispersing the rowdies. The ball went on.

D. Harwood was the first merchant to open a store in Gilman which maintained a full stock of goods. The first train through Gilman arrived on 21 September 1857 and was to take local people to the State Fair in Peoria. It was three hours late, but its arrival signaled the start of a period of rapid growth for the new town. The Illinois Central did not begin to run trains until 1858. In 1860 the first school was built; by 1865, the town had 31 buildings. Gilman was officially organized as a town in 1867.

===Continued growth===

By the late 1860s, Gilman had two railroads. The eastern branch of the Illinois Central linked St. Louis and Chicago, while the Toledo Peoria and Western ran east and west across the state, from the Mississippi River to Indiana. Gilman prospered as the place where people and goods were transferred from one railroad to the other. In 1870 newspaper, the &quot;Gilman Star&quot; began publication. The 1870 federal census found Gilman had 761 people. In September 1871, a third railroad, originally called the Gilman, Clinton and Springfield Railroad, opened for business. It was largely funded by local bonds and never enjoyed the success of the earlier railroads. On 5 July 1883 a severe fire damaged much of the town. An electric power plant was built in 1898.

Unlike many local towns, Gilman continued to grow in the twentieth century. In 1920, there were 1,443 people. In 1923 and 1924, the state of Illinois began building a new &quot;hard road&quot; paralleling the Toledo Peoria and Western Railroad, which was at first called the Corn Belt Trail, but soon became U.S. Route 24. A second new road, paralleling the Illinois Central Railroad through Iroquois County, initially known as the Egyptian Trail, evolved into Interstate 57 in the 1970s. In the last decade, a second water tower was built along Interstate 57 on the western side of Gilman.

==History==
Onarga was originally laid out in the mid-19th century alongside the development of the railroad from Chicago. Because of its close proximity to Spring Creek, Onarga was one of the first settled areas of Iroquois County. The town grew rapidly had population growth but it leveled off and it now maintains small population.

The name Onarga likely comes from an Iroquois name meaning &quot;a place of rocky hills.&quot;

Onarga has tree and shrub nurseries that have been in business for over 100 years, earning Onarga the nickname, &quot;The Nursery Capital of the Midwest.&quot; Many fields surrounding the town bear rows of trees and bushes rather than corn and soybeans, which are otherwise ubiquitous throughout the region. The prosperous nursery businesses have led to a great amount of ethnic diversity in Onarga, as many Mexican and Mexican-American migrant workers have chosen to maintain roots in the community.

Onarga celebrated its sesquicentennial with a nearly week-long festival in the summer of 2004, which included social events and a strong focus on the history of the community.

Onarga is the final resting place of Civil War spy and Pinkerton detective Timothy Webster. Onarga was also the location of Allan Pinkerton&#x27;s weekend estate, The Larches.

Incorporated in 1865, the name &quot;Watseka&quot; derives from the Potawatomi name &quot;Watch-e-kee&quot;, &quot;Daughter of the Evening Star&quot;, the wife of early eastern Illinois settler Gurdon Saltonstall Hubbard.

The Old Iroquois County Courthouse was constructed in 1866, with two additions built in 1881 and 1927. In the early 1960s, an Iroquois County resident, Mrs. Katherine Clifton, bequeathed to the county in her will a large sum of money and a site upon which to build a new courthouse. It is the only courthouse in the United States built entirely with private funds.

The old courthouse was advertised for sale and fell into disuse. In 1967, during the Centennial Celebration of Watseka, the Iroquois County Historical Society was organized, and circulated petitions throughout the county not to sell the Old Courthouse. The petitions were approved by the County Board of Supervisors, and the Old Courthouse re-opened as a museum that same year. In 1975, the Old Courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Dowell is a village in Jackson County, Illinois, United States. The population was 368 at the 2020 census,
down from 408 at the 2010 census.

== History ==

Dowell was founded as a coal town and named by Du Quoin attorney George Dowell and William Lafont. They requested bids for property development as early as 1917. In 1922, the town&#x27;s population was over 2,000.

In February 1920, the Dowell State Bank was opened in the town. Town founders George Dowell and William Lafont were among the first directors of the bank. It was the scene of a bank robbery on September 30, 1924. The bank closed in 1932 following embezzlement charges against its president, William Lafont.

In late 1920, construction began on a railroad depot serving the Illinois Central Railroad.

Coal mining brought many eastern European immigrants to the village, including Rusyns. At one time there was a Russian Orthodox church which is now closed- the area is still served by the Holy Protection Church church in nearby Royalton.

===Kathleen Coal Mine===

The town has supported miners from local coal mines. The Kathleen Coal Mine was located northeast of the village. It was opened and operated by the Union Colliery Company. 
It was the scene of a disaster in 1921 and again in 1936. In early 1937, it was the largest producing mine in Jackson county, producing over 5,000 tons of coal per day and employing over 500 men.

The mine was closed in November 1946 after the coal vein was no longer accessible. On the site as of December 2021 is Cobin&#x27;s Salvage Yard. There are few remaining signs of the mine that once built the village of Dowell. A small concrete structure, the mine tipple, is the only structure that remains from the mine.

A second mine, known as the &quot;New Kathleen&quot;, was opened in January 1946. This second mine closed by 1958., Land scars are still visible from this mine.

===Baseball Team===

The town hosted a baseball team that consisted of players who worked in the Kathleen Mine. The team was named the &quot;Dowell Kathleens&quot;. They occasionally played against the St. Louis Browns, a professional team, as well as the Belleville Stags, a minor league team.

== Dowell today ==

<text>Grand Tower is a city in Jackson County, Illinois, United States. The population was 479 at the 2020 census. The town gets its name from Tower Rock, a landmark island in the Mississippi River.

== History ==
Former names of this town include &quot;La Tour&quot; (&quot;The Tower&quot;), Jenkins Landing, Cochran&#x27;s Woodyard Landing, and Evans&#x27; Landing.

The earliest inhabitants were a band of river pirates, who settled here after being driven off Spanish soil west of the Mississippi River, near the pirate ambush spot of Tower Rock. This outlaw settlement was destroyed by the United States Army dragoons in 1803. A subsequent settler was a man named Walker, who is the namesake of Walker Hill.

Severe flooding struck the town in 1947.

==History==
Newton is the largest, oldest and only city (although there are several villages) in Jasper County. Because of its favorable location within the county, it was named county seat in 1835.

Jasper County was formed in 1831 and approved on December 19, 1834. The county was named after Revolutionary War hero Sergeant Jasper. He and his close friend, Sergeant Newton, were patriots that saved American prisoners of war from certain death at the hands of British soldiers. Thus, the county and town became their namesakes.

A post office was established in Newton in March 1883. The post office was not established in a building, but rather in a man&#x27;s hat. A rider brought the mail from Vincennes, Indiana, made a stop in Newton once a week and then continued delivering mail on his route north of Newton.

By 1841 the town had increased to five families. Lawrence Hollenbock and Samuel Garwood built a saw- and gristmill, and Benjamin Harris opened the first grocery store in Newton. In 1855, Newton had Miller&#x27;s Hotel and a small inn known as the American House that is now Yesterday&#x27;s Pub and Dining.

By 1865, the population of Newton had grown to 300; a decade later the population had reached 400. In 1874 Joe Litzelman&#x27;s Hack Express began traveling daily to and from Olney on what is now Route 130.

Today, Newton has a population near 3,000. The community is made up of local businesses, industry, a high school of around 500 students and several organizations and churches. Downtown Newton is thriving after the completion of new lighting and a streetscape project. There are many organizations that are keeping Newton moving forward including the Jasper County Chamber of Commerce, JEDI, 100 Women Who Care, Eagle For Life, and many more.

==Education==
Newton resides in the Jasper County Community Unit School District 1, which is geographically the largest school district in Illinois. The schools in the town include Newton Community High School/Jasper County Junior High, Newton Elementary and Saint Thomas Elementary School.

<text>Ste. Marie is a village in Jasper County, Illinois, United States, along the Embarras River. The population was 238 at the 2020 census.

==Early history==

In the early 1800s, some French had become greatly concerned and dismayed by the effects on the Catholic Church from the French Revolution and the attacks by unbelieving philosophers. Some families, including the Picquets, began to consider emigrating in order to establish elsewhere a new social order based on the principles of the Gospel. In 1835, 19-year-old Joseph Picquet was sent to the United States to &quot;spy out the land&quot; and report back to the family. Joseph landed in New York and worked for nine months in a business house in Philadelphia. In early 1836, Joseph began his exploration of the country. His travels took him to Pittsburgh; Lima, Ohio; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Indianapolis; Vincennes, Indiana; Vandalia, Illinois; and St. Louis. Instructed to stay away from large cities, he turned eastward and finally decided on the land in Eastern Illinois that is now Ste. Marie, partly because of its proximity to Vincennes, a strong French city with an availability of priests to say Mass. At that time there was not a single house between Newton and Olney. In October 1836 Joseph returned to France and gave a favorable report of the land.

On January 29, 1837, an association of five including Jacques Picquet, Joseph Picquet, Joseph Schifferstein, Charles Hoffman and Joseph Picquet was formed, with the intent of acquiring and developing land in the United States. A contract was written and signed by the members of the association. On June 20, Joseph returned to the United States with the nucleus of a colony, all related by either blood or marriage, 25 in all, on the ship &quot;Mogul&quot;. Because they were all related, the new settlement was to be named &quot;Colonie des Freres&quot; or &quot;Colony of Brothers&quot;. On July 20, the new immigrants bought a small farm near St. Francisville where they stayed for several months. On October 1, the settlers left St. Francisville and came to begin their new settlement. They boarded with William Price who had a cabin nearby. On October 12, Ferdinand Hartrich, Etienne Lauer and Joseph Picquet went to Palestine and recorded approximately in the Land Office there.

Father Stephen Theodore Badin, a Frenchman, came during this time to bless this work of their own hands and celebrate the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass in their presence. Father Badin was the first Catholic priest ordained in the United States. A stone monument fashioned to look like a log cabin stands on the grounds of the University of Notre Dame as a tribute to him. There is also a mosaic on the east porch of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C. in memory of him.

On October 28, 1837, the settlers gathered on a knoll south of the Embarras River and took formal possession of the land, dedicating the village to the Virgin Mary. The newly acquired land was called &quot;Colonie des Freres&quot;, or &quot;Colony of Brothers&quot;. Eventually the name of the new settlement was changed to &quot;St. Marie&quot;, with the name changing in 1892 to the French feminine version of the spelling.

Joseph Picquet made many more trips back to France to bring other family members to the new colony.

Ste. Marie quickly grew and erected its first church, free school, post office and store. It served as a cultural center amidst miles of wilderness.

==History==
The town of Bluford was named after Bluford &quot;Bluf&quot; Green (1868–1912) when he was a small boy by his father Wiley Green (1835–1878), who was the local justice of the peace. An extended story about Bluford by Mrs. Opal H. Wood states:

In 1881, before there was a Bluford, construction was started on the Air Line Railroad, later the Southern Railroad. George Evans, Mt. Vernon banker, laid out the town on 40 acres of land bisected by the railroad. In 1882, Rev. Z. H. Byard, a United Brethren preacher, built the first store building and dwelling. Byard also was the first postmaster in Bluford, and the first railroad station agent. Bluford was incorporated in 1925. Dwight Bressler was its first mayor.

Bluford spread on both sides of the railroad. The south section unofficially was called Tilford, and the north, Bluford, both being names of the sons of Minerva (Flint) and Wiley Green. When son Tilford died, all the town became Bluford. No reason was given why the boys should have been so honored.

The first settlement in this area was Spring Garden, about four miles southeast of Bonnie. There were several springs in the area. Early in the 19th century, Uriah Compton walled them up and built a resort called &quot;Compton&#x27;s Springs&quot;. In 1848, the village of Spring Garden was platted next to the resort. Spring Garden grew rapidly, becoming the second largest settlement in the County, even having a high school by 1888. In 1905, however, the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad was built about three miles to the west. Spring Garden began a long decline as the business and population shifted to the rail depots at Bonnie and Ina. George Washington Hayes (1842–1927) donated some of the land originally making up Bonnie.

<text>Dix is a village in Jefferson County, Illinois, United States. The population was 469 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Mount Vernon Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Dix is located in northern Jefferson County at (38.440676, -88.942463). Illinois Route 37 is the village&#x27;s Main Street, leading south to Mount Vernon, the county seat, and north to Salem. Interstate 57 passes through the western side of the village, with access from Exit 103. I-57 leads south to Interstate 64 at Mount Vernon and north to Interstate 70 at Effingham.

According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Dix has a total area of , of which (or 99.52%) is land and (or 0.48%) is water. Dix is located on high ground that marks the boundary between the Big Muddy River and its tributary, Casey Creek.

Today Dix is an exit on Interstate 57, a major north/south roadway. When it was founded, however, it was on the Goshen Road, which was the main east/west road in Illinois, running from Old Shawneetown on the Ohio River to near East St. Louis on the Mississippi.

==History==
Among the first settlers around Dix were two brothers named Andrews (Arba and Nelson?), who came from Rome, New York, around 1830. One of them established a post office called &quot;Jordan&#x27;s Prairie&quot;, the name already given to the grassland to the south. Later he platted out a village, which he called &quot;Rome&quot;, after his home town in New York. The post office was moved into the village in 1852, and the name changed.

Hiram Milburn of Kell, Illinois, moved to Rome between 1853 and 1855. Milburn built a storehouse in 1853 and a hotel in 1854. It is said that during the construction of the hotel, a wind blew the structure down into a pile, while two men were on the joists, but nobody was hurt. In 1855 Milburn purchased Leuty&#x27;s Mill and moved it to Rome.

Although Rome Township still exists, the name of the post office was changed to &quot;Dix&quot; in 1865. There was and still is another Rome, Illinois, and the Postal Service insisted that the name of this village be changed. The community incorporated as the village of Rome in 1873. The name of the village was not legally changed to Dix until the 1960s.

There are several stories as to the origin of the name &quot;Dix&quot;. One is that the town was renamed in honor of General John Adams Dix. At the outbreak of the Civil War, General Dix sent a telegram to his agents in New Orleans stating: &quot;If any man pulls down the American flag, shoot him on the spot.&quot; Although the telegram was intercepted by Confederate agents and never reached its intended recipient, the text reached the press, and General Dix became one of the first heroes in the North.

Dix is served by the Norfolk Southern Railway. This was built around 1890. The rail line comes from the St. Louis area and turns southeast at Dix. It follows the west side of Casey Creek down to Mt. Vernon.

<doc id="111337" wikidata="Q2600028" url="?curid=111337" title="Ina, Illinois">
<text>Ina is a village in Jefferson County, Illinois, United States. The population was 1,641 as of the 2020 census. It is part of the Mount Vernon Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Ina is located along Illinois Route 37 which is the village&#x27;s Main Street, and Interstate 57 runs through the west side of town, with access from Exit 83. Mount Vernon, the Jefferson county seat, is to the north, and Benton is the same distance to the south.

According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Ina has a total area of , all land.

Ina is located on high ground between Casey Creek and Gun Creek, both tributaries of the Big Muddy River. The Big Muddy has been dammed to form Rend Lake, with arms of the lake extending up the two tributaries.

Ina is the home of the Big Muddy River Correctional Center. Rend Lake College, with an Ina mailing address, is outside the village limits to the southwest.

==History==
Many Cherokee families settled in Ina around 1840. They were apparently refugees from the Trail of Tears. In the 1800s, Ina was jokingly referred to as &quot;the Cherokee Reservation&quot;.

The main settlement in this area was Spring Garden, about northeast of Ina. Spring Garden prospered from 1848 until the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad was built in 1905. After that, the population and business shifted over to the depots at Ina and Bonnie.

=== Crimes ===
An infamous murder case occurred in Ina in 1924, when Rev. Lawrence Hight and his lover Elsie Sweeten poisoned Sweeten&#x27;s husband in July and Hight&#x27;s wife in September. Autopsies revealed arsenic. Hight and Sweeten were both sent to prison. Elsie Sweeten was granted another trial and was later acquitted of murder and released from jail.
Over six decades later a quadruple homicide occurred outside of town. The victims were the Dardeen family, who lived in a mobile home on Illinois Route 37 just north of the Franklin County line. One evening in November 1987, the police came to the house since Keith Dardeen had not shown up for his job at the Rend Lake Water Conservancy District treatment plant that morning and did not answer phone calls. Elaine had not been raped, valuable items remained in the house, and police found no reason why anyone might want to have killed the family. Serial killer Tommy Lynn Sells confessed to the crime after he was arrested in Texas in 2000; however, police and the other members of the Dardeen family did not completely believe his accounts, which he changed three times, and he did not seem to know any nonpublic information about the crime. He was never charged before his 2014 execution, and officially the Dardeens&#x27; killings remain unsolved.

<text>Mount Vernon is a city in and the county seat of Jefferson County, Illinois, United States. The population was 14,600 at the 2020 census. Mount Vernon is the principal city of the Mount Vernon Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Jefferson and Hamilton counties.

==History==
===19th century===
Mt. Vernon was founded in 1817 by Zadok Casey, who was elected to the State Senate in 1822 and was elected lieutenant governor in 1833. He served in the U.S. Congress between 1833 and 1843. The town was named for George Washington&#x27;s plantation, Mount Vernon, which was named for Edward Vernon, a British naval hero.

When the town was founded, there was no road to it. Travelers had to get there by either following the high ground from the north or crossing the swamps from the south. In the early 19th century the Goshen Road crossed Illinois in a northwesterly direction from Old Shawneetown, Illinois to the Goshen Settlement, near what is now Edwardsville. This road was the main road in Illinois. When Mt. Vernon was first settled, the Goshen Road made a wide arc across Jefferson County, crossing Casey Creek and the Big Muddy north of Mt. Vernon, avoiding the swamps to the south, but bypassing Mt. Vernon. The road entered the county at its southeast corner. It passed through, or near, what are now Opdyke, East Salem, Idlewood, Dix and Walnut Hill. However, it was apparent to the early settlers that the town would fail without roads. In 1820–1821, Ben Hood and Carter Wilkey built a bridge over Casey Creek, to the southeast of town. This bridge was near the present bridge on Illinois Route 142. A road was built from there northwest, over ground that is now impassable, toward the old cemetery behind the modern Bethel Cemetery. Deep cuts through the old cemetery attest to the location of the road. From there the road probably followed modern Route 37 into town, somewhere shifting from 10th Street on west to 12th Street.

After the state capital was moved to Vandalia in 1819, it became apparent that a road to Vandalia was needed. A party was sent out to the northwest to mark the road. In 1823, Thomas D. Minor and William Maxwell built the &quot;Vandalia Road&quot;, now called the &quot;Old Centralia Road.&quot; It runs northwest out of Mt. Vernon to Walnut Hill. Although legend says that this road is crooked because of the drunken state of the surveyors, the path is probably just the natural path of a pioneer road following the terrain. After the bridge and the Vandalia Road were built, Mt. Vernon was &quot;on the map.&quot; The bridge across Casey Creek and the Vandalia Road provided a much shorter path across Jefferson County than the original Goshen Road. The new Goshen Road soon captured most of the traffic, and Mt. Vernon became an important stop on the road west.

In 1836, Joshua Grant came to Mt. Vernon from Christian County, Kentucky with several of his sons and daughters. His family was a wealthy slave-owning family, most of whom soon moved to Arkansas, probably because slavery was illegal in Illinois. Joshua left behind several daughters and one son, Angus McNeil Grant, who soon became important in the development of the town. &quot;Upon his arrival, there were but four or five houses in the place, and from that time to the present (1883) he has constantly and ably exerted himself in securing to it the full development of its resources.&quot; Angus M. Grant&#x27;s brother, Joshua Jr. taught school in Mt. Vernon in 1838. Some sources cite him as the first schoolteacher in the town.

In 1848, in accordance with the new constitution of Illinois, the Illinois Supreme Court first Grand Division was relocated to Mt. Vernon. There were three divisions total comprised for the first (southern), second (central) and third (northern) areas of the state. The 5th District Appellate Court was constructed in 1854 and is still in use as the Appellate Court House. When the Supreme Court was in session, the important lawyers in Illinois, including Abraham Lincoln, gathered in Mt. Vernon to argue their cases. The lawyers gathered at the Mt. Vernon Inn, owned by Angus McNeil Grant and his in-laws, the Andersons. This building has been on the National Register of Historic Places since July 2, 1973.

In the 1870s, Mt. Vernon for a time prohibited the sale of alcohol. A village called &quot;East Mt. Vernon&quot; was organized in 1877 to allow the sale of alcohol. A court fight eventually held that the village was organized illegally. Mt. Vernon then voted alcohol back in, and the area of East Mt. Vernon was annexed into the city.

On February 19, 1888, a tornado cut a path a half mile wide through Mt. Vernon, killing 37 people and destroying more than 450 houses. The Jefferson County Courthouse was destroyed. This event was one of the first disasters to which the American Red Cross responded. Clara Barton herself directed the relief efforts.

The Mt. Vernon Car Manufacturing Company opened in 1889 after moving from Litchfield, Illinois. This relocation may have been an outgrowth of the relief efforts following the tornado. The Louisville and Nashville Railroad hauled in some 1,900 carloads of supplies for reconstruction of the town. Somehow, this effort translated into a major business building railroad cars, at first building about ten cars per day. By 1909, the car shops were producing 25 cars per day, employing more than 1000 workers, with a payroll of $60,000 per month.

===20th and 21st centuries===
During World War II, portions of the &quot;Car Shops&quot;, as they had to come to be known, were converted over to wartime production, including the production of bomb casings. Around 1939, a portion of the car shops was purchased by Precision Engineering, which originally built components for locomotives. During the 1970s, this company purchased old diesel/electric railroad locomotives, which it scrapped out or refurbished. Today, the plant thrives as a hub for National Railway Equipment Company which rebuilds and services diesel electric locomotives for rail lines across the globe.

In 1954, the car shops closed, causing a temporary jump in unemployment throughout the city and the 108 communities called &quot;home&quot; by its former employees.

The Interstate Highway System was built in the late 1950s and 1960s. The concurrency of I-57 and I-64 is along the western border of the ridgeline which divides the Big Muddy River and Casey Creek. The stack interchange on the southwest side of town complements the historic Casey Creek bridges, allowing much shorter travel times through the swamps to the east and south.

In April 2007, Mount Vernon voters elected the first female mayor of the city, Mary Jane Chesley. She was sworn into office on May 7, 2007.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Mount Vernon has a total area of , of which (or 99.38%) is land and (or 0.62%) is water.

The community is about east of St. Louis, Missouri.

Mt. Vernon is located on high ground between Casey Creek and the Big Muddy River, which join south of the town in what is now Rend Lake. In pre-settlement times the area around these waterways was a swamp, a heavily forested area that was waist-deep in water during much of the winter and during wet summers. Mt. Vernon was thus often surrounded by water and swamp on three sides.

High ground was located to the north of Mt. Vernon. A ridge ran between the Big Muddy River and Casey Creek north toward what is now Dix.

There are high places both west and east of Mt. Vernon from which one can see the town as a forested point of high ground jutting out into the bottoms. These high places are: from the west, near the Woodlawn interchange off Interstate 64 and from the east, on Old Fairfield Road near Summersville School, with the highest point located on Old Route 15 right before it merges with New Route 15, near Bluford.

<doc id="111340" wikidata="Q2118225" url="?curid=111340" title="Waltonville, Illinois">
<text>Waltonville is a village in Jefferson County, Illinois, United States. The population was 408 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Mount Vernon Micropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==

There were a series of small settlements near Waltonville prior to its formation. In 1840, Eli Gilbert dammed Rayse Creek about a mile northeast of Waltonville, near the point where the Mt. Vernon/Pinckneyville road crossed the creek. He built a saw mill, grist mill and store at this location, which was called &quot;Mill Town&quot;. In 1860, Knob Creek Post Office was opened there. This was in McClellan Township.

In 1867, a settlement called Williamsburg was started, about a half mile west of Mill Town. This was in Knob Prairie, Blissville Township, just to the north of the present town of Waltonville. Knob Prairie owes its name to a steep hill, or knob, that arises just to the northwest of Waltonville. The town&#x27;s water tower sits atop the knob.

Williamsburg was platted in 1867. It was possibly named for the surveyor, J. D. Williams. Williamsburg was at the intersection of the Shawneetown/Nashville and Mt. Vernon/Pinckneyville roads, neither of which exist any more. After the post office refused to recognize the &quot;Williamsburg&quot; name, it was called the &quot;Laur Post Office&quot;, after Capt. Joseph Laur, who commanded a local company in the Civil War.

Waltonville, to the south of the knob, started as a small store owned by Rob Mannen. The town was named for his mother, Eliza A. Walton Mannen. The town took off in 1893 with the completion of a rail line from Mt. Vernon to Chester. Williamsburg moved down to the new rail depot. The rail line is now part of the Union Pacific system.

The Universalist Church existed in Williamsburg prior to 1870, and moved to Waltonville before 1906. This church was still operating as late as 1980. Waltonville was for many years the smallest town in the United States to have a Universalist Church. This may be another reflection of the numerous obscure ethnic groups that maintained an identity in the rural coal fields of Southern Illinois.

Many underground coal mines were opened near Waltonville. Immigrants came to work these mines, mainly from Poland. By the 1950s, the rural areas west of Waltonville were predominantly Polish, and the main language spoken was Polish. That language slowly faded with the advent of television. Today, only a few people speak any Polish. Many still identify as Polish, though, and they continue to attend St. Barbara&#x27;s Catholic Church in nearby Scheller.

==Geography==
Waltonville is located in southwestern Jefferson County. Illinois Route 148 passes through the southeast part of the village, leading northeast to Mount Vernon, the county seat, and south to Sesser.

According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Waltonville has a total area of , of which (or 98.33%) is land and (or 1.67%) is water.

Waltonville is in the northeast corner of Bald Hill Township, the southeast corner of Blissville Township, the southeast corner of McClellan Township, and the northwest corner of Elk Prairie Township. Most of the developed parts of the village are in Bald Hill and Elk Prairie townships.

Blissville Township was named in honor of Augustus Bliss, who lived in nearby Casner Township, and who started a settlement in 1841. Blissville was located about northwest of Waltonville. Bliss caught the gold fever in 1849, but died of cholera on his way to California.

<text>Elsah is a village in Jersey County, Illinois. As of the 2020 census, the village had a total population of 519. Michael Pitchford is the village&#x27;s current acting mayor.

It is the home of Principia College.

Elsah is a part of the Metro-East region and the St. Louis Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Elsah is located at (38.953720, -90.354732).

According to the 2010 census, the village has a total area of , all land.

== History ==
James Semple, a local lawyer, prominent politician and United States Senator from Illinois, founded Elsah in 1853 and offered free lots to anyone who built houses with stone from his quarry. It is believed that he named the village of Elsah after Ailsa Craig, the last outcropping his family saw as they departed Scotland for the United States. By 1861, the village had grown to its current size, as geographic and economic limitations prevented further expansion.

Although Elsah has been described as the &quot;New England of the Midwest,&quot; the village is not a New England prototype derived from 18th century colonial styles. Rather, the architecture found in Elsah demonstrates 19th century styles and fashions including Greek Revival, Gothic Revival, Mansard, Italianate, Saltbox, and Gambrel. Elsah prospered as the main shipping point for the agricultural goods produced by the farmers of Jersey County. The village&#x27;s importance diminished with the coming of the railroad, later being revitalized when Principia College was established in the 1930s.

Eliestoun House was completed in 1890 by Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow Jr. The house is on the grounds of Principia College and named after &quot;&#x27;Elliestoun Tower&#x27; on Castle Semple Loch&quot; which is part of the Lands of Elliston in Scotland. Henry Turner and his wife Ada Ames had the house built. Ada is a descendant of James Semple.

Elsah remained mainly a quiet village until the opening of the Great River Road (Illinois Route 100) in 1964. Elsah is a community whose homes are privately owned. In 1973, the entire village was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Great Flood of 1993 caused significant damage to many of the village&#x27;s structures.

The historic commercial district on LaSalle Street, which extends three blocks inward from the river, consists mainly of stone buildings; all but one of its pre-1861 buildings, including all four of the village&#x27;s historic taverns, still stand. The other two districts are both located on Mill Street and are primarily residential; the larger one is three blocks long and has an assortment of stone and brick houses, while the smaller section has a single block of Greek Revival homes.

Today, Elsah&#x27;s proximity to bald eagle watching locations make it a popular destination during the fall and winter seasons. Elsah&#x27;s location on the Sam Vadalabene Bike Trail also makes it a popular stop for bicyclists enjoying the Great River Road in any season.

<text>Fidelity is a village in Jersey County, Illinois, United States, located about thirty-five miles north of Saint Louis, Missouri. As of the 2020 census, the village had a total population of 96.

The village is usually noted for its postmark.

==Geography==
Fidelity is located at (39.154636, -90.163947).

According to the 2010 census, Fidelity has a total area of , all land.

==History==
In 1829, people from Tennessee reportedly traveled across this site. According to local legend, a horse belonging to settler Joseph Russell went lame, stranding Russell, who was offered a replacement horse by another settler, Samuel Simmons.

The legend continues that Russell replied, &quot;That&#x27;s true fidelity.&quot;

In another version of events, Joseph Russell and his brother William were traveling from Hawkins County, TN, to Missouri. They were looking for cheap, good land. They set up camp in present day Fidelity. They hobbled their horses and went to sleep. When they woke, they found that William&#x27;s horse had tried to escape and injured its foot. Stuck with only one horse, William said &quot;Joseph, you take my horse to finish the trip and get back to East Tennessee, and I&#x27;ll stay here and keep your horse with me until his foot gets well.&quot; William exclaimed &quot;Well, that&#x27;s what I call real fidelity!&quot; William continued to St Louis, surveyed a tract of land, and went back to Tennessee. On July 31, 1849, William wrote to Joseph about his intentions to name the town &quot; Fidelity.&quot;

Simmons built a log cabin there, and in 1850, Russell and his brother also settled in the area. The Russell brothers are credited with having ensured the town was officially named &quot;Fidelity&quot;. A post office was established in the village in 1854. During the mid-20th century, Fidelity was reportedly the site of &quot;a small Army barracks, grain elevator, several doctors and dentists, a blacksmith shop and grocery stores.&quot;

Since then, Fidelity has become a tiny village made up mostly of small homes. The post office is now the only remaining business and its postmark has enjoyed some popularity for use on Valentine&#x27;s Day greetings, with several hundred requests for cancellations received from addresses both in the United States and around the world each year.

<text>Grafton is the oldest city in Jersey County, Illinois, United States. It is located near the confluence of the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers. As of the 2020 census, the city had a total population of 626. Prior to the Great Flood of 1993, Grafton had enjoyed a stable population of nearly 1,000 residents.

Grafton is a part of the Metro-East region and Greater St. Louis.

==History==
Founded in 1832 by James Mason, Grafton is the oldest city in Jersey County. Described as having &quot;a post office, one store, one tavern, and a number of families&quot; in 1834, the area was being settled as early as 1812 when a blockhouse was built at the confluence for protection. The city was named after Mason&#x27;s birthplace of Grafton, Massachusetts. Grafton was incorporated on May 16, 1907.

Grafton&#x27;s population reached its peak at approximately 10,000 in the 1850s with employment opportunities coming from the local stone quarries, boat building and commercial fishing. At one point, there were five quarries in or around Grafton that employed nearly 2,000 men. The local limestone was used to build the Eads Bridge in St. Louis, government buildings in Rock Island, and the Jersey County Courthouse in Jerseyville. The Shafer&#x27;s Wharf Historic District was one of the largest commercial fishing centers along the Mississippi River in the late 19th century. The Old Boatworks, located south of Main Street, once housed a paint house and a machine shop where paddle wheelers and later PT boats were built. Today, the Old Boatworks building hosts many antique and craft stalls and is open on the fourth weekend of each month from May through October.

The Great Flood of 1993 caused significant damage to many of Grafton&#x27;s structures, and a third of the city&#x27;s residents moved away. The effects of the flood are still evident and the city&#x27;s population has not recovered.

<text>Jerseyville is the largest city in and the county seat of Jersey County, Illinois, United States. At the 2020 census, the city had a total population of 8,337.

Jerseyville is a part of Southern Illinois, the Metro-East region and the St. Louis Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
In 1827, James Faulkner, a Pennsylvania native, and his family built a small framed structure that was named the &quot;Little Red House,&quot; in the area that is now known as Jerseyville. The &quot;Little Red House&quot; served as the first stagecoach station, first tavern, first school, and first bank in the immediate area. By 1834, the small settlement that grew up around Faulkner&#x27;s home, then known as Hickory Grove by its residents, was surveyed and platted by two immigrants from New Jersey, John Lott and Edward M. Daly. Lott and Daly&#x27;s involvement marked the beginning of a proportionally large number of merchants, businessmen and settlers from New Jersey. A meeting was called in that same year at the &quot;Little Red House&quot; to vote for a town name, so a post office could be established. The name of Jerseyville was chosen to honor the native state of many of its inhabitants. In 1839, Jersey County was formed out of Greene County and Jerseyville was named as its county seat.

Jerseyville was a minor stopping point on the historic Underground Railroad before and during the Civil War. The &quot;Little Red House&quot; and a few other residences were utilized as stations for the Underground Railroad until the end of the Civil War, with some residences having false cellars that were used to hide slaves searching for freedom.

After the American Civil War ended, and the construction of the Alton &amp; Chicago Railroad was completed, Jerseyville saw a period of commercial, industrial and urban growth. The first major period of growth in the city occurred from 1880 to 1916, and from that time to the present, Jerseyville&#x27;s growth has since been steady and substantial. The majority of the commercial structures that are now located in the Downtown Historic District and Courthouse Square were built during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was also during this time that the present Jersey County Courthouse was built. The two-story, Romanesque Revival building was completed in 1893, and is considered to be one of the most aesthetic courthouses in the area. Other nearby Victorian style buildings in the city include Queen Anne, Edwardian and Italianate architectural features, with several of these buildings having been recently renovated.

From 1912 to 1918, Jerseyville was the terminus of an interurban electric passenger railroad from Alton which was the stub of a project by the &quot;Alton, Jacksonville and Peoria Railway&quot; for a line to Peoria.

In recent decades, Jerseyville has been a testing ground in the agricultural biotechnology field. Bayer (formerly Monsanto) owns and operates a facility located just south of the city, which in 1987, was the site of the world&#x27;s very first biotechnology field trial – first with tomatoes and later that year with soybeans. The facility was also home to the first triple stacked corn trial in 1998, which later became a part of one of Monsanto&#x27;s top-selling products. The facility was further expanded in 2008, and now consists of sixteen greenhouses and almost of land for field testing.

The Downtown Historic District is presently home to some antique stores and gift shops, some clothing and shoe stores, a pharmacy, public library, post office, and several local restaurants and banks. Most of the growth that has occurred since the early 1990s has been in the southern and southwestern portions of the city, where new residential subdivisions and retail shopping centers have been built, and where numerous land annexations have been made by the city.

==History==
Otterville is the home of the first free integrated school in the United States, the Hamilton Primary School, located on Main Street. In 1834, Dr. Silas Hamilton, a local physician, left $4,000 for the construction and operation of a building for educational and religious purposes. A stone-built school was opened in 1836, and the tuition-free education for local students attracted families to the area. The school was razed in 1872, and was rebuilt and enlarged, with the original stones at the base. Classes were held at the school until 1971. George Washington, a slave freed by Dr. Hamilton, studied here, became successful, and established a perpetual scholarship fund for Americans of African descent. He also provided for the erection of a monument to his former master at the school.

The school was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.

<text>Elizabeth is a village in Jo Daviess County, Illinois, United States. The population was 761 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Prior to European contact, the area where the village stands today was inhabited by the people of the Sac and Fox Nation. It is believed that white settlers had moved into the area starting in the early 1800s due to the prominence of lead in the earth. These mines that were built in Jo Daviess County are considered to be what triggered the 1832 Black Hawk War and the devastating Bad Axe Massacre. The Apple River Fort was built in response to this conflict and on June 24 a battle ensued. The injury and death toll is unknown. This is considered the last Native American offensive battle east of the Mississippi River.

During the battle, it is thought that a woman named Elizabeth Armstrong rallied the locals of the fort to continue the fight and assist the soldiers in any way they could. As a result of the bravery of her and the other women in the camp, the community was renamed from simply the Apple River Settlement to Elizabeth.
Elizabeth was incorporated as a village in 1868.
